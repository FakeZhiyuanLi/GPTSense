Fun to get rid of the show (it was gettin' kinda "used" at the end there) and fun to see if Lars Joachim wins the hole shebang!  Other than that nothin' much have happend here at the Crib. Just a few minor fixies. Got rid of the .php diary and whacked in this  urlLink Blogger-powered-thingy-flinghy . And that my fellas, was the touch of heaven I needed to get my groove on again. (got kinda sick of this thing when it didn't work ya know :p )  Anyways, my inlaws are commin' to visit on Saturday and staying for a week. Gonna be kinda fun to have visitors in our fine flat. Ya know, I was thinkin' on this a few days ago and I came to the conclusion that the only thing missing now is the dog *lol*.  But enough babbling from me....gotta go work some more ya know. I'll be seeing ya.....  PS: remember to give yer daily hails to the king...baby (yup, that king would be me :o) So go do it dammit!

						    time ::  21:33  where ::   at work...  wearing ::   green armypants, gray t-shirt, blue 70s jacket :)  listening to ::  Helloween - The Dark Ride  doing ::   work of course ;) [on a brake now ya know], singing my brains out to the above mentioned song!  having ::  a fuckin' headache cuz of the weather, thus looking all over for some painkillers!  wanting ::  my girl!.....and my shellaccount! Dammit denT!   So, what's new in my world these days? Not much actualy. I'm going on vacation as of tomorrow. Me and my Girl's gonna take a plane back to where I'm from on Saturday. Gonna spend the whole week there (and that means my whole vacation). I'm looking forward to seeing them all again, strangely enough :)  Maybe I'll update some while I'm there, I don't know. Time will show as they say...   I'm considering doing a major change around here. Dunno what and how, but I'm trying to come up with a good idea for when I get my domain. I'm leaning for something in the line of a bloggingcrew site, maybe a place for me and my friends to say our shit. Dunno yet, first and foremost I'll get me that darn domain :)  Oh yeah, I want ye all to go to  urlLink eufori's site . She seems so down lately, maybe we all can cheer her up if we join forces? So get movin', that's an order :) And I'm gonna be the first to congratulate  urlLink miss Nattfall  with her cabelconnection! Congratz baby! We'll never get rid of ye know will we?... *lol*  Yes! I just found my painkillers, whooptidoo! *tossing down a couple*  That'll be all for now, so if y'll exuse moi while I bend over and lick my balls ;)

						    Well, wadday know!   My all-time-fav writer has gotten "digital". Neil Gaiman is currently using  urlLink Blogger.com  and is writing daily updates at  urlLink http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/journal.asp !! I'm hereby setting my self a new goal, I'm going to put all my resurces in getting a hold of Neil Gaiman's e-mail adress :) Not for any aparant reason, I'm just in desperat need of something to chase *lol* I need a challenge!  On the other flip, I'm boooooooored! I'm now over and above the point where I can be bored, and keep my sanity, all at the same time! I'm singing and doing weird shit right now. I'm glad there's no-one else is at work right now :)  But now I gotta pack up, going home for the day. I'll be seing y'all

						    Yessiree!!   I'm now a happy man! Ødegård, one of my oldest and best friends, dropped by tonight. He's in the army (navy to be precise) and he had some shoreleave before he was going out again tomorrow. Anyways, the good news is that he's on leave at the time I'm having my wedding! So that means he can be my best-man! I was hoping for it, but it was a chance he didn't have leave at that time. But he did, and I'm glad he had. Cuz I've known him for about 7 or 8 years and he's one of my closest friends.  But enough chat for now, gotta go to bed now....I'll tell y' more 'bout it later :)

						    N'dang it...   oh well, this is just one of those days i guess....i got nothing to say, but a heep of time to kill. so that's why i'm using lotsah space on writing about how little i got to say to the world :p i even figured i'd check out this fashion i've noticed lately -- yup, you got it right -- writing perfect english in all small letters :) (or at least as perfect as i can make it). dunno why it's so "in" but hey, i'm open for it...  did  some browsing today (as always) and came up with some cool/weird/stupid links i thought i'd share with you   Where do you wanna blow today?  #  urlLink §1  #  urlLink §2  #  urlLink §3  [tnx  urlLink frykitty ] #  urlLink §4  # ...and last but not least, the coolest animecartoon on the web! --  urlLink http://www.exploitationnow.com/  -- you just gotta love it :)  hmm, looks like my short post about how little i have to say suddenly became the long post about how little i  thought  i had to say, but realized otherwise :) but hey, i'm not complaining...  btw, maybe i'm gonna regret saying this, but saturdays party was a blast! i loved it! oh...and while i'm at it. mom/dad, i'm still waiting for an respons to me and  urlLink digiboys  phoneprank! *lol*

						    Yawn and tripple Yawn!   It's 04:45 in phreakin' morning and I've just finished almost my whole fuckin' photogallery! There's only   ONE   partly  unfinished gallery, but I think I'm entitled to that one (and it aint't even a full one).  I'm probably going to write some more about some of the pics but not now, I don't think I've got the braincells left for that right about now, even writing this is hard *yawn*  Good night y'all!  ...zzZZZZzzzzzzzzz

						    urlLink  I couldn't agree more!   Yessiree, I'm all for the  target="_blank"  tag, I hate it when I'm browsing webpages and the link opens in the same window, it makes it easy to get lost. So  urlLink mr.Crash , no no no!  target="_blank"  is a gift from the Gods :p  PS:  base target=_blank  is even better, saves ya so much work :)

						    The pain....   Damn! My head feels like it has Safri Duo banging it's brain right now. It must be the weather, I'm quite sensitive that way. I can't stand moist, heavy weather. I'm constantly walking around with a headache if the weather's like that. At least if I'm inside at the time. If it's a bit windy outside I can survive without painkillers. But that means staying in the wind until the weather lightens up...  But enough whining for now.  I got the groove on today. I really did, and that resulted in a  urlLink photogallery  for yer wiewing pleasure. So now I'd like for a certian person to shut the hell up! (yes, I'm talking about u miss  sarasafari  ;)  I dunno what it is with browsers (read: people browsing trough websites) and pictures, but it seems that it's all they wanna see. None of them cares much for the written word. Sadly the majority of browsers is that way, so y' might say I've sold out in a way. But I don't care, I was going to do this photogallery anyways. It just wasn't the first on my list.  But no that I've started I'll probably keep doing it for a while, at least until I get sick'n tired of re-nameing pics and shit. The hardest part is writing something about the pics. As I look at them, memories pop up. I get flashbacks and my troath sometimes get all cluttered up. I really got a lot to write about all of them but I can't write to much either...the golden center is hard to find. At least I know this much, there's a whole bunch of folks out there I miss a great deal. And specially the folks from my year at Fredheim. I got all cluttered in my troath looking at those pictures, as a matter in fact I'm getting that way right now *sob*  I also miss my folks back home, my mom'n dad, my sister, my best friends....God, I gotta stop now y'all. Never figured digging out all those pictures would get me so ...so...*sob* (and if that wasn't enough, their playing a softtune on the radio right now!)  Mom, Dad, Beate, John Thomas, Ødegård, Vidar, Kris, Thomas, and all the other friends I have -  I love and miss y'all a so phreakin' much!!!

						    Howdy! Wazzup'n all that crap...   As y'all know I challenged  urlLink FryKitty  to a "24-hours-and-as-many-as-we-can-survive-blog" in the last post, but I think she might have missunderstod (spell error?) me. I wasn't reffering to the  urlLink "charity blog"  she's planning, cuz I can't atend that one. I'm sorry to say it, but I got other things planed that weekend... What I was trying to get to was that I'm going to crush her  urlLink 24-blog thingy  with as many hours I can. And I'm more than hoping that when I get around to actualy doing the darn thing, she and any other fellow blogger who wanna go at it, tries to beat my number of hours :) Oh..btw, if 24 isn't the longest one yet, then tell me will ya!!! I don't wanna come short ya know :p So there ye have it. I'm not atending the  urlLink "charity blog" . I'm just trying to create some fun for y'all :)  And if this doesn't create any type of response whatsoever, I'll probably go into a deep coma.......so be nice!   On a different note, I'm currently looking for some helpful souls who are familiar with various graphical programs. I need some type of banner for my site, and maybe a cool heading-banner too, something that can be a substitute for the linkframe on top here.  urlLink E-mail  me if ye wanna help me out, okay?  That'll be all for now...

						    Getting an idea...   When I entered  urlLink Blogger.com  today I stumbled into a little entry about  urlLink FryKitty  and her  urlLink "Blogging for charity" . It's a great idea, and I really wish I could join her. But I'm not able to plan that long ahead. Maybe if I get the time I'll join her...those who watch will see. Anyways, the idea I got was this; maybe I'll try beating her  urlLink 24 hour blog ? Maybe I'll do a 24 hour-and-as-many-more-hours-I-can-make blog? It's a pice of cake to do really. I'm after all a nocturnal creature by nature so that shouldn't be to hard......or? Well FryKitty, waddaya say? Ye wanna take on the challenge?! *trying to look as though as possible*  Well, what else is new? Well, I've got some sad news. I didn't manage to to hold my promise to update this blog on a daily basis :(  I didn't write anything this weekend! But what the hell, it doesn't seem to be that many people who actually reads this site anyways. And why? Is it boring? Is it unkown to mankind? Or am I a sad fucker that just writes shit that nobody finds interesting? It has to be something!! I have  urlLink traffic , I know that. It ain't much but it's there. But why doesn't anyone sign the  urlLink Guestbook  before they leave? It's not that much to ask. Just write me a couple of lines, it's the thought that counts ya know :) I've changed the link to it so it's more obvius where to click, but no....it didn't help! I know I'm desperate for attension (spelled right?) but can u blame me? It's nice to know if the folks who visit this site actually like it. So c'mon folks,  urlLink drop me a line will  ya.  God! Why is it that every time I open my lunchbox I get bummed? I mean, I'm the one making my lunch so why the hell can't I learn to make something more exiting than a boring bread-meat-bread sandwich? This is getting old mister! *hitting my forehead* Btw, lunch is the wrong word to use as I'm on the late-shift this week.  Okay, now that I'm done eating I probably should get back to work. I got a list of phonenumbers to register, wich (spelled right?) is okay by me normaly, but this list...DAMN! I need a phreakin' magnifyerglass or something like that. I hate this itty-bitty type, it looks like a bunch of ants have been walking in ink and then marched across the damn paper... Oh well, gotta go now. I'll be seeing y'all later!   small addon:  I almost forgott to tell ya, I watched two movies this weekend.   T he first one was  urlLink "A Bugs Life"  made by  urlLink Pixar Studios , and I got only one thing to say. Damn! Animated movies r0xs! And specially the ones made by  urlLink Pixar . If ye don't know what else they've made, plz let me refresh yer memory; Toy Story  urlLink 1  &  urlLink 2  and of course "A Bugs Life". All made by Pixar and Disney. Pixar have also made quite a lot of good short movies (animated they to). I'm currently looking for'em on DivX so if any of u have some of them,  urlLink e-mail me will ya.   T he second movie was  urlLink "Sling Blade" . And all I can say is that it's  Briliant!  So get of yer ass and go rent'em will ya :)  Now I gotta run home, my girl called and said she was sick, she said she had 38,8 degrees fever (what's the code for the degrees symbol anyways?). Poor thing...

						   Okay, so here I am again. Trying to give ye something to read. I've been looking at a lot of other blog sites lately and I just gotta say this; Damn! I wish I could be that good. But I'm not, so I'll just have to keep this lousy layout :(  But I really hope that I someday get to realize my dream, and that is getting a webdesigner certificat! It's my one and only dream (well, actually I have others but their "in the making" so to speak ;o) and I just wish that someday I'll get it done. Imagine being payed to use yer imagination. What a blast that has to be!  I'm all full of ideas, thoughts and shit I'd like to make, but I lack the skills. So they just fade away into oblivion, until next time I get triggered. And that's  no  fun, no fun at all...  Maybe I'll give ye a few hint so y'all will get the idea: § 1:  urlLink MizDos and her daily rants  § 2:  urlLink Wallflower.nu  § 3:  urlLink Bratta.com - dhtml and other things   [not a blogsite]  § 4:  urlLink Crash.neotope.com - bringing you the best of nothing since 1999  § 5:  urlLink Blogger.com   [here ye can find a lot of good blogs with nice layouts]   So know ye understad, maybe y'all wanna pitch in? *lol* No? Figured so :p  Other than that, not much have happend lately. Still planning my wedding, getting ends to meet, planning a holliday (and it will be Bloggerised! ;o). Speaking of hollidays, it just popped into my head that I havent seen my folks in six months! Haven't seen my buddies in that long a time either. Gonna have a lot of catching up to do, oh yeah baby! It's going to be so much fun to see the freaks again, I'm jumping around just thinking about it :D And it's only two weeks from tomorrow! Yipes! Maybe it's time to fix me some airline tickets? U would think so right? *lol*  Now I'm all out of shit to write. But hey, this has to my longest one yet. And it even makes sense *lol* I'm gonna go now, but y'all come back now y' hear :)

						    Oh, the shame, the agony, the humiliation!   I didn't post yesterday, for the first time since I started this thing I didn't post  anything ! But I guess a time of wasn't so bad, besides my girl came back yesterday so I had other thing on my mind than posting ;o) And now I'm at work, while my girl's at home recoperating (spelled right?) from the vacation *lol*. As for me, I'm training a couple of newbies at work right now. Kinda cool that I'm the experienced one now, and I'm the fella they ask for advice. I  like it!  *lol*. But gotta go back to work now. Can't think of anything useful to say anyways so...  -cYa

						    My baby's comin' home! Yay!   Tomorrow is the day. My girl's coming home with the train. I'm really lookin' forward to it. 5 days if enough! I hate it. It's okay the first two days, but after that....bleh! The nights are the worst, I really don't like that empty bed. Not a tad bit. Being a Gras-Widower is okay for a day or two, maybe a weekend, but no more than that. But enough whining...  Over to another thing. I've been listening to some preeeetty good music lately. And wanted to make sure ye heard at least two of the goddies.   #1  is Revolving Doors with CrazyTown.  It's weird, has a strange rythm that kinda gets under yer skin. Listen to it by getting it  urlLink Here!    #2  is a song from Basement Jaxx' latest album "Rooty". I dunno the name of the song (just haven't bothered checking yet), but I know it's track 11 on the cd. If anyone know the tracklist, or have the covers on digital, please  urlLink e-mail me . The song itself is the best song I've heard in ages. It's imposible for me to sit still when it plays. So I'm pretty sure the people passing my window have been giving serious thought about calling some goverment branch *lol* Anyways, get it  urlLink Here!   That's all for now folks, but remember; If ye like the songs. By the Album! ...and we all know that pirachy is baaaaad :p

						   I promised my self that I was going to update this Blog atleast once a day, so therefor I've just popped by to say this;  1: I hate winME! Thank God that I get win2000pro tomorrow....imagine, no programs running exept winamp and the fucker tells me I don't have enough memory to execute Notepad! I mean...what gives, eh? I admidt, 64MB of ram aint that much but it should be enough for the fucking notepad to start!  2: just wanted to say Good night to y'all. Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite :)  ...oh yeah, here's some words of wisdom I just came up with (and yes,  I  invented that one!!!); "Water's wet, sky is blue. Women have secrets, what else is new?"  aint I something eh? :p  -cYa

						    Aaargghh!!   Damn, I gotta catch some shuteye! It may be a tad bit late/early to jump into bed, but I think that if I do it now I just might fall asleep. Or rather pass out...... Can ye blame me? It's 08:20 in the God damn morning!!  Good Night!......I hope.....  PS: I'm unplugging the phone, just thought ye oughta know (spelled right?).

						    "Sleepless in Seattle"   Yup, it's now 06:30 in the morning and the one thing I really didn't want, just came through. I'm sleepless! I've been tossing and turning for several hours now! But I've desided that if I really aint gonna get no sleep tonight I might as well do the out of it. So I've made my self a little snack and I'm now gonna browse through my DivX collection to see if there's something worth watching.  But just one thing before I do that, BM dearest....it's not yer fault that I'm sleepless. I've been feeling kinda weird all day so don't feel bad, okay? Enjoy yer stay in Halden and kiss yer "niese" from me  [din't remember the english word for it] . *Yawn* Maybe if this leftover pizza gets my tummy back on normal track I'm abel to get some sleep later on :)  PS: Tnx mom and dad for giving me that tower for my birthday. It worked out fine. Although the webcam still aint workin', and it's pizzing me off!   urlLink Blackfire : the links are all working! Maybe it's yer browser?  But that's all for now, a tired hug from da man of the day....ME :p

						    "Still the man!"   Yup, I just saw Shaft again. Now that's a guy who's made an artform out of being cool, cool as ice! He fuckin' rocks man! He's the coolest niggah I've ever had the pleasure of seeing on the silver screen (well, actually on my computer screen this time ;o).  But enough said about him. Let's talk about someone even cooler shall we? Yup, I'm reffering to moi. As ya all probably know, my girl is away for the weekend. And damn man, it's empty without her!! It's okay during the day, cuz I've got stuff to do and such, but when the night comes *sigh* I never thought I'd miss the talkin' and kicking that she tends to do in bed  that  much! I've gotten so used to hearing her breath at night, hearing her talking to someone/something in her sleep that I'm worried I aint gonna get any sleep tonight. I do hope I do though, cuz I'm going downtown tomorrow to try out some outfits for my wedding.Yay! Gonna be fun!  But now I gotta catch some shuteye, I'll see y'all tomorrow. Naughty night to y'all!  PS: if ye get the chance, listen to Basement Jaxx' album "Rooty". It rocks!!!!!!  *dancing away...*  Britt Marie, I miss u already!! I'm yours 4 ever and ever and ye best get used to it ;o) *blow ye kisses bye-bye*

						   So, here I am again. I actually got a respons on my page yesterday. Weeheee, someone actually signed the guestbook and said she liked my site/picture/whatever (I'm not picky...)! *extremly proud* Here is what she said, for those of u who doesn't wanna waste any time in  urlLink daGB  for whatever reason (I hate y'all 4 that btw...)    name  caro  Homepage   urlLink http://www.envy.nu/kaspara   How did you end up here?  fra gjæsteboka  Freak of nature?  yep  Sent  21.22 - wed 6 jun 2001 hei dær :)  takk førr det lange innlægge i gjæsteboka mi. allti hyggeli me tellbakemelding.  æ vil se på bilda hær nu, dæffør så orke æ ikkje å skrive så meget. førræstn så skriv æ ikkje på trøndersk, men på harstadsk og litt carrønt ;)  bilde av dæ va førræstn fint. du ser litt nick cavelig ut sælv om du ikkje ligne på han.  have fun go mad.    [for those of u who doesn't know norwegian she said something like; tnx for signing my guestbook...jada jada jada...btw, u have a kinda nick caveish look in yer pick. and u're kinda sexy too....]  Now that's a nice thing to say, right? I'm very proud now...hehe. Okay, so I'm a sucker for attension (  So, over to something different. I actually had something to write when I signed into Blogger.com but I've seem to have lost that thought....as usual! I really wounder what it was. But what the hell, who cares. By the way, I read that  urlLink this fella  here is very proud that I have used his layout for this site. But bare in mind that I have modified and upgraded it quite much *lol* But anyhow, visit his site and have a look. He writes very well, and I usualy checks  urlLink his page  for updates every day. Fun to read I think. So  urlLink Click Here  and give it a try!  *phew*  Now I really wish that Blogger.com could add a  target="_blank"  tag in the "insert link" thingy they have here. It's something every "add link" thingy should have on auto. It's a human right!!...eeerhhh...ahem...yeah! Got a bit carried away there :p  And what else is new? My inlaws have been here all week. Kinda fun actually. I was a bit conserned (misspelled?) that it would be to crowded for my part after a while, but hasn't been that at all. But their leaving tomorrow, and their takin' my girl with them! Argh! She's to go with them on a visit to my brother-in-law for the weekend. Actually, she will be gone till tuesday *sigh* But I'll survive. Gonna go try out some weddin' outfits on saturday, and after that I'll be going to  urlLink Komplett Data  to get my new tower and powersupply  [read older entries to find out why] . So I'll probably be quite bizzi this weekend after all. Gonna see if the power was the source of my webcam problems, so if that was it y'all will be seeing  urlLink me on cam  before ya know it! Just a warning to y'all :p  But now I gotta finnish those papers my boss gave me or it will be  urlLink hell  to pay *lol*  Actually I've allready done 2 and 2/3 of the 3 she gave me so I'm home free :p (gonna finnish'em now)  - cYa!

						    Funny  isn't it, here I am just browsing around the net. Not looking for anything in particular, but then I get to see  urlLink this!!  And as  urlLink this person  said it, "Buy me a RioVolt. Now. Please?". It's the darnest thing I've ever seen. So smooth lookin', so many cool features. I want one!! NOW!! Pretty Please?...  Funny how much cool stuff one can find just by following links from  urlLink one page  to  urlLink another . I often find myself browsing trough  urlLink links  from many of the  urlLink personal   urlLink web pages  I've  urlLink bookmarked  rather that  urlLink searching  for something out on the web. Much more  urlLink fun  that way I think. One can also stumble arcross some goodies along the way ya know :p But now I think I've babbled enough for now. Enjoy all the links I've given ya and please come back for more later will ya.  Now y'all come back now y' hear!  PS: please, for the love of  urlLink God , sign the  urlLink guestbook  will ya. It ain't that hard dammit!

						    Gimme speed, gimme fire....   Well, well, well.....just after I read  urlLink this fellow bloggers  complains about Blogger.com draging it's ass around I decided to write a little mail to'em just to give'em a pice of my mind. But waddaya know....they must be clearvoyant or something cuz now it's fast as hell. And damn good I say, cuz I was about to enwoke mayhem *big evil grin* (ps: feel free to  urlLink tip  me about my spelling ;o)  But let's talk a bit nerdy shall we. I just discovered something today. I'm an  idiot  when it comes to the inside of my computer, yes really I am. I know it may be hard to comprehend that I, your leader, your big badass pimpdaddy king of all trades him self actually  doesn't  know it all. But hey, that's life. I'm still da man though.... But anyways, back to the task at hand. Yes, I'm stupid when it comes to hardware and I really got it  [don't know right word]  today. I was bored and figured out that I should have a look at this webcam problem I've had. So I looked around and finaly I called up  urlLink Siemens  and asked for the specs on my computer (it was easier than opening the darn thing okay!). And waddaya know, I might have overlooked the most important thing of all....the powersupply! I'll show ya my specs so y'all will understand (the might be some errors cuz siemens aint that well documented):     Probabel Powersupply and motherboard size/Chassi: 110W MICRO-ATX   CPU: Pentium III 450MHz /m 512 KB Cache  HardDrive: 8.4 GB ATA-33  Memory: SDRAM 64 MB(probably PC100)  40X CDROM  Soundcard: CRLAB(Creative Labs?) ES1371  Motherboard: FIC VB601  and a TNT2 Pro 4xAGP 32MB graphicscard + 10MB network card, then try to add a USB webcam without any external powersupply :p *lol*    So now u understand my suprise eh? *lol* Gonna purcase a new tower and powersupply first thing when I get my money from the filmsale I just did. I'm buying this  urlLink tower  from Komplett Data, guess that will have to do for now. So maybe all my troubles will fade away eh? Time will show as they say...  But now I gotta get some work done her, ya know how it is. I'll be seeing ya...

						   Dear diary...  Today has been a fine day, we (read: sleepy old me ;o) got up around 10:45 and was in a particulary good mood. Exept the pain I felt in my tummy, wich by the way was caused by the fact that I haden't gone pee-pee in far to long a time (funny how long it takes before u realize that u actualy can do something with it when u're sleepy). So when that little problem was taken care of (and the man who said sex is the best there is, have  never  been extremly in need of a pee-pee!) it was breakfast time. And after that we did nothin' special before we went out for dinner and a little-drive around. I showed the inlaws my workplace, and we went for a visit in Old-Bergen (Gamle Bergen) where we looked at the old buildings and such. And now it's 23:22 and time for bed. Gotta work tomorow ya know. Earning my keep so to speak *lol*  Anyways....cYa PS: remember what we "talked" about?  urlLink So gimme some mails will ya :p

						   So, it's friday night and I'm as always up late. But who cares? Sleep is overestimated (spelling error?) as they say :p Been doing some more work here on my web these last few hours. I've added a archivelink on the bottom here, tried to get the link-to-this-post-thing to work but it seems to be something I'm overlooking *grrr*. What really anoyes me is that if Blogger wasn't so damn slow this would just have taken half the time! *dobble grr* But I've got all the time in the world......almost...  ...ops, I almost woke my girlfriend there. Gonna type a bit softer, try not to kill every key as I punch it maybe ;o) Don't wanna wake her up, she tends to get a bit cranky when that happends *lol*  Anyways, I still would like to get some input on the work that I do here, is that to much to ask for? All I want is a lousy  urlLink mail  now and then! So gimme some  urlLink  M A I L S   will ya! *sniffer* *whimper* *snoooort!!* ....but I'm not gonna let it get to me, really....*whimper*...  Yes, u really should be ashamed! *evil look*  But enough of that for now, I got another task for ya. Help me find a cool domain name. I'm gonna be a domaniac, but I need a cool domainname I can keep for a while without gettin' sick'n tired of it. Wanna help me out?  urlLink Mail me an sugestion now!   And that's all for this time, until next time my cheri......

						   Question; I signed up with  urlLink Sitemeter.com  yesterday, and fixed the counter so it would show my previous visiters to. And now when I checked it and compared it with  urlLink Extreme Tracking , which is the one I've used before, I found a differense in about 5-8 visits. Now what's that all about?! Which one is the best one? I chose Sitemeter cuz I've seen several bloggers use it, and it seemed like a good tool (multipel trackings, counter, the works). But is it? I want the most accurate one. Not that I have that much to keep track of, but none the less, I want just that.  urlLink Do you know which one is the best?  Maybe I should just be harsh and delete one of'em? That way I don't have this trouble...hehe

I just got one itsy-bitsy tiny thing to bitch about. Where the fuck did the black line around the blog go?!?! *pointing to the right* ---> I've tried everything, but it just woun't come back.....

						    I'll be rich!...     urlLink TheSpark.com's Wealth Test!   Congratulations! Based on inflation, taxes, the anticipated world economy, melting icecaps, free love, the global yeast war of 2017, the Canadian depression of 2021, and your personal financial outlook, you can expect to be worth one million dollars at...   47 years old!   This is how you'll make (or lose) big bucks during your very eventful life. Match these events on your personal timeline with the graph to see their effects.  2004: Your single "Rooty-Tooty-Booty (freak remix)" goes platinum.  2007: You take donkeys.com public. The value of "the home page for miniature and small standard donkeys" triples in one day.  2012: You sell your body to science, and it turns out they can actually use a little of it.  2015: Investing in Internuts, purveyors of on-line balls, proves disastrous.  "Hi, I'm Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, noted crap-monger, and star of TV's Melrose Place. I'm also a psychic. Anyway... I predict that your first million dollars will be made in 2023, in the following ways: "  $186,000 begging in the streets. $184,000 through insider trading. $182,000 being a star. $180,000 through lucrative nerd-ism, like me, Bill Gates. $114,000 working 9 to 5. $154,000 hunting/gathering.  Of the 2,313,729 people who've taken the WealthTest:   38% have shoplifted without getting caught 41% sign their name with an initial 40% have profited from the misery of mankind 20% have burned, torched, flamed, or ignited currency 2% wear pasties to work 19% scratch 'n sniff themselves  and 595991 have moms who fart  WealthTest takers last year made an average of $21,694.

						   Yipes!  Although the blogathon didn't go as expected (my ISP went down...again!), it wasn't a total loss. I've had my all-time-high in visitors cuz of the 'thon ring :) In one day (29 Jul, Sun, 2001) I got 135 unique visitors, that's more than I've ever had. Which then proves how poor my site really is :\  And I got an site rewiew from jessica at  urlLink jess.pika-grrl.net  Weheeee! I'm happy :)     Site Owner : Jigsaw  Site URL : http://dacrib.rexta.net   First Impression : 18/20  Layout : 18/20  Graphics : 20/20  Content : 10/20  Last Impression : 18/20   Total Score : 84/100   Comments : I really like Jig's splash page. The only thing a little weird is when you look at it in 800 res, but other than that it's really nice. The layout is good. Staying with the times and what's popular, but putting your own bit of style into it as well. The links on the top to the rest of the site, the mouse overs... I'm not sure if the colors can be changed or not, but if they can I think they should be changed to be with the layout colors. And I don't think they need to be with every link on the site. For the graphics that are on the site, I think they're really nice. Not over powering. There's not really a lot of content, it's mainly just a journal, pictures, and links, but the journal is interesting, which is a very good thing. Overall, it's a good site for reading.   The Final Words : Decent work.   What It Means :   First Impression : When your site first loads, so I hafta wait for 10 graphics to load or does it all just pop up on the screen. By just scrolling on the first page is it phsyically appealing to my eyes enough that it makes me want to read more things on the site. or does it make me just want to leave before I waste my time. Does it look good on both 800 and 1024 resolution?  Layout : Does your layout suit your content? Meaning do you have 20 links on your first page that could be condensed down into catagories because the linked site is small in content? Or do you have a condensed link format, but your contact infomation only has your email address.  Graphics : How long to they take to load? Do they look like you found them on lycos's multimedia search and just slapped them up on your site? Or did you spend time formatting them to go with your layout.  Content : Is your content about you or is it about the sites you visit and just has a journal? Would I be able to IM you and tell you I'm sorry for the crappy day you had?   Last Impression : Do I want to bookmark your site to come back again? Or link you? Do I feel like signing your guestbook or writing you an email to tell you how I feel about your site?    And she also said something I completly agree on!  "PLEASE tag the tagboard or the guestbook or SOMETHING to let me know you've been here, alright? People have gotten out of the habit of signing guestbooks and I think it's a habit that we need to get back into...."   It's a good habit, and it's much needed. In case you didn't know it, we webmasters are folks  dying  for attension (or maybe it's just me?).   Oh yeah, almost forgot. My good buddy  urlLink Digiboy  has jumped on the bandwagon and started his own blog.  urlLink Go get some!

						   Well, I'm now planning what to do in the 'thon and I've come up with a couple of ideas now;   #1:  I'll give out my cellphone number in each post so that anyone who want's to can call me and say hello and whatnot. Then I'll make a little note about it the next post. (ps: first caller get's the note :)   #2:  I'll do an interview/quiz-thing with one 'thon-blogger each hour. They'll get a quiz/interview-form by mail (I think, or maybe a chat-lesson) and I'll edit it down and post it. Nothing much, just to get some action in the 'thon (not that it needed it :). Dunno how funny it will be though, I'm having trouble finding the right questions.  urlLink Help?    #3:  I might be taking pictures with a digital cam. Maybe of me? Maybe of something else. Time will show...  Now I know this ain't much compared to the stripping, gravyard shift, musicwritings and what-not, but it's just for fun :)  - tatta for now

						    urlLink I couldn't agreed more.  Me, I'm sad cuz I didn't take backups of previous versions of my site. I've probably lost 3 or 4 versions due to the damn [Delete] button and various hd-crashes, format c: etc etc. I've also lost quite a few megs of irc-logs. I started chatting for real when I went to  urlLink IT-Akademiet  in Trondheim, and back then I didn't think about taking care of those little pices of history. But now I've learned, I always have a backup of those things, my webpages (previous versions too), my irc-logs and other things like pictures, funny writings etc.  The only worry I have now is storage, and by that I mean that it's gonna be a big chunk in a few years....maybe to big :)  Btw, I'm now fitt as a fiddle again.

						   First,  urlLink this is a nice looking newbie blog . Second, as I told  urlLink andrew hoshq  by mail just now. There's  no  meta-tags in the templates what so ever. At least I din't find any. So if there where any, they're hidden pretty damn good! But a link to the original designer is common curtesy on my behalf so I made one at the bottom of the page anyways :) So honey (it's her nickname stupid! :), andrew was wrong, don't wory about it. But keep up the good work, and soon you'll be blogging every day like me. "You just can't get enough..." *singing that old tune*

						      Hi, I'm back :) Not fitt as a fidle, but I'm here anyways... Today is the 23rd and I'm now officially out of the  urlLink blogathon . "Why?", you might ask. Well I'll tell you why! Cuz you didn't sponsor me! It's all you're fault! *sob* I had to have at  urlLink least 3 sponsors  by today, and not  one  signed up.... I wish y'all some sleepless nights, having nightmares and waking up screaming cuz of quilt! That'll teach you  not  helping the good cause. (you know I'm just kidding right?...well, almost anyways ;)  On the other dang, I've aquired the movie  urlLink "Gone in 60 seconds"  on DivX yesterday. It's a  grrrrrreat  movie, and the quality is awsome (perfectly ripped by  urlLink Digiboy )! Gonna watch is someday soon, maybe tonight. I'm not feeling that good so a quiet evening is prefered. But I've promised to help some friends move into a new flat...hmmm. We'll just see what my body tells me later today. But enough whining from me know, don't want you to think I'm a crybaby *lol*  Me and my girl are still planning our wedding. It's coming along nicely. Although I must admit I'm getting a itsybitsy stressed out now, it's only 2 months left! But we'll make it, you betcha!  Hmmm, this spellchecker that  urlLink blogger  has here doesn't seem to work, oh well. Like I care...  And now for some HTML chitchat :) I've tried to make a good page, designwise that is, for a long time. But I give up. I'm just not good enough, so I'll bite the bullet and try to use the few skills I have customizing templates instead. I know it's a sellout, but I've had it! I want a cool page. A page that I like the layout on, and since I suck at developing'em my self, I'll just use templates and modify them to my needs. So keep watching this page now, you'll see some major changes soon.  But now I gotta stop this mindless babble so.....

						   Oh, it's been a while now hasn't it? Yes it has. I've been kinda ocupied lately. Trying to get a new design working for this here blog. Haven't made it work yet, as you might have guessed ;) It will be  very  cool once I get it right, but untill then you'll just have to survive with this one. What else have happend lately? Oh yeah, I donno why, how or when it happend but all of a sudden I found the webcomic  urlLink "User Friendly"  by that guy Illiad darn funny. I got hoocked you might say, so I've been reading it for the past few days and yesterday I got upto date! So I have now read every strip ever made with those thechs :)  I would have written more, but I'm not feeling up to it right now. I'm kinda sick....got the flu or something like it. Oh well, bye bye for now :)

Poor  urlLink Blogger  lost with a dog's hair. And stupid  urlLink livejournal.com  was the "People's Voice Winner", now what's that all about, eh? I've looked at  urlLink LiveJournal  and it sucks, bigtime! Well, maybe not  that  much. But I still like  urlLink Blogger  a hell-of-a-lot more.

No catch, no hassle. It's all based on a honor system so you're not committing to anything other than your own consciences :)  I'm doing the  urlLink Blogathon  for the  urlLink The Norwegian Cancer Society  cuz I've had some hand on experience with that. And they deserve all the help they can get. So plz, go on and click the button. I'm gonna love you for it! And  urlLink mail me  afterwards, so I'll now you're sponsoring me :)

						   Wow, remind me  not  to do what I did yesterday again....  A buddy of mine,  urlLink Digiboy , sent me an sms around 22:00 last night. He told me to come to Zachen (a pub in Bergen) to meet him and some other folks we know from irc (#Lek). I remembered he'd said something about it earlier that evening so I thought why not. I'll just pop down and have a few smokes and maybe a beer or a little something-something.   Bad idea!   What was supposed to be a  short  trip downtown after work, resulted in me coming home drunk as a kite at 06:30 in the Goddamn morning...  I finished up at work around 23:30 and tok the bus downtown. There I met  urlLink Digiboy , meee and Mirax. We had a few beers (at least they did, I'm no fan of beers), danced, and danced some more. After a while I was so dried out that I snatched Digiboy's beer while he danced, and that was it. Then I got another beer....and I was sold. After Zachen closed up, we left for a nachspiel at Digi's. We picked up a few friends, Peewee (also from #Lek), and another dude and his girl. Dunno who they was, I had never seen'em before. But he was a irc-geek to so they fitted right in *lol* So we ended up at Digi's where we drank and did shit til early morning. At 05:45 or something I went home, after helping Digiboy washing the dishes and such. All in all a perfect, but  not  planned, evening.  So what's the downside you migth ask. Well, lack of sleep for one thing, thirsty as hell (but not hungover, thank God) and that my friends, makes for a not so fun nightshift tonight :(

						   Hmm, I'm posting as a madman here tonight. Maybe it's because I'm soooooo bored? Anyways, just wanted to tell you  before  you asked; Yes, the respond-link is gone. It was never in use so what the hell was the point? Besides, I think it looks smoother this way than before, don't you agree? And I'm trying to get rid of this bad habit I have, namly writing slang/hood english all the time ( or is ebonics english the right term? ). It was getting tiresom and used. And it was fucking up my normal english to. You know how it is when you get used to doing something one way. I'm having real trouble not using  "ye"  or  "ya"  instead of  "you" , or the even worse one  "u" . *shivers* But your not getting rid of the  *whatever emotion*  or the smileys :) A man gotta have  some  fun *lol*  Oh well, I gotta go now. Gonna finish up here and head home. Catch me some z's ya know ;)

						    Salut to y'all!  Well, this is my first update since...well....it's been a looong time. I'm kinda sick'n tired of my web these days. Trying to find something useful to do with it. Maybe a total makeover would do the trick? But enough about this html talk now.   I've been reading my old stuff and find that most of my chit-chat is pretty shallow. It hasn't become what I wanted it to be. I wanted to write a diary, not a weblog full of mostly BS. But I feel that I can't write a diary in the true sense of the word. That may offend, hurt or annoy some folks. Besides, I can understand that some folks (my girl for example) don't want their personal lifes on display. And that is what would happend if I started to write a true diary.  So...what to do? Well, when and if I should begin a true diary I would have to do it somewhere else, maybe purcase a domain and don't tell anyone, or make it a hidden diary (but then what's the point of having it on the web?), or plainly write it on my own computer for my eyes only. But I've never been the diarywriting kind before, so it's hard to try to be one now. I have a problem when it comes to writing down my thoughts, my deep thoughts that is. I can write on and on about a certan topic, but when it comes to writing my thoughts, or sum up a whole day.....I'm at a total loss. So what I'm gonna do is continue this weblog full of BS, but I'm gonna try to make the BS have a topic, or rather talk BS with a meaning :)  I'm full of BS so this is a good way of emptying the BS-tank so to speak. And I hope I can make it entertaining for you as well. So from now on it will be less updates (I think ;), but the updates will have some sort of contence....or try to at least. I'm not promising anything :)  And that ends the story for today kids, but before I go I'd like to ask you all one favor. I've found out that getting rezpons from my visitors is hard (getting visitor is even harder!). The respond link at the end of all my posts have NEVER been used (thus I removed it), the  urlLink guestbook  is in use maybe once every millenium, and not one person have ever answerd any of my questions in this weblog! Therefor I ask of you this, just send me a blank  urlLink e-mail . You don't have to write ANYTHING, just  urlLink mail me!  .....and if you can get me more visitors by linking me or whatever, feel free to do so ;)

						   Well, the jobinterwiew went quite well. I think/hope I have a good chance.  Right now we've been cleaning up a bit around the office/bedroom/livingroom (you see, we kinda use the bedroom for lotsah things ;). It was a battle for life, but it was wourth it.  My girlfriend is standing beside me now, she's trying on her weddingshoes. She's laughing cuz when she's wearing'em she's almost 6cm higher *lol*. That means she can almost kiss me without standing on her toes....hehe. Anyways, we had a bit of a cleaning day today. Cleaned out our closets, and damn! No wounder she had a shortage of storingroom! She got rid of 4 bags of old clothes she never wore. And I filled 2 bags. We gave them away to the Salvation Army so someone will be happy later on :) And I've filled out some applications for jobs today. We'll just have to wait and see. But over to some more internet related  urlLink schtuff.   I came over this  urlLink sweet thing  when browsing my  urlLink daily reads . I think it's übersweet 'n all that. Love knows no distance, and neither does it care. Love can defeat anything, just keep that in mind Stu and Lane. If you truly belive in that there's no telling what might happen! If I had the possibility I'd contribute, but alas. With my current posision in life that just ain't possible. But I'll give  urlLink you  lotsah good thoughts, is that enough? I'll even link you :D  But now it's good night and sweet bye-byes from me. I'm not going to bed, but I'm gonna make me a sandwitch and do a total relax-session with old X-files episodes and Futurama before I turn in. I think I deserve it, don't you agree? Yes, I knew you would. C Ya!  Oh, almost forgott. Here are some cool mp3 stations you can listen to if you're bored. You all know I got superbe musictaste so dig in!  urlLink WOLF FM - '70, '80 & Today   urlLink P O W E R S H O U T !   Simply the best...   urlLink SnakeNet Metal Radio   urlLink Radiostorm.com: POP TOP40   PS: you need  urlLink Winamp  to play them.

						   Okay, so...this has been the worst and most boring week ever! And it's just been three days! So you all know by now that I've lost my job. And I'm handling it pretty well...and  that  was sarcastic. But I'm not here to whine, not much anyway, but to tell you what's been going on these past days.  This have been the longest non-blogging days in my life. I've missed it, I really have. Not that I have the habit of writing to much personal stuff, but it happens once in a while. Like today.  I've lost my job, and I found out that my co-workers where full of shit (no, not you  urlLink Digiboy ). I was downtown talking to the woman I'm related to in Manpower (dunno what to call it in english so I'll get back to you on that) and she said that my co-workers had been complaining about me beeing to straight forward, maybe a bit pushy etc. They even had the nerve to complain about me being darkminded the day I got fired! Wtf!? What would you have been if you just got fired? With a lousy three day warning!?!!!  Fuck you!!  Now I could bitch about this for more that this but I've desided to put it behind me. But I thought you actually where my friends....this shows how much you can trust people don't it. What ever happend to telling someone something right to their face? That hurt folks, that really hurt me...  But over to something a little bit more sunny. My good buddy and childhood friend Ødegård dropped by the day before yesterday. Yay! We went to the cinema and watched  urlLink Jurasic Park III . Übercool! Much better then  urlLink the second one  and I would dare say almost up there with the first one. And then we went home and talked untill it was 2 o'clock in the morning.  urlLink Digiboy  also dropped by.  And yesterday I went to  urlLink Dataport  and handed them my CV. And I got an e-mail telling me that I got an interwiew for thursday the same day! Yay! I got a good feeling about this, but don't dare hope to much. Time will show.  Today I've been writing aplications and trying not to freak out. It ain't easy being without a job....   mp3 of the day: Linkin Park - One Step Closer - listen to the lyrics and you'll understand

						   Since I ain't getting anymore shifts after today, this is my last day at work. I'm kinda pist off that they can get away with that. But they can, since my contract is based on internship. So they just did a spanish one and said; no more shifts for you! (did you get the refference there?) Thus they can get away clean,  and  they don't have to pay me that last week of my contract. Bastards! I'm gonna tell them to kiss my ass when I leave today. Yes, I think I'll do just that. Or, maybe not. I don't know. I'm kinda sad. I'm gonna miss my co-workers. Don't know if they'll miss me though...hehe. I'm gonna miss the "pick on me, pick on you" fun we've had these eight months.  Oh well, life goes on. And I can't afford to be left behind. So I gave my CV to a buddy of mine and maybe, just maybe, I'll get a job real soon. Let's cross our fingers and other bodyparts for that, eh?  On another note, I'm having trouble with my computer now so if I don't post anything this weekend I'm not dead. Just pist off ;) I tried to install win2000 server yesterday, but I keep getting a blue screen when I install.  "Dumping system core...jadajadajada"  and other cryptic messages. And I can't install anything else either cuz I can't get into ms-dos. And it woun't boot into any other os I put in the cd-rom either. It kinda get's me woundering on what the hell I'm gonna do. So I'll be quite bizzi tonight.  But enough whining and rambling from me this time. I'll just go kick some "former boss" butt now ;)

So what happends is that I have to eat infront of the computer, hoping I don't get a call. What the hell else am I gonna do? I'm hungry dammit!

						   Okay, tho those of you who's actualy expressed concern about me, I'm doing fine now. Still gonna be out of a job in two weeks, but after talking to my girlfriend I now know I'm no fuckup. Or I'm trying to think that anyways. I've been unlucky with my past jobs thats all. Maybe this is what I need? I've been kinda tired from this job the last few months anyways. It's not my dream job so to speak. And I was, to be quite frankly, lead to belive it was a tad more "computerish" than it has been. Not that I haven't enjoyed my time here, I really have. I have been so fortunate to work with some very cool people here and I'm a bit sad that I have to leave them now. But as they say, life goes on...  I'm gonna hand in my resyme to a neighbor that said he could get me a job in IT. I hope I can, I don't wanna go without a job to long. I can't afford it! And besides, I have better chances getting a new job this time as I have more experience now (i had zero workhours last time i was looking for a job). So. Don't worry folks, I'm a surviver ;)  Over to some other bussines (if you've bothered to read this far), I've opened the  urlLink Top 10 blog  I've made. And I currently have  one  active player. Weehee! Go have a look.  But now I'll have to stop this rambling, I'll be seeing you.

						    I'm done, dead, a mishap'...   That's it, I'm now a proven mishap' I just got sacked from work. They call it "not re-newing the contract". But I say call a bastard by it's real name if you're gonna call it something! And that name is "the pink slip", "the boot", in short terms; "sacked". That means I'm dead in the water. With bills coming up, a wedding to pay, and a grilfriend to take care of. How the hell am I gonna make this work?! What's wrong with me? I've been here eight months now, and  now  they tell me they're not that happy with my work? They said I was slacking...well, okay. Maybe I was, how the hell should I know if they don't tell me? I'm fresh out of school. I have never worked before in my life, and they expect me to  not  need some guidense?  Okay, maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just that lazy, no good fuckup as the trend seems to say I am. I don't know, I only know this; I'M FUCKED! We're fucked, my life is fucked....I hate my self right now. I really, really hate myself. God, what shall I tell my girlfriend? This is  not  something she needs now, not now that she's starting school again. Man, I really fucked up this time. I hate life, and life seems to hate me.  Bye.....

						   Okay, why is it that every time I'm at work I get the cravings for a smoke?! I quit smoking almost six months ago but when I'm at work I tend to have a smoke or two (or three...). I really wanna quit all together! When I'm at home I never get these cravings, well, almost never. If my buddy Digiboy's there, or any other smoker, I get them. If I'm not around smokers I have no problem what so ever, but as soo as I get around them I feel a little craving comming on. I tend to smoke when I'm out having a good time at the pub or other places. But nothing makes me wanna smoke more then when I'm at work. Maybe it's because all my co-workers smoke. I dunno, but at least I don't go around craving them all the time. But alas, I really want to quit all together. With the exeption of when I'm partying if course ;) Thank God my girlfriend shares  that  opinion (don't get that one wrong, okay?). If I couldn't smoke when I'm drinking I would go insane....hehe But I have to admidt that when it's sunny and warm outside, and I'm walking downtown I really miss that little smoke....why is all the good things in life bad for you?! Not to mention expensive!  Oh well, as long as I don't start all over I probably should be happy. But I'm walking the thin red line.......and I'm damn good at it :)

						   So, just got of the phone with my sister. They're just 31 miles away now. Over halfway there. Gonna be übercool to have them here. I feel so grown up all of a sudden ;) When I get home now I'll have to watch a movie or something just to keep me from walking up the walls! Maybe I'll watch  urlLink Disney's Dinosaur , been wanting to do that for a long time now. I saw it at the movies but once ain't enough :)  But I'll have to run now. It's only 5 minutes till my bus gets here. But before I go I have a couple of things to say; 1) Go watch the  urlLink groupblog!  2) It's only  46 freakin' days  till my Wedding!!! Yay for me!

						   Damn! It's raining like hell out here. It's raining upwards, downwards, forward and backwards. Generaly it's raining in all directions at the same time. And the drops are big as baseballs! So using an  urlLink umbrella  ain't much use :\ And did I mention the thunder? Oh yeah! Thunder like you've never seen or heard before. It's like a continious thunderroll. Pretty cool actualy, if you disregard the fact that I have to sit inside infront of a computer with a telephone headset on. Just waiting for the lightening that will strike down in the phoneline central, frying all the lines, thus making my head look like a fried chicken.  So if you don't hear from me after today, be worried. Be very worried...

						   15 minutes to go. Damn, I'm dead tired. Who would have thought a day at work could feel so long? Oh well, going home now in just over 13 minutes.  I'm looking forward to this weekend. My parents and my little sister are coming. My sister is going to school here, so they're just dropping her of. And doing a little housecall at the same time :) They'll be staying from Friday till Monday. Gonna be darn fun having them around again, even if it is just for a short while (or maybe a weekend is just longe enough, eh? :). We're going to like do schtuff together and such...Yay!  Oh well, I'm off now. My girlfriend is picking me up today. Hooray! Haven't seen her in, oh let me see, 5 days!   Damn, no wounder I'm going a bit crazy now...

						    urlLink borgle.com    Mind over matter. Do you mind? What's the matter? Nevermind.   The fella who made the oroginal template for this site. Not much left of it though. I've been fixing and fiddling with it for quite some time now. The reason for this link? Well, nothing really. I was just browsing away and I liked the  "mind over matter"  thing so I just pushed "Blog This!"

Well, it's nice that you changed you mind and decided that the 'net actualy evolves around me :) As for  urlLink Digiboy , well....he can get the crumbs. But as to you getting to be the chat princess, well, it's okay by me. But you'll have to be aware that you're talking to the two biggest irc bastards in existense :D And one of us is actually @ (operator) in one of the most popular servers in Norway (not that that is such a big thing...)   "Now I've done it properly, is there a chance that we can make friends?!"   Why, of course. I haven't had this much fun in ages. This certanly brought back some of the original fun in blogging *lol* But, remember, I'm the guy who rocks your world! So say it loud and say it proud; "the Jigzaw rocks my boat!" :D

						   *Yawn, Yawn and quadruple Yawn*  I'm dead tired right now. Dunno why, I wasn't up late last night. Maybe I'm just worn out. I just know one thing, I'm going to bed early tonight. And I feel a cold comming on to, got this ichy feeling in my troath. Bah! I hate this "feeling a illness coming" thing. I wanna stay well dammit! Oh well, I'll just have to take it like a man....cuz that's what I am, right? It was the last time I looked anyways so let's stick with that. And my baby's coming home today so I'll definitly survive ;)  Over to the whole "I am the center of the universe and all that's in it" theme.  urlLink Wadday mean you're the center of the universe?!  Where did you get that stupid idea? And  urlLink Molly , did I say you could have anything else but Sundays? No, I didn't!  It's as simple as this; I rock! I rule the world and all around it! I am the center of  everything , and you should all worship me! So give prais to the Man of the Millenium, the Jigzaw! Cuz he truly, deeply and profoundly rocks your world!   "We will, we will rock you! We will, we will rock you!"  *sing baby, sing!*

						   A couple of updates here; [1] Added an  urlLink imood  thingy to the  "Things of Note" . (okay, this is both stupid and childish...but then again, it's me ;) [2] Added a  urlLink rate thingy  in the same area. [3] Gave you the choise between having links opening in the same window or a new one. It's the checkbox on top of the navigation side (the left side stupid!)  ...oh, and the  "Blogs of Note"  have become the  "Things of Note" . But if you're a frequent visiter you probably already saw that, right?!

Nobody is better than me, I'm the center of the 'net dammit! How can anyone beat that? The reason I'm the center of the 'net is cuz I  am  the center of the 'net. Is that so hard to understand for a little brat?  And by the way,  urlLink who ever said anything about sharing?  And if so, you can have Sundays cuz I like to rest then. Okay? If not...well...deal with it. Feel lucky that you even got that one.

						   Hmmm, after some looking I find my self popping up at several searchengines on the phrase:  Lars Joachim . Now the fun part is that I haven't indexed my site anywhere what so ever!

Once you see how superior I am you'll be on you knees, begging me to make you my queen! It isn't easy beeing the center of the 'net but somebody have to be it. And who would be better than me? As they; it's a dirty job, but somebody has to do it.  Btw, nice that I could make you giggle. Although I can't see  what  I might have said that would give you that response. I'm just stating the facts...

Well, thank you. And I'd belive you if you hadn't written this in my guestbook first;  "I'm sorry, I'll rectify my omission at the earliest opportunity. If you admit that it revolves around ME ME ME ME ME!"    And since I'm not 'bout to bow down for a little brat who think she's the center of the electonic universe called the 'net (cuz that's  me! ;) I'll have to presume that there's a big chunk of sarcasm in the above statement. So back of my trone ye fool! Bow for the center, and  king , of the 'net! :)

But then again, since my girlfriend has gone home for the weekend it's kinda strange too. Oh well, I'll survive. My buddy  urlLink Digiboy's  gonna lend me 96 cds with  urlLink DivX  movies for me to watch :) And hopefully I'll get  urlLink winXP  too. And if all goes swell I'll get my birthdaypresent, 128 MB RAM, on monday...whoptidoo!  So maybe I'll get the cam working soon to, gonna be fun. But now I'm all out of shit to say so I'll just shut up now....

						   So, I'm at work and thinking that I might do some ranting inbetween the  "battles" .  This weekend have been fun, on Saturday everybody at work went out on a social  urlLink gathering  thing. We dined and vined @  urlLink Peppe's Pizza . I love it when the  urlLink Boss  picks up the tab for all the workers :D We all love  urlLink him  for that ;) We had a darn good time, drinking beers and eating pizza. My buddy  urlLink Digiboy  had maybe a few to many (see the post from that night).  Other than that nothing much have happend this weekend. Me and my girlfriend have been plaing some more wedding  urlLink schtuff . We're almost done now. Just have a few small ends to tie up and we're all set to go :)  Oh, and I finaly got to see  urlLink M:I 2  yesterday. Damn cool movie. I just love John Woo's movies! He's the best director ever (at least from my point of wiew).  Oh, one last thing. You know, the  "contact"  link is there to be used. So just knock your self out. I'm not gonna kill you ;)

Stupid Windows ME (yes I know, but it was strictly a  "in desperatly need of getting the computer up'n running"  thing, okay!). And now my IE is fucked up beyond rescue. I can't use any of the features in Blogger, I'm just happy I remembered the keyboard shortcuts :) And no  urlLink Jess , I'm not dependent on Blogger. I just haven't bothered doing it the hard way. I'm lazy you know ;) Oh well, now I gotta do the dishes before work. It's a dirty job but someone gotta do it...hehe  Btw, the Picture section is up'n running.

						   Ehy!  Just popped in to tell you that I'm still alive. Not that anybody have expressed any conserne though. I've just been bizzi. And besides, Blogger.com was "down" or something yesterday. I've been reading about CSS these last couple of days, and I think I'm getting it now. Gonna try it out today so if nothing seems to look as it used to (read: look damn ugly!) it's just me messing up my design with CSS *lol*.  On the other note, I wounder why  NONE  of my 30-40 visitors never seems to remember to sign the guestbook! Is it that much to ask? If you like it, say it dammit!  urlLink  read more bitching 'bout it in the bblog...    I got no more to say right now, but I'll be back *doing the Arnold thing*

						   So, what's new? Well, I've gotten the bblog (bitch 'bout it log) up'n running. Ain't much there yet, but just keep watch. The link is under the  "Internal places"  section. I've switched guestbook today.  urlLink Alxnet  isn't that good anymore. Much downtime, slow servers, errors all over the line. Bah! So I looked around after a good one and came across  urlLink Signmyguestbook.com  (tnx  urlLink Jish! ). They're great! You can't edit the entries (as you can in Alxnet), but you  can  customize the outlook of your guestbook as much as you like. There's nothing stoping you. And that's cool, big star in my book!  My buddy  urlLink Digiboy  is still trying to get  urlLink Wallflover's  attention, but alas. No luck yet. He's just not that big a mouth as he claims to be I guess....  Oh well. Compared to him, I'm a BIG sucess in the Blogger world *lol* And that's cool *evil grin*

						    Days left till wedding : 3  {getting a tad nervous, but not that much...yet}  So, first update from my future inlaws. Things are going swell. We've been out all day bying the last things. I've gotten my cigars ;^) and she's gotten her perfume and other thingemajigs. Her brother, my "soon-to-be-brother-inlaw", the rest of my family and other peeps are coming tomorrow. So things are comming together just fine. My best man and the rest of my old gang will be driving down on friday. I'm really starting to imagine the wedding now, and it makes me kinda nervous. And when I'm nervous I smoke, thus....I'm smoking again. But not much. Just now and then. But now we gotta do some more work before we call the night. I'll get mack to you later with more info.   A short note on the end; I think  urlLink Digiboy  should change his layout. Now that he's writing this much it gets hard to tell the posts apart. Insert a line or something at least. I'll have to make him a new layout when I get back, better that way...heeheeheeee.  ...bye bye for now my trusty peeps :^)

						   Okay, the day has arrived. We're leaving for our wedding today at 13:30. The date is set, the suit are picked up, the weddingdress also, the guests are on their way, we're all packed...it's all becoming so much clearer to me now.   I'M GETTING MARRIED!!!!   My freakin' God, I'm actually getting married. Who would have thought so, not me. Not that I, in the age of 22, would be married. I didn't even think I'd have a girl I loved at that age. Man, things changes fast don't they. But I'm lovin' every minute of it! :^)  But anyways, I'll try to update this site regulary from my inlaws' computer (inlaws, cool...hehe). But don't expect to much, many last minute things to do you know. And what do my eyes see? A  urlLink dorment blogger  has awaken, and he even has the nerve to ask me to send my few, but trusted, readers over to him? Get yer own fangroup sucker! Maybe write a little more, eh? ;^)  Oh well, of to pack the car. Wish me all luck folks.  urlLink I'd like some congrats e-mails :^)  or, if you dare (yes, I  dare  ya!!!), a call at my cell phone. The number are; 0047 (or +47) 900 42 648. Did ya get that? 900 42 648, my number here in Norway. Come, get some *evil grin* I'm serious, I'd love some calls. You can reach me there at all times, except after one o'clock on the 22nd.

So now you can all interact with my ranting if you'd like. Maybe a tad more than my guestbook,hmm? I only wish there where a way I could implement my own design in it. It's kinda ugly, don't you think?  But now I gotta run, I'm printing out some more weddingfolders (song, program etc), just had to let the printer cool of. It's old and overheating...hehe. So on with the program. cYa.

						   FUCK! Not again!! Stupid computer! I fucking hate this satanical machine!!! Everytime I write something long and meaningful it croaks on me! FUCK!!  Once more...  I've been reading about this bombing everywhere these past few days. I just heard that one of the bloggers over at  urlLink bleedingmonkey.com  past away in the attack at WTC. God bless her soul. I didn't know her, but it still makes me sad. It's strange, but somehow the blogging community feels like some sort of family. Even the ones I don't know. Makes me wounder if anyone else of my daily reads where there, I gotta check. But what I don't understand is why? What goes trough these peoples heads as they do stuff like this? Why can't they understand that none of us care about whatever they think is wrong? Why can't we all just get along? We are all the same on the inside, we all worship the same God (just in different forms and various types, he's all the same none the less). Why can't the people doing this understand this? Why?! I'm not sure I wanna give this world another child to corrupt, but I probably will. I'm to selfish...  I have only thing to say, bloggers of the world. Unite! Make the world listen to what the common man on the street has to say! Let them now that we condem their actions! PLEASE!! Please God, make them hear...please...  I'm begining to hate this world. I really do. It's become a place of hate and war, not much good stuff left it seems. If we didn't have love and faith we would have past on a long time ago. It's true what they say, mankind  is  selfdestructive.

I've decided to toss away that "paranoid by nature" thing and reveal my good and holy christian name to those reading this blog. It's a BIG step for me, but I've realized that I'm sick of "hiding" my name on the internet. Those who know me will know who it is, me or an imposter. So fuck it!    "Hi!

						    urlLink Blablablah...  I really don't care  what  you think. I'm keeping this layout as long as I wanna. Maybe if I by a fluke should get some better color ideas I'll change them....maybe. Anyways, thanks for all the hits. I've had my all-time-high today. And they're still rising...hehe.   Maybe I should tickle her funnybone more often?

						   Cheezes! I hate it when  urlLink somebody  calles you something you ain't. But I want to say that I'm sorry for some of the more childish remarks yesterday. It was late and I was tired okay. But to clear things up a bit, here's why I  don't  think this is a copycat-page; 1) Wallflower (or nattfall as she calles her self) has two frame-frames (i.e like pictureframes). One at the top, and one at the bottom. 2) She then has a frame on the left with the links, but her links are just normal tekstlinks. Not DHTML like mine. And the leftaligment are, in fact, the most normal way to do it. 3) She then has a mainpage on the right where she does her schtuff. With a very flat scrollbar. Not as mine, with the 3D effects.  But me, I have one topframe, and two sideframes. And a centered mainpage! And my scrollbar are way cooler, with the 3D and all :) Besides, her page is way better when it comes to the tables etc. She's better at that than me. As  urlLink Molly  said, it's different all together, 'sept for the colors. And if she really means that the colors are  all  hers, okay. I'll change them. But I'm keeping the yellowish one!  So if I'm a copycat, I'm doing a terrible job...

						   Okay, a little summary of my life these past few days.  1) Was asked to take in a little kitten for a couple of weeks for a friend of mine. Okay enough, but he neglected to mention that this is the stupidest kitten in the whole world! I mean, after being thrown down from the table/shelf/computer/whatever's-one-meter-above-ground about 600 times you'd think it learned its lesson? But no, not at all. I mean it's soooooooo cute and all, but it's driving us  nuts ! So I'm taking it back tomorrow. I don't care  how  cute it is. I'm not getting another animal until we get a bigger home. It's gotta go! It's us or it.  2) I might have dibs on a job soon. I'm quite optimistic about it. It's through a company called  urlLink Computer People . They hire out IT folks to various companys. And they're interested in me :D So cross every bodypart you can for me, and then some :)  3) It's only 2 friggin weeks till my wedding!!! Yay! I'm phsyced! The date is the 22nd of september, write it down boys and girls. I want as many congrats-mails as my mailbox can stand that day ;) But other tokens of love are more than welcome, just write for my accountnumber ;) And girls, sorry. This chap is officaly out of reach. Don't cry to much over me, you'll all get over it soon.....or at least before you die. I think, I dunno. I can't help it, my charm's just to big for me to handle *lol*  4) In norwegian:  urlLink Guestbook for daCrib:  Denne layouten er jo 99% MIN. Heh. Lær deg å lag dine egne sider. For all del. Camilla Henrikke Translation: This layout is 99% MINE. Heh. Learn to make your own pages. By all means.  Answer: Hey, lady! I only borrowed the colors. And only a few of'em. C'mon. You can't seriously think my look like yours. (but if you do, thank you ;)   update:  Norwegian: Denne siden hadde fine farger jo, men har jeg sett de før? Ehm! Ja?  Translation: This page had nice colors, but haven't I seen them before? Yes? Answer: As I said, I only took the colors. C'mon, think of it as a complement. If you use your brain  urlLink miss. wallflower  (that is, if you got one...hehe) you'll see that not ONE frame is the same as yours. And none of the other shit is either. Oki, there's a resembelens in the scrollbar, but only a little. Mine is way cooler ;) So back off shorty. As you would have said; Stikk, din genmodifiserte elg. Før du får en laks en viss plass ;) I 0wn ya butt baby!

						   Well  urlLink Molly , for starters the guestbooklink is fairly easy to remember (same as yours but with jigzaw instead ;). And maybe I should explain why I redesigned this page when it was so slick lookin' as it where. It's not that strange maybe: You see I got a lot of positive remarks about my design. And people said it was asswhoopin' good, but alas. It wasn't my own. The design was originaly made by Paul @  urlLink borgle.com . I only changed it a bit to my own liking. And added some new features etc. But it still wasn't my  own  design. But this is, and it's giving me a chance to learn more about tables, CSS etc etc. For the first time in  ages  I actually made a page from scratch. I've gotten the bad habit of just grabing a halfway desent design and using the code, cut'n paste ya know.... But no more! I'm finally doing it the way I want to, from the bottom up. And I'm damn proud! (besides, this design ain't  that  bad...)  So keep watching, cuz there's more to come!

						    WARNING: big-ass post below, proceed with eyes wide open!   It's been a long time now, so this is gonna be a big-ass update! Are you up for it? Sure? Okay, let's go!   The wedding...   As you might have seen the last post I had was three days before the wedding. And then I went all silent on you. Well, it was much to do those last three days. We had to get all the last things together. We had to decorate the house we had rented. We had to decorate the church, We had to practise and schtuff...etc, etc.   But finaly the day was there, and boy was I nervous!!  urlLink The curch  was perfect. The weather was  more  than perfect! The wedding started at 13:00 (one o'clock) on Saturday. As the musicman started playing the weddingmarch I couldn't stop smiling. Because there came  urlLink the most beautiful bride  I had  EVER  seen! I had to remind my self to breath more than once. She was so beautiful that the first thing I said to my best man when she entered the curch was;  "Oh my God, she's so beautiful!!"  I didn't even know I said it untill he told me after the wedding. But I think God will forgive me, don't you?...hehe. The priest was an unusualy cool priest, so the wedding went smooth and was kinda amusing at times :)  Then we drove of for the photosession. In a '58 Buick! Damn, that car was  fly! . Oh, here's a picture of  urlLink us kneeling for the blessing . Almost forgott to add that one.  After the photosession (you'll get to see those pictures later, when I get the time to scan'em...) we went to the house we rented for dinner and coffee. And a whole  urlLink lotsa   urlLink cake!  And a huge wedding cake, made by BM 2 's sister. Here are some pictures of that:  urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ,  urlLink 3 ,  urlLink 4 ,  urlLink 5 ,  urlLink 6 .  And the party went on for hours, long into the night. We had many fun games, i.e a  urlLink question game  where we had to answer on who did what in our relationship...very funny. Not to many answers where alike though...hehe. And a  urlLink weird play  where the people playing had to have  urlLink matches in their mouths.  So their lines where  urlLink quite amusing , even for the  urlLink players ! And we even had a  urlLink musical act  :^)  Then, after many hours of fun and talking, smiling, being taken pictures of...etc...etc, we went to the hotell for our wedding night *wink wink*. But enough of that, here are some more pictures from the party that night:   urlLink my aunt and her twins singing a song for us   urlLink my buddies  (from the right; my best man Tor Atle, John Thomas and Vidar)  urlLink my wife and her bridesgirl   urlLink my mom and dad enjoying the cake   urlLink the new family   urlLink me and my wife  and  urlLink me and my wife again   Now that's about all there is to say about out wedding day at the moment. There's more to come later one so don't panic ;^)   After we got home...  ...I started my new job, quite fun I must say. And we went on a small vacation this weekend. Now  that  was a great thing to do. We really needed that time off after all this planning and shit. And we had a great time. just the two of us...all alone...in a cabin with a sauna and other nice things ;^)  So, did you make it this far? Wow! You're a great reader/fan/friend then :^)  Sorry about the size of the pictures, but I didn't wanna spoil the great quality to much. So now you know why I've been so quiet these past weeks.  But spread the word, da man is back!! With backup! (BM 2 )  And thanks for all the mails (no, correction, the  one  mail) I got. And the nice greatings in various sites all around. Mucho nice-o :^D  Btw, what happend to  urlLink this fella ? Wasn't he supposed to be such a bad-ass reporter? Wuzz!

						   Hi.  I just popped in to say "hello" and "welcome (back?)" to my relatives from Alaska. I hope you'll enjoy your stay here at daCrib. And please, do sign my guestbook and/or give me a comment before you leave.  So, when that's out of the way, what have I been doing these few days? Well, if you look around you you'll see what I've been up to ;-) Maybe I'll do some more tomorrow. Anyways, my wife's back from the holidays. She stayed behind for a few days so she'd get more time with her parents and other family members. Okay by me, but damn! That was the longest two days of my life! I can't bare to think about how it will be when she leaves for her obligatory 3 months "try-out" (you know, when she'll be working as a practitioner in the profession she's learning at school....or something like that). Man, that will be 3 months of  urlLink Hell ! I do  not  like the thought of that. But thats in the future...for now.  Good night y'all.

						   Merry soon-to-be X-mas y'all! Just one day left till Christmas eve. I'm giddy as a schoolboy, but I can't say I have that fuzzy Christmas feeling just yet. Dunno what's missing but I hope I get it before tomorrow night. Anyways, I'm at my inlaws now. The trip went almost perfect, if we take away the part with my "one hour sea sickness". I spent the whole morning from 09:00 till about 10.30 at the john... It's the first time in my whole life. I've never been sick on a boat before, not even in the worst weather. Oh well, I survived. And now I'm just chillin' down here :-)  And just to so that I could give you that warm fuzzy Christmas feeling I don't have just yet, I did a quick remake of the colorscheme. So enjoy my [X-mas edition] of the "simplicity" layout!   If not I'll whoop yer ass...hehe

						   OMG!! I think I'm going to be sick. I was surfing around on morpheus, trying to find amateur home videos to watch. Y'know....like the show. Anyways, I download this file about a russian soldier getting "killed". I thought it was just a joke of some sort, but NO! I just watched 5 seconds of a murder!! The file was 25-30 seconds long but when they stuck the knife in his trouth and I heard him scream "noo" and then started to make sick noises I turned it right of. My God! That image is gonna haunt me for a long time. I saw the fear in his eyes. And it was not pretty...  I am, to say the least, pretty shocked...

						    Why men are men.  Now, I thought about doing a little theme thing here for quite some time. And I've desided to do what all men fear the most. I've desided to start a little section called  "why men are men"  or  "why does men act the way they do"  as the long version goes.  Now how this will work is as follows. I'm gonna give you a few days to start sending questions to me by e-mail. Then when I feel I got enough q's I'll start telling you the answers. Now this may endulge revealing Man's darkest secrets, and it might even get me on the most wanted list among fellow guys around the globe. But hey, what one doesn't do for fame, eh?  I'll hold nothing back, I'll be plunt, I'll be sarcastic, I'll even be rude at times, but I will  never  keep any secrets from you about Men! But bevare, after a few of these expose's you might think twice before even looking at a man.  So start e-mailing me those questions ladies (or gay folks...) at:  urlLink WhyMenAreMen AT Bawls.org

						   Why doesn't the permalinks work? Does anybody know? Grr!  Y'know, I got so little to write about these days. Well, actually, that's a lie. I got heeps of stuff I want to write about. But I can't. It's complicated. But since those things are what's going on in my life these days it get's harder to find other things to write. And specially since I really wanna share it with somebody/just rant it out of my system.  *sigh* life ain't ment to be easy is it :-\  I will tell you someday, but not just yet. As I said, it's complicated. Not complicated as in depressive news or anything, just complicated.  But over to other things. Let's see. Anything new in my life. Hmmm..... Doesn't look like it no. I could tell you the boring story about how our TV went to tv-heaven. No? Well I'll tell it anyways. It was last sunday, and we where waiting for the movie to start. Then all of a sudden it went *blizzt* and *bzzzzt* and all of a sudden it was black. Even with full brightnes, all I could get was shadows. So now we're watching TV on a small 18". Was going to boy a new 28" Tv but decided to wait. Instead we're buying a TV-card for my/our computer. Now that makes sence right? Yup, so thought I (told you it was boring did't i, so why did you read it? ha!).  But enough mindless ranting for tonight. Good night y'all :-)

						   *yawn* -- Gosh, is it night time allready? Time flyes as they say. I've been helping my wife study all day. She's writing two papers that's due this week. So she's writing'em all on paper, and I'm typing it all in on the computer. That's a lot of typing... But as Meatloaf once sang (i'm a huge fan!),  "I will do anything for love"  :-)  Good night y'all!

Not for any particular reason. I just felt like it. I  love  my purdy wife!  But now it's a late dinner and a good movie. Tatta for now.

						   First up, it seems  urlLink I'm the font  "velvet"...  "Wowie! You are Velvet! Mysterious and seductive, you like being in charge and in control. You're the trendy popular goddess (editors note: no, God...thankyouverymuch!) and you love every minute of attention that you get, baby."  [tnx to the  urlLink Daily Blah  for that one btw]  Velvet? Never heard of it, don't think I like it either. I'm more of a Georgia, Garamond and Verdana kinda guy.   urlLink The Daily Blah , what a nice site. I like the writers style. It's clean, crisp and a tad bit sarcastic a times. All in all a good blog to read. I got my eye on you boy! ;-)  What else is new? Oh yes,  urlLink Molly  over at  urlLink the stand  said something good while trying to get me to buy an  urlLink umbrella  (like i don't have enough, living in Bergen...it's Norways answer to London x 10!). She said, and I quote,  "Here's a tip: never show your blog to people you might wanna blog about later."  Now that's a good tip. I my self have three rules about having a diary/weblog/blog/log/thingamajig.  1: Dont tell the whole world where your site is, might be a good idea to exlude family as well (annoying as they can be). Trust me. There will be a time when you want to really say  something  about someone! If you are a sucker for compliments about you abnormaly cool site (like me and mine;-) get readers!  2: Do  NOT  give up your url in your resyme! You're job takes up 70-80% of your time. If you can't blog about that, then what's left? Not much I tell you. I've had that problem for quite some time now. Untill I found out (today) that I didn't put my  current  url on the resyme *evil grin and satanic laughter*. Now that whas a relief!  3: These are the golden and unwritten (untill now) rules. These should not be broken. If you already have broken one or two of them. Then follow this third rule. MOVE!! Change url as fast as you can dammit! Save your freedom of speach as fast as you can.  And that ends our brodcast of the day. Good night, and don't lett the bedbugs bite.

						   Yes, new layout. This one is a template, sligtly modified. I'm just to tired these days to fix my own shit, and besides, this layout is so zen :) But for some reason unkown to me it doesn't seem to work just right. I don't know what's wrong and I can't seem to get it fixed. Maybe it's just my Explorer (that wouldn't be the first time) or maybe it's a html error. Give me a beep if you fint out  what  it is.  Bye bye y'all...

						   Something's wrong with the  urlLink sitemeter  counter. It keeps giving me  "unknown"  on most of my refferals. I'd understand it if I'd been editing my webpage on my computer a lot, but I haven't. I haven't done anything on my template for a long time. So why does this happen? It's damn annoying, that's what it is...

						   ATTENTION ALL READERS:  This site will be taking a short break (well, actualy the break's allready begun, as you might have noticed....or not) while I give my new  urlLink GreyMatter  powered layout it's last finish. That may take some time as I'm a total newbie to the layoutsystem in GM. But, anyways...that's what's going on right now. Keep in touch!
