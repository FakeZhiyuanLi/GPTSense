      Kevin and I will be leaving for our trip to England this Tuesday, May 25th. I can't wait! We will be staying with my cousin Rita and her husband Alan in Middlesex most of the time, but we will also be making a short trip to Cornwall to visit the town where I used to live when I was a kid. I haven't been back there since we left almost 24 years ago, but from what I've heard, things haven't changed much! We will be staying at a lovely bed and breakfast in Cornwall and taking day trips by train from there. I ordered 4-day train passes for us, so we can travel anywhere we want around England. Kevin also wants to go to the RAF museum, so that will be one of the places on our agenda. I love London. Everything is just so expensive, and the exchange rate is terrible for us. But I don't care right now--I haven't been back since '99, and after this year of so much stress, I need a trip desperately!  We will unfortunately be able to stay only 10 days, as we both have to be back for when summer classes begin on June 7th. Kevin is continuing with classes at Ozarks Technical Community College this summer, working towards a degree in electronics technology, and I have to take classes for my teaching certification at SMSU. My Tuesday-Thursday class starts at 7:30AM (ouch!), but I'm done by noon every day and have no classes on Fridays. I will also be in the office part-time to develop the four new French classes I will be teaching in the fall, so it won't be a completely relaxing summer. But hey, at least I get a chance to go away for a while. Kevin's parents are planning their first visit here in June as well, another thing to look forward to. I will also be going to Las Vegas over the 4th of July weekend for my friend Angie's bachelorette party, which should be a lot of fun! This job does have its benefits. ;)

      Well, the school year has come to an end--I can't believe I won't have to set my alarm clock Sunday night! It really seemed to go by quickly, especially this semester. I had my ups and downs during the year, but overall I thought it went well for my first year teaching high school full-time. There were many times I wanted to cry (and actually did--good thing I can shut off my web cam or just walk away from my computer when those things happen!), but hearing my students say "Thank you for teaching us this year!" on my last day yesterday made it all worthwhile. It's all so easy to focus on the negative things, but it's nice to know you're appreciated. Teachers need to hear more of that! :)  Next year it looks like I will be teaching all French classes, as there is a school that wants me to teach 50 students in French II through IV at their school. Those classes, along with a French I class, will give me a full schedule. I was a bit concerned about the students at this school and how they will react to me, as I was under the impression that the French teacher's position had been eliminated (as has been happening all too frequently, unfortunately). However, I received a wonderful e-mail yesterday from the current French teacher, and it turns out that she is leaving of her own accord to teach in a bilingual school in Honduras. That is quite an adventure! She wanted to express to me how difficult it is for her to leave her students, and also how relieved her students were to know that they would be able to continue studying French next year. So I am really eager to teach those students and am thinking of all sorts of ideas for their classes! The only concern for me is that I will be teaching them via interactive TV instead of over the Internet, so I am going to have to switch gears from the way I taught this year. I have a lot to learn still, but I am looking forward to the possibilities. Yet another new challenge awaits!  We have finally finished up the process of hiring two new full-time Spanish teachers for next year. After days upon days of staying late at work (including the final interview, which lasted an excruciatingly boring 2-1/2 hours!), we all decided on the same top two candidates. They haven't officially received the positions yet, but it sounds like they will accept. That is a relief! They both seem like they will be good people to work with. I will miss my Spanish students next year, but I am sure they will be just fine with their new teacher!

      Hello everyone! I will try to post here as much as I can, but I will make no promises! I just have so much going on in my life that I can't keep up most of the time, so I know other people definitely can't. So here I will try to organize a bit and also share some things I find that may be of interest to you.  I hope some of you will post comments here so I can keep up with what you are doing as well. This blog is not just about me, but also about the things and people that are important in my life. So please, post away! And if any of you have blogs of your own, please let me know--I would love to check them out!
