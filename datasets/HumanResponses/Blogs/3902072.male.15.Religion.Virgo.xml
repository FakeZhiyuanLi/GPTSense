      I figure... if I'm gonna have a blog, that I should porbably write in it every once in a while, so what better to write about than the things I hate so very much :D!   There's this whole ... hmm ... "Panzy music" scene in teh North america... or that's what I like to call it. Not that I have anything against a change in music, and in people, and in the way people think...I just fucking hate it. Lets get very specific. One particular piece, EMO, sends chills down my spine.   Emo - ISSSSS... music that thinks its special in its own way in stating that it does infact deal with... yes... emotion... I don't know about you, but when I think of music, or art in general, I think of expression... and generally one wouldn't waste their time expressing something they don't feel. Kinda makes you think just how "special" they really wanna be.&nbsp;Which brings us to this.&nbsp;EVERY FUCKING GENRE IS EMO!!! in a sense that, beleive it or not, all music&nbsp;is emotional.&nbsp;I personally find that those who claim to be "emo" do infact&nbsp;listen to and write&nbsp;an entirely different genre of music. To me the whole thing is a bunch of whiney men writing about breakups and having their hearts broken, and blah blah. A good sad song doesn't hurt, but to base a career on some "valentines day special" bullshit seems to me to be a waste of time. I'd get sick... personally. But then again, you can all think for yourselves ;) . &nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm hoping for more groups like the smashing pumpkins, cuz they! ... were cool :P. heheh this has been my&nbsp; 10 minutes worth...   -- I posted this on my other blog b4, but i guess it makes more sense to put it here :\ .
