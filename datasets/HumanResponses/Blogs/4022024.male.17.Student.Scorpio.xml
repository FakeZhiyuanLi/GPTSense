      Hey all. I had a nice relaxing saturday today. Slept till about 1130 and then decided to start thinking about the future. Up until this point I had decided to go to college around here and then possibly La Crosse. But now I've had a change of mind and the colleges I have been looking at are half way across the country. This, to say the least, is slightly troubling. I grew up around here. But then I have to realize that I won't be seeing the same people that I would normally see. I just don't know. But I had better decide soon. The Dells was nuts last night. We went go karting but then it rained. So we slid all over the track and we smashed each other up pretty good. It was fun. I hate neon's. A lot. So on the way home I pulled up next to one and revved my engine. He was pissed. The events that ensued were 3 near accidents and a car full of adrenaline rushed 17 year old guys. IT ROCKED.... I'm gonna be doing some tweaking on both this blog and my other one. So forgive the crude ugly smacktacular state of them if such a view should arise. Don't flame me.   Band of the day ...   Taking Back Sunday

      Hey all. Here I am again. Friday. Who ever invented them this is a shout out to you. I love you. This is one Friday I do NOT plan on spending indoors and alone. I am definitely headed to the local tourist hole to enjoy my remaining summer nights. This is a good thing for me. I found recently that I can be happiest when distracted from all that makes me upset or sad. There is a lot of that right now. But I will spare all you from the details. Stop whinning, I won't tell you. If you really want to cheer my up you can tell people who you think will like my site.... about my site. Then I can get more people to read. w00t!! I have one week of work left before I'm forced to move on and find a different one to use for a money inflow during the school year. Yippee fricken Skippee.    ... I walked out of work today and I saw the sky blue above me, saw the billowing puffy clouds, felt the absolutly perfect temperature, breathed the wonderful air and let it fill my lungs, and I realized something quite suddenly... The world can be a beautiful place. If you let it. Despair, depression, anxiety, worry, guilt... all of them, non existant in the one fleeting fantastic moment where it is just you and the world around you. The only thing is, that moment leaves. You are then transported to the shithole the really exists, you realize that nature is over looked, over abused, and under appreciated. And no one cares at all. The colors, the sights, the view. It all becomes a photograph in your mind, a poloroid that will fade with time along with that brief moment of bliss, that photograph is proof of a thing that could be that never will.........

      Well Hello out there! It is an absolutly beautiful day out here in craptown WI. I love it. I stayed after work today to play dodgeball with some local little kids. It was fun. I also played with a few friends from school and a few co workers. My song title day is a harsh one, I know. The sad thing is; however, that I find it to be true. That no particular insignificant person receives any amount of gratitude or satisfaction worth their time... until they are buried. There are, of course, exceptions to my little revelation and I live for exceptions. But who cares. It's a solid theory. I tried to counter that theory by thanking the first person who commented on my blog with an email. I also told them that I will update it just for them. I hope they will hold me to that. I meant it. So, I officially dedicate this post to my first commenter!!! Thanks!!! .... 10 points to the first person to guess what band my title is from today. If I can get an email, I'll even email the points to you, personally. I know, it's incredible. But I guess I'm just giving like that. This is a decent length post. Enjoi and Au Revoir!!   Band of the day time ....   New Found Glory   (I love em so!!!)

      I've decided, that the title of my blogs, unless a more suitable title is found, will be song titles. Because, well, I heart musix. I'd like to take this oppurtunity to thank my two fans who posted comments on my site yesterday. I wasn't expecting any kind of reaction for a long long time. I hope they continue to come back and read, whatever it is that winds up here. Hmmm, if any of you are slightly down in the dumps,  urlLink go watch this really weird cat . I love him so. But promise me you won't get weirded out. He is cute isn't he? "yes." Thank you. ORRR  urlLink you can watch this middle eastern guy swear at someone.  It's hilarious. Because I'm sick and twisted like that. Band of the day time....   Motion City Soundtrack  !!! w00t

      So uh, I dont expect to have too many visitors, at least at first. I don't want them to come all at once, because, well, that's just boring. If you are a video game nut comme moi then jump to my other blog.  urlLink jdoobs.blogspot.com . I'm here to warn all of you that this site will not be exciting by any means. It's my whatever blog. So I suppose I will introduce myself. Hi, I'm Jesse. I'm 17 and I live a stupid town of 10,000 in the middle of Wisconsin. Excited yet? I am!!! I'm fairly self confident which makes it believable when I say that the kind of guys that all those shallow girls are looking for would love to beat the crap out of me. If you don't understand that then you don't belong here. But I'm a nice guy. and I LOVE musix, with an x. I think that's good. Hopefully I'll have some daily what-have-you's for you when ... ever. Laterz

      Hey all, just to clear up any mysteries, my song title today is by MCS... who I love dearly now that I have had the chance to throughly listen to their album. They have some happy songs. I like it. I need some happy. Today is gonna be dubbed the official day of countdowns in my life. The countdown to the end of work. The countdown to school starting. The countdown to Halo 2. The countdown to Fable.... uuugh, I need sleep. I was up until 1:30ish last night talking to my favorite red of all time. No, I won't say I regret it, because this wasn't the first time and it won't be the last. In fact, I happen to love talking to her. Actually, I'll just go ahead and dedicate this post to her today. I know that none of you have a problem with that. If you do that's just rotten poopie cookie dough for you isn't it? I like cookie dough, but there's a point, somewhere around where it becomes rotten/poopie, that I draw the line. I hope you will too. Or at least draw one some what sensible? Please? Thaaaanks!!!   PS... I just checked out my hit counter waaaay at the bottom by my cool smiley guys and it says that 20 new people have visited in the last 4 days. I guess my message is out. w000000t!!!!!!!

      Hey all, sorry about the lack of postage yesterday, I was busy with work and I didn't get back from Madtown till like 9:30. I bought a bunch of new CD's yesterday though. I was pretty happy about that. New obsession with a band. The Early November. I love them, you heard it here first. Early November kicks major @$$... So, let me ask you this. Ever been lonely? And I don't mean "man I wish I had someone to do something with" lonely. I mean "down in the dumps, can't stop thinking about it and everytime you do you don't want to anymore" lonely. How did I describe that so specifically you ask? Take a stab in the dark. I bet you'll get it right.   It wouldn't have to be so bad if not for the circumstances. But I guess some people don't take that into account. Not that I am here to hold a grudge. I'm not the bad guy here. It's just unbelievable how somethings work out. Such is life. But I've always been told the good times will out weigh the bad. I'm waiting for one of those to slide my way. "Well it could be worse." I don't care. It isn't so I'm not real worried about that part. But enough about that stuff. It's all written to vaguely for any of you to care. Not that I expect you to. I don't expect much out of anyone anymore. Usually you won't see it anyway. School will be starting soon again, I can't begin to describe to you the feeling of being torn the way I am about it. There's so much negativity surrounding it. Yet at the same time I want to. Meh, whatevuh...   I fell. Into the darkness. Into the spiraling never ending abyss that is the swirl known all too well by many. The swirl consumes the light, the hope, the glimmer of anything but itself. Why? I tumbled. Going down, knowing full well that return to the fore mentioned was entirely impossible. I never wanted this to happen. The light fades, and I long for its warmth. But I've seen the truth. The light is cold now, relentless, unforgiving, uncaring. Why? It knows not of my falling. How can it? It doesn't care remember? I keep telling myself that. Why? Wanting to go back but knowing it seems senseless for I've accepted it now; the fact that I can't return. Still I save room for hope. After all why not, I have nothing better to do anyway. Why? The unanswered question. It may very well never be answered. I don't want to hear that question anymore. The answer won't come to me any faster. Get these questions, these accursed thoughts out of my head. Drive them from my memory... Impossible, no one cares. Not the light, not the swirling darkness, not my kin. Why? I don't know. Maybe the answer is "why not?" This would match the newly founded characteristics of the light. Whatever the answer, it's not good enough. Not good enough to reason my casting into this hell. I didn't deserve the abandonment, the tossing, the casting into this abyss...     Why?

      Hey everybody!!! A lazy sunday. I did absolutly nothing today. Enjoyed every minute of it too. Which, unfortunately, leaves me with very little to write about today. Don't flame/hate/stalk/threaten me. Today was spent mostly trying to convince my dad to let my hook up my Xbox to his massive 6.1 Dolby Digital surround sound system. So far no luck. My parents both think I can't handle electronic equipment. The only thing is I know more about electronics then both of them combined. They fear comes from naivity. A down side for me. I'd buy my own system, but that leaves very little funds for anything else. Of course I could get a lousy one. But what's the point of spending the money then. The other part of my day was spent yurning for an upcoming game that is to be released the 14th of September. I cannot wait!!!! But, I have to... "You hit the road and left me an ocean, I can't swim in the silence of your, skin! skin!"   Band of the day...   Something Corporate

      As you may or may not have heard, in the halo 2 trailer that I posted about a mere four posts down, a little occurance was sighted. At the end of the trailer when Micro$oft flashes its usual logo and website, the site www.xbox.com was temporairly replaced with the site  urlLink www.ilovebees.com  when you get there, any normal person would think. "WTF?" ...  urlLink Want to know more? go here and read away my friends...

      Doesn't look like theres going to be much in the way of Halo 2 updates for a while so I'm here to introduce the other game who has sucked my life from me and refuses to ease its death grasp upon me. The game is Fable. In Fable, you start out as a child and slowly grow into an adult. Fable is an emergant gameplay game. Meaning that, for instance, if you break your leg as a child at the beginning of the game, you will have a limp for the rest of your "life." or perhaps if you get cut on the arm as a child, you will retain the scar from the cut through the rest of the game... You can check out the Fable trailer from E3 this year  urlLink here   Oh, and here's a screenie... An example of an evil character

      Well no, it really isnt, but you wish it were...It's really fricken late so I thought I'd take this oppurtunity to say, Halo 2 = sweet sweet love, and Master Chief = My man love... Well kinda not really, I brake for those who love him, I have a suggestion, if you dont know about the guys over at RvB you should check them out.  urlLink www.redvsblue.com  If not then you can look at this... SCREENIE TIME!!!!   If you will notice the green blob over the closest spartans head, the one that kinda looks like an overcharged plasma pistol shot, That, my friends, is the convenant sniper rifle shot...

      Time to bask the other game in a little beautiful light now. Halo 2 will be back probably the 24th when this whole conspiracy has cleared up. Fable. What can be said about such a wonderfully sexy game. It is nearly two months earlier on the release slate then Halo 2. Now some may say, "Oh, Fable sounds like a good game to tide myself over until Halo 2's release."  NO!!  ... this would be a grave error in judgement. Fable is in it's own class here and until KOTOR was released was a first in the emergent gameplay field. Oh! Lucky you! 5 new screenies were just released today from the game. And me, being the nice guy I am, will give you the nicest one.  PS... I just noticed that gamespot has an updated impressions article on the game. Read it  urlLink here

      Well, phase two was completed today on the zanny IloveBees countdown. The only noticable difference thus far is that the site is even more f***ed up than before. This is what got me tho. In Bungie's weekly update, they specifically said, and I quote, " An update for conspiracy theorists:  I've sorta been following the fuss – too busy to really get into it, but Halo 2 will still release on Nov. 9th in the US and most other places, and Nov. 11th in the UK. Nor will we release a playable demo, anytime soon. In fact, we're so busy with the game that there's no chance we'll even think about a playable demo until after Halo 2 ships. And that is official. It isn't happening folks. The game is however, happily on schedule for November 9th." ... so much for THAT little theory. All I have to say is thank Alah for no demo. But we are still all left to wonder what exactly will go down on the 24th. Time will tell obviously....  No screenie today, sorry

      I stumbled upon a nice Fable documentary today. It has a strange british guy who acts stupid but it's really good. I suggest watching it in one sitting but its about 35 minutes long.  urlLink Here's the link.   Aaaand here's a screenie...
