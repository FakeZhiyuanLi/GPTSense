						    #9: Good programmers are typically lazy people.  They want to automate everything so they don't have to do it manually.    Just have any programmer push the same button more than 15 minutes and it will be automated faster than you can say "This process sucks".

						   Am I getting smarter or is the world getting dumber.  I do know one thing I become less tolerant of the stupid people in the world every day.  What's worse is that the government keeps helping stupid people survive.  "Seat Belt Law" - Who are they kidding?  If you're not smart enough to buckle up it's your own fault.  What's worse is that people still get tickets for it!  I say, go ahead and have those people signup as crash test dummies.  Obviously they don't think the crash will hurt them.

						    #7: If you dish it out be sure you can take it back.   One thing though is that if you're good enough at dishing it out you usually don't have to take it because someone doesn't want the quip coming back at them!

						    #2: Never eat anything bigger than your head.   Most of my friends instantly reply with "Well Rob, that doesnt leave much you can't eat.".   #3: Have a good sized ego, you never know when you're going to need it.   If you know your shit, people will respsect you no matter how big your head is.  Just remember to give credit where it's due!

						   Ok, so you have to post a really good one for the first one right?  If you don't are you doomed for failure?  Youre obviously crazy if you think I care enough about what others think.  To that end:   #1: Learn from other peoples mistakes, you'll never live long enough to make them all yourself

						   Being a product of the 70's and living most of my teenage years through the 80's I believe I have grown up through a truly unique time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had computers, but I didn't have an internet.&nbsp; I had computers, but I didn't have storage space.&nbsp; Computers were in such an infantile stage for the young it was a new outlet of expression.&nbsp; Much like a skateboard I used a computer like it was an extension of my body.&nbsp; I used it more than I used a car or any other machine in that time period.   The movie "War Games" I think inspired many people my age (although few will admit it).&nbsp; Many kids my age really wanted to hack into different things and gain control.&nbsp; We in a way forged the new security systems of today.&nbsp; I personally remember obtaining illegal access to long distance codes to "Download Games" which topped the scales at 360K.&nbsp; These games were located in every state but mine.&nbsp; Each game holding my interest for at least 10 or 15 minutes before I had to get back online and download a new one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Years later when I told my parents of the things I did when I was much younger some of which they could not believe.&nbsp; I told them there were times where I truly expected the cops to come banging on the door.&nbsp;   Things brings up a good story of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few of my friends decided that because someone would not share their warez with us we would play a trick.&nbsp; I had a deeper voice at the time so we called this kid up and I played a "FBI" agent and talked to this kid for about 20 minutes and told him we'd be at his house the following day to go over it with his parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; He ended up burying his software in his back yard.&nbsp; Of course the FBI never showed but we had a good laugh.&nbsp;   Another great story of the time ( or at least one I found amusing )&nbsp; was a store called "Digital World" run by some middle eastern family had what we thought was really over priced merchandise.&nbsp; Come to think of it we had no idea what a "good deal" was at the time but it was more than we could afford.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a Commodore 64 computer (with GREAT sound at the time.&nbsp; SID chips rocked!)&nbsp; we also had the "Commodore 64" music which we could play with the old SYS49152 command.&nbsp; This played really good music which was comparable to some cheeky music you hear on commercials.&nbsp; A tape recorder later and we had our own marketing plan!&nbsp; We said "You've been chosen to get a free commodore 64 computer from Digital World".&nbsp; "Call now and you can claim your free computer.&nbsp;"&nbsp; we also gave the phone number.&nbsp;&nbsp; We would call random people and then play the tape.&nbsp; We would then call the store (which only had one phone line) to see if it was busy about 2 minutes later.&nbsp; We laughed every time knowing that the guy on the other end of the phone was trying to explain that they weren't giving away a computer and really confused on who would do that.&nbsp; Come to think of it, who would do something like that?&nbsp; It was funny as hell at the time.&nbsp;   Kids today will never really experience the feeling of connecting to a BBS or having a speed dialer call a BBS just to get one of 2 open lines.&nbsp; They will never see the modem response codes of "CONNECT 2400" and thinking this is the fastest ever!&nbsp; They will never see NO CARRIER at the end of every call to a BBS.&nbsp; These things of the past were special to me but all but lost in time as many things are.

						   Remember that you always have a unique past.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your past is not like your mother or fathers, and theirs was not like yours.&nbsp; Perspectives change, and change is good.&nbsp; Remember your past and try to pass it onto the future so they can learn from the things you have done.

						   It is a fine art to know when you have done something wrong.&nbsp; It is important to realize that and to accept it.&nbsp; Move on after this don't dwell on it.&nbsp; This is an important lesson to learn but a hard one to follow.
