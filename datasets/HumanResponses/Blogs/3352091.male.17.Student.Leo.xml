      At last my soul cries... FREEDOM!! and i know what it means. I felt more alive today then i have in a long time for some reason. I dont know if its because i have a new sense of life and a new chance to start over from scratch or if i was just unusually giddy today.        "From the moment we depart       We never know where the beginning began or        The end did start" Ahh. to be able to breath breathe anew and feel my soul take flight to the heavens above. The stars are the limit as the first step of an impossible journey begins and becomes possible. For is that not what life is, a journey?

      ok, so i havnt written in a few days.... BITE ME! lol. The most incredible thing hit me today while i was getting my dreads done(By the way, excellent job kyla) it was weird in a way because doin this and then shaving all but the facial hair on my chin, it was like not creating a new me but moving on in a way. I look a little younger than i like but this feeling i have now is amazing, I have finally not forgotten a certain someone but somehow this little transformation has helped me accept a change in life, and i have decided not to look back on it. When friends are lost, dont try to win them back because if you were a true friend they werent lost because of you, rather dont assert any effort other than that you normally did( saying hey, conversations if they can carry one and want to, etc) If they truly were your friend in the first place they will come back and if they dont, then so be it. I have moved on in my life and seeing old doesnt make me feel as though i am running from an emotionally painful past but rather healing and growing/accepting the future and becoming it. For all of you with heartaches or stress or whatever it may be, lifes to short to dwell on it. Dwelling only makes the pain sharpen, believe me i did it and i know. As i said accept it and heal into the future for change often occurs and if we spend our whole life trying to fight it, we spend our life fighting our own life(if you can understand that).

      WOW! Graduation was surreal. I still dont fully comprehend than Im actually free from high school... all the social constraints, all the worthless high school crap that goes on. SUmmer finally here, my last summer with my high school friends. Statistics say that you never keep in touch with even three quarters of your graduating class, my only hope is to find some friends such as the more recent ones ive made in my last few days of high school. Well I'll enjoy the summer, but i cant wait for college life, new people and places, and its odd that life gives you 4 opportunities to create a reputation for yourself, the self you create at the beginning of your school career, the one u have in high school, the one you get in college, and finally the one when you start your journey in the real world. I really like the person I've become, with an exception of some bad habits but I dont think there is one person who doesnt have them. I dont wish to recreate myself, I only wish for people's view of who i  am to be positive. More than anything in the world i wish to stay true to myself and not change to adapt to new surroundings but to change because my tastes and perspectives have changed.             "We Know who we are, but we know not who we may be"                                                  -Shakespeare    Oh yea I saw one of my college friends last night for the first time since tenth grade i believe. She looks pretty and im going to the same college as her sooo.... hey new place new situations lol hope i make the best of them

      *Yawwnn* wow what an uneventful day its been soo far. My mind has wondered to the stars and back in this time. For some reason ive been listening to the moulin rouge cd all day, ive never realized how great it was untill today. And i totally agree with one of the lines on the cd "the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return" ok im not an overemotional guy, but think about it. Feeling over fact may not always be "correct" in a sense, but its the only way the soul can manifest itself in your every actions and that is my reason for be a romantic. Being simple does not necessarily mean you're stupid, quite the contrary often we do not see the truth because it is so simple. Many people overthink things and problems, but if we could just sit down and listen to that part of us that knows the absolute truth we will be better off. Ill explain my views on absolute truth sometime later in my blogg. What is it within me that cries out for love, beauty, and truth.

      wow, i wish i had known some people before my senior year. Especially this one girl. We can have a decent talk about emotions and human behavior and stuff its really relieving to know their is someone of the opposite sex that feels the same about some subjects lol. So many people so little time. No one can know all their is to know, but the best thing we can do with what we do know is enhance someone else's knowledge and further them along the path that we perhaps didnt get to due to our short time here on eart(100 years)  "I hope you dont mind, I hope you dont mind that I put down in words, how wonderful life is, now you're in the world"

      FInally school over with. all exams done. high school over? wow seems like only yesterday i got there as a freshman. Time seems to fly when you look back on it. All the friends ive made this year and years past, i wont see nearly half of them again. well atleast the chapters not over yet i still have graduation ceremony the 25 of May. Perhaps this sounds like i dont cherish the past 17 years of my life in this little town, but to tell you the truth "this town's too small for a man of my ambition"(Big Fish) I will miss my friends and family, but to start a new part of the book of my life. It's like u just finished the first part and it left you in suspense like what will happen to me or whoever, thats what makes you want to read the second part of the novel. New friends, new surroundings, new classes, new school..... a new love maybe. Possibly, all things come with time but that doesnt mean u have to forget the old, on the contrary the old is what makes the new so invigorating and i hope that i will be able to see that when i arrive at my dorm this fall.

      ohh i stayed up till like eleven last night on the computer, i know half of you think thats early but i NEED my sleep. I got up to go to school today most everything was normal. I got to first period and i found out that i was one point short of exempting my exam for english. That sucks a big one. after that i went to my math class (which is boredom sent from Dante's Inferno)and had to put up with a bitch of a substitute, not to mention her incompetence. I got out of school a little after 3rd period (because i dont have anymore exams that day) and went by Laura's house to drop off a cd i burned for her but she didnt answer the door either because she wasnt there or didnt hear me knock. After that i drove my butt back over to my dads house and ate lunch and then drove over to my moms house to write all this in my blogg. Well i dont really have any plans for the rest of the day other than to pick up my sister and her friends from school. My dad is and ok guy, well until he married my stepmom. She has this fake niceness about her and she has convinced my dad that they need to be MORE HOLY. i have already expressed my views of spirituality, if you set out to try and look good and try to APPEAR holy ur nothing but a hipocrit and do things for external rewards(in other words ur a total fake) anywho i guess i can put up with her for a night or so. well until another time my friends

      Yesss. the first sunday of my post i can finally explain my views on spirituality. First and foremost i want to say that i am of the christain faith(for lack af a better title).When someone asks me my religion i say that i am of the faith of the christ. So many people and happenings give the name Christain a bad name, and i understand its not all people but i try to set myself apart. So many "Christians" have become so dogmatic with their demonination or church's viewpoints its pathetic. Instead of listening to preachers and doing everything they say i follow my own path. I try to follow the actions(not so much the words) of Jesus. He was compassionate towards all(even those of different faiths) he listened and was caring towards all. I love the Zen saying "Follow not in the footsteps of the teacher rather, seek what He sought" and i believe with all my soul and heart. Some people may consider this blasphemy (quoting zen wisdom and applying it to christianity) but they are the ones who never seek and are content with being ignorant.  Well my parents are selling the house(as soon as they find a buyer) and they are showing the house today at 330-430 and for some reason i have to leave the house. Go figure. It wont really affect me because since i havnt told you my parents have both divorced and both live in easley, so either way i have a house to stay at here. I may go see my teacher from the summer governors school today in a play he is performing in(lead role i might add) hes a very good and virtuous man. Very wise and i wish i had listened to him more, he taught me the value of tolerance(i dont want to call it that but i dont know what else to call it) well thats enought writing..... for now anywho. Later all

      This whole log is dedicated to the song "100 Years" since the song about a man who looks back on his life and sees everything, i thought it appropriate.   Well to begin with im a 17 y/o senior at EHS. I love all aspects of the theatre and my soul is one with the sea when i surf. I am heading to the college of charleston this fall(2004)   Not to sure how i feel today, i got the new Five For Fighting cd (the battle for everything) and though its a great cd it brings up memories of a broken heart(acquired 4 weeks ago and 3 before prom). Very good cd to ponder and listen to the lyrics. I also had a very good talk with a friend about life in general and relationships. One thing ive learned my senior year in high school is to value the moment you live in. I was always looking toward college and i really am going to miss my little home town and the things in it, especially one particualar person that will always hold the first and a special place in my heart(whether she believes it or not)  On another note i think im gonna go rent the last samurai movie i havnt seen it yet and it looks like itd be a good watch

      In all my life I have never found a poem or reading that speaks to my life and immortal soul such as this poem. No scripture(which may sound heretical) and what mystifies and raises this writing more is the fact that it is with music, the language which all humans know    "When the cold of Winter comes    Starless night will cover day    In the veiling of the sun    We will walk in bitter rain          But in dreams      I still hear your name     And in dreams     We will meet again      When the seas and mountains fall     And we come, to end of days     In the dark i hear a call     Calling me there     I will go there     And back again"                           -Fran Walsh   Such is life and the path is treads from friendships to that of a deeper substance, that which is beyond all comprehension and/or logic

      Your Eric Matthews! Your funny and a good friend, and love to hang out with others. Can't say your a loner really, because you just love being around friends and family and making people laugh.

      TOnight was my first night of practice for Tartuffe. Eventhough i dont have a single line i had a blast just being there and watching other people. The director has some funny ideas this play is gonna be hilarious. Other than the fact that i am performing with a professional theatre, there are two girls there who well, seem to be worth getting to know, especially since one is going to be a sophmore at the C of C next year.(Yes im going for the older women that way when i fail i have an explanation lol) anywho i had to drive through some crap storm on the way home i dont like driving in storms but its funny how something so violent can be so soothing just to sit on your front porch and watch. Its poetry in motion and it soothes the most inner depths of my soul just to watch (wish there would have been more storms a month or so ago lol) There are hardly any big storms around here lately so when one does come you have to hold on to the memory as long as possible. The disturbing cracking of the thunder, the shimmering of the lightning, and the sweet sound of the rain on my window. This is a language that is innate in all beings.

      Ok dont ask why im posting this like 2 seconds after the last one, but i have this strange urge to go downtown greenville and just kind of walk around and have fun with my friends, then after we all look like losers downtown for the last time we could go to the Pavillion and ice skate and look like..... you guessed it ice skating losers. lol im really gonna miss hanging out with some of the people here at home, but im sure Charleston will have a lot more to do and a lot more interesting people to go do those fun things with lol best of all theres so many things to do, you forget when your doing the same thing over and over lol(uhh if that makes any sense which i doubt it did lol) On another note i had this weird dream while in NY. I dreamed that i was in an irish pub playing the saxophone and that was the whole dream, i was just playing like smooth jazz and then some upbeat stuff. while its easy for me to translate others dreams its hard to translate your own (personally i think it takes an objective mind to do this) so if someone reads this and had an idea just post it here as to what this cool dreams might mean lol

      Well I just got back from New York City yesterday. Dude it was amazing though it was sort of a let down, i mean you hold some place up to "magical" standards (so to speak) and when they dont meet them its a let down. You can pretty much do the city in 4 hours(shops places to eat etc). But the second night we were there we went to see "The Producers"(written by Mel Brooks) it was so frikin hilarious. I mean you couldnt stop laughing. That was my first time seeing a Broadway performance. I was also corrected in my thinking of Broadway, i thought that it was just one theatre called Broadway but its actually just all the plays that are in theatres in the street Broadway(well that clears up a lot of my misconceptions like how they have 5 plays going on in the same theatre within the same week lol) New York is a great place to go, unfortuneately you have to be 21 to go out at night and just kind of have fun by downing an irish drink and hustling the local pool table (hehe). The city lights up at night and it almost looks like the wizard of oz (crap comparison i know) well anywho now tonight i have blocking for Tartuffe and i was planning to go to the lake house with some friends so thats been delayed, ill only be able to go wednesday night through thursday night now. Well thats 2 nights to have fun and my best friend is driving up from charleston to come with me(well be the only 2 guys lol but most of our friends arent really the type u stare at in a bathing suit) so its just going to be a blast. well i gotta go do some stuff. If there is one thing i learned from going to New York, it's this : Some places are better left unvisited, or else you ruin the mysticism that made them so wonderful in your mind.

      *YAWNNN* what the hell am i doing up at 9:24 in the morning? well anywho i leave for NY late later tonight(or perhaps extremely early tomorrow morning whatever you call it)3am to be exact. I cant wait, ive always wanted to visit new york. I want to enjoy my summer to its fullest but i also cant wait for college. To quote a favorite movie of mine:  "I find I am so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it is the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain... I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams... I hope"                        -The Shawshank Redemption  Really a powerful and moving movie if you havnt seen it suggest you go rent it or buy it its a beautiful thing. well ill probably write later today to make up for when im in NYC. later days

      i have decided im going to open up a dream website and ask people to post their dreams cause i have fun deciphering them. well i had one last night, here goes  i was at some sort of samurai training program and we got swords(there was like a 10 dollar admission fee though). but later in the program the sensei told us to fight and not hold back. for some reason or other i was shirtless and i had my swords. i admitted to the sensei i was afraid to die and i told him i was leaving, and then i walked out the door.   thats all i remember. im good at helping others with their dreams but i cant decipher my own i think it has to do with outside opinions. if i interpret my dream i may be biased so id appreciate some help from anyone on this one

      Wow is all i have to say. You dont know why high school sucks so much untill you experience college. I had orientation thursday through friday. My dad and me headed down there wednesday night and i stayed in the dorm rooms for that night and thursday night. And lets see the girl to guy ratio is like 3 to 1 so hell ya. FInally a chance. SPeaking of girls its easy as hell to get some girls number down there. I got more numbers from girls in two days at an orientation than i got all through high school. The class advisers sucked, its like they had no clue what the fuck they were doing, So i went to mark landis' office (head of theatre dept) and declared my major as theatre and he helped me with my schedule. well im gone.

      I couldnt sleep at all last night. I constantly felt as though someone was watching me, very unsettling feeling. I was always on the brink of waking up at the slightest noise or movement, like a soldier on the battlefield. Then around 7:30 am the words "Awake You" flashed red on a black background. very unerving. If anyone feels they know what this means please email me or give me a comment because this is really making me think and wonder. Was it just my biological clock or was it a hint into something deeper in my mind?

      Dude havnt written in awhile but nothing exciting or extremely enjoyable has happend until today. Theres this girl from the C of C (im going there next year) in the cast im currently in, and quite beautiful i may say. Anywho im not exactly the most outgoing confident guy so i hadnt asked her to really do anything though im attracted to her. Well as coincidence would have it the show was cancelled today and as i was walking out to my car to get something she drives through the parking lot(and im loooking like an idiot cause i have this afgan blanket over my head cause i was joking around with theatre friends and im going out to my car to grab my phone) and rolls down the window to say hey and give me my pen back that she has had for like three days now. Well we talked to a minute and like out of nowhere (probably my subconsious) i just spit out the words and ask her if she wanted to go to coffee underground for something to drink or eat and she said yes to my astonishment. Once i met her there like ten minutes later dude we sat there and talked for over and hour. We talked about theology, morals, theatre, college, man this girl is awsome. Only thing we talked about relationships and she sounded like she didnt want one currently, she said how she has constantly been in one since ninth grade and how she didnt plan it that way but how it just happened. Maybe itll "just happen" again. well this girl is awsome ive never talked to anyone except my best friend for an hour straight about the stuff we discussed. And the thing is i was totally comfortable around her. Hey maybe college has more in store for me than just learning and meeting new people and gaining a theatre portfolio

      WOW!! two weeks till im 18 and i move into college that weekend, what a blast itll be. Though i do intend to leave a few instructions to my friends who are still in high school, mainly who they need to take care of for me since im gone. I will truly miss all of them, though i havnt tried to keep in touch with that many of my friends that have gone off to college, only a select few. They all have a place in my life where they have influenced me in thought word and deed, Im not the wisest in the world or even claim to have much wisdom but i hope they will come to me and talk if they have anything they need to talk about. My door is always open and my mind works like and open parachute,(the best way a parachute works is by being open) To anyone who knows me and might say that i show no emotion, its only because when i was little i always tried never to cry because my parents were divorced and as a result it takes more than a miraculous thing to stir tears within me. Here are some tips for anyone to live a happy life. Never be afraid of a tear because they need to be shed and it feels good to shed them (from what i can remember) Whether out of sorrow because of hardships or because of joy from an awe inspiring film or performance. Laughter is the best medicine and i know this for a fact, it spreads joy though the body even if only for the time you are laughing. Take a deep breath whenever life seems to pound at your being, know that life was given as a gift and you can only know happiness if there is sorrow to compare it to. Always remember tomorrow is but a day away.  And the last thing i say is often the hardest because it has the potential for the biggest hurt, Have an open heart. Yes its true if you close it off you wont be hurt AS easy but then again for all the hurt of an open heart, It is only magnified tenfold when a little joy is let in with people who you truly care about and who truly care about you.  And to vern who always reads my blogg thanks for making me feel like someone actually reads and is interested in my life lol
