      Why does it seem like a good idea when you are at the bar with your friends to keep saying "yes" to "do you want another beer?" when you know that you have to be&nbsp;at work at 8am and if you stay out late 8 am comes even quicker than it normally does. Didn't they ingrain it into us as children to "Just Say No"? Nancy Reagen would NOT be proud of me. I did not D.A.R.E. to keep myself off drugs last night.   INSANITY: preforming the same actions over and over and expecting different results.  yup that is my life. And the bar wasn't even worth it because this person that&nbsp;I have been doing a proverbial dance with for the past year decided it would be a good idea to try to come talk to me after standing me up the last time we were supposed to have a big serious talk about our relationship, or lack there of one, not to mention it was said persons idea to have this talk and I was the only one that showed up for it. yeah whatever. I was going to comment on Kerry's speech last night but I feel I need some more time to collect my thoughts, so for now Salute and just say NO!!

       Sooo I am just now jumping on this whole blogging band wagon. It seems pretty cool and seeing as though I am perpetually bored at work, hopefully this will prove to&nbsp;be a source of&nbsp;entertainment to pass the hours untill I am bored and not at work. &nbsp;I just recently graduated from college and I find myself in a job that has absolutley NOTHING to do with my degree (which I am sure I am the 1st person this has ever happened to) but the thing is that there is not even an opportunity to get into my field.&nbsp; All my plans got messed up. I was supposed to be going to law school in the fall but I didn't get in, it was really sad there were 250 seats for the one school I applied to and there were 1900 people applying for those seats (damn economy), yeah I wasn't one of them, so now I gotta wait another year and try to be a productive, contributing member of society&nbsp;and I failed to realize what I was getting myself into when I signed up for that label.&nbsp; And now here I am working in an office doing accounts payable, which is a far cry from my degree (political science with a public service specialization). But ya know whatever I guess.&nbsp;and so concludes my first blog, I hope it was as good for you as it was for me...right.

       Do you ever just want to like go somewhere that is not where you are and at really desperate times could be anywhere and re-create yourself? Not so much re-create yourself I guess but re-create your life. New friends, new social circles, whatever. I've done it once but it was a long time ago and as much as it was a disaster (I came back home in 6 months; the grass was way greener on the other side) I think it has been so long that it is starting to sound like a good idea again. I have this problem with staying in one place for too long. I believe that this is my mother's fault. (I don't mean that in the sense of I blame my mother for how my life turned out and I don't mean it negatively, I like the fact that I am so restless, I think it makes me strive for more so that I can move on) Anyways, when I was little we used to move all the time and I don't remember it ever being sad I was always excited at the possibilitiesI guess. I got really good (and still am) at adjusting quickly but I guess it had some negetive effects in that I am extremely restless. And  Icould leave a place with out looking back pretty easy. I mean don't get me wrong there are people that I would still talk to. I think I missed my calling and I should have joined the circus or worked for some traveling festival. I have no musical talent so maybe I could be a roadie. Do they let girls do stuff like that? hmmm.       It's really funny the closer you get to people the more they think they own you, like by them knowing you better than most gives them some claim on you, not so much posession in the psychotic way but more in like a jealous way. And then you do something and some how your action that had nothing to do with them turns into a personal attack on them and it is all completely your fault? yeah I guess this makes no sense from the outside and it is completely spurratic but it is working for me so i'm going with it. Why is that that we think we can claim possession over people? that's a really strange concept. Like is it human nature ? Or are we programmed to "obtain" things and so it just floods over to our personal lives along with our material objects. Like it's a little different my husband/my wife whatever but like just your friends even. "Oh so and so is MY best friend". "Oh so and so is MY really good friend".  What about "WE are really good friends". "WE are best friends". that's rather interesting to me i suppose.       Human nature, what a bitch.       So stay stuck in this town for another year and then move somewhere else and start the process all over again...I often wonder when I get the bug to just up and go if I will be like this for the rest of my life. that kinda scares me. Maybe I need to be challenged to plant my roots. but that's way too permanent.    I'm commitment phobic and I am proud!

      You have no Idea how I wish it was Sundy. I really think the weekends wear me out more than the week days. Saturday night I attempted to watch a movie at my friends house and I became painfully aware of the fact that I have ADD. I cannot sit and watch a movie to save my life. I can however look at everything in the room except for the TV,  go to the bathroom 600 times, smoke like 4 cigarettes, play with matches, get everyone a beer when they need it, light candles, and play solitare. I apologized to everyone after the movie for being such a distraction. I can only really watch movies if I am exausted, stoned, or in the confines of a freezing over priced movie theater where it is dark, you are stuck in an uncomfortable seat, and there are other people there who are not your friends and not so forgiving when you do everything but watch the movie.  At least do to my aprox. 6.7 second attention span I can do many projects at once and do them well. I just have to have like 6 things going on all simultaneously so that there is no chance of me getting bored. It's funny at work I will start a project do half of it start another project, do half and keep doing this until I am bored and start back at the beginning project. I started studying for the LSAT again and I think this time around it is harder because I am kinda mad that I have decided to take it again and therefore have an aversion to studying for it. After all the stress of taking it the first time my consolation prize was that I would not have to ever do that again...and here I am getting ready to go through all that stress agian. I can't wait for the bar (NOT looking forward to that test) . I have researched the test and it drives me crazy that this "aptitude" test is only like aprox. 50% accurate in determining whether you will be successful in law school, they just continue to use it out of tradition or sadistic torture. My friend asked me the other day why I wanted to be a lawyer and I quickly answered because I am a massochist. anyone who has gone through the long hard process of either professional school or graduate school knows exactly what I am talking about. I just keep reminding myself that it is worth it. And yeah I do know it is. so I will just keep studying it. blah back to work.

      Me and a friend of mine were having a conversation the other day about drinking and motives and such and I came up with a conclusion about it. I think that "smart" people drink to become dumb and "dumb" people drink to appear smart. Now not that I consider myself to be exceptionally intelligent but my mind is always going, always thinking, always contemplating and when I drink it shuts it up for a short while. And I have noticed that some people when they drink attempt to exert their "mental dominance" upon other people. It's quite interesting to go to the bar and just observe (well you know drink too, but observe in the process). It's quite amazing to me this world we have here. We have enough resources so that every person on this earth could live comfortably, but we are obsessed with accumulating as much wealth and/or resources as humanly possible and then sitting on it so that it benefits no one but ourselves. For as civilized as we are supposed to be (which when looking at technical and medical advances we really are) we are still barbarians. We trample other countries (not specifically the US, any 1st world nation), steal or take or declare their resources as our own, and give them nothing in return. We are like little children at recess and then the littler (read weaker) children either make friends (read become the lackeys of) with the bigger stronger children or they mock the behavior on children smaller than themselves. For as civilized as we are we completely lack compassion. We try to keep two people who love each other from becoming "married" because it will ruin the sanctity of marriage, tell me where the sanctity is when people can get married for 18 hours/be married 5+ times/ commit adultry/beat their spouse etc. thats sacred and upkeeps the sanctity of the union? And how many people don't see the absurdity of that argument? "God" said marriage is between a man and a woman well "God" also said a whole lot of other crap that no one pays attention to. I am striaght and am completely against the idea of marriage because I think it's a joke and means no more of a commitment to me than just being in a relationship with somebody.  A woman can be threatened with laws that will directly affect her body and life because some religious right wingers want to make personal decisions political?? YOU ARE A MAN YOU HAVE NO SAY!! when you get pregnant then we'll talk!! If you are that against abortions then DO NOT HAVE ONE!!! But do not decide that your choice or your values should be imposed on every other human being just becuase you THINK you are right. We come up with wonderful life changing medical advances (e.g. drugs, precedures etc.) that will save lives or improve the quality of some peoples lives etc. and then we allow pharmacutical companies and insurance companies to charge outrageous prices so that only like the top 10% of the population can afford them (now I am exaggerating slightly but you get the jist)? we are making money off of disease and diseases that are occuring at record numbers because we pollute and have no respect for the environment. "Criminalize the symptons while we spread the disease" thank you Ani D. UGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!  yeah that's been building up for a while. perhaps I should stop talking now and that would be a wise idea. See there's my point about my head always going. and that my friends is why I drink

       So I think that I am convinced that there is some strange time thing that exists and it makes Saturday and Sunday go by in double time. I swear it was just Friday but here I am monday morning back at work. Oh well. It just almost became worth it though because someone just came and dropped us off bagels and although I am much more an english muffin type girl, Einstein Brothers has the best cranberry bagels.    I had this small epiphany this weekend. I live in very very Northeastern Ohio, and  I had to attend this wedding is very very Southern Ohio.  And I now know why most people think of backwoods, farms and corn when they think of Ohio. Wow there was like nothing and the wedding reception was at this "Country Club" yeah it was like a barn, and at the reception there were actually people wearing jeans and cammo and little boys taking their shirts off and running around. it was only like a few hours away from where I live but wow it was totally like another world. Amazing to me. I am so a city girl, like even Cleveland isn't really big enough for me but did I appreciate it soo much more after this weekend. I am also estatic because they are announcing today at 1:00pm where, and when Farm Aid will take place and also who is playing. If you don't know what Farm Aid is, it is a concert that is put on every year and all the proceeds go to independent farmers throughout the country. Willie Nelson, Dave Matthews, Neil Young and John Mellencamp are all like "board of directors" or whatever and orchestrate the whol;e thing. Willie nelson started it I think back in like 1989. It is always a great time and is for a great cause. Ok well there is my randon tangent filled blog for Monday.
