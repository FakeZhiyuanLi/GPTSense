        Hello once again...I have been a slacker for a few days I know but thought I would write something to try and keep this going! If any of my many readers get the chance to do a blog like this, I suggest they try it! Its quite a nice way of keeping a diary of sorts. Saturday night out was cool. Matty had a nice stag night, although he may well not remember it! We started off with a meal [ Italian ] before trying a few bars out that I had not been in before...Walkabouts was great...watched some footy in their too! Ended up at Jumpin Jaks down by the sea front...my first time there too. A little expensive to get in and the drinks too....but a great atmosphere. Ended up dancing like a mentalist. Matts' future wife ended up there too on her Hen Night...kinds weird but theye didn't just 'get off' with each other so not too bad. We got home at 3am and I slept until about 10am...then had to not only contend with the hangover but also some mad tummy ache too. Which carried on for about 48 hours, until a feast of Rennies got it fairly under control! Still a bit niggly though.... Was so ill that I even turned down the chance to go to the pub to see the England vs France game on Sunday night! Although...possibly good job I didn't! Say no more! There hasn't been too much else going on, due to the gut ache! I have turned down two 'naughty sessions' the last two days..so I must have been poorly!! Just been enjoying the amount of footy on the telly at decent times! Anyway...that is all for now...hope to report back in a couple of days!

        I missed a couple of days there but not sure anyone will have noticed! I did send this URL to quite a few people...if you are one of them, then I would love some feedback. At the bottom of each entry, you will see the word 'comment'...if you click on that, you should see a place to leave some nice words! It can then be almost interactive!  It is very late now...I had some trouble with my electric key metre and had to wait up for a nice man to come along and save me from darkness. Not the band though..I like them...although it would have been a bit weird if he was saving me from them!  Its been a very busy day. Went to the new club shop at AFC Bournemouth with Phil, my bro. It was huge...but didn't seem to have much in that wasn't there before. I'm sure it will be lovely soon. While there, we took a look at the pitch through the gaps...the place where we will be playing in a few short weeks! Bearing in mind that they will be ripping the pitch up in August, it still looks pretty well cared for. Still pretty green,,,a couple of bare patches maybe but still looks great to play on! We cannot wait!  We then popped into Poole for an hour before travelling on to a nice Harvester for dinner [ haddock and chips! ]...we met Lloyd, Tall Paul and Kris there, before we all popped along to the Rossmore Leisure Centre for our weekly dose of 5-a-side. That hall is like a sauna...we sweated buckets! I scored four goals tonight I think...including a right foot curler into the far corner and a SPECTACULAR left foot screamer! We still lost though!  Back to the Harvester for a couple of drinks...then back home.  I am now a very tired bunny! Its 12.45am and I need sleep. We are in Bournemouth tomorrow night for Matt Burts' stag night...having a meal before having a few drinks. A rumour is that we will then go to For Your Eyes Only...a local strip club! Not sure the funds will expand to that...but we'll see!  So...signing out for today...maybe see some feedback soon!

        An inspired title for the next instalment eh??   I'm still not sure who I am writing this for...I know at least one person has read what I wrote yesterday though! If you are here, reading this and you are not me, then I'd love it if you left some comments ok! I spose that if no-one ever does, then it might be interesting for me to look back at in the future though...  Well...the big news yesterday was that my windscreen was fixed! It only took nearly two weeks but we got there in the end. It saved me cleaning it anyway...although that is a bit extreme as a continued policy I think.  Didn't actually get up to much yesterday apart from that...well, having to wait in for windscreen man scuppered any hopes of actually leaving the building! I ended up waffling on MSN for ages and then caught up on my Pheonix Nights Series One DVD..surely one of the funniest series ever shown on telly?  I was planning to go to Salisbury today with Mum...we always enjoy going there, it makes a nice change. She just rung and said it was too hot for her to start walking around there though, so we are going to Poole instead...with its air conditioned shopping centre and plenty of cafes for her to sit down at! Never mind, it should be nice to see her again anyway...I only get to shop with her when I'm off work.   So...I better get me arse in gear...she is picking me up in five minutes! Wonder what I'll end up buying today....!!

        I am not sure how often I will write here...we all start with good intentions! It may well be that I am writing to myself anyway! I am hoping that a few of my friends will pop along every so often and if by some miracle, people I have never met before come along too, that'll be great.  Today is Tuesday 8th June 2004 and it is just after 2pm...2.11pm to be exact! The weather is beautiful and has been for a week or so now. Not sure how long it'll keep up as it usually rains when I'm off work! I really should be doing something good today but its almost too hot to do housework. I am waiting in because I am getting my car windscreen replaced today....I hope! A long story but I have waited nearly two weeks for it to happen now...it has been passed from Salisbury to Bournemouth Autoglass and back again. They said they'd be here this afternoon, so here fingers crossed.  I might just start to sort out my spare room in a bit though. I want to do some CDs up as well though...make a compilation for the car. I have so many new CDs [ nothing new there then ] that I should put all the best bits on one disc really. I also have to de-flea the cat! She wont like that...claws will be out!   I really need my arse kicking sometimes though...the place needs a big clear out. I am a hoarder...I don't mind saying. Our family always has been! My flat is lovely but its too compact to keep too much in. I need to get some black bags and just throw out what I don't need. I have mountains of clothes that I never wear any more too. Come one Dave...arse in gear ok!  I am off to Salisbury tomorrow with my Mum. I don't see her that often as she is always galivanting [sp?] around the country in her state of the art caravan! So tomorrow will be nice. We like Salisbury...it has some nice shops. Not sure I actually need to buy anything though! Then it will be dinner at hers in the evening....my only decent home cooked meal of the week usually! My brother Phil and his soon-to-be wife, Sam, also pop up...so its a nice place to get together really.  Not sure what else I will get up to this week....my 'friend' is going to pop round at some point, probably Thursday morning...so that'll be nice! I really fancy another tattoo this week as well. For those that don't know, I have six tatts. Three on the right lower leg and three on my left arm. I want an AFC Bournemouth one....but maybe more subtle than just the badge! I might pop to Weymouth on Friday to see if I can adapt something they have.  Saturday night sees the lads on a stag night in Bournemouth for one of the footy team. He is about as exciting as me though, so I doubt too many mad things will be happening! Might also be helping a female friend from work move house in the morning...  As you can see, my life isn't that great...but it is better than some I suppose! More waffle will follow!

         As I said in the brief introduction above, I'm not sure if this is a good idea or a bad one! My name is Dave and I live in Dorset. I am 36 years old but look much younger! I am single at the moment but have someone that I 'see' occasionally. I work for Fitness First in Poole. They are a huge chain of health clubs and have clubs all over the world.  Before that, I worked for Tesco for over eight years. I made some nice friends there and even had my main three relationships with people that either worked there or shopped there!  My main interest is probably football, closely followed by music. My only real vice is buying CDs and I usually get 3/4 a month at least. I now have hundreds and hundreds around the flat! I support AFC Bournemouth and have done since I was their first ever official matchday mascot back in the early 70s! My two 'big clubs' are Liverpool and Glasgow Celtic. I recently realised a lifelong ambition by going to Parkhead to see the Mighty Hoops play. Apart from that, I also enjoy films, eating out and a nice night out at a quiet pub!  I also run a Sunday League team; Blandford HMR FC.  We have been going for three years now and have just gained promotion to Division One of the Dorset Sunday League. Yay me!  I live in the centre of town, in a two bedroom groundfloor flat, that I bought with my ex-fiancee. Best thing she ever did for me! It's just me and my cat Mini now though.   I drive a new Mini Cooper and it's a great car....always been a dream to buy a brand new car and I was able to last year. Might be the only time I ever do it!  Anyway...that is the introduction. I hope to write loads more...it might only ever be read by me though I guess! If anyone does ever come along though, I would love feedback. I have a few big events happening this year: my brothers wedding [ I am Best Man ]; his stag weekend in Blackpool; my appearance at the Home of Football, the Theatre Of Dreams, Dean Court aka the Fitness First Stadium...home of AFC Bournemouth, in a Fitness First challenge match; trying to get a team together that is good enough for division one on a Sunday!   I hope that at least a few people keep in touch!  Thankyou.
