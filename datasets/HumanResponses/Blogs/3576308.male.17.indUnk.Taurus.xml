      My friend that I havent seen in 4 years just slept over, it was fun.  Nothing really exciting happened but it was cool.  Im going to Marthas Vineyard tomorrow with Nick, that should be fun too.  Hes coming over now, he should be here any minute.  By the way, I decided to completely drop the Alicia thing no matter what immature commant she makes or even if she bitches at me online.  It was kind of pathetic how she wouldnt drop it, I broke up with her because I didnt want to deal with her any more, and thats what Im doing now.  I think Nicks here, gotta go.

      I spent the last 2 days at Russells house playing his awesome new game and eating.  Nick slept over too on the second day.  We stayed up till 3:30am playing the game without Russell and now our characters are better than his.  But mines still twice as good as Nicks cause I stayed up till 2:30 the night before playing it.  Today should be interesting, my friend who moved to one of the Carolinas and who I havent seen in 3 or 4 years is coming over.

      This Alicia thing is getting ridiculous.  I tried to drop her many times but she wont stop IMing me and leaving annoying comments (yes I know I leave comments too but Ill explain) on my blog.  Ok first, I make it a point to only respond to her annoying, pointless comments, meaning I never start the arguements.  Second, I remain calm all the time and never say the things that she does like "I own you bitch!" or "Have a horrible day and I hope a raincloud follows you for the rest of your life and may all the gods smite you!" or "Youre a queer! Youre gay!"  Third, she and everyone tells me not to leave comments on her blog thing and I respect other people so I dont.  Then, oh whats this? She left another comment on mine, ok now people will get mad at me when I respond.  Thats really not right.  So to sum it all up, Im being far more mature about this than she is and Im not at fault.  Yes I respond to what she says but she says the first thing which starts everything.  And yes I also know that everyone hates when I say Im right, but hey, this whole post just proved it.  I think I know why everyone hates when I say Im right, its because I say it all the time.  But I only say it when Im talking about this situation and I just talk about it a lot.  I hope everyone (besides alicia) can take a minute to just think about what I said cause for some reason everyone seems to be inclined to protect her even though she does all these things and I dont say anything too bad, or swear, or yell.  Think about it.

      Went to my grandfathers house for fathers day on Saturday cause we were saving today for my dad, then today we went to the beach cause thats what he likes to do.  I usually hate the beach but I was wearing a few pairs of sunglasses to protect my vampire eyes so today was ok.  Plus the water was freezing so thats always good.  I played chess with my dad for different bets and I had to run into the freezing ocean and go underwater, and leave my many sunglasses off for a whole damn minute.  But I won one so we left early.  I got a tan so i guess the beach is ok once in a while even though its extremely bright.  4 days till MV woo hoo!

      Missed the but after finals friday, either it never came or it did and I didnt see it.  So I went to Kenny's until like 3 when my mom picked me up.  Thursday I drove Nick and Kenny to my house even though I'm only allowed to drive one person, so my mom said I cant drive all weekend.  Thats ok though cause I have to go to boston today, and do father's day shiat tomorrow.  I wish I didnt have to though cause Russell wants me to go to his boat.  I want to go too but my dad will overpower us all with his massive muscles.

      Math and History finals today.  Both were easier than I expected, especially history.  For some reason I just thought the word history said Harry Potter, ha what a retard.  Anyway, at the end of the history exam she wanted us to fill out an evaluation of the class and i wrote wicked funny shiat on it.  The last question said "Anything else I need to know???" and i wrote "Yes, only one question mark is necessary.  Also, it doesnt motivate me when I get threatened by you three times in one minute.  Theyre not even normal teacher threats like 'If you hand that in late I'm marking it as a zero.'  No, theyre 'Medrek I'm gonna kill you' and 'How about I shove that drawing down your throat.'"  A different question said "What could have, and has helped you learn better in my class" Or something, and I wrote "Movies, cake, cough substitute teacher cough, not sending me out of the room when I ask to go to the library. 'Why should I let you go to the library when you havent done any other work on this project?  Get out of my room! How dare you offer to work!'  How about because I'll actually work in the library where Im not getting yelled at or threatened with death.  But apparently it's more beneficial to you if I don't get my work done."  I also yelled at her about failing one of Russells essays because she couldnt understand his intelligent dialog and constantly making us take notes that I dont take anyway.  It was pretty funny.

      Finals today: English and Banking.  English was entirely essays.  7 of them.  My hand hurts.  Nothing much happened today, just pissed off Malley again by stealing her giant rubber band and shooting it at gleason... and a few chinese footballs.  Ok, now I nead whoever reads this to tell me what they think of these names for Halo:  Atlas, The Great Gunner, Catalyst, and Hyde.

      Last real day of school! There are still finals though so its far from over.  Went to Nicks after school today, we wached The Last Samurai and part of Catch Me If You Can.  The Last Samurai was really good, Nick fell asleep right before the final war.  When we got to his house he took off his shirt and Im like "uhh Nick..."  and hes like "Im doin what I do" so he was like that the whole time and it was disturbing.  Especially because I just got a pen that electrocutes you when you press it and he was shocking his nipple.  People all day in school were asking me if they could shock themselves.  I was like "ok just dont throw it" then theyre like "it hurts that much?" "yep" "ok Ill do it anyway"  then they press it and throw it wicked far "sorry i couldnt hold on to it" "i know"  then they did it again.  it was like that for just about every class.  In accounting Brink wanted to try it but he was afraid so he kept pacing around and he said he would do it when the second hand hit the 12, it would be like a suicide.  I think I'll have some fun with this, i know a place that if you shock it, either your heart stops or you have a seizure or you just twitch and hurt a lot. ();^)

      Riddick was way better than I thought it would be, usually I dont like Vin Diesel.  After the movie, Nick and Dave slept over and we played Halo, watched us some TV and ate everything.  In the morning we all (including Russell) went to Russells yacht.  I drove with Russell and when he gets lazy he has me steer, he doesnt even have to say anything anymore I just know when.  Its fun cause he can reach for stuff in the back seat or not look and I just tell him "gas" or "brake" or "OH MY GOD WE'RE GONNA DIE".  At the yacht we all sat on the front of it with the huge waves that almost knocked us off.  We were wrestling too, and we can easily slide overboard under the railings.  After the little cruise thing we went to the movies and saw Harry Potter 3 which was good.  Then my overprotective parents didnt let me sleep over at the boat because they felt like being extra gay.  I just got back and went to bed because thursday, I slept over Nicks and didnt get much sleep, and friday they all slept over and we didnt get much sleep again, so I didnt mind having to come home as much as I could have.  I'm still pissed at how overprotective my parents are though.  So are Nick Russell and Dave because since I couldnt sleep over, they couldnt either. I still dont know what Alcias problem is this time, she didnt respond to my comment yet, and I dont know what Rachel thinks about our whole fight thing because she doesnt respond to my comments either.  All I know is shes always pissed.

      School is getting old, I cant wait for it to end.  Then I dont have to see certain people, and I can see certain others more.  Nick and I are going to Martha's Vineyard for a week... again.  That should be awesome... again.  (tensions were not rising Nick, you just felt you had to defend that other kid who isnt going this time so it will be pure.......good).  Yes, I'm articulate (no).    Well, Russell kidnapped me again.  This time we broke the law a little more.  And by we I mean I.  First, we were supposed to go to the gas station for food right down the street but we ended up going to Nicks, then on the way back he kept missing streets again.  We went down a residential area where he was going way faster than he should have been going because he didnt want me to jump out of the car.  I was being kidnapped so I had my seatbelt off and the door open, then he went around a small culdesac at 25 mph and I almost fell out of the car.  He went around it twice with my door open.  Then we were going back up that street and I was trying to jump out the sunroof.  He didnt think I was actually going to so he jerked the wheel as I pretended to jump, so my feet came off the middle of the seats and I almost rolled out of the sunroof.  That happened as a cop car went by.  I obviously didnt have a seat belt on and I was more than halfway out of the roof.  Then I held some wrappers out the window threatening to litter if we didnt go back to my house, and I accidently dropped them as Russell jerked the wheel again... all right in front of two more parked squad cars.    I'm looking forward to more of this in the summer which should be awesome as long as its not hot.  Next year should be great because Nick is in at least two of my classes, and I'll never see Rachel again after next week because she's not in any of them.  By the way, both Russell and Nick gave me points for tellig them something that happened on The Simpsons.  Ralph was drawiing, then the teacher took the paper and said with a sad look "Ralph, Jesus doesn't have wheels" By the way, I'm going to see The Chronicles of Riddick with Dave Nick Russell and Jason, but I want to see the Prisoner of Azkaban cause I havent seen it yet.  I guess we'll flip a coin or something according to Dave, or vote which seems like the more logical thing to do.  I hope theyre both good anyway. Thats all for now I'm wasting my Friday, I should be at Seans, later yall... I'm sorry, I'll never say that again.

      School was ok today for once.  I didn't come home with a new scar, bruise or cut from Rachel like I always do, and since she was apparently ignoring me I didn't get bitched at either so that makes me happy.  After school I went to some Finance Academy meeting which was pointless because they haven't found me an employer yet.  At least I got to hang out with everybody which makes it not pointless.  After that I went back to Nicks house where I still am because I'm sleeping over.  Yes, I'm sleeping over on a weekday I'm a weird kid.  We just atched some TV: Conan (which is becoming the best show), Seinfeld, and The Simpsons.  We did some other stuff too but I didn't pay enough attention to remember what they are, he got points though.  We just decided to pull an all-nighter so I'll be kinda tired tomorrow... although I have gone 3 nights in a row without sleep once.  Well, Nicks telling me to get off so he can blog, so good day to you all, except three (I'm on a roll).

      Its so hot, I went to Russells after school and we played with swords and had those colored ice long things I dont know what theyre called (too hot to think).  Then we went down to his music room and I spilled pepsi all over the electrical equipment, then on my way out to get paper towels I tripped over a music stand and bent it.  Then we went to my house.  As we approached my street he said "Oh by the way, I'm kidnaping you" and passed my street.  We then went past every street that leads back to my house and went down all the wrong ones.  We went in a huge circle and we were approaching my street again and I could see he was going to pass it again so I took the wheel to try to turn the car onto my street but we just went off the road a few feet.  After going down more streets we finally got to mine but Russell turned to go around the circle the long way.  He tried to turn onto another street so I held the wheel in place after he turned it to try to steer it into a driveway, but the car just ran over a huge rock and drove into the guys yard while he was outside watching.

      Wow... I'm a little stunned right now, I dont know whats going on.  Drew just randomly IMed me yelling at me about when I left Alcias house like 3 or 4 weeks ago which doesn't have to do with anything, and he said I was begging Nick to come over after that when I called him once and asked if he wanted to do anything when he got back.  Even if he wasn't wrong, what would be his point?  As if that wasn't surprising enough, after that, I tried to ask Rachel what Drew's problem was and she said "Don't f***ing lecture me about Drew, I don't care what you say anymore"..... wow. Ok I don't know what's going on, but apparently they both hate me.  They both say I always have to be right, and of course they're gonna have the same opinion, but neither of them can give me an example.  Drew says I always have to be right when he talks about things he couldnt possibly know about.  Those things happen to me, yet he still thinks he knows more than I do about them for some reason.  For example (yeah I actually have an example), Drew says that the fact that I have no emotions is rediculous.  In truth, something happened when I was 11 and its a real condition, but ok Drew you must know more than I do (retard).  Another example is that he and Rachel think its me that has been posting comments on Alicias blog thing.  Wrong again, I'm the one that would know so yes of course I am going to think that I'm right.  Rachel and Drew are getting to be more trouble than they're worth so screw them both.  All Rachel does is smack me, stab me with things (I have scars to prove it), and yell at me about everything possible.  And all Drew does is be suspicious of everything I say.  I don't care though, they have never done anything fun anyway.  I know who my real friends are.

      I had to add this before I forget.  I was just watching the best show besides the Simpsons (Conan O'brien).  Ok so Conan was talking then he waved his hand and spilled his coffee all over the floor and hes like "Whoa, that was really embarrasing, I hope nobody saw that"  Then a breaking news flash came on and said "We interrupt this show to tell you that just moments ago, Comedy Central's Conan O'Brien has just spilled a cup of coffee" After that was said, Conan was sitting there being interviewed be a reporter. I dont know if you had to be there but its still wicked funny to me.

      My first blog, hmm what to say what to say... I could just ramble on like Nick does about his cat, but my dog is sleeping so its not gonna walk across my screen.  As you probably found out I stayed home today, I'm not that sick but we're watching movies in 3 classes today so i'm not gonna bother going. I watched Jerry Springer, which is actually on again in an hour.  So yes, about all this b'otchy stuff going on lately: YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE better not talk to me again because every time you do, this huge fight starts which I win anyway because I cant get hurt. I know nobody wants to talk about this so I'll stop now. Wow I just realized how lazy I am.  I'm getting worn out holding down the shift button to capitalize letters.  Oh well, it looks more presentable this way. I just learned how to play Hot Stuff on my keyboard, we played that in band freshman year and its been stuck in my head ever since. Yeah... nothing else to talk about just waiting for... something to happen.  Good day to you all (except one).

      I just got back from my uncle's new house and apparently everyone went to the movies.  I wasn't invited as usual.  Also Russell and Kenny just called me to get Nick's number so they could invite him over Russells house too.  They didn't ask me to go even though they called me for Nick's number.  To me, that is a strong hints that they don't want me around.  Nick also complains that he doesn't have anyone to hang around with but he never tries to call me, ever.  Well I'm taking the hints and I guess I won't try to get together with anyone anymore, screw you guys I don't need this.  I'll find some actual friends.

      Work was ok today except I got the worst paper cut by far of my entire life.  Blood was flowing out pretty fast and its over an inch long and 4 millimeters deep.  I measured how deep it was by how high the blood was on the paper.  Thats pretty damn deep for a paper cut.  I've gotten at least 10 paper cuts since I started working there but none nearly as bad as this, and I think I'm getting addicted to them.  Whenever I get a new one I feel kind of refreshed like I've gone too long without one.  Its kind of weird.  Anyway I went to Russells house after work and we tried to find a pawn shop, but the only one had apparently turned into a bike shop.  I was gonna try to buy some kind of weapon or something.  So yeah someone at my work called her house and her 5 year old daughter answered the phone so she said "Hi honey can I talk to daddy?" then apparently the kid started laughing so she said "Well you're little miss giggles today aren't you?  OH SHIT!" as her coffee spilled all over her lap and her daughter started crying.

      I don't know if anyone else noticed but Nick is acting weird lately like he's trying to improve himself or something and he's trying too hard.&nbsp; This will show you what I mean:   NSFonEVERYONE: I doubt highly that they even have an opinion.  NSFonEVERYONE: Dave enjoys it.  EVILeye1315: whatever, im trying to save you&nbsp;some&nbsp;embarrasment  NSFonEVERYONE: From what? It is a code of honor, to live by it would surely deem one of great prestige.  EVILeye1315: youre weird lately, like youre trying to pretend to be better EVILeye1315: or trying too hard.&nbsp; It really is a stupid away message, its not a big deal though Im just saying NSFonEVERYONE: I was going to say something that was very long but I got lazy half way through and I&nbsp;don't care what you think&nbsp;anymore.  EVILeye1315: ok  EVILeye1315: it&nbsp;just seems like&nbsp;youre trying too hard&nbsp;to speak and/or be better&nbsp;and you dont sound too&nbsp;straight, thats all im saying, not that youre not straight  NSFonEVERYONE: And the reasons my hate for you stack up higher.  NSFonEVERYONE: I'm not trying to do anything, and you are an ignorant fool&nbsp;if you&nbsp;believe that my sexuality is in question due to an away message&nbsp;that&nbsp;I posess.  EVILeye1315: shut the fuck up, Ive been trying to have a conversation not insult you, theres no reason for that.&nbsp; I&nbsp;said you sound gay not you are gay you "ignorant fool".&nbsp; think before you call an intellectual superior a fool because there's usually, and is in this case,&nbsp;something youve overlooked.&nbsp; NEVER CALL ME THAT AGAIN  EVILeye1315: you have a real problem lately with your attitude, you seem to think you can say whatever you like and there wont be consequences NSFonEVERYONE: I refuse to speak to you hence forth.  EVILeye1315: allow me (block)  NSFonEVERYONE signed off at 10:50:02 PM.   He seems to be trying to use flowery language and/or enhanced morals lately and apparently he tried to shove it in my face when I suggested he change his away message&nbsp;and I'm not one to be pushed around.&nbsp; Its hard to concentrate on writing angry blogs when I'm listening to Play That Funky Music White Boy.&nbsp; Bow chicka beng beng...

      Ok my boss wants me to temporarily&nbsp;take the place of the person who quit until she can find someone else, which means I'll be in charge of accounts payable (bills, taxes, and&nbsp;money and other&nbsp;stuff owed to&nbsp;different companies).&nbsp; Lol during the school's interview I specifically asked not to be in an accounting department and now I'm the head of A/P for 11 different companies.&nbsp; Oh yeah I'm also in charge of payroll for those 11 companies&nbsp;so I can mess up and give someone $10,000 instead of $1000 or $1 instead of... I dont know, $256.&nbsp; Yeah I'm pretty important now, the only people who are above me out of all 11 companies&nbsp;are my boss (her title is&nbsp;the controller)&nbsp;and the two&nbsp;owners.&nbsp; I think I may have underlings but I'm not sure yet.&nbsp; This is only tuesday of my 3rd week, talk about pressure.&nbsp; I have to stay late like real&nbsp;managers if I don't get everything done and I can come in early, but I'll adjust to all this money I'm earning.&nbsp; Well, time to take senior pictures.

      I accidently did something evil today.&nbsp; One of my co-workers was making fun of me (jokingly) by saying that when she's retired I'll still be working.&nbsp; Well, she overdid the joke and I got tired of it so I said "Yeah but when   I'm   retired you'll be dead!"&nbsp; then a couple hours later she announced that she was quitting.&nbsp; Oops.  But now my boss wants me to work extra hours during the day and she's going to train me to do what the other person was doing.&nbsp; Yeah that's fair, I'll still be making $7.50 an hour doing something thats worth like $35 or more&nbsp;an hour.&nbsp; Now I have to think of a polite way to express my revulsion at her existence (citation: Russell, points page) also find a plite way to say "Bwa ha ha ha! ...*tries to surpress laughing*...*snort* ha ha ha ha!"&nbsp; but I don't know how.

      I don't post as much as I did when I first started for some reason.&nbsp; Probably lazy.&nbsp; Anyway I went to Russell's boat yesterday and I had to bring a radio with batteries cause his car doesn't have a CD player.&nbsp; Its from like 1985 I think.&nbsp; Anyway, we went there for a few hours then came back at like 3:30&nbsp;cause nothing was happening.&nbsp; Then The&nbsp;Sean came over and we played Champions of Norrath, we kinda cheated,&nbsp;and ate&nbsp;until 1:19AM when he realized he had hockey in the morning, so we had to go to sleep.&nbsp; Anyway whats in the news today... oh yeah there's this wicked hard piano song I'm trying to figure out.&nbsp; It's The Blue Channel by Taking Back Sunday.&nbsp; I want to be able to play the first like 10 seconds of it cause the rest sucks.&nbsp; What else... oh yeah,&nbsp;Nick's being a little bitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;Random little things set him off and it pisses me off.&nbsp; He got wicked&nbsp;mad because I joked that he knew me longer and he's still letting Drew stay over his house and not me.&nbsp; I knew that Drew had to for convenience so I was just kidding and he exploded and signed off for a minute then signed on and started bitching his ass off at me.&nbsp; Even if&nbsp;I wasn't kidding what's the big deal??&nbsp; Before that, I was over his house helping him make yard sale signs and he said its up to me if I wanted to sleep over his house friday night so I could go to the yard sale.&nbsp; So I said I would and I went home and got online then he IMs me and says "You're not sleeping over.&nbsp; I don't know where you got that idea."&nbsp; I was like ...ok.&nbsp; I don't really&nbsp;care what he thinks when he gets like that because he usually tries to appoligize for it later, but its getting ridiculous HOW ABOUT NOT DOING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE?!&nbsp; Anyway, at least I've been bonding with Rachel after that whole huge fight between everyone.&nbsp; I think we're better friends now than before which is good.&nbsp; Drew seems to not be pissed either even though I deserved what I got for not realizing that people, espesially Rachel, take things upon themselves and try to resolve them and it gets stressful for them.&nbsp; I didn't know that you guys did that&nbsp;so to everyone who got involved (especially Rachel and Drew), except you know who,&nbsp;I'm sorry.

      Work is getting more boring each day.&nbsp; I get to do cool manager type stuff sometimes but mostly I just&nbsp;scan papers onto the computer.&nbsp; It's a lot better than Shaws and I get paid more but its really boring.&nbsp; Oh well its not like I'm gonna quit.&nbsp; I had to ride my bike home today cause I didn't have a ride, then Russell picked me up and after dropping something back off at work we went to Mobile, his house, then the movies to see Spiderman 2.&nbsp; We were going to see I, Robot again but we didn't think it would be as good the second time because most of the movie is trying to find out who killed the guy and what happens next.&nbsp; After the movie Russell drove me home but halfway there his car... broke I guess.&nbsp; It felt like we were going over a bump, then the car would suddenly speed up or slow down.&nbsp; That happened about once a second, I think it was changing gears and the brake pressure was going crazy.&nbsp; But then Russell had an idea to pull into a parking lot and turn the car off then back on.&nbsp; I was like "Russell you know this isn't gonna help, this is a transmission problem" but guess what, it worked.&nbsp; The engine must not have turned all the way over or something.&nbsp; That was his guess.&nbsp;   I'm curious about who reads this so if everyone who does&nbsp;could leave a comment then that would be nice.&nbsp; It doesn't even matter if I know you, even if you have my screen name and we don't talk it doesn't matter.&nbsp; If you don't have a screen name to leave a comment just post anonymously and leave your name.&nbsp;

      For anyone who doesn't already know, I've just about lost touch with reality and I believe just about anything is possible through some kind of molecular manipulation or extreme will and concentration.&nbsp; I don't hallucinate though, and last night I could see through my eyelids.&nbsp; It only works in extreme darkness and I see outlines of things, its pretty cool.&nbsp; I really don't care who believes that (no one)&nbsp;and who doesn't (everyone), but a few years ago I heard of someone else who could do that and I've been working on it for a while so baym.&nbsp; Also, as soon as I'm over&nbsp;18 and rich I'm going to have red contacts, a&nbsp;black trenchcoat with 2 swords sheathed hidden in it, a shotgun&nbsp;in a sling on my back, a sniper rifle in a sling on the other half of my back, full body bullet proof armor, possibly&nbsp;chainmail for looks, cool looking full finger armor, and black clothes with bright silver chains wrapped around them and maybe a cape unless it looks gay.&nbsp; I'll probably do that after I've joined a SWAT team and everyone thinks that's normal for me to wear.&nbsp; Like Russell with his weird clothes in school except more extreme and more dangerous.&nbsp; Weird huh?&nbsp; Oh yeah and I'll have a secret room in my house that holds all this stuff and maybe a pool table.&nbsp; Don't worry I haven't gone insane, I've been planning this for years I just decided to say it now cause I'm bored and waiting for Sean to get here.&nbsp; Anyone who wants to join me in this is more than welcome... except for people who aren't skilled with any&nbsp;weapons.&nbsp; If you're bad with swords thats ok you'll just&nbsp;have more guns and maybe grenades.&nbsp; Sean and Russell are&nbsp;already being&nbsp;snipers&nbsp;with me and even if we don't go use this craziness on the job we can probably just wear it to stores and rob them (just kidding&nbsp; (or am I))&nbsp;or be super heroes or something.&nbsp; Or just look cool.&nbsp; Now then, anyone who's in shock feel free to vent in my comments section.&nbsp; Dave will most likely be the most freaked/pissed.

      After work friday I hung around my house for a while then went to Russell's with Nick Dave and Jason.&nbsp; We went to Victory and Nick bought some balloons and asked a sexy girl who worked there to fill them.&nbsp; I can't do stupid things around sexy women so I had to wait outside with Russell and Jason.&nbsp; Nick says he doesn't get embarrased around women anymore but I do.&nbsp; We went back to Russells and Nick and Dave sucked the helium out of them and sang but Daves voice didn't change at all so he just sang in a high voice.&nbsp; Today Nick Dave and I went to see I, Robot and it was awesome.&nbsp; Nick wanted to see Anchorman again but he saw it twice so we saw this one.&nbsp; Nick wants robotic arms now.&nbsp; Whenever we see a cool movie, Nick wants something from it.&nbsp; After we saw Riddick he wanted eyes that see in the dark, after we saw Anchorman he wanted to be "the balls", after Spiderman 2 he wanted Doc Ock arms.&nbsp; I think after we saw Dawn of the Dead he even wanted to be Jay Leno so he could get shot in the head.&nbsp; It was either that or he wanted to be a zombie so he could be dead and walk funny.&nbsp; Anyway I, Robot was an awesome movie and it had a preview of another movie that looks good too&nbsp;but I forget what it is.&nbsp; Oh well, I'll wake up in the middle of the night and remember what it is.&nbsp; Oh yeah and I almost gave Nick points for saying "Hey big mama, wanna pay my dues?"&nbsp; and singing"Dirty deeds and my cock is big"&nbsp; If you think he should get points for one or both of those then leave a comment and theres a slight possibility of a chance that I might consider thinking about changing my mind.&nbsp; Good luck with those odds.

      My company is having a cookout on friday and my boss wants everyone to bring something but I don't want to go.  I would rather sit in my cubicle and do a bunch of classified stuff, but I can't argue so I'll just bring some hot dog buns or something.  I need something to do after work (I get home at 2:30) so call me if you want to do anything.

      I love my internship.  I work directly for the "controller" so I get to see all this confidential stuff.  My first day she had me do a bunch of reports that said how much the company is making and she even had me fire someone.  Then on my second day she had me figure out how much money all the managers got in bonuses.  She didn't check my work after she only looked at it to see if it looked right so I could have messed up and screwed them for thousands of dollars.  But I didn't... I hope.

      I just went to where I'm having my internship (Verani Realty) and met my employers.  My boss is nice, she seems friendly and stuff but I was kinda scared because the owners of the company were there and they weren't supposed to be.  I had to meet them and they're these big important millionaires and they're my boss's bosses.  That's hard to say.  I start work on monday 9 - 2.  I'll be a secretary the first day, moving boxes the second day and filing papers the third day.  Fun.  Oh well at least I'm making money which I need because I just blew $110 on a broken PS2.  When I'm done working I should have about another $1100 so I'll have close to $2000.  Or over, I don't know how much money I have.  For those of you who think my points are pointless, there's a prize thing for who has the most at the end of senior year.  Just had to add that, now to watch Jerry Springer.

      I've been so bored the past few days, I went to Russell's yacht over the weekend but thats about it.  I've been living off The Simpsons, Seinfeld, Conan and Jerry Springer.  I need something to do so if you want to do something call me.   Shit.  I just remembered Justin's dead.  That really sucks, I knew him very well from 7th grade.  Freshman year we were in band together and we pissed off Soucy (the teacher) by trying to play each other's instruments and failing.  When we played at football games we would sit together in the stands even though the sax's were supposed to be in a different section than the trumpets.  We had so many inside jokes, and hes the one that introduced me to Office Space.  *sigh*        We were in the same English class too.  We started the year by talking constantly and the teacher (Mr. McCune) moved us to opposite sides of the room, but we just made hand signals of our inside jokes and laughed louder than we would have talked.  Either that or we would just talk louder.  As time went by McCune accepted it and we actually became kind of friendly with him because he thought our conversations were hillarious and he let us sit together.        We hung out outside of school too.  We went to the skate park and he tried to teach me how to skateboard.  Also if anyone has heard my scilence-breaking story, we made that up in band.  It goes "So I was sitting there, right, watching TV, and Justin walks in and starts making a ham sandwitch.  Im like 'Man what the hell are you doing in my house?'  Hes like '...Dude this is  my  house.'  And I'm like 'Oh yeah'  So I get up and leave"  Im sure a lot of people have heard me say that randomly.      Thanks for everything man, you won't be forgotten.

      9am and I have to leave for my grandmothers soon.  I think its for the 4th of july but its only gonna be my grandmother, my family and one of my cousins families.  I have 13 cousins on my dads side so you would think more people were going cause they usually do.  Whatever, I have to sleep over there anyway so it might be better that I dont have to deal with them for 2 days.  They're all wicked cool for their age though.  They range from age 1 to 16, lets see if I can name all the cousins.  Jessica Austin Sarah Katie Kevin Joel Jack Renee Jamie Devin Emily then me and my brother.  Whew thats a lot of words.  Anyway I just bought a PS2 and Champions of Norrath for a total of $130 on eBay and I think a new PS2 is 200, Im not sure though.  I got a good deal anyway.  Thats the game that Nick and I played in our free time in Marthas Vineyard, we'll see how long Im obsessed with it.  The last game, I was obsessed with it for a total of 1200 hours.  Thats how many I put into the game (PSO).  The runner up is runescape but that doesnt tell you how many hours so I guess I played it for a few hours a day for at least 5 months.  Yes yes its sad but now Im so used to doing things other than staying home that I wont be able to sit and play it all day.  Just for a week cause Seans in Maine, Russell has summer school and I just spent a week with Nick so he might want to give it a rest for a few days.  Thats convenient.

      Me and Nick just got back from Marthas Vineyard and I have like 7 fun-dips that I ripped off some lady.  We were at some arcade and I had enough tickets for 3 but the lady messed up on her calculator so I got 5 extra and some more stuff.  I knew, but arcades are a rip off anyway so I didnt say anything.  Overall it was awesome.  We swam in the pool, went to the beach, played tennis, minni-golfed, Nick got stung by a bee, I got a ton of points from Nick, and we played a fun Playstation game when there was nothing else to do.  Except sleep, we didnt do much of that.               By the way, Drew or Rachel if you want my Runescape guy he's yours (no Im not gonna make you give me money like you did), I dont use it anymore so hes yours if you like.

      Apparently everyone went to Russell's again on Sunday.  Russell and Dave didn't know I was pissed so they were being their normal selves not inviting me, and Nick knew I was pissed but he either didn't care that calling me would have helped or forgot about me again.  That puts a cap on the whole thing, this will be my last post for obvious reasons.
