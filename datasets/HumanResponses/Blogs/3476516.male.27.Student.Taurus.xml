       urlLink    Well its a holiday, Memorial Weekend. Had a BBQ outside of my building with what few residents were left here on campus. Had lots of food, about  $75 worth, only lasted an hour and a half. BBQ food makes people full real quick, and also wanted to get packing before it might rain.  &nbsp; urlLink

      Well I was told about a week ago that I wasn't going to get paid over the summer for doing the mail, which gets me mad, now I got to find a job that is flexible and starting this late. If I don't find a job and money starts to run out then I will leave this campus earlier then planned and probably earlier then my bosses would like. Heck its not my fault that they want to tell me that I will not get paid, and they still want me to do the mail, Ha. So for now the mail is not being done on a regular consistency since I have other more important things to do. Like finding a job, and getting my thesis done and the TicTacToe program that uses Reinforcement learning concepts to run which will be used in my presentation defense of my Thesis. Anyway I will try searching for a job first on campus hoping that the following areas will also need a temp service postition also:  urlLink SUNY Institute of Technology - Financial Aid   If no place on campus will do then I will try Walmart and Bestbuy or a paid intership next.

       urlLink Home - Center for American Progress    This is probably one of the best sites I have seen that discusses political issues. They are obviously left wing, but they back up all their information with facts that you can easily checkout since they link them to the original sites. Most of them link to the white house goverment sites, New York Times, and Washington Times.   I get their week-day newsletters via email that shows a ton of information on how the pervious day, the bush administration obviously lies (constantly even I notice the lies) and gives proof of their contradictions.   Today they discussed the long battle the right-wing conseratives are having on trying to shut down Michael Moores new film.  Here it is (very long):  "Today is the nationwide premiere of Michael Moore's new movie "Fahrenheit 9/11" -- an analysis of how the president misled the country to war in Iraq and how the Bush-Saudi relationship has compromised America's national security. Even before the movie was public, the White House and its right-wing allies sought to smear both the film and Moore personally. Last month, White House communications director Dan Bartlett said the movie "was  so outrageously false   (http://www.ohio.com/mld/ohio/2004/05/25/news/ editorial/8753292.htm?1c)    it's not even worth comment," even though he had not yet seen the film. Meanwhile, the Hollywood Reporter discovered that " big-time conservative donors  (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display. jsp?vnu_content_id=1000552469) "   are funding a slew of anti-Moore activities. Following the White House's tactic of  attacking critics' patriotism   (http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&b=10955)   , the right-wing is also apparently bankrolling a movie called "Michael Moore Hates America." But despite conservatives' best efforts to discredit the film, the NY Times notes, " central assertions of fact in 'Fahrenheit 9/11' are supported by the public record   (http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/movies/20SHEN.html?ex=1088308800&en=05f2b88c69444954&ei=5062&partner=GOOGLE)   ." When the movie was aired at the Cannes Film Festival, it won  top prize   (http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/movies/23canne.html)    from a panel made up of mostly American and British judges.    ACCURATE -- NEW REPORT SAYS SAUDI FLIGHTS OCCURRED ON 9/13: Critics have accused Moore of wrongly claiming a group of Saudis were allowed to fly out of the United States on September 13, when much of American airspace was still closed. In fact, the  movie accurately reports   (http://www.michaelmoore.com/mustread/f911facts/isikoff.php)    that 142 Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, were allowed to leave after September 13 -- a fact well documented by the  9/11 Commission   (http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing10/staff_ statement_10.pdf)   . Additionally, new reports prove that  Saudi flights did occur on 9/13   (http://www.sptimes.com/2004/06/09/Tampabay/TIA_now_ verifies_flig.shtml)   , despite three years of Bush administration denials. As the St. Petersburg Times reports, on September 13,"with most of the nation's air traffic still grounded, a small jet landed at Tampa International Airport, picked up three young Saudi men and left" for Lexington, KY. The Saudis "then took another flight out of the country." Because the information is so new, it was not in the 9/11 Commission's preliminary report. Subsequently, however, the commission has asked the Tampa airport "for any information about 'a chartered flight with six people, including a Saudi prince, that flew from Tampa, Florida on or about Sept. 13, 2001.'"    ACCURATE -- BUSH WAS NOT FOCUSED ON TERRORISM: In the movie, Moore charges that President Bush did not pay enough attention to pre-9/11 warnings that al Qaeda was about to attack. Instead of focusing on terrorism, charges the movie, the president spent 42 percent of his first eight months in office on vacation. That figure "came not from a conspiracy-hungry Web site but  from a calculation by The Washington Post   (http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/ 06/24/MNGSC7B3L21.DTL)   ." Read  American Progress's report   (http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c= biJRJ8OVF&b=43926)    "Truth & Consequences: The Bush Administration and 9/11" for a comprehensive history of how the White House underfunded counter-terrorism and downgraded terrorism as a priority before 9/11. See American Progress's new " Complete Saudi Primer   (http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c= biJRJ8OVF&b=99415)   " - a guide to everything you always wanted to know about the Bush-Saudi connection but were afraid to ask.    DISNEY'S EFFORT TO CENSOR MICHAEL MOORE: At the direction of CEO Michael Eisner (who is a  Bush campaign contributor   (http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.asp?NumOfThou=0&txtName=&txtState= (all+states)&txtZip=&txtEmploy=Disney&txtCand=Bush&txt2004= Y&txt2002=Y&txt2000=Y&Order=N) )  , the Walt Disney Company prohibited its Miramax division from distributing "Fahrenheit 911." The company enjoys a cozy relationship with President Bush's brother, Jeb. As governor of Florida, Jeb Bush serves as a trustee for the state employees' pension fund. That fund owns approximately 7.3 million shares of Disney stock. Eisner told reporters he was refusing to distribute the film because Disney is "such a nonpartisan company,  do not look for us to take sides   (http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-moore6may06, 1,3551619.story) ."    RIGHT-WING EFFORTS TO CENSOR MICHAEL MOORE: The campaign to silence Moore was taken up by the right-wing group with the ironic name Move America Forward. The group is headed by right-winger Howard Kaloogian, who also spearheaded the partisan campaign to  quash a miniseries about Ronald Reagan   (http://www.defendreagan.com/)    and led the partisan fight to recall California Gov. Gray Davis. Kaloogian also "credits himself with helping elect President Bush because he was No. 4 of 25 elected officials who signed a letter asking him to run in January 1999." The group, without having seen the film, "launched a preemptive attack against" the movie "by requesting movie theaters across the country not to show the film."    DAVID BOSSIE'S HYPOCRISY: The conservative front group "Citizens United," which is headed by Clinton attacker David Bossie, is trying to get the Federal Election Commission to intervene and  censor advertising for "Fahrenheit 9/11   (http://www.thehill.com/news/062404/moore.aspx)   ". Just two years ago, however, it was Bossie who led the charge against FEC interventions. On 6/12/02, The Hill newspaper reported him saying his group feels "FEC rules and regulations are abhorrent...they restrict the American people's ability to have an influence in politics."    RATED R FOR REALITY: The Motion Picture Association of America saddled the movie with an R rating. Tom Ortenberg, president of the company releasing the film, "argued that 15- and 16-year-olds, who might end up  fighting in the war   (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62638- 2004Jun22.html)    on terrorism," should be able to see the film, which shows the true cost of war - gravely wounded Iraqi citizens and U.S. troops. Much of that cost has been hidden by the Bush administration, which has banned photos of flag-draped coffins coming home (even though the  Bush campaign uses flag draped corpses   (http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/ 2004-03-11-bush-nyc-usat_x.htm)    at Ground Zero in its political commercials)  . President Bush has also  refused to attend funerals   (http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&b=12773)    of the fallen in Iraq. Moore argues that the movie needs to be seen by the widest possible audience to give the public a glimpse of the reality of war. All told, between the start of war on March 19, 2003 and June 16, 2004, 952 coalition forces were killed, including 836 U.S. military. For more on the hidden cost of war,  read this summary   (http://www.ips-dc.org/iraq/costsofwar)    by the Institute for Policy Studies."

      Ok I have been pissed off with the current actions of my bosses recently as some might have noticed. I have read the following link on RA Unions and I believe it has some valid points of discussion on how to deal with the situations.    urlLink RA Unions   I agree that making a RA Union would be going to far, and that there are other ways of exploring and working things out.   "The RA role is critical to the successful operation of university housing operations, and it should be recognized that RAs are on the front lines. The demands are unique and challenging.  It is imperative to recognize the value of this position, as well as to maintain open lines of communication about the job.  If changes need to be made to enhance the RA position, to attract quality candidates, or to better equip RAs to do their job, steps should be taken in that direction."   My demands would be:  1)  All paid positions in the residential life office during normal office hours and mail room clerks should be first offer to the Resident Advisors on first come basis. Only afterward when no other positions are left or no other Resident Advisor wants a job only then offering the job to other students should be offered.      2)  A contract with our responsibilities, and duties should be presented to the Resident Advisors once a year. For the new staff members joining mid-semester would then get a new contract also for 1 semester. There should be a duplicate copy for the administrationon and one for the Resident Advisors to obtain. Any changes that the administrationon would like to add to the contract can be added once a year before summer training begins, and must be presented in a early manner so that the staff is fully aware of the future changes.    3)  The administrationon should look into improving the RA package that is suitable and reasonable as soon as possible. This would hopefully increase the quality of potential applicants to the Resident Advisor position.  4)  The concept of series programs should be allowed again for the Resident Advisors to use as their 3 programs per month, and be counted as such per event. The amount of planning and setting up of a weekly program still takes a large amount of time. This  concept would increase the amount of programs, and residents that show up to the program. The amount of residents that show up to a constant weekly program has only shown to improve attendance over time, and to be very cost effective. The average amount of attendance has clearly decrease compared to the previous year when series programs were allowed.  5)  Protecting the needs of the Resident Advisors should be taken strongly care of and given respect. These needs may include all or the majority of the following: shelter, food, security, sleep, health, family, religion, positive reinforcement, study time, class time and respect.  6)  An equal behavior to all Resident Advisors should be highly considered at all times, except in special considerations of experience, sex, etc..

      Some people rented movies: Along Came Polly and Pirates of the Caribbean. Along Came Polly was alright I guess nothing special, I don't know if it is even worth renting. Pirates of the Caribbean I saw probably for the 5th or 6th time, still good just hate watching movie I seen already over & over again within the same year.   I bought 3 movies from Hollywood video (3 for $25): Master & Commander, Last Samurai, and School of Rock. I was happy just to find three movies I liked. :)  I'm still working on my thesis paper, re-reading about Monte Carlo Methods making sure my thesis is correct, I might be adding a little in that section of my paper though. The Temporal Difference section was shorter and easier to read then I thought. That is the next section I have to thoroughly write on. After that I will probably write a MC version and a TD version of a Tic-Tack-Toe game. It would have been easier to write up a blackjack game to show these methods off instead, but o well.  I hopefully am done before Aug. 8 or I will have to pay for an additional 1 credit again. I am starting to worry about money, because I know moving to California is not going to be cheap, and I will need to get a new vehicle once I'm out there. I will also need to get a map of L.A. and Long Beach since I will probably get lost. Got way to much to think about right now.   1) Thesis 2) Presentation Material 3) Clothes for the presentation? 4) Packing 5) Travel 6) Money 7) Sell Car 8) Buy New Car 9) etc..............(And a lot more) :(

      The first thing you learn about being an RA is the lack of respect you get from the students, other offices on campus and your bosses.  They teach the RAs in training that you are now part of the college staff, and that you will have to follow and enforce the college’s rules and regulations even if you might disagree with them. The RAs on this campus are basically treated as the lowest class of citizens; we are given all the mundane work that no one else wants to do.   We have to work at all hours of the days, especially when we are on duty. This of course is obviously in the job description. We end up with 3am calls for lockouts, and stupid questions like “can we borrow the pool balls”, then at 9am in the morning we get calls from the other offices looking for our bosses. The thing is our boss is usually late to work, while we are not supposed to be late. She lives right above her office so its not like it’s a traffic issue or something to get to work. There is sometimes the excuse that she “forgot to un-forward the phones”, so basically she is blind in the morning and has trouble doing something that should become a repetition. Now getting back to the all hours of the day wakeup calls from students. We were basically, been told not to call our own bosses at these early morning situations unless it’s a death or rape situation. The excuse they gave us, this is the funny part, “We work all the time 24hrs a day for 5 days a week (huh?!?!?!? - what a lie) and we need our break from res-life”. The truths about their hours are maybe 9am – 4pm for the weekdays where they are in the office for maybe 4hrs of that max. . They use the excuse that they are in meetings all day.       --RA Schedules--  The RA schedule is always full, this past semester I hardly ever talked to my roommates, because I was always busy and only taking two classes. I would get up every weekday at 10am and not be back home until 12 Midnight. The reasons are classes, lunch, dinner, meetings, 1-2 hours of study time/ homework time, 1hr of work, and RA programs. This is not including RA duty, which can happen 1-2 times a week. Now I’m not whining here, I can accept a full schedule, but our bosses don’t respect that we got other things to do. The give us extra work to do, which is also part of the job and I’m not here to complain about this either, where we got to go around to our residents and get signatures stating that they moved in, signatures on their room damage sheets, signatures on their fire/health safety report, and signatures if they might want to stay over any breaks that might be coming up.   --Programming--  Here is the problem, they think us RAs have all the time in the world, and that we only spend 15minutes setting up programs and running them. It actually takes about 15 minutes just to think of an idea and fill out the necessary paper work to request money, then about 1 hour to buy the materials or setup reservation, 1-2 hours to make advertisements and post them in every building, another 20 minutes to setup for these programs, about 3 hours to run the program, another 30 minutes of clean up and then finally 5 minutes to do a program evaluation. That’s about 7 hours out of our time to do a program, where we have to do this 3 times a month for 3 months. Now we do get our room paid and 50 dollars for each semester to spend only on food. That’s about $2350 dollars we get back in our pocket. We have been requesting for a better RA package for years (obvious reason for the decline in RA applicants).  Other schools give their RAs a stipend position about $2000, free room and free meals. The excuse they give us is either one of the following:  “We can’t afford to give a better package” – I can understand this one.  “It’s all because of 911, we are in a budget crisis” – They used this one for 3 years straight.  “The budget hasn’t been past in the state congress yet this year, we are in a budge crisis” – This happens every year and we are probably given about the same amount of money every year.  “Enrollment is down this year, we are in a budget crisis” – They say this at the end of every year, HELLO we haven’t had an orientation yet, how do we know this stuff before hand?  --Decisions Decisions--  Now we are not police, but we have to enforce the school’s policy with almost no authority. So a lot of the time we have to go on our best judgment of what is breaking a rule, it’s a small fine line. The most common incident on this campus is loud music. When do us RAs decide that something is to loud? Well it depends on each RA tolerance of the music and how loud it is. If someone played loud country music out their window, I would probably be over there in 5 seconds, but playing Alt. Rock I might wait 2 hours to say something. Now if we do end up writing someone up for the loud music you would hope that your bosses would back us up and support our decision. This is obviously not the case, if anything we get reprimanded for doing our job. So when this incident happens again or something totally different the students give us little or no attention to what we say since they know they will not get in trouble or they might be sent a piece of paper stating what they did was wrong (a slap on the hand).   --Unwritten Rules No One Tells Us About--  Even if we don’t break the rules some RAs still get in trouble. On this campus the ability to play beer-pong at one time was legal. One day during fire inspections of one of the RAs suite, they find a table that is used for beer pong. The RA who lives in this suite got fired even though the table was not his and it was perfectly legal according to the student handbook. Fast-forward to the next year when a new student handbook came about and they finally add one line to the alcohol policy stating that drinking games are not allowed to be played. Now us RAs were forced to go around and enforce this new rule with hatred coming from every student, and the reason that given was: “We believe that drinking games peer-pressure people into drinking”. Well Duh, but it still doesn’t mean they still have to drink, and most drinking games I have played don’t even get me drunk.   --RA of the Year--  Once a year there is an event called “Spring Formal”, where rewards are also given out. One of these rewards is the RA of the Year. Us RAs assume that these awards are given out to RAs that have done their job and beyond, at least that is what is told to us. Well we are all wrong and stupid in believing that, it’s a popularity contest with the bosses. It goes to the one whom tattles on their fellow RAs, or is close buddy with the bosses. One RA who has been here since the dinosaurs, just kidding KJ, has never once won this prestige reward, many students know him, talk to him and believe he is the best RA here at SUNYIT. This person has won every other possible RA award and the made up ones, but has never been allowed to win the ass kisser of the year award, I mean the RA of the year award.   --Being Watched All The Time--  The other offices on this campus love to spread rumors about us RAs being slackers, not doing our jobs, etc. They like to think that we have it easy in res-life and treat us like the black sheep of the family. We are highly underpaid, overworked, tired students who have to walk around and do everything with perfections in our grades, actions, and programs. We are constantly ridiculed that there are no programs on campus, which is obviously not true. We can’t make mistakes dealing with money, must react quickly and appropriate to non-important and important situations, all while we are suppose to show that we are a model student.   So I here writing this long report on how poorly we are treated in the past, which is nothing compared to how we been treated the summer so far (4 weeks into the summer). I have been working for res-life now for 4 years, and been doing the mail service a majority of that time. This job was once a 2-hour per day job for 5 days with a decent pay probably around 6.50/hour. During the past semesters this job was dropped to 1 hour per day for 5 days with my pay probably around 5.15/hour. While they have been decreasing my time and pay, they have also increase my job criteria. I had to go around and deliver phone books to every suite (about 100), go through every newspaper (about 100 daily) and tear off the names in the corner, and post a flyer on every suite door stating how the newspapers are dealt with (even though I put several up in the mailroom the week before). I still have to maintain the mailroom, deliver mail to every box, forward mail, update the forwarding list every semester, and other boring mail clerk duties.   --A Surprise Twist--  I have been an RA over the past 4 summers now, and I know what a summer RA has to do. (duty, programs, orientations, etc.) This summer they didn’t even tell me that they weren’t going to hire me to do the mail. I had to find out on my last paycheck that they weren’t going to pay me anymore. The excuse given to me by the secretary: “We don’t have the budget to hire Temp Service over the summer” (another budget crisis?, HA).    Instead I am supposed to do it for free, because now every RA over the summer has to do 8 hrs of work in the office. This leaves us with no time to have a job since we got to work in the office during the day, evening and night. I don’t know any job that that is flexible for us RAs to be able to get paid elsewhere. Essentially I and other RAs have no or little income for food, while working for free.   --Here it comes the punch below the belt--  Then it is rumor that they hired a temp service worker full time up in Mohawk, (odds are this rumor is true heard from multiple sources) and she is living up there with air conditioning suite all by herself. They are trying to keep it a secret, but being an RA we catch on quickly.   It not like I don’t mind doing the job, but they treat us like they are doing us a favor of giving us all this extra, unnecessary work meanwhile without a thank-you, monetary pay, or special treats (like lunch). Then they go behind our backs and treat other people with more respect by giving them a job versus their own RAs whom have more experiences of doing mail and handling special conferences.

           Being an RA at this school for 3 years plus has shown me how money is squander so easily at this school. One of the first things you notice is that all the money goes to only two departments, Admissions and Athletics.   Admissions some how gets the money first because their reason is "We recruit the students". They end up with brand new furniture that is leather, nice desk lamps, new carpeting, new computers (almost every year), have 3 full time administrators plus advisors for freshmen, and international students, and two full time secretaries. Now here is the problem,   1.	Enrollment at this college is getting worst every year. An example of this was this previous orientation. Only 25 students, and this year's setup was the worst ever.  2.	Admission only recruits people, after that they want nothing to do with the students.       The admission department on this campus is given to much power. My previous boss was fired because she got on the bad side of admissions on day. She stated that they wanted us RA's to do a job that has nothing to do with our job, I forgot what the job was but it was some ridiculous request. Once her contract was up the school just happens not to reinstate it, basically telling her she is fired.         Athletics is another weird department on this campus that is given way to much power. At one time the game room was a nice location, then athletics comes in takes over the room and moves the game room to a crappy, sweat sock smelling room like dungeon with no ventilation or windows. All the equipment in the game room has deteriorated to almost no use. Meanwhile athletics was given money to put new equipment in the old game room.       Some how the athletics dept. has convince the administration at this school that they are some how important, and that they "recruit students". The thing is our sports here are terrible we have a losing record in every sport except basketball. The school is small and no one shows up to any of the games, taking aside basketball. I have no clue how someone falls for that line.        In the past few years the school has decided to become a four-year school instead of an upper graduate only school. That is a good move, however the path that has been chosen is totally idiotic. We need to expand this school's on campus housing, get more academic buildings and a larger dining hall. There is no way the school will be able to survive on only admitting less then one hundred freshmen a year, especially since they need to stay on campus for the first year or two.        Now guess what the first building to be built is? You might have guessed it, a new athletic complex, with an indoor soccer field and hockey rink. Hockey??? We don't even have a hockey team yet. So while SUNY tries to spend a multi-million dollar project on athletics, we are stuck here with no development in the important areas.       Then there is the process of hiring. When the school was hiring a new hall director, a new director, and a new coach, guess who was given more attention. The coach had 8 people interview him from different depts. on this campus, while the hall director had only 3 people, and the director had none.

      Well I just heard from Karthik today via email. He and his wife, Savitha, have moved to Parramatta,Australia (near Sydney). He has gotten a new job as a network analyst for a American insurance company called RGA (Reinsurance Group of America). He says that his manager is in Canada permanently, so he will be managing everything there for all the offices in Syndney, Malaysia, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and HongKong. He says he does a lot of traveling to these countries, and should be coming back here to the U.S. soon for some traveling also.

      Ok, SUNYIT is not a very well known school especially in the southern part of New York where I went to school. The only reason I went to this school is because of the price of tuition was cheap and there was on campus housing. I have always commuted to school and have never had the on-campus experience. These are the main two reasons I decided SUNYIT as my school to transfer to.   The campus was actually social at one time; it's hard to believe that by looking at it now (will discuss this in the later and in the other series). Drinking was allowed outside where the alcohol just had to be in a plastic cup. There were I say on average about 15 students outside everyday in each quad. The parties on this campus happen every weekend starting on Thursday. Now for some this might be weird, but here at SUNYIT at one point classes were only Monday through Thursday. So Thursday was a large party day after classes got out everybody will start drinking and hanging out then at 10pm head down to the bowling alley (SUNYIT student are allowed to bowl for free on Thurs. Nights) and get more drunk.   There was also a place at one time on this campus where people could have hanged out. It was called the "Game Room"; the place was kept up to shape. It had 2 free billiard tables with pool sticks, chalk, and a bridge. These tables were in nice shape. There were also a foos ball table, and a ping-pong table. The place had seating and a surround sound stereo system. On average there would be about 10-20 students in this room (I'm guessing on the dimension here) 20 feet x 50 feet, with a window to lookout into the campus center.   In the beginning of school, I remember the tour up to Mohawk (the nicer residence hall) how they had air conditioning, cupboards, nice looking furniture, microwave/fridge combo, new carpet, clean white walls, nicely cut grass, etc. The place looked real nice and beautiful.   I started my work-study at residence life office. It was an interesting, and I learn a lot about what many students don't know they can get, if only they ask.  I didn't join any clubs or extracurricular activities for the first two semesters, since I have had a bad experience of going to another college (that is over priced) and just had to much on my plate to get my grades up and live a normal life. I decided to take it easy for the first year.   After a few months of easy grades, I met some nice friends in the game room that also liked to play a lot and have fun every weekend bowling, drinking and going to clubs. Here a short bio on them from 3 years ago:   Karthik Rajaraman - An Indian (the country) graduate student in telecommunication.  Steve Burgess - A big tall white bald guy who loved to drink and meet girls.  Alex Calbaras (probably misspelled) - A long hair black guy who loved to meet girls.  Eli DeJesus - A short Hispanic who loved to meet girls.   While I been a student for the first year I have never meet any of my RAs, problems were non-existent I think they wanted a social atmosphere here on the campus.   At the end of the school year I have applied to become a Resident Advisor (R.A.), and was accepted. I also asked to stay on for the summer to help out. At this point my GPA was about 3.77 and my bosses who were in Res-Life were changing to different position at SUNYIT.   Jeff Schneider - Hall Director -> Athletics & Alumni  John Borner - Director of Res. Life -> Director of Campus Life  Cathie Hills(part-time grad position) - Asst. Hall Director  It was time for Res. Life to hire replacements.   Bonnie Borrowman Key - Hall Director of Res-Life.  Cathie Hills - (only one who stayed on for transition) Asst Hall director for Adirondack Hall  Mandy Miller - (also a part time grad position) Asst Hall Director for Mohawk Hall   The Asst. Hall Director is given special rooms on campus with air-conditioning, stove, refrigerator, etc.   This ends part I, stay tune for part II

      Well my friend from Elmira, NY came up this weekend to hand in some papers into the school. We rented Paycheck and Eurotrip, these were good movies even though I know the critics didn't like Paycheck. Eurotrip is just like the movie road trip, just as funny to watch, and more nudity (good and bad). Paycheck was a good thriller that lasted throughout the whole movie.  We also went to watch Harry Potter 3. I like the Harry Potter movies since it's a nice escape from reality.   I have also been asked to do reviews for Xbox games for  urlLink 4gbg , so that should be a little hobby. It's a website that a bunch of us old gamers & ex-STGC members are putting together.

      I think the supply of hybrid cars should increase. When a vehicle can get 55mpg, everyone should probably think about one. Especially with gas prices around $2.15/gal and higher.  urlLink Hybrid Cars. Great starting point for hybrid research.   A great show on PBS called Scientific American Frontiers with Alan Alda (the funny guy from M.A.S.H) showed a good show of different types of cars from hybrid cars to hydrogen cars.   urlLink Scientific American Frontiers show on Future Car   Hydrogen, IMO, is the future but the near future is probably the hybrid cars.   Also, I heard that the gas prices are suppose to reach $3.00/gal sometime over the summer hike.

So as another option I been watching some of the great shows on Rantv.com over winamp. They talk about wireless stuff on seatle wireless and Kevin Rose from TechTv has a show called The Broken which was awsome. The first show is downloadable http://www.thebroken.org/ They sit on a couch and drink beer and talk about hacking and stealing pizza. It reminds me of the first few years TechTv when it was more of a underground type show and they could get away with a lot of things before getting to commericalize.

      Almost done with the thesis, I have to change the names in the thesis to reflect the committee of professors (Roger Cavallo, Rosemary Mullick, and Jorge Novillo), and delete an empty page, then I will pay .50 cents to bind them. so if everything is alright tomorrow I'll probably make 5 bounded copies ($2.50) 1 for each professor and 2 for myself. I'm just hoping they like it. Roger asked me if he was going to enjoy the thesis. What am I suppose to say, I wrote it but not satisfied-- am I ever going to be satisfied with it? He also&nbsp;said it was a coincident that his son ,whom I think is going for his PHD, was also reading a Barto book (Sutton and Barto&nbsp;write a lot on reinforcement learning). and asked if he is mention&nbsp;in my thesis.

Worry:- Have to get my paper up to code by this FRIDAY ahhhhhhhhhhh. Nervous:- I have to ask for two other professors to sit in on my presentation and then also present. Don't know who I'm going to ask for. I might try Cavallo, but his questions can be difficult, and I might try Rosemary even though I don't know her that well (only had her once in my undergraduate class first semester) but I think she got her PHD dissertation in A.I. so that could be interesting. If I want it easy I probably pick some undergrad teachers and such. Oh well been here to long back to the typing and coding. Hope everything works out.......

       urlLink Over/Spun  Another great political site, mostly funny. My favorite stuff is the O'Reilly's Lies, Rushy Maguire is a little humourous. There is a lot of political humor here. Its the only way I like to listen to politics most of the time, because I usually get fed up watching normal news and how the conservatives in the US are taking over and calling people who are not on their side: tree hugging hippies, who are not patriotic and unamerican and how they should leave america and support terrorism in France. I agree with Michael Moore, where he basically said he (and I) want to stay in America and make it great again. The gap between the rich and poor is a large divide and keeps growing which just leads to anger and jeolousness from the poor. Growing up with little money, I feel this anger. One reason I like John Edwards, he started off poor and changed that. I believe this is what most americans want and Im not trying to take that away, but there are a few, all conservative republicans, who want to make laws that make it tough for us poor people to confortably. Its ridicolous how much it cost to live, even in a cheap low living standard like New York. Where paying for electricity, and gas to heat the homes are costing upto $300 a month. Thats a lot of money to use poor people, then we have to worry about increase gas prices, cheap food that isn't of any quality, etc... I hope I never become a republican. Ill end this rabbiling from one of my favorite quotes from Winston Churchill that went something like:  You have no heart if you are not a liberal when you are young, and you have no brain if you are not a conservative when you are old.

      Worked on my program of the Monte Carlo Tic-Tac-Toe, been having problems and fixing them. Right now my problem is that the program is not exploring enough. It reaches only 1000+ states and stops exploring. I would like it to reach 4000 - 6000 states when it is learning. I figure I'll work on this some more and start making the TD(0) next then Dynamic Programming last. I figure the DP will probably end up to be the best, even though the other two methods are an improvement on DP.  &nbsp; I have to go visit my advisor this Monday, and &nbsp;get my car.&nbsp;I will try to finish a section on TD-lambda hopefully this Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; Got about 3 weeks to get my shit together and still have to worry about  urlLink www.4gbg.com  also.  &nbsp; I will also need to get my paper proof read and fixed to the CS standard for publication after all that.

      Yesterday I had to work up in Mohawk from 4pm to 12am for free of course without any compusation. Thats 31 hours in the office and 54 hours out of the office on-call this week. (*Drum Roll*)Making a total of 85 hours this week!!!! FUCK ME.   Getting back to my day:  I planned ahead and went to get a movie: The Butterfly Effect (a good movie, love the extras about chaotic dynamical systems, hehe math) and a Xbox game: Hitman Contracts. So you would expect everything to be on the good, but on the way back my car's battery light came on and I have no clue why.   Today I went to get in my car and it wouldn't work, but gave it a second try and it worked. I went to drop of the game and movie just incase there was something wrong with the car figuring it should at least run until I turn it off again. So I go to blockbuster without having take a shower, wearing the same clothes from yesterday and my hair is all messed up. So on the way back from blockbuster my car finally died again (3rd time this summer). I called the tow truck and they wont look at the car until Monday, and I had to walk home.   I decided to walk since I was only 1 hr walk away from home, but 1 hr of walking sucks when wearing loose jeans that fall down, unwash hair and the warm sun beaming down. Hey Im a Comp Sci major, if I see the sun more then once a year it was to much. To include in the walk I had my backpack full with my xbox and stuff adding weight on my tired shoulder.   I get home and rest for an hour and a half before I go back into the office again. I'm here in the office trying to waste time, I wrote a review of the Hitman:Contracts for the  urlLink 4GBG.com  website.

      The furniture at this school is one of the most uncomfortable I have seen. Why would any school select uncomfortable furniture, is my question?   A comfortable furniture just makes more sense, I guess that would be the main reason for this furniture. This school's choices always comes down to cheap, stupidity.   My argument: The more comfortable a chair, bed or couch is the better the students will be in all aspects of their life.   A comfortable desk chair would help, allowing students to study, and write more while on the computer. I and most students can last about 3 hours max sitting in these backbreaking chairs. So I'm assuming that this school wants the students not to do well in their school work.   A comfortable living room chair and couch would help out in social settings. By having a more welcoming living room, we would allow students to be social for longer hours, and potentially give guest and sleep over guest a more positive view on the school. The couch is impossible to sleep on where there are 2 boards, one that hits the ribs, the other on the hips. The chairs are not comfortable either, the board in the back hits about under the shoulder blades, making most students have back problems after a couple of hours. It is hard to sit still for a movie when the chair is becoming very uncomfortable. So I'm assuming that this school wants the students to have no social life within their own suite, making the students crave for their bed.  The bed is comfortable enough to sleep in, but that's it. The beds here squeak every time you move, and are very small. The students here are afraid of falling off their bed. It is a XL single bed, about 7 feet by 2.5 feet. To roll over in the bed is impossible, the students have to basically rotate in one location hovering above the bed then laying back down. I'm guessing this school doesn't want the students to get enough sleep. This of course has a large impact on our school work, social life, and health.  I figure, hoping, that the school doesn't want this, but instead got the cheapest piece of crap furniture they can find. Sure it might look nice to potential students, but the real students know better.   You can go to the school's website at  urlLink SUNYIT  and can look all you want and never find a picture of the student's rooms might look like.

       urlLink   See the red chevy corsica in the image. I be happy to get rid of it for a few hundred dollars. The car needs new front breaks, oil change, and for some reason likes to stall. That is why I'm selling it so cheap. If interested contact me via email or phone. andrusw@sunyit.edu (315)351-3261

      So I finally meet my advisor again, and now we are finalizing the thesis by going over and making sure that it is a clear, coherent understanding to the reader. We spent 2 hours going over 10 pages. So I have to come in tommorow to continue with the other 49+ pages. Should be interesting...

      I sent out a majority of my packages today except stuff I figure I can carry on to the airplane. It cost me $290 to send out 21 packages. I'm poor..... I'm hoping to sell my car before Aug 16th, but doubtful. I have to pay for the car insurance still and don't have enough money yet. I'll need to get home some time this thursday or friday and find some luggage and hopefully get some money from my grandma from my birthday back in late April. I know I know I'm evil because I don't talk to my own family and stuff. I figure if I sell my car cheaply for about $350 I can get money back in my pocket. Why so cheaply, well it needs some repair like front breaks and it now likes to stall for some reason.

      Well I got my day started off by picking up my $300 suit and buying some cheap payless dress shoes for $40. I had my presentation today had some people say good luck because of the email stating the day of my defense:   William Andrus will be presenting his MS Thesis titled “Reinforcement Learning in Games” this Wednesday August 4, 2004 at 1:30 p.m. in Room C212.  Everyone is welcome to attend.   Jorge Novillo Professor CS Department SUNY Institute of Technology Utica, NY 13504-3050 (315) 792-7352 (o) / (315) 738-1896 (h) jorge@sunyit.edu  jorge.sunyit.edu    From Kevin Mills:   Hey Will good luck with ur thesis tomorrow,  Kevin    From Mike Usselman:   I would be there if I could but can't work and all  let me know when you are coming home  later,  Mike    From Tracy Boyarsky-Smith:   Just a note of congratulations to Will Andrus who defended his thesis successfully today!!!  All our best to you Will--you're graduating!  This is actually a serious campaign for Will, rather than "get you back" prank!  ;)   Tracy Boyarsky-Smith, Hall Director SUNYIT P.O. Box 3050 Utica, NY 13504 (315) 792-7422   So I dressed up:        And had the following professors show up: Jorge Novillo (MY THESIS ADVISOR)      Sam Sengupta      Rosemary Mullick      Roger Cavallo      Salahuddin Qazi:      Atlas Hsie      After a few dozen tough questions and 1 hour of presenation time.

After that  I came back to my room i had to change to get ready for the orienation that is today. All this on little sleep.

      Ok, I went to the "Men's Wearhouse" to buy a suit, service isn't bad. They try and make you look good, but also try to make you buy a lot of useless stuff. I spent about $500 on a full suit, shirt, tie, spenders.   So I was watching C-Span today and saw Christina Hoff Sommers discuss how terrible V-day is and how men are actually unrepresented and bashed through these events and other similar areas. I'm obvious a left-wing liberal democrat, but I agree with this fully. Some of information about her and what she has been saying can be found at these sites.  urlLink AEI   urlLink The Atlantic   urlLink Dartreview Newspaper  She made some very good points on how these events are male bashing, and crying for equal rights they have already received. They say that this is a male society and the names of the female anantomy have been taken over by males and that they must "retake" them back. Huh?????  I believe if we have a V-day just for the very minority of the students on this campus of females about all 10 of them. Then there should be a fair amount of time and money to be used on the opposition to V-day. This is a very controversial topic, and should only be fairly debated equally. If it is possible I would like to see Dr. Sommers come to this school and give a lecture.   This brings me to some other things: Men are usually protrude as stupid idiots in t.v. commercials who fall apart and are accident prone, while women are the smart, logical(that is obviously false) one who seem to show no irrational emotions and save the day.   Examples:  Hemi Truck Commerical: Wife talking logic of why the vechicle is bought, then husband only thinks one work "power" and then burns his oven mitt.  The typical house cleaning commericals: Husband and Wife makes a bet which product is better. Husband loses terribly with stain still there after some tire work and elbow grease, while the women hardly does anything but squirts a little of this magical liquid and ta-da its cleaned.   ??? Internet Doctor or health Comerical: Women sits at computer looks outside at husband and sees that he is about to do something stupid either cut himself, get bee stings, etc.. She sits there takes five seconds to get the information (very doubtfull it take that quick) and she is the one to save the day, again and again, and again.   Tampoon Comerical: Teacher catches two girls passing a tampoon in class and this 40 year male teacher has no clue what a tampoon looks like? And ask if they have enough to share with the class.

      Well I have my thesis defense, hopefully tomorrow. I have been trying to contact my advisor for the past two days and haven't found him. (Maybe he is hiding from me?) I have to see if he like the updates and stuff, and I have to still bind the thesis. I shaved today which sucks because I look like I'm barely 21 of age. I'm should be getting my hair cut today and maybe a suit sometime around 1pm. Nixon is driving me, since my car is not working and the battery charger won't be back until August 10th. I have been packing stuff, and need more boxes &amp; tape to complete this task. I might be shipping some stuff out today. I just hoping I get this thesis stuff out of the way and graduate, else I will probably have to pay $400+ for one stupid credit of continuation on my thesis. What Bullshit!! I might be having some other problems, but I'm too busy to care right now about that. I need to  kill someone  punch something to get this fustration out.

Computer Monitor  Computer Tower  CD, DVD, Games Discs  Xbox  Gamecube  Cameras & Stand (might carry it on the plane?)  Flashlight  Batteries &amp; Charger (might carry it on the plane?)  Golfclubs ?? (might just buy new ones anyway)  Football, Rollerblades, Volleyball (might leave behind and just buy new ones)  Boardgames: Monolopy, Clue, Risk, Boulderdash, Malarky, Life, Jenga, Poker Chips, ...  Sports Net  Alarm Clock  Pens, Pencil, Papers,   Calculator  Computer Tools  Wireframe for Discs
