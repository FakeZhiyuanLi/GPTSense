      I'm sitting here eating a spinach chicken salad from Wendy's.  It is good.  The little grape tomatoes are sweet and not mushy.  The greens are fresh and crisy.  Then there's the hard boiled egg crumbled on top.  Yum.  This is our second weekend in a row of eating pretty much nothing but fast food and chips.  But that's the way it goes when we are in the midst of a project.  Luckily the fast food places are now offering more healthy choices, such as this salad I am enjoying.  The Big Macs we had for dinner last night were damned tasty though!  I actually love to cook.  It is very pleasing to me to put together a nice meal for my family.  Then the pleasure is multiplied when they enjoy it.  But to cook, one has to have time to go to the grocery store.  I may get there by the middle of June.  If we run out of fudgesicles before then, however, I'll somehow find the time.  After all a home without fudgesicles is ... well ... a dark and less pleasurable place.

      Okay so I blew off work today.  Well I didn't really blow it off.  I politely cancelled and rescheduled for another day.  Then I spent the day moving between bed and the computer and back again.  Until I hit the bed around 2:30pm and crashed hard.  Crashed hard and woke up groggy wondering if I should even bother getting up.  But I did.  Just when I thought it was safe to go back.  Silly mental headtrips.  I'm stronger than that, aren't I?

      We've been hearing about these amazing Generation Xeroid cicadas for months now.  Every morning I'd peek out the windows expecting to see swarms of the sleepy bugsters flying willy-nilly around the yard banging into the house and hanging off the trees.  I kept a close watch for their husks, expecting them to pile up and crunch underfoot of the non-wary walker.  I re-told the story  ad nauseum  of The Boy playing army with their shells the last time the cicadas emerged way back when.  I was prepared to protect the puppers from gorging themselves on those delectable insects which, I have read, are popular doggie snacks.  Too many cicadas are bad for the tummy evidently---something I hope to never personally experience.  So anyway.  The hype built up as cicadas began emerging around the DC area.  We did finally see a husk in the yard, then another, then an actual full grown cicada briefly buzzed by.  But that had been all.  What a letdown, I thought.  Then came a visit to a client on Eisenhower Avenue.  As I stepped out of my car the air literally vibrated with the sounds of cicadas, their song ebbing and flowing in complete larger than life surround sound.  And I noticed the trees.  There was no breeze, but the leaves were alive with movement.  Cicadas would fly in and out, around and about, no clear destination apparent.  I began to count my blessings our own neighborhood was not so infested.  I walked down the middle of the parking lot, keeping as far from the trees as possible.  My terror (yes I'll call it terror because I fear bugs in a BIG way for no reason other I than can't control where they'll go or what they'll do when they get there) I kept at bay by strength of will alone.  I'd heard the stories of those huge mindless cicadas crashing into people or getting tangled in their hair (like I have enough for them to get tangled in!) and other horrors of encounters with alienish insects.  I made it to the office door and noticed the lifeless carcass of a once full-of-life cicada on the sidewalk.  They really are ugly little suckers and what a bizarre lifecycle.  The decision was made not to think about having to traverse the same route to get back to my car just yet.  Wonder if I'll still be around here when the next batch of 17-year cicadas emerges?

      It's 6:30 am.  Well close enough.  My eyes are still a bit blurry despite the shower.  I am fully dressed to the shoes.  Fucking flylady has that phrase stuck in my head.  No, I'm not a follower of the flylady although she does have some concepts that are useful to keep in mind when going about one's daily life.  I'm awake because I'm waiting for the electrician who is evidently a morning person.  Blech.  Blech blech blech to the morning people of the world!  Hooray to the electrician though.  He'll be rewiring the bathroom and installing a ventilation fan.  Phase II of the bathroom update, but that's a subject for a different blog.  I haven't whined once about having to shower downstairs.  Yet.  I have, however, had battles in my head about using the toilet down there.  I saw a spider in that toilet and can't seem to get that out of my head.  It would be useful to have a flush for one's thoughts similar to the flush of a toilet.  Happy day?  You bet.

      Mine life hath passeth before mine eyes.  Today I boldly traversed the newest addition to a section of freeway referred to as the Springfield Mixing Bowl.  It is a mile long feels like 15 miles high scare-the-crap-out-of-me highway flyover from the inner loop to 95 southbound.  Now I don't much like heights and I truly don't like bridges.  This is a terrifying combination of the two.  Gotta admit, my heart rate was already soaring when the goddamn check engine light in my car lit up to add to my discomfort.  Good news is I survived but I was all the way to Woodbridge before my palms stopped sweating.  Better news is it makes that merge on to 95 south a breeze.  Bad news is my check engine light is still on.  Ack well, at least I didn't fly off the edge into oblivion and crash onto the freeway 15 miles below.  It's a good day indeed.

      I read something yesterday that referred to members of a sorority as "sorostitutes".  Clever.  I love word play.

      Undeniably THE best strips of delicious, tender, juicy, flavorful chicken with THE best light crunchy batter of all!  I really really really like the spicy variety with the firey good hotness offset by the sweet and sour dipping sauce.  Well, the official name of the sauce I like is "confetti", but the subtitle reads sweet and sour.  Saying confetti sauce just does not convey much of anything.  I mean, who has tasted confetti and been left with a favorable impression of the taste?  My girlfriend prefers the cajun honey mustard dipping sauce.  Yes that's right!  Mustard!  Only those that know her well realize how far she's come in the mustard loving department.  Bit by bit I'm luring her over to the dark side.  Muhahahaha!  Now if I could just get Popeye's strips and KFC coleslaw at the same restaurant.  I might just die in a fit of sensorial fast food chicken and side dish delight.

      Out here in the suburbs there are other lesbians, but Wendy and I don't know many.  There is one couple we socialize with on occasion.  I'll come back to them another time because they are interesting.  And they have a friend we have run into several times in unexpected places.  Our veterinarians are two more.  Well one of them for sure, and the other one is missing a grand opportunity if she has not yet realized it.  She probably has.  No confirmation because it's not often that the subject of sexuality comes up during a vet visit.  Gaydar is useful.  And we've met another odd trio of lesbians through Wendy's workplace.  They are involved a quite bizarre love triangle.  Two of them are... well there is just no polite way to say this... scary-bulging-sloppy-sweaty-legs-as-big-around-as-my-waist-and-watermelon-boobies size persons.  Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against overweight folks.  It's just these two are SO enormous that it's noteworthy.  They have great personalities and each is interesting in her own right.  But the quite bizarre love triangle thing gives me the oogies in a big way.  The third banana of that bunch is a regular sized woman: t-shirt, blue jeans, baseball hat wearing short haired stereotypical dyke-type.  I don't know if she shaves her legs, but she might.  She's the one that bounces back and forth between the fatties and plays games with all of their heads and hearts and other body parts that I refuse to even think about.  Oogie factor and all.  Big way.  The woman at the Mobil station, the one who calls everyone 'Hun', is a possibility.  But it's probably just because she reminds me of a friend of an ex of mine.  They could be twin sisters separated at birth.  Or it could be because that friend of an ex of mine also used to work at a Mobil station, albeit a completely different Mobil station in a completely different part of town.  So Wendy and I hang around with our hetero friends of various ages, sizes and personal quirkitudes.  Suburban neighborhoods are rife with heteros in need of token lesbian friends.  We are glad to be of service.

      Cosine is the first dog who has completely and wholly belonged to me.  Mutt, my family dog growing up, didn't count as "my" dog because she was really my mom's dog.  Just like my son can never really call Cosine "his" dog, because she's really mine.  She's a bitch.  She barks too much because she's stone deaf and doesn't realize she's making such hellacious noise.  Recently she's decided she doesn't like to jump up onto the bed, where she really wants to be, so she whines and barks until I get up and lift her up to join us.  Yeah.  I'm whipped.  So what?  She's very sweet and dear, and I love her with all my heart.  I must, otherwise I'd never put up with her barking.  And while she is, like the rest of us, moving closer and closer with each passing day toward the end of her life and her grave, she's not the one to whom I refer when I say my dog is dying.  It's her brother Detail who is actively going about the business of dying.  Cosine has been part of our family since she was about nine weeks old. She and Detail are from the same litter, but Detail initially lived with some other family.  Some stupid non-dog-loving family (SNDLF) adopted Detail, even though four out of the six family members didn't like dogs.  They hired a professional dog trainer, took him to the vet as needed, groomed him regularly.  But did they love him like he needed to be loved?  I think not because after about a year, the SNDLF decided they didn't want him any more.  WTF??  So he came to live with us.  Despite his "professional" training, he did have many bad-dog habits.  Like running willy-nilly out any exterior door that happened to open.  It took but a few hours of instruction to help him realize doing that was just a really bad idea.  But I can't fault him for wanting to do it.  The SNDLF didn't have a fenced yard.  With the exception of those occasional front door I-need-to-run-and-play-and-explore escapes, Detail had NEVER been outside except on a leash.  And he just was not that fond of being on the leash.  Imagine.  Fortunately for him and because we are smart dog loving people, we had a fenced yard.  A big yard.  Crappy fence, but good enough.  Lots of room to run around.  Plenty of native wildlife to chase.  Trees to pee on.  Suburban passers-by at whom to bark.  Warm sunshine in which to nap.  Sticks to fetch and chew.  You know, all the good stuff dogs deserve.  Our kitchen door led to a small deck with stairs going down to the backyard.  Since we had been working on the "just because the door is open doesn't mean you should run out" training, when I opened that door he sat politely yet quivering anticipatorily near the door watching me.  I will never forget the look of disbelief transforming into unadulterated joy as I waved an invitation for him to proceed out the door unrestrained by a leash.  He bounded past me, down the stairs and into the yard where he did free doggie things to his heart's content.  Detail quickly developed a routine.  Rain, snow, sleet, or sunshine.  Out the door, down the stairs, down through the right side of the wooded area to the back fence, looping around to race up the left side of the wooded area to the front fence, surveying his domain.  Soon his path was worn and visible and rarely did he deviate.  He'd sit outside for hours on the deck, watching over his home and soaking up the sun.  Rarely did he bark to come in, leaving that job to his sister who was, even at that young age, a champion barkaholic.  He only raised his voice when there was really something to raise it about, like a child riding his bike down the street.  "Alarm alarm! They are coming to kill us all!",  he'd proclaim lustily and loudly in his rich deep baritone voice.  When they were younger, I, along with my son who was also younger, would take them hiking in the woods of a nearby park.  I'd let them off their leashes and they would take off running through the forest, circling back every so often to make sure we were still on the right path.  The paths led near a reservoir and the dogs would swim.  Detail and Cosine both loved to swim.  They would chase sticks out into the water, and bring them merrily back to shore to do it all over again.  Detail, as seemed his nature, would sometimes ignore the stick and just swim randomly around.  He's always been an independent fellow, almost a loner but still enjoying the comfort of his pack.  So anyway.  Back to the dying part.  Detail was diagnosed with Cushing's Disease about eight months ago.  In a nutshell, it's a tumor on either his adrenal or his pituitary gland that causes an overabundance of cortisone in his body.  He's on meds, but I'm unsure of their therapeutic value.  His muscle mass is wasting away.  His nickname used to be Fat Boy, but not so now.  He can't go down the stairs by himself and often his legs slip out from underneath him.  His coat, once the most beautiful thick soft and shiny fur around, is now thin and wispy.  His wonderful rich bark now sounds more like a mouse squeaking.  He seems embarrassed at the change in his voice because he now uses it even less frequently than before.  They'll be sixteen in August.  If he makes it until then, I'm gonna bake him a cake.  Maybe I should bake it now instead.

      I am so suburban it's almost pathetic.  I derive grand pleasure from rolling the trash bin to the curb on the designated days.  Walking down our long driveway to retrieve the mail from our ever-so-suburban curbside mailbox each afternoon makes me smile.  As do the flowers I planted around the base of said box.  Waving to the neighbors as they travel down the sidewalk pushing their strollers or powerwalking in their jogging outfits is pleasing in a way that defies rational description.

      Wendy plays softball on Monday evenings in the spring and early summer and sometimes in the fall.  The Biohazards, of which she is but one, is her primary team this year.  It's exercise, a social outlet, and she likes playing.  Muchly.  They play two games consecutively on game night.  Slow pitch.  Co-ed.  Seven inning limit with a 10 run slaughter rule, which I think kicks in after the fifth inning.  It's all about having fun. (As an aside, she's cute as hell in her softball uniform.)  The games are in the early evening and may as well be on the moon considering how long it takes to get from here to there during rush hour.  But it's right near her office so it works out just fine for her.  Last Monday were the final "late" night games starting at 8 and 9 pm.  Since we could leave home after rush hour on the Beltway, Dudley and I decided to head up to lend our support and see our girl play ball.  As soon as I pulled out his harness (no collar for Dud, he pulls on the leash too much) he started going apeshit.  This was expected.  And there's nothing more amusing than a basset going apeshit.  Unless you are trying to put his harness on of course.  Then it's frustrating.  He finally sat still long enough for me to put his clothes on and hook up his leash.  Off we went.  Cosi seemed a bit miffed at being left behind but Detail didn't seem to care.  Dud had the back seat all to himself.  At the ballfield, we perched on a hill on the first base side of the field.  He was aware of Wendy out there playing first base and every time he heard her voice, he'd perk.  A perked basset hound is just about the cutest thing on the face of the earth.  He sits up straight, gets an intense look on his face, his ears on high alert.  He looks around purposefully to find the source of his perkiness and then stares intently.  Cute.  Really.  So the Biohazards didn't fare too well that evening.  0-2.  The other team had some serious batters, including two guys that hit the ball over the fence three times.  Geez.  But Wendy played well and was happy to have us there.  She kissed me in the parking lot in front of everyone.  She kissed Dud too but the kiss  I  got was better.  Dudley was exhausted by the end of game 2 and slept in the back seat all the way home.  It takes a lot of energy to perk, after all.  Arriving home, he immediately dragged his tired self to the bed and didn't stir again until morning.  It's a hard life, that of a basset.

      ... how a little ranting can help one feel so much lighter.  Or maybe it was the food.  I know it was not alcohol-induced (it's much too early in the evening for that!).  But it could have been the food.  Whatever it was.  Writing or eating.  It's all good.

      I've spent a great deal of time inside my head attempting to reconcile my feelings on the whole gay-rights-gay-marriage political mess and all the pieces of that puzzle that affect me and mine.  What sent me into my head this time around was a friend asking why I didn't get more involved and active in making change if I did not like what was happening.  Oh shit.  Now there's a loaded question.  Hit me hard and wrong and I immediately felt seriously strong resentment.  And this was AFTER I had requested we not discuss politics because I was uncomfortable with the feelings I knew such discussion would inspire.  The question was not posed maliciously, but rather innocently.  And somehow that made it even worse.  While I've always been a take-care-of-things kind of gal, I do  not  want to have to take care of  this .  I do  not  want to have to become an activist and champion the cause of gay rights in America.  I feel my life as I live it should champion the cause enough.   It should be enough .  But it's not.  Because that's not the way things work.  So I give money to organizations that support "our cause".  I take time to know the politicians for whom I vote and take care to select those that support my own beliefs, or as a minimum compromise, those that are not blatantly anti-gay.  I try to be a good American.  No, I   am   a good American.  And it's just not enough.  What I'm really wrestling with is my growing resentment of friends and family who  say  they disagree with how Virginia and current American political leadership are handling the whole gay marriage thing.  These very folks, who are quite dear to me personally and declare that I am dear to them also, give lip service to how wrong it all is.  They smile and nod sympathetically while continuing their lives status quo.  Then they ask me why I don't do more.  Or they ask when Wendy and I are going to get married.  I'm like, WTF?!  But so what?  Does it really matter?  After all, there has always been room in my heart for people who feel differently than I.  That's the beauty of life.  That's the beauty of America.  How boring it would be if we all felt the same.  But I always thought, despite their differing political views, that I mattered to them.  And things that affected me, their friend, mattered to them too.  However I now cannot escape the reality of their duplicity.  And it pisses me off.  Don't profess to be my friend if you continue to support those working to limit MY rights under our laws and our Constitution.  You know who you are.  I know who you are.  You know who I am.  I am a lesbian and you, through those whom you continue to support, are working feverishly to take away MY right to live free.  And I'm not talking about the religious side of the issue because I respect your freedom of religious belief.  I'm talking about American  civil liberties .  Unfortunately, the middle ground on which we both happily perched while our friendships developed is being eroded away by current events---driven by the very politicians you and yours continue to support.  I'm losing my objectivity.  I may well be losing my friends.  But really, how friendly are they if it's okay with them for me and other people like me to be relegated permanently into second class citizenship?  This is twisting my head and my heart.  I know I should suck it up and quit feeling sorry for myself.  But I'm not there yet because it hurts.  Blech.

         "The sweetest part is acting after making a decision."   --ES   After our chat with The Boy the other day, we decided we are long overdue for a visit.  It's far too easy to let daily life get in the way of what really matters.  Work will be here when we return.  The house project schedule will not suffer irreparably from a short delay.  Our wonderful neighbor can be recruited to tend the animals for a day or two.  It will do all of our hearts good.  So reservations have been made.  Leave has been authorized.  I'll take my own damned car to the Jiffy Lube for the preparatory oil change.  Next week we shall head south and see The Boy in his summer environment!  We'll buy him groceries (and toiletries I'm sure), meet his new friends, grimace at the state of his shared apartment, admire his tan, see him perform, feed him and then feed him again, and, most importantly, hug him as much as he'll tolerate.  And I'll not be the one to say "uncle" first, even if my ribs crack.

      I grew up in the Commonwealth of Virginia. It's been my home since I was four years old. I love this state: the history, the geographic diversity, the peanuts, whatever. It's my home, after all. But I hate Virginia politics. It is impossible to live here and not be aware of how far right the politics are. However Northern Virginia, where we live, is more politically diverse than the rest of the state. Not that it makes that big a difference.   It's never been a good place to be gay. But is there really any place in America where it is  good  to be gay? One can look at the debates regarding gay marriage and civil unions and such and believe that change is happening in America. Being an eternal optimist, I'll even be so bold as to call it progress.   Virginia, however, is about to become the WORST place in America to be gay. We, as a Commonwealth, are moving backward. Our General Assembly in their infinite wisdom passed  urlLink HR 751, The Affirmation of Marriage Act . It takes effect July 1.   It's not particularly surprising to me for Virginia to outlaw any form of civil union or partnership benefits between members of the same sex. Really not surprising at all. Virginia is a very conservative state. But this bill does more than just ban same sex unions or recognition of same sex unions from other states. Due to it's broad language, it can be interpreted to declare null and void ANY contractual agreements between members of the same sex---ANY legal agreements, including medical powers of attorney or contracts to share assets. Any contract between two members of the same sex can be called into question.   Talking Heads agree it is most likely unenforceable under Federal laws. Gee how special. But our Assembly in their infinite wisdom went ahead and passed it anyway. Surely Virginia taxpayers (of which I am one) won't mind their tax dollars spent to defend legal challenges to this law. After all, it's the principle of the thing isn't it? We Virginians are far too moral to ever allow such an atrocity as equal rights for all citizens in  our  state.   Why isn't being a good citizen enough? Why isn't being a good person enough? Why is it that paying taxes and voting and being a caring citizen and raising responsible children and being active in my community is not enough to afford my partner and I equal rights under and access to the law? I might even be satisfied just with the right to just be left alone. Okay, so don't allow gay marriage in Virginia. BUT DON'T TAKE AWAY RIGHTS GIVEN TO ANY OTHER VIRGINIAN JUST BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO SHARE MY LIFE WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.   I just don't get it and it makes me crazy to think about it. Just how un-American can Virginia become?

      We were actually home when The Boy called yesterday.  We had the long overdue relaxed catch-up-on-all-things-Greg-and-listen-to-his-adventures-and-update-him-on-us-and-home conversation.  I can't really describe the sense of peace I feel after chatting with him.  And while I don't understand it fully, I'm embracing it like my long lost blankie.  It's like a leak in my comfort bubble has been patched.  God bless Alexander Graham Bell.

      We were out with our Maryland friends last night, celebrating birthdays from the month of June.  One fellow turned 34 and the other 36.  But that's not what I sat down to write about.  We arrived home rather late, like around 1:00am, then sat and messed around on our computers while winding down.  It was around 2:00 when we finally headed for bed.  I woke up this morning around 7:00 because Cosine was click-clicking around asking for something.  So I blearily let them all out and back in, filled their food dishes and cocooned myself once again in the still warm sheets where my snuggly girlfriend still dozed.  And that's when I had this really weird dream.  I was somewhere, still on earth but a part of earth I did not recognize.  There were quite a few people with me, none that I knew except for my friend Tina.  We preparing for a huge halloweenish type parade or something.  Well we weren't in the parade, but we were part of the parade route.  There was a long series of buildings that had lots of twists and turns and odd hallways with unusually shaped rooms.  We were working feverishly to put up decorations and other such party-like preparations all throughout the maze-like structure.  Tina kept disappearing.  As the time neared for the parade to approach, she came back with a bunch of new decorations and such which required all the work that had already been done to be re-done.  And it had to be done  her  way.  I remember feeling frustrated and a bit perturbed.  She was quite excited and happy, either clueless to how I felt or choosing to ignore it.  I'm not sure which.  Anyway, the parade came through and people were swarming all around enjoying the festivities.  That's when I woke up.  No wonder I'm still tired.  It's not that we stayed up way too late, rather that I spent several hours of what could have been restful sleep running around putting up party decorations one way and then re-doing them another way.  It would exhaust me even further to attempt to analyze this dream, so I don't think I'll bother.  I rarely do.  Bother with dreams that is.

      I've been playing this computer game called Zuma.  I like it because I can sit down and play a few rounds and then just get up and move along with my day.  A quick fix, a coffee break.  It's kind of an Aztec theme, with ancient temples and such.  The player (that would be me) is a frog in the middle of the screen and with a left-click I spit out balls of various colors.  There is a track along which run other balls of various colors.  The tracks change length and configuration depending on the level of play.  Some of the tracks are pretty crazy, looping back and forth and going through tunnels.  New colors of balls are added in as levels progress and the speed of the balls racing around the track increases.  The object is to make chains of at least three balls of the same color.  Toss in "special" balls:  explosion, backward, accuracy, slowdown.  Every so often a coin will appear off to the side and if I can hit it with a ball, I get extra points.  Another object is to not let the balls reach the end of the path and get gobbled up by the Dreaded Gaping Mouth.  Because then the game is lost.  The gaping mouth is to be avoided at all costs.  And as a player advances deeper into the temple, the Zuma speaks:   As for me it is not possible to believe!  Your power namely that is large!  But there is one more temple which you do not find, that the Zuma deeply buried under the land.  It was hidden.  It is the Temple of Secret!  You the final temple must fight in order to take the cover of position of my jail! Makes perfect sense, doesn't it?  My mind seeks a tenuous parallel between the game of Zuma and life.  The object of Zuma is quite clear.  The who what where when why and how are laid out in an orderly progression and one must but decide which colored ball to send in which direction while relying on instinct and reaction to succeed.  Sometimes you make a good shot and other times it goes completely awry.  Can you sense the parallel also or is it just me?  Wendy and I have side by side computers where we sit and each do whatever needs doing and/or whatever our desires decide needs doing and at times discuss whatever it is we are doing while we are doing it.  Works for us.

      Two pets visited the vet for check ups this week.  Figero's test results were again clean and he is now officially off steroids.  No more medicinal dosing torture!  We're supposed to keep a close eye on him and bring him back before we go on vacation at the end of next month for another test to ensure his blood continues to be parasite free.  Easy enough.  Detail we took in just to have another set of eyes look him over.  Because we see him day in and day out, it's difficult to be objective about how far he has deteriorated physically.  He's lost another seven pounds since April and now weighs in at just over one half of his weight before he got sick.  Yikes.  He really IS just skin and bones.  He doesn't eat his regular chow much anymore.  He still drinks plenty of water and enjoys treats and human food, however.  Of late, interaction with him has always been instigated by us which is evidently yet another sign of his decline.  During our discussion with the vet, I was sitting on the floor and Detail climbed into my lap.  He's so sweet, our skinny Fat Boy.  We are his protectors.  Made me feel guilty as we calmly and rationally discussed his fate.  I think he may have known what we were saying.  I hope he knows we love him.  We now have official medical authorization to feed him as many treats as he cares to have.  Now all we have to do is find a discrete way to slip them to him so the other dogs don't demand treats of their own.  They are already getting fat enough from eating his share of regular meals.

      We've been watching bits and pieces of the College World Series this past week or so.  I truly enjoy seeing non-professionals play the game, perhaps the stars of the future before they join the ranks of the highly paid professional players.  And while it  is  baseball, even baseball in a purer form than professional, it is lacking a quality that to me makes baseball really baseball.  It's the sound when a bat makes contact with a ball.  Oh sure, there is something to hear when the ball is hit.  But in the CWS it's a "tink" rather than the ever-so-satisfying-wow-that-ball-is-going-somewhere "crack" of a wooden bat hitting the ball.  It's those damned aluminum bats.  Tink.  Doesn't matter if the ball is sailing over the right field fence or dribbling down the third base line or finding the gap between left and center or just going foul.  Tink.  It's just wrong.

      This creature was resting on our back door.  While I didn't put a ruler to it because I did NOT want to get close enough, Wendy did the math in relation to the width of the door and extrapolated its' wingspan: five inches!!  What does it eat?  Where does it live?  Does it have friends?  Is it here on vacation?  Is it a bird?  Is it a plane?  Is it  Supermoth ?  urlLink     Whatever it is, I think it's pretty cool.  As long as it keeps its' distance.

      I've been poking around other people's blogs and every so often I find one that is worth taking the time to read.  One has to wade through a lot of crap to find something good however.  I've happened upon several references to lesbians without even specifically looking for them.  These references aren't necessarily good or bad or even neutral.  They just are.  Well, some are good.  Maybe even great.  You can judge for yourself.  There's  urlLink this person here , who believes there is an application process to join our ranks.  That's an idea I'll put on par with a license to reproduce (something I've thought of often), but it's really not the most practical idea.  After all, do we need more regulation?  And heck, what if I applied and was rejected?  Where the hell would I be then?  She did, however, put together an interesting list of  urlLink 10 reasons she should become a lesbian .  She left the most important reason off her list.  Anyone want to take a guess at what that may be?  Or  urlLink this person here , who expresses concern because she heard the car she drives is a favorite ride of lesbians.  Personally I don't know any lesbians who drive a CRV, but then again I've already admitted not knowing too many lesbians despite being one myself.  And even if it is true, I wonder why it is a cause for distress?  Or here, where  urlLink this woman  doesn't want to "sound" like a lesbian.  Worry not, bloggette.  Admiring a woman's breasts could actually make you sound more like a man than a lesbian (not that lesbians don't admire other women's breasts... we do... well  I  do!).  Neither comparison is anything to be feared.  I did come across  urlLink this blog , a site I'll be keeping up with maybe out of jealousy or more likely to vicariously re-live my own parenting experiences and to savor the memories.  And then this woman wrote a  urlLink touching tribute  to her lesbian mother on Father's Day.  Well it's not obvious her mother is a lesbian from that particular post, but that fact is documented as Number 4 on her  urlLink 100 Things  list.  I don't intend to ever specifically look for lesbian blogs.  Sometimes it's more rewarding just to stumble around blindly.

      It stands to reason as much as I love books and reading that the library would be a wondrous place to me.  And it is!  Oh how I love to go to the library!  At least I used to.  Before my late fees got out of control... again.  How can I possibly owe the library over $80 in late fees?  And truth be told, I've owed the library over $80 in late fees for well over a year now.  Bah.  Not sure how it happened but it did.  If I wasn't ashamed to admit it, I'd acknowledge it happened because I did not return my books on time.  But $80 of not returning books on time?  That them there represents A LOT of lateness!  The same thing used to happen with video rentals (well not $80 worth, but consistent lateness), but now that we use  urlLink Netflix  we don't have that problem.  Is there such a service for books?  Maybe there should be.  Back when I was a child, every so often the library (the same library I go to now) would offer "Amnesty Day" when all fines were forgiven as long as the books had been returned.  Ah the good old days.  When I asked a librarian about that a while back, she looked down her nose at me and said "oh, we don't do  that  any more!"  She was kind of snotty.  No, actually she was  really  snotty.  I personally think librarians should be open and friendly and welcoming.  I've made a recent resolution to pay off my fines this summer.  I really want to go back and hover around the new releases shelves and peruse new offerings and try authors I've never read before.  The other patrons sometimes offer up opinions that lead to interesting discussions about books they've already read.  Then maybe I'll go back to the other shelves and wander up and down refreshing my memory of things I've read before and maybe even reading them again.  Am I too old to turn over a new leaf and be a more responsible library-book-checker-outer?  I think not... I really want to try.

      Okay so the whole "create a list of all the good things from the past year" idea isn't as easy as I thought it would be.  Not that there is a lack of good things, because the year has had many bright spots.  It's not the actual act of compiling the list but rather the mere  thought  of  thinking about  compiling such a list that seems to weigh so much.  Yeesh. Maybe a nap will help.

      Our company picnic was yesterday.  It rained, but we had a pavilion so it mattered not.  The rain made the sack race a bit more challenging and this year when Phil fell, the mud splash was spectacular.  We had a really cool moonbounce.  It was divided into sections with a ladder and a slide connecting the rooms.  Mad fun.  The kids were adorable.  One can tell quite a bit about people by watching them interact with children.  I was responsible for bringing deviled eggs and water balloons (among other things).  The night before, Wendy peeled three dozen hard boiled eggs for me---no small task (she's the best!).  She and I took turns filling up balloons until we had a huge cooler full.  I think the adults had even more fun than the kids did with the balloons.  I know I did.  My favorite memory of this particular picnic, however, was seeing my vegetarian boss surreptitiously gnawing on one of the delicious barbequed ribs.  Rules are meant to be broken, after all.

      One day last week I went over to my friend Tina's house.  It took me twenty minutes to drive there.  She lives about a mile from us.  Twenty minutes.  Usually takes three.  I could have walked there faster.  There are only two stop signs between here and there.  But the local high school lies directly between our homes.  And it was graduation night for the Class of 2004.  Place was a madhouse.  It got me thinking about this time last year.  Our lives were  so  different.  It's been a difficult year, wrought with change.  And while has been a difficult year for many folks besides myself, I'm writing this from my point of view so it is my difficult year to which I refer.  Last year at this time The Boy had just graduated high school.  He had secured a summer job working at a local water park as a lifeguard.  He had the little blue pickup truck for transportation.  He had a wonderful girlfriend he'd been dating since the summer before.  The decision on which college to attend had been made and funding was in place.  The future then (as does now) stretched out before him like a road paved in gold.  Strong, handsome, smart, talented, healthy and kind.  I was (and still am) so very proud of him.  During his last year of high school we were so busy I could easily postpone considering what life would be like without The Boy around every day.  It was easy enough to put off because I knew I'd have plenty of time to experience it after he left.  Oh sure, I'd seen other parents go through it.  Most  seemed  fine, professing to miss their little darlings while luxuriating in their Glow of Newfound Freedom.    Uh, hello?  It's been almost a year!  Anyone?  Where is   MY   glow?  I'm still anxiously awaiting delivery of My Glow of Newfound Freedom dammit!  Hrumph.  Maybe this is one of those things that Must Be Done By Oneself.  Maybe all this time I've been awaiting delivery of My Glow when I was supposed to go pick it up myself.  Doh.  I think perhaps a good first step in Finding My Glow may be to make a list of all the good things I've experienced in the past year WITHOUT GIVING ANY CONSIDERATION to what my life was like before.  Sounds simple enough.  Okay.  Goals are good.  Now I have a new one.

      It's really quite wonderful when one's children become old enough to help with the mundanities of everyday life.  Being able to say "Son, my car needs an oil change.  Please take it down to the Jiffy Lube for me."  Sending him on that type of errand had two-fold usefulness.  Not only did my auto get the much-needed (most likely overdue) oil change, The Boy became exposed to new experiences and got more comfortable comporting himself therein.  I think it was right before the trip to drop him off at college when I again sent him off with my Camry, sporting it's bright rainbow stickers of course, to the Jiffy Lube.  Now, he had driven my car on many other occasions because it's much more comfortable than the little pickup truck at his disposal.  I'm not really sure how much thought he even gave driving our rainbow-stickered vehicles (although when we turned the little blue pickup truck over to him for his primary use, I did peel off it's rainbow).  He came home from the Jiffy Lube errand with this story.  Well it's not really a story and not really an event and not even particularly interesting, but it is  something .  I just can't pin a word on it.  One of the Jiffy Lube technicians was someone The Boy knew from high school.  This fellow was like "Dude, what's up with the rainbow sticker on your car?  You gay or something?"  The Boy let him know that it was his mother's car and therefore her sticker.  He laughed about it when he got home.  What I learned from this is not to assume that just because the car has a rainbow sticker is not necessarily an indication the occupants are gay.  Maybe they just like rainbows.  Or maybe they are doing a favor for their lesbian mom.  Or gay dad.  Or someone unrelated.  Wish The Boy was home now because my car is yet again due for an oil change.

      I used to believe (and I wasn't shy about verbalizing it) that a person should not complain about their job unless they were willing to take action.  In other words, quit complaining and do something about it.  And now I find myself in that position.  In a job I  really  don't like.  It's bigger than not liking it, more that I get absolutely ZERO personal satisfaction from it.  It's boring.  Repetitive.  Dull.  Someone may take joy in the type of things I have to do at work, but it's not me.  Actually it's the parts of my job that were not parts of my job when I was originally hired that have become so numbing.  There were just a few of the distasteful and dull things when I first went to work there.  And those I could handle because the fun things were more predominant.  But we downsized a tad and someone else's tasks became mine in addition to my original tasks.  And now the boring things outnumber the fun parts and dull my mind so much I don't enjoy much of anything there.  And then I realize how deeply ensnared I am in "the trap".  I am paid  extremely  well.  And enjoy the benefits of full-time employment while working only three days a week.  All the trimmings.  Paid health care, both short and long term disability, parking, life insurance, guaranteed 401(k) contribution, bonuses, vacation, sick and TWELVE paid holidays a year.  How many companies give you July 4th Friday  and  Monday off?  Few.  Very.  And it's but an easy ten mile commute from my home---which really means something in this locale.  I don't have to fill in a timesheet.  Did I mention I can wear jeans and sneakers to work whenever the mood strikes?  But wait!  There's more!  Toss in some truly interesting people to work with.  Folks I've come to respect and admire.  Their business acumen and ethics as well as personally.  Genuinely good people.  It's a true conundrum.  I feel like a whore.  Well not a whore-whore, but a proverbial whore.  You know what I mean?  I fear for my spirit.

      The concert Saturday night was great fun.  It differed from the other Indigo Girls concerts we have attended in several ways.  First, it wasn't at  urlLink Wolftrap  this year.  We instead had to drive all the way to  urlLink Merriweather Post Pavilion  (our Maryland compatriots considered that a bit of a bonus).  The two venues, while similar in that they are pavilions that offer lawn seating, have different rules.  At Wolftrap, patrons can bring in whatever they desire:  coolers, food, any beverage in any container, whatever.  Merriweather only allows you to bring in unopened plastic bottles of water.  They are, however, more than happy to sell you an assortment of food and beverages, such as a 16-ounce beer for $8.  How special.  So we all arrived early and had a picnic in the parking area as a compromise.  And while the usual suspects joined us for this traditional summer outing, we had some new faces join our group.  Our friend Jackie came along as did Sherri, a co-worker of Wendy's (both of them first time Indigo Girls concert-goers).  We missed Katie and Rob and Elena and Susie who were not able to come this year because Katie and Rob have a new son, Elena has a new brother and Susie has a new grandson (you figure out the connection).  We did have a new male representative:  Mary's boyfriend!  He was not made aware that he would be the sole male person among our group, but he handled it just fine.  None of us had met him before and I hope we did not overwhelm him.  (I did refrain from telling him he'd best treat Mary as well as she deserves to be treated or he'd suffer our wrath.  And he would, so he'd better.)  He seems nice and they make a cute couple.  The cell phone activity was interesting also.  The Boy caught up with us in the parking lot on Wendy's cell, rather indignant at the difficulty he'd had at getting in touch with us (inadvertent paybacks perhaps but it would make me really happy to have an uninterrupted quiet phone session with him just to listen to his adventures).  Mary called Hillary who was also somewhere at the concert so she could hook up with us.  Jenny called her boyfriend Tom who was supposed to be hanging out with MariSusan's husband Paul but was not, reason unknown.  Wendy called her mother to confirm that the Riverwalk in San Antonio was indeed on the San Antonio River.  And Jackie called someone twice, once during  Closer to Fine  and again during  Galileo .  But who?  Who was she calling?  And why?  Ah intrigue.  I may have to make up a story about that someday, but not today.  Their set list was fabulous.  A great mix of old and new, and much to Wendy's delight they played their rendition of Dylan's  Tangled Up in Blue .  There was a big video screen that we folks on the lawn could watch and Emily has something going on with her face that is icky.  Amy looked pretty rough, but then she usually does (Wendy opined that she had great arms though, and she does but Wendy's are better).  They sounded incredible, so I reminded myself again (as I do each morning when I look in the mirror?) that looks are not everything.  Rockin' evening it was.  You should have been there.

      I have a wide silly streak.  Wide enough that the "S" in my "Suzanne" acronym could well have been "Silly".  But Wendy pushed for "Sensual" so that was that.  Sometimes when I'm home, either alone or with Wendy home too, I can instantaneously experience incredible silly amusement with our pets.  This is one of my favorites.  I kneel on the floor and hang my head.  This causes a great level of consternation among the dogs because their humans typically do not kneel on the floor and hang their heads.  My puppers gather round and start by poking me with their noses.  They click-clack all around me in circles.  Dudley always gets a little whine going on.  Cosi tosses in a bark or two or three.  They head butt my torso and attempt to lift my chin with their big doggie heads.  Oh, and a tail whipping from Dudley is part of the experience (the other two have cropped tails which are too short to whip with).  I sit there and just laugh.  I wrap it up by gathering them in my arms for a great big group hug.  Simple pleasures.  Good stuff!

      Well it's some kind of sign, and of course my worrying mother mind can turn it into either a good sign OR a bad sign.  In that I am an optimist, I will elect for it to be a good sign.  The Boy called his aunt Sherab last night and chatted for 30 minutes!  She reported to us this morning knowing we'd like to know he'd called.  She said he sounds great, has a really busy schedule and, something we had not yet heard, has landed an understudy role in the production.  Coolest.  It also is heartening to know he is keeping in touch with her.  She adores him.  Like the rest of us.  He did report, however, that performing in the heat in the sweat-inducing period costumes (wool and leather?  egad!) is making it difficult for him to keep on weight.  (Note to self:  send more calorie-laden foods to The Boy.)  This second hand conversation almost makes up for us missing his phone calls all week.  Almost... kinda sorta... but not really.

      Acronyms are not that hard to think up, really.  But I surfed into this site that automatically generates them based on whatever one inputs.  I typed in "Suzanne" and here's what spit out:       S     Square       U     Unnatural       Z     Zonked       A     Ambivalent       N     Normal       N     Neat       E     Exciting        Yikes!  That is SO not me.  While mildly entertaining (heavy stress on the mildly keeping in mind I'm easily amused), those results are contradictory and unsatisfying.  How uninspired?  So I, with some help from Wendy, created an acroynm that suits me better:       S     Sensual       U     Unconventional       Z     Zealous       A     Alpha-Dog       N     Nonchalant       N     Nocturnal       E     Enthusiastic        Yes, that's better.  Much. So have at it, folks.  Maybe it'll get you right?   Name / Username:     urlLink Name Acronym Generator  From  urlLink Go-Quiz.com

      One summer I was on a road trip to Maine to retrieve The Boy.  He had been vacationing with his aunt and cousin as he had several times during several summers of his youth.  His dad's family has owned property up there in the boondocks for generations and it is pretty much their family tradition to summer on Flying Pond (the name is deceptive, it could well be called Flying Lake but perceptions are different up there).  I'm big on family tradition and Maine is a glorious place to while away the summer for a body of any age.  So I'm cruising along a highway in New Jersey (the Garden State Parkway if memory serves).  I was driving my old gray Toyota station wagon proudly displaying my rainbow sticker.  Both Cosine and Detail were with me (summer on the lake in Maine is also great for dogs).  It was a glorious day in New Jersey and I had the window open with my elbow hanging out speeding down the highway singing along with the cassette tape, thinking about nothing except the joy of being alive in the space I currently occupied.  Suddenly my reverie was broken as a car came speeding up out of nowhere, passing on the left and honking madly.  I looked up and the driver, a young lady, was wildly waving at me and displaying the thumbs-up sign as she careened by.  I smiled at her.  I wondered why she was honking and waving and such but then took note of the rainbow sticker on her own bumper.  Now I'm not one to honk and wave when I see another car with a rainbow sticker.  I will glance over and if eye contact is made, I'll smile and maybe nod my head.  But I did enjoy being honked at that day in New Jersey.  Kindred spirits on the open freeway, passing in the night so to speak, but sharing a bond nonetheless.  It made the day even brighter.

      I re-watched  The Shawshank Redemption  on TV last night.  Having seen that movie a number of times, I still enjoy it immensely.  Who couldn't love the happiest of endings?  The true justice meted out to the bad guys?  The strength and perseverance of the characters?  And the quote of all quotes:  "Get busy living or get busy dying".  Sound advice for any given day.

      Okay this is just a bit unnerving.  I was perusing a blog belonging to  urlLink The Most Ancient Suzanne on Earth  (as opposed to me, the Less Ancient Suzanne).  She had a link to this little quiz.  So being bored at work (a somewhat constant state), I clicked and took the quiz and up popped my results:      You're  Siddhartha !   by Hermann Hesse     You simply don't know what to believe, but you're willing to try anything once. Western values, Eastern values, hedonism and minimalism, you've spent some time in every camp. But you still don't have any idea what camp you belong in.  This makes you an individualist of the highest order, but also really lonely. It's time to chill out under a tree. And realize that at least you believe in ferries.     Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .    So why is this freaky?  Well I'll tell ya why.  To the right you'll see a link referencing my sister the Buddhist nun.  She really is a Buddhist nun.  And she really is my sister.  She once gave my son a book about Siddhartha and from my memory, Siddhartha is actually a buddha.  I would NEVER deign to compare myself to a buddha!  It's just wrong.  But maybe it's okay to be compared to a book about a buddha.  I'll have to ask Sherab about it.  But for now, I still find it unnerving.  If I were to be a book, I'd hope to be a hardcover edition.  One with a good heft and quality paper.  I'd like to be in a well-kept library, dusted often and taken off the shelf occasionally to have my pages caressed lovingly while my contents were absorbed and appreciated.

      I have a rainbow sticker on my car.  I will always have a rainbow sticker on my car.  It's a subtle announcement to those that pay attention.  Back in the day, The Boy attended a private Montessori school here in Mount Vernon.  (It was long enough ago that The Boy could now rightfully be called The Man.) During those years, I had a rainbow sticker on my car along with a "hate is not a family value" sticker.  The school had a u-shaped driveway and each morning and afternoon parents waited patiently in a line to drop off or pick up their children.  A friendly staff member was there to help extricate them from the automobile.  And even though I broadcast my gayness with my bumper stickers, I always felt welcome.  Some folks were a bit standoffish but that could have just been their nature, having nothing to do with my sexuality.  I've always tried to give folks the benefit of the doubt.  The Boy, being a bright spongelike student, did very well at school.  The teachers never gave any bad reports: he got along well with others, did his work and behaved like a gentleman.  I did my part, in addition to my other parts, by ensuring he was properly attired in the required uniform, prepared with requisite materials, and toting a healthy lunch.  I provided class snacks on rotation and often accompanied his class as a chaperone on field trips.  (I also trained him to bring me a cup of coffee each morning after he woke up.  Much more effective and pleasant than an alarm clock for me.  And really for him too.  Like I said, bright.  Spongelike.)  One of my favorite field trips was when we went to  urlLink Helmlock Overlook  for an overnight "team building" program.  There was hiking, a ropes course, and a diverse bunch of activities the kids had to complete using teamwork.  Fascinating to watch them problem-solve.  There were at least half a dozen other mothers who came along and we all shared a cabin.  At bedtime, one of the moms fell asleep almost immediately and began snoring like I've never heard anyone snore before.  For some reason this struck me as hysterical and gave me a fit of the giggles.  Maybe it was the unusual way the snore sounded, or maybe I was just tired and feeling giddy.  Either way, my giggles quickly spread around the cabin and soon those who were not sleeping were unsuccessfully stifling giggles of their own.  It felt rather like a slumber party back when I was a kid.  You know what I mean.  The next day, every time I caught sight of the Snoring Mother I had to stifle the giggles again.  Good times, good times.  And the other parents, while aware of me being gay, didn't seem to have a problem with it (or if they did I was blissfully unaware).  It may sound pompous, but I've often felt like an emissary of sorts, setting an example in a hetero world that gay folks are just people too.  I still feel that way.  During his last year there, 7th grade, I co-coached the  urlLink Odyssey of the Mind  program for his class.  I became very good friends with my co-coach Margaret.  Our sons were already friends.  Their family kind of adopted The Boy and me, often inviting us home to share a meal or just hang out.  We spent ALOT of time with the OM team (the entire seventh grade class--all 7 of them) and grew quite close to the students.  I still run into one every now and again and treasure seeing how they've grown into such wonderful young adults.  After the OM competition was over, Margaret and I remained friends.  They lived (still do) in The Land of the Big House, as I call the richer neighborhoods around here with the lavish landscaping and humongous McMansion homes.  They also had a swimming pool and frequently hosted the students for parties and such.  With the class being so small, the students and their parents all bonded into an extended family of sorts.  It was a great time in our lives.  While me being gay surely subjected The Boy to some teasing, the tight group of friends and the assortment of trusted adults helped form a comfortable world in which he could be himself and not be ostracized because his mother was "different".  (I hoped.  I think it worked out okay.)  One afternoon Margaret and I took our sons ice skating at the local rink.  After skating for a while, she and I sat down on the benches to watch the boys do their thing.  She started a conversation about me being gay which caught me completely off guard.  I tried very hard not to freeze up.  It was not a typical topic between us, rather an "I know and I know you know I know but I don't feel the need to discuss it" thing made easier because I was single at the time.  But then she shared with me a rumor she had heard going around the school that I was HIV positive.  WTF?  Bear in mind this was a small school.  By then, The Boy had been a student there for eight years.  I knew everyone and thought they knew me.  But because I was gay, someone decided I must also be HIV positive and other folks were talking about it too!  WTF?  This really threw me for a loop, because it brought into question my relationship with everyone at the school.  How can educated people be such idiots?  Strike that.  How can PEOPLE be such idiots?  So much for my emissary status.  I had been reduced to gossip fodder in the lowest possible way.    Margaret later apologized for telling me once she saw how it affected me.  But I really didn't mind knowing.  It served to remind me that while acceptance may be apparent, under the surface may still reside the basest instincts of human nature.  This is something that now stays in the back of my mind at all times.  I still go about my life as I did before, but I keep in mind that what is on the face may well not be what is in the heart.  Good life lesson I suppose, but one I wish no one had to learn.  There's comfort in naivete.

      I took this pic of a squirrel hanging upside and having a snack in the tree outside our front window.  How the heck is that little critter holding on to that skinny little branch with just his toes?  I had been watching him do death defying leaps as he ran around maniacally jumping from branch to branch to trunk to branch before he settled down to nibble on whatever it is he is nibbling.  I'm thinking it's got to be pretty difficult to swallow when one is hanging upside down.  urlLink

      I am one of the fortunate commuters who gets to drive on the  urlLink George Washington Memorial Parkway .  It offers a scenic and speedy route to Old Town Alexandria where I work three days a week.  We live but a mile or two from  urlLink Mount Vernon Estate  which is at the southern end of the Parkway.  It follows the Potomac River from Mount Vernon to Great Falls where it terminates at the  urlLink Capital Beltway  (the Beltway is best to avoid unless one likes sitting in bumper to bumper traffic no matter what the time of day).  The Parkway has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.  When I was a kid, they used to close off the northbound lanes from Mount Vernon to Alexandria every so often for the public to ride their bikes.  My family used to take many bike rides together as a weekend activity.  Riding on the Parkway was always special because it was awesome to have whole lanes to occupy and it just felt cool.  In 1973, a  urlLink bike trail  was constructed so kids today don't get the opportunity to swerve madly across the lanes and enjoy the bumpity-bump-bump of the seams in the concrete pavement.  Also on the Parkway is a favorite place where we often hung out during my high school years:   urlLink Fort Hunt Park .  Well, I hung out there at other times too, like for Girl Scout camp and other youthful gatherings.  But it was hanging out there during high school when we really had adventures.  The kind you don't want your parents to ever find out about, if you know what I mean.  As the name suggests, the park is the home of an old fort which was originally a coastal defense built in 1897.  I always enjoyed exploring the old buildings and such.   urlLink Fort Washington  is just across the river in Maryland and that's a fun place to explore also.  I noticed today on my way home from work the tiger lilies are in bloom.  That means it's Summer.  When the purple flowers bloom on the trees, it signifies to me Spring has officially arrived and there will be no more cold snaps.  You can probably guess I know Fall has arrived when the leaves, well, fall.  But Winter has always been my all-time favorite.  The trees are bare and the river grim and icy.  I find the vistas inspiring no matter what the season, but Winter on the Parkway moves me like no other.  And no matter what the season, driving the Parkway means I'm close to home and it never fails to comfort me.

      PMS is an irritating and uncontrollable factor in many women's lives.  A household of two women (or even close female friends who don't live together), often will experience this hormonal impairment either at or near the same time.  There is no humor involved.  There is no rational behavior involved.  There is no way to stop and think and be the reasonable people we usually are.  Our household is one of those.  Some months (not every month, just the once-in-a-while-oh-god-stand-back-because-I'm-looking-for-a-fight-and-you're-gonna-give-it-to-me-whether-you-want-to-or-not-goddamnit months), those hormones coursing through my system make me insanely reactive.  To the slightest provocation.  Or maybe even no provocation at all.  Like the sun getting in my eyes and me not having my shades in my purse.  Or the supermarket being out of asparagus when I have a whole meal planned around asparagus.  Or gas costing over $2 a gallon and my tank being empty.  Everyday things that normally I just move right past, accept with grace and seek alternative solutions... well, not an alternative solution for the gas.  That one I just grit my teeth and cough up the dough.  Gas is, unfortunately, more important in my life than asparagus OR my shades.  There are many jokes about men and pregnancy and how they couldn't handle it.  I think that the majority of men  could  handle pregnancy, with labor and the whole child raising thing included even.  I know many men who are strong enough to handle it (well... maybe).  But PMS?  Every 28 days?  Over and over month in and month out for over 40 years of their lives?  Childbirth they may survive, but if PMS hit them every month it would drop them in their tracks.

      Our world is back in balance.  Well mostly anyway.  I just delivered a steaming cup of coffee to my sleepy girlfriend in her weekend mug.  Sitting next to my keyboard is my weekend mug, filled with the dark rich brew certain to open my eyelids and inspire me to be a productive member of society.  Our weekend mugs are from Disneyland and were a gift for taking care of a teenager for a week several years ago.  He was pretty low maintenance, well behaved and polite, used to being on a short leash.  I'm sure he enjoyed the modicum of additional freedom while his mom was out of town.  Our home was a little (most likely A LOT) more laid back than his.  Our parenting style afforded a bit more independence.  When his mom came back, she brought us these mugs as a thank you.  Mine is yellow inside and out with a picture of Pooh.  Wendy's is off-white on the inside and black on the outside with a picture of Tigger.  The mugs have a nice balance and are somewhat oversized.  Not oversized in a way that makes the contents cool off faster, as some mugs can be.  These are just taller than the average mug.  That's why they became our weekend mugs, necessitating fewer trips to the kitchen for refills.  So firmly is their status as weekend mugs entrenched, I don't think we'd ever dare use them during the week.  It would just be wrong.  The Boy never used them when he lived at home either.  It was an unspoken rule of sorts:  keep your mitts off our weekend mugs.  He was intuitive that way.  So while this day has dawned dark, gray and hazy outside, inside we are full of sunshine and happiness.  The weekend mugs are filled with coffee and during this treasured weekend morning ritual, all is right in our world.

      Dinner and a movie.  I think those two activities make up a pleasant evening out for all ages, sizes, and personalities.  Makes a good combo.  The only other lesbian couple we know double-dated with us.  They are a hoot.  Bonnie had purchased a cat stroller and expects Rose to take the cat jogging with her.  Rose was less than thrilled with this proposition, but I hope she tries it at least once.  It may be fun and the cat may even enjoy it.  We dined at the Majestic Cafe in Old Town.  Wendy and I had never been there before, but I walk past it frequently on the days I work down there.  Due to the influence of our dining buddies, we started the meal with martinis.  Rose sounded like she knew what she was talking about:  Stoli martini, straight up with extra green olives.  Appealing  enough for us all to order one.  Yummy.  I ate catfish cooked to moist tender perfection and topped with something crunchy.  Not sure what.  It came with a type of squash none of us had ever heard of before:  chayote.  It has a texture similar to cucumber and a very delicate flavor.  Quite tasty.  Wendy had a steak accompanied by some mushroom risotto patties.  Then we saw  The Stepford Wives .  Laughed often and it served the purpose of an entertaining distraction.  Bette Midler has always been a favorite of mine.  Socialization is important: it gives perspective.  Or maybe rather keeps perspective more focused.  It's too easy to get wrapped up into one's self.  There's a whole wide world out there full of people worth getting to know and it's nice to be a part of it.

      Short work day today, unrelated to the National Day of Mourning our country is recognizing.  I personally don't feel particularly mournful.  I usually try to make my Friday's easy days because, well... because I can.  On my way home, I pulled through the McDonald's drive-in for my favorite PMS Special:  a number 9 with a bottle of water.  Still had fries left when I arrived home, so I settled into The Green Chair with my flock gathered around.  One fry for Detail, one for Cosi, one for Dudley, one for Figero, and several with ketchup for me.  Chew, swallow, smile, and repeat.  Who knew the cat liked french fries?  Fig eagerly snatched each offering from my fingers and took his prize into the kitchen to devour it in peace.  Then he'd return for another.  The dogs are another story.  When Detail is offered a treat, one must be careful or one's whole hand will get swallowed.  Cosi, being of the fairer sex, is much more delicate.  Dud positions himself a bit in back of the others, ears perked, and catches each one as it is tossed his direction.  They don't move away until I give the "all gone" sign.  All that's missing right now is my girlfriend, who has a real job and has to work real work days on Friday.  In fact, I do believe Fridays can be some of her most difficult days.  Hang in there, my dear.  Home awaits.

      I learned at an early age to relate to others by teasing.  My father is the champion teaser of all time and such was the basis of our relationship.  I have carried that over, for better or worse, to my relationship with my son.  Being the bright lad that he was and is, he jumped right on board the Teasing Train.    My hair started turning gray at the youthful age of 23, soon after The Boy was born.  There is to me an obvious connection between motherhood and gray hair.  I am also a natural born worrier which doomed me even faster.  We'll not touch on the other things going on in my life when the change began in earnest, but those factors also played a role.  My parents both waited until the regular old age factor kicked in for their hair to gray.  In fact, I'm fairly certain my hair is now grayer than both of them put together.  Oh, the injustice.    If I wasn't so lazy perhaps I'd dye it.  But to a woman who doesn't even own a hair brush (naturally curly hair rocks!), adding any type of maintenance beyond a haircut every six weeks or so is an anathema.  The Boy occasionally called me "Q Tip", a reference of course to the color of my hair and the resemblance to the cotton on top of those little sticks.  Cute perhaps, and since I was instrumental in teaching him to tease I could but laugh.  On the way home from the grocery store after re-stocking our supply of fudgesicles this week, I happened upon a PT Cruiser putzing along in the right lane.  As I neared, the license plate caught my eye and brought a smile to my face.  That's right.  It was "Q TIP"!  I knew what I would see when I glanced at the driver and sure enough, there atop her head was a poof of white hair and nothing else.  A sense of humor sure makes life easier, doesn't it?

       urlLink Bizarre story from Japan  excerpted from cnn.com:   "TOKYO, Japan (AP) -- The decomposed body of a man dressed in pajamas was discovered in an abandoned Tokyo apartment building 20 years after he is believed to have died, police said Thursday ... The man, identified only as former worker of the company that built the apartments, was in his mid-50s when he divorced his wife, left home and moved into the building in the early 1980s, the official said ... The man's remains have been returned to his ex-wife."  That's where my brain started to twist.  It's rather painful.  Imagine:  You are a woman.  A Japanese woman.  In your culture, family is everything.  Your husband divorces you and moves out.  You may or may not have attempted to contact him during that period, but it's been at least 20 years since you've seen or spoken to him.  Maybe you've been raising his kids and taking care of his parents as well as your own during that time.  The authorities find his body and return it to you.  What in the hell do you do with it?  Then again, maybe she killed him in a rage after he spurned her and left him rotting in that apartment building.  Maybe she is taking a perverse joy in his long-since-decomposed-nothing-left-but-bones-in-pajamas being found in such an undignified situation.  Maybe she's happy because now she has actual proof of his death and can collect the life insurance.  Maybe she hadn't even noticed he was gone.  Here's where I really need good ole  urlLink Paul Harvey .  Then I'd know The Rest Of The Story.

Not a care in the world except where my next gallon of fry oil is coming from.  I can envision pulling up behind the only chinese food restaurant in town and negotiating in my broken mandarin for their old cooking oil.  I'm hearing strains of The Who's  Magic Bus  playing in my head and I feel a grand desire to be a hippie in the sixties.

      Sunday, after we'd been working hard all day (and the beat goes on), we decided to treat ourselves with  urlLink Wing Stop  wings for dinner.  Nothing like a good healthful choice after all (hey, we'd been working HARD!)  We ordered some carrot and celery sticks also to at least eat something resembling a vegetable.  Wing Stop's Crispy Vegetable Sticks are a simple combo of carrots and celery.  They are always fresh and truly the crispiest of the crisp.  It's like it was designed just for Wendy and me as she doesn't much like raw carrots and I don't much like raw celery.  Match made in heaven.  We just ordered the regular hot variety of wings although they offer some interesting other flavors.  I've not yet met a Wing Stop wing I didn't like.  There is something that invokes a primitive feeling when devouring chicken wings.  Eating with one's hands and ripping into the small wings with one's teeth feels raw and primordial, but in a good way.  We both like them slathered heavily with bleu cheese dressing.  Nothing left but a pile of gnawed on bones devoid of flesh.  Grrrowllll!  Yum!  Anyway, that night I was the one to phone in the order.  Sometimes we negotiate to see who's gonna go pick them up.  Or one of us volunteers.  Or sometimes we go together and we both like it that way.    This was not the first time we have ordered from this restaurant.  We usually treat ourselves every few weeks or when the mood strikes.  The last time I called Wing Stop and we arrived to retrieve the wings, instead of being under the name I gave them (Suzanne) they were under the name of Sam.  How in-ter-resting.  I see many variations of my name when folks write it down.  I've been Sue, Suzi, Susan (often), Suzzane (more often than is reasonable), Susanna and many aberrations of listed renditions.  But never have I been Sam.  I do have a rather deep voice for a woman (I prefer the term sultry rather than deep, if truth be told).  It is not unusual for me to be mistaken for one of the male persuasion on the phone.  Never in person, but occasionally on the phone.  But Sam from Suzanne?  For some reason, this time it left me feeling more than a little sensitive.  So.  Fast forward to me phoning in this order.  When the nice Wing Stop order-taker answered, I told her I'd like to place an order.  But I upped the octave of my voice a notch or two, shy of a falsetto but significantly higher than it really is.  Wendy was  seated in her office chair just next to mine and her head whipped around at the sound of my voice.  I was mildly embarrassed at my charade and she was majorly amused.  Silly Sam I am.

      So there's this line of pre-packaged little biscotti made by  urlLink Mamma Says .  About two bites per cookie, unless you're nibbling instead of biting.  They resemble fortune cookies, not because they taste like fortune cookies or look like fortune cookies or get delivered along with your chinese food carryout, rather because each one comes with a "Momma Says" fortune-like saying inside.  My favorite saying so far, after eating a veritable truckload of those tasty little morsels over the years, is  "Maturity is knowing when and where to be immature."   By that measure, I may be rapidly approaching full maturity.  Of late, I've only had to pull my foot out of my mouth and/or apologize for my behavior once or twice a month instead of once or twice a day.  Progress is good?

      We need a law against bad spellers.  No.  Strike that.  We have too many laws already.  But something needs to be done.  Our language should not be reduced to a hooked-on-phonics mentality.  Sure, we may be able to decipher what word was intended just by sounding it out, but is that good enough?  I think not.  When I misspell a word, I'm usually aware of it when it happens.  Isn't everyone?  It just FEELS wrong.  I then take the time to jet on over to  urlLink dictionary.com  and confirm the proper way to spell it.  How hard is that?

      The Boy just called me for a recipe:  my now famous spinach artichoke dip.  Instant joy!  He still needs me after all, even if it is just to be his recipe reference.  I'll take what I can get.  And just in case anyone else is in need of a recipe, I shall graciously share this one:   1 box frozen spinach 1 cup grated parmesan cheese 1 8-ounce package of cream cheese 1 cup mayonnaise 1 15-ounce can artichoke hearts (not marinated)   Put the cream cheese on the counter to get soft while you do the prep.   Cook the spinach then squeeze it out, small handful by small handful until it is fairly dry.   Open and drain the artichoke hearts.  Chop them into small pieces.  Squeeze them by small handfuls to get some of the moisture out.   Holding back a little of the parmesan, mix all ingredients in a largish-bowl.  Make sure the cream cheese is mashed well in with the other ingredients.   Spread into a shallow dish (like a 6x8 casserole or a bowl works too but then it must be baked longer).  Sprinkle the top with the held back parmesan.   Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes (or more if it's deeper dish).  It's ready when it's kinda toasty on top and around the edges.  It'll smell delish too.   Serve with whatever cracker or chip strikes your fancy.  We like to use garlic Ritz crackers.   Memorize the recipe so you'll be ready when your son is away for the summer and needs it for a party.  Be glad he's not bringing the beer.

      So it's not all supposed to be about pets dying but that seems the theme of our lives this summer.  Detail we know about.  Cosine, while the same age, has always seemed rather immortal to me.  Aged, but going strong.  Seems that may not be the case.  Figero has also been a constant and I fully expect him to be around forever (I like to fool myself because then I don't have to think about the alternative).  Medicine has always seemed rather mysterious and not particularly reliable to me.  Kinda like voodoo but with a basis in science.  I've never trusted science.  While logical, it's too variable.  This MAY happen, but then again it may not.  This should work, but might not.  Let's just try it and see.  Life as one big science experiment.  So Detail's definitely on his way out.  He's just waiting for us to make the determination that his quality of life is no longer worth living.  I do not like playing god.  It's just wrong.  Figero, seemingly recovered from the blood parasite (WTF?) which just about killed him a few months ago, is still on steroids and who knows what effect that is having on his being.  A cat can most likely live a very long time with no hair on his ears, so what am I worried about?  This weekend Cosine is showing signs of something not quite right.  Maybe something seriously not right.  We're in for more tests and trial and error treatment and who the hells knows what else.  The only certainty is that our checkbooks will get a workout and Cosine will still die at some point.  Three pets nearing the end of their lives within a year of the only human child leaving for college is just piss poor planning.  I pride myself on thinking ahead and laying out strategies and good plans.  Why did I not consider the timing of their deaths as the decisions to have them join the family were made?  I won't make that same mistake again.  I'll think ahead to 10, 15, 20 years down the road and extrapolate where our lives will be as any new pet may be nearing the end of theirs.  My foresight will, of course, be accurate and reliable.  Fuck that "best laid plans" shit.  I'm gonna get it right.  Yes I am the model of rational thinking and practicality.  Emotion should remain where it belongs:  secondary to the business of living.  Did I mention I'm good at fooling myself?

      Our menagerie.  Not the greatest photos, but I'm not the greatest photographer.  Wait.  I didn't take these pictures.  Wendy shot both of them.  That means I'm still in the running for photographer of the year!  This is Detail and Cosine on the landing where they spend a great deal of time napping.  They are obviously not napping here, rather just keeping an eye on their abode.  Detail's the one with the shiny eyes.  In person, his eyes look normal.  urlLink     This is the infamous Green Chair.  It used to belong to my grandfather.  He'd sit in it and watch endless hours of football, much to my grandmother's chagrin.  Now I get to sit in it and watch endless hours of football since he hasn't needed it for many many years.  Isn't that green upholstery the absolutely worst thing you've ever seen?  It doesn't match anything else in the room and it clashes with my favorite green sweatshirt.  I still love that chair though.  Memories are good.  Dudley the basset hound has assumed the position he loves to assume whenever anyone sits there.  Figero the cat is gracing me with his presence and demanding a stroke or two.  I'm happy to oblige.  urlLink

      I went to 7-11 to purchase beer tonight and my change was $1.23.  I like sequential numbers and for some reason feel they are good omens.  This bodes well for the weekend.

      A cartoon lifted from the  urlLink Get Your War On  site.    Folks, no doubt America needs new leadership.  This is beyond Republican versus Democrat.  Our founding fathers made separation of church and state a priority for a reason.  A good one.  And yeah, I think he would have rolled over.  Maybe even spun out of control.    urlLink

      My friend Caren sent me this quote in an email not too long ago.  Such truth both in plain sight as well as between the lines.   "Whenever I dwell for any length of time on my own shortcomings, they gradually begin to seem mild, harmless, rather engaging little things, not at all like the glaring defects in other people's characters."  ---Margaret Halsey    I love my shortcomings.  They are mine and mine alone.  I refuse to share so don't even bother asking.

      Twice a month, sometimes three times, I visit a client in downtown DC.  I like it that I get to go into the city regularly but not so frequently that the commute becomes a drag.  When I drive in, I pay $12 plus a $1 tip to the attendant for parking.  My garage of choice is located in an alley.  The folks there are very nice and take good care of my car (hell, they ought to for the exorbitant price charged for few hours parking!).  Despite the fact I park there infrequently, the attendants always remember my car.  They see me coming and race off to retrieve it for me.  How the hell do they remember what kind of car I drive?  Kinda freaks me out, but in a good way.  The alley itself is an interesting microcosm of city life.  There are dumpsters that occasionally smell bad.  I'm not sure it could officially qualify as a city alley without the dumpsters.  I often have to weave in and around delivery trucks as I walk.  There is a Subway sandwich shop that vents into the alley and in the morning I can often smell the bread baking.  Yum.  Interesting dichotomy between the dumpster smell and the scent of the bread.  This past winter, there was a homeless fellow living in one of the many dingy back entrances to the surrounding buildings.  He had quite an assortment of possessions including a bicycle.  While I was waiting for my car one afternoon, I watched him settle in and pull a large piece of cardboard over the entrance.  Cozy enough I guess but not a place I'd like to spend a cold winter night.  I saw him on several visits and then he was gone.    Sometimes I take the subway instead of driving.  There are good and bad parts of a public transportation commute, but I've gotten it down to a science that eliminates much of the bad.  Parking at the station can be a challenge.  The best spots are reserved for carpools or folks who purchase parking passes.  If I time my arrival after 9:30 a.m. when the restrictions on those spaces lift, I can get a decent spot in the garage.  I also avoid paying the rush hour premium fare.  All hail flex time?  One of my favorite parts of riding the Metro is that I get to read uninterrupted.  I'm one of those commuters who buries her nose in a book and doesn't put it down until she reaches street level again.  I take that back.  I do look up during one part of the ride:  when the train leaves the Pentagon station (and conversely L'Enfant Plaza on the trip home) and emerges into daylight to cross the Potomac River.  I sit there grinning like an idiot surveying the various cityscapes I can see from the bridge.  I like the Rosslyn skyline and the pair of towering buildings that used to be the USA Today buildings.  One was still under construction when I worked in Rosslyn way back when.  I don't know what they are called now.  And there is Washington, DC:  the monuments, all the construction cranes and such, the cherry trees stretching along to Haines Point (breathtaking in spring), and, of course, the river itself.  Being borderline superstitious and more than a little obsessive-compulsive about some things, I have a routine that must be observed.  It is imperative to be watching when the Jefferson Memorial lines up in front of the Washington Monument just before the train heads back underground (or conversely just as it emerges on the trip home).  It's almost phallic when they are fully aligned.  No, check that.  It  is  phallic.  The one time I was too absorbed in my book (damn but that Robin Hobb can weave a tale!) to look up, my book disappeared before I got home.  I lost the goddamn thing!  Still don't know what happened to it, it was just gone.  But now I am quite careful to take the time to pay attention to the sights when crossing the bridge and have not lost a book since.  The train bridge runs parallel to the 14th Street bridge.  I will always remember the winter a plane crashed into that bridge during a massive snow storm and the adventure I had getting home from my job in Rosslyn that night.  On one commute this past winter, there was a chatty tourist seated next to me on the inbound train.  When I looked up and smiled my goofy grin at the ice-covered vista of the river, she asked me if it froze often.  I replied yes, every winter, and blurted out how beautiful it looked to me.  She nodded, seeming to agree.

      Even though she was already up and dressed and ready to leave the house, my girlfriend plaintively said to me this morning as I was just waking up "Let's call in sick today!".  Oh how appealing.  Would have been sooooooo easy to say okay.  She would have gotten back into bed and we could have snuggled the day away.  Damn.  Being responsible can be overrated.

      When I was a young girl, I adored reading  urlLink Nancy Drew  stories.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure my mother got me started because mom's&nbsp;can be&nbsp;cool that way.&nbsp; Reading is one of the nicest things you can do for a child.&nbsp; I don't know how old I was when I first starting reading the series, but I amassed quite the collection over the years of my childhood.&nbsp; I'd read them over and over, again and again, never tiring of the scintillating captivating exciting riveting stories of Nancy and her posse.&nbsp; I'd read them in the bathtub.&nbsp; Under the covers at night when I was supposed to be sleeping.&nbsp; In the car on family trips.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nestled in the "Y" high up&nbsp;in the willow tree.&nbsp; Anywhere and everywhere.&nbsp; The matching yellow-covered&nbsp;books lined the shelf in my room.&nbsp;&nbsp;Always in order:&nbsp; Volumes 1 through 30.&nbsp; Visually pleasing, also.   As I got older, I moved on to reading other things.&nbsp; More age appropriate and such.&nbsp; But I still had those books lining my shelves.&nbsp; And it still brought me great satisfaction to see them there.   When&nbsp;I moved out of my parent's house, I, as many departing children often do, left behind some of my possessions.&nbsp; After all, isn't&nbsp;a parent's house a permanent storage unit in which to keep&nbsp;the things you don't want to haul around from place to place to place?&nbsp; Stuff you don't want to get rid of but you don't necessarily need?&nbsp; That's right, of course it is.&nbsp; At least for a while.   But&nbsp;then my folks announced they were moving!&nbsp; Oh the horror!&nbsp;&nbsp;And it would get worse.&nbsp; Before they moved they had a yard sale.&nbsp; Because that is what one does before one moves.   I'm not sure how much time passed between their yard sale and&nbsp;an ensuing conversation with my mom.&nbsp; It was before they actually moved.&nbsp; And somehow my Nancy Drew collection came up.&nbsp; Maybe you can feel it coming.&nbsp; I sure didn't.&nbsp; They had sold my Nancy Drew books at the yard sale!&nbsp; OMG!&nbsp; I actually cried.&nbsp; There I was, 19 years old, crying because&nbsp;the Nancy Drew collection&nbsp;I adored throughout&nbsp;my childhood but hadn't looked at for years had been sold out from under me.&nbsp; I think my mom cried too.&nbsp; Because she hadn't considered how special those books were to me.   Fast forward to maybe three years later.&nbsp; We were visiting my folk's new home in Norfolk, Virginia for the holidays.&nbsp; Christmas morning dawned.&nbsp; Maybe you&nbsp;can feel it coming.&nbsp; I sure didn't.&nbsp; I&nbsp;unwrapped a heavy box from Santa and inside... ayup!&nbsp; A whole collection of Nancy Drew, Volumes 1-30!&nbsp; The same familiar books with the same familiar yellow covers with the same familiar cheesy pictures on the covers and the same familiar stories inside.   So I've&nbsp;got a collection of Nancy Drew mysteries, Volumes 1-30, that I'll haul around with me&nbsp;forever.&nbsp; And display on my bookshelves always.&nbsp; Because mom's&nbsp;can be&nbsp;cool that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like mine.

      Wendy and I like to snack. Sometimes when a full blown meal either seems like too much work or too much food, we snack instead. We don't always select our snacks based on nutritive value, rather snacks that satisfy the craving one or the other or both of us is experiencing. Women crave often. At least these women do.&nbsp;   One of our favorite snacks are these hors d'oeuvre thingies called Firecrackers. We can only purchase them at Safeway&nbsp;as they are a store brand. Their name could be derived from their shape but probably more from their ingredients: they are fiery crisy&nbsp;spicy hot rolls of goodness! I think the shape came after the taste.&nbsp;&nbsp;They primarily consist of shredded beef, jalapenos and cheese wrapped in a plain brown wrapper.   While we  could  eat those Firecrackers plain, we'd rather dip them in something. Wendy's sauce of preference is picante sauce.&nbsp; Pace Picante Sauce.&nbsp; Medium. Not that chunky crap. Mine is... I'll give you one guess... sweet&nbsp;& sour! I adore slathering my Firecrackers with LaChoy's Sweet&nbsp;& Sour Sauce.&nbsp; But while we use picante sauce&nbsp;for many other reasons, LaChoy's is only used for Firecrackers.   Grocery shopping has been more than a little weird for me since The Boy left for college last&nbsp;fall.&nbsp; A great deal of maternal satisfaction was derived from stocking our pantry with food he enjoyed as well as preparing that food for our family meals.&nbsp; All of a sudden I had to adjust to shopping and cooking for just the two of us.&nbsp; Who knew it would be so difficult to adapt?&nbsp; I must have missed that memo.&nbsp; For months I could not even&nbsp;pull&nbsp;into Safeway's&nbsp;parking lot without feeling a&nbsp;heavy&nbsp;weight bearing down and&nbsp;my eyes getting teary.&nbsp; How bizarre.&nbsp; Especially for me.&nbsp; Walking into the store was an even greater challenge.&nbsp; To actually face&nbsp;meal planning and product selection?&nbsp; The strain was enormous.&nbsp; Elephantine.&nbsp; It's gotten easier of late.&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually again can&nbsp;whistle on my way into the store these days.&nbsp; Progress has been made.&nbsp; In some ways, it's even good.&nbsp; Like now I buy corn on the cob because Wendy and I both like it while&nbsp;The Boy never did.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  During those months of adjustment,&nbsp;I'd find myself pushing my cart up and down the&nbsp;grocery store&nbsp;aisles mindlessly.&nbsp; I'd try to focus on picking up items I knew Wendy liked as well as things I liked and things we should eat while trying not to burst into tears.  It sounds so dramatic but it's really how it was! I kept us well supplied with Firecrackers and fudgesicles and Utz corn chips.  Oh, and of course Pace Picante Sauce and my beloved LaChoy's.  I continued to prepare regular meals, maybe three times a week instead of every day.  While picking up necessary items for a full meal, I'd also pick up those favorite snack items.  Because the cart seemed so barren and empty.  Food for two doesn't take up much space at all.   One&nbsp;result&nbsp;of my shopping&nbsp;"issue"&nbsp;is&nbsp;that&nbsp;we now have a year or more supply of LaChoy's Sweet & Sour Sauce.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was putting away groceries&nbsp;last month, I noticed&nbsp;three other bottles already on the shelf.&nbsp; Yeesh.&nbsp; Now there's four.  &nbsp;  There are, by design, eight&nbsp;Firecrackers in a box.&nbsp; This makes a great snack for two.&nbsp; Not too much, not too little.&nbsp; Once when I opened the box and&nbsp;spread them out on the baking sheet, there were  nine  in one box!  Score!  And here is an example of how simple (pathetic? no, simple!) my life really is.  I was so excited by that extra Firecracker, I ran to share the news with Wendy.  When they were finished baking, I carefully split the oddball in half to share the unexpected bounty.  I've thought of how horrible it would be if there were only, say, seven in the box.  Ever since that first time, I secretly hope to again find nine.  And that's one reason I'm writing about Firecrackers today.  Wendy and I&nbsp;snacked on some last Saturday.&nbsp; As we munched, I&nbsp;asked&nbsp;her if she recalled the time&nbsp;I found nine in a box.&nbsp; She said&nbsp;yes.&nbsp; Then I&nbsp;told her of my secret yearning to again find nine.  Wendy said "I have!"  I said "Huh?"  She blushed.  See I'm not always in charge of baking the Firecrackers.&nbsp; We take turns.&nbsp; And I guess sharing sometimes&nbsp;takes a back seat to hunger.... hmmm.

      Why is it that&nbsp;novels featuring lesbian characters cost so much more than&nbsp;other&nbsp;novels&nbsp;not&nbsp;featuring lesbian characters?&nbsp; And why do I even buy them?&nbsp; Honestly, there are but a scant few writers&nbsp;creating&nbsp;lesbian characters who, in my own humble opinion, can even craft a story worthy of the paper on which&nbsp;they are&nbsp;printed.&nbsp; Yet unfortunately they are as prolific as romance novels and their content similar in quality.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;to add insult to injury, the books&nbsp;cost&nbsp;close to&nbsp;$20 for a thin paperback.&nbsp; And most of them&nbsp;just plain suck.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I know I know.&nbsp; It sounds harsh.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;acknowledge it's hard to write a novel.&nbsp; Or I imagine it would be as I have never done it.&nbsp; I just expect if something actually gets published, it ought to be worth reading.&nbsp; At least one in ten.&nbsp; While it may not appear so, I do respect those who have gone the distance to get their works into print.   We read  a lot .&nbsp; Usually I'm pretty good at picking out authors.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have been rewarded and pleasantly surprised many times&nbsp;just blindly choosing a book based on such ridiculous factors as the way it feels in my hand or the font in which it is printed.&nbsp; Only once&nbsp;did I score such a&nbsp;prize with lesbian fiction.   I was out&nbsp;shopping at Border's one Saturday morning a few years back, ostensibly to purchase the summer reading required for The Boy's upcoming English class.&nbsp; And I did purchase those. But I also wandered around fondling and perusing other texts while absorbing the ambiance of the bookstore. Bookstores feel good. Almost as good as libraries.   As I neared the register, I paused to&nbsp;scan the "all books $1" table. Never hurts to look. A book caught my eye and I picked it up: " urlLink Tropical Storm " by Melissa Good.&nbsp; The cover wasn't particularly impressive, but the size was just right. An overlarge paperback, you know what I mean?&nbsp; Not overlarge as in really thick, but overlarge as in bigger dimensions than typical paperback-sized. As I read the synopsis on the back cover it was impossible not to recognize that&nbsp;in my hand I was holding a volume of lesbian fiction.&nbsp; At Border's no less.&nbsp; And on the $1 table.&nbsp; So it was coming home with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat like purchasing a lottery ticket.&nbsp;   I began reading it that evening.&nbsp; With stories featuring lesbian protagonists, there seems to be a predictable template with minor variations. The city may change. The age of the characters may vary. But typically there is a strong tall dark-haired woman who in some way becomes involved in some way or another with a petite blonde woman and solves all her problems as they fall passionately in love. Or vice versa blonde brunette.&nbsp; Maybe a redhead tossed in every so often.&nbsp; But redheads are usually the evil characters.&nbsp; "Tropical Storm," while following that pattern, also has a reasonably interesting story line and the characters  feel  real. It sucked me in.  &nbsp;  One day shortly after I&nbsp;started that book, I&nbsp;found myself sitting in my car at the Vienna Metro station waiting for Wendy.&nbsp; We, along with&nbsp;other friends who were also meeting us at the Metro, would then drive out to&nbsp; urlLink Nissan Pavilion  to see a trio of over-the-hill rock bands:&nbsp; Styx, Billy Squire and Bad Company.&nbsp; Why you may ask?&nbsp; Well why not?&nbsp; Wendy thinks it was because our now mostly bald-headed friend Tom was missing his mullet days.  &nbsp;  I had&nbsp;brought along the book to read while I waited.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wendy arrived ahead of the rest of the group and joined me in my car.&nbsp;&nbsp;She&nbsp;didn't bring a book&nbsp;of her own.&nbsp; And&nbsp;I was having a difficult time tearing myself away from my story.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't long before Wendy&nbsp;was behaving in a rather petulant basset hound manner, expressing her&nbsp;displeasure that  I  had something to read and  she  didn't.&nbsp; I suppose it didn't help that I commented on how much I was enjoying&nbsp;my book and how I&nbsp;thought I may have&nbsp;finally found an author who could write&nbsp;decent lesbian fiction.&nbsp; My absorption was apparent.&nbsp; I&nbsp;jokingly offered to tear&nbsp;the book&nbsp;in half&nbsp;so she'd have something to read too.&nbsp; She perked!&nbsp;&nbsp;Greatly.&nbsp; And so it was that my&nbsp;one dollar&nbsp;book became two fifty-cent books.&nbsp;&nbsp;Life was good as we both read&nbsp;absorbedly until our friends arrived.  Turns out Melissa Good got her start writing Xena: Warrior Princess fan fiction.&nbsp; Now there's something I didn't need to know.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;knowing that, it is so obvious that her characters Dar and Kerry are patterned after Xena and Gabrielle.&nbsp; Ack well.   We have since replaced the torn book with another copy (for which we paid full price). The sequels in the series are entertaining but have never captivated us as fully as the first. And you can bet I always scan the $1 table with a more careful eye. Who knows what treasures are to be found within?

      It has begun. My new game with the dogs. They initiated it. It's been a bit weird adjusting to our reduced numbers, so whenever they ask for anything they get it. I'll give them both credit for this new distraction.   It starts with me sitting at my computer. Cosine comes up under the desk and noses her head into my lap. This pushes my chair back a little since it's on wheels like most office chairs. So I pet Cosine. Then Dudley comes over and&nbsp;puts his nose in my lap next to Cosine's. And I pet him too. After all, isn't that one advantage of having two hands? But Dud doesn't stop there (need I remind you he's a basset hound?). Not content with merely his head in my lap, a stumpy little front leg with a big old paw at the end followed quickly by another stumpy little front leg with a big old front paw at the end find their way onto the edge of the chair. This pushes me back even further. Chairs with wheels on hardwood floors are like that. Wheely.&nbsp; Dudley quickly has his whole head and part of his body in my lap.   Before I know it I'm moving at a rather rapid pace. Or rather the chair is moving and I'm moving as a consequence of actually being seated in said chair. Cosine is pushing with her chest and Dudley propelling us more merely by trying to keep his paws on the front of the chair and his head in my lap. Tails are wagging furiously at this point. My hands are petting whole dog bodies now. My chair is rolling and I'm petting and dogs are wiggling.   Soon my chair is backed into the wall and the whole thing dissolves into a great big doggie love fest. Good game, yes?&nbsp; &nbsp;

      The post title is compliments of our friend Tina, as she has so dubbed Wendy and my weekend habit of watching re-runs of 90210.   It's true. We do it. And we aren't overly shy about admitting it. There's not much TV selection on Saturday and Sunday mornings. We only have like 100 or more channels from which to choose after all. And we enjoy watching  something  as we lay around sipping our weekend coffee and prepare to face the day. Cartoons have gotten so complex they go right over our heads and&nbsp;demand actual concentration to follow. We&nbsp;require something more basic. Like teen angst and predictable drama made even more predictable because we're watching re-runs.   Why oh why do we enjoy that show? It's certainly not the captivating story lines that draw us in.   The first&nbsp;reason that pops into my head is "sexy women scantily clad", followed&nbsp;closely in second place&nbsp;by&nbsp;"women in bikinis and mid-drift tops". That sounds more than a bit piggish though. But it  is  the first thing that pops into my head. However it's not  always  piggish to appreciate a well endowed physically fit female specimen, is it? &nbsp;Our thoughts remain pure after all.   We also enjoy making catty comments about the actors. Well not about the actors really, rather the characters they portray. Except in the case of Tori Spelling.&nbsp; In her case, we are sometimes being catty about the actress.&nbsp; She's a "butter face" in our own humble opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we are also extremely disparaging of her character: Ms. Donna Martin, prissy do-gooder virgin extraordinaire. Not that being a prissy do-gooder virgin is a bad thing. But from where we sit, the angst it causes her is mockworthy.&nbsp; Either commit to saving your virginity and be comfortable with your decision or get busy losing it, girl!   Yesterday morning's episode highlighted&nbsp;that dilemma as she wrestled with prom night and her boyfriend David's desire to spend the night with her at the ritzy Bel Age Hotel. We often refer to him as Blue Balls for obvious reasons. Wendy opines that if there is someone desparate enough to have sex with the horsefaced one, she should be grateful enough to follow through.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wendy has a point, albeit a wicked one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Okay you.  Come on out of there.  Yes, you.  The one who has been covertly persuing this site.  You know who you are.

      Yes, Virginia, there  are  such things as tumbleweeds. And one tried to take my life this morning.   It may sound fantastical. Maybe even hard to believe. But in reality, tumbleweeds are an integral part of our landscape. Innocuous most of the time, they collect in the corners and under the furniture and on the stairs and around shoes left out on the floor. Their origins are obvious to those of us in the know. They are not particularly particular about where they choose to rest. Wendy gets busy once or twice a week and sweeps them into great big piles and disposes of them with the dust pan. But sometimes they escape the broom and gracefully float away until they settle in a different resting place. Such is the nature of tumbleweeds, after all.   So back to the attempt on my life. This morning as I descended the stairs, before any caffeine ingestion, still groggy and not quite awake, I was viciously attacked by a rogue tumbleweed! It came out of nowhere doing a realistic imitation of a mutant spider or some other large creepy insectlike creature from the depths of all that is evil. It was lifelike enough that my survival instincts immediately took over and I leapt into the air. As I soared over it, graceful as a gazelle, my eyes scanned frantically to ensure I did not land anywhere near the horrible freak of nature that had somehow found it's way into our abode.  At some point during my flight, I gained enough awareness to realize it wasn't alive at all. It was but a tumbleweed of pet hair daintily wafting on the air currents across the floor during it's journey to a new tumbleweed resting place.   But in that brief moment before my brain caught up with my perception, my life  was  in danger.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I&nbsp;survived to tell the tale.&nbsp; Hooray for me!

      I spent the day yesterday downtown with Richard and Nick.&nbsp; It was a good day.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I've&nbsp;worked with them for seventeen years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard and Nick are structural engineers.&nbsp; I first&nbsp;met&nbsp;Richard while employed at the architectural firm where&nbsp;I began working&nbsp;about a year and a half after The Boy was born.&nbsp; (That was a&nbsp; fabulous  job and deserves more than a passing mention but I'm not writing about that just now.)  &nbsp;  An architectural firm often&nbsp;uses other disciplines such as structural, mechanical and/or civil engineers as part of the project team.&nbsp; Most architects have their preferred engineers with whom&nbsp;to work.&nbsp; Richard and Nick's firm worked on many jobs with us.&nbsp; Usually it was Richard, because he had attended college with one of the principals of the architectural firm and they were pals.   When the firm where I worked went out of business (another interesting life experience but also not the topic of this story), I&nbsp;went into business for myself as a bookkeeper.&nbsp; There's more to that story&nbsp;also but again, it's not part of this tale (gee that line is getting old).&nbsp; Richard and Nick's structural engineering firm&nbsp;was one of my first clients.&nbsp; Because the timing was right.&nbsp; And because I was very lucky.  &nbsp;  They are an odd couple indeed.&nbsp; Richard is originally from Haiti and Nick is British.&nbsp; I don't know how they became friends, but they  are  friends in addition to being long-time business partners.&nbsp; I listen to them banter about soccer matches and current events and their squash game.&nbsp; They like each other.&nbsp; Their firm has always been small, but they seem to&nbsp;prefer it that way.&nbsp; I know I do.&nbsp; I adore&nbsp;working for small business.&nbsp; I've met Richard's wife on many occasions as she comes into the office now and again, but I've&nbsp;never met Nick's although I've spoken with her on the phone.&nbsp; Richard's wife is also Haitian and Nick's is American.&nbsp; Neither couple has children, but they both have dogs.&nbsp; They also both live&nbsp;and work in the District.&nbsp; I've never understood how anyone could live in the District because it's such a screwy place (uh Marion Barry, anyone?) but to each their own.  &nbsp;  So America strikes again.&nbsp; It's a beautiful thing.&nbsp; How did a Haitian and a Brit hook up and start a business?&nbsp; And why don't I know more of their origins?&nbsp; I don't even know what brought them to America or how long ago they came.&nbsp; Maybe those are the types of questions I'll start asking after I've known them for  20  years.&nbsp; Don't want to rush into anything, after all.&nbsp; They know pretty much as much about me as I know about them.&nbsp; The basic outline of my life with some shading in places as conversations occur and details are revealed.&nbsp; Like they know I'm gay and that I have a son and he's in college and where he goes to college and what he's studying and that my sister is a Buddhist nun and that I live with&nbsp;a woman&nbsp;named Wendy and that we&nbsp;love dogs and miss The Boy.&nbsp; And that I'm a basically a happy individual.&nbsp; I know they know that last part because Richard often comments how wonderful it is to see me because I've always got a smile on my face.  &nbsp;  I know they are both Democrats as politics often come up in discussion.&nbsp; I've seen pictures of Nick's esophageal ulcer and the incision from his dog's recent surgery to repair a torn achilles tendon and his wife in curlers holding what looks like a beach ball but is actually a humongous lemon.&nbsp; I know they both are&nbsp;quite into family as they often talk of&nbsp;their families.&nbsp; Richard&nbsp;has his mother living with him and she's not in the best of health.&nbsp; Nick's mother and sister and her husband and children still&nbsp;reside in jolly old England and he travels&nbsp;there periodically to visit. Richard's&nbsp;bulletin board is&nbsp;covered with photos&nbsp;of his nieces and nephews (he's got a ton of them!) and other family members interspersed with some childish drawings. One that sticks in my head is a picture of a Gameboy drawn in crayon with the notation: "Thank you, Uncle Richard! Love, (unintelligible)". That drawing has been hanging in on his bulletin board for a very long time.   Over the years I've seen employees come and go from their firm.&nbsp; Either by leaving for another job or necessary layoffs (the&nbsp;industry is decidedly cyclical) or as happened this year, suicide.   Yeah. Yikes.   In February, I walked into their&nbsp;office&nbsp;building at 14th &amp;&nbsp;K Streets, NW.&nbsp; Our Nation's Capital.&nbsp; McPherson Square&nbsp;Metro stop.&nbsp; Orange or blue line depending&nbsp;on which train comes along first.&nbsp; Then a short walk that seems really long if it is raining.&nbsp; The first thing Nick said before I could even say&nbsp;good morning was "Jim is no longer with us."&nbsp; He had a very odd look on his face.&nbsp; Like he was queasy.&nbsp; I decided to let him continue speaking rather than blurting out the obvious question:&nbsp; "WTF?"   Nick, as is his manner, speaks in a roundabout way but eventually gets to the point after back-tracking and side-tracking and front-tracking several times.&nbsp; All in his cute little British accent.&nbsp; Which usually makes for some interesting conversations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not his accent but his all-over-the-place-edness.&nbsp; This time I really just wanted to&nbsp;know what had happened.&nbsp; Yet interruptions would have slowed it all down.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;let him talk without showing a trace of impatience.&nbsp; My sister would have been proud of me.&nbsp; As I am just not capable of recounting it the way he actually told it, I'll&nbsp;tell it my way herein with a bit of backstory too. &nbsp; Jim had been working there for about three years.&nbsp; Early 30's, single, into fishing, shaved head, about 70 pounds overweight, seriously white boy.&nbsp; No visible tattoos.&nbsp; (If I had to bet, I'd put my money on him being a pothead.&nbsp; Which is not necessarily a bad thing.)&nbsp; He had one of those posters of the deck of cards with the faces of the "America's Most Wanted" hanging in his cubicle.&nbsp; The Iraqi edition.&nbsp; When one was captured or killed, he put a circle with a line through it over the card.&nbsp; Black for dead, red for captured.&nbsp; Evidently he was a competent CADD operator as well as good at taking care of their computer systems.&nbsp; He seemed nice enough to me, just a bit odd as people tend to be.&nbsp; His timecards were always legible.&nbsp; What more could I ask for?&nbsp;   I was&nbsp;there on a Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim had called in the Friday prior, saying he had to be in court or something which was weird in itself.&nbsp; The fellows were a bit befuddled.&nbsp; Then Monday was a holiday.&nbsp; And Tuesday he was a no-show.&nbsp; Nick tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with him.&nbsp; They were worried.&nbsp; It was unlike Jim to just not show up for work.&nbsp;   When he didn't show up again on Wednesday and didn't call or answer his home phone, Nick was&nbsp;disturbed enough to go a bit further to&nbsp;try and locate&nbsp;him.&nbsp; He called the local court in the county where Jim resided, since that's where Jim had&nbsp;implied he'd be on Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps&nbsp;he was doing jury duty or something.&nbsp; What&nbsp;Nick found out was quite far from that.&nbsp;   Long-Nick-story-short, Jim  had  been expected at court the prior Friday.&nbsp; But it wasn't for jury duty.&nbsp; It was for sentencing after his stalking conviction.&nbsp; Jim didn't show up for his court appearance that day so&nbsp;a warrant&nbsp;had been issued for his arrest.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had subsequently been found in his apartment, dead.&nbsp; Suicide by hanging.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Then the WTFs began in earnest.&nbsp; Richard and Nick had worked with this man day in and day out for&nbsp;three years.&nbsp; Yet&nbsp;obviously the personal information he had shared with them was but a tiny piece of what really went on with him outside of the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no hint of legal trouble.&nbsp; Or obsessive behavior.&nbsp; Turns out his conviction for stalking&nbsp;was due to his&nbsp;actions toward a woman who lived in the same apartment complex as him.&nbsp; Or she used to live in the same apartment complex but had relocated to&nbsp;get away from him.&nbsp; And he tracked her down to&nbsp;her new location.&nbsp; Because that's what stalkers do, I guess.&nbsp; While we don't know the details, he evidently caused her enough distress&nbsp;that she had him arrested and followed through with prosecution.&nbsp; And he was convicted.&nbsp; He was going to go to jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead he killed himself.   So&nbsp;that 20-year&nbsp;thought on sharing personal information?&nbsp; That needs re-thinking.&nbsp; Richard and Nick were quite shaken by this event.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a smattering of pictures taken in the office at various times of various employees in various work postures pinned up in various places around the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on his cubicle wall,&nbsp;Nick has a rather large photo of Jim on a roof doing a survey looking like Jim as we all remember him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's smiling.&nbsp; I know they wish they'd known more.&nbsp; That Jim had trusted them with more.&nbsp; While they may not have been able to help him, they would have supported him.&nbsp; Because they are good guys who care about people.&nbsp;   I am fortunate to know them.

      I'll never forget my unbridled joy when I discovered the existence of underwire bras. I had always just skipped right by them in the lingerie department because I was unaware of their super-amazing-unlike-any-bra-I've-ever-worn&nbsp;properties. But then one day as I was perusing the selection in the JC Penney, I got a wild hair and boldly decided to try something new. What a find! A bra&nbsp;that offers real&nbsp;assistance&nbsp;to&nbsp;my... as there is just no nice way to say this&nbsp;I'll attempt a&nbsp;modest and&nbsp;innocuous wording that will hopefully not bring any particular image to one's mind&nbsp;especially not one close to my reality unless you have a&nbsp;pair of your own&nbsp;and can honestly commiserate... my no-longer-twenty-one-year-old&nbsp;breasts in regaining their lost perkiness! Well not actually regaining, but at least giving the illusion (albeit temporary as is the nature of most illusions) of&nbsp;lift and shape. I enthusiastically embraced this newfound wonder and replaced every brassiere in my drawer with those of the underwire variety.   But now I can't decide if these things are a blessing or a curse.   You see, as the brassieres&nbsp;near the end of their useful life those helpful wondiferous wires begin to work their way free of the cloth in which they are encased. It begins innocently enough, just a loose string or a bit of worn fabric. Insidiously the wires begin to squirm and move until they have created a true hole out of which to poke their sharp pointy little ends. And that's where the fun really begins.&nbsp;   So I am reminded yet again there is a price for everything.&nbsp; Yet some prices are worth paying.&nbsp; Double even.

      Boneless skinless chicken thighs grilled on the barbeque, seasoned with just salt and pepper. &nbsp; Asparagus, steamed.&nbsp; Thin tender stalks with a little crunch and amazing flavor. &nbsp; White corn on the cob.&nbsp;&nbsp;Boiled just the right amount of time, not a minute to long.&nbsp; Slathered with margarine and sprinkled generously&nbsp;with salt. &nbsp; Followed by dental floss. &nbsp; Dinner couldn't have been any better. &nbsp;

      I just picked up Detail's ashes from the vet, so he's back home albeit in a completely different form.&nbsp; Actually I'm never sure he really left as I think I've felt his spirit from time to time.&nbsp; I'm shaking off my black and white view of life.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For now&nbsp;he's&nbsp;in a very pretty wooden container on the mantle.&nbsp; He came home with a little certificate also.&nbsp; There's a bit of a poem printed on it along with his name and ours.&nbsp;     "Farewell, Master, yet not farewell.  Where I go, ye too shall dwell.  I am gone, before your face,  A moment's time, a little space.  When ye come where I have stepped  Ye will wonder why ye wept."     &nbsp;  --  After Death  by Edwin Arnold

       "So.  So you think you can tell  Heaven from hell?  Blue skies from pain?  Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?  A smile from a veil?  Do you think you can tell?   Did they get you trade  Your heros for ghosts?  Hot ashes for trees?  Hot air for the cool breeze?  Cold comfort for change?  Did you exchange  A walk-on part in the war  for a lead role in a cage?   How I wish.  How I wish you were here.  We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl  Year after year.  Running over the same old ground  And have we found  The same old fears?  Wish you were here."    It's a missingness song, yes? An "I miss you and hope life is treating you gently and hope you are not having to compromise your soul to continue living it" song.&nbsp; At least that's my interpretation of it.  &nbsp;  The first time I remember  really  hearing this song was quite a few years ago.&nbsp; Back before I was even 20 years old.&nbsp; Years before&nbsp;The Boy came along.&nbsp; I was hanging out with friends in our living room.&nbsp; Dean was there.&nbsp; Who's Dean, you may wonder.&nbsp; Dean was to BG's family as&nbsp;James&nbsp;would later&nbsp;be to ours.&nbsp; That clears it up, doesn't it?&nbsp; He was also the best man at&nbsp;my wedding, oh so way back when life was oh so&nbsp;different and we were oh so&nbsp;different and&nbsp;oh so young yet&nbsp;thinking we were oh so grown up when we now know we really were so so far from grown up.&nbsp; When you are not yet 20, life seems so simple.&nbsp; At least it did to me.   So Dean put the Pink Floyd album on the record player (yes.. record player... as this was before cassette tapes were prevalent and way before CDs).&nbsp; He&nbsp; was laying back on the floor on that summer afternoon singing along.&nbsp; I was lazily stretched out on the couch just listening.  &nbsp;  I wasn't consciously missing anyone or anything back then.&nbsp;&nbsp;I either hadn't been around long enough or was just not aware&nbsp;enough of things to&nbsp;really know what missingness was about.&nbsp;   And now&nbsp;as&nbsp;I sit here&nbsp;more than 20 years later and more&nbsp;than twice as old as I was back then on that day, I can't help but&nbsp;wonder since I&nbsp;have changed this much in the past 20 years what the&nbsp;heck will I be like in another 20 years?&nbsp; And while I&nbsp;didn't recognize anything missing back then, I certainly do now.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I wonder what's going to be on my&nbsp;missingness list when I'm 60?

      One drawback of living in the suburbs:  those damned school buses that seem to be everywhere at once when I need to get going to where ever it is I may be headed.  But of late I have been enjoying school being out for the summer!  Not getting caught behind a train of school buses when I'm rushing to get to work is nice.  And I'm usually rushing because mornings are just not my friend.  All good things must come to an end, of course.  I'd forgotten about summer school.  While there are fewer buses on the road than for regular school, they are back.

      I've just confirmed something I've suspected for a while now.  One of those silly little things that flashes through my mind as it does just about every evening but that I've never bothered following up to figure it out.  But last night I did!  Well I'm actually not sure what exactly it is that I've confirmed but I feel that some sort of question now has an answer.  Anyhoo.  It's about the cat this time.  Figero (yeah some folks may spell it Figaro but we like it our way).  His food dish is kept on the counter or else the dogs would chow on his chow and he'd be irritated.  And most likely cranky.  And the dogs would most likely be scratched and cowering on the other side of the room.  Fig has one of those divided dishes with two compartments.  It's green.  One side is reserved for wet food and the other for dry.  Each morning he gets a generic little can of wet food for breakfast.  In the evening when the dogs are served their dinner, Figero usually just perches up on his food counter and watches.  It's not until later in the evening when I'm down there setting up the coffee pot to brew for the morning when he chats me up for some crunchies.  This is where my wondering took root.  He always eats the wet food in one sitting.  Or he'll take a short break and come back in like 30 minutes to finish it off.  He's predictable that way.  But the dry food is different.  He never finishes a compartment-full in one sitting.  In the evening when he meows and makes other charming yet insistent cat-asking noises, I look over to see how much dry food is still in the dry food compartment of his dish.  Sometimes it's empty.  So I reach into the cupboard above his head and retrieve the bag of dry food.  Then I shake an appropriate amount into the appropriate compartment.  He pushes his way past me and crunches until he's crunched enough.  Meanwhile I put the bag back in the cupboard and go about my business.  But sometimes when I look over to see how much dry food is still in the dry food compartment of his dish there clearly is plenty of dry food there for him to snack on.  Yet he is still meowing and pacing on his food counter asking for something.  I've tried picking up the dish and shaking it so he can hear that the delicious crunchies are awaiting consumption.  Or I'll run my fingers through it for the same effect.  He'll sniff around the dish after I do that, but will look up at me saying, "You know what I want, you silly woman.  Now make it happen!"  So being a compliant pet parent, I always take out the bag of food and put a bit more in the dish.  Then he settles in to snack.  But last night when I saw there was still plenty of dry food in the appropriate side of his dish and after I had tried my worthless tricks to help him realize that fact, I did something different.  I took the bag of food and just  pretended  to shake more into the dish.  Not one piece of new food did I add.  And guess what?  He settled right in to snack.  So what does this mean?  I have no clue.  None.  Zero.  Zip.  Nada.  Except that I know I can fake out the cat.  And that sometimes faking out is exactly what he may be asking for.  Good kitty.  He's more like the rest of us than I realized.

       urlLink Talking tombstones . And you'd not&nbsp;have to listen to any back talk. Or be interrupted. Or if you were interrupted, you'd not even be aware.&nbsp; And it would be nice to keep talking even after&nbsp;having&nbsp;jumped the ravine.&nbsp; Not that I'm sure I'd have anything to say.&nbsp; But I bet I could think of something.

      And confetti of course will always speak to me of  urlLink Popeyes Chicken Strips !  We were in the drive-through at Popeyes again a weekend or so ago.  On the way home from yet another trip to Home Depot.   And I again ordered a spicy chicken strip meal.  Because that's what I do at Popeyes.  We pulled up to the window and the clerk asked me what type of sauce I'd like with my strips.  For some unknown reason on impulse completely defying rational explanation, I asked her for some confetti sauce.  She looked at me in askance, not understanding what I was requesting.  But remember, their sweet and sour sauce is officially labeled "confetti" sauce.  It's printed in relatively large letters on the lid of the container just over the smaller letters that say "sweet and sour".  Since she worked there, I thought for sure she'd know what I meant.  So I smiled and clarified, "sweet and sour sauce please".  "Oh!" she said and grabbed a few containers of the delectable sauce.  I said conversationally "Confetti is the official Popeyes name for sweet and sour, doncha know.  That's why I asked for it like that."  She squinted at the top of one of the little containers she held in her hand and said with a smile "Well sure enough!  I had never noticed that before!"  So what's my point?  I don't have one.  This is nothing new.

      So what's the difference between "unknown caller" and "private caller"?  Not that it really matters because I won't answer up the phone for either one.  Well sometimes I will but I have to be in just the right mood and I usually end up regretting it.  But I'd still like to know what causes one number to be "unknown" and another to be "private".  I just had the Tina Turner song "Private Dancer" start playing in my head.  My sister always used to love that song.

      So Tejada had a great night in the  urlLink Home Run Derby  last evening.  Now if he'd just start hitting those blasts a bit more often in games that count.  Yeah I'm kinda pissed at those Orioles.  I had my hopes so high (like  that's  their fault?).  But hey, maybe they'll pick it up in the second half of the season.  I am an eternal optimist after all.

      The Boy, since his freshman year of high school, had always been rather preppy.  At least in the way he dressed and groomed himself.  He wore a lot of khakis and button down shirts.  In fact, he didn't own any blue jeans at all.  Still doesn't.  Hardly ever wore sneakers, eschewing them for his  urlLink Tims  or other lace-up shoes.  He also spent an inordinate amount of time "grooming".  While I used to get irritated when we had to wait for him to finish "doing his hair", I did appreciate the care he gave his appearance versus the other directions he could have chosen.  When the term "metrosexual" came into vogue a while back, we realized he fit it to a tee.   urlLink Dictionary.com  defines it  urlLink this way .  Ayup, that's The Boy.  His friends used to come home with him after school and he'd make them omelettes.  Every so often they even cleaned up the kitchen afterwards.  Every so often like once in a blue moon.  Ah the good old days?  The Boy had a friend named Jason in high school.  Jason is gay.  The Boy is quite comfortable around gay people because... well... he grew up with us.  They used to go clothes shopping together, among other things.  One year Jason accompanied our family on our biennial beach "reunion" trip.  Those trips are great.  Mingling with family members we only see every so often and observing how they've changed (or haven't changed) is enjoyable.  Plus at the beach, if they start getting on my nerves (like family is so good at doing either intentionally or inadvertantly), I can just take a walk or a nap or bury my nose in a book or do whatever to escape.  Jason and The Boy had a pretty tight friendship.  The beach was a good place to practice their social skills, flirting in particular.  Not with each other, but with others.  If you've ever seen how teenagers are at the beach, you know what I mean.  They developed a strategy that evidently worked quite well.  When Jason was too shy to approach guys he wanted to talk to, The Boy started the conversations.  And vice-versa with the girls.  Those two had a great time that week.  The Boy met a girl from our locale whom he actually ended up dating for a few months after that trip.  Okay where was I going with this?  Oh yeah.  During his first year of college, he kept up his metrosexual image.  But when he landed his current summer job, one of the requirements was to grow out his  urlLink hair and beard .  And when we visited last week, he greeted us wearing a thrift store t-shirt and some cheap sneakers he had picked up at Walmart.  (Not that he didn't look good, because he did.  A sight for sore eyes indeed.  He just looked so different.)  Now granted, actors often have to adapt their looks to the part they are playing.  So the shaggy hair I understand.  But those clothes!  Has our metrosexual transformed permanently into a hippie?  Or is this just a summer phase?  Or is he just trying out a completely different image?  Metrosexual or hippie or anything in-between, matters not to us.  Another of the joys of parenthood:  watching them evolve.  Change, as this year has proven to me in so many ways, is inevitable.

      To preserve the ever-so-delicate state of my sanity, I'm trying to ignore politics this week.  It's a difficult endeavor what with the whole  urlLink debate going on in the Senate  regarding the proposed Constitutional amendment.  But when I read this post over at  urlLink Obsidian Wings , the following excerpts really hit on why I just don't understand how anyone can feel the need for our Constitution to be amended to define marriage.  Edward_ wrote (in part):     "Gay people want equal treatment under the law. This shocks some people. How dare they? But to understand how simple and primal this is, all they need to do is imagine the reverse. You, as straight, are the minority, and the gay majority wants you to accept second-class citizenship. You'd be throwing up barricades and bombing police headquarters within a week. Give your gay fellow citizens a break. They really just want to buy a house, start a family, and retire with a nest egg that allows them to travel a bit and complete their collection of fine china replicas of Judy Garland and Shirley Temple. Your fear is unfounded. If you were as busy as you wish you were having straight sex, by the way, you'd have precious little time to give any thought at all to what your gay neighbors were doing. Sort that out before you pass an amendment chiseling discrimination into our most precious document."    And some of the comments fleshed this out a bit more:  Fabius commented (in part):    "My current defense of gays against the militant anti-gay (who happen to belong to all races and political persuasions) is to begin by insisting that I don't want special rights for gays - I just expect that they have the same rights as the rest of us."    And Brian added (in part):     "As to the specifics of gay marriage and rights, I would make the following points:  Why should it matter that gays want to make 'married' commitments to one another?  Why should they be prevented from doing so in the US while all other adults, equivalent in all other ways, are allowed to do so?  What has done more to weaken the institution of marriage and social cohesion? Is it gays wanting to make a commitment to each other or heterosexual infidelity, divorce, single-parent families? Or is it the alcoholism, drugs, domestic violence, arguments about money that take place within marriages that destroy love and the cohesion of society?  Some argue that marriage is about children. ...  But marriage is not always about children and permitting gay 'marriage' does not alter that.  For those that argue that marriage is a religious act, here Mr Bush and I agree, you are still able to ask whether it is the duty of the state to impose a religious choice. I don't think it is."      While none of the above perfectly represents my own feelings on the subject, a number of the larger points are touched on.  Religion and politics are separate.  That is a basic tenet of American civil liberties.  Or it's supposed to be.  But is the big stink over just the word 'marriage'?  Or is it over same gender unions of any type?  Our Constitution is not a dictionary after all.  So why write the definition of marriage into it?  And let's not forget how some heterosexuals treat marriage and commitment and family as far, far less than sacred.  But is anyone proposing to strip from those folks their right to get married and divorced and married and divorced as many times as they may choose?  Nope.  Because  that  type of behavior doesn't harm the 'sanctity of marriage' or undermine the 'family structure'.  Sanctimonious bastards.  Babbling I may be.  This topic does that to me.

      Wendy performed a huge service for us yesterday.  I mean huge on the scale of Mount Rushmore huge.  It's that organizational thing, don't ya know?  Wendy is my Mount Rushmore of organization.  We both function so much better when things around us are organized and neat.  But sometimes over time things that started out organized and neat get mucked up and messed up and disarranged and screwy.  This time it was our dresser drawers.  And our closets.  The ones we keep our clothes in, not the closets where we keep all those other things that need to be kept tucked away behind closed doors.  I actually have a dresser drawer now that is completely empty!  How cool is that?  And all my clothes are already neatly stowed in other places!  That drawer is  really  empty.  Like time to go shopping empty.  Mega cool.  Like cold Mountain Dew on a hot summer day cool.  Or like I imagine cold Mountain Dew on a hot summer day cool would be if I chose to drink such things but I typically don't.  But the best thing is when I open the other drawers.  Everything has a place and is in it.  And the closet!  Whee!  Leftover winter clothes hanging out in our every day closet that had not yet made it to the winter clothes closet made their way over there yesterday, kind of like a snake fish moving from one pond to another.  It's a beautiful thing indeed. Envy me.  I know you do.  At least for my dresser drawers.

      I drink alcohol.  I'm of age.  Plenty past the minimum age to purchase and imbibe restricted beverages of whatever sort I may desire.  It's been a long long long while since anyone selling such age-limited beverages has ever asked for proof of my age.  I've gotten used to this.  I think.  But part of me misses being carded every now and again.  Usually I do the grocery shopping.  It's one of my household chores.  And I enjoy it.  But sometimes we go together, Wendy and I.  Like the day I'm going to tell you about.  We picked up a twelve-pack of beer for our refrigerator.  Well not actually  for  our refrigerator because our refrigerator runs on a different type of juice.  It was for us.  Truth be told, we picked up  two  twelve-packs of beer because she likes one type and I like another.  We both like cheap beer however.  Because we are of a frugal nature perhaps.  Or maybe we just don't have good taste.  Or maybe cheap beer tastes good to us.  Which it does.  So we had two twelve-packs of cheap beer mingled in with our zucchini, fudgesicles, and pork chops.  And cat food.  And assorted other things we keep around the house to assuage our hunger pains or cravings as needed.  Wendy was up by the cashier and I was in the back behind the cart unloading our goods onto the conveyor belt.  The cashier was about to ring up the beer when she looked at Wendy and said "May I see your ID please?"  A quick aside here is a necessary part of this story.  About a week prior, Wendy's driver's license along with her bank card and a small amount of cash were stolen from her car.  She had inadvertantly left them on the seat of her car after picking up lunch.  Some prick had smashed her car window right there in the parking lot of her office and helped themselves.  People suck that way sometimes.  Okay back to the grocery store line.  Because Wendy had not yet received her replacement ID, she looked at me and asked "Do you have your ID with you?"  The cashier also glanced over at me.  And then she said "Oh!  Is she with you?  Well I don't need to see  her  ID!" as she proceeded to ring up the beer.  Now because I'm an easy going sort and often see humor where others may not, I burst out laughing.  Borderline hysterical laughter, but more amused.  The cashier looked up at me and actually had the grace to blush.  Because she realized what she had done.  Not implied.  Stated.  Unequivocally.  I look old.  Plenty old.  We all then shared a laugh together because it  was  funny.  On this past trip to NC, we stopped at the Red Apple gas station to pick up some beer.  They didn't have our cheap beer of choice, so we settled for Miller Lite.  I got in line behind two men, also purchasing beer.  The lady behind the counter (oddly not Russian as we'd come to expect during our short visit but rather an older local lady) dutifully asked each in turn for his ID.  So when it was my turn to check out, I said with a smile "Aren't you going to ask for my ID?"  She laughed while covering her mouth with one hand (but not before I noticed she only had one tooth in the front on top!).  Evidently the thought of asking  me  for my ID was the most humorous idea she'd heard all day.  Plenty old.  And I look it.  Argh.  Might as well laugh.

      Stop what you are doing! Remove your hand from the mouse. Hold it upright and turn your hand so you can see your palm.  Below your pinkie finger where your hand ends and your wrist is about to begin is the triquetrum bone.  Yeah, that's the one.  Mine's bright red.  With the beginnings of a callous.  Or maybe it already  is  a callous but I'm in denial.  My non-mouse hand doesn't have one.  It's triquetrum bone is a smooth integral part of the rest of my hand.  As much as I love caressing my mouse with it's wonderfully versatile wheel and smooth slick mousing motion, I really don't like this bright red callousy-feeling spot developing on my triquetrum bone.  I'm rather ashamed to admit I actually felt better when I noticed Wendy has the same spot on her triquetrum bone.  Is it just us?  Maybe only lesbians in Virginia sport such a vibrant red spot on their mouse-abused triquetrums.  Could it be so?  And triquetrum is fun to say. Try it!  You must!

      In Manteo, North Carolina of all places.  Who knew?  Well others were aware, just not Wendy and me.  We typically frequent the Outer Banks in the off-season and had not before experienced this phenomenon.  Evidently the dwindling supply of young Americans willing to spend their summers in the Outer Banks working jobs ranging from hotel clerk to stockers at the Food Lion created the need to import labor from Russia.  Of this I need to know more.  It's not an urgent need, but again it's the curiosity factor niggling at my brain.

      Mission accomplished!   Grocery shopping:  $95.54   Toiletry shopping:  $45.51 (but that included a belt and new sheets!)   New Friends:  Interesting, eclectic, kind, chatty (hot chicks few and far between however!)   Apartment:  Godawful, but what can one expect with five guys living there?  They were trying, however.  The living areas and kitchen were pretty clean!   Tan:  Not too much, not too little.  Golden Boy he is.   Performance:  Enjoyed it.  Lovely setting and we were treated to a gorgeous sunset.  8 costume changes for The Boy.  Beautiful music.  Interesting show.   Feedings:  Dinner, lunch, dinner.  Good good and good.   Hugs:  Plentiful.

      The story of how Wendy and I met is an interesting one.  Maybe only interesting to us, but then most of what I'm writing about here is only interesting to me despite that other people are evidently finding it to be of some small interest to themselves.  (Which fascinates me, but in a good way.)  I like our story not only because of the impact meeting her has had on my life, but also because now that I know her more intimately I know what a stretch it was for her to reach out in the way she did.  I've come to realize just how reserved she can be with others, but with me she is quite bold.  That made an impression on me then because it was usually me being bold in relationships.  Turns out I like it the other way around too.  Who knew?  We now take turns being bold, depending on who has the strength to do so at the moment boldness is required.  So I'm going to document the  Tale of Wendy & Suzanne  herein.  And I get to tell this from my perspective since it is my story.  I may ask Wendy to tell the same tale from her perspective.  It could be quite amusing to then compare the versions.  Well amusing to us anyway.  It's far too long to recount in one post and I know I can't sit still long enough to type it all at once, so I'm going to break it up.  Soap opera style, except without the fake drama.  I'll not pepper it with the gratuitous sex scenes often found on daytime TV, preferring to savor those intimate memories privately.  I'm sure you'll be able to handle the disappointment.  Enough of the intro.... on to Part 1!   **fade back in time**  I was single.  And it was good.  The Boy and I had recently relocated back to Mount Vernon, the first real move where he had to help pack and lift and carry and haul.  The last time we had moved, I was still packing and lifting and carrying and hauling  him  as he wasn't nearly grown enough to do so himself.  He would be starting 8th grade in the fall, his first year in public school.  Now if you don't know any kids of that age, you need to know that is the age when socializing with one's friends begins to take complete precedence over one's family (it's one of the reasons we moved, but that's a different chapter).  While I still spent quite a bit of time enjoying The Boy entertaining his friends at our house, I also spent a great deal of time ferrying him hither and yon to meet the demands of his vigorous social calendar.  (Really.  I'm not getting off topic.  Setting the background is all.)  So I was single.  And The Boy didn't need his old mom for companionship much anymore. *sigh*  I decided perhaps I would again dip my toes into the dating scene.  As there were not too many single lesbians (or for that matter ANY lesbians) hanging around the suburban mother crowd I'd been part of for years, I began considering my options.  I had never really dated in the traditional sense of dating.  Who had time for that?  I didn't fall into the stereotypical lesbian-second-date-moving-van category either.  I had The Boy to consider and he came first.  I was not about to have a string of women flowing in and out of my bedroom and our lives.  To me, offering a child stability at home is almost as vital as salt is to Wendy.  So I was cautious.  And would take my time introducing my son to anyone I may happen to date.  That would be a privilege those prospective women would have to earn.  I had identified several very important qualities that would have to be part of any woman I would ever date more than once.  In no particular order, she would have to:   be able to write intelligently, using complete sentences in actual paragraphs.  Vocabulary and proper spelling would be essential.  have a good relationship with her family, particularly her mother and father.  like books.  And enjoy laying around reading them.  And be able to intelligently discuss their contents.  enjoy sex (gratuitous or otherwise!).  be a sports fan.  Football and baseball specifically.  It would be a plus if she were a Redskins fan.  Ice hockey and basketball would kinda be minuses.  love pets and all the headache and joy that come with having them.  love kids and all the headache and joy that come with having them.  appreciate suburban life.  have a sense of humor.  Preferably a sharp one.  like herself.  I was not too picky.  Just selective.  And that was just fine.  I know what I like and what I need---or maybe I should say I know what I DON'T need, which can truly be just as relevant.    See I used to be the "rescuer" sort, where I'd try to fill in the gaps for people who weren't quite complete.  Got a problem?  Oh no problem at all!  Let me fix it for you!  I'll surround you with my love and affection and show you just how wonderful life can be!  Yeesh.  While my heart may have been in the right place, that approach pretty much guaranteed relationship failure.  So no more rescuing for me.  This time around, it would be on an equal ground or I'd just stay single.  I don't mean to sound pompous, but I had come to realize I was a pretty hot commodity in the lesbian market:  a stable and sane individual.  Actually, that made me a hot commodity in any dating market, not just that of the lesbian variety but I was not interested in just any old dating market.  Internet dating was just gaining a foothold in modern romance.  That approach appealed to me greatly for a number of reasons.  Email correspondence would be a useful screening tool.  I would be able to discern her writing ability (and all things that go with such ability) merely by reading an email.  And I could do it on my own time, when my schedule permitted.  I created a screenname exclusively for this adventure:  UpUpUpUp, intended to convey my upbeat and positive nature.  I penned and posted my first personal ad, sappily describing what I was looking for in a wife.  Yeah I know.  Blech.  But hey, I was new at this.  And I included a favorite quote from a Tori Amos song:   "In a sense, he said, you're alone here.  So if you jump, you best jump far."   (This quote actually became key in the process, although I did not know it would then.)  And the deluge of emails began.  My inbox starting filling up so rapidly it was almost alarming.  There was just not time to correspond with everyone who replied to my ad, but I always gave at least a minimal reply even to those who clearly did not possess even one quality from my list.  That's when I formulated some other loose requirements, adding geographic and age factors to my screening process.  With those that passed the initial screening, I made dates for coffee.  In the next few months, I drank quite a bit of coffee with strangers.  And met some interesting women of all different shapes, personalities and life circumstance.  But I hadn't met Ms. Forever....  So I posted a new ad under a different screenname, Words Rock, using a different approach:  humor.  But I tagged my signature with the same Tori Amos quote.  Again the email deluge began.  Some of the  same  respondents replied to my new ad with the  exact same reply  they had used for my first ad!  Incredible creativity.  Not!  But one repeat respondent made me literally throw my head back and laugh out loud.  It was a one-liner that read simply "Up, is that you?"  Wow.  In-ter-esting.  Pleasing even.  Keep in mind the two separate ads were posted under different screennames months apart written in completely different styles from one another.  Really.  They were like Night and Day.  Jeckle and Hyde.  Sun and Moon.  Yin and Yang even.  Sap and Humor.  I think you get it.  I had started a file of responses to my first ad.  This reply had me pawing through papers to find this woman's first email.  As I re-read it, I was reminded why I had not really followed up on it.  She lived in Rockville, about an hour away over heavily trafficked freeways.  And she was only 28 (I was 35 at the time) which seemed to me an awfully large age gap.  But now I was intrigued.  She was obviously brighter than most, having made the connection based on my use of the same quote.  Good attention to detail.  Her first email was cohesively written, concise yet informative, good sentence structure and grammar.  She had appealed to me the first time based on those characteristics, but the age and geography warned me away.  Now I had no choice.  I was compelled to write back.  Curiosity does that to me.  We began corresponding and chatting online frequently.  And so I made the acquaintance of Wendy.  The adventure had begun.   .... to be continued

      We sleep in a king-size bed.  All of us.  At the same time.  We fill the king-size bed to capacity.  Wendy has her side and I have mine and we are free to share each other's spaces as the mood suits.  If it were just the two of us, there would almost be too much space (as if it were even possible to have too much space in bed!).  But as I said, it's not just the two of us.  Cosine pretty much keeps to the foot of the bed, either the right or left side or even the middle, depending on her mood.  But always at the foot.  Figero also prefers the foot, typically reclining on the left end corner.  Detail, when we used to bring him up to join us, never stayed long.  Near the end, he occupied the middle because we didn't want him to fall out.  But he usually only stayed for a little while before moving himself back to the landing.  Dudley is the one who thinks the bed belongs exclusively to him and we are just there to keep him company.  He doesn't seem to care where on the bed he sleeps, just as long as it's in the bed.  He does not, however, typically choose the foot of the bed.  It drives Wendy crazy when we all pile in and Dudley chooses to snuggle between my legs instead of over by her.  It drives me crazy too but for a different reason.  I dislike being pinned in for any length of time.  But it is comforting when he nests there and uses my thigh as a shelf for his chin.  Just not for an extended period of time because then the comfort dissipates and I start to twitch.  Which is just not pleasant.  Not pleasant at all.  We were discussing that there really is just not enough room in our bed.  The obvious solution of kicking the animals out of the bed is really no solution at all as far as we are concerned.  Wendy opined that what we need is a kingdom-size bed rather than a mere king-size.  Which begs the question... how large  is  kingdom-size?  As long as it's at least a tad bigger than king, we'd be good to go.

      Long ago in another life phase, The Boy and I lived in Woodbridge, Virginia.  Our neighborhood was the stereotypical definition of blue collar living.  On one side of us lived Traditional Family and on the other side lived Hippy Family.    Traditional Family consisted of a Mom, Dad and 2 daughters.  Well maybe not quite so traditional because Daughter One is from mom's first marriage.  Perhaps I should say they are a traditional blended family.  That'll work.  Dad was a cop and mom worked as an accounting clerk for the local trash service.  Very nice people.  Fanatical about washing their automobiles, however.  Every weekend, rain or shine.  I'm serious.  I've seen them out in the rain soaping up their cars.  To each their own.  They were good neighbors.  Hippy Family was not traditional by any definition.  Mom was a checker at the local Giant Food store.  I'm not sure what Dad did, outside of playing in a rock band.  Mom was about 15 years older than Dad.  They had one devil spawn of a daughter who could only have originated in the center of all that is evil (I saw her puking in the front yard from drinking too much one time too many to be magnanimous.  Puking in the front yard was NOT a common occurrence in the neighborhood except at the Hippy Family house.  And seeing that even once was one time to many, ya know?).  The other daughter was a normal enough little girl (until growing up in her devil spawn sister's shadow turned her into a drug-using redneck slut but we had already moved before that transformation and I only heard that second hand).  I was fairly shy back in those days and did not seek out interface with my neighbors.  It was too daunting.  I was dealing with many life changing events at that time and did not see the need to carry familiarity beyond a wave and hello.  Hippy Dad and his band used to practice in their basement way way way into the wee wee hours of the morning.  This was not good.  Not good at all.  I'd lay awake at night fuming to the bass beat that was so loud they may as well have been playing in my bedroom.  Or sometimes they would arrive home after a gig and unload their equipment.  They were boisterous and loud, which I wouldn't have minded except my bedroom window overlooked their driveway and they never arrived home earlier than 2 am.  I finally decided it was worth risking their neighborly wrath and I began calling the police instead of fuming.  Yes yes, I know.  Perhaps I should have spoken with them first and explained how their inconsideration was interrupting my beauty sleep.  Perhaps I could have reasoned with them and negotiated an equitable compromise.  I took the easy way out.  The police were quite responsive and never took more than 5 minutes to arrive, even for a non-emergency type of complaint such as that.  I'd hear them pull up and begin knocking on Hippy Family's front door.  Like they could hear a knock with all that "music" being played in the basement.  Typically, the cops would then head to the backyard through the side gate and knock on the basement door.  The "music" would halt and be replaced by Hippy Dude's loud voice laughingly reassuring the police they would cease and desist their noise pollution, at least for that evening.  Hippy Family also had a dog they left outside for hours on end.  This poor dog barked incessantly and spoiled many a Sunday afternoon nap for me.  I didn't call the cops on the dog however.  It was daytime after all.  I did the bold thing and knocked on their door, suppressing my irritation and asking politely if they would SHUT THEIR FUCKING DOG UP.  Not in those exact words of course.  They were so clueless.  Once in the summer when I had to go remind them to be responsible dog parents, Hippy Dad was laying on the sofa.  I could see him through the open front door as I approached.  He was like, "Oh, is the dog barking?  I didn't notice."  Yeesh.  I'm not sure either family knew what to think when they realized a lesbian had moved in next door.  And they did notice.  At least Traditional Family did.  More on that later perhaps.

      Wendy and I were watching baseball on television this weekend.  Nothing different this weekend from any other in that regard.  But this weekend there were interesting games between American and National league teams.  These games have an added appeal because whomever is not playing in their home stadium has to adapt their strategy to follow the rules of the other league.  Interesting puzzle for managers, I'm sure.  We started out watching the Cubs/White Sox but when they had a rain delay the network switched us over to the Mets/Yankees.  Excellent!  Even more excellent because the Mets were pounding those hated Yankees.  It was a beautiful thing.  That game was being played in Shea Stadium, home of the Mets.  All stadiums play music during the game, tunes that are blasted out over the loudspeakers and designed to rev up the fans and players alike.  At Shea they have what sounds like an organ.  A real organ like you'd hear in church if you ever went to church.  It was cool to hear some of the classic stadium rally songs blasted out on an organ.  And then the organist plinked out the familiar strains of a song that I have never before heard played in a stadium.  Wendy and I looked at each other in disbelief and laughed.  Is that what we think it is?  It was the opening notes of a song by the Violent Femmes called  "Blister in the Sun" .  It's a very distinctive riff and if you know the song you know what I'm talking about.  In my head I could hear the lyrics:  "When I'm out walking I strut my stuff yeah I'm so strung out I'm high as a kite I just might stop to check you out."    Real baseball rally material, yes?  Well not usually but why not?  As is always the case when I hear that song, I thought of Brenna, an old friend of The Boy.  Often when she was at our house she'd be plunking out tunes on a guitar.  And ever since the day I'd heard her playing and singing  "Blister in the Sun" , she always comes to mind whenever I hear it.  I have no clue as to the meaning of the lyrics and I've given up analysis.  It is a catchy tune, be-boppable and upbeat.  And it must have helped the Mets because they did a real number on those Yankees.  Swept the series.  Nice.  "Let me go on like I blister in the sun let me go on big hands I know you're the one"

       "The hot dog eating contest is not only a beautiful display of athleticism, it is a fundamental way for citizens of all nations to display patriotism," said Wayne Norbitz, president of Nathan's Famous. So says  urlLink this article  about Nathan's Famous 86th annual hot dog eating contest held each fourth of July in Coney Island, New York.  The winner this year, for his fourth consecutive victory, downed 53-1/2 hot dogs in 12 minutes.  That's quite a few hot dogs, isn't it?  Like enough to feed a couple baseball teams.  I personally think true Athletic Patriots would want at least ketchup too, but evidently these Athletic Patriots eat their hot dogs plain.  To me, a hot dog is just not a hot dog without ketchup.  And relish.  And just a touch of mustard.  Maybe a few onions.  And if I'm really really lucky, my mom's homemade coleslaw prepared in true Southern style.  (And now that I think about it, I haven't had my mom's coleslaw in quite a while.  I think a special request may be in order.  She makes  awesome  coleslaw.)  I've only witnessed one eating contest myself and I wish I could have those minutes of my life back to use differently.  It was a blueberry pie eating contest at some local fair way back.  Like way back when I was still a dependent on my parent's tax returns.  Yeah.  A long time ago.  Made a real impression on me.  It was disgusting.  Blueberry pie smeared faces and losing contestants puking under the table.  Some things are just better left undone, if you know what I mean.  I've managed to avoid displays of such esurience since.  I enjoy chewing my food before swallowing.  Taking the time to savor the taste is nice too.  Evidently, however, there are lots of folks who enjoy those cram-as-much-food-in-your-mouth-as-you-can-as-quickly-as-you-can-and-then-somehow-get-it-into-your-stomach contests.  These contests are prevalent enough that there is a organization, the International Federation of Competitive Eating which keeps track of the  urlLink title holders  in these  events of gormandizing.  They also have their own  urlLink circuit  of recurring tournaments.  I find it interesting that the same fellow who won the hot dog eating contest also holds the record for cow brains, having sucked down 17.7 pounds in only 15 minutes!  (How many cows brains are in a pound?  Do I really want to know?)  It appears there is a limited pool of people who are actually good at devouring massive amounts of various food types in record time as there are quite a few repeats on the title holders list.  The food changes but the names remain the same.  One of them is a tiny little woman from my own city:   urlLink Sonya Thomas !  She's quite the little glutton.  Among other records, she is the Federation's reigning champ at hard boiled eggs (65 in 6 minutes 40 seconds...  Cool Hand Luke , anyone?) and cheesecake (11 pounds of Downtown Atlantic cheesecake in eleven minutes!).  All that crazy eating and she still maintains her weight around 100 lbs.  She should bottle her metabolism and sell it.

      A creature of habit I am, not quite to the point of obsession, but I do enjoy my routines.  In the morning, the first thing I do after dragging myself out of bed is to escort our pack outside.  I fling open the french doors to the screened porch and wave my arms like I'm directing traffic.  Which I sort of am.  "Good boy, good girl, good boy" I say as our dogs flow out around me heading for the yard.  Not that they are necessarily proceeding in the order of boy-girl-boy, but I like the symmetry of saying it that way.  While they are outside doing the things that dogs do outside, I feed the cat and mete out the dog food into their three bowls.  The communal water dish is filled with fresh clean water.  As I let them in, I wave my arms directing the flow and say again, "good boy, good girl, good boy" as they re-enter the house and make a beeline to their dishes to break their fast.  But that's about to change.  Tomorrow when I let them out, I already know how I'm going to feel because I've imagined it many times over the past few weeks (even months maybe).  The lack of symmetry will mock me.    Good boy, good girl.... goodbye....   Detail August 5, 1988-July 3, 2004

      Because it is the second of the month and I'm a bookkeeper who freelances part-time, today was not one of my "easy" Fridays.  I've been to downtown DC and then hauled ass to another client's office in west Alexandria.  Thankfully the traffic cooperated.  I arrived home and began my arriving home routine, which consists first of greeting the animals and then letting them outside.  While they tend to their business in the backyard, my routine then takes me down the driveway to the mailbox to retrieve whatever goodies the mail carrier may have brought us.  And surprise!  Some time between when I had driven into the carport and then returned to fetch the mail a few minutes later, someone had planted a little American flag next to our mailbox!  See?   urlLink     How cool is that?

      I confess.  I was surfing around indiscriminately again.  Blindly following links and not paying attention to where I started, just to where I was going.  And sometimes I wasn't paying attention even then.  But hey, is that really something I need to confess?  I felt no guilt while doing it.  And I rarely miss an opportunity to feel guilty.  This caught my eye, mainly because we have some friends who are currently on the Weight Watchers program.  I spent the next few minutes reading through these and laughing out loud.  At work.  Really loud.  Couldn't help it though.  In my defense I was on my lunch hour.  And it's really hard to eat and laugh out loud at the same time.  Laughing is hardly against the rules at my office, but I felt rather silly laughing out loud by myself.  Our intern probably thinks I'm insane.  He couldn't help but hear me.  Check it out.  Read as you scroll down to "start the tour".  Then take the tour.  It's well worth the clicks.   urlLink Weight Watchers Recipe Cards circa 1974   You can thank me later.

      Sometimes I'm hesitant to admit it, but I've got relatives in New Jersey.  Relatives by marriage (not my own marriage, although for several years way back in the stone age I  was  married, these relatives are unrelated to those relatives who weren't from New Jersey at all).  My NJ relatives are from my Mom's marriage.  A strange bunch, those New Jerseyites.  But nice enough folks.  They talk funny.  Almost as funny as when Wendy gets around her parents and her Texas accent resurfaces (actually I find that accent of hers more sexy than funny!).  Accents can be like that.  I remember when we used to visit my grandparents in Alabama and my Mom's southern accent would come back.  Or the fellow from Boston I work with whose accent pops out every so often.  Quite amusing.  I've never considered New Jersey itself weird (my relatives are a different story!).  Then I spent some time perusing this site,  urlLink Weird NJ .  I actually found the stories there more interesting than weird.  I am fascinated by such things.  History is cool.  My mind wonders about the whys and hows and whos and whens and whats of what may have occurred within or around those strange types of places.  So this site proved quite interesting to me.  Perhaps it will be to you too.

      My friend Tina, who has read this blog, made a comment a few weeks ago about it.  She said "It's rather  personal  isn't it?"  And it is.  At times.  But it's not as personal as it could be.  And it will never be.  Because there are some things I just will not blog about.  I may write about them, but my hard drives over the years have eaten lots of stuff I have written without anyone besides myself having read it.  Stuff perhaps that I deem  really  personal.  I consider it therapy.  Cheap, inexpensive (well free actually!) therapy.  Because for me, writing is therapeutic.  And don't we all need some kind of therapy?  Life can be freaking hard at times.  This blog is just my therapy of choice.  Well,  writing  is and this blog is an extension of that.  Oddly enough, it works.  It's also fun.  And educational, both from a "learn HTML" to, at times, "achieving personal insight".  So while it is personal to a degree, it's really only one edge of personal.  I'm shy, you see.  Or I used to be way back when before parenthood put an end to that.  Yet I still think of myself that way.  Personally.

      This is about the house next door to where we used to live before we moved to where we live now. And one family who lived there while we occupied the house next door. Families moved out and in and out and in during the five year span we lived next door. A total of three families. Each one a bit different from the last.   The house next door was owned by someone who lived right down the street. I never met them. They had an agreement of some kind with the British Embassy and the first two families who lived there while we lived there were British families who were in America for a tour of duty at the Embassy. The British family who was supposed to move in after the second family left decided they'd rather live in Reston. Farewell to a sweet deal for the owner of that house.   My favorite folks who lived in that house were Jan and Grant, one of the British families. The middle one. They were there for three years while we were next door. We initially made their acquaintance the winter after they had moved in the fall prior.   There were no sidewalks in that neighborhood and between our yard and the street was a drainage ditch. Then a narrow strip of land before the pavement began. The day we met Jan and Grant, it had been snowing. Wendy's little blue truck had become mired in the mess.  Well I've never really considered snow a mess, but the narrow strip between the road and the ditch was rather messy right then because while there was snow on the ground, the ground was not completely frozen. Rather it was just wet and therefore muddy and tractionless. Wendy was trying to leave for work. So we were out there pushing and trying to get the truck onto the pavement. Completely unsuccessfully.  Out from their house came Grant. Toting a bag of icemelt. Followed closely by Jan.   They introduced themselves and got to work spreading their icemelt for traction. I was wedging sticks and other yard debris under the rear wheels to also add traction.  We all put our backs into it and, a mud fountain later, the truck was free!  Quite neighborly of them to come help.   They invited us over several times over the years.  We'd have tea with them and it was almost ceremonial.  Hearing them talk about their views of America and their own country was interesting although we didn't necessarily agree with their interpretation of our countrymen.  They didn't have any children or pets.  Jan didn't have a job outside the home and she usually seemed lonely. I don't know what they thought of us.   They took trips all over the US during their stay here.  I was (am?) rather envious of that.  They've seen more of our country than we have.

        1/8 of an inch can make a difference when setting tile. A big difference. One little 1/8 of an inch can necessitate re-doing something more than once.   Just because a person is a bookkeeper does not necessarily mean they are good at math. (Oh wait. I already knew that.)  I wish I'd paid more attention in geometry class.   Our friend Marcy is someone not to be trusted for movie recommendations. Thanks a lot Marcy. Now give us our 2 wasted hours back!  We have a herd of mosquitos living in our backyard. A fierce ferocious unrelenting herd. And they are hungry.  Sitting sideways and cross-legged in a tub for hours and hours causes my body to ache unpleasantly in all sorts of ways.   After years of cooking them wrong, I actually can now cook delicious fresh green beans.  She gives me fever. Fever in the morning. Fever all through the night.  (Oh wait.  I already knew that too!)  Pizza Hut's pizza with the built-in breadsticks on the crust is not as good as it appears in the commercials. It's not horrible, it's just not as good as thin crust. But their cinnamon sticks still rock.  Rosie the Riveter made a good point.

      Is a chore more satisfying if the work is difficult and challenging?  I'm not so sure.  I've found just motivating and actually doing a job can be satisfying whether it's as simple as doing the dishes or, as we have discovered this weekend, as difficult as tiling the bathroom.  So.  My advice.  Just get off your ass and do something.  Be the end result a shining sink or a brand new look for the bathroom.  Just being productive feels good.

      Having recently written of my love for the game Scrabble, it should be no big surprise that a  urlLink news story on the National Scrabble Championship  caught my eye.   "In the final round, eventual champion Trey Wright played the word "lez," which was on a list of offensive words not allowed during the tournament.   Normally, no word is off-limits, but because the games were being taped for broadcast on ESPN, certain terms had been deemed inappropriate, including the three-letter slang for lesbian.   "There are words you just can't show on television," Scrabble Association Executive Director John Williams said." My first thought was "Well lez isn't  really  even a word, is it?  Isn't it a slang abbreviation?  So I surfed on over to see what  urlLink dictionary.com  had to say about it.  And there I discovered that not only is it a real word, but it is "offensive slang" for lesbian and is defined as a  disparaging  term!  Well I ask you.  Who knew?  I've always considered more the way a word is used than the actual word itself to determine if it is disparaging.  Or the tone in which it is said.  While I've never personally been called "lez", at least not that I remember, I'm not sure I'd consider it offensive.  So feel free to call me lez, as long as you aren't sneering or tossing tomatoes at the same time.  And I'd just love to play that "z" on a triple word score, wouldn't you?  It also offends me a bit that a championship game of Scrabble is limited by a somewhat random list of inappropriate words just because it's going to be televised.  Isn't that where the editing process should take over?  Think of how long the list of eliminated words could be, depending on who compiled it.  Was "fag" allowed?  How about "dildo" or "poop" or "bitch"?  All perfectly good words I would not hesitate to play in Scrabble if the letters came along and the points earned satisfied me.  I'd love to see the whole list of words eliminated from that tournament.  And I wonder how many points Mr. Wright would have earned with his word "lez"?  Guess we'll never know.  Now  that's  something to find offensive.

      I spoke with my sister SK twice yesterday.  Once to find out if she had firmed up her travel plans for her return visit and then again when she called to ask a few details about said upcoming visit.  Ayup, that's right.  She was here the last week in July for the family beach trip and she'll be returning on August 17 for an extended visit.  This is cause for great celebration in our household.  Just how long is an extended visit?  Undetermined at this time.  Several weeks at least.  But she's low maintenance company.  Pretty much.  And she respects our need for privacy.  She understands if we're sitting at our computers or stretched out in bed watching baseball for hours, that's exactly where we need to be.  Or where we want to be.  And it's just fine with her.  Which is different from when, say, our parents visit.  Because then I feel the need to entertain and hang out pretty much exclusively with them.  I think they want that.  Not that I don't like to hang out with my folks.  Because I do.  And they typically only stay a few days.  I think an extended visit from my mother would drive Wendy, me  and  my mother insane.  It's just easy to maintain the thread of our usual lives during visits from my sister while enjoying her being here.  She called to ask two questions.  First, where would she have space to set up her painting?  She requires a fair amount of space and likes it to be in a living space, so she can paint and interact and watch TV.  I told her we'd get busy thinking about it and make sure she had a good spot.  Second, was there a cable hookup in her bedroom?  Well no.  Not at the moment.  But we can make it happen.  Because doing things for SK is something we like to do.  We will be enlisting her skills for our benefit while she is here.  My sister, in addition to being an artist, has been my inspiration and my "oh hell yes, we can do  that !" mentor for home improvements for a very long time.  Wendy and I purchased a fixer-upper house about a year ago.  We've tackled quite a few tough tasks so far.  And while we've made significant progress over this past year, we're in a bit of a slump.  SK, just by being here, will pull us right out of that slump and get us back on track.  She's always impressed me with her patient approach to tasks.  She knows a lot about how to fix things.  And she's quite a proficient carpenter.  We could use a few lessons.  Plus decorating.  She's got a knack for knowing just what to put where.  SK has three dogs.  Yes three.  One large, one mid-sized and one small.  She jokingly asked a few weeks ago how we'd feel about her bringing all three.  Wendy and I love dogs.  And up until a few weeks ago had three of our own.  But we're down to two.  And having three more visit would be way over the top.  Which SK understands.  But one more would be fine.  So she's bringing Nikita, the large.  Niki the Noodle has visited with us before and gets along great with the others.  So again, I rejoice.  My sister is coming! My sister is coming! Happy dances for everyone!

      This is an  urlLink interesting site  where you can plug in a date and find out what else was happening on that date and around that same time.  For instance, I know now that on the date I was born, gasoline cost $0.31 a gallon and a first class stamp was $0.04.  When Wendy popped out, gas was $0.35 and stamps were $0.06.  By the time The Boy was born, gasoline was up to $1.20 a gallon and a stamp cost $0.22.  Monopoly was deemed the "hot new toy" the year my mother was born while Nintendo earned that designation the year The Boy arrived.  As I typed this fascinating information, I began to wonder of it's relevance.  And why I find it interesting.  I'm still wondering.

      Often during holidays and such, playing games is a part of our family activities. Tradition even.  Beach trips are no exception.  It gets some of our noses out of books and others away from the TV, providing a social medium and bringing out interesting aspects of our characters.  Playing games is fun!  We all like to win of course.  Who doesn't?  Beats the heck out of the alternative.  However I've gotten better over the years at losing.  Because, despite my best efforts, I can't win all the time.  And it's really much less painful to lose when one can be a good sport about it.  Ever since The Boy was a wee lad and through the years as he grew, we played games together quite often.  He tells the story now and again of how, while teaching him to play the board game Risk, I often made him cry.  But I didn't really  make  him cry.  I just didn't  let  him win.  He would have to beat me fair and square.  Which he can now.  Because a good way to learn how to win is by losing.  And I ought to know.  My father taught me how to play chess when I was a little girl.  We made a wager.  When I finally beat him, he'd give me $5.  Financial incentive!  But it took me until I was eighteen years old to collect that $5.  Holy shit.  Either he was a really good chess player or I was a really lousy one.  Or both.  I still have the $5 bill he forked over for that win.  He wrote a congratulatory message on it.  I keep it tucked in my chess board.  Where I do believe it will forever stay tucked.  Sad thing, I'm not sure my father and I have played a game since.  Time sure gets away, doesn't it?  Scrabble is another favorite.  Well one of  my  favorites.  I like to think I'm a good Scrabble player.  There's only one person I can remember beating me consistently:  my step-mother Wanda.  She is an  incredible  Scrabble player.  The key to the game, outside of having a decent vocabulary and being a good speller, is knowing how to play for points.  Not many folks have that down.  Wanda sure does.  I have this ridiculous habit of saving old score sheets and keeping them in the Scrabble box.  Every time we pull it out to play, I can look at those winning scores and be inspired.  I don't save the score sheet when I lose however.  No surprise there, hmmm?  After all, it is  my  Scrabble board.  At the beach this year, we played dominoes quite a bit.  Playing dominoes is highly underrated, in my opinion.  It's not just a game for little old men.  We like to play Mexican Train Dominoes.  It's a rockin' game.  A little luck, a little skill.  And someone who has pulled miles ahead of everyone else can quickly be humbled by one bad round.  There are evidently many rule sets for Mexican Train, depending on what part of the country one is from or what interpretation is applied to the written rules (which are not very clear at all!).  Part of the fun of playing is analyzing the rules.  Over the years, our family has standardized the rule set we use to fit how we like to play.  My mother won every single game of Mexican Train dominoes we played that week.   Every single game .  I was in second place every single game with the exception of one.  Not that I was keeping track or anything.  Yeah right.  There was a score sheet tucked into their dominoes bin from last Thanksgiving.  I had stashed it in there.  The Boy had beaten us all by a wide margin.  Somehow, I get as much satisfaction when he wins as when I do.

      Last Christmas our friend Tom gave us a couple of books.  Fluffy fun stuff mainly.  One of them is entitled “Presidential (Mis)Speak:  The Very Curious Language of George W. Bush,  Volume 1”.  My first thought was “Volume 1?  Volume 1?  How many volumes are there?!”  I’m still not sure.  The title of this post is from Volume 1, a Bush quote from the May 10, 2000 edition of the  The Dallas Morning News .  Today he spit out another  urlLink prize .  "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," Bush said.  "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we." His faithful lap dog McClellan followed with this:   “…the American people know this president speaks with clarity and conviction…” Uh.  Doh.  That’s exactly what I’m afraid of.  Please let the past be over.  Pretty please?  With sugar on top?

      There was a message on our answering machine Tuesday from BG.  By the way, BG is how I refer to The Boy's father herein.  For simplicity.  It stands for Big Greg, which was appropriate when The Boy was younger but now it's just silly because The Boy grew so he now towers over all his parents.  Especially his dad.  But we still call him Big Greg.  Habit and such.  Plus Old Greg just doesn't roll off the tongue quite the same and doesn't sound very nice.  He wanted to let us know The Boy was in the   urlLink Virginian-Pilot  , a newspaper with circulation in the Hampton Roads-Norfolk-Virginia Beach area.  BG's father had seen it and called him.  It was something about the dance production he appeared in recently, associated with his summer job.  We don't get the  Pilot  up here in Northern Virginia.  I'm going to go to the library and hope they have it.  Which they probably do.  Meanwhile I combed their on-line edition and couldn't find it.  Boo hoo.  I  need  those simple pleasures, don't ya know?  And I don't even know what it is.  A picture?  A sentence?  Both?  I am pathetic, aren't I?  I'm again confronted with the reality of The Boy being gone.  Wendy and I were used to being there for  all  of his performances and activities.  I've got clippings of all newspaper articles and mentions along with every show program and poster.  And pictures of course.  During his first year in college, we traveled down to see him in a few things and I have mementoes from those.  But we didn't get to see him in everything he did.  Nor every performance.  We had to adjust.  It's not all bad, I guess.  But now he's out there in the real world, albeit in a limited way.  And I won't necessarily know about every mention made or picture published.  It makes me sad but I can't really put into words why.

      Today, or yesterday I guess I should say, was the kind of day that tried to wipe out the remaining traces of I've-been-on-vacation euphoria. Welcome back to the real world. Bound to happen sooner or later I suppose.  My drive into the District was pleasant enough. The traffic was surprisingly light. Tourists and their sightseeing buses didn't block every intersection. There was no snaking line of humanity awaiting entry to the Holocaust Museum nor the Treasury Building. While there was one large group clad in matching red t-shirts hovering near the crosswalk by the Washington Monument, they didn't impede my right-turn-on-red by stepping out into the road as such groups usually do. I timed things so I would arrive at my job site at 10:00, but traffic was so smooth I arrived at 9:30 instead. Vacation groove still grooving or folks staying away because of the heightened terror alert?  Either way, I'll take it.  Work went smoothly. I was out of there only 30 minutes later than I intended, which I suppose really translates into an hour  longer  than I intended to be there because I had arrived early.  Oh well.  I was still pretty much on schedule.  Here's where the day started to lose it's shine. I had to wait 30 minutes to get my car out of the parking garage. And it was hot.  And humid.  Like only DC in August can be humid.  And I had to stand in the sun.  In a noisy alley.  And I was sweating.  In my city clothes.  Blech. I guess the typically efficient parking folks were taking a vacation of their own.  Finally got my car. But then a handicapped transit van blocked the alley exit while a man in a wheelchair was loaded on and strapped in. How could I possibly be irritated by a handicapped individual screwing up my time schedule? At least I was in the car with the A/C on full blast.  I took the opportunity to look up.  Usually when I walk or drive in the city, my attention is focused on where I am going.  Eye levelish.  Or downward so I don't trip on a curb or something.  Looking up in the city exposes a whole new set of sights.  There are some beautiful buildings in DC, with filigreed construction and interesting decorative exteriors.  So the day still had some of it's shine.  Until I realized I'd left the paperwork for my next job at home.  On the dining room table.  Where I distinctly remembered putting it next to my purse.  My purse made it into the car.  The paperwork didn't.  I've given up carrying my briefcase because I'd stuff so much crap in it I'd get a shoulder ache from carrying it around all day.  But had I still been using it, the paperwork would not be sitting on the dining room table when it needed to be with me.  Envision a triangle.  An equilateral triangle.  It represents the travel route I was to take that day.  Point A to Point B to Point C to Point A.  Simple and expedient.  Avoiding suburban roads and using highways at off-peak hours to optimize my time.  But now, because of my carelessness, my route would have to be Point A to Point B to Point A to Point C to Point A.  Have I lost you yet?  The shine was fading again despite my desire to retain it.  Gas costs $1.99 a gallon around here right now at the cheap stations after all.  And time is money too.  So I finally got to Point C after an additional trip to Point A.  I was an hour later than I told them I'd be.  Grrrrr.  And things were rather fubared there.  They are in the middle of a major computer upgrade and the office was packed with things that don't belong.  This particular client is a restaurant.  And if you've never seen a restaurant's office, I'll tell you they are typically squeezed into an out of the way space.  And they're small.  And cramped.  Particularly today because of all the extra equipment.  But hey, I'm adaptable.  I don't mind climbing over, squeezing by, stretching around, mousing with my left hand... well you get the picture.  But lordie was it hot in that office!  I'm mean sweating-while-you-are-sitting-still hot.  Typically when the door is closed it cools off.  Not today.  The A/C, just in the office mind you, was malfunctioning.  And I was still in my city clothes.  Not good.  Not good at all.  I should have taken time to change clothes during my additional stop at Point A.  But my work there went fairly smoothly too.  Despite the temperature.  I made it back to Point A.  I've got a cat in my lap and a dog at my feet. In my pajamas.  Me, not the dog.  My girlfriend is warming up our bed.  And the Orioles won a double-header today... err... yesterday.  What the hell am I whining for?

      When I was a child, our family often took road trips during the summer to visit the grandparents.  In one way, our family was unfortunate because we didn't get to live in the same town as the grandparents.  But we were fortunate in another way because both sets of grandparents lived in the same city.  One trip, both sets.  And now we all have our fond memories of those road trips to savor at will.   This was before the family got a little labyrinthine due to divorce and re-marriage. Then we had two new sets of grandparents for a total of four sets (I did the math for you folks who may be a little math-challenged).  While two sets still lived in the same town, one new set lived all the way across the country and the other one lived about as far north from our house as the original sets lived south.  Clear as mud isn't it?  Extended families make life more complex, but usually in a good way.   Anyway.  We would all pack our suitcases and pile into the old Ford Sedan.  My sister and I shared the backseat.  Shared probably isn't the best word for what we did because invariably we'd get squirmy and irritable and the old "Mom!  Her finger is on my half of the seat!!" type argument would break out.  At times we did share nicely however.  It was a two day trip from Alexandria to Montgomery, Alabama.  I have no real memories of staying at hotels, but I know we did.  It was during one of those trips when I fixated on the difference between a hotel and a motel.  For some reason I was convinced that hotels had bathrooms while motels did not.  I know better now.  We had a list of Ten Rules for Family Car Trips that were rigidly enforced.  I distinctly remember there being ten rules, but I can only remember what three of them were.  So maybe it was only these three that were rigidly enforced and the other seven were fluff.    Rule Number One:  Nothing on the back shelf    Children usually need lots of entertainment on road trips.  My sister and I were no exception.  So while we were allowed to bring pretty much whatever we wanted to bring, we were required to keep it within certain parameters.  The back shelf of the car was out of bounds for storage.     Rule Number Three:  Everyone must use the bathroom immediately before getting in the car    Obvious reason for that rule.  The rule was enforced for the dog too.     Rule Number Five:  No asking "When are we going to get there?"    Or any other form of a question that requires the same type of answer.  For instance "How much longer?" or "Can we get out of the car soon?"  Again, obvious need.  Because children can be impatient like that.  And what parent wants to hear that question over and over again, particularly when there are at least 15 more hours of highway ahead?  As an adult when embarking on road trips with family or friends, I only invoke Rule Number Three.  Not that it helps when traveling with my sister SK.  Once in not too distant yet not too recent times, we were road tripping together to New Jersey for Christmas at Cathy's, my step-sister from my father's side.  We were in separate automobiles.  This was during the time SK lived nearby in Maryland.  She was in her auto and we were in ours.  Cosine and Detail and The Boy and me.  So we set off on that bright clear December morning, full of excitement and anticipatory pleasure at spending the holidays with our father and extended family.  This was before the age of common cell phones.  So we had devised a simple communication system.  If one or the other of us needed to stop for whatever reason, the driver would simply flash their headlights to inform the other car.  Simple.  Effective.  Communicative.  However I was totally totally taken aback when, before we had even reached Baltimore, SK was frantically flashing her headlights for a break.  A potty break as it turned out.  Bear in mind that Baltimore is about an hour from where our trip originated.  One hour.  60 minutes.  3,600 seconds.  One short little hour.  I was just getting into my driving groove.  When I pulled over into the rest stop, my irritation at stopping so soon into our travels was evidently more than apparent.  SK held up a large water bottle, like a two-liter size, and announced she consumed the whole thing.  Which is why she had to pee.  And would have to pee again in the not-too-distant-future.  Argh.  I contemplated adding a new rule.  Rule Number 3A.  No drinking water.  Or if one must have water, no swallowing.  Instead I just became resigned to expect frequent stops.  So my sister could pee.  Again.  It was the humanitarian thing to do after all.  On our recent trip to Rehoboth, SK was again caravaning with us in a separate automobile because she unfortunately had to depart two days earlier than the rest of us.  We all have cell phones now.  Communication by flashing lights was rendered obsolete.  Progress I guess.  We had just reached the slow traffic approaching the Bay Bridge.  Bumper to bumper.  Creeping.  Not unexpected.  We'd been on the road, oh, maybe an hour.  My cell phone rang.  Ayup.  SK needed to pee.  Bless her heart.  (There's a joke there but you don't know it because I haven't shared it with you.  Just go with the flow.  Bless your heart.)  So we worked our way over three lanes of bumper-to-bumper traffic and pulled into the Wawa.  Again, my irritation was evidently apparent even though I really really tried to conceal it.  Guess I still have some work to do in that area.  While we were there, we got coffee and doughnuts just because.  One box of powdered doughnettes for SK and one box for Wendy and me.  And no, we didn't empty the boxes.  There were plenty left over to share with others at the beach.  Life's really too short to begrudge a potty stop to my sister.  Did a time schedule really matter that much?  We  were  on vacation after all.

      No, not on the phone. From the kitchen. Where they are hermetically sealed in their extra-large bag (because a family of two cannot  possibly  be satisfied with a normal-sized bag). The package is in plain view on the countertop. Not in the cupboard where they belong. Actually they belong in my stomach. Or they think they do. Which is why they are calling. Heaven forbid I derail their pursuit of destiny.  Oh wonderful glorious Cheesy Poofs! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in celebration of orange fingertips, salty crunchy goodness, and non-nutritive extraneous fat grams. We wallow in the profound sensorial pleasures exclusively derived from stuffing one's mouth with corny crunchy cheesy poofy curls. Licking one's fingers is merely a bonus. Actually that's the gross part, but it comes with the territory and is part of the overall experience. Can't be avoided, so might as well embrace it? Resistance is futile.  I introduced Alice to cheesy poofs last week. Who's Alice? Why Alice is the newest member of our family! My step-sister Joan adopted her from Guatemala and brought her home just this past May. She's fourteen months old and, as many babies can be, is most adorable. Part of me feels terrible for plying her with junk food but in my defense, isn't that a prerogative of an aunt? The cheesy poofs  were  Utz brand. No sane individual can resist Utz brand cheesy poofs. I was merely testing her sanity. By the way she snatched that cheesy poof from my hand and instinctively took one happy bite and then another while gripping it in her steely grasp, I have deemed her mental health certifiably stable. At least for the time being. The long term experiment, that of Joan being her mom, may eventually erase all traces of sanity. That's a joke. I think.  It had been a while since Wendy or I were around a baby for longer than a day. We both really like babies. What's not to like? And Alice in particular is easy to like. Friendly, sweet, independent, adorable. She greeted us with her newest skill: a sweet kiss on the cheek. After that display, resistance was futile in her case also. I'd gush about her cute sundresses and pajamas and swimsuits but that would be a little over the top. Instead I'll gush about how she took to the sand and surf and made it her own. Fall down in the sand? No problem! Hop right back up and totter around some more. Get a mouthful of sand? No problem! Crunch it a bit then spit it out. Slide into a hole someone dug? No problem! Climb right back out, slide in again, and play peek-a-boo over the edge. Waves? No problem! Chilly ocean? No problem! Bring it on! Bonnet power!!    urlLink      In addition to cheesy poofs, I contributed to Alice's eating education in another important way. We all walked down to the boardwalk after dinner one evening for ice cream. Joan spooned a few bites into Alice's mouth. She liked it of course. I had my ice cream on a cone.  Soft-serve peppermint.  On a cake cone.  Squatting down by the stroller, I demonstrated to Alice how to lick ice cream from a cone. She caught on quick, that little girl. Her tongue snaked right out and expertly licked my proffered cone. I'm certain the look of intense satisfaction on her face was not my imagination.  Welcome to America, Alice. We're glad you are here.

      Wendy and I have survived another family week at the beach. Well, survived is probably not the right word even though we did survive. Enjoyed is closer to the truth. Reveled in is even more accurate.  Our family gathering was held again in  urlLink Rehoboth Beach, Delaware . I believe my folks chose that location due to it being pretty much geographically in the middle of where each family contingent originates. Except for my sister of course, but then there are no beaches geographically central to Arizona, New Jersey and Virginia.  The New Jerseyites spend half their travel time on the Cape May ferry instead of fighting the traffic on Route 50 to cross the terror that is the Bay Bridge. (I know I'm not the only one who finds it terrifying because it's one of those bridges that provides an escort service for fearful drivers. Not that I'd make use of such a service. I'm stubborn and such and a few more terror-induced gray hairs on my head won't even be noticed.)  Wendy and I especially enjoy Rehoboth because it is a gay friendly town.  More than gay friendly.  Rainbow flags are everywhere.  Gay bars and clubs and shops and people abound.  We can walk the boardwalk holding hands when the mood strikes---a real bonus.  It's also a traditional family beach town.  Heteros and homos peacefully co-exist.  It's a beautiful thing.  We were the last group to arrive.  Consequently our room had been pre-selected for us.  For reasons unknown, the early arrivals put Wendy and I at the top of the house in the only room with a private balcony.  Equipped with two chairs and a little table.  Our own personal refuge from the chaos family gatherings can bring.  It's like they knew how much we need our private space.  Excellent.  Oh the stories I shall tell about the dysfunction of our family members!  But in a kind way.  Because it takes all sorts of humans to make up this oddball world in which we live.  Right now I'm going to enjoy being home, making up with our pets for leaving them behind while we cavorted and vacationed.  And I've got to catch up on paperwork and prepare for the week ahead.  It's the first of the month after all and you know what that means for me.  Coming home can be infinitely more satisfying than departing, in my own humble opinion.
