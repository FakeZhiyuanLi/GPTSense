       Clothes, clothes...:) they are one of my favorite life selections, whether in Animal Crossing or real life...right at home in New Hampshire. ;) I just love clothes. Now I am going to tell you about your clothing selections for female characters ONLY...sorry but I haven't time for the males, I've got to tell you, they DON'T wear attractive clothes, so...yeah, you get it, right??  First things first, the Tailor. Ah, the Tailor. The Able Sisters' Shop is located usually in one of the F acres, and you can design clothing. Set up your clothes on the racks in their shop and you may find yourself a natural clothing designer!! EVERYONE, within a few months, in the town, will wear your clothes, unless one of your townsfolk chats with another and changes into new clothes that she/he received from the neighbor. So the Tailor's cool...oh and you can also set up your own designs in your house too....mix it up or flash it out just the way it is!! And if you want, you can make your designs wallpaper, though most designs spoil your soon-to-be fab walls, and chomp away at your precious HRA points. But you can change your walls and floors later, so don't worry!  Now...there's style for you! :) It doesn't matter what you wear, just what you like. I pick bright-colored, dark-colored and patterned shirts, like Pop Bloom Shirt, ShortCake Shirt, and Nebula Shirt. Just pick what you want. Oh, and if you would like to know, you change in a flash of glitter on your screen (drag a piece of clothing to you and you'll change) so don't get your hopes up for...ya know....anyway, you're just a kid, so...why would anybody be that disgusting anyway?? It's a kids' game!!!

       Animal Crossing is a game where you control your own little character. (Very well designed, great graphics, the characters are chubby and not so anime). If you are hooked on anime games, do not choose Animal Crossing. It's not really an action-packed game, not an RPG, even. It's mostly an adventure or strategy game, like Harvest Moon AWL, also a favorite of mine. (I'm on the 3rd chapter) I feel really important sitting in this chair, typing up this guide for you, and luckily you're on my good side right now so I'm gonna explain to you what the main features of the game are. If you'll listen, you're a good egg. By the way;;;what came first, the chicken or the egg? Oh never mind.  Okay. The best part of the game is that the seasons change, weather changes, and time changes. Time changes exactly like it does in real life, but the weather is completely random. In the winter, you can build snowmen. In the summer, travelers from other towns stop in and camp out. (There at least a 39% chance that the campers will move into your village). If your village is clean and well-kept (it should be all the time) then new animals will move into your town. Just a quick note:  not all animals are friendly.  There's male and female, just like the human world. I'll describe the types of the genders when we move on.  The worst part of animal crossing is that...well, it has to be updated frequently. If you don't keep up your town, your best animal friend may move out! So pull weeds, pick stuff off the ground, dig up stuff from cracks, and send animals letters (also talk to them). It's also good for you to travel to another town. On a regular memory card you can fit one town. I have four memory cards, myself, so I have four towns: Suntown, (my first; don't laugh at the name) Confuzzd, Snorkd, and Blorgen. Amanda is my character of Suntown, Confuzin lives in Confuzzd, Someone lives in Snorkd, and Frog lives in Blorgen. Even if you have a memory card with 1200 blocks, still only one town can fit on your memory card. That's another bad thing about the game.  Okay so I only have female characters. Bummer, eh? ;) Well, for now, I can tell you only the faces that female characters can have. What you pick for answers to Rover on the train, when you first start out, doesn't really affect your character's looks. It's 86% random, so just give it up, okay? If you're the kind of person who likes to do things even though they are warned not to, and the kind of person who likes to waste time, choose your answers with Rover then look at the face when you hop off the train. Then, reset your game and choose the same answers. There'll be (usually) a different girls' face. I think it goes in order. The following descriptions are in the order that I got them. DON'T depend on it that your order will be the same. Just the descriptions.  1. There's one with pink hair and round eyes, with three eyelashes from the bottom. She's like, the emblem of Animal Crossing, I think, because whenever I do a google search for Animal Crossing girl pictures, she's the one who pops up. She would go so good with a pink tartan, or many a pink shirt. Try different combinations.  2. Then there's a girl with pink hair and oval eyes with one eyelash from the left side of her face. She's kind of a girly-girl...she has black eyes and two white circles inside them. Wear a shortcake shirt. Trust me, it rules.  3. Okay...the blue hair and tired-looking eyes are kind of convincing...usually what you'd look like in real-life if you were playing Animal Crossing all night long. No further information is required for you to visualize this one. ;) Wear a blue shirt if you want her to be stylin'.  4. This one's weird. She has Japanese eyes, but oddly enough, one of the black pupils is closer to the end of her eye than the other. She has blue hair. I named this girl "Ellie".  5. This one's cute. She has brown hair, and half-moon eyes with a brown pupil. Then she has one eyelash...one on the left side of the left eye, one on the right side of her right eye. She's beautiful, so I named this one after me, Amanda. With this doll-face, you can dress her in anything, but I'd advise shirts with not alot of patterns.  6. There's ANOTHER pink-haired girl, but she has three lashes ABOVE her round eyes instead of BELOW. Nothing much to say about her, except the fact that she has green eyes. She's kind of pretty, but I think she'd best go with green and blue clothing colors.  7. There's also a girl who has brown hair, pink cheeks and black eyes with half-moons in them. Really pretty, kind of dressy. I would suggest, on her, light blue, orange, and pink, light pastel colors, of course. Oh, and anything you design, besides black clothes, will fit perfectly on her.

       Ever wanted to just go out there and  paint the town red?  Was it ever your dream to live in a place where YOU do the major home design how you dig it, YOU try on a new 'do and clothing design and wear it every day? Did you ever want to make your own clothing design famous among at least fifteen inhabitants throughout a big area? Or did you just want to chill, pick fruit, bug the neighbors, and dig up treasure?  Move over Nookington's,  'cause KonfuzzdKat's got some stuff in stock for you!  Sick of all your other games?? What you need is a good dose of Animal Crossing. All you need to do is get yourself to a computer near you (hopefully you are already at one; it would be pretty sad if you're not) and locate the nearest game store. Prescribe yourself to a bottle of fun when you run to the store and purchase  Animal Crossing.  Once ya get on this game, it's hard to get off, let me tell ya.   I would rate this game, out of  five  stars, probably a  four . This site is a walking guide to Animal Crossing. Feel free to bookmark this page, or even print out some information. Just don't claim it as your own...:P  Okay so what I'm going to do is explain how to get some fast money, how to deck out your house in whichever way you want it to be, but still have room for some extra HRA points (I'll get to what those are later too) and read the next post for some high-def information about this awesome and new game!!

      Okay, my name is KonfuzzdKat. You might remember me from one of my past blogs,  urlLink http://turnontheanimalcrossing.blogspot.com . Yes, I do love video games, so I'm going to rate the best and worst games for you. K?  First of all, I'm going to rate video games by...the price range, the console, the graphics, gameplay, overall rating, and my observation of the age-group. Got it? It should look somewhat like this.  Name of Game: Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire Price range: $39.99 av. Console: GameBoy Advance Graphics: 2/5 Gameplay/Story: 4/5 Overall Rating: 3/5 Age Group: Everyone Comments: I like this game. It has a kind of attitude that makes you determined to "catch 'em all"!  Before I rate more games, I want to explain to you my age group ratings, and why I chose them. I don't think ESRB ratings are my style now, so I'm gonna rate them how I want.   Early Childhood: Suitable for children under 5 years old. A learning game with an attitude that younger kids are particularly fond of, so...no more on this.  Everyone: Some content which is only suitable for the older kids, like, 10+. Some mild humor, mild graphics, and ya know...fun for older kids, like un-Barney stuffs.  Teen: Some blood, crude humor, mild language, and content which older teens will be more able to understand...you know, bad stuff.  Mature: I'll get back to you on this one. You know about this. Ratings.
