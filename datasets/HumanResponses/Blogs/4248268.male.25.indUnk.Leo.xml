      How is it that the man you have come to know and love, is not the man he once was?  Why is it that when you embarked upon this relationship he was so seemingly perfect?  Even after the “honeymoon period” of your relationship he was so proficient at keeping you lighthearted and content.  Now he is just an ass…..   What Happened?   Well as we all know the beginning of any relationship is always “peaches & cream”, but what happens when the smoke clears?  You see it take anywhere from about 3 months to about 2 years until you really know a person and they really know you.  In this time fame of an almost seamless utopia you have both cloaked yourselves as the others perfect match.  Now once the veil has been lifted and everything is finally out in the open is when the other side of the same person walks in, almost unknowingly to you until it is too late.  You see now that he knows you and has gained your trust he can just about get away with anything, including the bullshit that you said that you would never put up with.    How?     Now I can’t fully explain how ore why this happens but I will do my best. You see not only male nature but human nature enables us to adapt to just about any situation, even a relationship.  It goes down like this, each and every day you get more and more comfortable with each other, therefore you let more things slip through the cracks that are starting to form in your so called perfect world. As he sees this happening he is going to push the envelope more and more, but because you love him and because he was always so sweet you let him slide.  By the time reality hits and you figure out what’s really going on you’re ready to kill him.   Keep It Interesting...   Well don’t jump the gun to fast this can be fixed if you are both willing to change, and just take a little time out for each other.  Now from this point on there has to 100% cooperation from both sides it’s gets a little uneasy for some people in the beginning right here, but the one thing that would keep this from happening is  communication . The more you and your partner communicate abut what’s going on in the relationship the better it will become, and wonderful thing about it is, it’s almost never to late to start.  By having everything out in the open you can keep the relationship interesting, and whenever a problem arises you are both readily able to take care of it. So guys don’t let you pride get in the way because it can get a little emotional, and ladies just take your time with him because he is not going to want to talk about it.    Happiness   Now the idea of a perfect relationship is kind of fare fetched, it just doesn’t exist, but the idea of a happy relationship is well attainable.  Just keep one thing in mind, if you just talk about how the relationship is going and how you feel the possibilities are end less as to how far your relationship will go.    Patience serves as a protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold. For if you put on more clothes as the cold increases, it will have no power to hurt you. So in like manner you must grow in patience when you meet with great wrongs, and they will then be powerless to vex your mind.

      Women of today hear me out on this one; a male by nature is a survivor, a provider, a thinker, and deep down inside a lover (well most of us anyway). Yet right beside that lover is a fear of failure, not only of failing his significant other, but also of failing himself.  You see I know from experience that emotional agony is a pain that can linger, physical pain is something that you can look past. That emotional pain affects every part of your life it can put you in the deepest of depressions during the happiest of times. Men can not deal with that as well as women, we don’t know how to talk it out, so we find other way of dealing with it which may seem as though we are uninterested. Men shy away from emotion weather it be good or bad, not knowing how to nurture it we just hold it deep down inside.   The Hit & Run  Many people can identify with this one, you both have a great date things are going really well then its back to the spot for a little sumthin mellowsmooth. You’ll have your passionate fun in all it’s lascivious glory, and then not to long after he has to go.  You have just fallen victim to the Hit &amp; Run.  Now before I go any further let me say this is not true for all guys, some have legitimate reason for having to leave like this. After the act of sex a male is at his one of his most emotional states. You can ask him just about anything and his answer will come from his heart and not from his head. The thing is, a lot of guys know this so there for the run from it. Emotion feeling weather they are good or bad are hard for most guys to deal with.   Not Interested or Just Doesn’t Care?  Many women may question “is he uninterested in me or does he just not care”? Well the answer to that varies from relationship to relationship, but in most cases it is neither. It all goes back to not knowing how to deal with emotions and that fear of failure. Instead of putting ourselves out there we just ball it all up and hold it on the inside and put on this façade of nonchalant feeling that just act as a shell of true emotions.   Help???  Yes there is a way to help, but you have to be patient and you can’t give up. First of all you have to realize that this is going to take some time, it’s not going to change over night. You have to nurture his emotion for him, by doing this he will get some acceptance for himself and learn that emotional pain is only as painful as you make it. Don’t expect huge accomplishment at one at one time, you have to take baby steps on this one it seems to him to be a lot to take in. And finaly, joy and pain are the ying and yang of a relationship share both of these. Without joy there is no pain, and without pain there is no joy. Don’t ball your feelings up because that is just a time bomb waiting to explode.      It is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all.

        Ingenious  , I have for some odd reason been fascinated with this word, and I can’t really explain why.  Merriam-Webster defines this word as follows;  1:  obsolete : showing or calling for intelligence, aptitude, or discernment 2: marked by especial aptitude at discovering, inventing, or contriving 3: marked by originality, resourcefulness, and cleverness in conception or execution I consider myself to be the latter of the three.   Who am I?  I am a poet, a musician, a cook, a photographer, a thinker, and whatever else comes to your mind.  I am a challenge seeker ready for what ever is put in front of me, dish it out and I will handle it.    Really , who am I?  Well you will just have to stick around to find out.  Anyway welcome to my site, my little piece of the information superhighway.   What will I do  with this so called uncensored piece of absolutely nothing?  Well I have not figured that out yet, but rest assured that what ever it is it will be interesting.   To end out this first post of mine I will leave you with this thought:  Watch your thoughts; they become words.  Watch your words; they become actions.  Watch your actions; they become habits.  Watch your habits; they become character.  Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.
