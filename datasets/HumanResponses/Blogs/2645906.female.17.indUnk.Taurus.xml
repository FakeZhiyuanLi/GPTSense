      Wow. Third post today! Anyways. Gah it's cold and last week it was like 70 or something! weird! i just got home from taking Stacie home. We went to FoodWorld and took Andrew a birthday card and then ate! I'm glad me and her are talkin again. I mean we've always talked! Considering she's my cousin but we haven't been close enuf to hang out in a while and now she's a pretty good friend of mine. Mom's excited about it because she's family and she says I need family and stuff right now and Stacie is my age so I can talk to her about this stuff a lot easier than I can talk to other people about it! I'm probably gonna go get Tristan when he finishes eating too! I talked to him on the phone a few minutes ago and he sounded like something was wrong! :( I guess we'll find out later!? I love him anyways! *Hugz n kisses Tristan! ;)* Jessica...even though you probably wont be getting on anytime soon cause you think you'll be grounded or w/e..I want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what! I luv u hun!

      Well. I had a great day yesterday!.. Besides school. It was a normal day, went to school....took Tristan home....went  home. Then I went with Jessica and ate at Pizza Hut then we went to Wal Mart! We had fun! :) And for the first time in FOREVER I talked to my GREAT friend Jody! Today I'm not really sure exactly WHAT I'm doing! Either something with my cousin, Stacie. Something with Jessica again. OR something with Tristan! I've been doing really good to keep my surgery off my mind and stuff! OHHH Ms. Bates just said we were going to New Orleans! I'm excited! This means 3 trips in 1 school year for me! New York, New Orleans, and wherever the Jazz Band goes! :) Well that's bout it!! *Luvz* ~I love you Tristan!~

      Well I really do hate these things but I'm trying to find some way to make me feel better about my surgery and stuff so I figured I'd give this a try...and if I don't like it then I just won't keep it up! Just in case you don't know what's going on with me, I have this disease called ulcerative colitis and I've had it since I was in like the 1st grade, I've always known that colon cancer was prolly gonna happen, but I guess I tried to make myself not believe it. I don't have it yet. But my doc said that if they don't remove my colon within a year and a half I WILL without a doubt have it. It's been really hard on me and especially hard on my parents. But considering I have AWESOME friends like Jessica, Chrissie, Alicia, Monica...and a GREAT b/f...*Tristan* I really think I'll be able to get through this. I'm just glad all that stupid drama has stopped for now, 'cause with everything goin on with me right now I really don't need that crap right now. And if you're reading this...that's why I didn't say anything in YOUR blogs. So for a while can we just ignore eachother like we've been doing? I don't need anymore stress than I already have. I'd really appreciate it. Anyways I wanna say thanks for bein there to my GREAT friends...and I love all of you. *hugz n kisses Tristan!*

      this weekend was pretty good...acutally it was a little better than good! :) saturday i WAS gonna get to go to tristan's and watch a dvd w/rachel and justin. but when tristan and rachel were on there way over they went to get gas and tristan pumped too much so they didnt have enuf money and they had to wait for tristan's dad to bring money. well rachel ended up goin and hangin somewhere else and tristan ended up here. so we ended up together after all! :) and spending an hour and a half alone sittin here talkin and huggin! then yesterday *sunday* i went to church with my grandmother and mom. then i came back home and when i was about to eat and tristan came over and stayed til like 7:30! it was great we danced and he sang to me. he sings sooo great! i'm so glad i'm the one he sings to! ok if u know me .. i talk a lot! i mean come on .. i'm a teenage girl. well lastnight there was more than one time that he left me speechless. and he just took my breath away by some of the things he said to me. i truly love him!  wednesday i'm goin to pizza hut w/jessica! i'm excited! what a way to spend the day b4 i go into the hospital?! i mean really with my bestfriend at our favorite place to eat! HEY! it'll keep my mind off things! we have a lot of catching up to do too so...it's great that we have a "date!" hehe.  life's pretty good right now! school's almost over for them so that means i'll acutally get to see them! i wish i could go to graduation tho.but i'll be at memory day tomorrow! which willllll make me CRY! :(.  well i guess that's about it!  *luvz*  *i love tristan....BUNCHES!!!!!!!*

      well...poor tristan calls me when he gets home VERY happy to talk to me and then he tells me bout his day! his math teacher couldnt get his test graded cause she had to go to a wedding rehersal which really made the day BAD cause he couldnt get ungrounded but HOPEFULLY i'll get to see him tomorrow! and SOME people need to learn to keep there hands OFF my boyfriend. REALLY i mean ya'll ARE friends and i dont have a problem with that for the FIRST time since 9th freakin grade but DO NOT touch him OBVIOUSLY he doesnt like it...he proved that today i HOPE. what he did was kinda wrong but HOPEFULLY he got the point across!!!  oh and today me and him realized that wow you may not realize how someone REALLY is. but let me ask you a couple things you'll prolly agree with me...: 1) if you're gonna talk about someone behind their back shouldnt you talk to someone that's NOT that persons boyfriend/girlfriend?! ..uhh YEAH 2) you DONT call someone one of your BEST friends and go talk about them behind their back right?! mmmmm hmmM! 3) should you talk bout your BEST friend's g/f or b/f behind their backs TO them?! *no hint hint it's their b/f or g/f! they WONT like it whether youre their "best" friend or NOT* 4) if you havent been around for a FEW months should you start judging someone before you see how they are for your self?! NO...people change. i'm not gonna say any names right now but gah this guy was one of our best friends and today he was takin tristan home and he started dishing out all this stuff about me. and when tristan tried to say something he just told him to "SHUT UP". i dont know what was wrong with him but it's not like him and i'm gonna find out what's goin on. I HOPE.  sorry all this was .. was goin off and bein upset but i had to get it out SOME how! i'm not putting names tho.  well i love tristan...VERY much.  Later!

      well the doctors visit went fairly well. she said that everything was fine and it all looked really good. so that's one really gooooood thing that happened today.  tristan didnt get to get ungrounded today! dang it! it's not cause he didnt try. he really did. i'm gonna try not to get my hopes up about him gettin ungrounded soon but he should i mean he's doin really good. it's so hard tho..when we get to talk cause when we have to stop and get off the phone or something we both cry. it's like he moved or something even tho i know he didnt and i still have him here with me...but not WITH me. i dunno i'm gonna go. :( :( :( i miss tristan SO much and love him SO SO SO much too! *i should get to see him sunday at church tho!

      i was about to go to bed and i thought i'd blog again cause i'm not too tired. i doubt they'll find anything wrong with me tomorrow. i really HOPE they dont. but i'm too far along for anything to go that wrong i mean even the surgeon said that. tuesday is what i'm the MOST nervous about cause that's when i find out if i can have the other surgery soon or not. i HOPE i do. just to get it all over with and start getting on with my life. so i can start playing the trumpet again and so i can get back MY chair in symphonic band. if i had made a tape *which wasnt physically possible* i would be 4th or 5th chair cause thats where i've been for the past 2 years. but because i didnt get to i'm last, i'm gonna challenge everyone in front of me until i get up there again cause it's my senior year i cant stay back there and none of my close friends are on that side of the room :(. tristan, jessica, ryan, justin....all them great ppl are on the other side..and i'm gettin back over there as fast as i can. i know i can do it..i'll just have to practice. and i WILL.   tristan if u read this in the morning..i hope to talk to you during ur lunch break so you can ease my mind about goin to the doc..cause you're the only one that REALLY can. just hearin you say "i love and miss you so much baby" gets me so bad that i just think "i need to do this and i WILL be ok" you're the greatest and dont you EVER forget how much i care about you and love you! *hugz baby! i love you*  gonna go now! *luvz* i love tristan
