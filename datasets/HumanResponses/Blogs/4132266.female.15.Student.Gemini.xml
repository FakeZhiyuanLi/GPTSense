      sam is sooo the man! he is so damn sexy! just kidding.....he's this this deaf indian pothead that wi just got done talkign to for the last two hours...boy he lieks to hit on us.... now you may have noticed that when i refer to myself i say wi. this is because this is nto only one person's blog..it is a joint blog between friends. and we ussually will be writing in it together. so when we refer to our selves, we have deided that instead of sayign i or we..we will forever say wi. make sense? i thought so.....i think sam is wearign off on us....  so wi just sarted this blogging stuff...wi have decided to start it after secretly readign one of our friends blogs...shhhh.... it was quite entertaining, and who doesn't llike to be entertaining these days? hillary duff sure does! our friend's secret blog tells us all her inner thoughts..so really its good that we read it right? and i mean..it helps us understand and know her better. right? well, i geuss its too bad that she doesn't want us to know her inner thoughts...but seriously here..if you didn't want peopel readign your thoughts... don't put them online! i mean...goodness....   sure should be spelled...sher..shouldn't it? well... that was my random thought for the day...  sam(the funny deaf man) has turned us onto reagae music..is that how you spell reagea...?.. ok..so he hasn't really turned us onto it, (like sam could really turn anything on...)but we liek to say he has..its good for his soul..and our karma..you know? here are soem of the hillarious things our potheaded sam has said: -i dont have any now you crazy motherfucker - i hear meghan chiefes (just to let youknow chiefes means smokes ;-) ) -i like your booty -in fact i dont think none of y'all like me -you silly bunny rabbit ok...so maybe you had to be there for most of these hillarious sam coments..but keep in mind he was completely messed up when he said these things.... and just so you know, he's not totallydeaf..just partially....just so you know we're not evil or anything.  so it is quite early in the morning here in p-town oregon...or quite late..if your one of those glass is half empty type people....and we have to baby sit in 6 1/2 hours. so i'm thinkin' maybe wi should go. goodness, i keep screwing up on the wi thing...please excuse my mistakes...hmm.... and another thought before wi leave eachother for the night, our blogs will mostlikely vary from mood to mood...this one was quite light...but please stay tuned for the next...who knows what it may contain?...wi like being entertaining....and also..keep in mind all is real. hmm...thats deep....
