      Well, today was not quite a gd day but also not a bad day.. Lol. u ppl might think that i'm crazy or wat. Today actually only got one lesson in the morning, which is CATERING SCIENCE. And after the lesson would be home sweet home. BUt sad to say, as usual, all my classmates came into class at 9am, waiting for the teacher, Mr Alan Tan to come in to mark attendance and carry on with the lesson, but to everyone's suprise, another teacher came in and told the class that Mr Alan Tan took urgent leave and that the class would be cancelled.  U guys must be thinking that we were be very happy to hear that, but NO.. most of the class's face turn black, as they have to travel from the east to school early in the morning, having to wake up at 0530 or later. and in the end find the teacher not in class. Whew, lucky for me, i stayed nearby..   Well, as for the gd part of the day was that i got the cashier job at carrefour and today went over to Suntec to collect my uniform and also took&nbsp;the photo for the staff pass. And would be starting work on monday, lets hope that class would end early on monday, as i dont wish to be late for work on the 1st day.   Well, think that's all for today, shall report farer abt my life tomolo. Tomolo morning still got practical lesson and also i would be working at FISH & CO tomolo too.   Cheer and till then Thomas

      Hi all,   Today was a fruitless but partly fruitful day.. Firstly, today actually only have a lesson in the morning, which is CATERING SCIENCE. Everyone was there waiting in class for the teacher, Mr Alan Tan to come in to class. But at 9am, another teacher came in and told the class that Alan Tan was on urgent leave which means that the lesson is being cancelled.   U guys might think that all of us would be damm happy as there's no class. But NO.. all of them their face turn black. must be wondering y rite. Cause most of them stay in the east and they had to spend on transport and also having to wake up early to rush to school, then turn out to be in class only for half an hour and dismissed..   Whew, lucky for me, i stay nearby, but well, it was really a wasted trip. i could have slept longer or even plan for other programs. Anyway, wat a wasted day.   Bad things aside, nw for the happy part was that i got the job as a cashier at carrefour and would be starting work on monday, hehe. Hope that class would not end late on monday, as i've to reach plaza singapura by 1730.   Well, think that's for today, tomolo still got practical lesson.   Cheers and nite. Thomas

      Hi ppl,   It's been quite a few wks since i last wrote a post.. Sorry huh. Dont know y, just feeling too lazy to write. hehe..   Well, the past wks have been quite smooth going for me, can u imagine, this is already the 4th wk of my course, in 5 wks time, would be the dateline for the projects to be handed up and in 6 wks time, would be the exams.. Time really flies, i just feel that i only started course yesterday. No matter wat, it's the only truth that this is the 4th wk and it's about time i buck up and really study damm hard.   So far, for my course, i've learnt hw to cook soup, make sauces, and today we learnt hw to debone a chicken. u ppl might think that it's easy, but when it comes to real task, sweat keeps dripping, one thing, scare that would cut my hand, lol.. well, just have to be careful. Then we also learnt hw to fillet a sea bass. Finally can learn some real skills. haha.   And nxt wk, we would finally start cooking the main course. haha. after learning the skill, i'm going to put it to test on my friends.. hehe  Well, think that's all for nw, hope i wouldnt be lazy to come online to blog soon..   Cheers Thomas

      Today was a fun day, had practical lessons today, learning hw to make different type of salad dressing, learnt hw to make tatar, mayo, salsa, etc.. Nw then i know hw hard all this sauces are to be made. The process is long and tiring. so the lesson learnt is nv to waste products, even if it's a sauce... Lol.. Just joking.  &nbsp; I love lessons on tues, thurs, and sat. only practical. hehe. then if we do the task fast and everyone gets together to clean up the kitchen fast, then we can call it a day. but today, sad to say, someone in my group nv coperate. Instead of helping to clean up and wait for the teacher to finish inspecting, he left for home,&nbsp;making us clear up his shit.. F***ing bustard. &nbsp;I'm sure he would be rewarded... with demerit points... If not it would be unfair for the rest of us. Normally, my class which is divided into two groups, and i'm in the 1st group would finish and end the lesson earlier than the other, but because of this bustard, today the class end at 1pm, later than the other.  &nbsp; Other than the lesson today, my project group had a gathering today, we discussed abt the project for food, and gathered all the informations abt the topic that we had wanted to do, and found out that it was not easy, so in the end decided to change a different topic, so in the end, all the effort was wasted, but not really, at least we learnt somethings from the 1st topic that we wanted to do. The discussion was quite a short one though, and the nxt meeting was decided to be nxt tues.  &nbsp; Tkink that's all for today, tomolo still got class, and can u imagine, tomolo would be getting the chef uniform too. hehe, finally &nbsp; Cheers Thomas

      Haha. finally back from a tiring day from school. Started at 8 in the morning till 5 in the evening. Boring day today, well, everyday's boring in school. who would like to go to lesson, especially when there's subjects which r damm dry, Like food knowledge, learning all sorts of food, the parts of an animals, etc... Somemore when the teacher is a boring one, who nv jokes.  &nbsp; Early in the morning was IT lesson, today learn abt powerpoint presentation, boring and stupid. Today also got back the proficency test result, and guess wat, out of the whole class, only 5 got 75% pass and i'm one of them.. hehe. U ppl must be thinking y i'm so happy, cause those who got 75% and above would be exempted from the IT lesson and then just need to sit for the end of term exam. But i think some of the lessons i would still sit in, as i'm not stable with my theory.  &nbsp; Followed by IT, was the boring food knowledge lesson, a 3 hr long lesson. Today in this class, learn abt all types of fish; white fish, oily fish, flat fish, rd fish, seawater fish, freshwater fish. sian... But wat to do, it's part of the things a CHEF need to know.  &nbsp; Today's kitchen demo was another theory lesson, as tomolo then the teacher would teach to make the sauces for salad hope that tomolo would be an interesting one. Think that's all for today. Till then. Cheers Thomas

      Yesterday was the SINGAPORE'S 39th birthday, but too bad, i was working last nite at carrefour, and was unable to watch the national day prarade. Then yesterday was also very busy, i thought everyone would be either staying at home or at the national stadium watching the parade. but no.. the whole nite was so busy with long queue. And causing me not being able to have a rest even for a minute.. Sian..  But even though it was a busy nite, the pay was double so it was not bad afterall. Yesterday i was being asked to open counter at level 1 again. The most busy level as it sells all those food stuff. But lucky yesterday manage to close at ard 1020. then after counting all the money, i found out that i was short of $2. sian, have to pay on the spot.  Don't know y also, yesterday was quite an unlucky day for me, it is that i keep dropping money onto the floor, then the whole coin container also drop.  It could be this reason that i lost the $2.  As for today, it is another day of practical lesson, for today's menu, there wasnt any demo as yesterday was a public holiday, the teacher only told us the ingredients and the steps that was to be done on the friday's demo lesson, even though there wasn't any demo shown, most of us still manage to cook the menu wonderfully.. hehe. Tasted the menu myself and found that it was not bad.. haha.. self satistyed..  Think that's all for nw, shall blog again tomolo if have the time.. Cheers Thomas

      Haha. Finally a off day after three days of training as cashier and a day where i opened my own counter which was yesterday.. As usual, reported for work at 1745, found out that yong feng was on off yesterday. So no choice, couldnt get the PLU code that he promised to give us..  Was given a counter at B2, which was mostly all the electrical items, and was asked to open the express counter, which is only for customers who buys less than 10 items.  At the end of the day, when i was asked to close counter and count the money, i was the last to finish counting as got some problem . lets hope that tomolo would not have much problem again, lucky for me that there was no extra or less of cash.  Then today, i had food knowledge test, followed by POC, today we learnt two menu, one for tomolo and the other for tues, as monday is a public holiday so there wouldnt be any class.  Well, think that's all for nw. till then. Cheers Thomas

      Quite a gd day yesterday for me, last day of training as a cashier at Carrefour, later would be opening my own counter, lets hope that everything would go smoothly for me, and also that my counter would not have extra or less money, if not wouldnt be worth working liao..  Yesterday, for POC, learnt hw to cooking stew chicken, mushroom soup, and glaze veg. Hope that later i would be able to cook a nice dish out, hehe. Then yesterday, only got two class for me, one is CATERING SCIENCE, the other was as i said, POC.  Well, even though it was quite a gd day, it was also abit of tiring, from a whole day of standing at the counter. Think that's all for nw, would write again when i come back.  Cheers Thomas
