      About 1:30, on my television, the screen went blank. And an emergency broadcast began for a flash flood warning for Prineville.  Oh, shit , I thought, since Mom was out doing errands and Chris was at work and who the heck knows where Christopher was. The warning was for "1:30-3:30" but nothing happened until  three thirty . I had just gotten out of a shower and dressed up in my lovely black leather boots and courderoy jacket to go out. About thirty seconds later, the sky goes dark. The power goes out. It starts raining. I mean, it starts RAINING. There were torrents coming down, it was so bad I thought maybe our cat had drowned outside. I ventured out in a tank-top, through the backyard and the front yard, looking for a trace sign of Tazz. I yelled. I screamed. I couldn't hear myself yell  or  scream.   I was soaked. You could barely see anything beyond the sheets of water pouring down from the heavens. Mom left my Camry's window down, how stupid, and she went out to roll it up. I myself rescued the Jeep windows.  The power was out for approximately 4 hours. In an attempt to block out this potential scar, I am currently listening to my favorite hard-rock station, full-blast. I think the neighbor's yard is barking in protest.  It wasn't that bad - I mean, I am not a high-maintenance person who needs a hair curler and blow-dryer and T.V. every hour and everything else girly-girls entail, but I really missed my music. And about half way through I got this huge craving to play FF. That sucked. But it was fun...I mostly read National Geographic.  And I just found out it was only our block whose electricity went out. Fux0rz to the company. Damn.

      Have I bitched yet about how much I hate phones? I do. I was trying to get ahold of Chelsea, to ask if she wants to go to a movie tonight. Well, a while ago her family decided to get rid of their landline and switched to having only cell phones. So from previous experience, I know the number in the phone book is “out of order.” She gave me her new numbers but, idiot that I am, I lost them. So I looked up Ashley’s phone number (it’s crazy, I have absolutely none of my friend’s phone numbers written down) but it’s not in any phone book. So I look up Roxie’s number and call her. Answering machine. She never picks up because she has caller ID and my number doesn’t show up, so she thinks it’s a telemarketer. I hate leaving messages, so I don’t. And I call Jayne. She doesn’t have Chelsea’s, but she has Ash’s. So I call the number she gives me – and I get an answering machine that says this is the home of the “Bobs” or something like that. I didn’t catch it, but I was pretty sure it wasn’t “Bernard” he said. So I call Alysia. Doesn’t have Chelsea’s number, but has Ashley’s. Guess what, it’s the same one Jayne gave me! So I call the number back, and it’s busy. I call about four more times until she picks up and gives me Chelsea’s number…  And nobody answers.  I hate phones.  But today’s experience inspired me to look up/find every single one of my friend’s numbers and print them out to hang on my bulletin board. Everyone’s but Dorene’s, Amy’s and Molly’s, because I probably will never need to call them and besides, Amy is staying in Seattle all summer.  Sorry to bore you with this inconsistent crap…but, if you haven’t noticed, my life is made out of inconsistent crap. I wish I was wittier and could make the whole thing a big joke, but I’m afraid it already is (?). My mother forgot to call Aunt Tonia so if we do go to Ashland, it won’t be for another few days. Too bad…I need my tri-monthly dose of Crazy Marilyn. Heh.

      It's eight though, two more hours to go until, er, go-time. Yep. The other night I spent outside, looking at stars with my binoculars and book and flashlight. I need a red-light pen, though, to help my eyes adjust so I can see the stars better.  So I saw Vega (easiest star to spot lately...), Draco (Drako? whatever.), and all the easy-amateur ones. Quite beautiful, its been so clear lately.  For *some* reason, I have been thinking a lot on what Ashley said, and I realize it's never gonna happen. As much as I love Zach, it can't be more than a friendship (and he knows it, too). Even if she thinks we should be together. Hah. I hope he's having fun working at the golf course, with the sanitation problem they've been having (you can smell it from the library).  Ok, so, my brother's trial is tomorrow. Hopefully he does well, and they dismiss it, but I doubt they will. Stupid ass. How he could get caught with that thing in his hand, when he says he didn't make it...what a loser. Also, his lawyer makes $200 an hour, which is big money around here for a lawyer (she's the best in the area).  Who else is totally disgusted by the fact that Colin Farrel is a father? Poor children. Feel worst for them than I do Michael Jackson's kids...

      She still won't reply to me, which pisses me off. But I guess if she continues to ignore me, I can just kiss her ass goodbye, which might be a relief. Plus, Zach is on vacation, so he hasn't e-mailed me lately. I miss him immensely.  It's hard to find good people online that you can talk to. I certainly haven't in years, if you don't count Dane, who isn't fun to talk to anyways, and I just put up with him because we go to the same school.  So I want to make some "new friends" to chat with, because I'm pretty lonely when I'm online now. I mean,  She  is gone, perhaps forever, and all of my old best online friends are never on any more.

      Just got finished painting the cabinet doors in the new garage. 19 doors...10 cabinets. The first coat was white primer and the second coat was semi-gloss black (I shall have to do a second coat of the black :X). They are pretty, pretty pretty.  I haven't written anything in Bullfrog for a long time (well, a few weeks, possibly), which is a bad thing. A very  bad  thing. To keep up with my schedule, I must write approximately three pages a day. Not gonna happen, sadly.  I really should get together with Chelsea this weekend. I mean, my family will be going away soon. Possibly Ashland this Tuesday, and Seattle (with my friends, not family) in the middle of August, and Berkeley (with possibly mom and Mary) the first week of August. Lots of traveling...and that doesn't even allude to the possibility of our annual coast vacation, which we may yet go on. Who knows what the future holds?  I don't, Mr. Spock.

      I have joined the Blogger community...I used to have a blurty but...yes, long story. Hah.  So a bit about myself -  I love history. I'm 17 years old, going to be a high school senior next fall. When I go to college, I'm going to major in history / political science. I love reading, writing, playing video games, going to the theater, soccer, swimming, blahblah...flamingoes. I do love flamingoes.  So, I am off to find some decent people on this site (I certainly hope you people aren't as wonderfully dull as the people at Blurty, especially the ones who are on happy drugs and have three kids and are 16).

       Reminds me of childhood memories...  I don't care what anyone says; the Guns N' Roses version is by far the best. Sheryl Crow's is the only decent cover out there, but it falls short of the original. I love this song, Sweet Child O' Mine.  Anyway...just checking in so you know I'm alive and all :D  Work sucked. My boss hates me, I swear. I hate the manager, but at least Val is NICE to me. Beth, the owner, really isn't that cordial to me. When she sees me she never says "Hi" or "How's it going?" or anything decent, like a normal grownup (you know, those questions that you hate but once they leave you miss...). She made me re-do a ton of things in the rooms, MOSTLY stuff that the other worker did. She's new, and didn't put any coffee cups in  any  of the rooms. And she didn't wash a couple of fridges...and etc...but I had to do it. The stuff I forgot was only in about three rooms, and it was always the soap dish. I'M NOT EVEN AS TALL AS THE DAMN SOAP DISHES, how the fuck am I supposed to see over them to check if they're dirty? Beth has an advantage, she's like 5'8" or so. I'm a measly 5'4". I'm totally serious...I cannot see over the soap dishes. Why anyone crafted the soap dishes so high, I shall never know. What if a kid taking a shower reaches up to grab the soap and can barely reach it and he smacks it accidentally and it flies in the shower and lands on the floor and he steps on it and breaks his back? I'd like to see the soap dish construction worker then.  I'm scheduled for ten days next month! The only advantage is that I get all the vacation time I need to go to Berk and Seattle, possibly even Ashland (a five day trip to each would be very easy to schedule). But that's approximately 25 hours next month, which is ten hours less than I have worked in the past  two weeks . It's obvious that they think I'm a crap worker.  Pretty ironic since the new girl is scheduled almost every day, is slower than I am, and made a ton of mistakes I was blamed for. I like her though. But they shouldn't treat her any different than me just because this is my first paying job (I've worked about ten volunteer jobs over the past five years) and she's worked at, wh00t-de-doo, Best Western and a couple of golf courses cleaning.  But I don't mean to sound bitter :) Oh yea - changed the layout in a vain attempt to make my own. Sucks. I can't work with this system - I had it all figured out with the other journal. Arg. Well, it made my linkies disappear. I shall have them up soon, when I get it in my head not to be so lazy any more...  Well, off to the fair! Should be great fun.

       I feel like a bum...a rushed, working bum. I can't muster the energy to exersize and I'm at a loss on my assignments. Work is horrid, relationships suck, and hole generated by the calories I burn at my job is immediately filled when I indulge myself in a three-dollar heath icerage afterwards. I need to call Ash but I'm on the depths of despair. I'm at the beginning of a long mood swing, a great bout of depression I haven't experienced in over seven months. I've had almost-longings of old friends, but thankfully haven't sunk so low to try to rekindle anything. Aloof and astute, that's me...or is it?    I HATE my depression. It comes at me in a rush, taking me by surprise (although in my subconscious I know it is inevitable) and leading me to a special hell reserved for my mind and body. A constant loathing of one's self, bitter hatred concerning one's body, occasional suicidal thoughts (none so far, this time) and a nightmarish feeling that every person is criticizing me all the time. This happens way too much. I hate it. I don't know if any words I give allusion to can represent these feelings as accurate as I would like. I read recently an article about silver amalgam tooth fillings consisting of half-mercury, a horribly dangerous neurotoxin, which leak mercury into your bloodstream and consequently your brain all the time (look it up if you don't believe me). 90% of people, after getting their silver fillings removed, never experienced depression again. I wonder if that's the kind of fillings I have...they certainly are all silver.     And like I said earlier...I don't have any clue about my newest assignment. The questions are hard. I can't comprehend them. They can mean any of three things to me at times. I wish they were easier to understand. Such as, "What are contemporary activities and influences from Greece that overlapped the early developments in Italy?" What the hell does that mean?    God this entry is dark. Just ignore it, okay? It's total crap things coming out of my brain from somewhere-I-don't-know-where.

       The first is from Carrie Fisher, who, if you did not know, plays Princess Leia in the old-school kick-ass Star Wars (AND SHAME YOU IF YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT). The other two are from classical Greek philosophers. Oh, and the last one is from one of the best books I've ever read (and at seventeen dollars, it had better be) - The Book of Lists, the section regarding spam. &nbsp;    "I love what speed and coke do to my weight. It's unnatural, I know. I could just exercise..."    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Carrie Fisher     &nbsp;   "All is water."    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-Thales    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Greek philosopher, 624-546 B.C.E.)     &nbsp;   "All is air."    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Anaximenes    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Greek philosopher, d. 545 B.C.E.)     &nbsp;    Subject:  "Your credit card has been charged for $234.65"     Message:  "Important Notice:     &nbsp;   We have just charged your credit card for money laundry service in the amount of $234.65 (because you are either child pornography webmaster or deal with dirty money, which require us to laundry them and then send to your checking account).

       I saw Dorene today at Papa Murphy's. Very nice, almost everyone went to the rodeo. Together. Without me. That's nice. Probably invited Chelsea but she had to work or something. Yep. Great. Not even a damn phone call. Mmhmm. My best friends and I don't even get an invite =] supremely wonderful. I don't understand it. Not that I would have wanted to even go to a stupid rodeo, but it would have been nice if someone had called me. Everyone except Chelsea and I went. And like I said before, Chelsea was probably asked to go.     &nbsp;  I'm always the last person to know everything, if I even do get talked to about something. Fucking hell, I wasn't even invited to Jayne's party in my sophomore year...guess she ran out of room or something. Some fucking thing. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL. We're all fucking best friends and we love each other to death (some more than others; I probably hang out with Amanda, Chelsea, Roxanne and Ash more than the rest) but...I feel left out a lot. I wish Amanda was here. I wish she was back. Fuck. I miss her more than I miss Bobert, and Bobert is the best friend I have ever had in my life. I FUCKING MISS HER.    &nbsp;  Dorene talked about the Seattle trip too. If we're going, I have to know before the 25th so I can get time off. But yea, if they do go - I probably won't find out about it either, or be invited =] how nice.    &nbsp;  Ok. Enough depressed shit talk. And sorry I'm cussing so much. ^^ I need to stop. I can emphasize things much better with other vocabulary words. Eh. Anyways...baseball rocks. Props to the players out there.

      Heyy, new editing system! Fun stuff. I am typing in "font."  Now I am typing in "Trebuchet."   Ok now Verdana. The prized favorite.     &nbsp;  Well, I have realized that the Good Kid gets allowed a few Bad Things without being held accountable. I.e. Me kicking a hole through Christopher's door. I was angry, blah. And best yet - HE got in trouble for it, not me. Heh. Am the Untouchable Flamingo of Lime Convertibles.    &nbsp;  I got a job too :D guess who is working there...Diana! I haven't seen her since I was a likkle freshman. Bwah. She roxurz...her parents own the hotel. The manager is a little freaky but altogether nice. I folded some stuff and got paid for an hour's work 'cause I stayed after she hired me so she could show me around and do laundry. Mmhmm. $7.05 is mine!     &nbsp;  Let's see, what else did I do...scoffed in horror and delight when my brother told me Michael mentioned me in his letter. I am so upset I missed talking to him before he left. My fondest memories will be of when we had Zoology &amp; Marine Bio together, and when we went to the movies, and when he came over and played Yoshi's Island on my GBA.    &nbsp;  Wherever you are now, Michael (presumably somewhere in Poland)...I will never forget you, and will cherish (so corny, but true) our times together. You are the nicest person I have ever met in my life, even if you do drink beer. In Poland.

      Must be either a) bug bites or b) Syntax's ravages on my precious foot skin. 'Cause it is all red and itchy, and kind of bumpy. And bloody, from when the ravaging occured.  Sooo...in an effort to talk about something actually interesting, we went to the horse races tonight! Quite a show, we only stayed for half but still saw four races. Very, very interesting. The jockeys were akin to small chairs with two legs, supremely teeny. Jayne would make a good jockey, except I think she is over the height limit, being 5'0". I think the height limit is around 4'8"?   The carnival was also going on around the fairgrounds (might pop over tomorrow to eat fattening goods and obsess about how stupid the rides are). I SAW KRISTINA! Ohhh, that made my week. She hasn't written me yet, said she can't find my address, it being trapped behind some picture frame she can't remember (forgot to tell her it might be behind the picture of her catdog she brought to camp). Oh, she is so sweet. I missed her tremendously. She is very bright for her age, no wonder I took to her the most at camp. She was my favorite :D I wonder if she has seen Jenny around. I couldn't stick around to chat as the old family was waiting to pile into the car and go home, but it was so nice to see her. Bwah.  Latest school assignment is regarding China in antiquity and medieval Japan. It spoke a lot of Samurai and how they came about, I thought that was very interesting. Did you know that homosexuality among the Samurai was very common? Intriguing. Very loyal men, were those Samurai.

             Mmm, I am  Lemon  Flavoured.   I am bitter and twisted. Expect from me acerbic humour and sharp commentary. While I may seem nasty at first, I'm actually quite good company if I like you, so long as you don't mind a bit of cutting to the chase.  What Flavour Are You?              The haxor handle of  Sublime  is " Sh@rp&nbsp;Overrid3 ".      What's yours? Enter your name:

      Last night was tres bonne! I forgot to write about it this morning, eh? We went to see The Terminal, which was very good, but I found some parts a little long (although, in retrospect, they weren’t long  or  boring; I just had to pee really badly at the time and my kidneys hurt). Some aspects were quite amusing, and Spielberg certainly played to his abilities, but it wasn’t a new masterpiece of his. However, I highly recommend this movie as Hanks and Spielberg are an incredible team, no matter what the premise.  After the movie, it was 9:45, and the closest fast food place – Arby’s – was just closing as we drove by (I preformed an illegal U-turn in order to discover IT WAS CLOSED, what a waste of a useful spy move) and all hope seemed lost…until, nearly out of Bend, we discovered a vastly unknown Taco Time sitting in a little-known strip mall. The brazen lights just barely grazed my eye line as I realized that no more innocents need to turn to dark, sordid McDonald’s Adult Happy Meals at 10:30 p.m., as Taco Time is open until “1:00 a.m. Or Later.” Two complaints only: Pepsi products. Who the hell wants to drink Pepsi products, and if you’re going to have  only  Pepsi shit in your “restaurant” at least stock DR. PEPPER, the only good Pepsi product. My other complaint is regarding their “Cinnamon Twists,” which are in reality stale styrofoam corkscrews of pale taste and no flavor.

      I am supremely glad she doesn't know this journal exists. Her knowledge is of my old journal, the one I haven't updated in weeks. And never will again. The old is so...constricted. I feel I have more freedom to write in this blog. I just gave up writing in that old one; I couldn't think of anything more to say. Not much you can say after 2000 posts, eh?  Anyway, she said to forget it, that she is "mostly" over it. Well, whatever. I'm never signing on to my old screennames again, and even when she finally does stop "ignoring" me by not using the SNs I know about, I doubt I'll give her my new screenname. And she won't know about this journal.  Ever feel like you hate someone, but in moments of glory you realize you love them?  I have decided to make a layout for this thing. I love CSS...fun stuff. Thinking pink, lime green, flamingo-ish? With a margarita. Hell yea.

      The other night my computer flipped out. It went completely haywire. It's hard to explain...basically there was an error message every five seconds, the color scheme / resolution was all screwed up, nothing would open. So the next morning we took it into the computer place, and I got it back tonight. He installed XP on there instead of ME, which is great because I have wanted to do it for forever. He installed a new drive, also. Apparently my computer had over 150 viruses on it. Yikes.  So it's back and better than ever :D

       Okay, this is pissin' me off. The photo site still, obviously, says that my daily allowance has been used up of bandwidth. Arg. HAS NOT! I'm looking into getting a new photo hosting site and probably using many of them so that I never go over my bandwidth on one.      I watched Connie and Carla the movie last night. It was somewhat funny, but pretty amusing (well, it kept me amused for an hour and forty minutes, approx.). If you have nothing better to rent, then rent it, but if there's another movie you want to see don't bother.      Also, APPARENTLY, by September 1st $500 must be into my France account. It's my graduation present and yet I'm supposed to pay for it. Thanks, mom and dad. You're the GREATEST. SAID WITH SEVERE SARCASM.

       They constantly demean me because I have certain self-confidence. Certain meaning in specific areas, and none in other areas. For instance, I know I'm right most of the time. Why? Because I have a photographic memory. I can walk into a store and just be walking around, not looking for anything in particular, and a week later my mother can ask me how much milk is at the store and I know how much it is. I read an obscene amount (amassing huge collections of random facts that dazzle people who will listen) and I use my large vocabulary when talking. Yea, I'm arrogant, and I know it. I'm fucking narcissistic and I know that, too. I don't really give a shit.      It's just when my family degrades me and says things like "go stand in your closet and stay there" or "who cares, you live in fantasy land all the time anyway" that upset me. I don't understand it at all. I'm so cynical of the world, the only way I can survive is to read and  live in my fantasy world . The real world disgusts me so much that if I didn't have my own domain (my room, where I read and write and  live ) I would have gone through with the suicide attempts a long time ago. Like in the fifth grade when I first tried and almost succeeded to OD on random pills.      They disgust me so much. They gang up on me and I don't have a clue why. What the fuck, you would think they would be used to my ugliness and conceitedness. It especially upsets me when my stepfather makes jeering comments or sounds ("oink oink") when I'm looking for something to eat or am doing  nothing . Except usually when I'm out of my room someone will usually tell me to go back to my cave.       Oh, I have gone into this too long. I really hate to post depressed writing in here. They were just doing it all again and I am upset. I just went there to talk and play with my cat, but no. It turns into a ganging up on me once again, with my brother making lewd comments and doing imitations of me, and my stepfather doing much of the aforementioned.      But why I really wanted to post, before I got caught up in all that, is that I've implimented something new into my blog. On the sidebar I'm adding something. By January 1st, 2005, I want to have jogged 250 miles. Yes. There are 137 days remaining this year, and that averages 1.83 miles per day. Not a lot for a person in shape, which is why after January 1st I want to start running more. The 250 miles is just to get me in shape and geared for the Big Year. The Year of Graduation and All. Sooo...I'm making an image I'll update every Sunday night or so, with numbers of miles to run left, along with miles ran so far and days left to achieve this.      So thanks all, for being supportive of me. I hope you will all still be supportive during this time too, because I'll need a lot of willpower to do this. I usually get into shape and then quit running, get out of shape, and then repeat the whole thing again. This time I'm trying to stay in shape permanently.       On another note somewhat related, I really enjoy reading everyone's comments. I know I'm not interesting a lot of the time but it means a lot that I can count on you all. You're all great people and thanks for putting up with me.

       So Uncle James and my new Aunt Pam left. They were here for a few days :) James is a millionaire. He owns a concrete company and is an artist too. He made me some opal earrings when I was a little kid, they are so gorgeous. He has land down in Mazatlan and I wanted to go there for spring break but we went to Ashland instead. Ha-ha.      Anyway, that's about the extent of what I have to write about. I hung around the house while Mom took Christopher to Mitchell to look at the private school there. If he's accepted he'll only be home on the weekends :D oh that would be great. Our relationship would be about 10x better, that's for sure. Almost like I've gone off to college. Soooo...I hate my family though. They're a bunch of pissy bitches. Fucking hell.      I have dentist tomorrow. I'm scared. I hate the dentist.

       I'm going over to Chelsea's at six. It's David's birthday and there's going to be pizza and a lot of 15-year-old boys. HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAVID! David's great. I taught him how to play chess and we've bounced on trampolines together.  Maybe I'll go to a movie later. The Village? Chels said it was good. Not scary, but suspenseful (which is what I have heard from   urlLink  other people    too).

       Firstly, I did say I was going to write something new for Civilitas since I haven't lately, as I've been on vacation and...other stuff. But the point is I can't until tomorrow or Saturday. Why? Because I've spent the past five hours doing homework for my college History of World Civilizations class. And that's just my WEEK'S ASSIGNMENT. My class ends on Saturday and I have a final to do as well (an essay). I've left two days open to work on this, tomorrow and Saturday. I am swamped, to be frank.      In other news...she finally figured it out. That I hate soccer. She knocked on my door and said "You have a message from Kambak. She says if you're playing soccer, you have to call her back." Uh. So I told her very politely that no way in hell am I playing soccer; I have thought about it and decided that I am going to be very busy my senior year of high school, what with a job and my senior project and taking additional college classes, and helping run Student Bank and other such nonsense.      So she said Okay. She didn't ask me to explain or anything because she knows and  gets it now .      What else...oh yes. Added a few things to sidebar. The thing near the bottom of it is a random link to a journal through a program called BlogSnob. I can't figure out how to make the font smaller; I tried everything I could but it didn't work. Well, it worked but it just did something really weird and I had to change it back. I know people can format that thing, I saw it on other blogs, but I can't figure it out. Any suggestions?      And I put a counter at the bottom of my journal. I wanted it on the side bar but for some reason when I put it there, it drags down to the bottom of my journal and won't go where I want it. I figure there's some sort of footer code in it I can't figure out. I'm just used to java and perl :( Eh. Well, BLAH. Oh yes - and I put in a little Simpsons random quote thing. It's hilarious, well, most of them anyway.       Also, I am very depressed for a reason I'd rather not divulge. Fuck it all.

      First of all, sorry for not doing to Civilitas article. I was mucho busy yesterday :X homework and such. Plus it didn't help that my brother was online all evening.     Syntax Error. Leaving the build...blinds. (Had to take out!)                    My favorite David Bowie picture.

       I have eight pictures to post, so I'll disperse them and post a few every once in a while (every few hours? days? Whatever)          This one I call Face/Off. Tazz, big cat, is on the left. Syntax Error, little kitten, is on the right. Syntax often pesters big cat and Tazz absolutely hates her. Hiss!              That's my brother. In his homemade garbage bag diaper. He was filling it with water and running around in the yard. For kicks, I guess. What a freak.

         urlLink Grant     brought this up...it's funny 'cause it's true. Those little banners above our philosophical blogs are keyword activated. On Civilitas, it advertises for Iraqi Dinars (CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT AN IRAQI DINAR IS??), although I'm pretty sure I haven't typed the word Iraq or Iraqi in there. Maybe it thinks..."Bush. What goes with Bush automatically? IRAQ!"  So let's just see about the journals I go to, hmm? All right.    urlLink  Ryan   , he protests against the movie because it sucks in comparison to the book, has an ad for "I-Robot" movie wallpaper, etc. Plus an ad for the book. Which he already owns. So ppshaw. And   urlLink  Urza's    blog has ads for a "simple depression cure" and "gothic poetry." I don't know if you're depressed or what, Urza, but it really doesn't seem like you are. And from what I understand, you are DEFINITELY not Gothic. Er.  One of my other blogger friends,   urlLink  Lor   , found a clever way to block the ads. I had one of those on my old journals, they rock but are hard to place. Too bad I don't get to find what she gets ads for :) foot fungus? Machine guns? THE WORLD WILL NEVER KNOW! :D  And   urlLink  Catfish     has an ad for protecting marine life in the Georgian straight. Might this have something to do with his second post, the Penguin Quiz he took? I guess they had to do that, or use an ad for urinals, as his first post calls blogs the urine of the internet. Like I told him last night, very vulgarly I might add, "everyone must urinate :)"  Thanks again Grant for pointing the ads out...I'm selectively blind and tend to ignore a lot of detail. ^_^

       I drove past Rawhide today and Zach's truck wasn't at his house. He must have been at Meadow Lakes. I almost stopped there but I didn't.  We talked on the phone for three hours the day before I left. We were supposed to go out with Gates one day but we haven't yet. I doubt we will, although we promised each other. Save that for the school year, I guess. Random plans when we go out to lunch together. And no more Subway.  My favorite memory is when we were driving home after seeing 13 Going on 30 (cute, but not great) and he was singing along with the radio. The Reason, as I recall.  And the pro/con list isn't going too well. All I can think of is Reed is Small and Berk is Big.

       Yes, I am back. HOME. I love HOME. HOME IS WHERE THERE ARE NO TAXES. HOME IS WHERE I DON'T HAVE TO PUMP MY OWN GAS.  California is expensive. They tax food, clothes, gas, income...parking...anything they can. And where do their taxes go? IT'S A DAMN MYSTERY. Because their interstate system is run-down, you have to pay for everything (WTF? Since when does PARKING A CAR need to be paid for? IT'S NOT LIKE I'M DAMAGING THE FUCKING CURB! There is no rehabilitation needed! Why do they make you pay to park a car???) and then some...it's so sad. Here in Oregon we are one of the few states without an income AND sales tax. We can buy our damn .99 cent sodas and not worry about having to dig out an extra 7-8 cents for TAX. And we can buy our $20,000 Camrys and not pay $2000 in TAX. It's the OREGON WAY. Plus we have legal abortion, euthanasia, and gas-pumpers. YEA! GAS PUMPERS! I DON'T HAVE TO PUMP MY OWN GAS HERE! I CAN JUST SIT ON MY FAT, LAZY ASS AND NOT WORRY ABOUT IT!  I love Oregon. It's the place to be. And this trip made me realize it. Oregon's an untapped treasure trove of liberal politics mixed with small town America.  And I absolutely adore Berkeley. Four years there would be fine for me...as long as I didn't have to drive a car. Because parking is unseemly down there - I'd rather take PT and deal with the filth than the traffic + parking fees. Although...the shopping is nice - very original - but Ashland and Portland are better for it. And cheaper. Plus there's Reed...I have to decide whether I want....well, let's make a list. Pro/con for each school.  Shall post it later. After I make it. And Grant, thanks very much :D apparently Blogger sends you an e-mail asking you to join the blog. So I'll get on that right away. Soon. Maybe tomorrow morning. 'Cause my eyes burn.  Tomorrow...more political rants in Civilitas. Probably...the immigrant/president issue. That's going to be a hotspot in the future.

       We're off to Berkeley in the morning! Shall be gone a minimum of four days. If I don't find a suitable internet cafe (scoff, cough and more scoffing) then a detailed entry will be on the order when I get back.  Ack. Hotels cost too much there. Here, in this stupid town (and in most of Oregon) the prices per room for a single are around $29-35. The cheapest hotel ("Berkeley Budget Inn") was about $63/night. And the prices increased exponentially from that; think Hotel 6 costing $200+ a night. Wow. That's my last paycheck - I worked for  two weeks .  And, luckily, I still have most of it (actually it was $256 but after taxes...so sad) and can spend it on crap in San Francisco. Who would have thought, MY stepdad taking me down there. He's practically the most racist guy I know. Although I think it's all for show...  We leave in the morning at 7:00 a.m. Brilliant. I will wake up at 5:30, quick shower, and finish packing (contacts, hair brush, shampoo, razor, hair stuff, etc). So...bye! Til some day a few days from now. Wheeee.

       I made a separate political discussion journal :)  urlLink http://civilitas.blogspot.com/      I'm going to post a bit from my first post there, so you can kind of get an idea of what it's about, etc.  "I created this journal because I feel that my personal journal should not be muddied with my opinions on politics. Why just politics? Because it's my premier passion, and everyone has a right to decide what they believe in, and should not have to read my writings about my political opinions unless they choose to. By choosing to read this journal, you are choosing to read my (and hopefully in the future, other's) political views and opinions.  Hopefully I will not incorporate any personal evaluations into this journal; my personal life is on the stand at my other journal, Sublime. This one is strictly politics.  I encourage all of you who regularly read my journal (all four or five of you - Lor, Ryan, Urza, Lotos maybe, and even the people I have recently met - Grant and DeAnn) to talk to me about joining this journal so it can, hopefully, become a place where different people can post their own opinions - instead of constantly reading about my own :)"  Okay, so that's most of the first post. But you get the gist, hopefully.

       Fahrenheit 9/11 is now officially banned from Kuwait. In the words of the emphatical Michael Moore..."I'm sure glad we were able to liberate Kuwait and make it a free country!"  I've decided that for a girl who will major in politics...I rarely talk about politics in my blog. Perhaps I'll make a special one just for politics :) Then anyone who wants to read about my views, etc, which I will try to make unsolicitating, can.  Just so you know...I have NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER EVER ^ 25th power wanted either Bush or Kerry to win the election. I've never been Pro-Bush, Anti-Kerry, Anti-Bush or Pro-Kerry. Never. Until yesterday. But still, I hate advocating my opinion to the masses when I believe everyone is free to make up their own mind, and I HATE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSTANTLY DERAILING THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEIR PARTY IS TOTALLY, AND CONSTANTLY "RIGHT" AND ONLY THEIR POLITICAL CANDIDATE IS WORTHY OF ANY VOTES FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

       In my old one, I had 1,725 entries.  I started by going through the ones from the first day I got my journal - April 19, 2003. It's amazing how much you can change in sixteen months. I read through surveys I filled out, with answers I would never write in now, through my thing with Brian to the Labyrinth community to...growing closer to my best friend. I wrote about my brother's rotten actions, meeting Patrick, and the time when Amanda almost died and I spent the night crying. I told readers about the concerts, the parties, the friends...about Derek's hurtful comments, more job interviews, karaoke at Alysia's which led to the Allmighty Water Fight between us and the guys.  I talked about Adrian, whom Bobert was deathly jealous of. Wrote of watching Insomniac Music Theater on VH1 until the wee hours of the morning. Watching the stars and clouds float by with a light zephyr tickling my nose while on the cement of our newly started second garage. And my insomniac issues last year...and all of the games I played with other people on AIM. Hey, they deserved it. I started writing less and less as my junior year flied by...  And finally, near the time when I stopped writing...one of the last things I wrote about was my friendship with Zach and how we grew closer and closer, and started to love each other.  I can tell you that Bobert did not like that.

       I want to post a chapter of a book I'm in the middle of writing, but I don't know if I should. The plot line is crazy - I came up with it as a play first, but decided not to write it as a play, instead as a story. Blah-blah-blah. I just wanted to use some clever wordplay and make it a work steeped in sarcasm and nearly-impossible story lines.       But whatever :)

       It's the first time I know of since near the beginning of June (after school got out). He hasn't e-mailed me since then either, although we both promised each other to do so. I know he went on vacation and to golf camps and crap, but still :X he should get on more often. If he doesn't email me by the time he gets off, I'm going to  kick his ass . Hahaha.  Yesterday, walking along at the fair, Ashley asked me if I was going to go to Winter Formal and Prom next year. Uh, no, I told her. She asked me, "But what if Zach asks you?" I told her that was ridiculous and why would he ask me? "Because you guys are friends." Yea, but we are both friends with  other people  too, my world does not just consist of him. Yea, we do a ton of things together (during the school year) like movies, dinner, concerts, but that's different. We're not dating or in love with each other. We love each other, but as friends, of course. I'm just afraid my friends have gotten the wrong impression. Half of them have told me that me and him should get together, but it's just a friendship. FRIENDS.  I've gone on about this for too long :P anyways, to wrap up, am pissed off he hasn't emailed me lately, I'll probably call him later, and I'm glad he's not dead. But still pissed.
