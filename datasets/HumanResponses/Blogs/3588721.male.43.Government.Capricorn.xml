      It's amazing that people, in my life, constantly come to me to find out the latest and greatest about PC Gaming and PC Hardware/Software, and yet I've waited this long to Blog, would you trust me knowing this?  As Blogs are meant to be "my take" on life, the web, the world, etc., I promise not to bore you all with recounting my last 43 years.  Suffice it to say up until this point I've found the path that I was to be on, yet now, after having some major neurosurgery to correct  urlLink Arnold-Chiari Malformation Type I , I feel lost.  Where should I be headed, what should I be doing, should I continue to say, "I'm still recovering?"  Come along on the search, who knows, maybe we can find a path for each of you reading this, one thing for sure, I'm going to be trying to find my new path.

      That's right everyone, I've done it, I'm finally back to work.  After fighting through recover for my  urlLink ACM  surgery, and watching the best friend and person I've ever known die slowly from  urlLink Lung Cancer , I've finally returned to  urlLink work !  I have caught up on just about everything, with the exception of this new Microwave Connection we have at the Police Station.  It's a great idea to have a 45MB Pipe between the PD and their Application Server to run some specialized software; it's a bad idea to drop in an ethernet bridge without providing anyone any information on how or where it needs to be hooked into the network.  This is the level of service I get to deal with on a daily basis.  When I phone and ask about the situation, their reply was simple, "I left an ethernet connection for you".  I suppose I might have missed the announcement from  urlLink Cisco  explaining that their routers/switches/etc now run on a simple english rule set.  I guess I should just log into my router and tell it, "There is the ethernet connection for the application server the police department is using".  I have already begun wondering why I returned.

      OK, so I promised to stay on top of this blog and what did I do?  Nothing, that's about normal for me these days.  Although, I feel things are starting to turn around personally at least.  My back pain is all but gone, yet the pain of watching my Father die is still as ever present as it was before.  Father is back in the VA this week getting Chemo, I really admire how well he's faced this challenge.  I'm not sure I could have been so brave or as level headed as he's been since the day he was diagnosed.  If I can be just 1/10th of my Father, I know I'll be a good man.  So, not much else going on in my world.  I am still getting used to being back at work, and seem to finally have my body trained again to get up in the early hours of the morning and go into work.  One thing about my job, working the 6:00AM to 3:00PM shift (or 2PM without lunch) is really pretty nice.  No traffic coming or going, and I get almost 2 hours alone in the office; I still enjoy that quiet time without people around.  Well, that's about it for now, I "promise" I'll stay on top of this from now on, just like I did before.
