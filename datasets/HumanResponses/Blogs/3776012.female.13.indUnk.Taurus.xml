      All i ever wanted was to be a part of your heart, And for us to be together, never apart  No one else in the world can even compare, You're perfect and so is this love that we share.  We have so much more than I ever thought we would, I love you more than I ever thought I could.  I promise to give you all I have to give, I'll do anything for you as long as I live.  In your eyes I see our present, our future and past, By the way you look at me I know we will last.  I hope that one day you'll come to realize, How perfect you are when seen through my eyes.  - Ashley Borden -  Don't u just luv that poem?  I do...i dunno if i can relate to that YET but newayz...post ur comments on it if u want.  Have fun!

      Love easily breaks A heart once whole, Love easily takes A happy soul  And once it rips my heart apart Sewing of stitches gingerly start To heal a scarred and roughed up heart So tattered and torn by every thorn And finally when the day is done And when the moon has hid the sun I toss and turn within my bed The voices echo in my head  I see his face surrounding me "Stop haunting me!" I scream and pleed He shakes his and sneers at me "Not til you say the magic please!" I say a please; he laughs coldly "I'll never leave!" he taunts at me So then I punch his pretty face I look at his ruins with distaste I spit and say, "You were such a waste."  Then dawn breaks thru the silent dark A cheerful song brought by a lark I wake up very drowsily And make my bed so groggily The sun sheds light into my day A smile slowly plays across my face I sigh with relief and throw my arms out An angel holds me and with no doubts He takes me to a better place  where smiles are always on my face   >brokengurl13 >  I made that one up last nite and it took me from 9 - 11pm to come up w/this..but i think its pretty good.  well plz post ur comments!
