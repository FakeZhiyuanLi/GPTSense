      Ups and Downs about colleges I'm thinking about:  Winthrop -Has a good music and education background -I can come home when I want because it isn't too far -I know people -Not huge like other colleges  UNCW -Has more activities -More course offerings -Has music and education  UNCG -the most course offereings -great music, film, and interior decorating -closer than UNCW  ASU -marching band -pretty -music, education, etc.    ok, this didn't get me anywhere.

      I was really sad and depressed yesterday as most of you know, but then today happened. I was actually really happy today. And i realized that I don't have to be friends with everyone or care if everyone likes me because I have people like Melissa, Lauren, Nathan, Dave... and in a year I'll be somewhere new making more friends. I can't keep worrying about pissing people off because no matter what you do people are going to find some reason to get mad.  I saw a sneak preview of vintage 3 today. another winner!

      No matter what it is... boys, romanca, or a hurt ankle, people are going to say something bad about you. I get so frustrated with everyone sometimes.  And I'm fat.  I'm thinking about ASU for college. I'm also thinking about majoring in music, but I get so tired of music sometimes that I can't decide.   I think that if it weren't for Carrie, I would have a lot of negative feelings right now about everything going on.

      dear chris,   please stop calling me. i do not like you. you are extremely annoying and bothersome and i don't want to go out with you ever ever ever.   Ok, so he calls me when he's supposed to be at the beach for the week, and says he came home for a dentist appointment? please. and he just so happened to have asked me to go out with him then. i wish he would just go away.

      Man, work has just put me in an awful mood. Everyone pisses me off so much. So listen, when going to Food Lion, get stuff you WANT. It isn't easy to void every other item, and it isn't fun to put those items you don't want back. Secondly, if you're going to use your debit card, you have to have money in your freakin' account. I don't like wasting my time scanning all your stupid items to find out you can't pay for them. Third, if you take your sweet time putting things on the rolling belt, it takes longer for me to scan them, meaning my items per minute goes way down. I could go won and on. Now it's time to talk about the stupid managers. There is a mandatory meeting for all employees Wensday from 7 to 9. I gave them my schedule for band a week ago, and they are still making me go. I mean I can't ask to miss band. That's stupid. And the one guy manager there is a complete jerk who won't get off my case. I really need a new job, I can't work around these people anymore. ughghhhhasl;kfjaslk. =( =( =(

      For lunch today, Kris, Robbie, Nathan, AJ and myself went to a sub place. It was okay, but the ride was more interesting. Nathan literally gave me zero room in the back seat, squirted tea at me through his straw, and they threw my bag of chips out my window and ran over them in Kristinas car. I have mean friends. =)  Dave and I were going to Taco Bell for dinner, and we saw Herny! I was quite excited because he's such a hilarious person.   Band camp always puts me in a better mood because I miss not seeing these people as much in the summer. I can't believe I won't be doing this next year. =(

      I have a big annoyance in right now but can't say anything because I'll be said to be complaining. I hope it goes away.   On a birghter note, I got a 4 on my AP Stats exam bia. That's right, college credit for Stats. Fsh!  My feet hurt a lot.

      Today was good. The staff went to Melissa's for a pool party. What a great time. And um, we had pizza. Oh yeah, I let Dave drive my car after practice too hehe. He isn't bad. But you know who is bad? NATHAN! I wish he would take that stick out of his butt. I really like our music this year, it's just hard for me to get high notes. But yesterday I went with Carrie to her old flute lesson teacher and gosh, she helped a lot. They are so much alike and it's so funny, because if you know Carrie you know how much fun she is. And on the way there, since it was about 40 minutes away, we talked about everything. It was awesome.   I find myself to be really lucky lately. =)

      Why do I always have to be upset about something? I don't understand it.&nbsp;I just need one thing that won't leave me so I can have some since of security. But it seems like everything that means the most to me leaves. Everything. And no matter what, I feel like I can never do enough. There's so many obstacles that keep every one of my relationships with people at an awkward standstill. Sometimes I just want to get away... so far away, from everyone I know. I want to start over new so that I mean more to everyone than a stupid ditzy girl. But that's all I am, no one takes me serious. Don't get me wrong because I have a lot of fun, but sometimes, just once in a while, I would like someone to be there to take me serious, and actually stay. Not talk to me one night and then shove their backs in my face the next day. I wish I wasn't so messed up... but at least I'm not bringing other people into this because I know how much that sucks. drama sucks. But when I really start getting close with someone it just gets messed up, because that obstacle is always going to win. This is why I tend to push people away, and why it's so ungodly hard for me to be close to anyone anymore. I do like being by myself sometimes though, and I hope that I'll still think this way in 40 years when I'm an old cat lady, living by herself in a small&nbsp;cabin in the woods. I don't think that would be too bad, because no matter how bad you piss off them cats, they come back for some more lovin'. Besides, I don't know what I want to do with my life, where I want to go, and I suck at everything. It's hard for me to care because there will always be something better. Question: does anyone know what it's like to have a brother living with you, but you haven't talked to him in 7 years? I can't believe I've lived here 7 years. I wonder how much happier I would be if we didn't move here. Yeah, we have more material crap, but nothing can ever compare to my old life. I wish I could have one real friend who wouldn't get tired of me and stuff. Everyone talks about "remember in elementry school..." well i wasn't here to remember anything. The only thing I have to remember are people I don't even know anymore because they never want to take the time to call me back. I wish I were a kid again. They don't have messed up problems. Just let me go back ten years and let me play baseball with my brother and his friends, and play video games with nick and adam, or let me jump on my trampiline with christy and brittany, or go to jessicas so she can babysit me. Let me go back so I can visit Sherril and remember how she always gave me candy. Let me go back to the week before I moved and go to chuckie cheese with christy. Please let me go back to when I was happy.

      It is 11:21. The time stuff on this blog is 3 hours off so pay no attention to that. I have more energy today than so yesterday. I can't believe band starts tomorrow. But it is perfect timing because I don't have to work Monday - Friday. I'm scared to go in today though. I really hope he isn't there. He hasn't tried calling me yet&nbsp;today&nbsp;so that's a definite plus.  &nbsp; So I'm already done with season 5 of Friends. 5 more to go. What a great show. I can't wait for Joey's show.&nbsp;I hope it's good. He's so funny. I really need to get Season 6 now because the last episode of each season leaves you hanging so much, although I have already seen it.  &nbsp; I need a shower.

      I wish that I could tell someone everything. I guess it is better left unsaid. &nbsp; Yesterday I went to the mall with Mattie around 11. Then, I picked Lauren up and we went to the bandroom where everyone was repainting. It was fun there. Me. Her, AJ, Dave, and Nathan went to Taco Bell, of course. Then I went to Daves later on and watched Big Fish with him and Stephanie. i couldn't pay all that much attention to it but it was good. &nbsp; I've been thinking and I don't think I'm hurt over Chris, just over what happened. I want someone who knows what he wants, who knows me, who makes me laugh, who is my friend, and I know who that is. Telling him would just mess up everythong so there is really no point. It might not even be him, just someone like him. Oh well, who cares. &nbsp; I need to get ready for flute lessons. I really don't want to go anywhere. And I REALLY don't want to go to work tomorrow.

      I don't really want to talk about last night.&nbsp;Afterwards I didn't want to go home so I went to eat at taco bell (yeah alone) and to target. I think I called everyone on my phone list but no one was answering. I bought Friends Season 5 and just watched that last night. My phone is ringing right now. Just leave me alone and quit calling me, ok, thanks. I feel like throwing up or something so I'm going back to bed. &nbsp; Dear Pete, i love you and thank you. Dear 5-11, you guys are the best.  Dear Boys, girls are not play toys so don't treat them as such.

      I can't stop smiling. I'm so happy. Chris came and saw me @ work today. He looked so cute, wearing a cowboy hat with his friend whom also works with us. We are going out tomorrow night. I am very excited. By the way, I believe him about not having a girlfriend now. He's so wonderful. He stayed for at least an hour at my work and I talked to him, his friend, and Brandon... Jeremah some. I even spent my break standing with them which is very odd for me. I love his company and he makes me laugh like crazy. It feels so nice to be falling for someone. Brandon is extremely funny too.. thank you for helping me with my belt problems :-). God has been so gracious to me lately.     Everytime our eyes meet This feeling inside me... It's almost more than I can take.

      No one should ever tell me anything because I have a huge mouth and I suck.  Gosh my abs and legs hurt from mine and Robbie's work out yesterday.  I'm putting this band schedule on here for my benefit: Next week: 8AM - 12PM  6PM - 9PM 2nd week: 8AM - 9PM 3rd week: 6PM - 9PM I guess I won't be working a lot, which kind of disappoints me now. haha, that's not something you hear everyday.   Today I'm going to go cash my check and then go to work. But I don't have to work for the next three days so yay me.

      So once again I have an online journal, AKA Blog. :-)  Today was a good day. I got up quite early to go work out with Robbie @ the Y. I even ran a mile! Well after that we went to taco bell with Dave and Nathan. I ate 4 packs of fire sauce so I could be cool and get a "number" and wow did it hurt. Never do that. Well after we got back I came home and went to work. I love the people I work with. It's a new surrounding of people that are really amazing. There's Ranea, a guy who calls me Ms. Holleywood whenever I walk in. Danielle Goggans... really cool girl who went to my school. There's this one chris dude who is really sweet, as well as this super sweet black guy named Jeremy. And then there is Brandon and another chris. I have so much fun with them, especially today. Chris asked me out on a date which was quite sweet, but then again, he seems like the player type because he told me he had a girlfriend the other day, but now apparently they broke up. But oh well, a movie can't hurt anything, and besides I've really liked being around him since work started. Tomorrow is the last day I have to work for a few days so yay. This has been the busiest summer ever but really interesting. I'm ready for band and my senior year... so much is changing already. I really wish I knew career path I wanted to take though. Hmp, oh well, I have a couple of months I guess. Well I'm going to bed shortly... yay for getting to sleep in.

      I found 2 four leave clovers yesterday at practice. I gave one to Dave bc he's my bfb. He isn't right now though cause him and Nathan and Brandon beat me up after school *inster mean face*  I really don't want to go to work today. It sucks. And tomorrow is AJs party but I have to work. I miss hanging out with my friends. I'm gonna try to get off work tomorrow. I didn't have to at first, but I told Tomi I'd work for her.  I'm so sleepy.

      It kind of makes me mad that I had plans with a friend to go somewhere but it doesn't matter if I'm the one who gets disappointed, only if the others do. whatever.  school is dumb, my classes are dumb.  Everyone thinks that their life is worst than everyone elses, but it isn't, for the most part. We all go through our messed up family lives in different ways. Me and carrie were talking about this the other day, and it's true. We think that our lives our so unbearable, but when you hear about other people you know you aren't alone. I guess it takes a few years to get out of that stage.  A lot of people in our senior class are a bunch of idiots. I still don't feel like a senior until I see my junior friends and it's like "well if they're juniors i have to be a senior" but it's still weird. I'm not anxious to graduate anytime soon though. I don't want to go to the real world and blah blah blah.  so I have to work today, Friday, and Saturday and more than likely Sunday. I think I'm gonna start looking for a new job. I guess I really don't want to do anything though.

      Today was ok as far as school goes. First period with Mrs. Clark is fine, but it will suck having math first period. Then second is percussion. I like it because it's more quality time with dave and brandon, but all i did was hit the cowbell alllll day and hit my fingers a million times. It hurt like crazyyy. So I sat in the senior section and it didn't feel like i was supposed to be up there. Some other stupid girls made a huge deal about it and ran to their seats which looked kind of dumb to me. Third period is civics. I can already tell I won't like it much. And then 4th is band. After school I hung out with Dave and Nathan. I love how we all three have been hanging out together more lately.  We went to taco bell and hung out at daves. Yay dave and nathan!!  Blahhhh homework!

      So summer vacation is officially over, and it was nice for the most part. I could have enjoyed it a lot more if I didn't work, but nonetheless I had a lot of fun. Me and Mattie were talking about stuff that happened in middle school the other day, it seems so far away now.  So after work today I ran some errands and saw AJ at the mall. I ended up eating some pizza with him. And I'm on a diet too. I'm naughty.  Due to lack of sleep last night I'm tired, but doubt I'll be able to sleep because for some reason one never can before the first day of school. It still doesn't feel like summer is over though.

      Today I went to the lake with Mattie and whonot. It was fun. It reminded me of camp dogwood. I really like hanging out with them and I wish we could more often.  So tonight I watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Dave and Nathan. I've decided that my movie nights with them are my absolute favorite. It should be like a more often thing. but now that schools starting it'll be hard. But with them I really feel like I belong, and it's so awesome, because I know they want to hangout with me too.  BUT, they're on my bad list right now. As I said, we watched Texas Chainsaw, and they played the worst joke on me in the freakin world. Daves dad stood outside Daves door with a chainsaw and started beating on it. hello... freak out time. And this continued for a while. Thanks to them I had the scariest middle of the night by myself ride home ever.

      Ok so today @ work wasn't as bad as it has been. Ranea was there and I really like him, but then friggin Chris was there. God. LEAVE ME ALONE! I think he finally got the point, bc he was in the breakroom when I went on break and I actually was mean. go me. And he ended it with like "well, can we still hangout and not go on dates?" pshhhh, oh ok so we'll go to the movies to hangout but not consider it a date. whatever loser. I have to go in at 9:30 tomorrow. Why the crap so I have to work every weekend, saturday and sunday. I really hope I find someone to go in for me. I really hope Brooklyns hires me because I'm so miserable there. But where am I not? Oh, Dave's mom came in today. She is so my favorite customer for many reasons. Too bad not every customer is like her.  How can you be happy without knowing what you want? Because if you don't know what you want, how will you know when you have it? I'm not lonely or anything because I'm not like everyone else. I don't have to be with someone and could care less about it until I find someone worth while. I just need something, but once again I don't know what.  I miss Georgia. I miss some of the people who used to be in my life.

      Sometimes it gets so annoying to watch how people act when they're placed around different people. If you love someone so much, why would you constantly talk about them? I wish people would quit telling me things because they think I want to hear it. It's  ridiculus  to be so two faced. I'm tired of people telling me what is right for me. I know what's right for me, and I'll be with whomever I want.

      Sometimes I feel like I force myself to like something, like music. Today I went to the flute smith and got some stuff that was on sale. But am I really passionate about playing the flute, or do I just want to be passionate about something? I mean, I do love playing the flute, but I don't know if it's because it's just so, or because I think about it too much. It's so confusing.  Today wasn't bad. I hung out with Pete, Lauren, and Scott. I went to brooklyns with Peter and Lauren and Scott waited on us. I love my Scott.  tomorrow I work from 7 - 11. Not bad, but Saturday I work from 9:30 - 2:45. I'm gonna try and get off because it's my last free weekend. But I do have Mrs Clark for my math class again which is wonderful.  It is 2:24 and I'm pretty awake. Doesn't matter though, I can sleep in tomorrow. I haven't been able to say that in a while. Oh yeah, I applied to Brooklyns to be a hostess. I've decided I hate working at Food Lion, although I love the people, I can't do something I hate so much. I would like to do office stuff at a vet or something such as that but I doubt I'll find somewhere.  Anyways, I'm going to clean my room (which is something I only do at night for some odd reason...)

      Today was full of fun. Me and Melissa woke up and picked up Beth, then went to Melissa's to swim with Nathan and John. Then we all went to Taco Bell. mmmmm. Then we went back to Melissas and they watched rockadoodle while i slept. mmm sleep! Well then we went to band practice and after that Dave, Nathan, and myself watched Fear dot com. It was really weird. It was hard to be too scared because Nathan was uhhhhh jokeful tonight! Dave and him kept doing faces that I hate. I was terrified the whole way home, I just knew a little girl was going to be in my backseat. ahhh. But in conclusion I had fun anyway, hanging out with 2 of my best friends.  School starts in 4 days. ugh. what the heck. senior year... woop de friggin do.  I have a bruise under my foot and gosh it hurts to walk.  I'm in need of something new.  I can't believe people who have been out of highschool so long are still making things dramatized.

      I got my hair done today. All I did was touch up the highlites and trim it though. I think next summer i was to dye it strawberry redish and get platinum highlites. wooo i'm crazy.  my stomach hurts and it has been all day. ugh.  I played my flute and piccolo today. It was kind of nice to play something besides marching band stuff, but then I got frustrated because I suck at Concertino (which happens to be our all district piece) and gave up.

I'm so tired of being here Supressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone.

      This poem is so beautiful. I found it at  urlLink www.poemhunter.com  . And I think we can all related to it. It's by Thomas Moore.   On Music   When through life unblest we rove, Losing all that made life dear, Should some notes we used to love, In days of boyhood, meet our ear, Oh! how welcome breathes the strain! Wakening thoughts that long have slept, Kindling former smiles again In faded eyes that long have wept.  Like the gale, that sighs along Beds of oriental flowers, Is the grateful breath of song, That once was heard in happier hours. Fill'd with balm the gale sighs on, Though the flowers have sunk in death; So, when pleasure's dream is gone, Its memory lives in Music's breath.  Music, oh, how faint, how weak, Language fades before thy spell! Why should Feeling ever speak, When thou canst breathe her soul so well? Friendship's balmy words may feign, Love's are even more false than they; Oh! 'tis only music's strain Can sweetly soothe, and not betray.  -Thomas Moore   In other words, music speaks the unspoken and soothes the soul.    I think I really want to major in musical performance. It's just so hard... but that makes me want to do it more.  ugh idk.
