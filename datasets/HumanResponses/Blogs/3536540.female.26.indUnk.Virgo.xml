      Helene...once again comes from your average american household. Mom and Dad both psychologists. Adopted Helene and her younger sister Delva. Nice big house, middle class, good educational background. But somewhere along the lines something went terribly wrong.   Helene really is one of the sweetest people you could ever meet. I would even dare to say naive. She posessed that "child-like" personality that can be annoying cute at times. However, when it cam e to common sense, she sometimes fell a little short.   One of my earliest memories of Helene was back in high school. It was Halloween. I'm standing at my locker exchanging books for my next class, when a round of snickering breaks out along the hall. And to my amazement, what do I see?  Helene the ballerina. Complete with pink tu-tu and slippers. "what's so amusing about that" you may be asking. Well, Helene was not the most physically fit person at this time. All of 5'1 and pushing 200 pounds...lets just say, you know how kids are. And through all this, Helene just continued down the hall, as if no one had even noticed her. Bad choice of costume or high self esteem? You pick.  Helene seemed to take the role as the "voice of reason" most of the time. She wasn't a big drinker...most of the time, and never really got into the drug game. Helene's downfall was that she was just a "hopeless romantic". Within days of meeting someone, Helene had their whole lives planned out ahead of them. I'll explain why that was considered her downfall. While there is absolutly nothing wrong with being a romantic, you can't really believe that you will find your soulmate in a D.C. nightclub or at a "house party". Helene's first love went by "Nino". Seemed to treat Helene ok, but landed himself in prison for 10 years + for his involvedment in a driveby shooting that cost a human life. All the forensic evidence and investigating point to him as the triggerman. No if's, ands, or but's about it. It really was too bad that he chose to take this path. Nino was an extremely talented artist. So in fact, that he was commissioned by the city of Alexandria to paint murals through-out one of its low income communitys. Those of you familiar with Alexandria in the 90's may recall "Arna Valley" and if you're former residents or neighbors, you'll recall the coloful murals painted on the retaining walls within the community. But Arna Valley is long gone and and replaced by swanky condos and townhouses.   So Helene is naturally heartbroken. And remains so for quite a time. Times passes, and then, finally, someone else comes into her life.   "Pana", whose real name is Carlos if I remember correctly, was also one of those nice romantic types. By far not the most handsome GQ guy around, but his personality made up for what he lacked elsewhere. Pana was a musician. Playing guitar, Helene seemed to fall in love with him almost instantly. Considering the guys he hung around with, Pana was the exception to the stereotype of poor, hispanic trouble-making guy. Their relationship grew slowly. Pana would serenade Helene at night, and be her protector at all times.   Once again, Helene was not someone that I've maintained contact with. We would see each other around every once in a blue moon. At last check, Helene and Pana, who has since lost his nickname and goes by Carlos, have a extremely adorable son together, Christian. They were still living with her parents, and both made the transition from rowdy kids to responsible adults.

      Kim. Kim seemd to be the most "ok" person in this circle of gal pals. Came from a well-to-do family. Parents still married. One older sister, and one younger. Kim could be classified as the "party" girl. Didn't really dig high school too much, so didn't really bother. Besides, she had a very busy social schedule to keep to. It was rare to find this girl at home on any given night. Hitting the club scene took Kim approximately two hours every night to prepare for, which is kinda odd considering the clubs she regulared were not very "classy", in fact, there were downright nasty.   Those of you local people may recall such places as "Tracks", the mostly gay nightclub in the middle of Southeast D.C., which dedicated Friday nights to people of all sexual preferences, and drew mostly "gang" crowds. There was also "Chambers", again in Southeast, which was totally thuggish-ruggish. This place was probably about the size of my first one bedroom apartment. To everyone's dismay, Chambers was shut down by city officals after several fierce shoot-outs and fights that took place there and drugs busts. Apparently, the owner/manager has a bit of a nose-candy problem. Another hot spot was "Fifth Column". Pretty big for a club, but fell into the same category as the previously mentioned.   Now, Kim had once of those on-again, off-again relationships with her high school sweetheart Rolando. Nice guy, extremely intelligent, straight-forward type of person. No one really knows what happened between those two. At that point in time, her main squeeze was Rene. Rene was a tad bit older than Kim. The "bad-boy" type. But Rene too had a bit of an infidelity problem. Just couldn't keep his hands off the young ladies. Somewhere along the way, Rene gets caught up in the whole gang thing. Now he's really a "gangsta". Sleep all day, no job, drink and smoke-out every night of the week. And Kim...she's cool with it all. You see, Rene's new found circle of homies has presented an opportunity for Kim to become more socially stimulated. More parties, more alcohol, more drugs. And let's face, Kim loved to party.   So where did this lead? Welcome to northern Virginia's gang association. Here's the quick rundown of Kim's Homies:      Vatos Locos (VL) - fairly new to the area around this time, Kim       came to know this gang through her ex-boyfriends cousin who just moved here from L.A. Carlos seemed like a pretty nice guy, except for when alchol came into play, and he became obsessed with displaying his "VL" stomach tattoo to anyone who seemed to be a rival.       LI - specific to Alexandria, or more commonly known as Chiriliagua, this started with basically a group of four or five friends, one of which was none other than Stephanie's ex-boyfriend. Of Salvadorean descent, these guys somehow managed to turn their small gaggle of friends to what would be the beginning of very well known gang in that area. Of course now comes the controversary...Kim's boyfriend's cousin (not the aforementioned) decised that he no longer wants to be associated with VL (probably because for some unknown reason they turn on him) and turns to his best friends older brother to take him under his wing. BIG NO-NO. VL wants their homies back, while LI protects their new recruit. Fighting ensues. A few arrests, and all is forgotten. Sort of.   As you can see, Kim kept a well rounded group of friends. Ranging from her middle-class childhood pals to Alexandria's ghetto gangs. Luckily, no harm or legal trouble came her way as a result of these alliances. That's not to say Kim didn't have her fair share of trouble with the law. Let's just say that Kim's troubles stemmed mostly from traffic violations.   Now leap forward a few years...I haven't mainatined any real contact with Kim, but as usual, word get around the mill. Last I heard, Kim was seen partying in D.C. (still) with a gallge of friends and hearty supply of her little "white" friend. Guess for some people, nothing really changes.

      Stephanie. Possibly the most dysfunctional, confused person I've ever met. My relationship with Stephanie started about 9 years ago, when we were both high school students (remember the titans?). Stephanie came from your typical broken home. Mother and father, both of Mexican descent, had one of those fly by night relationships that were never destined to last any amount of time. Dad splits, and is not heard from again. Mom re-marries a very nice man named Mike...briefly. That lasts long enough for her mom to have a son by him, and split herself. Leaving Mike to care for Stephanie and new son David...alone.   Obviously, all of this leaves a traumatic impact on both children. Stephanie, who now finds her "belonging" in the arms of any man, or boy at that time, that would have her, and David, who is emotionally withdrawn from the outside world, yet, attached via umbilical to his father to point that at age 10 or 11 he still sleeps in dad's bed (?).   Back to the beginning, 1995. Having just transferred from a private boarding school to finish my high school career at the local public high school, I reunite with a girlfriend from my elementary years in catholic school, Pam. My, oh, my...how people have changed. Being that I had been away from home most of my school life, Pam introduces me to three of her closest friends...Stephanie, Kim, and Helene (I'll get to the others later). Cool gals to hang out with. A few weeks into the new friendships, I started noticing that when Stephanie would say she was hanging out with her boyfriend, the consistent response was "With which one?" And they say promiscuity is not as prevalent in  certain social classes....?   So there was Robert. Robert was about three years older than her. Apparently they have been dating, or hooking-up as most people would call it, since she was a freshman and he was a senior.  Well, after graduation, or maybe before...who knows, Robert becomes a raging alcoholic and abusive to Stephanie. What does Stephanie do? She continues to profess her undying love for him but manages to find "comfort" in the arms of random guys to make up for the "love" missing from her relationship with Robert. Keep in mind that at this point they are pretty much living together.   They fight, break-up, and like many domestically violent relationships....get back together. Staying true to the cycle of violence.   Example 1: Stephanie and Robert have a huge fight about her wanting to go out with the girls to a nightclub in D.C. Robert protests. They argue. He leaves. We "the girls" go out. Stephanie meets some random guy and spends the majority of the night with him. She takes him home with her (yes, back to the house where she and her boyfriend reside) and gets busted in the middle of doing the "hokie-pokie" by Roberts banging on their bedroom window, wanting to come in because he doesn't have his keys. Stephanie, not being the brightest bulb in the pack, turns on the bedroom light, and completely opens the blinds to see who's creating a disturbance at her window. SURPRISE! Stephanie and "Guy" are both sitting there butter-ball naked looking into the face of her boyfriend. And she wonders why he busted the window. Robert proceeds to go back to the front door, kicking it in, while "guy" manages to jump out of the window Robert just busted out, and makes a beeline for his car. What does Stephanie have to say for herself? "Robert, you're drunk...you must have halluncinated. There was nobody in here with me". They continue to fight, break up, and sure as ever, they're back together in a few days...of course only after Stephanie fakes a pregnancy and makes him feel guilty about stressing her out.   But don't worry. The whole fake pregnancy thing went smooth as silk, because after reconciling, they decide to move away to Texas, and along the way...oops! somebody's period shows up. Great excuse for a miscarriage. Phew! Perfect timing. Texas doesn't last long. A few weeks maybe before he assaults her again, they get kicked out of her family's house, and end up having to come back to Northern Virginia.  Flash forward a year or so...Stephanie's having a baby! For real this time. Only one problem...who is her baby's daddy? Could it be Robert? Maybe, because even though by this point they are no longer living together or considering themselves a couple, they still have special "benefits" with each other. Could it be Sandro? Her actual boyfriend of a few months and future husband? Could it be another one of the random guys she hooked up with one night while her and Sandro were fighting? Talk about a sticky situation. Lucky for her, Sandro, being the nice guy that he is, takes on the responsibility (keep in mind that Sandro has no clue about Stephanie's extra-curricular activities). Baby's almost here. They get married. Seems like a happy ending for all. Except for one thing. Baby Angelica looks stunningly like Robert, and his entire family for that matter. Hmmmm....Oh well.   Eventually, Stephanie convinces Sandro that they should raise their family in Texas. So they move. Baby number 2 comes. It's a boy. Followed by baby number 3. All seems well on the family-front, or at least on the surface it does. You see, a marriage and three children later, Stephanie still can't find adequate love from her husband, and has no other alternative but to find it in the arms of other men. Which according to her is completely his fault because "he cannot satisfy her physically or emotionally". So she finds a "regular". Sandro is clueless. "Mr. Regular" supposedly falls in love with Stephanie, and decides to show up at her house one night, knowing that she is married and living with her husband. Unfortunately, Stephanie's not home, and Sandro answers the door holding their newborn daughter. As you can imagine, he is quite curious why there is a guy at his door looking for his wife (who ironically is at that moment with another guy having dinner when she's supposed to be visiting family). And like most men, I would imagine, Sandro falls into the "alpha-male" syndrome, and in a few choice words makes it clear that "Mr. Regular" had better stay away from his wife. More words are exchanged. "Mr. Regular" pulls a gun from his waistline, and shoots Sandro, standing in his doorway holding his daughter.   A month had passed before I had heard the news about this incident. Thankfully, Sandro is ok and "Mr. Regular" is in jail.   I haven't heard much from that side of the world since then. Last I heard, Stephanie and Sandro were seeking marriage counseling to try work through her infidelity problems.
