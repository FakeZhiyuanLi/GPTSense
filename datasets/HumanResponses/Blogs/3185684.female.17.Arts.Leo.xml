      I went to the store today, needing to buy some ink refills for my pen. I thought that I would find the item I was looking for quickly and within five minutes I would be out of the store. Well, things didn’t go exactly as planned. It took me a lot longer to find refills than I thought, but not too terribly wrong. What is really of note here is when I got to the counter. There was an older woman in front of me checking out. She was dressed fairly nicely and had a cart full of items. The checker began to scan the items and I noticed that a lot of them were Valentine’s Day items that hadn’t been sold and so were marked down considerably to get them out of the store. Before the cashier scanned each item the woman would say, “Now make sure that it rings up for 75%, otherwise I don’t want it.” Well, of course, not all the items rung up correctly and every time an item failed to be discounted she did not want it. These went on for about a dozen items, and a line of about three people had formed behind me. Then the cashier scanned other household items, all them having bright orange stickers, announcing that their price was reduced. After another five minutes of this the woman dug into her purse and pulled out a whole handful of coupons. The cashier had to go through at least eight coupons, making sure that each was the correct coupon for the item she had purchased. Some weren’t, and true to form, the woman wanted those items taken off her bill. The really icing on the cake was when she announced quite loudly that she had forgotten Q-Tips, because she had a 25% coupon. I was about ready to burst into laughter thinking that I was on television, it was like the woman that everyone jokes about but doesn’t think really exists. Well the line that formed behind me began to get restless, and honestly I was getting a little anxious. The man directly behind me threw his purchase on the counter and walked out cursing under his breath.  What really got me though was how focused this woman was on saving fifty cents on mascara. I mean does it really matter that much to buy Valentine’s Day candy for seventy-five cents instead of a dollar? We live in a society so addicted to money that we will do whatever it takes to save a nickel or a dime here or there. I can make an inference that this woman had probably been collecting coupons for several weeks to try and save five or six dollars. I don’t think God wants us to do that. The first commandment says that we shall no other gods before Him, anything we give more attention than God is sinning, including clipping coupons.  Now, I am not saying that we should never try and save a dollar here or there, that is good stewardship. It is apparent though that this woman has dedicated a good portion of her time to trying to make her budget go as far as possible. I think it is reasonable to say that God gave us this life and these resources to enjoy and appreciate. What is wrong with going to a nice restaurant every now and then? What is wrong with buying some nice clothes occasionally? God wants us to be happy too.

      Guilt? I only feel guilt when I sin.  I think guilt is a great thing. An awesome thing. I think it's God's way of whispering, "Hey, maybe you shouldn't do that again." If I feel guilty, I know I've done something wrong and I try to change it. Well,  try  is the operative word here. Here's a piece from my online diary, just so everyone knows how much I appreciate all of them... youth group has really changed me... this blog really is a great idea... :   Without Wednesday youth group, I wouldn't be who I am right now. I'm not a christian but I am an individual touched by God. I went to the First Baptist Church thinking that I would have to lie about my past and who I am and how I think to fit in with a bunch of hypocritical christians who think that if a person doesn't fit the description of a Jesus Freak, then they shouldn't go to church.  Instead I found a bunch of people just like me with the same guilts, dilemmas, and sins they were trying to overcome. The youth leader declares that sometimes he's not even sure if God exists, and reading the Bible doesn't make things easier... it makes things completely different. More complicated. But he doesn't feel uncomfortable announcing he's a christian because he overcomes all of his doubts. He doesn't feel bad if he doesn't live up to everyone else's standards of Christianity because he knows what he is trying to do. God knows what he is trying to do. At least, that's how I see it...  I want to be like that.  The Bible says that being a christian doesn't have to change the outside of a person. In fact, no one may notice the changes... no one except God. But really, that's all that matters right? Who cares if people don't get you or your beliefs? God does.  Mike Y. said that christians spend too much time preaching about their religion and trying to change other people that they're not really listening to God. They're not fully in touch with God.   I like Mike Y. He thinks like I do.   A sin's a sin, and the christians and the atheists sin just as much as the other one does. The difference between them is that the christians are trying to change.   You can't call yourself a christian unless you're willing to let God work through you. But I don't believe in labeling myself anyway.  I don't call myself a christian because I'd rather just be known for my love of God, rather than be associated with an entire group of people. I would like to be filed under "Worshipper of God" rather than under a group of people where I question their faith.  I am trying to change. I go through a mood swing of emotions and thoughts where I try to get a grip on myself. I try to work on the sins that are overtaking me. I can stop what I say or do at any time, if I really wanted to. But can I stop what I think? The way I think? I'm trying, but emotional struggles are so much harder to calm than physicalities.   I may look to you just like another teenager, naive and prejudiced, judging and stupid. But I'm letting God work through me and I struggle with what He tells me to do everyday. See me walk down the hallways with a smile, but inside there's a war between my mind and my soul.   I'm not like everyone now. I'm not like the girl you saw on New Years. You may not be able to tell the difference.   But God can.

      on another issue all together....guilt...what about guilt....what place does it play in my life?....should all christians feel guilty after watching the passion....or after going to church on sunday morning....or just reading the bible.....is there such a thing as too much guilt....maybe.....maybe not.....I know that for a long time I had a lot of guilt about a lot of stuff and I prayed for God to help me with my problems...but it didn't seem like it helpled all too much...so is God not powerful enough to help me...or am I too weak to help myself....or a combination of both....I don't think guilt should lead to a loss of faith....thats a bad deal....  Of course we should feel guilty about watching our savior be crucified. He was there because of all of our sins, and our shortcomings in the eyes of God. I don't think a person should be a Christian just because they think Jesus was a decent guy and what happened to him sucked. I think there are a lot of decent people who got screwed over in life but I don't go on worshipping them. The guilt should be because he was who he was, not solely because of what happened to him.   Guilt shouldn't lead to a loss of faith, I think feeling guilty about sinning leads to more faith. Also, I'm not too sure that God answers all prayers as well as we'd like him to. Maybe not seeing the ideas he has for us is the main problem.  Also, everytime I think about guilt in that way I picture myself as one of the crazy fire and brimstone type preachers screaming "Every time you sin you're saying that Jesus's death wasn't good enough for you!" then I giggle, I haven't sat down and put much thought to whether that is justifiable or not, I can just picture someone saying that and it makes me laugh, oh well...

      so...it seems that I am the minority on this one....hmm...didn't expect that to happen at all....I always assumed that those i taught when take on my viewpoints...not saying that its a bad thing...actually i am quite happy that there is disagreement here...makes things much more interesting and it challenges me in my faith...we have to be challenged more...i think that christians try too hard sometimes to try and be nice...."thats whats wrong with you people....you just walk out when things get tough....you don't stay and fight...."....well let me tell you....I will stay and fight...  on another issue all together....guilt...what about guilt....what place does it play in my life?....should all christians feel guilty after watching the passion....or after going to church on sunday morning....or just reading the bible.....is there such a thing as too much guilt....maybe.....maybe not.....I know that for a long time I had a lot of guilt about a lot of stuff and I prayed for God to help me with my problems...but it didn't seem like it helpled all too much...so is God not powerful enough to help me...or am I too weak to help myself....or a combination of both....I don't think guilt should lead to a loss of faith....thats a bad deal....

      I'd think that masturbating is a better alternative than to be sexually impure with another person. In that case you're bringing other people into your own sin, and leading them further away from God.   Any sin can totally control someones life, and masturbation is no different, anything that takes away from the worship of God is a sin, and when I consciously make the decision to stay at home and masturbate rather than go to church, then I'll consider myself a problem child. Until then, it's how I deal with impure thoughts, and thanks to the book at the Youth Convention, I know I'm not alone in that regard.   And I don't care if I've shared too much.

      Lusting is way too hard not to do. I don't think masturbation can help someone stop lusting in some situations.  Say, you have a girlfriend that you spend a lot of time with.  Will it help to just masturbate EVERY TIME before you see her so that you won't have impure thoughts about her? That's a heck of a lot of work to do, rather than just trying to control your urges.  We have souls here, it seems like a reasonable idea. It seems very possible to contain yourself if you genuinely want to.  First, you have to believe that masturbation is a sexual sin and then every time you have a desire to lust, remind yourself that it is wrong.    I never said that I believe people shouldn't masturbate, it's just fun to be on the other side of the spectrum for once... Christians have way harder problems to cope with than masturbation.    And to Robb, I'll be sure to remind you of what you should be worried about.  If, in fact, I am that talented or intellectual.

      I wish I had sexy problems.  People write books about sexual temptation, about dealing with believing in an all-knowing God, about helping their relationship with Jesus, and all sorts of thought-provoking questions.  I haven't found a book about not caring or not being able to care.  It's not that I don't care about Jesus, our relationship, and my faith. I do, but I find that I don't care about a lot of things that I should, and it doesn't seem like I'm cut out to care.   I don't have a problem with my problems. I have a problem that I don't have a problem with my problems. I do things that are wrong, just like everyone else, and I constantly think of them. I think about them, sometimes talk to someone about them, most of the time pray about them, eventually forget about them.   I don't know how to deal with faith, grace, and or righteousness, that's my problem. I go to youth and we read passages from scripture and I say "Gee...that's fine and dandy..." then someone comes in with something that is so much more spiritual and thoughtful than anything I could have ever hoped to think of.   It's like I absolutely have to surround myself with these people who will think in depth about things and discuss them with me, or else I'll just find myself willingly walking into problems that I don't even think exist. I find a conflict within myself where I don't know if I can think for myself, but then in thinking about that I wonder that if someone worries that they're not thinking for themselves than they really are.  And I believe that that is called a paradox, although I don't know, someone just told me that's what it is.   Did I mention that I'm going to a Christian college next year, and that I hope to be able to teach other kids about the great faith that I have?  Maybe it's not that there isn't a book or help for people that don't care, maybe I just haven't been led there yet. I always think about people who blindly go through life not knowing whether or not what they're doing is wrong or right, but not really trying to find out. I think I'm one of those people. I just don't want to be.  Maybe there is a book about not caring, and maybe someone just hasn't shown it to me yet.

      So yesterday we had to give this presentation about the Christian subculture and how it has handled the topic of sexuality...for some odd reason we got talking about masturbation...and I ....being the strong minded person that I am....and willing to stir the pot a little...said that I don't think its that bigga deal....as long as it doesn't dominate ones life....of course....i was not met with much enthusiasm....many were offended about what i had to say...it felt like they were going to lynch me.....but....i don't think its a very black and white issue....sure there is lusting involved...and that has to somehow fall under the category of sexual immorality...well maybe not....be i am going to assume...but is it better for a teenage boy to sit in class and look at pretty girls and not think about the subject.....or is it better for him to masturbate....get that out of his mind and move on.....then maybe he can think clearly about God and his faith.....it just seems more beneficial in the long run...i am prolly wrong here....someone enlighten me....

      I just read the last chapter of Messy Spirituality again. I know that I have a chance if the thief being crucified next to Jesus got into Heaven. Grace isn't fair but it sure does beat not being forgiven... I worry about sinning but I think worrying and feeling guilty is like being forgiven... at least, I hope it is being forgiven.  It really isn't hard to receive grace. I just worry if that's enough to get into Heaven. I worry I will mess up my life with one huge sin and then I will die before I can ask for forgiveness... I have a huge fear. Going to Hell.

      I know....sometimes I wonder just why we are equipped for doing some much harm...I guess it makes it that much harder to be holy...sometimes i wonder if we can really attain holiness....not just for a  minute or two...but for entire days....like going without sinning for a couple weeks or something.....i hope that its true....because if there isn't a possibility of true holiness then i am sunk....and we are sunk as humans...I am not willing to believe that I cannot be perfect somehow....i guess cause thats i am always a humanist....i have been given enough ability to seek after God....if that ability disappears i think that we are no longer human.....sin is tough.....i haven't found a way to beat it yet....seek ye first the kingdom of God....and all things we will be added unto you......i can't help but think of the prayer that a man says after Jesus healed him, "Lord I believe.....help my unbelief...."......thats all I can hope for  Ryan

      God, come back here!  I feel that I am too far away from God to get back. (I know otherwise... but feelings are feelings.)  This past month, I've felt God's presence inside of me and in my life in the most powerful way, but suddenly, it's been running away...  It's my fault, not God's. He's always been there. I've just been stepping away from Him... knowingly.  I'm a girl with stupid teenage hormones that get me into trouble. I've been reading countless verses/books of the Bible that tell me, "Stay strong in your convictions. Don't let sexuality or anything else get you down."  But it's pulling me by the arms and legs and I'm drowning in my own sin. It's taken me 17 years to see this. I feel guilty and disgusted with myself, but I indulge myself in sin everyday. Every minute. It's inside my thoughts, in my eyes, in my body. Everytime I watch a movie or a music video and wish that I could jump Jade Puget from AFI, I'm committing a sin.  It's inside my mind, but it's not inside my heart. I won't let it. At least, I hope I won't let it in...  But I'm fighting it every day. Every time I watch TV, read a book, or talk to someone, I feel like I'm thinking about sinning.  The fighting between my heart and mind has gotten so bad that I have headaches that will soon turn into migraines. I'm crying right now thinking about it. And yet, I still indulge myself in these tantalizing sins.  Why?  Because I'm human. Because it's in my nature to do so. But what separates me from all other creatures is my soul. Too bad my soul doesn't have a pause button to make me think before I act.   I don't know any way to cure it besides finding my faith again.  I go to church every Wednesday in hopes that my new friends will give me hope.  The way they act really does help me in the way I present myself.  I'm impressed by all of them and their way of handling things. A lot of them have been brought up with God their entire life.  I've been brought up away from God with my family.    I hope this is God's way of helping me. I've asked him for a big favor here.

      And so we pray easy prayers and mistake them for mature prayers - “God, if it’s your will, please heal so and so. God, if it’s your will, please give me a wife or a husband or a friend. God please change my heart.” The problem isn’t that we want too much - the problem is that we want too little and too weakly.  The truth is, we suspect, deep down inside, that God really couldn’t care less. And we’d rather not face that suspicion, or the disappointment of hoping and not having an answer, so we insulate ourselves with weak desire, small hopes - easy prayers.   -Bob Hyatt http://www.theooze.com/articles/article.cfm?id=790

      We all have friends who we think aren't going on the right path... I don't really know what to say to you.  A lot of us can simply give out the word of God and change a person... but others won't listen... and a lot of them don't believe.    You can always guide them on the path, but don't flat out say, "Change because what you are doing is wrong."  Chances are, you make a lot of mistakes too, so your friends will be confused when you tell them what to do when you could heed your own advice.  I would say, just make comments to them like, "Do what you want to do, not what everyone else says," and reassure them that you love them just the way they are.    Man, that was some cheesy Chicken Soup advice, but it's all I really have right now... I've been in your situation before... but unfortunately, I had to let those friends go down their own path...alone.

      I think that this is going to be a great thing for the youth group.  We never really get to talk about stuff as much as i would like to.  I hope that the topics we concieve will be wonderful.  well as for me right now, i have a lot of stuff going on.  graduation is coming up.  i have a bunch of stuff to do for ABY.  my personal life feels like it is in shambles.  work is horrible.  but my christian walk is getting better everyday.  my friendships with people are getting stronger also.  i love you guys.  without you guys to help keep me straight i would be a mess.  just remember to keep close.  love ya.

      i've got a tough situation.  there are two people i know that need help...but won't exactly listen to it and think about their actions. they aren't going in the right direction with their lives and they can't see that. all they can see is that they are beginning to be "popular" and they are being noticed. i don't want to just sit by and watch something bad happen to them...i want to try to do my best to help. then if they don't get it or they don't want my help i'll step aside and let them keep doing what they're doing. hopefully though they will realize what they are doing to themselves and change. i don't want to seem pushy to them or like i am judging them. i just want them to know that i care about them and what they are unconsciously doing to themselves. i want to help, but i don't know if trying to talk to them may help or if there is something else i can do to let them know that i am extremely concerned. if anyone has ANY suggestions, please let me know!  OH! and please work on getting donations for camp (so my dad will cut his hair) it goes to 2 good causes.....us going to camp and the hair going to locks of love. and we get some humor on the side watching my soon to be 40 dad that hasn't cut his mullet off since high school. if you ask people you don't even have to mentions that my dad is getting his hair cut.....you can just ask if anyone wants to donate toward the fund to help send the youth to camp. thanx guys!!!!!

      Love is an odd thing...I think it falls into the same category as hope...its a wonderful thing...but a very dangerous one at the same time...how much does it cost to love something....well...to love someone right I believe that it takes everything....and in giving up of oneself do we truy live...it seems so meaningless to not want to love...if God can be defined it is only in the context of love....there is no other single word that can come close to what God is all about....I was just reading this sappy email that I had gotten a long time ago....and it says something like, "it takes a short time for you to meet someone...but forever to forget them..." there are people that I have met that I will never ever forget...like Christ...sometimes it seems like years since we have last had a conversation...but I will never forget those handful of moments when I truly felt one with my Creator...I know a lot of you have had those moments...especially at camp last year...sometimes remembering those moments when you felt God's love is some fraction of its true potential...is all that keeps us going....I am glad that God doesn't come down and brush my soul very often...I don't think that I am strong enough to take it all...a couple times has treated me just fine...

      Drew's here.   I like Mike...every quote that I hear from him amazes me. The one that Ryan posted rules to all get-out.  I have a few problems in my life, just like everyone else. Just the other day though, while thinking through them, I really have tried to shift my views on them. In my life my main problems that I have to deal with, the only things that I think about daily, are 1. God, and, 2. Katie. I looked at my faith, and lack of, as a problem, and I looked at my relationship, and lack of, with Katie as a problem, but I don't want to anymore. I realize how much of a blessing it is having these problems in my life. I'd rather be worried about my relationships with God, and with her, than be worried about anything else. I've even begun to believe that my problems are enviable. If everyone had a problem with their perceived lack of faith. If only someone had such a great friend in their life that they'd worry about their relationship with them as much as I do. I don't want to look at my problems as problems anymore. I want to look at them as blessings, even though I don't want to stop improving, so that I don't even have anything to be perceived as problems anymore. I know it's not possible to not have problems, but it's the essence of faith to believe that it does impossible things.

      I always find it interesting how in my own life I can be perfectly happy with how my life is going, only to have some random event shake me to the core. The worst part about these events is that they seem to come from the most unlikely of places. I hear lyrics to a new song, analyze an old passage in a new light, or have someone tell you a secret that is completely unexpected.  What I find really interesting is that these moments seem to shape my life. Most people look back on monumental events that help them construct their ideas (9-11, the War in Iraq) that help them define their sense of self. And while these events have caused me to look differently at many things I originally took for granted, they haven't changed who I was/am.  I know that you have heard me time and time again say that, "Dude, that changed my life". But when these somewhat insignificant moments happen I know that my life has truly changed and I need to do a better job of embracing those changes.  Don't dismiss the seemingly insignificant moments because you never know if they could be life changing.

      I am beginning to understand that faith is not the way around pain, it is the way through pain. Faith doesn't get rid of the opposition, it invites it over for dinner. Faith doesn't give you the winning point at the last second, it ties the game and sends you into overtime. Faith doesn't give you the solution, it forces you to find it. - Mike Yaconelli  I love Mike Yaconelli...I never met him...but I can't help but think that we were kindred spirits....created from the same mold.....I resonate so much with this quote....I think sometimes we make our faith into a way to escape from our problems....like if I just sing loud enough and long enough and go to church everytime the doors are open then I will forget about how terrible my life is.....that is not faith...faith does not answer all questions...faith does not have the magic bullet in every situation...faith is a means by which we can attempt at trying to find meaning and purpose...it is not the answer to every question....the Bible didn't cover everything....I hope that we always remember that Christ doesn't fix all our problems...instead he gives us that boost when we desperately need it....

      Hey guys...now I feel all special that I have been included in this great inner circle that y'all have been apart of lately. I hope that I can add as much to this discussion as you have already. If there are ever any questions you want from a more Weslyan perspective, I'm the guy to talk to. Well, I will keep tabs and chime in later if I have anything to add. You are also, really making some really good points and I am impressed that you are willing to put so much thought into these issues.

      I think it's very important to remember that it is one of many sins. In this specific case I know the book Adventures in Missing the Point: How the Culture Controlled Church Neutered the Gospel was really eye opening in it's thought about Homosexuals. I should really reread it, because it separated the idea of being gay into two specific things, the act and the thought, and it was just really interesting to read. I don't remember the terms that the author(s) used, but it was interesting nonetheless. I really hate seeing "Christians" protesting gay pride festivals with signs that say "God Hates Fags" among the malicious phrases. I wish there were people there right next to them with signs that say something to the effect of God loving everyone...cause that's what I always thought he did. I don't know the exact specifics...but for every verse of scripture that talks about God not liking the act of homosexuality, I bet there are 100+ that talk about God loving everyone regardless of their drawbacks.

      So, today I got the new YM that the company insists on sending me although I did not pay for it.  In it was an article of what it was like to have gay parents.  This girl broke up with her boyfriend because he told her once that homosexuality was sinful.  This raises a dilemma here.  I'm disgusted by the world's actions in response to homosexuality.  They commit hate crimes and talk about it being disgusting, when I simply see it as another sin the world commits.  A lie being told around school doesn't disgust me... so why should christians be 'grossed out' by homosexuality?    How do we go about loving and interacting with gay people without pissing them off? Who likes to be told they're commiting a sin? And what should kids do when they have gay parents? Are they supposed to support it? How can they not when they see two people sincerely and happily in love?  When I think about that, it's hard to see love as a sin.  I never thought it was a sin... until I took the Bible word for word.  I don't want to think it is.  What do you guys think?

      I found this article today and I thought it was thought provoking...lets hear what you all think.   The Failure of Youth Ministry by Mike Yaconelli  See related apology  What is the most important function of youth ministry?  A) Introducing young people to Jesus B) Providing healthy activities C) Involving young people in service D) Abstinence pledges E) Good theological training F) Worship  Answer: None of the above.  The most important function of youth ministry is longevity. Long-term discipleship.  It's my contention that the vast majority of youth ministries focus all of their time and energy on the none-of-the-aboves and very little on longevity. How do I know?  Look at the results.  Attend any youth group in this country and notice the "ageing effect."  Attendance is directly proportional to age. The older the students, the fewer are likely to attend youth group. Typically, there are more freshman than sophomores, more sophomores than juniors, and more juniors than seniors.  I'm sure there are many reasons for this phenomenon. Older students are more likely to work, more likely to have a car, and more likely to be extremely busy. But the real reason is that older students are much more likely to lose interest in Christianity, lose the desire to stay close to Christ, or don't lose the willingness to pay the price of commitment. In the everyday battle for the souls of the older students, the lure of the secular is just too strong.  Almost every study out there shows that when it comes to moral behavior, there's no difference between secular and Christian students. They drink as much, screw as much, have oral sex as much, and party as much.  Why?  Youth ministry doesn't have any staying power.  Young people flock to Christian concerts, cheer Jesus at large events, and work on service projects. Unfortunately, it's not because of Jesus; it's because they're young!  The success of youth ministry in this country is an illusion.  Very little youth ministry has a lasting impact on students.  I believe we're no more effective today reaching young people with the gospel than we've ever been. In spite of all the dazzling super stars of youth ministry, the amazing array of YS products, the thousands of youth ministry training events, nothing much has changed.  Following Jesus is hard.  Faith is difficult.  Discipleship requires a huge investment of time. Most of us don't have the time. Or we chose not to take the time. Or our current models of ministry don't allow us the time.  So let's be honest.  Youth ministry as an experiment has failed. If we want to see the church survive, we need to rethink youth ministry.  What does that mean? I don't have a clue. But my hunch is that if we want to see young people have a faith that lasts, then we have to completely change the way we do youth ministry in America.  I wonder if any of us has the courage to try.

      Do you know how hard it is to get somebody into church that doesn't believe in God?  I do.  When you get them to finally go to church it is the best feeling in the world.  Knowing that you helped in leading somebody to God.  But you want to know what HURTS the WORST?  To see that person walk out the door because somebody ran them out just because they might not have liked them that much,  or somebody didn't want them to be there.  That is the worst feeling in the world.  The feeling of FAILURE even though you know that it is not your flat but, you just cant help but feel that if you would have said something to that person that person that you brought to God would still be there with you and God.    I don't know what to do.  I know that it is going to take me even longer to get Thomas to come back to youth.  I also know that he is going to be afraid to come back because he is going to think that he is not wanted.  I thought that church was a place for anybody and everybody but we still pick and choose who we want to be there and who we don't want to be there.    I guess that out of all this my question is why do we do that.  Why do we push people out the door and tell them that they are not wanted there.  I thought God said bring all people to me, but we still push them away saying that God is to good for them.  But when you look at it God looks to the people that nobody else like he also looks to the people that we push out the door.   Cates

      We should admit we're broken... because when I feel judged by a Christian of all people, it is the worst feeling in the world. I feel like my own people have failed me.  This happens all the time, where Christians look down upon other people because they have not followed God's law... it's like, they're afraid to be around cursing or talking about things that make them feel uncomfortable, or... well... sinners.  But isn't that the biggest test of all... being around other sinners and not letting that affect you negatively?   I told someone that this Saturday I was going to go see "Mean Girls." Come on, Tina Fey... funny woman.  They looked at me disapprovingly and said, "I don't want to see it. I heard it's really perverted."  That's fine to not want to see it if you don't think it will be funny, but it just brings me to this point.  How can we go through life with our eyes closed, ignoring every single bad thing in our life? How are other christians supposed to help other sinners when they don't want to get near any of it?    If we can't sit through a movie, how will we get through life?

      At Vespers last nite we had the opportunity to hear a wonderful message by a freshman here at the college. Now from a textbook standpoint is was okay...not too great...maybe a little long...but what really stood out to me...and a lot of those who were there...was how honest the speaker was....he said that he was a sinner...he was a failure...and went so far as to list the sins that he constantly struggles with...while he was saying this tears began to well in his eyes...and we all just knew that he cared deeply that he was so unworthy...it would have made Mike Yaconelli very proud...  I have been thinking about all this stuff that we have been talking about here...about people that don't want to go to church...don't care about God...I am beginning to think that all we can do as Christians is be broken...broken and honest people before God and everyone....don't claim that we are holy....don't claim that we have all the answers...don't claim that Christ will make you life perfect...because quite frankly he has ruined mine...in a good way...  It is time for us to just tell it like it is...we struggle...everyday...we doubt...all the time...we don't love our neighbors as ourselves....we basically suck...we need grace....I think that wil be a breath of fresh air...and I think people will respond...i may be way off on all that...but its the best I got...

      Have you ever really needed to talk to someone but you haven't been able to come up with the right words to say.  Well, apparently this seems to be my problem right now.  I have something utterly important to talk to someone about but I just can't.  I don't really know how to approach this one.  I have prayed about this one a lot.  It's just that nothing ever really comes to my mind.  I won't feel normal until I talk to them about the subject.  Just pray and help me.  I am also severely scared of graduation.  At first I was getting really excited about the fact that I won't be in high school anymore.  But the more I think about it, I just get a little scared.  I know I am just going to a community college.  But I feel like I am not ready for the responsibility of a life in the real world.  I am going to miss high school a lot.  College is going to be a lot different.  I won't have to go to class if I don't feel like it.  I just don't know if I am ready for it.  I just ask for prayer in this.  I need all the help I can get in this.  Thanks.

      I think that you've handled it absolutely perfectly. Not too pushy, but you stood up for what you believed in and you actually did something about it.  I would have just said, "Yeah, a lot of people think this youth group this is lame...sorry about bringing you here."  But that's not how we should react at all.  We should react like you and instead of making excuses for why other people don't see God as we do, we should open the doors for them to see... and keep them open... a lot of us close our doors when we lose hope in people.  I don't think we should ever give up hope.

             Why is it so hard to talk to people about God?  I am a Christian and I know that every chance that I get I should talk about him, but I know that I am not the perfect Christian so I feel like I cant talk about him.  I have always prayed that god would strength me and bring somebody to me that needed god and he did.  He kinda hit me in the face with it and I felt like I was a idiot for not seeing it earlier        I finally sucked up all my guts and started talking about god to a friend. At first all I could get out of him was a no.  Just a big FAT "NO"  I didn't want to push the subject so I thought that I would lay off and see what happens.  (Maybe I started to get the wheels in his head turning)  then one day when I went up to youth he was in there playing halo.  I was in shock!! I asked what he was doing here and I got a funny answer.   He said " I am killing people in the name of the lord."  Right before we really started youth he left, I ask why and he said that he didn't want to stay for the next part.  I didn't say anything to him I just let him go still thinking that god has him now and god will take care of it now.  I got him there and now I will let god do the rest.          When I saw him the next week at school I could feel god wanting me to say something to him about youth, it was kinda like god was telling me not to let him forget about youth.  So I thought about what I was going to say to him the whole day.  Finally I told him I would make him a deal.  I want him to stay for at least one night of youth.  I asked him if he would keep an open mind about it and to try not to go in there thinking that I hate god and I am just doing this to get him (me,Curtis) off my back.  HE told me that he would do it and that he would keep an open mind about everything.          I want to ask everybody to pray for my friend (Thomas) that God will talk to him and he will allow god into his heart.  I know that he needs god because he is starting to come out of some hard times and I know that this will just be icing on the cake for him.          I also told him that if he doesn't like youth that he doesn't have to come at all but if he still wanted to that he could keep coming to play halo if he wanted.  At least he coming to church and maybe after a while he will come to know god.  (Ryan I hope that is ok to do)          Curtis Cates

      What really bothers me is people say they don't have time for God. God made us, God gave us all that we have, God could take it all away... and yet, we don't have  time  for Him? How hard is it to put down the TV remote and read the Bible for a little bit? How hard is it to stop jabbering on the phone so that you can pray?   And how come I know all of this, and yet  I  act as if I don't have time for God?  Why do I know the facts and yet, repute them?

      You know what I get sick of....well...actually a whole lotta stuff....God did give me a critical spirt....I have to use it...but anyway...back to this specific instance of agitation...I really don't like how Christians do their best to try and not be controversial...we don't talk about politics..we don't discuss the latest news...we don't discuss the holes that exist in the bible...we don't go out on a limb and say things that might .....just might....make a whole lotta sense...  everyone is in the same boat.....i have realized that a lot of christians think that church...the instituion...not just our church... is not doing a good job...but no one says anything...for two reasons....one....the same people who think there are a whole lot problems don't have any solutions....or two....they know the problems and have a good guess at solutions...but are too scared to vocalize their beliefs because they are scared what the other people in the room will think about them...  give you an example...I was at this convention and we were supposed to break up in groups of five or six and do some dumb exercise that was really just an excuse for the speaker to go pee...and I was talking with this group of three youth workers from seattlle who were starting this new ministry...we were talking about effective ways to minister...and I said that maybe the best solution is to not come into ministry thinking we have all the answers...that maybe Christianity doesn't answer all life's question...btw...i am a little reluctant to write this on this blog...so don't tell anybody....anyway...these three folks from Seattle looked at me like I was the anti-Christ.....later we were told to pray in those groups about our ministries...I was thinking the whole time that I was praying out loud that those three people must think that God doesn't even listen to my prayers....  the worst kind of judgement is silent judgement...if you are gonna think that I am a heretic at least tell it to my face...instead of going back to your regular group and telling a story about this crazy extremist you met at a youth convention...  alright...rant ended...

      On my way to church yesterday I began to reflect on what Megan wrote about her friends. I have been in that situation and thought about how helpless I felt, caring about these individuals but not being able to do anything. It is important to let people make their own decisions (from what I hear it gets harder as we grow older, we we later have to let our children make choices that could harm themselves). Having felt helplessness and the shere inability to change the situation, I strated to think that there is no feeling worse than helplessness. But I had to stop myself and say, "YES THERE IS".  Megan's friends are potentially heading toward the worst place anyone can find themselves, hopeless. A life without hope is similar to a life without meaning, because of the redemptive power of Christ we have something to look forward to (both in this life and eternity). Without hope we try to find ourselves in several avenues attempting to find what is worth living for. All of these are shallow and unfulfilling. I cannot imagine a meaningless life with nothing to look forward to.  Helplessness is not hopelessness. Christianity is a pah of chosen helplessness (for some) not a life of hopelessness. When my grandmother passed away two years ago, I was here in Illinois while the rest of my family was back in Ohio. I believe now that part of the reason I came out to Greenville (along with meeting all of you), was so Christ could use my grandmother's passing to break my stubborn and unruly attitude towards others. I used to be a very proud individual, but because of the helplessness I experienced in the darkest time of my life, I was broken. In the darkest place we find God and that is a comfortable thought. During this time, I reconnected with my family and with God. Christ uses helplessness as a tool to break the pride of stubborn people. I AM BROKEN.

      I know there are some people who are turned off to God no matter what. I know a lot of people come to Christ because they see something in their lives that needs changing. Some people don't feel they need changing, some people coast through life without a care in the world, not even needing God because they already have what they need and/or want. I don't like to think that God excludes people when he decides to dole out forgiveness and grace. I think it's there for the taking, just some people choose not to. It's also my belief that someday everyone will realize exactly what they were missing when they decided to shut God out from their lives. The-"every knee will bow, every heart will confess"-thing. If God's love isn't there for everyone to take, then this Christianity thing is a bunch of crap.

      You know it seems that there are just some folks out there that don't get it...that will never get it....like God has really hardened their hearts....it seems so stupid...but I don't know if Christ came to save everyone...whenver he took the cup at the Last Supper he said "this blood is shed for  many  for the remission of sin," notice that he didn't say everyone. I just don't understand how someone can totally reject God...how can anyone think that life is all about having a lot of fun....doing whatever you want...it seems like a selfish lazy excuse if you ask me...I guess God wouldn't want anyone to be in heaven if they didn't want to be with Him so that's what Hell is all about...  On another topic altogether...I think we are going to postpone this Wednesday's evangelistic push...a couple of folks aren't going to be there and I really want everyone to try and attend...I am shooting for at least thirty people...I am starting to pray in advance that God will show up...I know that He will show up when he darn well pleases...but I will much appreciate it if He would show himself to some of the people in our group...I think that a lot of us desperately need it....

      I'm getting lonely sitting here bored, realizing it's 1 pm on a Sunday and I bet a lot of people at the FBC are having lots of fun... Robb!!! Where are you when I need to use you for a ride!?! ...I kid, I kid...  By the way, I was kind of 'sadded out' when a guy from the youth group came up to me the other day.  I asked, "Hey, are you going to the ' evangelistic'  youth group on Wednesday?"   He replied, "Nah, I never really believed in God. I just went there because of Halo."  I began thinking, "Well, at least church kept him out of trouble..."   I'd like to think that God WILL work for everyone, but a lot of people seem to tune Him out.  I guess I'm kind of in the same boat as Megan again.

      I think Katie is right on with her advice. So many times in our lives we get so consumed with everyone else's actions that we tend to forget about that our own actions have circumstances. In my experience, some of the best medicine for those who have lost their way is reality. It is difficult to let go of those you care about, but in the same regard you don't want to try to control their choices.  Perhaps the best I can tell you, Megan, is to live an outstanding life for Christ. Share with these individuals how much you care about their well-being, then  show  them how they should be living. I will keep you and your friends in my prayers that all things will happen as God sees it.  Don't give up hope, for without hope we are adrift in a storm with no shore in sight.

      Abercrombie and Fitch put pictures of naked people on their bags when you get stuff from a store. Big deal.  You might not like it... but it's art, either way. Sure, they're trying to make big bucks off of sexuality and it works... but Christians shouldn't freak out about it.  If they spend their entire life being uncomfortable by pictures of naked people, they're never going to be able to step foot inside an art gallery or even worse... get married and have sex!  I think people are way too uptight about "being pure" and not letting lust get in the way of their life.  They say that explicit pictures are bad and shouldn't be shown, but really, isn't it just a picture until someone interprets it otherwise?  Isn't it the own person's fault for feeling lust for these things? Should we make it illegal for people to cuss, drink, or wear whatever clothes they want just to make the Christians happy so that they will be sheltered even more from... well... the real world!?

      So...tonite was my last night ever at a Greenville College chapel type event...now let me tell you...that is an odd odd thing...I was taken aback not because of the music or the atmosphere...but the fact that its over....no more of the same stuff for the last four years...time for me to grow up and face the world and all that garbage.. (begin rant) you know what I am sick of...the christian subculture...I am absolutely sick of how restrictive it is...we have a christian book store on campus..actually about fifty feet from apartment...there is this little poster in the window of this store that says "EXPERIENCE THE PASSION HERE"....what in the world does all that crap mean?....I don't what to be crucified...I read the book...why in the world would someone want to experience that....  what really got me is....all the crap that this bookstore has about the passion....there are books and cds and necklaces...necklaces for goodness sakes...these people are exploiting the death of my messiah...the savior of the world has been reduced to a fake nail hanging on a piece of leather around some thirteen year old kid in the midwest...and we are fine with that...because its at least not a hemp necklace or something....  I have a major...major problem with that....if I walk in this christian bookstore right now and pick out all the books that will still matter in fifty years...i guarantee I could hold them in one hand...there are about fifteen books that begin with the phrase..."The Purpose Driven...."....theres the purpose driven life....the purpose driven church....purpose driven youth ministry...there is a journal to accompany the purpose driven life....  guess what?....I am purpose driven too...my purpose is to show christ's love to everyone...period...I don't need a book from the bookstore to tell me how to do all that stuff...and before the purpose driven life it was the prayer of jabez....before that it was what would Jesus do bracelets...these books will not matter in fifty years....not at all...  I will tell you what will matter though....the book of common prayer...mere christianity...augustine's confessions....summa theologicae by aquinas....not some book telling me to how be sexually pure by starving my eyes....its all fluff...its about money just as much as anything....you can buy a crown of thorns now...a crown of thorns....terrific...give me five....at forty bucks a piece....

      I don't know what's wrong, but lately I haven't even been able to concentrate enough on praying to do it for just a few minutes. Prayer has almost become a struggle. That leads me to wonder if there is any way to clear my head for a few minutes each night so I can speak to God, or if the fact that I can't concentrate is really my prayer. Maybe I don't even know how to pray, and I'm not really missing anything. I usually sit there and talk to myself for a little bit about all the things I think need prayed about, then I mix in the words "God", "Lord", "Father." I don't know if I'm doing it right or not, but I just don't feel the same.

      So I was at church Sunday and I was having one of those day that I didn't want to be there.  I was daydreaming and doing all the stuff that I shouldn't be doing in church (nothing bad just not paying any attention.) So I grabbed one of those cards that you fill out and put in the offering so they know that you were at church, and I started to fill it out.   I put my name on it  and then my phone number, then my address and city, then I came down to the part where you check on of the boxes to tell what you are in the church or if you are a visitor or what ever.  Well I was thinking on what I should put and I ended up marking the box: I WOULD LIKE TO BECOME A CHRISTIAN.  And I was thinking I can tell people that I am a christian but deep down I know that I don't act like one ( I have been saved but I still don't feel like one) I know that from time to time you are not going to feel like a christian but I think the only time I really feel like a Christian is when I do something in gods name for somebody and that is not to often.  I feel good about myself but I don't feel like a Christian.  I know that there is nothing wrong with feeling like that but to me there is something wrong with it because I know that I can do better then what I am doing but I just don't try.  And I think that there are other people around me that think that they could be better Christians and I hope that every day you try to become a better Christian.     Cates

      Brian D. McLaren:   Despite our sincerity and best of motives, preachers like me mess people up.  It's unintentional, believe me: we're just trying to protect people.  But we damage people nonetheless.  We want to protect folks from alcoholism and drunkennes, so we tell them not to drink any alcoholic beverages.  To protect them from alcohol, we recommend they avoid establishments that serve it.  To be on the safe side, we tell them to avoid people who drink alcohol... and to avoid excessive laughter as you'd hear from tipsy people...and, in fact, to avoid parties in general except the boring ones.  We want to protect folks from extramarital sex, so we create so much tension around the subject that we make people uncomfortable not only with the opposite sex, but with their own sexuality, too.  Okay, we preachers admit, maybe we'll create a little sexual anxiety, maybe some of our hearers will become a tad nerdly, weird, uptight-- but at least they won't get into overt sexual trouble. We hope.  We want to protect folks from following the crowd and succumbing to peer pressure, so we imply -or outright assert- that good Christians don't go to R-rated movies (or any movies at all), don't listen to rap music (or any popular music at all).  We discourage them from making non-Christian friends.  We approve them spending all their time in church services, church meetings, church activities- safe rabbit holes, a protective Christian ghetto.  We want to protect our folks from greediness- so we create a preaching climate that suggests it is morally and biblical dubious to make good money, to be extraordinary successful, to maximize their earning potential.  We imply that middle-class ambitions are okay, that mediocrity of any sort is safest.  We want to protect folks from losing their faith, so we warn them against reading philosophy, from participating in culture and the arts, from dealing with tough questions and contreversial issues.  We preachers exhort them to avoid the sciences (they might accept evolution!), avoid the social sciences (they might sympathize with liberals, criminals, and homosexuals!),  avoid the arts (they may have to look at nudes!).  We recite pat answers and platitudes, even when it makes us feel dishonest, shallow, trite, tortured.  We feel justified, though, convincing ourselves that even a bad faith is better than a lost faith.  In short, wanting to protect our congregations from becoming of the world, we preachers tell them, "Don't be in it."  We're just more comfortable to have Christians under our influence to be outside our culture rather than  in  it,  into  it, or  with  it.   There's only one problem: in trying to save people from the world, we miss the point. We actually ruin people. ------ It goes on about what Ryan was talking about... about missing the point in movies and such.

      http://www.seanbaby.com/news/jackass.htm  It's tremendously funny, it talks about parents worrying that their kids see violence, and then duplicate it. Also it gives me another chance to tell someone about Seanbaby, who cracks me up.

      So....I was thinking about what Katie was saying when her friends told her that mean girls was perverted and that she shouldn't go to see it....how dumb is that...seriously...I actually saw Mean Girls on Saturday with Jacqueline and we both enjoyed it...I mean sure...it wasn't a kid movie...but it is not supposed to be...I think it did a good job of portraying high school...at least when I was in high school...I just hate this whole idea of...if a movie has bad language or a little nudity..then it can't be a good movie....  I was thinking about that a little further and began to think about the Passion...now it is a violent movie...I don't know if you all have seen it yet...but it is incredibly and brutally violent...now...I never heard a Christian say that the violence there was excessive and reason enough to not go and see it...but I read an article by a Christian once saying that Christians should not go see Saving Private Ryan because there were curse words in the battle scenes...I don't know if Christians know this or not....but when people are getting shot at or having their friends die in their arms...they are not saying  gee golly gosh...or oh fiddlesticks...It seems like a little hypocritical too me...I guess I am just odd though...  Then I was thinking about all how many of my favorite movies have foul language...violence...sexuality...and all that "bad" stuff....let's see here...American Beauty begins with Kevin Spacey masturbating in the shower...now as a Christian I should have turned that off immediately....but then I would have never thought about whether his character was truly a good person...and what makes a person good....and what is the purpose of modern suburban life  Or...the Matrix...lets face it...the movie opens up with Trinity beating up a bunch of police officers...i mean POLICE OFFICERS...how disrespectful is that....but then I would have never began asking eternal questions...like how do I know what is real?...what is the meaning of all this?....could I handle knowing all the truth about the world?...but these questions shouldn't be asked by Christians....only really important ones should be asked...like how far is too far on a date...and how much should we further alienate homosexuals....those really...eternal....things...should dominate our lives...  well...I have a whole lot more to say...but maybe later....pax

      That's very interesting. I don't really know what he says the problem with the way everyone does youth group now is...except that it's screwed up. I think our youth is awesome, and I know it's changed my life for the better. I think if Mike could have seen us the way we used to be and the way we are now I think he'd think we (and you Ryan) have succeeded.

      Tomorrow is my last day of being able to come and see you guys (on a regular basis), and I just wanted to thank you all for how much of a difference each and everyone of you has made on my life.  I first want to thank Ryan for giving me the opportunity to come and take part of the amazing group he had. For not being selfish, and making me feel that I had something to contribute to the group.  To everyone that has come and been a part of FBC Youth since I started working with it, thank you. I know few other groups that have the level of intimacy which you guys share. Never be afraid to care for someone else, it's because you guys cared enough for me that made this a rewarding experience. I don't believe I have ever met a more inquisitive group, and this puts you head and shoulders of many others your age. Never be afraid to question something that you don't feel is right, however, have faith. Have faith in somethings that can't be explained, and don't question faith.  I cherish you all and will miss you. Never be afriad to contact me if you need someone to talk to, because many people in the group will tell you that, I WILL do anything for anyone of you.   I love you ALL.  Drew  If you ever need anything 419-971-6796

      This idea that Jesus descended into Hell was found in one of the extra biblical materials...it was quite popular during the members of the early church...but was later left out our canon of scripture...there also is some alluding to this idea in the New Testament...  For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit,  through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built . In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities, and powers in submission to him. —1 Peter 3:18-22, NIV  There is also a problem between the translation...the word in the creed is actually "hades" which is not exactly the same as our idea of "hell"....but it is how it is translated...."hades" could better be translated as "the land of the dead"....if the whole thing were to be better translated....it should be "Jesus descended to the dead"....meaning that he really did die and was resurrected...I hope that clears something up...most people wonder about that line....I know that I did  Also..."I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church"....don't think that means Roman Catholic...that is catholic with a little c.....meaning "universal"...which I think that we believe that we are God's church...so....just a little add on..for anybody wondering...

      All right, I'm new to this... I feel stupid... but someone explain this to me. I just read the Apostles Creed...   I believe in God, the Father Almighty,     the Creator of heaven and earth,     and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:  Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit,     born of the Virgin Mary,     suffered under Pontius Pilate,     was crucified, died, and was buried.  He descended into hell.   The third day He arose again from the dead.  He ascended into heaven     and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,     whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church,     the communion of saints,     the forgiveness of sins,     the resurrection of the body,     and life everlasting.  Amen.

      The idea wasn't to go and apologize to every single person you've wronged. I'm sorry if you got that from my post, but the idea was that God should be asked for forgiveness first and foremost, but that sin hurts other people, too, and not only should a Christian be sorry to God, but also be sorry for the example they're setting. Hope I cleared things up.

      I was thinking about Robb's post...which I do from time to time...and I was thinking about confessions...and what that really means...its a pretty involved type process...I mean in the situation that Robb's lays out involves a lot of work....you have to apologize to God and a whole buncha ppl...that is kinda crappy...I think the more appropriate response would be to not do something stupid in front of a whole bunch of people...but I guess if you are on crack...then those things just tend to happen...  I think that Protestants lost something when they got rid of confession....before I start on a short rant...let me preface with this....I don't think that a priest has anything to do with me being forgiven...thats just silly...but there is a lot of value in admitting your sins outloud to another human being...chances are if you can't say what you have done to another human being...then  you shouldn't be doing it in the first place....there is something powerful about letting someone else in on what you are struggling with....it makes you feel like you are not alone...there is someone else in on it...at least they know about it...that's what counselors do...they just listen...and that is very helpful...to just listen...thats the first thing that I had to learn when I was counseling...don't try to fix things...just listen...guys...what...to.....fix..... things....well at least this guy does....  now this leads me to something new altogether...actually something that I have been talking about for a long time....authenticity....being transparent...I know that if a pastor would walk to the pulpit and say that he doubts...there would be half the congregation shaking their head and saying "me too, I am not alone"....I think that worst thing is feeling alone in your doubt....it makes me realize that I am not alone...and its okay....honesty...honesty...that is where its at....lets quit playing church...and start being the church...

      Sorry I missed the topic while it was new, and intead posted a new topic, and now I'm getting back to the last one...but...  To bring in common knowledge, Christians ask forgiveness from God for their sins, but doesn't that leave some people out?  I'm all for someone feeling bad if they did something wrong, but just asking God for forgiveness doesn't seem like it's enough, basically, it can be looked at as just blatant disassociation. Some sin is personal, but a lot of sin hurts more than just the sinner, and only asking God for forgiveness and grace is kind of shortsighted. Take for example this situation:   Say you're a coke head who needs a fix, but you don't have any money, so you get on a bus and rob everyone at gunpoint, and somehow, even though you're so twitchy, you get away with it. Then for some reason you get clean, and you feel terrible for robbing those poor people on that bus. In your anguish, you say you're sorry to the driver.  Isn't that leaving a few people out? What about all those other people on the bus with you who you stole from? Didn't they have bills to pay, kids to put through college, diapers to buy, coke habits to fill?   You inconvenienced an entire busload of people, and you only apologize to one person, given that person was the driver, taking everyone to their destination, and guiding them (oooh...parallel), but those other people are still like, "What the hell, he took from me too, don't I deserve and apology."   As another Christian on that bus, you probably shouldn't demand an apology from anyone, but what about the Hindu's, Jews, Muslims, and Aetheists on that bus? What kind of example are you setting to them?  The Christian idea of only asking God for forgiveness is an old world attitude that I think needs to be redone. Some would say that the best way to minister to someone is to show them through your life your love of Christ. Needless to say everyone screws up, so what kind of message are we sending people when we do screw up and only apologize to God, and not everyone else who was hurt by our failures?  -Robb.

      I was driving home tonight, thinking to myself about something that has been bothering me for some time...and I just came to the quick conclusion that I really can't do much by myself.   First, before I get into the more spiritual part of my post...I want to mention something else. It's not about God, but it ties in later. I figured out tonight that independence isn't just living by yourself, independence is living WITH yourself. Until you can live with the person that you are, you can't ever plan on doing anything. Nothing can happen in your life until you are completely happy with yourself. I know I'm saying that like it's a fact, and perhaps it isn't for anyone that happens to read this, but it's a fact for me, and this is my post, damnit.   I don't know how I could have ever thought that I could get by on my own. I always heard lessons or sermons saying that I need God, and all this stuff, and I'd say, "Yeah, I'm fine, I have plenty of God in me." It scares the hell out of me to think about how happy I was with myself, how safe I'd let myself become. Not only had I let myself become comfortable with my faith, my life, whatever, but I let everyone else become comfortable, too. My faith became user-friendly, and I wasn't scaring anyone, or challenging anyone.  Tonight, I found out that I couldn't do something...something I really wanted to do, probably more than anything I've ever wanted to do, and then I started thinking that I'm going to be disappointing myself for a really long time, like I already have been, unless I realize that I can't do anything by myself, let alone this one thing, without God.   I realized that I can't justify myself with any of my own actions, or with anything that I create in my own life. God justifies me. I've tried so long to create on my own, so that I could be able to justify myself. I can't do it. No one can. I'm so far behind everyone 'cause I know we've talked about this in youth before, and I'm just now figuring this thing out.   The scariest thing that comes to mind is what would have happened had I dealt with all of this before, if I had realized how powerless I was before this certain subject came up. Would anything be any different? Would I have succeeded in doing this one thing that I want so badly, instead of failing?   I don't know how I ever thought I could have done anything before. I guess tonight I was finally humbled. I think now I can finally call myself a Christian and mean it.  -Robb.

      I'm thinking the problem with me is that I know I have grace. It's not that I'm trying to cheat God and I'm saying, "Well he'll forgive me"...consciously...I know that kind of thought process is going on. I might not be thinking about it, but I know it in the back of my head. With grace I can get away with stuff that I shouldn't be able to, but it will save me. I think I'm just spoiled by God. If it was harder to be a Christian, if grace wasn't so good, and easy, maybe I'd be a better person. It's easy to turn away from God when you know he'll still be there if you want to turn back. The idea that what I'm told I'll want will still be there whenever I decide to want it, plagues me. If God would only say, "You want this...now!" then I'd have no choice, no turning away. If God told people that he wasn't going to be there next time they decided to sin, then wouldn't less people be sinning, and more people be acting like good little Christians? If God decided to stop giving me grace, I'd finally act like a better Christian...  ...but I'd miss out on love, which I have a beautiful, daily view of thanks to His grace, in which he never turns away from me.

      so...let me give everyone a little history on this hand raising business....as far as I can tell it has been going on for quite sometime...there was actually a strong movement among puritans in New England during the colonial days of people getting very animated with their worship...there was this group called the shakers that danced around and shook...obviously...but this strand of worship has had a place in christianity for a long long time....  now...fast forward a couple hundred years....there have been certain denominations that have always been very expressive in their worship...pentecostals are the ones that get the most notoriety for being very boisterous...some of them speak in tongues....the black churches are usually the same way....now a lot of this was very localized.....only certain denominations...but in the last twenty or thirty years came the advent of praise and worship music....before that there were just hymns....  now you have a whole plethora of songs....lord i lift your name on high....open the eyes of my heart lord....etc...etc....so....these songs are light on lyrics but heavy on a good melody....so...heres my postualte as to why so many people raise their hands....  first...these praise and worship choruses are very chant-ish....if thats even a word.....like open the eyes of my heart...you say the word holy...12 times in a row...lets face it folks...thats chanting...so...in doing that puts some people in sort of a trance like state...where things just happen....possibly somewhere this state someone was led to hold up their hands...someone else saw it....and all of a sudden...its like the mainstream thing to do....  now....i have no problems with this hand holding up thing...in general principle...but i do think that it can be dangerous....one has to be careful to think if they are doing it for what other ppl will think when they see them with their hands held up..."eww...they must be more spiritual....because they have their hand up..." type thing.....also...it shouldn't be contrived...i know of one person at Greenville who would put his hand up as soon as the first chord was played of any song....i am not one to judge...but it seems a little planned and routine...  so....enough on that subject...hope that wasn't too convoluted...

      All right, when I'm at a concert with a lot of Christian bands... or... well... at church, I see people with their eyes closed and their hands up, apparently feeling the light or touch or something to the effect of our Lord, and I can't help but feel like nothing like that will ever happen to me... is it normal? Do people do it because they can't control their body and something is telling them to or do they just do it because of something else that I'm not aware of... I wasn't raised in this... so I have never understood it.  It's probably a stupid question... but it needs to be explained to me.

      We were talking about atheists and where they go after they die, and I said, "Well, with you, would you believe that they wouldn't necessarily go to the Hell with burning flames and 5000 degree hot tubs and such?" and he said, "Are you talking about Dante's Inferno, Limbo, Purgatory and all of that junk?" I nodded and he replied, "Didn't that idea fade out with most of the Catholics?"   So, it's obvious that he's not a practicing Catholic or anything, but it still made me curious on the basic "rules" for being a Catholic.  What does it take? What do you believe that regular ol' christians don't/do believe? I could definitely just look this up on the internet somewhere, but it's so much better when Ryan, our lovely youth leader, or someone that is actually Catholic explains it to me.

      Christianity gave me the hope and love to forgive.  Without my faith, I don't think I could forgive the most awful thing that has ever happened to me...  To go into it further... I used to work for a prominent car lot in Salem with a boss who was infamous for harrassing younger women... say... teenage girls.  I didn't believe this because my best friend was his pseudo-step-daughter (almost, he never got married to her mom) and she was the one who got me this job.  Well, it turns out that everything was true, and he tried to sexually harrass me a number of times until I quit my job and filed a police report on him.    Sexual harrassment is more disgusting than murder to me.  If MY best friend was murdered, I wouldn't be as angry as if she had gotten raped.  It just seems like sexual perversion is higher up there on the disgusting list... it is more personal... anyone can kill someone... but to take away their dignity... even on the news, you hear about someone getting murdered and you think, "Oh, that sucks" but when you hear that someone was RAPED and murdered, you think "Oh, that REALLY SUCKS."  I could never forgive this man for what he had done to me and countless other faceless girls... until my faith set in and I felt the love of Jesus Christ.  If he could forgive everyone for what they had done to him, surely, I could forgive this troubled excuse of a man... maybe if more people would have been forgiving in his lifetime to him, he could have been a completely different person.    Forgive.  It's the only way you can accept yourself.

      I began work this past week in the factory...and needless to say, I have met some very colorful characters. One person is Michelle, who is a proclaimed Athiest, but pretty learned about Christianity (from what I can tell in casual conversation). As I was listening to her talk, I could tell there was a lot of bitterness in the things she was saying (and almost accusing me of). I asked her a pretty striaght forward question, Do you have hope, and her reply is that she has hope, but not faith.  The odd thing is that for me hope and faith should go hand in hand. Michelle describe to me a situation where someone would rape and kill members of my family, she then asked me if I could forgive that person. I believe that we as humans have the ability to forgive one another, no matter what wrongs have been done to us.  Michelle didn't like my answer at all, becuase she does not believe it to be possible to forgive individuals for the hanous acts they preform on others. It is her belief that individuals cannot completely forgive others, thus revealing that in fact she doesn't have faith or hope. She doesn't have hope in humanity and even more depressing she doesn't have faith in God.  I am wondering where you guys stand on forgiveness and mercy. Just something that I hope sparks a little discussion, because we've been a little quiet lately.

      (none of this is directed at you katie...just protestants in general) here's a news flash for all those who might just be reading this...catholics are not wrong...they are not the devil...they are not demented....they are not stupid...they are not drunks...they are not child molesters...they are good people....who have their own ideas about things...  to start with...with catholics we would not be here....the term protestant...the first part is protest...as in we protested against the catholic church...actually techinically not us...martin luther...followed by john calvin....john wesley...and a whole bunch of other great people...so without catholicism christianity could have been lost forever...and that would be a tragedy...so if one makes an argument that tradition makes something more truth..then the catholics have us beat hands down....  so...as far as catholic doctrine goes....most of it...surprisingly enough...is the same...i know that comes as a shock to a lot of people...but both catholics and protestants believe in the apostles creed and the basic tenets of our faith...or the dogmas...to use the proper theological term....  now...there are some differences though...the catholic church is headed up by one person..the pope...jp the 2 right now...he is the head of the church...basically he is the mouthpiece of God here on earth...followed by the bishops and archbishops and all that good stuff...its a hierarchy....while protestant churches don't have such a defined heirarchy...or thats what a lot of the protestants think....in the southern baptist church there is the president of the convention...who basically is the equivalent of the pope...then in the free methodist church there are four bishops in the US who are in charge of all the churches...so in some ways both branches have a heirarchy...even our church has a conference....with a regional office...and a regional minister and all that....  but....somethings really are different....catholics put much emphasis in saints....saint theresa..saint francis of assissi.....folks like that....people who lived very Godly lives that seemed to be especially gifted by God....the queen of the saints...thats Mary of course....now the protestants make a big hoop-la about this mary thing....heres how it really is....for some conservative catholics....mary was without sin before she bore jesus...but a lot of catholics don't buy that....but I think that in an attempt to distance ourselves from Mary we have actually gone to far and forgotten what she did...in carrying something that wasn't even hers for nine months...then raising him...and watching him be persecuted and then executed....thats a lot for anyone to bear...  so thats one thing....another is communion...now catholics believe in transubstantiation...thats a big fancy word meaning....they believe that the elements...the wine and the bread...actually become the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ....and because of that they have a closed communion...where only catholics in good standing with the church can take the elements....protestants believe that it just represents the body and blood....doesn't actually change into anything...and the table is more open.....  hhmmm....catholics also believe in purgatory....i haven't really researched that one too much...but I haven't heard many of my catholic friends talk about it...so....i can't speak too much on that subject....  i have learned a ton more about catholicism in the last four years....i have attended maybe a dozen masses...and i have become much more accepting of their faith....and how it relates to mine....there is something very very powerful about attending a catholic service...i have begun to notice more and more things that i really enjoy about the catholic service....it is much more active....standing....sitting...kneeling.....coming forward for communion....just some really good stuff going on there....  actually some of the greatest christian authors to have ever lived with very devout catholics....augustine....aquinas....henri nouwen....all these guys are incredibly helpful to me....but the sad part is most protestant bookstores won't carry their books...i don't understand the hatred...it seems so petty and such a waste of time....if any of you guys want to go to a catholic service sometime i would be glad to go with you...i enjoy them very much and i could help explain a little about what is going on and why it is happening....

      This doesn't really have to do with forgiveness, but it's been bothering me.  Don't you just hate it when people think that calling yourself christian means that you're a goody-goody self-righteous prick who hates sin so much that they are immune to it?  I do.  They don't really see the struggle that we have to go through all the time.  Most christians actually like sin... well, they do when they're not thinking about it.  We sin all the time to fulfill our own desires but we know the need to stop it.  We try to stop ourselves.  That's really a main difference between christians and other people.  We see sin and we know there's a problem... a lot of other people just bathe in theirs... I'm not saying that non-christians don't try to stop sin... but that's one duty every christian has that not all non-christians posess...  But see, we as christians, live a life to try to be like Christ... something we can never do.  Maybe, as Ryan says, we could have our perfect moments, but in the end, we'll never be exactly like Christ.  None of us.  So why do we live our lives like this?  It's a burden we all carry... and I know that I live my life like this because it's the only way I want to... it's the only way I ever can. It's the only way I can ever be truly fulfilled.  But that doesn't make christians prone to making mistakes.  So why do non-christians point their finger every time christians screw up?  Do they think it's their duty to point out the shortcomings of us because we're known for being sin-hating judgmental finger pointers ourselves? And what's with the phrase spoken in contempt: "You are SO christian."  What's that supposed to mean?  And they're "so NOT" ?   How can we get people to realize we're not so bad?... because no matter how you live your life, there's always going to be someone watching your every move...

      So...I was thinking about all this forgiveness business and I was reading my latest issue of Rolling Stone magazine...there was an article there all about forgiveness...now it wasn't some christian article...but it was a piece about these two guys that go around to schools and organizations and give talks about the subject...what makes these two people special is the fact that the one man killed the other man's son...the father of the deceased just happened to be a minister...  so...obviously the father was distraught...triyng to deal with this tragedy and all he could think was...i need to forgive this guy...so he wrote him a letter in prison...and there was a response...eventually these two guys got to be friends...and the father actually petitioned the parole board to let this guy...this killer...of his son...out early...and they did  the rest of the article was talking about the death penalty and how many families of victims feeled pressured by attorneys to push for the death penalty for their son or daughter's killer...well..there have been a number of people...who have lost someone to violence...who have come together under the unified idea that violence should not lead ot more violence and that capital punishment does not give them any sense of closure about the situation...  the last few paragraphs of the article really caught my attention  "In his spare, even cadence, the pastor has spent much of the hour explaining that forgiveness is an act of will, not an epiphanic favor from on high. It is sourced in the victim's wish to heal and has little or nothing to do with his faith in God or his political orientation. Indeed, in some cases, it even omits the offender, who either spurns the survivor's offer or who was never brought to justice in the first place."  "If I do something to harm you and say I'm sorry, but you say, 'Sorry, that doesn't cut it,' then I begin to heal and you're stuck," says Everett "By the same token, if you say I forgive you and I say, 'I don't need it,' then I'm the one who's stuck and you can heal. But if both things happen, then you can have a reconciliation: the coming together of two people after a terrible event."  http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story?id=6085540&pageid=rs.PoliticsArchive&pageregion=mainRegion  Just something to think about...thought it might spur some discussion.....Pax

      Drew- Carmen, yes, yes, Carmen. Now that is someone that I haven't heard about in a while. So he is using a little patriotism to get back on top. I guess he learned from Toby Keith, and that guy who sings that country song about the pledge of allegiance.   On the same topic really, I was driving by one of the churches in town and I saw that this Sunday is MARRIAGE PROTECTION SUNDAY. There is an bill going before Congress this week that will define what marriage is on a national scale. This will protect marriages. You know what I think will protect marriage in America, not having 5 out of every 9 marriages end in divorce. Not having shows on TV, which millions watch like "Who wants to marry a midget?"....and "Joe Millionaire". These shows are more detrimental to marriage than a committed gay couple wanting to be able to share health insurance.   By the way, Jesus speaks a whole lot about divorce, but not at all about homosexuality. What would happen if Congress was looking at a bill that would make divorce much harder to do? Would churches across America rally around that bill? I really don't think so, because there are a lot of divorced folks in their congregation. Its funny how the church picks and chooses what it will fight for.   In addition, what about a bill that would give more money to the school systems across America? To raise teachers wages? To give health care to every person under the age of 18 who is without coverage? To raise the federal minimum wage to a level that a parent can support their family on?   Nope, just gays. They are the real enemy.

      There's a good chance that many of you don't know a Christian singer named Carmen, but I assure you that he was pretty big within the Christian community ten or so years ago. Anyway, during offering yesterday we watched a "music video" for a Carmen song, called "America Again". The song is basically a proclamation about how the country is going to hell in a hand-basket and no one is stepping up to do anything about it. Now, perhaps I have become cynical because of my days at college, but I wasn't moved by this video. I was offended. Where I believe the general sentament of the song is true, any individual outside the "Christian sub-culture" who would view this video would be incredibly offended by it. The worst part in my opinion was how he was boiling these very difficult issues into black and white arguments (when they never are). The line, "You know we're in trouble when people would rather step out of the closet than clean it". I just sat back in my seat and thought about how clueless this guy is. Anyway, I digress. It became apparent to me why many Christians are disliked. In this war, close-mindedness and naivete are two of the biggest tools of our enemy. There are always lessons to be learned, from Christian and non-Christian alike, don't eliminate yourself from an opportunity to continue learning.

      I haven't checked this in a few days, but I'm glad it's being written on again.  And I am glad that the country considers homosexuality the number one priority. Political Leaders trying to make this country into a revival of the dark aged Roman Catholic Church is what's going to ruin America.  The reason America was started was because people got pissed off that churches or kings were running their government. Now we're trying to make it into the same thing that many of our ancestors were running from. I think Thomas Jefferson would puke with disgust if he were alive today.   The Fourth of July, crap songs that we were tortured with at FBC-Centralia were terrible, idiotic songs about exactly what America is not supposed to be...a country run by Christians for Christians and Christians only.   The institution of Holy Matrimony is a Christian thing, for Christians, having nothing to do with government. The entire debate about gay marriage would have been avoided if the government wouldn't try to Big Brother everyone and give them "marriage licenses." What the hell is a marriage license?! I know for my drivers license I had to pass a test, practice in a teachers car, and then practice with my parents. I'm all for them telling who can and can not operate a motor vehicle, because I can get killed by stupid people who think they're effing Dale Earnhardt, but if they want to tell me when they think I'm mature enough to find a soul mate, I think they're overstepping their boundaries from "overseer" and crawling ever closer to what I think they want the government to be, which falls somewhere between "deity," and "supreme deity."   To put it bluntly. The goverment is almost blatantly overstepping it's boundaries in trying to make this country everything that our forefathers hated.

      Ryan, you said you wanted to talk about that at CMF.&nbsp; I think it's a great idea... I think that's what goes through most teenagers' heads.&nbsp; I wrote a speech I had wanted to give at youth group once... but I never really had the guts to.&nbsp; It just covered about everything that went through my head right before I was saved... and I am really looking forward to you giving this speech at this concert... because there are so many young kids there that you could help with your words, and I think you know what needs to be said... well, kind of.&nbsp; You are asking people for advice, so I'm sure you haven't decided exactly what you're going to say... but what got me coming back to church time and time again was because of you and your neverending talk of this curious and wonderful thing called grace.&nbsp;People are too apathetic to change because they figure "It's just too late." But with grace... you can change anytime you want.&nbsp; You can change RIGHT NOW, and you have a clean slate.&nbsp; I know people hear this and know what grace is, but I don't think they realize that they can REALLY experience it too.&nbsp; I know that I've had times when I'm trying to get my priorities straight and I don't know how I'm going to battle everything... but then I realize that I have grace, and I try a little harder at everything.&nbsp; So, I've just ranted on about nothing that really makes sense to me, but I figure I'd just ramble for a little bit, considering no one posts here anymore...

      That's exactly how I feel.&nbsp; Every day.&nbsp; Everytime I do something that I know I shouldn't... something in the back of my mind is whispering, "Well, what does it matter anyway?" Maybe it's Satan.&nbsp; Maybe it's just an excuse to be lazy and uncaring.

      Well...I'm not really sure if anyone has anything to say...I just wanted to get on here real quick that I miss all of you. The intelligent conversations, the witty banter, and casual questions that ultimately turn into great discussions. I hope you are all having a great summer.

      I was reading this book by Tony Jones today about Post Modernity and there was a section on evangelism. Jones was speaking of the very emotional last night of camp where the speaker says come forward and be saved. I have always felt that was really contrived and manipulative. I never knew why until I saw this quote from Em Griffin. He called it Emotional Rape.  "The average preadolescent is not equipped to withstand the positive incentive of counselor approval or the negative force of group condemnation. The phrase 'age of consent' in our legal code points to the fact that children may be unable to say no to the forceful pursuader. Jesus made it clear that leading a child astray is a particularly heinous act. I think this applies to the methods used as well as the intended results."  I though that was really powerful.

      Things here are really boring...and honestly, all I do is sit around and miss Galion. I loved every minute I was there. Your family is so close, and so fun. Your church just feels like it's more family. A lot more close-knit than ours. Your dad's sermon that ran maybe a minute and a half was better than anything I've heard at our church...plus you're there. I wish I could go back to visit again.

      I am finding tonight, as I sit in my hoose, with nothing to do...eh, that I miss you guys very much. I would really appreciate it if you could tell me how things are going in Southern Illinois. How you summers are going, and what your plans are for the next few months. I would ask others...but no one seems to want to contribute anymore. If anyone else is reading this, I would like to know about you too. Love you guys.

      I just erased everything I typed...story of my life...I had something that I was really proud of...noticed that I didn't put a question mark in where there was one needed, so I hit the Back button, and it's all gone, and now the title of my post is very misleading, because it has nothing to do with what I'm writing...  I'll cut to the chase...I learned something today in Sunday School, another one of those things that I've been told, and taught before, but I never learned until much later on. So anyway, I've been in a bad mood for upwards of like (let's see, when did I get back from Galion?),  about 2 weeks now, and I'm just, I don't know, I'm trying to learn about the Bible, and the stories, and how they can be applied to me, and the nuances of the writings, and the peoples, and the tribes, and the cities, and things like that,  and I think I'm learning a lot, because I've asked some educated questions that have left Ryan at a loss for words, and I'm really proud of that, Ryan has taught me 98% of everything that I know about my faith, and when I can ask him a question and he replies with, "I don't know, I'll look into that," there aren't even words that can express how much joy I feel that I'm actually making him do some work and maybe he ends up learning something as well. Anyway, I do all that stuff, and I'm still in such a terrible mood, and it's kind of like, Why can't God let me be happy?" It's pretty simple to keep me happy, God remembers when I was happy. He knows exactly what I need, but I can't have it. So why won't he give it to me? Sunday School answer - "Because he knows what makes us happy better than we do". Funny story, I even said that today, and Mike ate it up. I say F that, I know what makes me happy. I know what made me happy, so I'm pissed. And I told you that story to tell you this one, Mike moved on, and kept talking and then I learned that God doesn't really care if I'm pissed at him. God is probably pretty happy that I'm pissed at him, because then at least I'm realizing that it's his fault that I'm pissed, and hurt, and learning that the only way I can feel these things is through Him. So I say: All honor, power, and glory be to God, even when he's a bastard and encroaching on my happiness.  Fin.
