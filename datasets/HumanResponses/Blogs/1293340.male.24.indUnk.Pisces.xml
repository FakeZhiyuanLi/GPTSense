      It's 7:45 in the morning, Another sleepless nite, Another empty day.  Everyday now feels the same, Each one running into the next.  I may be blue, And I may miss you, But I'm far too tired to.  My head is empty, My back aches, My chest feels like the world rests on it.  I could sleep, I could rest, But then I'd dream, And you'd be there And that pain makes The weight of the world seem like a balloon.

      I'm so cold, Sitting here, I shiver, Alone, My naked soul stinged and numbed by the harsh cold, The wind, cutting through my heart, Like a thousand razor blades,  I look up through my tear blurred eyes, Nothing, nothing, everywhere a nothing, A blanket of gray as far as my bloodshot eyes can see, Looking down, as I often do,  I see the face of punishment,  The face of a man I hardly know, Yet a man who's caused me more pain then anyman ever could. I grow hot with anger, My fist clenched tightly,  Knuckles white, Tears flowing from my eyes,  Why, I do not know, With all my anger I strike at my hatred, Stomping and kicking, Shattering the face, Breaking the mirror, Sending me spiraling downward, Into a black pool of depression, For I have been imprisioned by my enemy, Trapped by myself, Broken by my own body, Hated by my own mind, Damned by my insecurities.

      All alone again,  Another day, another night, Alone.  Gazing towards the heavens, I think;  Of you,  Of me,  Of us,  Of your eyes,  Of your smile,  Of your kiss,  Of your touch,  Of your laugh,  Of you sayin "I love you." Of you sayin "I want to spend forever with you" Of you with him,  Of your lips on him, Of you saying "I can't live without you," Of you saying "But, I cant live without his kiss." My heart turns,  My eyes burn,  I try to think,  Of the words to say, Words that will break your wall down, Melt your heart and arouse your soul. Of the words I can say, To get you back.  No words come,  But...,  I love you.

      I lie here in bed, Eyes gazing towards the ceiling, My arms hugging my pillow tight.  I close my eyes, i feel warmth, I lie here still, My arms now full of you.  Open eyes, empty arms, I think I'll close my eyes, And bring back you.

      Have you ever seen the face of God? It's there in your eyes, Your soft, beautiful eyes. Eyes that melt my heart, Look into my soul and warm me. Into their soft glow I am pulled. Til' your soul touches mine, Wrapping and twisting around my own. Our souls slowly merge into one another, I can no longer tell you from me. You become me, I become you. In that I find love. You blink and into reality I am pulled, But, love remains.

      I see you there, alone. I sit here, alone. I see your face, it takes my breath away. I meet your eyes with my own, my heart melts. I hear your soft, sweet, angelic voice, it warms my soul. I love you, more then you'll ever know. I love you, more then I'll ever show. I know it'll never be, for when I look to you, You look away. I love you still.

      It seems like yesterday was full of gray. I used to wonder why I'm ever here, Whats the purpose to life, When your life has no meaning. All I ever felt was loniness and fear. Til' the day you came along, My heart was empty, like a day without the sun. Now I'm filled with you. Everything good in me, is you. You are my heart, full of life. You are my soul, peaceful and warm. I no longer wonder why I'm here, The answers there..., In your smile.

      Searching, looking, seeking, All my life wanting love, But love never was found.  Hopeless, broken, defeated, I gave up, Gave in.  Then I found you, A beacon of hope, Shining bright and strong.  I looked for love, But love could not be found, Cause love is you.  I had you, I had love, I had fullness and I had life.  But you took your love, Gave it all away, Left me broken, hopeless, defeated.  Now in an empty bed, With empty thoughts and empty dreams, I live, if thats living at all.  I hear your voice, "I love you still," I hear you say, "Stronger and deeper then ever."  But your heart is in the hands of another, Though your heart beats for me, You can't break his to be with me.  "I can't live without his touch, his kiss," You say, I cry.  Tears fill my emptiness, I guess love doesn't find a way, Love is cruel and love hurts, I hurt.

      Perfection personified, Beauty in form. A face like that of an Angel. I see Heaven in her eyes, Sin on her lips. Beauty so awesome and absolute that she surely  could eclipse the brightness of the sun. Like the sun, she shines bright, Her smile could light the room ablaze, And melt the coldest heart. She has an air about her, unfitting her beauty, She is warm, caring, in a word, angelic. She has inpsired countless stories, poems, songs,  and paintings. Surely she will inspire countless more. For in her Heaven and Hell shine bright, In her is life, In her the world unfolds and its secrets revealed. She is your heart.

      Curse my heart,  For it has broken me. Flooded my cheeks with tears, Inflicted my chest with pain, Forced a hate so deep into me, Hatred for myself.  Not for me, but for who am I not. I hate me.  Not all the time,  Just now and then,  More now then, then. But, if only I had,  Had a love,  A kiss or a hug,  A warmth in my soul, A weekness in my knees, If only,  If only,  If only you.

      Tears, Tears paint my face, Pour from my eyes, Wash over me, And fall, gone from my face, my life, Like you now.  Yesterday, you were here, For ten years, you were here, For me, Always, My best friend, To you alone I cried.  Tears, Tears, I cry, to you, For you, Gone, but in my heart.  I see your eyes, Eyes full of understanding, Of love, of sadness yet happy still, I see the cute way in which you slept, I smile through the curtain of my tears.  I think of that day, You alone, I alone, You lying there shaking, Seizures sweeping over you, Helpless.  Now here I lie, Helpless, Helpless to stop these tears.

      All alone, as I've learned to be. Nothing but my thoughts as friends. Thoughts that turn to emotion, Of love, lost and not yet found, Of loneliness, of hurt, of guilt, Emotions that turn and boil within me, Boil and turn until they change, Change into tears, Tears which run my face.

      Day after day, Hour by hour, My Heart grows for you.  How do you do it? You're no longer here yet, I smile because of you.  I feel a warmth, deep down to my soul, I feel whole, I think I'm falling for you.  You let me fall, Chose not to catch me, Not to break my fall.  You watched me fall, Speaking only words that charmed my heart, Breaking my defenses.  Fall I did, Like a star from the sky, Burning and breaking for you.  Fuck you too.

      The movie "The Statement" is apparently based on a true story, but I didn't get that from watching it.  It seems like a movie that doesnt know what it wants to do with itself. It goes one way, then another and so on.  Michael Caine plays a Frenchman who ordered the murder of 7 Jews during WWII.  Because of this he is a war crimminal, but he was let go when he was caught, and pardoned at one point.  New charges against him surface, but he's been in hiding for decades.  Hidden in a collection of safe houses and monistaries.  Caine is a fantastic actor, and that is the case in this film. Were it not for him this movie would be a complete failure.  It's unclear who the real bad guy in the film is. Is it Caine? Is it some other group? Is it the church? Is it the Jews? Who the hell knows. At the end the movie is dedicated to the 7 Jews that were murdered and all the others in France that died as well, if that was there goal, a film for them, man did they screw up making it. But, Caine is good, like I said and because of that I give it 2 Lil Billy Connolly's outta 5.

       urlLink The Chronological Donald, Volume 1  comprises all of Donald's solo shorts from his debut in "The Wise Little Hen" in 1934 to Chef Donald in 1941.  Donald Duck has always been one of my favorite cartoon characters of all time and this set is like a treasure chest full of goodies.  Watching these shorts I started remembering them from the many times I watched them as a child.  I liked them then and I love them now.  The two disc set comes in a fancy looking tin case and comes with a certificate of authenticity.  It also includes a lil mini poster and some bonus features on the discs including a tribute to the man who provided Donalds voice for 50 years. This is a great set to have and may be a nice collectible down the line.  It gets a perfect 5 Lil Billy Connolly's outta 5.

      "Amores Perros" tells 3 interlinked stories of people from 3 different social classes.  The movie is heavy on story and is wonderfully made. Gonzalez Inarritu is a fantastic director.  I loved 21 grams and his short film Powder Keg was incredibly powerful.  All I really need to tell you is that the movie is good and that you should watch it. It gets an impressive 4 and a half Lil Billy Connolly's outta 5.

      Robert Altman is one of the greatest directors working today.  That being said, this film sucks.  It's the story of one girl basically (there are some small side stories) and when the movie starts out she's not a main dancer in the company.  Well someone gets hurt and she is thrust into a featured role. She does great. Next show comes along and she has about the same spot as a featured player.  She gets hurt. The end.  There is no struggle or scenes in which she's working her ass off and thinking about giving up.  The scenes with her bf don't have much depth.  When she falls and hurts herself, I did not care. When the movie ended shortly after I said "what the fuck?"  There were a few good points to the movie.  The dance scenes were filmed very well and they were interesting to watch. Also, there is some nudity to be had which helps saves the movie from a worse rating.  As it stands it comes in at a score of 2 and a half Lil Billy Connolly's outta 5.

       urlLink "Sahara"  stars the man for which my dog was named, Humphrey Bogart.  This film is one of only a handful of films made about the desert conflict in World War II and this is one of them. Interestingly enough it's actually a remake of another film that was set elsewhere.  As you can tell by the name of my dog, I'm a Bogart fan and he delivers a typical great performance here, one of his best. He leads a rag-tag bunch of guys, American and otherwise, through the desert in search of water and then against a group of evil Germans, by whom they are out numbered by about 10 to 1 or so.  The movie is not an over the top or super patriotic, America rules kinda movie.  It's a simple story about a group of soldiers and it's one fine movie. I think I shall deem it worthy of 4 and a half Lil Billy Connolly's out of 5. Go forth and watch it.

      Now when you hear the premise of Bubba Ho-Tep (a retirement aged Elvis, or a guy that thinks he's Elvis, and old black man who thinks he is JFK, take on an Egyptian Soul Sucker) you think, "Damn, this has got to be funny."  And you'd be right.  But not as right as you'd think, or at least I wasn't as right as I thought.  The movie is funny, but not as funny as I thought it would be.  In the case of this movie though, that's not a bad thing.  Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis are great as Elvis and JFK. I like to think that Bruce Campbell's character really was Elvis, he's too good an Elvis not to be. The film has most everything, comedy, action, drama and suspense.  It is highly recommended that you get the flick and watch it. You should enjoy it. It gets a Elvis worthy 4 Lil Billy Connolly's outta 5.

      I wasn't one of those people that thought Super Troopers was crap your pants funny.  It had some good laughs but the rest of the movie pulled it down.  Club Dread is much the same way.  Some good laughs and a lot of dead weight.  Some nice tits are thrown in, which helps, but even they can't help ease the weight of all the down time.  The movie takes place on an island run by a Jimmy Buffet wannabe. Drinks, fun, and sex are all thats on the menu in Club Paradise.  Sounds like a good time, until someone starts slashing people up.  Most everyone seems suspect at one point or another, until they turn up dead, or are attacked themselves. There are some really funny parts in the movie, such as when Coconut Pete is asked to play "Margaritaville" and he goes off about how his hit "Pina Colada-burg" came out seven years before "Margaritaville" and curses that evil Jimmy Buffet. (I may have spelt his last name wrong but I don't like the mans music so I don't care enough to look it up.) Overall it's an alright movie, could be alot better, but then again, could be a lot worth.  It weighs in at 2 and a half Lil Billy Connolly's.

      In Paycheck, Ben Affleck plays a reverse engineer.  I think this movie would hav ebeen better had they tried to reverse engineer themselves something, you know, good.  The movie isn't complete shit. It's not even all that bad for that matter. It's just not good.  There's a lot of promise in the story idea they took from Phillip K. Dick, but they don't do much with it. And somehow this reverse engineer guy knows all about kicking ass, driving a motorcycle like some kinda whacked out stuntman, and yet he still finds the time to fall in love. It's somewhat entertaining to watch for all its actiony goodness and Affleck is pretty good.  Overall I give it a total of 2 and a half Lil Billy Connolly's outta 5.

      "You're just mad cause today, you sucka's got served!"  Somewhere in America teens are shaking their booties in dance-offs with their "crews." Why this is happening? I don't know. Where? Again I don't know, otherwise I'd be down there watching them do their thing, cause its some funny shit. We need more street dancing, I often get the urge to drop to the ground and just start break dancing on the corner. Ok enough of that, the movie blows. It sucks. If the people in this movie could act half as well as they can dance it may be a better movie. Then again the plot is shit and is predictable, so even better actors might not help it. So in summary, the dancing is great (5 lil Billy Connolly's) the acting blows, the story is pathetic, overall it brings in a hefty 1 half of a lil Billy Connolly.

      The movie Ripley's Game is fair better then it's Direct To DVD status would lead you to believe.  The talented John Malkovich plays the part of Tom Ripley and does a damn fine job of doing so. I found his performance as Ripley much better then that of Matt Damons, though I did think Damon did a great job. This Ripley is an older Ripley, semi-retired I supposed you could say. The game the title refers to is the game of murder.  Ripley lures in a man and watches as he plays the game. There is a lot more to then that but I don't want to give much away cause there's no fun in that and we all know I'm lazy. The movie is very well made and very much worth seeing.  Being that as it is Ripley's Game receives a score of 4 out of 5 Lil Billy Connolly's.

      So the other day some guy comes up to the counter and he's got "The Bourne Identity" and "Spartan" along with a Rent 1 get one free coupon.  I look at the coupon and say, "sorry but this has expired." So he decides he only wants one movie and tells me to put "Spartan"  back.  Wrong move. Both movies are action type films.  One of them is very good and the other is a heaping pile of crap.  The good one is Spartan, you can guess the bad one.  Spartan stars Val Kilmer in a political/action/thriller that is very tightly made.  Unlike the Bourne Identity, this movie is well written, well acted, and finely crafted.  Val Kilmer is fantastic as the Special Ops agent ordered to get back the Presidents kipnapped daughter.  The movie isn't your typical action-thriller, thats part of what sets it apart. This is a fantastic movie and you should go watch it right away, or soon at the very least. It gets 4 lil Billy Connolly's outta 5.

      I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down to watch the Station Agent.  A friend had told me it was good but that's all I really knew about it.  Well my friend was right, the movie is good, very good.  The main character in the movie is a very simple and boring fella named Fin. Fin just happens to be a dwarf.  His main interest in life are trains, fake ones, real ones, books about em, movies with em, it don't matter as long its about trains.  He keeps to himself though.  Until he moves into the train depot and meets Joe and Olivia.  This movie is funny, moving and just flat out good.  There's a scene in which Fin sits in a crowded bar, alone and drinking, finally he stands up on his chair and yells "Here I am, take a look." It's amazing how cruel people can be and I rarely have thought about how hard it would be to be that short, despite the fact that my brother is a dwarf.  Do yourself a favor, watch this movie. It gets 4 and a half lil Billy Connolly's outta 5.

      The Rundown is just a good ole fashioned action movie.  Good fights, some decent one liners and explosions.  I must admit, while I'm not a wrestling fan, I do enjoy the Rock.  I didn't watch the Scorpion King or whatever it was, and  don't plan on it.  In this movie he is good and he's funny.  He's an action star I could get use to watching whenever I need a movie that I don't have to think too deeply about.  Here he is a retrival expert.  After taking down a football team he heads off to the jungle to get his boss's kid so he can get outta the game and go straight. Of course it's not gonna be that easy.  Lots of asses need kicking and things need to be blown up.  It's a good movie (note I said movie not film, there is a difference) and I enjoyed it.  For those reasons it gets a good 3 and a half lil Billy Connolly's outta 5.

      Tupac Resurrection is a documentary unlike most I've seen.  The film, directed by Lauren Lazin, uses Tupac to narrate the entire movie.  It's somewhat chilling to hear him talking about his death but, it gives the movie that much more of an impact.  I am not a big rap fan at all, and while I do like a few Tupac songs, I'm not a big Tupac fan either.  I think I may be a bigger one after watching this film though. You see all the ups and downs of the rapper through home movies, photos and of course his voice.  Even if you're not a rap fan or a Tupac fan I think most people would still enjoy this movie.  For that reason I'm gonna hook it up with 4 outta 5 lil Billy Connolly's.

      This movie should be called "The Big Flop" or "The Big Thud" well you get the idea.  Good cast, including a mustachioed Charlie Sheen but a shitty movie.  OK. Maybe shitty is a bit much. For its not a bad movie, its just very very dull.  And it lacks anything that makes one care about the movie or the people in it.  It bounces in with a score of 2 Lil Billy Connolly's outta 5.

      Someone was telling me Spiderman 2 is the second highest rated movie by critics this year.  That's insane.  Has everyone become mildly retarded? Or have movies just gotten that bad? Perhaps both.  Some background. I found the first Spiderman movie to blow. It was a crappy movie on many levels.  Spiderman 2 is much much better.  But thats like saying a sunburns better then being set on fire. Of course it is.  The dialogue is not this movie's strong point. It's very bad.  The action scenes are cool until you notice how fake Spiderman looks half the time, cause he's CGI.  When I see that, I'm taken outta the movie and the movie loses it's magic. Along with all the great reviews, people are crowning it the greatest comic book movie ever. I don't buy that either. I've now seen the movie twice and my opinion on it dropped even more after the second viewing.  It's not bad, but its far from great. I'd have to give it right around 3 outta 5 lil Billy Connolly's.

      So I see this DVD and I'm like, "Hmm, I haven't heard of this..." Matthew McConaughey, Gary Oldman, Kate Beckinsale, and the one and only Peter Dinklage, great cast I think. Then I see something that catches my eye, McConaughey's dwarf brother is played by Gary Oldman?!?!? Is this the same Gary Oldman? The 5'10 Gary Oldman? Yes.  This movie should be called Shittoes.  Everyone in the movie gives a decent performance, especially McConaughey and Dinklage.  However, Oldman is just ridiculous as the dwarf.  He looks awful. It's distracting, its insulting, there's no reason he should be playing that character. What's he going to do next? Throw on some black make up and play a black man? Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. It gets 1 out of 5 Lil Billy Connolly's.
