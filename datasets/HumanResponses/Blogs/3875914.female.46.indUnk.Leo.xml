      The deed is done.  It was so quick, I didn't even have time to haul out a tissue or shed a tear.  (Since I almost always cry at weddings, this was probably a blessing.)  The bride looked beautiful, the groom handsome and manly.  Can't think of two people who are better suited for one another.    Mazel Tov, kids!

      The owner of a golf course in Mississippi was confused about paying an invoice, so he decided to ask his secretary for some mathematical help. He called her into his office and said, "You graduated from the University of Mississippi and I need some help. If I were to give you $20,000, minus 14%, how much would you take off?"  The secretary thought a moment, then replied, "Everything but my earrings."  ***********************************************************************************************  A group of Mississippi friends went deer hunting and paired off in twos for the day. That night, one of the hunters returned alone, staggering under the weight of an eight-point buck. Where's Henry?" the others asked. Henry had a stroke of some kind. He's a couple of miles back up the  trail," the successful hunter replied. "You left Henry laying out there and carried the deer back?" they inquired.  "A tough call," nodded the hunter. "But I figured no one is going to steal Henry!"   ***********************************************************************************************  Regarding the year 2000, a senior at Mississippi State University was overheard saying "when the end of the world comes, I hope to be in Mississippi."  When asked why, he stated that everything happens here 20 years later than the rest of the civilized world.  ***********************************************************************************************  The young Mississippian came running into the store and said to his buddy, "Elmer, somebody just stole your pickup truck from the parking lot!" Elmer replied, "Did you see who it was?" The young Mississippian answered, "I couldn't tell, but I got the license number."  ***********************************************************************************************  NEWS FLASH! - Tunica, Mississippi----- Mississippi's worst air disaster occurred when a small two-seater Cessna 150 plane, piloted by two local Mississippi State students, crashed into a cemetery earlier today in Tunica. Tunica search and rescue workers have recovered 300 bodies so far and expect the number to climb as digging continues into the evening. The pilot and copilot survived and are helping in the recovery efforts.  ***********************************************************************************************  A Mississippi State trooper pulled over a pickup on highway 61. The trooper asked, "Got any ID?" The driver replied, "Bout whut?

      I've said it before and I'll say it again, I love reading  urlLink Acidman .  He's got an incredible knack for getting under the skin of his readers.  Sometimes in good ways, sometimes just the opposite -- but the man is certainly NEVER boring.  His blogdaughter sent him a test, and the  urlLink results  were hilarious -- and spot on.    (I'm not going anywhere NEAR that test if it's anywhere near as accurate as A-Man's results!) _____  Wanna know a secret?  My friends Brian and Pilar are getting married today!  I'm zipping over to their place to do Pilar's make-up, then we're off to City Hall.  I'm so excited.  I've never been to a City Hall wedding before.   _____  More later!

      (Okay, so I lied... er... got to busy to finish the story on time, so this was posted June 7th, 2004.  Needless to say, I caught HELL from some of Mom's friends!)  As I said before, my brother is going to kill us.  I know it.  He's uber-protective of my mom.  And she's smoke.  We have no idea where she is.  I'm dead, deader, deadest.  So is Blade.    I threw some money at Melissa, the bartender.  Making the ultimate sacrifice, I left a full glass of a decent cabernet on the bar and headed for the car.  A chorus of, "Your Mom is going to be fine" followed me out the door.  I had visions of Mom getting on the wrong train and ending up in Altoona, Iowa.  Mom passed out in some ladies room in a diabetic coma.   Mom being mugged and pushed off the train at any station other than her own.   Mom running off to Vegas with the conductor.   Mom being abducted by aliens.   (You get the picture.)   I jumped into the car and headed for Lake Shore Drive.  I got as far as Lawrence, and picked up the cell phone.  Maybe…    "Hello?"  "MOM??? You're HOME???"  "Well of course I'm home.  Where did you think I'd be?"  "I didn't know.  Blade didn't know.  How in the hell did you get home?"  "I called your sister and she came and got me."  "But Blade was THERE and he didn't see you."  "Blade WASN'T there."  "Yes, he was."  "No, he wasn't."  "Wait.  I've got to get a hold of Blade.  He's somewhere between Aurora and Route 59.  I'll call you back."  I pulled off at Irving Park and headed back towards Old St. Andrews, frantically dialing Blade's number.  "I'm sorry.  The number you're dialing is not in service."  SHIT!  I must have hit the redial button 15 times before Blade finally tried dialing me.  "You're not going to believe this…"  "WHAT?"  "Mom is home."  "WHAT???"  "She said you weren't there, and she called my sister."  "But I WAS there.  I was up and down that platform a dozen times trying to find her."  "Well, somehow or other you missed her.  But she's home and she's safe.  Why don't you head back that way?  By the way -- call Mom."  "You're right.  I don't believe it.  But I'm on my way.  And you BET I'm calling your mom."  I pulled into my usual parking space and headed back into St. Andrews.  Everyone started laughing, and pointed to my still-full glass sitting on the bar.  No sooner did I get my butt planted back on the stool than the phone rang again.  I bounced back up and headed out the door so I could hear.  "Les?"  "Mom?  What happened?  Blade was on the north side of the tracks waiting for you.  He was up and down the platform looking for you."  "Why would he do that?  Everyone always picks me up on the SOUTH side of the tracks."  "And this is the first time he's ever picked you up.  How was he supposed to know that?"  "Well I don't know.  Why didn't he come check on the south side of the tracks before he headed off into the night?  [Editorial note:  In retrospect, that's a dandy question.  I didn't think of it, either.]  I assumed that he'd pick me up on the south side."  "Mom, you know that when you assume you make an "ass" of "u" and "me".  "I guess you're right."  "But in any case, why didn't you call me?  You knew I had Blade's number."  "Oh.  I didn't think about that.  I just waited ten minutes, got fed up and then called your sister."  [Note the extraordinary patience.  She waited a whole 10 minutes.]  "And why didn't you call me as soon as you got home?"  "As a matter of fact, I had just walked in the door when you called."  "Fine.  Now you have to call Heidi and swear her to secrecy.  You know Keith will kill Blade and I if he ever finds out."  "Don't worry about that.  I'll just tell your brother that none of this would have happened if he'd just stayed home for the weekend."  Dissolve into gales of laughter at both ends of the phone line…  "Okay.  Gotta go Mom.  Love you lots."  "Love you, too."  Can I get that drink now?  P.S. -- Now I understand completely how parents feel when their kids don't show up by curfew.  Sheesh.  P.P.S. -- Keith hasn't said a word, but I have a feeling that sooner or later Blade and I are in for some serious ribbing...

      (Published June 2, 2004 in my old e-mail Omnibus)  The Mom Update (as promised yesterday):   The good new is that Mom is back from Florida, looking fabulous.  The bad news is that I lost her for a while this weekend.  How?  It's an interesting tale...  On Sunday, she and I joined Heidi and Fred for a cook out at Fred's parents.  (If they're Heidi's in-laws, does that make them my out-laws?  They're great people, in any case)  Despite the fact that, due to the unbelievable amount of rain we've been having, building an ark was becoming a temptation, we had a great time.  I stayed over at Mom's Sunday night.  Although Keith and Holly were up in Wisconsin at Holly's dad's place, Keith's friend Blade was visiting from Houston, TX and staying with Mom.  He took Mom and I to breakfast on Monday.  Mom was planning to come to my house in the city, and we decided that she'd drive in with me and take the train home.  Blade could then use Mom's car during the day.  He would then pick her up at the train station in Naperville.  (He lived in Naperville for a long time, and knows the area very well.)  Talking of trains lead Blade and I to laugh about the fact that he'd fallen asleep on the last Metra train home and missed his stop and ended up in Aurora (the last stop) more than once in the past, and that I've done the same on the Brown line and the Red line in the city.  We should have known better.  Blade then said he was trying to get a hold of his kids for dinner, but wasn't having any luck reaching them, so I invited him to join us in the city if that panned out.  Blade and I programmed each other's number into our cell phones so we could coordinate either him coming in to the city for dinner and driving Mom home, or picking her up at the station.  On that happy note, we parted company with Blade.  We had a glorious day in the city.  Got some decorating ideas for my place.  Did a LOT of therapeutic shopping.  Scored some great bargains.  Talked to Blade, and found he'd gotten in touch with his daughter and would be dining with her.  I told him that I'd be putting Mom on the 8:30 train that arrived Naperville at 9:30.  No problem.  Went out to Calo's, an old-fashioned, family style Italian restaurant for a great dinner and more wonderful conversation.  Did a little window shopping in the Andersonville area, which has changed a TON in the 15 years I've been living on the north side.  Finally hustled Mom into the car and headed off to Union Station.  Dropped her off at 8:10 p.m. -- PLENTY of time to buy a train ticket and board the train.  My last words to her before she headed down the escalator were, "Call me when you get home."  Right.  Thinking all was well with the world, I decided to stop at the Old St. Andrews Pub for a glass of wine before heading home.  Put my cell phone on the bar so that I'd hear it right away when Mom called.  Round about quarter to ten the phone rang.  It wasn't Mom, it was Blade.  "Leslie, did you put your mom on the 8:30 train?"    "Well, I didn't actually go down and put her on the train, but I left her at the station at 8:10.  Why?"   "I'm standing on the platform here in Naperville, and I didn't see your Mom get off.  I've been up and down the platform and she's not here."  "WHAT?????  You mean we LOST my MOM?"  Shit, shit, shit.  Panic, panic, panic.  My brother is out of town and my mother is lost.  He's gonna KILL me.  Then he's gonna kill Blade.  "Maybe she fell asleep on the train.  She didn't have a book with her to hold her attention.  Maybe she fell asleep."  "Do you suppose she got off at the wrong station?  Maybe she woke up and got off at Route 59?"   Much frantic discussion ensued.  Blade decided to head off to Route 59 to see if she was there.   The guy in the barstool to my right leaned over and said, "Your mother is fine, you'll see."  The couple to my right nodded in agreement.  I sipped my Cabernet and stared holes through my phone willing it to ring and have it be Mom on other end.  Nothing.  Shit, shit, shit.  Panic, panic, panic.  My brother is going to kill us.  Twenty minutes later, the phone rang again.  "Leslie, she's not at Route 59.  Where could she BE?"   "Well, if she fell asleep, she'll probably get all the way to Aurora and the conductor will wake her up."   "Shit."   "Yeah.  That, too."   Guess where Blade went next?  Uh huh.   "Leslie?"   "You're not going to believe this, but your mom's not here.  I talked to the conductor, and he doesn't recall seeing her on the train."  Ack!   "What are you going to do?"   "Go back to Route 59, and then back to Naperville, I guess.  What are YOU going to do?"   "Head for Union Station and start questioning anyone and everyone I can find, I guess."   "You know your brother's going to kill us, right?"   "Yep."   [Part II tomorrow…]

The government seizes both and provides you with milk.  You wait in line for hours to get it.  It is expensive and sour.  CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE  You have two cows.  You sell one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows.    DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE  You have two cows.  The government taxes you to the point you have to sell both to support a man in a foreign country who has only one cow, which was a gift from your government.  BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE  You have two cows.  The government takes them both, shoots one, milks the other, pays you for the milk, and then pours the milk down the drain.  AMERICAN CORPORATION  You have two cows.  You sell one, lease it back to yourself and do an IPO on the 2nd one.  You force the two cows to produce the milk of four cows. You are surprised when one cow drops dead. You spin an announcement to the analysts stating you have down sized and are reducing expenses.  Your stock goes up.  FRENCH CORPORATION  You have two cows.  You go on strike because you want three cows.  You go to lunch and drink wine.  Life is good.  JAPANESE CORPORATION  You have two cows.  You redesign them so they are one tenth the size of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk. They learn to travel on unbelievably crowded trains. Most are at the top of their class at cow school.    GERMAN CORPORATION  You have two cows.    You engineer them so they are all blond, drink lots of beer, give excellent quality milk, and run a hundred miles an hour. Unfortunately they also demand 13 weeks of vacation per year.  ITALIAN CORPORATION  You have two cows but you don't know where they are.  While ambling around, you see a beautiful woman.  You break for lunch.  Life is good.  RUSSIAN CORPORATION  You have two cows.  You have some vodka.  You count them and learn you have five cows. You have some more vodka.  You count them again and learn you have 42 cows.  The Mafia shows up and takes over however many cows you really have.    TALIBAN CORPORATION  You have all the cows in Afghanistan, which are two.  You don't milk them because you cannot touch any creature's private parts. Then you kill them and claim a US bomb blew them up while they were in the hospital.  IRAQI CORPORATION  You have two cows.  They go into hiding.  They send radio tapes of their mooing.  FLORIDA CORPORATION  You have a black cow and a brown cow.  Everyone votes for the best looking one.  Some of the people who like the brown one best, vote for the black one.  Some people vote for both.  Some people vote for neither.  Some people can't figure out how to vote at all.  Finally, a bunch of guys from out-of-state tell you which is the best looking cow.  CALIFORNIAN  You have a cow and a bull.  The bull is depressed.  It has spent its life living a lie. It goes away for two weeks.  It comes back after a taxpayer-paid sex-change operation. You now have two cows.  One makes milk; the other doesn't.  You try to sell the transgender cow.  Its lawyer sues you for discrimination.  You lose in court.  You sell the milk-generating cow to pay the damages.  You now have one rich, transgender, non-milk-producing cow. You change your business to beef. PETA pickets your farm. Jesse Jackson makes a speech in your driveway. Cruz Bustamante calls for higher farm taxes to help "working cows". Hillary Clinton calls for the nationalization of 1/7 of your farm "for the children".  Scharwzenager signs a law giving your farm to Mexico.  The L.A. Times quotes five anonymous cows claiming you groped their teats.  You declare bankruptcy and shut down all operations.  The cow starves to death.  The L.A. Times' analysis shows your business failure is Bush's fault.

       urlLink Denny  has the Monday Pun for Jan. _____  From my B-I-L Fred:  A brunette, a redhead, & a blonde all worked in the same office with the same female boss. Every day, they noticed their boss left work early. One day, the girls decided that when the boss left, they'd leave right behind her. After all, she never called in or came back to the office when she left early, so how was she to know?  The next day, they all three left right after the boss left. The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little gardening and went to bed early.  The redhead was elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the health club before meeting her dinner date.  The blonde was happy, happy, happy to be home, but when she got to the bedroom, she heard a muffled noise from inside. slowly, quietly, she cracked open the door and was mortified to see her husband in bed with her boss!

       urlLink This  post has yours truly banging her forehead against the steering wheel.  This isn't just a cultural divide -- we might as well be from alternate universes.

Right.  They are indeed aware.  They just don't care.  Boogie/Bogey Man thinks he's above the law.  Given that this is all happening in the California "justice" system, I'm not sure they're wrong.

A little old lady from North Carolina had worked in and around her family dairy farms since she was old enough to walk... with hours of hard work and little compensation. When canned Carnation Milk became available in grocery stores, she read an advertisement offering $5,000 for the best slogan/rhyme beginning with "Carnation Milk is best of all...." and she said, I know all about milk and dairy farms...I can do this!   She sent in her entry, and about a week later, a black limo drove up in front of her house... a man got out and said, "Carnation LOVED your entry so much, we are here to award you $1000, even though we will not be able to use it...."   Here is her entry:   Carnation milk is best of all,  no tits to pull, no hay to haul  no buckets to wash, no shit to pitch,  just poke a hole in the son-of-a-bitch!  _____

       Marian sent this little  urlLink test .&nbsp; I got all but one correct.&nbsp; How about you?    _____     I've offered Elizabeth a set of spare keys to the 'Bus, but I don't think she's ready to head off the e-  mail trail like yours truly.&nbsp; Anyway, she's shared another funny:     &nbsp;    A modern  day cowboy has spent many days crossing the desert without water.  &nbsp;  His horse has already died of thirst. He's crawling through the sand, certain that he has breathed his last, when all of a sudden, he sees an object sticking out of the sand several yards ahead of him. He crawls to the object, pulls it out of the sand, and discovers what looks to be an old brief case.&nbsp;     He opens it and out pops a genie. But this is no ordinary genie. She is wearing an Internal Revenue Service, ID badge and a dull gray dress. There's a calculator in her pocketbook. She has a pencil tucked behind one ear.   "Well, cowboy," says the genie... "You know how I work. You have three&nbsp; wishes."  &nbsp;  "I'm not falling for this." Says the man. "I'm not going to trust an IRS auditor genie."  &nbsp;  "What do you have to lose? You've got no transportation, and it looks like you're a goner anyway!"&nbsp;&nbsp;   The man thinks about this for a minute, and decides that the genie is right. "OK, I wish I were in a lush oasis with plenty of food and drink." ***POOF*** The cowboy finds himself in the most beautiful oasis he has ever seen. He is surrounded with jugs of wine and platters of delicacies.  &nbsp;  "OK, cowpoke, what's your second wish."   "My second wish is that I were rich beyond my wildest dreams." ***POOF*** The man finds himself surrounded by treasure chests filled with rare gold coins and precious gems.   "OK, cowpuncher, you have just one more wish. Better make it a good one!"   After thinking for a few minutes, the man says.. "I wish that no matter where I go, beautiful women will want and need me." ***POOF*** He is turned into a tampon.  &nbsp;  The moral of the story:&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government offers you anything, there's going to be a string attached.  _____

       I haven't blogged about   urlLink  this    and   urlLink  this follow-up    because so many other bloggers have, including   urlLink  Michelle      urlLink  Malkin   ,   urlLink  Rachel      urlLink  Lucas    and   urlLink  Professor Bainbridge   .&nbsp; But Sharon asked my opinion, so here goes:     &nbsp;   I understand the level of fear and concern generated by these articles.&nbsp; But did people not notice that:&nbsp; 1) there were Federal Marshalls on the Jacobsen's plane, and they were alert to what might or might not have been happening? and, 2) in both cases the people causing the alarm were detained and questioned?&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Yes, there are still bad guys out to get us.&nbsp; But maybe it's more helpful to quietly watch and learn than to create a scene that  would  be news in the media.&nbsp; Why should we be telling the bad guys just how much we know and just how closely we're watching them?&nbsp; (The media already does WAY too much of this, as far as I'm concerned.)     &nbsp;   In another blog earlier this week (can't remember which one), someone posed the question, "What would you have done in the same position?"&nbsp; My answer would have to be "nothing, unless the Marshalls asked."&nbsp; The Federal Marshalls and/or Air Marshalls were armed and aware.&nbsp; If someone had decided to play hero, it could have caused more problems than it solved and given the Marshalls less freedom to do what they needed to do.     &nbsp;   Does it bother me that Mr. Mineta ordered that airport screeners cannot pay attention when an unusual person or group of Middle Eastern extraction goes through security, but they  can  strip-search your grandma?&nbsp; You bet.&nbsp; My personal belief is that  any  unusual-looking group should get special screening attention.&nbsp; After all, we've had Taliban fighters who are as white as me, haven't we?&nbsp; And that&nbsp;Hispanic guy who was trying to make a dirty bomb? &nbsp;    &nbsp;   In Ms. Jacobsen's case, though, while this scares the pants off a lot of people, I actually find it comforting to know that our airport security system  is  working.&nbsp; Despite Mr. Mineta.    _____     Ah!&nbsp; You've gotta love those judges who  urlLink won't allow security screening ! &nbsp;  Gives me a warm, fuzzy, safe and secure&nbsp;feeling.    _____     &nbsp;    urlLink Kevin  has a different take on  urlLink security screening .&nbsp; But maybe that changed  urlLink after reading Annie Jacobsen's article , above.    _____

On seeing the two large matzoh balls floating in the broth, the Gentile man was hesitant to taste this strange looking brew.     &nbsp;   Gently the Jewish couple pressed the Gentile man. "Try it; if you don't like it, you don't have to finish it."     &nbsp;   Finally he agreed. He dug his spoon in, first picking up a small piece of matzoh ball with some soup in his spoon, and tasting it gingerly. The usual "Mmmmmmmmm" sound could be heard coming from deep within his chest, and he quickly finished the whole bowl. "That was good" the man said. "Can you eat any other parts of the matzoh?"    _____

        urlLink This  is a disturbing trend, but not an especially surprising one to me.&nbsp; The government has done a terrible job of funding military salaries.&nbsp; They'll spend a lot of money on hardware and ordnance, and very little on the people who use them.&nbsp; And, just as in business, there should be incentive pay based on skill level and bonuses paid based on battle time.&nbsp; I don't blame guys who have spent two decades putting their lives on the line for wanting significantly better benefits.&nbsp;    _____     When will the media stop calling  urlLink them  "militants" and start calling them what they really are -- terrorists?&nbsp; The Philippines did their allies no favors when they pulled out of Iraq.&nbsp;  urlLink See ?    _____      urlLink Sgt.

        urlLink Denny  sends the  urlLink Monday Pun .   _____   &nbsp;  Joy's dad sent me this one a while ago:    We challenge any so-called smart-ass Yankee to take this exam administered by the University of Arkansas Engineering Department  &nbsp;  1. Calculate the smallest limb diameter on a persimmon tree that will support a 10-pound possum.     2. Which of these cars will rust out the quickest when placed on blocks in your front yard? A '65 Ford Fairlane, a '69 Chevrolet Chevelle or a '64 Pontiac GTO.   3. If your uncle builds a still which operates at a capacity of 20 gallons of shine produced per hour, how many car radiators are required to condense the finished product?   4. A woodcutter has a chainsaw which operates at 2700 RPM. The density of the pine trees in the plot to be harvested is 470 per acre. The plot is 2.3 acres in size. The average tree diameter is 14 inches. How many Budweisers will be drunk before the trees are cut down?   5. If every old refrigerator in the state vented it's charge of R-12 simultaneously, what would be the percentage decrease in the ozone layer?   6. A front porch is constructed of 2x8 pine on 24-inch centers with a field rock foundation. The span is 8 feet and the porch length is 16 feet. The porch floor is 1-inch rough sawn pine. When the porch collapses, how many hound dogs will be killed?   7. A man owns a Tennessee house and 3.7 acres of land in a hollow with an average slope of 15%. The man has five children. Can each of his grown children place a mobile home on the man's land and still have enough property for their electric appliances to sit out on the front porch?   8. A 2-ton truck is overloaded and proceeding 900 yards down a steep slope on a secondary road at 45 MPH. The brakes fail. Given average traffic conditions on secondary roads, what is the probability that the truck will strike a vehicle with a muffler?   9. A coal mine operates a NFPA Class 1, Division 2 Hazardous Area. The mine employs 120 miners per shift. A gas warning is issued at the beginning of th 3rd shift. How many cartons of unfiltered Camels will be smoked during that shift?   10. At a reduction in the gene pool variability rate of 7.5% per generation, how long will it take a town which has been bypassed by the Interstate to breed a country-western singer?

       Two completely different perspectives, both, ummm,  interesting:        &nbsp;   First,  urlLink Wind Rider  has a suggestion for a  urlLink mascot  for the Democratic National Convention.     &nbsp;   Second, my friend Deborah sends this little ditty on why it's tough to be a Republican:     It is very tough to be a Republican in 2004, because somehow you have to believe concurrently that:     1. Jesus loves you, but shares your deep hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.   2. The United States should get out of the United Nations, but our highest national priority is enforcing UN resolutions against Iraq.   3. Standing Tall for America means firing your workers and moving their jobs to India.   4. A woman cannot be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multinational corporations can make decisions affecting all humankind without regulation.   5. Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.   6. The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches, while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.   7. Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins, unless you someday run for Governor of California as a Republican.   8. If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.   9. A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, but then demand their cooperation and money.   10. HMOs and insurance companies make huge profits and have the interest of the public at heart.  &nbsp;  11. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.   12. Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.   13. It is okay that the Bush family's Carlisle Group has done millions of dollars of business with the Bin Laden family.   14. Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him and Rumsfeld reassured him he was our buddy, a bad buy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him, but then a bad buy again when Bush junior needed a prop for his re-election campaign as the War President.   15. A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. A president lying about WMD existence to enlist support for an unprovoked, undeclared war and occupation, in which thousands of soldiers and civilians die, is, somehow, solid defense policy in a War against Terrorism.   16. Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which should include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.   17. The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's Harken Oil stock trade should be sealed in his Daddy's library, and is none of our business.   18. What Bill Clinton or John Kerry did in the 1960s was of vital national interest but what Bush did in the 80's is irrelevant.   19. Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.   20. Affirmative Action is wrong, but it is OK for your Daddy and his friends (here and in Saudi Arabia) to get you to graduate from Yale without studying much, to bail out your companies (Harken Oil and the Texas Rangers), and to get the Governorship of Texas.   21. You are a conservative, but it is OK to spend like there is no tomorrow and run up deficits that your grandchildren will have to pay, while at the same time refunding as much tax money as possible to rich people who do not need it.   Contemplating these illogical paradoxes can take a toll on a healthy mind. So if a friend of yours has been acting a bit dazed and confused lately, be nice: he or she may be a Republican.  _____   &nbsp;   Not to be outdone, my buddy Donna sends:   &nbsp;   The 2004 Democratic National Convention -- Official Program&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;6:00pm - Opening flag burning ceremony.  &nbsp;&nbsp;6:05pm - Pledge of Allegiance to the United Nations  &nbsp; 6:10pm - Secular words by Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton  &nbsp;&nbsp;6:30pm - Anti-war concert by Barbra Streisand  &nbsp;&nbsp;6:45pm - Ted Kennedy proposes a toast  &nbsp;&nbsp;7:00pm - Tribute theme to France  &nbsp;&nbsp;7:10pm - Collect offerings for al-Zawahri defense fund  &nbsp;&nbsp;7:30pm - Tribute theme to Germany  &nbsp;&nbsp;7:45pm - Anti-war rally moderated by Michael Moore  &nbsp;&nbsp;8:25pm - Ted Kennedy proposes a toast  &nbsp;&nbsp;8:30pm - Terrorist appeasement workshop  &nbsp;&nbsp;9:00pm - Gay marriage ceremony for male and female couples  &nbsp; 9:30pm - CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN urge defeat of President Bush  10:00pm - Posting the Iraqi Colors by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins  10:10pm - Reenactment of Kerry's fake medal toss  10:20pm - Cameo by Dean 'Yeeearrrrrrrg!'  10:30pm - Abortion demonstration by N.A.R.A.L.  10:40pm - Ted Kennedy proposes a toast  10:50pm - Special thanks to the New York Times &amp; Washington Post  11:00pm - Multiple gay marriage ceremony for threesomes and groups  11:15pm - Maximizing Welfare workshop  11:30pm - Saddam Legal Defense Fund pep rally  11:50pm - Ted Kennedy proposes a toast  12:00pm - Nomination of Democratic candidate  NEW: 5:00am -Ted Kennedy will conduct a swimming class &nbsp;    [In the interest of being fair and balanced, Donna promises to send the Republican schedule when she gets it.]

       Meghan sent this not-to-be-missed story of women and public rest rooms:    &nbsp;  My mother was a fanatic about public bathrooms. When I was a little girl, she'd take me into the stall, teach me to wad up toilet paper and wipe the seat. Then, she'd carefully lay strips of toilet paper to cover the seat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, she'd instruct, "Never, NEVER sit on a public toilet seat. Then she'd demonstrate "The Stance," which consisted of balancing over the toilet in a sitting position without actually letting any of your flesh make contact with the toilet seat. By this time, I'd have wet down my leg and we'd have to go home to change my clothes.    &nbsp;  Even now, in my more "mature years, "The Stance" is excruciatingly difficult to maintain, especially when one's bladder is full.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  When you have to "go" in a public bathroom, you usually find a line of of women that makes you think there's a half-price sale on Nelly's underwear in&nbsp; there. So, you wait and smile politely at all the other ladies, who are also&nbsp; crossing their legs and smiling politely. You get closer and check for feet under the stall doors. Every one is occupied. Finally, a door opens and you dash in, nearly knocking down the woman leaving the stall.     &nbsp;  You get in to find the door won't latch. It doesn't matter. The dispenser for the new fangled "seat covers" (invented by someone's Mom, no doubt) is handy, but empty.&nbsp; You would hang your purse on the door hook if there was one - but there isn't - so you carefully but quickly hang it around your neck (mom would turn over in her grave&nbsp; if you put it on the FLOOR!), yank down your pants, and assume "The Stance."    &nbsp;  Ahhhh, relief. More relief. But then your thighs begin to shake. You'd love to sit down but you certainly hadn't taken time to wipe the seat or lay toilet paper on it, so you hold "The Stance" as your thighs experience a quake that would register an eight on the Richter scale. To take your mind off of your trembling thighs, you reach for what you discover to be the empty toilet paper dispenser. In your mind, you can hear your mother's voice saying, "Honey, if! you would have tried to clean the seat, you would have KNOWN there was no toilet paper!"    &nbsp;  Your thighs shake more. You remember the tiny tissue that you blew your nose on yesterday - the one that's still in your purse. That would have to do.&nbsp; You crumple it in the puffiest way possible. It is still smaller than your thumbnail. Someone pushes open your stall door because the latch doesn't work.&nbsp; The door hits your purse, which is hanging around your neck in front of your chest, and you and your purse topple backwardagainst the tank of the toilet. "Occupied!" you scream, as you reach for the door, dropping your precious, tiny, crumpled tissue in a puddle, and sliding down, directly onto the insidious toilet seat. You bolt up quickly, knowing all too well that it's too late.&nbsp; Your bare bottom has made contact with every imaginable germ and life form on the uncovered seat because You never laid down toilet paper - not that there was any, even if you had taken time to try. You know that your mother would be utterly ashamed of you if she knew, because you're certain that her bare bottom never touched a public toilet seat because, frankly, dear, "You just don't KNOW what kind of diseases you could get."    &nbsp;  By this time, the automatic sensor on the back of the toilet is soconfused that it flushes, sending up a stream of water akin to a fountain that suddenly sucks everything down with such force that you grab onto the toilet paper dispenser for fear of being dragged off to China.At that point, you give up.&nbsp; You're soaked by the splashing water. You're exhausted. You try to wipe with a gum wrapper you found in your pocket, then slink out inconspicuously to the sinks.&nbsp; You can't figure out how to operate the faucets with the automatic sensors, so you wipe your hands with spit and a dry paper towel and walk past a line of women, still waiting, cross-legged and, at this point, no longer able to smile politely.    &nbsp;  One kind soul at the very end of the line points out that you are trailing a piece of toilet paper on your shoe as long as the Mississippi River!&nbsp; (Where was it when you NEEDED it??) You yank the paper from your shoe, plunk it the woman's hand and tell her warmly, "Here, you just might need this."    &nbsp;  As you exit, you spot your hubby, who has since entered, used and exited the men's restroom and read a copy of War and Peace while waiting for you. Annoyed, he asks, "What took you so long, and why is your purse hanging around your neck?"    &nbsp;  This is dedicated to women everywhere who have ever had to deal with a public restroom (rest??? you've got to be kidding!!).&nbsp; It finally explains to the men what really does take us so long. It also answers their other commonly asked question about why women go to the restroom in pairs. It's so the other woman can hold the door and hand you Kleenex under the door.   _____

       There are two people I'd like to say good-bye to today:  This   urlLink  wonderful little girl   , who touched many, many people.  And my friend Victor, whose funeral I attended Monday.       Victor was a pain in the ass... and my pal.  I met Vic through my   urlLink  cat club    (yes, cat club). He'd been a member of Lincoln State for a long time before I joined, but he welcomed me warmly... then set me to work. For the past several years he's been our Show Manager -- a thankless, miserable job that's comparable to herding cats on horseback for an entire year at a time. Our club is a not-for-profit, with members from Illinois and Wisconsin (and at one point, also from Indiana). A group of about 12-20 members at any given time. Volunteers, one and all. A most unlikely army, but Vic was always up to the task.  Why? Well, Vic was one of the most organized people I ever met. He juggled membership in a number of cat clubs (besides LSCC), showing his own cats several weekends a month, maintaining a   urlLink  cattery   , running a family, and running his own business. I think the reason he was so good at it is that, like a good general, he was great at giving orders no one would dare to disobey. Not family, not friends, and certainly not volunteers. Yes, he liked to be in charge.  For example, because of Vic, I've been on television (local access cable and three different regular networks) and three different radio shows over the last several years. Why? As Vic put it, "Nobody else is willing to do it. You're too stupid to be scared, and persistent enough to be effective at getting us publicity on the air." Yep. That was my pal. But, as crazy as he could make you with fourteen billion phone calls a day asking if you'd completed your latest assignment yet, he was always great at saying "thank-you" and "well done" when you did something right.  Although I have not shown at all recently, I spent a lot of weekends at cat shows with Vic over the years. He was the first breeder to plop a   urlLink  Somali    in my hands to show me the   urlLink  finer points    of the breed. And when I needed someone to agent my   urlLink  Devon Rex    champion, Peanut, at a show up in Milwaukee, Vic was the first to volunteer. (Of course, he came to regret that choice. Peanut took a power dump -- as only a Devon can do -- in her carrier on the trip home. Vic said he and Pam spent the last 50 miles of the trip with their heads stuck out the windows of the Suburban. Heh!)       Vic also knew a bazillion people in the cat fancy, and he introduced me to many judges, clerks and breeders/exhibitors from all over the U.S. I made many, many good friends because of him.  Nobody liked a good dinner out like Vic. His favorite place of all time was Harvey's Prime Rib in Clarendon Hills. But anywhere that had good prime rib and great cocktails was alright with him. Being diabetic, he was supposed to be careful with his diet... but anyone who traveled to shows will tell you the most frequent words out of his mouth were "Don't tell Pam" as he was about to indulge in another naughty no-no. Show night Saturdays were special, indeed.      As opinionated and pushy as Vic could be, one of the most endearing things about him was his absolute blindness to color, creed or sexual preference. He looked straight into your heart and based his friendships on what he saw there alone. His friends saw that right away. As far as Vic was concerned, anyone who didn't get it didn't matter.      The other thing people always understood about him, whether they liked him or not, was that he adored his wife, kids and grandchild. Family was first. No question.      Beloved husband, father and grandfather, respected architect and pain-in-the-ass pal. I miss him already. I can't imagine what it will be like to hold a club meeting without him. I  do  know that he's over the   urlLink  Rainbow Bridge    with pets and friends who went on before him. And I'll take some comfort in that.   _____

       From Elizabeth: Jesus in the Bathroom      A Sunday school teacher of pre-schoolers was concerned that his students might be a little confused about Jesus Christ. He wanted to make sure they understood that the birth of Jesus occurred a long time ago, that he grew up, etc. So he asked his class, "Where is Jesus?"      Steven raised his hand and said, "He's in heaven!"      Mary was called on and answered, "He's in my heart!"      Little Johnny, waving his hand furiously, blurted out, "I know! I know! He's in our bathroom!"      The whole class got very quiet, looked at the teacher, and waited for a response. The teacher was completely at a loss for a few very long seconds. He finally gathered his wits and asked Little Johnny how he knew this.      Little Johnny replied, "Well, every morning my father gets up, bangs on the bathroom door, and yells: 'Jesus Christ, are you still in there?'"   _____      And The Retirement Package    The Navy found they had too many officers and decided tooffer an early retirement bonus. They promised any officer who volunteered for retirement a bonus of $1,000 for every inchmeasured in a straight line between any two points in his body. The officer got to choose what those two points would be.       The first officer who accepted, asked that he be measured from the top of his head to the tip of his toes. He was measured at six feet and walked out with a bonus of $72,000.       The second officer who accepted was a little smarter and asked to be measured from the tip of his outstretched hands to his toes. He walked out with $96,000.       The third one was a non officer grizzly old Chief who, when asked where he would like to be measured replied, "from the tip of my penis to my testicles." It was suggested by the pension man that he might want to reconsider, explaining about the nice big checks the previous two officers had received. But the old Chief insisted and they decided to go along with him, providing the measurement was taken by a medical officer. The medical officer arrived and instructed the Chief to "drop em," which he did. The medical officer placed the tape measure on the tip of the Chief's penis and began to work back. "My God!" he suddenly exclaimed, "Where are your testicles?"       The old Chief calmly replied . . "Vietnam ".   _____

She currently works in the Intensive Care Unit of a large Metropolitan Hospital. However, she is not permitted to answer the telephone while she is at work. It simply caused too much confusion when she would answer the phone and say: "Picabo, ICU." (Thanks, Deborah!) _____  Elizabeth sends this little ditty:  A guy gets a new dog, a nice Jewish dog. He names the dog Einstein and trains Einstein to do a couple of tricks. He can't wait to show Einstein off to his neighbor. A few weeks later when the neighbor finally comes over, the guy calls Einstein into the house, bragging about how smart he is. The dog quickly comes running and stands looking up at his master, tail wagging excitedly, mouth open, tongue hanging out, eyes bright with anticipation. The guy points to the newspaper on the couch and commands "Fetch!"  Immediately, the dog climbs onto the couch and sits, his tail wagging furiously. Then all of a sudden, he stops. His doggie smile disappears. He starts to frown and puts on a sour face. Looking up at his master, he whines, "You think this is easy, wagging my tail all the time? Oy vey .. And you think it's easy eating that junk that you call designer dog food? Forget it ... it's too salty and it gives me gas. It's disgusting I tell you!"  The neighbor is absolutely amazed ... stunned. In astonishment, he says, "I can't believe it. Einstein can speak. Your dog actually talks. You asked him to fetch the newspaper and he is sitting on the sofa talking to us."  "I know, I know," says the dog owner. "He's not yet fully trained. He thought I said kvetch." _____     And this funny story: LIVING YOUR REDNECK DREAMS!    True Story............    Larry Walters is among the relatively few who have actually turned their dreams into reality. His story is true, though you may find it hard to believe.    Larry was a truck driver, but his lifelong dream was to fly. When he graduated from high school, he joined the Air Force in hopes of becoming a pilot. Unfortunately, poor eyesight disqualified him. So when he finally left the service, he had to satisfy himself with watching others fly the fighter jets that crisscrossed the skies over his backyard. As he sat there in his lawn chair, he dreamed about the magic of flying.    Then one day, Larry Walters got an idea. He went down to the local Army-Navy surplus store and bought a tank of helium and forty-five weather balloons. These were not your brightly colored party balloons, these were heave-duty spheres measuring more than four feet across when fully inflated. Back in his yard, Larry used straps to attach the balloons to his lawn chair, the kind you might have in your own back yard.    He anchored the chair to the bumper of his jeep and inflated the balloons with helium. Then he packed some sandwiches and drinks and loaded a BB gun, figuring he could pop a few of those balloons when it was time to return to earth.His preparations complete, Larry Walters sat in his chair and cut the anchoring cord. His plan was to lazily float back down to terra firma. But things didn't quite work out that way.    When Larry cut the cord, he didn't float lazily up; he shot up as if fired from a cannon! Nor did he go up a couple hundred feet. He climbed and climbed until he finally leveled off at eleven thousand feet! At that height, he could hardly risk deflating any of the balloons, lest he unbalance the load and really experience flying! So he stayed up there, sailing around for fourteen hours, totally at a loss as to how to get down.    Eventually, Larry drifted into the approach corridor for Los Angeles International Airport. A Pan Am pilot radioed the tower about passing a guy in a lawn chair at eleven thousand feet with a gun in his lap. (Now there's a conversation I'd have given anything to have heard!)    LAX is right on the ocean, and you may know that at nightfall, the winds on the coast begin to change. So, as dusk fell, Larry began drifting out to sea.    At that point, the Navy dispatched a helicopter to rescue him. But the rescue team had a hard time getting to him, because the draft from their propeller kept pushing his homemade contraption farther and farther away. Eventually they were able to hover over him and drop a rescue line with which they gradually hauled him back to earth.    As soon as Larry hit the ground, he was arrested. But as he was being led away in handcuffs, a television reported called out, "Mr. Walters, why'd you do it?"    Larry stopped, eyed the man, then replied nonchalantly, "A man can't just sit around."     _____

Then vaccinate, dammit!   _____     urlLink Paul has a PSA , too. Anyone who's ever tried to comfort a crying child will appreciate this. And my brother will, just because of the subject.   _____

It's about time NASA got this one right!   _____    It's almost  urlLink nap time  for Spirit and Opportunity.

I can't imagine putting my vision at risk for the sake of fashion.   _____     urlLink This  is good news.

To quote Peter, Paul &amp; Mary:   "When will they ever learn? Oh, when will they ever learn?"   _____

       Can you say "  urlLink  right-threaded wingnut   "??? I listened to his acceptance speech, and this is one SCARY guy. He's probably good pals with Jerry Falwell. At one point during his speech, he reminded me distinctly of a far right-wing Howard Dean.       Obama has politely asked Keyes to stick to the issues and avoid character assassination. Even as far to the left as he is, Obama is looking better and better to me all the time.   _____      I'm as concerned with character as I am with the issues this year.  urlLink This  bothers me. Does that mean I don't think that Bush has prevaricated? No. That's a part of politics sometimes. But why bring something up that you know is fact-checkable and totally untrue? I'm truly stumped here.   _____

       Wouldn't you think  urlLink this  would be pretty damned obvious? For goodness sakes, cell phone distraction is bad enough. My guess is those DVD players will be installed in the dashboards of many a future Darwin Award winner.   _____
