      Lately the whole thing has been the same.. .same routine: wake up, school, homework, bed, weekend... yeah i am real bored like always.. living this dull life. even if you see me and it looks like im having a great time, im not.. like i go somewhere and i look at something, i just dont care, just leave it there.. i have something missing in my life. and i dont know yet.. maybe i do but im just afraid to go and get it. something is stopping me.. no one takes me seriously anymore... its hard to change my image or not be me for a day, without breaking the silence. seriousness in me, no one will see. i guess im just the funny stupid one who had no feeling at all.. im indifferent, apathetic, no emotion. life has too much drama that i just want to put aside and see the world how it is.. maybe this is the real world and it is all this bullshit. i know i sound like a television but yeah sometimes i think ill wake up but i know i wont. this dream is something i cannot escape. here i am listening to my music talking about something that no one will ever hear me say.. there will read this and say, this is not chris, or chris dont sound like this... my life is is dead already, but im still living

      It's 2:14 so I guess this counts as a new day. Well "yesterday" was a shorted day. Andro and me went around  Eagle Rock and I discovered some roads that I haven't been on before. So yeah. I hate my love life right now. I mean I keep thinking I have this chance with this girl, but she flirts with every guy. So I dont know what to think anymore. And I'm saying after all the signals I've got from her, she shouldn't be doing that, unless we just have a friendly bond as friends. It's just confusing because sometimes she would say "I love you," but then she doesn't act like it. I know she trust me to go with her places, to do things for her, and other stuff. Maybe shes just using me as a bitch or something. I mean I do love her. I tried telling her that through a CD I made her, but it only lasted a little while. I have come to the conclusion that she doesn't like me. If you like someone you would have respect for them. Though she has no respect for me. She punces me, hits me, socks me, hurts me. I guess I shouldn't even try next time. I was asleep awhile ago and she IMed me and said, "your ignoring me on purpose." I am so glad I was asleep, I don't want to be apart of her games anymore. I am just going to stop liking her someway or another. I won't stare at her anymore in math class or anything, won't laugh at her jokes even though it might be funny, or I won't do anything.

Yes the sun arose from the dead and gave me everlasting heat today. I kept sticking arm and head out the window on the cardrive home. Well yeah, i wish school can be like today. And i have decided i am going to wear my shorts to school tomorrow. :D

      Today was the day after the mercury incident. A student of the eight grade brought with him some mercury to school with him in the morning. Little did he know that people can die of mercury if shallowed and other things. In my second period, a classmate of mine had found some mercury on the floor. My science teacher said to sit away and immediately called the attendence office. From the science class, we had to move up to the football field and continue our work there, while the room get clean.  i have touched some of the mercury but hadnt taken any with me to any classes. but yeah i could be poisoned. after i learned what mercury could do to a person, i started worrying. though my other teachers said that you can only get affected if you drank lots of amounts of it. woot thank goodness.. well that day, the liberal arts building in the school was shut down due to mercury in the classroom and hallways. Today, classes in the room, like mine, would had to go to the library where we would stay far away from the poisonous substance. In the library for science, some guy came in and asked us if we were wearing the same shoes as yesterday. i said yes with a couple of other people and we had to get our shoes inspected for mercury.. man we had a lot of mercury on our shoes. they had this device that measured the mercury, kinda like a metal detector. if a student had a lot, they would have to get their shoes cleaned. blah  blah.. i had my shoes cleaned and it took a long time. i missed nutrition, but i managed to get some food.. woot.  well today i socked jonathan on the head which felt real good. i gave him a good bleeding on the leg with a kick which made me really happy. and yeah things with me and reina havent been going well. well she socked me today and i didnt want to talk to her at all. that way she would know i am trying to be serious and that i dont like her socking me. i dunno. well yeah im bored.. blah blah

      I have realize something better doing, than making people look stupid with their own words. Making people smile, with my words, gifts, actions, and more, are better than that. Knowing that someone is having a good time in their life because I have been there. I try to do good deeds for friends, and be romantic for her. and I do. And when I do, I get a smile. There are some things in life living for, and this is one of it. Others are like; family; friends; and some, I did not discover yet. Give kind, and recieve it. Thats why I'm saying now-a-days. No one likes to be punched out of respect from the person. Everyone wants respect even if you deny it. Though me, people know be as out-going, and sometimes miss my respect by a mile and think I don't care about what they say. I have tried to change the wt I go about things, comment things, use things, but I always fail and go back to the same me. Maybe there is no change me, unless I have to discover more life lessons to change my ways. I don't know if this idea of making people smile will ever stick with me. I mean people have their moods and I know I have em.  I have a school mood which is my out-going-kind-of-person, and then there is my life lessons, I'm so in love, lets write in a journal person. And when both moods cross, its kinda weird. And I have seen it been weird by the comments I GET from people.

      Well yeah. I was talking to her today and she said she would come to my house on monday, which is tomorrow. I told her i wanted to meet her at the bottom of the hill instead. Though the subject changed quick. It came back up again. I asked her what she was doing tomorrow, and she said her friend was gonna come over. She asked me why i asked, and I said i wanted to take a walk with her. And then it happened. She said she would blow off her friend and come with me. But i know her for a long time and still i dont even know if she was joking or not. I mean she signed off right in my face without us finishing our conversation. I am kinda having a feeling that something good might come. But these feelings come up too often and they pass too quick. So i dont even know what to believe anymore. Like I said, she flirts with everyone. Though i dont think she even likes me, ANYMORE. We used to be so so so so close together. Like as if we were bf and gf. It didnt even matter if it wasn't the real thing, it was life the real thing, though no one has to get the permission to break away. Im just wasting my life dedicating time to someone who won't do the same thing back. Well i can wait till tomorrow, or should i mean today.. it is 1:39, which means it is monday. Ill call her in the morning and see what comes up. I really want to be alone with her, just for at least 30 minutes, that is NOT at school rounds. hand out. yenno what i mean. i mean i only se her during school, so this is my chance. I have a while week, the whole spring break to dig, or do something, and find out the facts i need to come to my last conclusion.

      Today I woke up with the sun shining into my room. It felt great and it is very rare that the sun would be up in 6 o'clock in the morning. Though it was a hot day, today was pretty cool. Justine does like the touching. HAHA. I knew it. Shes a horny. Today during lunch, I got a little crazy with my shoulder action. I went to Chris Epps house and Darwin came. We had fun playing basketball and baseball, then we went to Kurt's house across the street. Kurt is getting a swimming pool which is very cool. If I had lighter skin, I would swim a lot. Though me in water for a long period of time equals dark dark. I want to make a website, but its so hard finding a website. Websites are fun to make. And aww shit. I just forgot about the contest on shadowness. FUCK. The winner gets a year long account of uploading anything like music, html files, and all kinds of shit. Man the dead line was on CINCO DE MAYO. Damn Mexican destractions.

      Yeah I can last without her. And yet, people now know of my "angry" side. If you do something to me, I will take my revenge. I didn't mind them taking my wallet and playing monkey in the middle, but looking in it, supposively taking my money, and dropping the contents of it really got me pissed. I was never good at saying sorry, and I'm still not. So I guess I'll just let this problem hang. Her and her buddies in math are so immature. I mean I do jokes and stuff, but saying nipple out loud in math class isn't really funny. They are like the only ones laughing. Lately I'm just trying to get the respect of people. I got a lot of respect right now, but there are still a lot of people who just think they can boss me around because I play along with comments, or being very quiet. Having multiple personalites are a tuffy.

      . . . I once said, that her last impression was bad, but little did I know, it wasn't. I thought that me, Christopher Paguio, would have to wait all the way to next school year to hear her beautiful voice. She calls me, and even though I don't pick up, she takes the time to leave a message. A message that made me smile, a  real  smile, a smile that I haven't had since school ended. . . . In the past, I said to myself, that I would never fall for her again. It's just impossible to not do that. Just to take this chance everytime with her is worth it, even though the outcome may not be the best. She broke my hearts many time with her flirt-a-licous personality, and I always hid my jealousy. But now it's different. School is over, and seeing her through the summer can put away her seductive words closed, but open to me.

      I think I am too emo for life. I am just sitting here listening to the Copeland soundtrack, thinking about me in the future. Just a while ago I was thinking that I would never want to grow up. Like I mean I've been thinking about me, living without my parents money. I would be worrying about those taxes, those payments, those responsibilities. Well, part of me is saying that I shouldn't be worrying about whats in the future, and I should be concentrating on the present. And the other part of me, is just, afraid. I don't know. too much drama in my life. Too many heartbreaks. I love emotions, and emotions love me. I just don't know what to do. I want to master life, I want the best out of life. I am afraid of dying. I afraid of where I will go after I die. I wonder to myself if I am doing good, or bad. I want to do good. hmm. maybe I should think this whole thing over. til next time.

      Hmm.. Sad topic is: Break Up My sister's boyfriend broke up with her yesterday. Of course she really loved him. I thought he was cool. He came over to our house once in a while, and even came to church with us. He bonded good with our family. I hate to see my sister cry. I mean yeah you know you don't like to see a family member of yours cry. I knew she felt bad and she didnt go to school that day. I wanted to cheer her up, but i didn't know what to say. she will find a new boyfriend, we all know it.
