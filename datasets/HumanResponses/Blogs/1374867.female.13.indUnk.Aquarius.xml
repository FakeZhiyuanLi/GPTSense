      HI! Anyways, I'll print this for my essay today. I will put my essay on here right now.             The Making of an Internet Journal                          By: Gabby Banzon        The internet has changed the lives of billions of people. It gives information about almost anything, has games, and ways of communicating. Like, through e-mail, chatting, and through, something not everyone has seen an internet journal.  Most people don’t even know what it is. Except, for a lot people of my own culture.       An online journal, also known as a blog, is your basic journal. Except, online with dates and times when you posted it. You can type things and put pictures on it. Everyone can look at it. So, I wouldn’t put private things on it if I were you. With an online journal you can send like messages to people in a certain way. Just tell them to check your internet journal/ blog and they can see your message. It is a really cool thing to have. I have one myself.       There are two ways to make an internet journal/ blog. I’ll show you the easiest way. Go online to www.blogspot.com. There will be a box in the middle of the box. Type in what your base website name will be. Then, click next or continue. If your     base name was already taken then think of another one and type it in. Then, click next or continue. There will be text boxes to type in a username and password for you. Click continue, if your username is taken enter a different one. Later, there will be two text boxes. Type in your title, like my blog or something. Then, type in a description or what your blog has in it, click continue.        After that, choose if you want to have a new blog (which is something you have to pay for) or the regular, click continue. Later, click on the box beside the thing that says I agree to the terms of service, click continue.       Then, click on the box that you want for your background and click continue. There will be an edit your blog box, type and add pictures on it. Then, click post and publish on the top. Now, check your website!       Now, I have taught you how to make an internet journal/ blog. You can show it to your friends and they can see your messages. Now, you have your very own blog. If you want to see mine check out www.angelg2392.blogspot.com.

       Everytime I get and "A" on my math tests i have to help kids who got a "B" to "F" on their test to help them get better at math. So I am kinda like a mentor. so...... I get good grades.when I get good grades I get a couple steps closer from finishing math. I hate math.so In order to stop math I get good grades. I am a math mentor who hates math

      A chat i had today with Noel. To understand it read this. It is a post noel put up on hiz xanga. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ok, whenever im at UNF im always wandering around after or before classes, mainly because i like to find out whats up or what not around the place. So today i was doing the same routine and decided to check out this one building near the computer lab, dont know exactly what building it was tho (...i guess this explains why i always look lost)      i was eating some good food right before i was entering the building, and as i slowly opened the glass door some girl walks right by me, and starts starring me down (starring me down to the bone!..no joke!).. i thought she was a student worker trying to get me introuble for eating in the building (even though i know u can eat in certain buildings), panicing, i try to avoid her stare and try to by pass her while looking for a nearby trash can. To my luck i find a three foot tall ash tray (usually these ash trays have freaking trash cans attached to the sides) but i wasnt able to find the usual trash can hole to dispose my food. I was pretty much analyzing the structure of this mysterious ash tray, hoping that i would be able to find the common side trash hole, all in the midst of this girl just starring at me. After 30 seconds of me lookin like an ass studying the ash tray, and panicing in front of unknown girl starring at me, she finally breaks the silence and asks, "excuse me....but, where are you coming from?" in my head i started to freak out! i was thinking, did i break a UNF law? am i gonna get sued for having trespassed this building? are they gonna report me for studying an ash tray? SURE curiosity killed the cat, but you dont see me with whiskers (unless i dont shave) purring my way through the night...so after having a mental breakdown, i simply answered, "Im from here...jacksonville, its extremely nearby" and then she says "oh no, im sorry, i mean... ur nationality..." so then i was like omg, is this a fantasy come true? ...back to my point, i answer "im filipino..." and with excitement she says "oh wow but you dont look like it!" and in my head i was like, "whats that suppose to mean? not interested in me nemore just cuz im filipino?" its like she gave me a compliment that i dont look filipino...so is it a bad thing to look filipino? or is it a good thing to not look filipino? anywho i took it lightly, and just started conversating with her, and she seemed pretty nice...in the bigger picture i thought it was pretty cool that some random stranger took the oppurtunity to get to know me...  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  AnGeL G 2392: heylo wngx3: hey hey! wngx3: thanx for the commeny wngx3: comment* AnGeL G 2392: :-D AnGeL G 2392: well dat wuz a funny post wngx3: hahahah wngx3: what was funny about it?

But yesterday he made the highlight of my day! every time duren lunch this principal helper person, who'z named  Dr. Grogan, has trivia question time. so she asks"wut's my real first name and how do u spell it?" so Hazan goes up and says " DOCTOR!

He had his hood over his head..i could see his red nose..and tears droppen on da floor...Now when ppol are sad..i get sad. When all da popular crowd got away from him i went with my frend to..i dunno..comfort him i guess. So, I jus sat there with him. but then my teacher came out so..since his head was da only thing i could i kinda patted his head and left. herez a chat we had today...um i can't copy it suz i'm on AIM express. SRY yall. P.S HAZAN? i'll be there for u when u need me..u were there when i needed sum1 to talk to.

While my friend was teaching a lesson (it wuz a project)  we were doing a worksheet. all of a sudden we heard a little yap and a kid yelling because a little dog was chasing him. All of us went to see what was going on. (btw, my class was in a portable that period because i'm in a smart class, hehe) then we went back to our seats becuz the dog ran away. Then, while my teacher was walking in we heard a very big bark. my teacher goes, well that definetly isn't the other dog! So we went to look agen.  there was a GERMAN SHEPARD outside! sumthin wuz wrong with its back to legs. NEways, we were looking at the dog when two kids were walking and saw it. they were like just staring at it..slowly walking away. We went back inside and my teacher had some water..so she put it in a cup a let the dog drrink it. after the dog drank some it ran away. i hope those dogs r safe now.there not wild though..they had collars.

When ur in middle kewl u kinda hav to change. u noe? drop ur old habits and games which r stupid. I jus don't wanna be that young, stupid, pushover girl NEmore.

      okay so the test about me will be in 10 days so i will count down..okay? * It appears that I am the real OFFICIAL leader of KFC and I have to do like bible trivia and drawing..but its all good * Yesterday i nearly got ditention for sitting down  after running a mile. HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO RUN A MILE AND NOT SIT DOWN FOR 5 MINUTES!!! i have asthma for crying out loud. and you know what my coach said? "It was your choice to walk slowly and not finish the mile...AND now your only choice left is to walk. and you expect for you to be able to sit down and do nothing.? WELL NO!!!" (at this point i am trying to figure out why i didn't tell him that i have asthma and don't have my inhaler because I usually don't use it anymore. AND that i DID try my best i just drank too much water and my stomach was hurting. ALSO i have asthma too! :D) So yea thats what happened. -gabberz  9 dayz

Thay didn't want to leave MRS. Boothe. She was the nicest PSR teacher EVER. I'll miss her BUNCHES! I mean... I've been in her PSR class for 3 years. SHe almost went to tears after class.  Heres the speech she made:                                                          Some people in this class have been in my class for 3 years.

      How can summer be so boring? It's supposed to be fun. Oh I know why its so boring. My best friend is going to Ohio for 2 weeks.And I'm left with a friend and an evil suck up ex-friend...name= rebecca. She think she's so good at everything, when ALSO she thinks that I think that I'M so good at everything. for example...  * Yesterday- Here's our conversation  Rebecca's little sister, "guess what gabby, I'm going to play the saxaphone for band." Me, "cool!" Rebecca, " Why don't you teach her, since  your   so   good  at it." Me,"Hey, I never said that I was  so   good  at playing my saxaphone." and I'm thinking..EVEN though I was the  only  girl to get master musician award last year.  Rebecca,"What evvvar"  ME,"That's like saying...Why don't  YOU  teach her violin? Since  YOUR  so good at it.  rebecca rolls her eyes at me.  I walk home.   She is so stuck up now. ggrrrr....

      It has occured to me (today and many times before) that I have SO MANY kuya's and ate's but I NEVER call them kuya or ate. Plus there are SO MANY kids who call me ate. like this, "Ate gabby!!! watch me!!!!" or "Ate Gabby, PLAY WITH ME!!!" It gets really annoying at times. I mean.it's really odd. I know I should...but they don't care. I'm so wierd..THAT'S THE ONLY TIME I'M ADMITING THAT!  Anyways, I have nothing to say.  -gabberz  (I did not steal gabberz from donnerz. donna stole it from me...i think. Claire cochell made that nickname up for me.)

      I'm going to the YFC conference..YAY!!! The only reason why i'm going is because the macaranas' are going too. 60 dayz till conference..i think.     Anyways, I was looking at my signature bok from the last day of school. I didn't have a yearbook because My mom didn't want to buy one. The last day of school was TOTAL randomness. I mean this one guy, who is like a total skateboarder punk person was sitting down at his desk. Then I laugh at something that somebody says. Then he yells out to me, "I LIKE YOUR LAUGH, GABBY" and then everybody stares at him and then at me. my face was a mix of what-the-crap, uuuuhhh-oKAY, and stop-staring-at-me.And then during yearbook signing i get the band CD from my band teacher and we use the boom box to play it in the rotunda. So we play it and put it to full volume and u can BARELY hear it. You had to be atleast 1 foot away to here it. And then the kids from band are start agueing about who made the song good or bad. Like.."the saxaphones were to loud","the drums make the song REALLY cool","clarinets were to soft!", or"TUBA'S SUCK!!". And i was like" SHUT UP EVERYBODY! YOUR DROWNING JOEY'S SOLO OUT!" (joey is a really cool and very good drummer dude who is gonna be a freshman next year. Too bad we can't hear his solo's anymore)  Anyways, I guess that I'm making u really bored -gabberz

      I was just watching  On-Air with Ryan Seacrest .    Ryan Seacrest is actually REALLY cool. I Love is last name. Seacrest.....I would love to have that last name. I also love his hair...its so cool, standing up and all over the place, with highlights. HE's actually pretty funny, too. HE ran in this like torch lighting thing for the olympics. He looked REALLY stupid        ANYWAYS, about the show. It had WILLIAM HUNG on it. he sang we are the champions. It was bad, even though his voice improved.         ALSO, it had Tom Papa. HE's a very funny comedian, with his on show. I watch it last week. it's called  Come to Papa .  -gabberz

That is one of my best drawings, it just got messed up cause of the computer.  Oh and I took a harry potter quiz (Gosh, I'm stupid)....look what i got.   Cool, you're a Gryffindor! Brave, noble, and chivalrous, you stick up for your friends and morals. Full of heart, youd rather die than be dishonored. You are generally outgoing, popular, and optimistic. Your house usually has an excellent Quidditch team and often wins the House Cup. Famous Gryffindors are Godric Gryffindor, Albus Dumbledore, and Harry Potter. You rock!

      Things that I learned or occured to me during or at a party after the Eucharistic congress. *PRayer can really save your life. We prayed a couple of minutes before this one incident....my little brother was almost hit by a bus, luckily my dad jumped and grabbed him while the bus was slowing down. *Laptop mouses can really bug you. *If you just talk to people who stop by your boothe...you can really influence people to join CFC/ urlLink YFC *We really didn't need the presentation *Chastity is a good thing to learn about. It's good to have a funny person (who can sound exactly like beevus and butthead) to talk about it.  *Prayer is an awsome power. *Shoopow(sp?) RULES!! *It's boring to have a person talk to you about how they thought they were a loser, but they really weren't because they made themselve's think that they were losers. *Jugglers who talk about god a funny and cool. * urlLink Charlie  always wears long sleeves...what's he hiding? *Anthony is called Fresh....I wonder why. *If I go to an afternoon mass after some type of activity, I fall alseep during the homily, but wake up after the homily. *Never stick a Q-tip in your ear if it's water logged. It just makes it worse. *Be thankful to have auntie's who where the same size as you. (My auntie's are small) YOu never know if they might have a spare bathing suit for you to borrow.  -gabberz

Anyways, I was watching the bloopers....and these guys are REALLY funny! I mean i was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt.   Anyways, heres a little test that I took. and here are the results.

      Here are some stuff that has happened lately. *My dad banned me from watching  Friends . He's getting sick of me watching it everyday. I can't help it, it's my favorite show!   *I caught a fish while fishing at this place, next to my tito's house. I gave the fish to my little cousin. WEll he's not my cousin, but i think of him as my cousin. *After fishing, I played volleyball(with one of those plastic bounce balls, also without a net)with my tita Kherstyn(sp?), tito alan, and tito gerard. It suprised me that i was better than my tita kherstyn.It also suprised me that, how my tita's and tito's act like ate's and kuya's, instead of like..well, you should know what i mean. They're like 15 years older than me, but they seem like they're like 5 years older. Anyways, Tita Kherstyn and I lost by one point.

      Okay so its   DAY 2    So, I had to wake up at 7 and i was REALLY tired since i talked to Noel, raffy, and kristine until 12.    Anyways, I was only scheduled for the morning shift, but Ate chi made me a standby for all of the shifts and so i was in all shifts. So, i was a co leader of the Reuben tribe ages 10-12. and i was a co leader with this girl name kristine...NOT kristine from tampa. So like, i met everybody in my group and it turned oust that there was this girl nicknamed BOGAR..not booger..BOGAR . She's wierd. Anyways, This CFC person as like, okay kids, YOU HAVE TO CALL YOUR tribe leader ATE OR KUYA. and i was like...you don't have to call me ate since i'm like your age. so we had to make these stupid visors. and we used like rubber bands that felt like sand paper cloth to tie the ends together. of course..i didn't make one. later, we had snacks and this girl(aubrey) in my group said that her stomach didn't feel good. It turned out that this cherry kool-aid stuff that she drank, tasted disgusting and  it made her throw up. I'll skip the other stupid stuff and go to the next shift.     This shift i was leader of the Joseph group. these girls were 7-9. and they were like so obediant. they followed EVERY thing that they were told to do. So they colored stars on sheets of cloth. and during my next shift, they get to stuff them. ok so..NEXT SHIFT     Next shift, I was placed back into REUBEN group. and i got to sow BUGAR's pillow since she wasn't there that night. I got to stuff it then. and i stayed there till like 11pm.      DAY 3  I wen to mass and went to the kids watch. I was placed in REUBEn tribe again. and we sang songs(like we did the day before) and went out on the BIG porch area and played that egg on spoon game... except it wasn't an egg, it was a ball. then we just did whatever and I sowed aubreys pillow since she wasn't there and i got to keep it. IT IS SO PRETTY! And I got a hat that says YFC on it.  I'll talk about my trip to corpus christi with macy and her family tomorrow

      Okay, so I'm back from San Antonio.10th CFC USA conference!   DAY 1  So, like RIGHT when I got there...there were people like coming towards us(me and my parents..duh). And I was like...who are these people?!? and I turned out that they were people from chicago that I TOTALLY forgot about. well maybe not totally, but I barely remember them. They were one of friends parents and some old people that I never talked to before.   So, I got to my room and imediatly(sp?) went downstairs. I went downstairs while being in an elevator with some old friends that I didn't even remember. So, I got out of the elvator and looked for noel... I saw a guy that looked like him, but I wasn't sure....so I went into the conference room thingy, and found my parents. While sitting down, The girls from the elevator came up to me...and here's our conv. Nique:Gabby? me:Yea...do i know you? NIque:think....KFC illinois Me:WAit....I know you..but I dont know you. Nique: It's me nique....and macy's upstairs. Me:Macy? o wait your sister....OMG!!! your sister! HOw's is she..and how's christian? wait...CHRISTIAN!! HOw's he?!? Is he here?!? CAuse his parents are here...i saw them in the lobby, when I checked in. Nique:WHoa..slow down. Christian isn't here, but macy does have a crush on him.And SHUT UP! *FYI Macy is 12 and christian is 12 and we are long lost friends* okay..enough about the conv....it gets boring.    okay so like I went to a YFC pep rally for the conference. The last one before the conference. IT was like I was at the last day of conference all over again. I had that funny feeling in my arm..like god programmed my nerves to put my arm up. So like..i did. after the songs, we prayed the rosary for the G4G. WE have like 16 states left..i think. So after the rosary, some CFC person said that they needed help with KFC. Thus, I became a tribe leader for the REUBEN tribe. and the wierd thing was that the reuben tribe had kids ages 10-12. so like half the kids were my age.    after the rally, i saw noel. I talked to him,kristine, and raffy. I found out sumthing REALLY COOL!Kristine used to live in a neighborhood RIGHT next to mine, she used to go to my middle school(Taylor Road MS), AND she used to have one of my treachers(Ms. Striby).that's like FREEAAKKYY!!  I'll right about day 2 and maybe other days tomorrow. -Gabberz

I went on a boat and my aunt&nbsp;told me a funny story: Okay so, my  urlLink uncle ted  and uncle don were like just bored or something, so like they had this crazy idea. They were like, LETS JUMP IN THE RIVER. and like that river is like BLAH. so they did, and when they got in, they're like... AAHHH!!! It was cold and had fishy's. and they were scared cause they thought there were sharks in there. and they got on the boat, cold and freaked out. haha.     &nbsp;   okay, end of story. anyways, on tuesday night i went to watch Spiderman 2. IT's TOTALLY awsome. It's my new favorite movie!    and today, we went to Long Island Beach. The water was FREEZING cold and the waves were SO big. perfect weather for sufers and boogie boarders. But i don'  t have a surfboard ( i do know how to surf) and i didn't bring my boogie board. Thus, i body surfed. I got knocked over 6 times by  HUMONGOUS  waves. But it was still fun. okay well i g2g.     &nbsp;   -gabberz
