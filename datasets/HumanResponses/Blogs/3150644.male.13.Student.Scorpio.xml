      I'm so lame that I am philosophising about the lameness of this post and the lameness of this blog. Aren't I lame.  That's so lame.  L-A-M-E. Lame!

      A lot of people are saying the previous post is lame.  ?_?  I was not trying to be sarcastic or anything, I really like that model. Pilot is my fav brand for pens, and G-Tec is my fav pen frm Pilot.   RELATED INFO:    Colours user has for G-Tec-C4:  Dark Blue, Green, Red (used for school of course).  Started using:  Primary 5, 11 years old.   Fav highlighter brand:  Stablio (is that how you spell it?)

      Argh.  This is the second time Sean has spoilt my pen. My precious  G-Tec-C4  Pilot Pen.  There are two ways a G-Tec pen can spoil. Sean did it the first way. The nib is pshed all the way in, making it hard to write. Another way is that the nib bends about 60 degrees. Either way the quality of the pen is compromised, or the pen is unable to write at all.  And I don't want to throwit away, I'll try to use it till the ink runs out, or I'll feel guily dat I did not preserve nature's resources, and also that I did not preserve my money. Of course I'll be lucky if it cannot work, or I'll have to throw it away without guilt.   FACTFILE: Pilot G-Tec-C4    Length of nib:  0.4mm  Cost:  abt S$3.00 for pen, abt S$2.00 for refill. (simple math shows that the plastic costs abt S$1.00 meaning the plastic is of high quality, in tandem with the high quality ink.)  Ink quality:  High  Type:  Cap  Colours avaliable: Dark Blue, Red, Green, Black, Light Blue, Purple, Pink, + more  User comments:  I am happy as I am able to write very well with it. It is smooth, does not smudge, and can be used for quite a long time. When writing with it, I found myself much neater. However, nib gets easily spoilt, and cap becomes loose after a long time. Try not to drop it a lot of times.  &copyCopyright jeremi.fact

      Today I stayed back to practice drill for the Guard of Honour thing for speech day. As usual, Herman was there. Though making us laugh a few times, he did not crack so much jokes this time - you could tell he wanted to get a job done quickly.  This is the first time we practiced with rain - and the first time we practiced that we did not sweat at all.  After the thing some sec2s went to play basketball. I did not get much chances to shoot =( but it was fun anyway. I got quite a few wounds from that game. it was rough, ya, but then my most serious wound came from when I fell and tripped on the tiles while going to get the ball. Abrasion.  Well that was all for that nice afternoon...

      hahaz, got to miss school today.  there's this thing called peer group advisor when they pull you in bcos they assume you understand these young crime commiting juveniles better then they do. 2day we got a sample of how it was like in the juvenile court, and well, since it happens in the morning, we missed school. Sad, a history test was postponed.  Ya, and we also had to wear long sleeve white shirts and black long pants - starcy stuff - felt quite formal suddenly.  Other people there include my classmates Lester and Koganti, Darel and Wenhui from 3K, Roderick, senior frm BB and Daniel, fellow squad member, frm BB too. (his surname's Pflug!). Teachers were like Mr Oh and Mrs Raj.  We ate at Macs after that and we wrote our reflections there too.

      Yesterday was my church's anniversary. Coincidentally, it was also on my sister's birthday.  One thing that stayed in my mind was the song  When you believe  from  Prince of Egypt , which was sung by the youth choir. Using my tremendously powerful fingers, I highlight, copy, and paste.   When you believe    Many night's we've prayed  With no proof anyone could hear  In our hearts a hopeful song  We barely understood,  Now we are not afraid  Although we know there's much to fear  We were moving mountains  long before we knew we could   Chorus: There can be miracles  When you believe  Though hope is frail  It's hard to kill  Who knows what miracles  You can achieve  When you believe  Somehow you will  You will when you believe   In this time of fear  When prayer so often proved in vain  Hope seemed like the summer birds  Too swiftly flown away  Yet now I'm standing here  With heart so full I can't explain  Seeking faith and speaking words  I never thought I'd say   Chorus There can be miracles  When you believe  All hope is frail  Its hard to kill  Who knows what miracles  You can achieve When you believe  Somehow you will  You will when you believe   A-shir-ra la-do-nai ki ga-oh ga-oh  (I will sing to the lord for he has triumphed gloriously)  A-shir-ra la-do-nai ki ga-oh ga-oh  (I will sing to the lord for he has triumphed gloriously)  Mi-cha-mo-cha ba-elim adonai  (Who is like You, oh Lord, among the celestial)  Mi-ka-mo-cha ne-dar-ba-ko-desh  (Who is like You, majestic in holiness)  Na-chi-tah v'-chas-d'-cha am zu ga-al-ta  (In Your Love, You lead the people You redeemed)  Na-chi-tah v'-chas-d'-cha am zu ga-al-ta  (In Your Love, You lead the people You redeemed)  A-shi-ra, a-shi-ra, A-shi-ra.......   Chorus There can be miracles  When you believe  Though hope is frail  Its hard to kill  Who knows what miracles  You can achieve  When you believe  Somehow you will  Now you will  You will when you believe......   You will when you believe

      Teachers can be interesting, weird, lame, or funny.   Quote 1:  A science teacher who falls under these four categories(I won't state names, but she hates durians) had a peculiar msn display name.  "When you're good to mama, mama's good to you"   Quote 2:  Now, here is my math teacher who from speed/time graphs ended up talking about the definition of accelaration in math compared to science, and concluded saying something like:   "Science teachers are redundant, and Math teachers are short and simple!"  LOL. Talk about symbolism.    Archived quote:  My math teacher again, talking about the formula of y=mx+c in relation to graphs, and he said something like "and when you do this and this...   ...the y-intercept will pop up like a baby!"   &copy jeremi.record

      With my Gmail, people have been "begging" me for invites over MSN Messenger, and one of those I am sad to mention is my IT Club chairman. Well, he is just like the others.  When I tell them I cannot send invites, they ask me how I got mine. I try to ward them off by giving them clues, but they come back again, just like a guy whose name starts with L and ends with R.  So to all you people, please stop asking.   G is for Getting irritating...

      I just learned today that the QD in the new N-Gage QD stands for  "quaque die", which is "everyday" in Latin. Latin is a dead language,  thus it can be used for scientific names, mottos, and sympolic  meanings. Here is a Latin phrase you should know; if you don't, then  learn it.    Nil Sine Labore  [neelsee-naeler-bor-rae]  Latin for "Nothing Without Labour". Used as a motto for  urlLink Victoria School  and  urlLink Victoria Junior College . Used a  personal maxim by most Victorians.   ©Copyright jeremi.define

      Yesterday was the VIP open house. I went there not so keen at first, but walked away determined to get myself into this wonderful programme.   Reason 1:  VIP suddenly seemed the right programme for me after the briefing on the system of learning and the style of education. I also found some of the rooms quite cool. The system sounds so unique and unlike the normal curriculum   Reason 2:  The teachers gave us a surprise. We went there, surprised to find Mr Koh as one of the organisers, and Mrs Jay and Mrs Lai advocating the subjects of literature and math. Life in VS GEP would be not as lively without these teachers that have taught me.   Brief Program that day.  8:30 am to 9 am:  Registration and collection of handouts 9 to 10 am:  Talk by Mrs Chan and Key Personnel on VIP Curriculum and admission procedures 10 am to 12 noon:  Open House.  An opportunity to have lesson previews, interact with teachers teaching VIP etc.  Actually I also met a few of my friends, about 4 from Dunman and 1 from Nanyang.

      Yesterday was speech day. After more than a  month of ardous training, the day finally came. Rahul even thought at first that our speech day GOH drill itself was a rehearsal. That is how hard it is to tell the difference.  I'm quite sad. The two people in my line are Jordan and Weiting, who for some reason keeps on getting screamed at by Herman.  Here's what happened on Saturday:   Morning -  had bible quiz training b4 the drill.  L8 morning -  drill practice, drill practice, drill practice.  Lunch -  Leonard predicted that it could have been komala (is that how you spell it?) but instead it was  pieces of meat and vegetable in between two pieces of bread in a styrofoam box  in which the general idea of the compliments can be summarised into the word "rotten".  Afternoon -  THE TIME HAS COME. we thus showed our superior drill to the inferior mortals of the other uniform groups.  Over -  as we marched away, a certain man called Herman was seen walking with two plastic bags. Upon further observation, they were Sausage McMuffins, and 2nd Company plundered the lot. Bwahahahaha.  So that was it. *.*   Coming up:   Top Ten Tips  to remember for smart drill (i.e. BB drill)  01.Make sure your uniform is straight, starched, and the right colour. 02.Polish those boots. Fire and water methods, and definitely not instant shine. 03.Belt - a little brasso is enough. Rubbing is the key.  04.Make sure all badges are present, all in the right position, and not crooked (nametag too) 05.A hollow boot makes the most noise.  06.Straighten your elbow. (Herman used a method - hold two blue cups while marching. Argh) 07.Lock your arms. 08.Make sure that when you raise your leg, it is at 90 degrees. 09. Always "stand straight, chins up, chest out", have a sharp jerk of head when taking dressing, sharp turning during whatever  pu-sing , etc. 10.Remember to keep in line (Quote:"It is very easy to see how you are not in line from far away!" - Herman)  Extra Special Tip: 11. Get Herman as your instructor.
