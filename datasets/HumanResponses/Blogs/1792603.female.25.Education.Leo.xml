        LOATHE ME  091803  If I Let myself get close to you A requisite you will be to me. If I am too contingent, Mislay will I, the faculty to be alone, To function on my own, Bungling to survive without you Weak will I be, vacillating, irresolute. Then I Must spurn propinquity, Must secede myself from you, careless, For I will need to be certain, So not to pine for you heftily, If mislaid you will be.  Loathe me. Be repulsed by me For I am being me.   Should I,  Be implicated to you, then I shun you. As I accept as true,  I am not within acceptable limits  For you to be enthralled to me. If I am not attracted to you, For certain will I be unperturbed, forthcoming as I am not anxious, For always will I be before the one I am not rapt to.  Loathe me. Be repulsed by me For I am being me.   If I diverge from you, I miss what I clinch with you. I heave closer. If I need you, I am feeble. I hate myself for being feeble. I resent you for making me feeble. I distance myself from you.  Loathe me. Be repulsed by me For I am being me.   Go on, tell me what you want. But constrained will I feel to conform what you want. When I feel proscribed,  Scrawny, inadequate, do I feel inside Not the least bit can I give you what you stipulate for, devoid of feeling piqued. Convey me your feelings, Then I must do what you want, That would meddle with what I want. So, I do not want to heed your feelings.  Loathe me. Be repulsed by me For I am being me.   Should I be where I want to be, I would by no means be impotent, weak, tired, afraid, inadequate,  But I am. Therefore, I feel inadequate.	 I must fail to disclose my feelings, So you would not find out how flawed I really am. Lie. I live a lie.  Loathe me. Be repulsed by me For I, yes I, Love you, But I am being me.

      A FIGMENT OF MY IMAGINATION  sumbody rocked my world last night... and he's not drunk. too bad i was. pero sane enough to feel that he's feeling sumthin too.   pero so uncanny...people would do such things just to put across their concealed sentiments...  like...  buying "the event" tickets for both of us. so britney. it's a total turn-off. but he didnt do that.  benevolent enough for those pimple-causing chocolats... for that extra 20lbs and lovehandles. but that he didnt do too.   instead...  he said a short prayer... pronouncing his desire for a ceaseless warm relationship for both of us.   too pious?  no. i am pipe-dreaming. HEHE. cloud-cuckoo-land.  wake up u.. u...@#$%^&*# daydreamer!!!!!  its a chimera.  ERR....look at what 4 bottles of beer can do.

      	Alang pasok sa trabaho dahil sa ulan.  Posible kaya yun? Kahit bumagyo ng palaka sa Pilipinas ay di mo aakalaing magagawa palang mag declare ng eskwelahang pinapasukan ko ng ganito. Kung iisipin mong isususpinde ang pasok dahil San Fernando, Pampanga ka pa nanggagaling, na kung saan iihi lang ang bayawak ay aabot-tuhod na ang tubig ulan, samahan pa ng floating ataul na galing Sto Tomas, mangarap ka.  	Geographically, ang Pampanga ay nasa bahaging gitna ng Region III. Kung iisipin mo ay madali itong maapektuhan ng bagyo na magmumula sa Norte sa dahilang kapatagan ang mas malawak na bahagi nito. Kumbaga ay walang barriers. Ang di ko lubos-maisip ay kung bakit umakyat na ng # 3 ang signal sa Tarlac, Bataan, at Maynila, ay sing perpekto pa rin ng bola ng roll-on deodorant ang pagka zero ng  signal dito sa Pampanga. Paalala: Pa encore na ang concert ng mga palaka sa likod ng bahay namin at di pa nauuwi ang tatay ko dahil siguradong bising-bisi siyang nag-aantay ng mekaniko-on-the-road.   	Pero iba ngayon. Salamat sa signal #2 ni Onyok na sa tingin ko ay sa panaginip lamang nangyayari. Ang sarap ng pakiramdan ng habang nagmamadali kang magbihis sa kaumagahan upang hindi maging cause of delay ng school bus (na lagi namang cause of delay) ay biglang isisiyok ng celphone ko ang die-another-day kong alert tone para sa text message na magsasabing walang pasok. Saya no? Hindi rin.   	Oo mas gusto ko na yung walang pasok sa meron. Papayag akong ipatapon ako sa Alcatraz kung sasabihin mong ayaw mo. Plastik ka kung ganun. Lalo na kung kakatapos pa lang ng nakaka tigang sa utak at walang kamatayang taunang Selebrasyon ng Buwan ng Lahi sa school. Obligahan ka ba namang magturo at tumugtog ng sandamakmak na awiting  Pilipino sa lahat ng mga estudyante ng grade school sa loob ng isang linggo, habang inaantay ka sa kabilang building dahil may isang klase ng grade 2 na nawala sa pag-iisip kong papasukan ko pala. Minsan, pasusuutin na lang ako ng jester costume, iisiping mong pwede ako sa circus. Marunong pala ‘kong mag juggle.   	Ang mga di-pangkaraniwang mga araw na ito ay para na ring pagtakas mula sa isang mapanggamit na halimaw ng trabaho. Pero di yun ang point. Meron ding disadvantages yung pagkakaroon ng aksidenteng bakasyon. Bukod sa bubungad sa mga mata mo ang gabundok na pinagkainan sa lababo na nung nakaraang gabi pa nakatambak sa lababo, mag ta-transform din sa mala-Himalayas sa taas ang tambak ng gawain mo sa carel o table mo sa office. Asa ka pa na lalapit ang co-teacher mo sa iyo at sasabihing “di ako busy, mag vo-volunteer akong gawin ang work mo.” Parang sinabi mo na ring kaakit-akit ang Ilog Pasig at di ka nanunuod ng Meteor Garden.  	Ah, oo nga pala. Wala rin palang ibang sisisihin kung bakit maluha-luha ako ngayon sa harap ng mga plato sa lababo. Ipagsigawan ba  naman na walang pasok sa buong kabahayan. Di umubra ang powers ng nunal sa paa at kagitingan ng dila ngayon sa mga magulang.  	Pero ayos lang. Ang 20 minutes na gugugulin mo sa paghuhugas ng mga balugang kaldero at ang close-to-eternity na pakikipag bunong-braso mo sa mga nakapending mong trabaho ay walang kwenta, kung ikukumpara sa pansumandaling pagtakas sa kamandag ng burn-out at pagkakaroon ng kapanatagan ng loob at pansariling kapayapaan. And World Peace. I thank you.

      this was my result from the "what kind of  kiss are u?" test. i hope sumbody would find it very interesting. buwarharharhar!!!    You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Sometimes, the Best Things You Write, You Write by Mistake    Several of my most reproduced pieces came from rants I posted on The Sinukwan Gazette that I had no intention of ever publishing beyond that paper. I was posting on the fly, as part of a written conversation. Unencumbered by an "editor head," I got something out of me that I may not have otherwise. Keeping a journal of your thoughts on anything (not just the mundane details of your so-called life), or engaging in good online conversation, are great ways of learning how to write with freedom and immediacy. You'll be surprised how much turns out to be useable material. But i got bored of these lengthy rants. I shifted gears... to haikus. For the last 5 friendster months, all i did was post haikus for testimonials. neat, eh? hehe. Kinda thought of posting them here. Yes... another boring hour for me. Notice that they got  name-titles,  in memory of my friendster friends. Nyahahahahaaa!!! Read on and see, feel and experience... my crap.   Jonald ONE declares a word, Then I declare his word – wit Is awe-inspiring  Anne Roofed with aptitude Docile, placid, immaculate  This gem.  Arose Right before me - a Wonder, and when did u get  Here, stunning lady?   Jing Hush, a beauty – fixed  Eyes have disobeyed to blink Before of you  Apple Is it you or I?  The apple’s eyes staring back  At me, so I smile  Abet Just numbered, faceless Short message, I’m waiting for A beep every day 	 Louis This world where ardor  Is colorless - yet greatly Yours dye my body.  Leo Somber afternoon Hay… must be you, dwelling in  My brainless cranium   Mikko Slow night, I hustle,  But an amiable guise, glues My eyes before his.  Louise Forlorn darkness hours. Her great wit and humbling charm Turn gloom to luster  Anna  There, across the room  With inconspicuous guise  She strums, chaste, pure heart.  Ann Mariel:  All day long you will, Behold, eyes smiling, you'll see, An afternoon breeze.  John Manuel: Jovial, I so beamed, Index finger, enter key, J.M. in my list.   *The following ones are the upshots of my relentless, eyebag-protracting 2am's.   Pee Crossed legged, stock-still Thirteen steps to rest room is A mile long for pee.  Cat I hit a cat by The broom on its head, I think  I heard the mouse laugh.    *And this one, was, believe it or not, rejected. gashed my heart. I chose not to post the recipient's name. (*WHINES*)    Radiance gleams, somewhere, I have seen magnificence. Amid the foliage.   MORE TO COME. IL KEEP YOU POSTED.

      Masarap pala ang chicken sandwich spread.   Mag aapat na araw na sa pridyider namin ang dalang pampalaman na ito ng kapatid ko. Di ako sigurado pero parang binigay sa kanya... tira noong nag birthday ang kasamahan nila sa trabaho sa clark ecozone. Sandamakmak ba namang manok ang binanlian, at siyempre kapares ang sandamakmak ding mayonnaise. Yun ang kwento ng kapatid ko. Pero minsan nag sisinungaling din iyan.   Di naman gawain ng kapatid ko, o sino man sa amin sa bahay ang mag uwi ng pagkain mula sa birthday, piyesta, o anumang okasyon na kelangan maghanda ng lomotyl, diatabs o anumang gamot panlaban sa diarrhea. Nasarapan siguro siya sa lasa.  Pagkatapos ng napakaiksing bakasyon, heto at namamalantsa na naman ako ng kulay luntian na uniporme, ang napagkasunduang kulay na isusuot sa trabaho tuwing lunes. ika-7 ng Hunyo bukas, aba at tingnan mo nga naman at kasabay pa ng pagbubukas namin ng klase ang pormal na pagtataas ng pamasahe. Limang piso na sa dyip ang dating apat at 72 na sa bus papuntang maynila, dati'y 60 lang. Kung ganito kabilis ang pagtaas ng mga bilihin at pamasahe sa pilipinas, katawa-tawa siguro ang sulatin kong ito kung babasahin ito sampung taon mula ngayon. Marahil ay singkwenta pesos na ang pamasahe sa dyip sa panahong yon, mula sa kanto namin hanggang sa palengke na dati'y nilalakad lang namin.  Gustuhin ko mang lakarin ang palengke ay di ko na magagawa. Maga ang aking mga paa dahil sa magkapares na sapatos na balat. Lagi kong sinasabi sa sarili, 'mabuti nang magain ang paa, 'wag lang magka alipunga.'  Dali dali kong huhubarin ang mga sapin ko sa paa pagdating ko ng bahay, at ay anong sarap! Anung presko ng pakiramdam na parang mga kaluluwang nahugasan ang kasalanan!  Gawi ko ang magbukas ng pridyider at sa pagkakataong ito, ang matabang bote na may  mala-pandikit na laman ang aking nasumpungan. Teka, naka on na ba ang telebisyon?   Masarap pala ang chicken sandwich spread.    chokang79 June 6, 2004

      COGITATION 060604  As the cold and darkness enfolds I sit with the piercing wind  With arms embracing my knees I feel the soft, white sand with my bare toes Unable to reach the light and Warmth waiting for me over the sea.  In my solitude, I mull over I know where I want and need to go I stumble; rummage around for the path ‘Just how to get there?’ Is all I ask. Bound by money Bound by time  Bound by distance But swathed in love. When will He let me be with my true love?

      POIGNANT PROMISES OF HEAVEN FOR THE SURVIVING  060604  From the heart comes the most dulcet air From two spirits meld together, the subtle harmonies But why do those, with all their senses, Speak that it is love that tears them distant?  When it’s with ardor  That one can subsist the stormiest weather.  Scent’s summer and the birds were nesting Our eyes met and saw his, gleaming Heaven sat by my side, and him on the other It’s the most sacred blessing I could not help but be blissful and cry, And utter Don’t wake me up if I am dreaming  But I am awake Where are the birds, the flowers and soft combing of the wind? The ripples have vanished and I am in despondent state My mind and heart had a covenant Of not to cry, but alas I feel the tears start to trickle Faced the sky to stop the flowing and attempt to question God But it’s his face; it is him that I saw My heart skipping a beat I tried to close my eyes Hoping that the darkness will pacify But once they had permitted to shut He is all I witness, And him alone, not with me, not.  Some people deem true in love at first sight,  Deceivingly right Drifting on love's endless blissful flight,  Love is a turncoat, a curse,  Turning my weak soul into a soldier of might A battle to call my own  Another endless, stabbing, Many a solitary nocturne,  Many a shadowy night.
