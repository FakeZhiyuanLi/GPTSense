      Wedneday evening: Got home, kissed wife, sent to get  urlLink dinner . Having a pregnant wife isn't so bad when you get a Butterbuger deluxe with cheese for dinner.  Running Tally:      Mark: +5 lbs   Jessica: -2 lbs.     Hmm, I'm betting those numbers should be going the other way...

      Wow!  One-fourth of the way done.  Amazing.  So just for the record, I haven't gained any weight, but Mark has gained 5 lbs.  Hee hee... But not to worry Mark, I am sure I will out gain you later.    The baby is two inches this week.  And is now reacting to the foods I eat.  I think it reacts to my sneezing too because my abdomen tenses and flutters.  It's cool.  I've never felt anything like it.

      I am having a lot of pressure in my abdomen today. I'm sure there's a lot of stretching going on. Last night we went to the Oliver Garden for dinner with my friend Pat and is finance' Leslie. It was fun. I could hardly eat a thing though. There seems to be no more room for my stomach. I eat like four bites and just don't want anymore. But then with out fail in a matter of an hour or so I am monsterously hungry again.  :)   It has been so hot here over the last few days. I was so happy to see it break last night. I thought I was going to just die. I was heat sensitive to being with before being pg, but it is so much hotter when you are. If there is one thing I have learned in the last few days, it is to not be really pg during the summer. I can't imagine how those ladies do it. They are stronger than me.

      Today was rough.  I had morning sickness the entire day.  It seems to come in waves.  I did manage to stay at work all day.  That is my goal each day.  Just make it through.    This weekend was good.  We became members at the Arboretum.  I hope to walk a lot there when our lil peanut is here.    My Grandma and Sue with the help of my aunt Pat got me a bunch of maternity clothes.  That was awesome.  I now have tons of outfits.  What an incredibly helpful thing for them to do.  It is so hard to find time and especially energy to go out and shop.

      I officially made the jump to maternity clothes. I couldn't breathe anymore. This is much more comfortable. It is strange because now I actually look pregnant and not like I just ate WAY too much. I weighed myself today. I am trying not to balloon too big. The doctor told me to gain between 25-30 pounds. So I am two days away from my third month and only gained 1 pound. I'm ok with that.

       Tonight I had an information session for work which means I worked 13 hours today.  Well, at the information night (entitled shake it up) I had a chocolate shake.  BOY, WAS I WIRED!  I cannot believe how much this baby has taken over my body.  I have never been wired off of sugar.  It made for an interesting presentation to the 50 people I spoke to.  I don't think I will participate in the shakes next week though.  ;-)

      No longer an embryo, we now have a little fetus. Our baby is now 3/4 inches long. From what I have read, this is where we are so far.   The embryonic tail is disappearing, and the eyelids cover its eyes. The fingers and toes are growing longer but they are still slightly webbed. The arms have lengthened and the hands are now flexed at the wrist and meet over its heart. The knee joints have formed, and the feet may be long enough to meet in front of its body. The trunk is straightening out, and so the head is more erect. Breathing tubes extend from the throat to the branches of developing lungs. The nerve cells in the brain are also branching out to connect with one another, forming neural pathways.   Truly amazing, there is no doubt this is God's creation.

      When I told Sally at work she literally squealed with excitement. Loud enough to pull Barry from three rows over to see what the excitement was. So I got to tell him also. No squeal though.

      On Saturday we went to  urlLink Litchfield  to watch  urlLink Brittany  perform in the color guard. They are a really good marching band and have the awards to show it.  So, when we brought Brit back home they gave us a gift bag with a baby hand and foot imprint kit and a set of baby booties. It's kind of surreal, but we're really going to have a baby! I guess it's really starting to sink in now.

      Well, I officially feel huge.  Nothing fits anymore and bizarre enough, I haven't gained an oz.  Last night we decided that Arby's would be a good idea for dinner.  It wasn't.  I think I am done with fast food for at least awhile.  I seem to be having an easier time with fatigue but a tougher time with food now.  It is true what they tell you about needing to go the bathroom a lot too.  I get up in the night at least a couple of times.    Today, It is supposed to be 86 degrees here and we are going to Litchfield to watch Brittany's high school band march.  It will be very warm.  I have noticed that the heat feels warmer than it used to.  I plan to just bring a case of water and an umbrella to hopefully shade out the sun.   Mark has been wonderful about things.  I can't make dinner anymore because the smells nauseate me.  I am also not allowed to do much of the cleaning because of the product fumes. So he has been doing a lot of the things I used to do.  I can hear him right now trying to give Colin a bath. There is a lot of shuffling going on upstairs. LOL.     We went to the doctor this week for our first visit.  We met with the supervising RN Pam.  She was pretty nice.  They took my blood for tests and figured out the due date (turns out we had it off by a bit).  They had us watch a video on premature labor (ya know just in case I go into labor or something at eight weeks....) and it was very educational.  They told us we would be having the baby at St. John's hospital in Maplewood.  It seems like a nice hospital.  We will have a private room and the baby can stay with us.  There will be a second bed in the room so Mark can stay too.  The whole thing is a bit surreal at the moment.  Who knew that something the size of a grape could have such an impact on my body?    We'll post again soon.  Later.

      Jessica and I just got back from our first visit to North Suburban Family Physicians. We thought there was going to be an exam etc, but it was mostly paper work and educational. Jessica did have to give blood and she was very brave. I don't know if all of the stuff has sunk it yet, but we go a lot of papers to read through later. We also took care of most of the insurance paper work and filled out our admissions form for  urlLink the hospital . So now, when It's Timeâ„¢, we just call ahead and go right to  urlLink delivery .  Our RN Pam was really nice and I'm glad to know that she also works the phone line so we can call if we need something.  Lastly, we got a free diaper bag from Similac with a free can of formula mix, an insulated bottle pack, a coupon book, a booklet on breast feeding (interesting from a formula company) and a teeny little amount of diaper rash ointment. Let the free stuff begin!

      Jessica cut a full foot of hair to donate for  urlLink Locks of Love , so I'm posting a photo of her new hair style (and her donation).     And here's another pic I took, just for fun

      Saw the doc on Tuesday for the first monthly checkup. Everything went swimmingly. We had the chance to listen to the baby's heart beat as provided by a doppler. I must admit it was pretty cool to know that a tiny little heart's already beating. Jessica was so excited she teared up!  And, of course, we had a way of recording the moment. So you can  urlLink listen to the heart beat  yourself.

      I seem to remember hearing that it will get better when you are done with the first trimester.  Well, I have always thought my due date was a little off.  I think I am really due on the 26th of Feburary.  The fact that I threw up four times already today seems to lead me to believe I am right.  We shall see.....  We haven't done much this weekend.  We went walking twice. And we just got done watching "Cheaper By The Dozen".  Yeah, we won't be having 12 kids.  That was out of control.    I am really looking forward to next weekend when pre-season football games are on.  GO VIKINGS!!!

      So I am getting really excited for this first trimester to be over. For some reason the nausea has seem to come back full force. I have decided that TUMS are evil. They only make the situation worse. But enough of the complaining.  Mark brought home another freebie baby bag the other day. It was from Medtronic. It had all kinds of samples and things in it. But the best thing of all was a baby shirt that says "Future CEO" Medtronic. It is stinkin cute!!! I heard they also make baby scrubs and so we'll have to look into getting some of those for the hospital.  We go to the doctor again on Monday.  Can't wait to hear the heart beat.
