      Sometimes life just gets so fast paced, that there's nothing else for it to do....it has to slow down.  I just realized, that's not always a bad thing.  It's going to happen....maybe se we can be even happier when something good comes up.  Instead of complaining, I should use this as an opportunity to do something nice, be a better person, a better friend, a better girlfriend.  So, this is my new... and more postitive outlook.  Hope you like.           ~KelC

      I wish people could just mind their own business.Stop judging people on the crap you hear about them.   1. It may not be true 2. If it is, you dont' know the situation.   I've heard a lot of rumors lately about girls I consider pretty decent friends.  Then, you all look down on them, because you want to think you're better than that.  Well, get over it.  I'm sick of being asked "what I've done" with guys, I'm sick of hearing other girls get asked the same question.  I'm asking  you  a question : Why do you care?  Seriously, does it give you some kind of power to know?  Then, when we won't tell you, you say, ohhh, I won't tell. So, why the hell do you want to know?  The only reason is so that you can tell other people about it....sound like you've got all the info.  Why should I expect you to keep it to yourself if I can't?  It's just getting to the point where it's ridiculous... Leave me alone if you have nothing better to talk about

      Yesterday. Auditions for the musical...went fairly well I think, I only got to read one line (bummer) but the song turned out fairly well.  Wasn't as good as when I practiced it, but then again, nothing ever is, so I was pleased with it.  I can't wait to see who got what tomorrow ! If nothing else, this was a good experience. I tried out with Joann Durbin, Brian Conrad, Matt Carlen, China Davis , Brent Cope, and another girl I don't know from anywhere else.  Everyone was great....heh, made me look bad.  Well, I'll let you know how it all turns out, tomorrow.    Strangers will become Acquaintances  Acquaintances will become Friends Friends will become the People you Love I'm looking forward to every new Stranger

      Went home sick from school today.  I feel horrible....my throat is all scratchy and sore, figures since it's the day before auditions...  I'm under the strict orders to speak as little as possible until tomorrow, after I sing.  I'm not seeing that actually happening, because I can't stand not being able to communicate.  So, I'm asking you all to learn sign language by tomorrow so you can talk with me and not screw up my voice. (ha....if only it were that simple)  I got a cheerleader comment today.  Stereotypes, people....stop it.  The funny thing is it was from a football player (hahaha) who is undoubtedly(let's try to say this nicely...) less mentally endowed than me.  Also, it was after I had figured out something for a teacher, I'd think that would make me look smart.  When will the irony stop?  I have the sudden desire to let everyone know that I appreciate them.  I just realized that someone I didn't think cared about me that much does.  I appreciate the fact that you thought about me, for some reason it made my day a lot better.  All for now.  If I don't get some comments (press the shout out button), I might go crazy! lol ~KelC

      I'm getting kind of discouraged about my blogging.  Since I havent' figured out   how   to add a comment button to my blog, I feel as if no one's even reading.....as if no one cares.  I love to read blogs, and I love to blog, but half of it is hearing your responses.If you like something I write....or dont' like something I write....tell me about it.  Yea, I know it takes a little extra effort to e-mail me and everything, but I'd really appreciate it.  Especially with my   urlLink deep thoughts page  . I love it when you guys IM me and tell me what you think about it.  ~KelC  dramagurl87@aol.com

      Tonight was awesome. I was with Justin....and just being with him is so wonderful.  I can't even describe it.   So why am I blogging about it?   It's too great not to include in my blog.  I need to sleep, but I just can't.  Damn you, Justin, turning me into an insomniac! lol...    Tommorow, I'm most likely going to see Two Weeks Notice with Jacqueline/Brett (whatever she goes by these days ; P)  So....that should be tons of  fun.  I hear it's good, but you never know until you see it yourself.  I'm sure Jacque and I will have a blast either way!  Well, I havent' got much more to say.....e-mail me   dramagurl87@aol.com  ~KelC

      I need to get my butt in gear if I'm going to get my part in the play.  My social life is taking over ...lol, but I'm not complaining.  I was out with Justin last night, and I'm doing the same later today....What can I say? I'm addicted.  I did, however, go to the freshman basketball game this morning....which we WON! Kick-ass job, guys. Especailly to Clark, you ARE awesome, just treat my best freind like the princess she is, and you'll be on my good side ; )    I just realized it's 3:00, and I'm still in morning mode.  So, even though I rarely drink coffee, I need some...badly.  I had a conversation with Justin the other day that made me pay attention to the importance people place on appearance.  I guess it was just on my mind, but this morning at the game, we were looking at a magazine and someone said "Oh my god! I can't believe she's wearing those shoes with that shirt! Hello? That's just ridiculous, really."  Sounds exactly like what Justin talked about.  Honestly, who cares? I went to the game this morning in a big sweatshirt with no make-up on and my hair thrown up in a ponytail.  It's not like anyone said anything.  A couple of guys told me that they appreciated the fact that we were there. So stop worrying! ( By the way, I am somewhat of a hypocrite , because  I spend almost an hour getting ready in the morning, but you'll have that.)  Sick of complaining  Sometimes people need roses.... they need to be wined and dined Right now, I want daises and McDonalds Maybe it sounds silly, but I prefer the little things   dramagurl87@aol.com http://kelcsdeepthoughts.blogspot.com

      Fight Club. Wow.  I jsut sat at Megan's house for two and a half hours staring at the tv screen. Wierdest movie I've ever seen, but that's not a bad thing.  The ironic thing about it is I didn't' actually enjoy watching the movie, as awesome as it was, because  I didnt' know it was good until the end.   Yea, I know, reading that, it doesnt' make much sense to me either...    I realized last ngiht, talking to Justin,that some people dont' realize how awesome Incubus is.   Seriously, everyone needs to listen to a song by them that isnt' on the radio (or even one that is), listen to the lyrics and the music and you have to realize that they are great.  A good song by them.... Aqeuous Transmission   I'm floating down a river Oars freed from their holes long ago Lying face up on the floor of my vessel I marvel at the stars And feel my heart overflow  Further down the river  Two weeks without my lover I'm in this boat alone Floating down a river named emotion Will I make it back to shore Or drift into the unknown  Further down the river  I'm building an antenna Transmissions will be sent when I am through Maybe we'll meet again further down the river And share what we both discovered... Then revel in the view  All for now~KelC

      It's scary how alone you can feel sitting in a room full of people....That's how I've felt all day.  Lonely, for some reason.  Searching for companionship.  The day was so long.  All I've wanted to do was get some alone time with Megan or Justin, someone who understands me. I got to be with Megan for a while at practice. Funny, that's the only time you'll ever hear me say that cheerleading is the highlight of my day.  All Meg and I were doign was goofing off, not hurtin anyone, but we still got "shut ups" and dirty looks form some of the girls.  I'm sorry you're jealous that we have an awesome friendship.     As you might know my neice and nephew are staying with us for a while.  Just tonight my mom's best friend came by and she's staying here too... we have no room,  I dont' know why everyone decided to come here, I guess this must be the place to go.  We might as well start a bed and breakfast so we can make a little money off of it...lol.  I guess I should be happy to share my home with people that love me. It just gets a little frustrating with 6 peopel in a three bedroom, one bathroom house.  Life is full of ups and downs You're a high altitude kinda guy    ~KelC  want to comment?   dramagurl87@aol.com  http://kelcsdeepthoughts.blogspot.com

      My mind is filled with thoughts of Conrad Birdie.... pretty much all I've been thinking about for the last two days is the musical.  I have my heart set on a certain part, that I probably won't get, not that it's such a big part, but because there are lots of other girls wanting to be in this musical, and I am but a lowly freshman. I'm still going to give it my all though, and see what happens. Worst comes to worst, I will just know better for next year.....So, Justin and I have been going out for a month today.  It's great, but it doesn't feel like anything big....which is a good thing, because I'm not worried about time , just happy to be with him.  Cheerleading was hard work, today....but we learned an awesome dance, I got so into it...it was crazy.  I guess that partailly comes from not going to dance for about a month....withdrawal.  I really feel the need to do stuff like that lately.... blogging's got me writing again, and the musical's got me singing, who knows, I might even start drawing all the time, like I used to. I doubt it though, because there's not enough time in the day to do everything I love.....(besides Justin.....lol, that was a JOKE....you sick minded people) anyway, that's about all I have to say for right now. Love you guys - KelC

      Fromm watching the first Joe Millionaire, I've established that it's not worth my time, seriously, it's not very good.  But....that doesn't mean I won't watch it next week...lol.  So all my time I've spent after practice has been singing (besides watching Joe and blogging....oh and of course talking to my Justin).  Why is KelC singing you might ask....I'm trying desperately to prepare for tryouts for Bye Bye Birdie.  K, now you're probably thinking I'm crazier than you thought...but I guess it's my thing. Singing, dancing, acting, I love it.  I can't explain what it is, soem kind of high that leaves me wanting more. Maybe it's the challenge of it, the fact that you get to become another person, it's great. It makes you see things so differently. My passion I guess....don't want to bore you to death with it though, so I'm out.   *Wish me luck!*- KelC

      I'm proud to say that I just read Abe's blog site and it is worth any amount of time you put into reading it...I advise you to do so. He's a poetic genius in my mind.  I'm sure all of my blogs are meaningless when compared with abe's.   The site is http://oh_no_not_abe.blogspot.com. Seriously, its' worth the effort...inspiring, as I see it.  His whole site is my deep thoughts page ( http://kelcsdeeptoughts.blogspot.com ) times 10, times 100.  So anyway, now that I'm done telling you about what a god Abe is...  I've realized just recently how shallow and ignorant I've been in the past.... I'd like to apologize to anyone I've hurt because of it. I know there are some of you out there.  If I haven't hurt you with it, then chances are being around me in the past has made you act more retarded than you would have. New year, new Kelsey. Hold me to it, don't let me slack off.  (k...let me be the dork that I am...but nothing past that)  love you all- KelC

My brother left a few days ago to go back to the army....He lives in Texas, so I only get to see him once a year, so sad : (    I miss him already....I guess you realize how much you love soemone when they're gone. Oh! That reminds me! Meg and I are goign to New Mexico! by ourselves...to visit her brother , it  is going to be SO awesome! ahh! I'm really excited about it!

      Hey everyone! This is my first blog....ahh, I know you're all so proud! I have been having so much fun over winter break....it's been awesome.  Most of my time I've spent with Megan and Justin...the best friend, the boyfriend, you know how it goes. Last Night I saw Lord of the Rings 2 with Meg ...and Kayla, Kyle, Clark, and Chase.  Then Meg and I went back to her house, watched some tv, chatted it up and hit the sack. Tonight I went to Justins...we watched The Green Mile (tears... Mr. Jingles is SO cute!) So that was bunches of fun, just hanging out with my man and all. I learned 2 chords on my guitar today....without the help of Heath, who is SUPPOSED to be giving me lessons...lol, just messin with ya, Heath.  That's about it for now....congrats to Megan and Jacquelline for landing your men ( Scott and Clark) love everyone lots- KelC   urlLink

      Wow, it's been forever since I've blogged.  News: I can now play the guitar, my hair is  brown, and I've decided NOT to try out for cheerleading next year.  Right now, I'm really confused.  Things are kind of icky between me and Justin.  He's leaning towards ending the relationship...and that scares me.  I really want to try and make this work out, but the people I trust most, the people whos opinions I value are saying that I should end it myself, before I get hurt worse...CoNfUsIoN!  It's just so frustrating....I just want to be happy, and I want him to be happy too.  I'm just not sure both of those things are possible at the same time, anymore.  It's probably my fault.  I've changed so much since I've been with him. In my opinion, in good ways, but we're both different people than we were 3 months ago.  I just don't know how he really feels. Bleck. That's all I have to say for now, bleck.

      As of now, I'm working on a way to consolidate my two blogs.  I realized that people don't go to my  urlLink other blog  , and it's by far better.  I don't want to lose my links, though, which are on this blog, and I don't want to lose the archives from either one, especially not my deep thoughts page.  Suggestions? I need them.

      Choral Festival Thursday was awesome.  I loved singing with all these people who know what they're doing, and not to brag, but we sounded great.  I really want to thank Katie Wolfe, you helped me out a lot with our part .By the way, your solo...awesome.   Festival really made me appreciate choir, and renewed my love for singing.  Heh, singing wasn't all that went down, though.  Laura, Wendy, and I spent our dinner time freaking out this guy, we now know as Aaron.  We sat there and yelled out random guys names until he looked.  We thought it was Eric, then Laura started loudly rambling about this imaginary fling she and "Eric" had last summer. (we found out his name, later)  Yea, all the kids from otu of town were just staring. It's fun to freak out people you don't know.  It could've been the air fresheners Laura and I had on our wrists, too (haha, leaf power). The point of that was, it was great, maybe almost worth missing the Something Corporate concert for, MaYbE.  Everyone who went said it was awesome, and I'm sorry I missed out. That's about all for now.  Wrote a new song, it's on my deep thoughts page. Check it out.  Later

      Some people tick me off.  Today, one of the girls I sit with at lunch did soemthing really mean. No... really mean doesnt' cut it. I'm leaning towards heartless and vicious, just to have a laugh. It was retarded.  She walked over to these two girls in my lunch hour that are best friends, and asked them if they were lesbians.  That was so rude....uncalled for.  One of those girls is a friend of mine, and the other is a friend's gf.... So, I know these are really great people....and this girl was just being completely ignorant.  She told us all that she was going to ask,and I said something like "hey, first of all, that's really mean. Second, I know they aren't, because one of them has a boyfriend.  She just gave me a look like, "Oh, isn't that cute that you care so much"  I couldn't watch when she did it.  I felt so horrible that I even associate with those kind of people.  Then, to make it worse, everyone laughed when she came back and told us about it.  I made sure they knew it upset me and people backed off.     Just when you think you can expect a certain amount of decency from people, the prove you wrong.

      I feel awful. Katie P. invited me to go to church with her this morning...and I was going to go but I left my purse(along with my keys) in Shannon's car...so I couldn't get into my mom's house to get clothes.  So, I just didnt' go to church.  I feel really bad about it, and I'm going to get her number and call and apologize...I just hope she's not mad.    The cast party last night was pretty uneventful.  Everyone pretty much just stood around watching the majority of the freshmen girls dance around looking like idiots.  I mean...soemtimes we dance around and act dorky just for fun...but these girls were getting down to some backstreet boys. heh. So, Katie W., Jordan and I went to taco bell and shared a chicken quesidilla....it was very good.  The gravity in the car kept making Jordan and I fall on each other...geeze that was annoying! lol.  It was kind of wierd thinking next year I won't have a Shan to hang out with at the play....everything will be so different.  Some people got all teary, but I wasn't  that  emotional.    Laura, Jacquelline, and I were supposed to go shopping this afternoon. I dont' think it's happening (since we havent' found a ride, yet...) But, oh well...I still have insight to look forward to. Wonder if Matt will be there....pray for him if you get a chance.

      The play was awesome!  I think it went very well, and everyone did wonderfully.  There was a small goof in the second scene, but other than that it was about perfect.  It's kind of sad, because we had so much fun putting it together, and after tonight it will be over.  Ah, oh well....I'd like to say "there's always next year", but it won't be the same. Shan, Anne, and Brian will be gone.  I'll still have Wendy and Katie W. (hopefully LAURA, too), and Matt to entertain me.  So, it'll be alright, lol.  I'm really excited about tonight, and the cast party...yay! Apparently, I get to bring a guest...can anyone guess who I'm taking? hehe. Mr. DeWilde will certainly liven up the party. I just figured out that the party's going to be about 50 feet away from my dad's house...so I wont' have a problem getting home, anymore.  I think sunday I'm going to Katie P's church, then shopping with Laura and Jaq, then to insight. It should be fun.....

      I feel like throwing up, or crying, or both, or  something . I hate this. Just when I'm happy, completely content....certain people have to decide to enter back in to my life and confuse me.  Go to hell, Justin Litz. I'm sorry, but I'm angry.  He starts sayign stuff, like "he thinks about me all the time"...and crap like that. I let him know I'm taken and that's not gonna change.  I actually bought it for a minute that he sincerely missed me.  But, after he  knows   I don't want him back, he's hitting on girls the same night.  And he's incapable of having a friendship with me.  I'm so sick of this bs. I never once considered going back with him, or anything like that....dont' get me wrong, but its' really hard when soemone you were with for 3 months starts saying that kind of stuff, and you're in a relationship with an awesome guy.  It's just all so complicated.  And, I'm sorry if you're reading, Justin, but that's the way it is, and I've given up on being friends with you.  I just have to not let this effect me, because I'm so lucky, I have something..someone great.  I hope I never lose you. Most of all,I hope the drama stops.

      Went to the Common Ground last night with Abe. That was a lot of fun....except LAURA wasnt' there. Abe had an ear infection...so we sat in the back for the first band.  Then, Object Permanance (sp?) played, and they were awesome.(awesome enough for abe to put up with his headache and stand up front) Shannon compared the lead singer, Micah, to John Mayer. Well...he's not  that good, but that's not to say he wasnt' great, because it's a difficult task to come anywhere near JM.  It inspired me to start practicing my guitar harder.  I also found out that Abe and I have a lot more in common than I thought.  So, it was a good expierience no matter how you look at it.  Rock on!

      I feel like a giggling school girl! (Oh wait, I am)  Last night Jordan and I met at the China Pavillion, mainly because I wanted to see him, partially because I was craving Chinese.  Wonderful, as usual....we had some interesting fortune cookies, too. Mine said "Excitement and intrigue follow you closely wherever you go!"....and Jordan's said "Give the person sitting next to you a kiss". lol, we didn't even know they had fortunes like that....but hey, the cookie people wanted us to kiss, what can I say? So, after dinner we walked over to North Lanes and as soon as we walked in a bunch of drunk guys said "Hey.... bowlers , now we have someone to make fun of."  Luckily, they didn't, or at least not loudly.  We did pretty well, I'd say. Jordan got a 264, I got a 241(never mind that that's three scores added together....) After that we just walked around...jumped rope(vacuum cleaner hose) at the car wash, walked through Long John Silver's and rang the bell, pushed each other in shopping carts and danced to grocery store music.  I had so much fun. No doubt, that was the most creative date I've ever been on.  I'm glad I finally found someone I can really have fun with.*smiles*

      I had  such  an awesome time, tonight.  I went to Andrea's party, and we had so much fun.  Dance contest-Matt, Brian, and Brent took us out, but Jordan and I were clearly the people's favorites....heh, the crowd pleasers that we are.  I even dipped him, yea it was awesome.   We played twister, too. People kept falling on me, so I never won. (tears) Abe slicked back his hair...looked just like Fonze (and of course, he gets the girls, too) And how could I forget? The Reber girls dressed up as 50's hookers....I even have on of Jenny's feathers!(lucky me)

      Last night was great.  I went to the Memorial School carnival for a while and helped Jordan with the fish game.  I had a 9 year old hit on me, and one little girl there thought Jordan was just "it."  She wouldn't stop staring at him. As Anne said, I have some competition, now...heh.  Then we went and got Happy Gilmore from the video store...but that tape is screwed up, so we had to go back and we got Road to Perdition.  Bad choice on my part.  Jordan and I were lost the whole way through....but hey, they killed a lot of people, and we talked about other tings half the time, anyway. Then we made milk shakes (which were awesome, Jordan) .  Well, actually we (meaning I) spilt the first one all over the counter, but you'll have that.  Anyway, the night turned out to be really good, goodnight hugs and all ;) And, btw....my heart is now offically spoken for.

      As of yesterday I am officially "part of the group". Shannon gave me one of the plastic star bracelets a few of my friends have been sporting, lately.  I feel special! Today made me think about how lucky I am.  Thad Ryan talked to us about "the crash" today in Driver's Ed.  There's a lot of things I didnt' realize about it. For example....he was close to having to go to jail.  That seems so harsh. I mean, you'd have to realize the pain he went through. How could anyone send him to jail after all that?  It's really scary to think that someone our age could just be gone in a matter of minutes.  It makes you appreciate the friends you have.  So, even though our friendships may be signified by plastic stars and paper clip bracelets, they arent' as easily broken. I love you all.

      Heh, last night. What can I say about last night? Went to see Bringing Down The House with a certain someone... that was a really cute movie, although we spent most of the time making fun of it and the people around us.  Then, we headed off to Florinda's.  In the time it took us to get from the show to the pizza 3 peopel on the square screamed out "Hey, Jordan!" from their cars. I felt un-hey!ed.  lol. But, Jennifer and Coleen said hi to me at Florinda's, so the self esteem went up a notch.  We had great conversation, for the hour and a half we were at Florinda's....minus the few moments of akward silence. After that I went home, jumped in the shower and threw on some John Mayer.    Had to wake up at 6 this morning, though.  The cheerleaders + FCA people  served a pancake/sausage breakfast. We had as much fun as you can at 7 in the morning.... I think tonight i'm going to the common ground, hang out with abe and some other people.  I'm SO glad it's the weekend, again.

      Play practice last night was pretty decent.  Everyone was in a good mood.  There are a couple of guys, I guess, that like me. Heard this through the grapevine...well one of them told me, but hey.  That's so crazy. I can't be in a relationship at this moment.  My heart wouldn't be in it.  You know where my heart would be.  I have had  thoughts about one guy....I guess you're always gonna have those thoughts, no matter what.  Strangely enough, he isn't one who likes me. heh, so ironic.  Sorry, I complain about the most retarded things.  I've been practicing my guitar so much lately. Sorry to say, it hasn't been the song Heath told me to practice....oh well. Matt Benton gave me the chords to some of the songs from insight....so, that's pretty much all I've been playing.  I love it, though....I'll just sit there for hours (if I have the time) and get lost playing.  Craziness.  Until later...

      Well....it's over now, for sure. I was really upset...but now I feel better just to know for sure, instead of wondering where this is going.  It might take a while....but I'll be back to normal. Thanks to everyone who has helped me through this.  I appreciate it.  Until later, heartbroken....

      I'm beginning to think that this blog is useless.  No one really reads...or comments or anything. It's purposeless...just to update you on my life...which you most likely already know about. And, most of all, it doesnt' seem like me...it's the me you see every day. You can talk to me in the hall.....and have some kind of meaningless conversation such as what goes on in this blog. But...that's not what blogs are for..they'r for feelings and emotions and poetry and thinking...so I'll most likely be ending this one some tiem soon, and I'll probably post more frequently in the other. http://kelcsdeepthoughts.blogspot.com

So after that we jsut went rdign aroudn for a little bit. Then we went by Amanda's and picked up Chad and Dylan.  We made prank calls...heh( I mad prank calls and they laughed). Well, Dylan did make a few  with his "joy ride" voice. ahh...that was fun. I have no idea what I'm doign tonight...well with half the town gone at a band concert or soemthing. blah, who knows.

      Spring Break. The much anticipated time when you don't have to deal with school.   Overrated? Possibly.   I spent the first night of spring break braiding hair at Laura's house.  We had some laughs, talked a lot, but the braiding....yea, didnt' get finished. Abe called us, which was nice.  There's never a lack of conversation with Abe in the midst, that's for sure.  By the end of the night I think I was more exhausted than anything.  Just because your mind knows you dont' have to get up at 6 the next day, doesn't mean your body's clued in.    Friday night Megan, Clark and I went to the movies in Decatur...saw Bringing Down The House for the second time....although I wanted to see Phone Booth, you don't always get your way.  After that we went swimming at Coach Hansen's. Megan and Clark decided they'd lay the smack down on me in volleyball. I have no shame. Why do you think I did cheerleading?  Well, I went to bed with a wet head which ended up ruining my awesome braids. Oh well, I'll redo it sometime for those of you who missed out.   Saturday I went to Shannon's birthday party, which was awesome.  We all met at the park and played some rather messy games....like egg toss and chubby pickle and bobbing for sardines in chocolate pudding(ask me about that one).  Then, we cleaned up and headed out to the Texas Road House.  That was awesome.  We watched a rousing game of soccer in the waiting room for about 45 minutes. I was sure we were going to get kicked out. We were SO LOUD! ahh.  Shan got to ride one the birthday saddle while the waiters (and the 20 birthday guests) sang to her.  Then, Jeremy decided to sit on my lap and feed me cake, in the process getting it all over my face.  Heath was laughing, not funny. (ha, well actually it kind of was, but oh well)  Sunday went to efree for church, had a 2 and a half hour phone conversation with Abe, then had dinner at my grandma's later on. Today, I'm still deciding on what to do, if anything.  Might just further my title of "internet junkie" Whatever, it doesn't matter. It's Spring Break.

      Went to see Chicago, tonight with Abe. It was an awesome movie! Worth the $3.50 that the movie theater now makes you pay. It was so jazzy, and so much singing and dancing, all the stuff I like.  Plus, it had some humor and drama. Abe was good company, too.  I think I have some sort of disorder, though.  I get easily jealous of friends. I mean, I don't even have any reason to be, but it's like I want to be  everyone's  best friend.  AGH! I have so many stupid little things I need to fix.  But, oh well...at least you know yo're not going to lose me as a friend, I WILL pursue you. heh.  I actually think I'm losing a friend. She and I have been friends for a long time, and it seems like we're drifting apart. We never talk anymore or do anything... it's really sad, because I used to consider her my best friend...and I dunno, I guess we're just going in different directions.  Maybe it's for the best...I mean, I guess we don't have that much in common anymore, as much as  hate to say it, if we didnt' know each other and met now, we wouldn't be friends.  Loosing people sucks.  But, then again, I think of all of the new friends I've made...and it's so awesome.  I mean, my best friends are the ones I've made really recently.  I can't wait for summer! It means independence in so many ways...I'll spare you and not list them, because I g2g. Love you all!

      The revival was wonderful! It helped me grow a lot. I think the speaker, though I didnt' expect him to be, was awesome....it took him a while to get to the point, but....when he finally did it was well worth the wait (heh..which is also the name of an awesome band I know...).  He talked about almost everything that's been on my mind (having to do with Christ). It's all about living your life with passion....and who doesn't want that? Christian or non-christian, aren't we all lookign for a cause, for something to live for?  For whoever reads this before 7 Tuesday night, I really encourage you to come. No matter who you are. It's at the Taylorville Christian Church  from 7- 8:30/8:45. Just go in the main entrance and they'll tell you where to go.  It's worth the time. Right, Kay?  Well, I hope to see everyone there. Love you!

      Wow, last night was so awesome.  It was like....jumping up and down, surrounded by a combination of my best friends and strangers, sweating profusely, with no room between you and the person beside you, in what felt like 100 degree temperature. Slingshot and Worth The Wait were both awesome. Kudos to Jeremy and Matt. You impressed me.  Not only was the music great, but so was the message...what Matt(wtw) and Ben (slingshot) said really touched me...and I hope it had the same effect on other people, because that's what the purpose of the concert was, to bring Jesus to people. I think it was at least somewhat effective. It gives you that motivation to really seek Jesus out, even if you're already a Christian. The work out wasn't bad either...heh, and i do mean workout, I had to stop and catch my breath at times.  The point is...Jesus is everywhere we can't escape him.  That's the way I like it.

      Dyed my hair DARK last night, or rather, Shannon did. A lot of people said it was cute and some others, I could tell (including my mother) didnt' have such a high opinion of it. I personally do not care, I love it. It feels like me.  I've been wanting for so long for people to see me as smart, and maybe it sounds stupid, but I think that people honestly look at you differently based on appearance.  I wish it weren't so...but it is. That's that. Besides  that I had an awesome worship session tonight. (doesn't that somehow sound dirty, like a make out session or something?...maybe it's just me and i need to get my mind out of the gutter) I felt really close to God. It was amazing.   Ha...so do you ever wonder if you're wierd? I mean, really wierd, like if your'e the only person who feels the feelings you feel? Like you're the only person in this circumstance. When I tell people things, that I think are perfectly acceptable, I think I scare them away, sometimes. Like, me telling you about my religion, about my closeness to God. Does that scare you? Does that make you want to draw away from me...put some sort of barrior up, because maybe you dont' agree? Just wondering, because that's how it feels sometimes...with everyone.  I dont' think there's anyone I feel comfortable sharing  everything  with. Because, if I do, I feel like they dont' understand, or it makes them look down on me.  I wish I could just talk out something (soem specific something) with someone (no specific anyone). It'd really make me feel better, but it's a touchy subject and everyone I've brought it up with backs away from it. AGGHH! Enough of this chattering, I need to clear my mind. I need to stop blogging. Okay...I've stopped.

      Girls' Night Out...  Long John Silver's, bowling, and girl talk.  Reminds me quickly that we live in Taylorville. It was still fun.... come to think of it, it was  so  much fun. I can't remember the last time it was just us three together. Wait a minute....actually, I can.  It was Jacqueline's birthday. We had so much fun.  Committed a crime...I won't say what that was in the event that the wrong eyes see this....which is very possible. We're insane....but you could never know just  how  crazy we are.     Common Ground...  Solifide was awesome. Great entertainers. Especially that crazy lead singer who nearly fell on us 3 times.  I saw his spit fly half-way across the room more times that I can say. The drummer was smiling the whole time. Geeky-cute, that's what I'd call him. ( I can just hear Abe saying "cute, Kelsey, cute? Is that all you're judging him on?") Yea, it is. He was geeky-cute. Sanctus Real was good, as well. A little more mellow. :/  I was in the mood for crazy.  Some guy hit on me...from Nashville. I'm just thinking...what's the point, I'm never going to see you again.  Oh well...it must have been my magnetic personality...oh wait, I was acting like a crazy wierdo last night....I dunno what it was, then.  Then we went outside and sang praise songs while Shannon played. Too bad I had to leave after the first song. Nevertheless...it was a night for memories.

      I've missed this blog....not sure if you have or not, but I've missed it.  I miss writing about what's going on in my life....I think it makes me look at it. Makes me see how I've been living...what I've been living for.  So, what have I been living for?  Lately, I've been living for the weekends...living for summer. Now that it's here, I'm not so sure this is as great as I thought. Half of the people I care about are leaving. This is for real. This is forever.  I'm sure I'll keep in touch with some of them. And others, I'll never see again.  What about the ones I never got to talk to? The seniors I saw every day, but never made any effort to connect with? They could've been awesome friends, but I'll never know.  Scares me a little. Oh well, I still have my younger friends, right? Maybe...   I never realized how easily people will give up on you, if you don't please them.  A friend of mine and I have been a little on edge with each other lately...why? Because I'm doing something he doesn't approve of.  So now he's mad.  I don't know what to do. I can't just conform to his thinking all the time so that he'll like me...but I don't want to lose such a good friend.  Maybe my point of view has changed...you dont' know, because everytime I try to talk to you all I hear is "yea...uh huh"  Then, you try to spark jealousy. I'm sure of it.  You know that's one of my weaknesses...because I told you about it. Because I was open with you, and you use that against me.  You don't know how much you mean to me...and how hard it is to stand up to you....and how much harder it is to face the consiquences when I do.  So...we've established so far from this that I live for people, for my friends, for my more-than-friends, for my not-quite-friends.  What happens if all the people go away? What happens if no one loves me? I'm not sure I'd have enough substance to take that... After all, they are what I'm living for. Sometimes I wonder how people could ever consider suicide.  Now I realize that I might not think they were so crazy if everything I love was taken away from me....and the scary thing is : IT COULD ALL, SO EASILY, BE TAKEN AWAY. I hate to be so negative....but, I really need to find something better to live for. Something better than other people. I think in my heart I know what that something is....  GOD...that's what it is and I KNOW it. Why do I keep denying what I know is right? I can think it over as much as I want....but I know the answer from the beginning.   Ah....so now I'm just rambling. Is anybody out there?

      Where have you gone?   *We used to talk every day *We used to have meaningful conversations about religion, and love, and just life in general *I used to consider you one of my best friends, if not  the   best friend *I used to give you rides home from school and smile as we waved goodbye *I used to enjoy your company *You used to make me laugh *You used to correct me, and I liked it *You used to comfort me when I felt lik crying *You used to be there  But now you aren't. And when we do talk it's just constant fighting.  I'm getting sick of this. And what's worse is that I have no idea what happened. I have no idea what's changed. I have a feeling it's me, though. It's always me. Always the one to blame becaues each day I'm not the Kelsey I was yesterday. I grow and change. Maybe I've changed too much.  Maybe I'll always change too much. Maybe it' pointless making friends, or having boyfriends, because I'll just keep changing. I'll never be the person I was when you met me.  I can't be.   So what's a girl to do?  I thought change was supposed to be a  good  thing.

      "I have nice hips?"  This seems quite odd to me. That anyone would notice them. Although they are my favorite part of my body, no one has ever complimented my hips, much less a guy. I just pull out the nervous smile.  If he's looking at my hips, what else is he looking at?    Now, maybe this isn't so wierd. I love them. I walk with them, dance with them. My jeans all sit perfectly on my hips, and now that I think about it, they're the only part of my body that I'm never worried about.    "Yes, they are nice, aren't they?"  I worry too much.

      I wish he would just be consistant. I feel like half of the time he's chasing me and the other half he's running away. Just when I need my father, he's not there. Just when I want to cry in his arms, because I cant' take it anymore, can't take  her  anymore, he's suddenly unavailable.   It's sort of like when you have an annoying admirer.  You're always giving him subtle clues that you want him to go away, and just when you need some admiration- he does.  And then you're just lonely, because you've got nowhere else to turn.   Isn't life ironic? In more ways than I can possibly list.  I've been wanting someone to get close to lately. Secretly longing for a relationship. And now, when there's a glimmer of potential; a small hope for something perfect, a whole slew of Mr. Wrongs throw themselves at me.  It's so tempting, but I know I just have to wait it out, because perfection is worth passing up some sort of fling.   Then again, who wants a fling anyway? I just have a problem with saying no. But I have self-control. I really do, I really can. It's just going to be difficult because my patience gage is on low.   Oh, the irony.

      As much as I complain about work I can't deny that the feeling I have after I get out of the shower and relax is wonderful, despite the aching muscles and the slight sunburn. A hard-days work really is worth something. The money and the tan help, too.  But, the best thing about work is the people. We have so much fun and entertain ourselves to no end. Despite the fact that we're walking constantly through fields of corn for 8 hours in cultivated soil with a 100 degree heat index, we have a blast.  We sing (off key), tell stories (crazy ones cuz the sun gets to us out there) and make retarded jokes (about wasps and chiggers and phrases that only make sense to us).   In short, we develop character. Garwoods is part of who we are. And I love it

      If you've been paying any attention to my comments lately, you know that there's quite a fued going on. I've deleted some of the comments, but there are a few still there. Those that were left were written by someone who's identity will remain anonymous, but I know who it was. And we're over it. The thing is, part of what she said, and what the other anonymous commenter (there are actually 3...but the third stuck up for me) said is true. The blog about the freshmen was rather...well, mean. I admit that. But you have to undrstand that most people say things they wish they hadn't when they're mad. And I was. So, I'd like to apologize to any new freshmen who read this (although, I dont' think any do). I am not, however, apologizing to anyone else. People read so much into 2 little sentences of a blog. The blog was about so much more than that. Also, that blog is not who I am. Those commenters acted as if my whole personality was sqeezed into that tiny blog. Hardly, those were just a few random thoughts. So, if this whole commenting thing doesn't clear up, I'm jst going to get rid of comments altogether. Maybe I can't take criticism....

      The Dance Factory had their recital last night and I was there. I thought it would be fun- and it was, but it caused a twinge of jealousy as well. I hadn't been to dance class for a long time due to cheerleading taking up most of my time this past year. I saw these girls (and guys) up there having so much fun and I realized how much I missed it and how big a part of my life dancing actually is.   So my new little adventure is going to be taking hip hop classes. Something to get wraped up in. Does anyone else do that? Do you search for things to pour yourselves into? I have a few. This blog, for instance. God, guitar, poetry, friends. Notice anything? They're all releases. Ways to escape from this place, these patterns, this life.   Don't we all need that? We all just need something to  be , below the surface.

      I've been banned from the computer, which is the reason for my lack of blogging. Misunderstanding between Mama and I.  This was the same kind of misunderstanding that also keeps me from goign to CIY, although I had all the money, all the papers, everything planned out. Parents are evil.  So here I sit. AIM isn't as fun as I remember it.   Someone please shoot me if I start writing about the graduates again.  The subject's been beaten to death and I'm sick of hearing (and writing) about it.   I am now a sophomore. I don't want to be. I don't want to deal with younger people, and their lack of knowledge. Although you all had to deal with me, I'm not as patient. I'm sure a few of them will be wonderful. And we'll mold them into little versions of ourselves, maybe they'll even teach us something. But the majority will just be annoying and immature. The same as they were last year.   Why am I so negative? I need a happy pill.

      What can I say about this place? It's boring and uninspiring and people judge you on how much money you have, and what your last name is, and what sports you play, and what clothes you wear, and the grades you get.   So how do you deal with it? Change it. That's my motive...I'm goign to change it...or at least ignore it. I'm going to live life how I want to and screw what the rest of you are doing. We have to make the best of what we're given...and instead of trying to conform so that Taylorville will accept me, Taylorville is going to change so that I am acceptable. So that  everyone  is acceptable.   Do you ever stop and think about how much we judge people? Some people's judgement is more obvious than others, but all of us judge. I've done it many times.   Scenario One: You're walking down the hall and some girl smiles at you. She's not pretty, nor is she popular, nor does she wear Abercrombie clothes. What do we do? Ignore her. Or smile back, slightly, without making a scene.   Scenario Two: You're walking down the hall and some girl smiles at you. She's pretty, popular, and you can spot  Abercrombie   sprawled on her t-shirt from 15 feet away. What do we do? Wave, smile, say [or yell] hey_____________!(fill in name of beautiful, popular girl).   You know why? Cuz we care so fricking much what the citizens of po-dunk Taylorville think about us. I'm not saying we're all horrible people. These reactions are second nature, but can't we change how we behave? Is anyone  really  going to think less of you because you say hi to the girl in the first scenario? No, and if they do, that's their problem.   Let's change Taylorville. I dare you.

      Something Corporate.  The only word that does them justice is  amazing . No, not even amazing suffices.   I used to listen to  Leaving Through The Window  daily. I needed my fix....then (dun dun dun) I lost my cd. For the past few months I have been Hurricaneless, Punk Rock Princessless, even Fallless (minus my pathetic version on the guitar with vocals by yours truly.)   Then, just yeterday I recoverd it from my Dad's. Thank God. As I popped it in the computer all the emotions came flooding back....the feeling I get from this music is unexplainable. It's sadness...but with hope. It's love and hate combined. It's like everything I've ever experienced wrapped up in 14 4-minute songs, and more.    Then their's Konstantine. Words can't describe.  So this is my tribute to Something Corporate:   "...She wants someone to see her. She needs to hear she's beautiful. She's beautiful..."     " ...Maybe when I'm done with thinking...maybe you can think me whole. Maybe when I'm done with endings this can begin...."    "...I've never been so lost. I've never felt so much at home.....Maybe I do, maybe I don't, but I know I haven't yet. And here I am..."     "...You watch your life go past. You wonder if you should..."       " ...Maybe I could live forever if not ever I had known that you'd be waiting there whenever I am all alone..."     "...You'll stop at nothing but the real thing and everything up to that's pretend..."       "...I've been watching stars coming off the wall, and maybe if I'm lucky I could catch them before you fall. And you are not alone..."       "...You'll never scream so loud as I want to scream with you..."     "...I want to hang onto something that won't break away or fall apart, like the pieces of my heart..."     "...You dont' do it on purpose, but you make me shake..."     " ...I've been climbing ladders through time. I've got tunnel vision, but I'm doing fine..."     "...Dream about things that I cannot say. You always said destiny would blow me away. Nothing's gonna blow me away..."     "...I close my eyes Thought I was lost, but I was stranded..."     "...Hours to be with you, minutes of me in you and I can't feel this happening..."    "....Pull me under your weather patterns- your cold fronts and the rain don't matter, because a sun burns what I needed..."

I'm sure when all is said and done I'll go home feeling lonely, and you will have had your fun..."     "....Nothing's the same when you give it away. No, it's not what it seems, it's just what you think it is...."     "...Taking steps back through the words I should've said to you.   Well, I feel sick, and you just dont' care anymore..."    "...How can you ask for me to stay when all you ever do is go?...Go on, you've kept me waiting. Go on and watch me as I fall..."    "...I want to feel you breathe me...why won't you believe me?..."     "...Dreams came around you in a hazy rain. You open your mouth wide to feel them fall..."     " ...Shake down you make me break. For goodness sake I think I'm on the edge of soemthing new with you..."      "...She stands a stranger in her skin...these words consume her, but hey never set her free..."      Can you think of anything more beautiful? I know I can't. And by the way,  love is real , for  those of you  who've recently told me differently.

      Just got back from Jenny Reber's house. Another graduation party...another reminder.  Casual conversations with  casual friends, food, breezy and (finally) warm weather. Everything was just so laid back...I guess that's something I'm not used to with this group of friends, but it was pleasant, and just what I needed on a day like this.   In about a half hour Laura, Abe, and I are goign to the drive-n movies. Of course escorted by my stepmom, since none of us can drive. Daddy Daycare for the second time, but I'll live.   These sort of events make me feel like I'm coasting. Just the mellow summer thing. I'm not sure whether that's good or bad. It'll change, though...whether I like it or not. I'm startign work in a week or so...and I have CIY(Christ In Youth) in 2 weeks, which should greatly change my outlook, if I'm not mistaken. As much as I may complain about this summer, it's just started, and I really have been busy...especially for not having my own transportation. I like where all this is going....and I love these people.

      Graduation? An ending or a beginning?    It's an ending.   High School is such a big part of everyone's life. You always hear old people telling stories about  when they were in high school , and  back in the day . High school is what shapes you....it's what makes you who you are. If you think about it...every day, every hour, every conversation, every glance makes up who you will become, maybe in some unimaginably small way, but it does. As comfortable as you may be in any certain place in your life, Taylorville will always be just as comfortable, if not more so. You'll always have these memories. You'll always have these people. Because I think I am just bits and pieces of my friends....with a little  me  thrown in.  It's a beginning, as well.   It's a new start....a chance to recreate yourself...if that's what you want.  You're finally "an adult". That would be so refreshing...just to know that this is your time to shine. This is  life , real life. New people, new places, new situations. You have all these decisions that YOU get to make. How wonderful.  I'm sure I won't ever forget tonight. The actual graduation itself, Ramey's party afterward, the ride home with a recently acquired friend. I look forward to 3 more graduations, including my own.  Life is so amazing.

      Today God helped me realize how important it is  not  to give my heart away. At least not to undeserving people.    I was reading my bible today when I came across this verse :  Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life -Proverbs 4:23    I haven't been doing a very good job of that lately. I'm such an open person...I subject myself and my feelings to pretty much the world.  Well, maybe not  the world , but to all my faithful bloggers. I spill my guts so easily to friends....and even acquaintances. Then, when they give me that I-didn't-want-to-know look, I suddenly feel ashamed...even naive to think that they would, in fact, care.   I also discovered  urlLink this article  when browsing one of my favorite websites. It had almost the same message; don't be quick to give your heart away. This "lesson" has more significance for me than most of you realize, because I have a real problem with that. Letting my emotions go has almost always caused pain in the end, if not immediately.   In short, remeber to think about how what you do and say will effect, not just other people, but also yourself.

      My legs literally feel like jello...  Now I know where that phrase came from. I feel like I've wasted so much time being fake lately. Worrying about guys for hours that aren't even worth a second of my thoughts. Spending time with girls that just cause me to gossip and swear and be someone they want me to be....someone nowhere near what I really am. I've prayed for so long for a  real  best friend...for someone that I can not only have fun with, but someone I can really talk to, that understands me. It may not sound like much, but it's so hard, because once people get in so deep, they either don't understand, or they get scared. I'm too complex for the crowd...I need someone different.  I think I might have found her....she's smart and soo much fun to be around, a Christian, she's not even concerned with looking cool or fitting in and all of the other crap that typically goes along with being in high school. She's just real, and I love her for that. We've been friends for a while...but I want to be closer, I want more. Maybe this all sounds silly....but it's what I'm missing. I always rely on my boyfriends to be my best friends and when they're gone I feel like I have nothing. I need something. I need  you .

      Lately this blog has caused anything but good.  Just konfusion and hatred, embarrassment and akward situations.  It seemsto me as if I'm too open. I let you into my head, but most of you aren't ready for it, yet.  I'm actually not sure that any of you are or ever will be, because I can try to explain how I feel and the reasons why, but I cant' duplicate the cold stares, the warm glances, the tone of her voice, the hurt in his eyes, the way she smiles at exactly the right moment, or the comforting touch of a friend. These things just need to be experienced.  I can't even remember all the words that were or were not said, but I know the emotions that followed, and that's all I can do.  I can try to explain, but it still feels as if noone understands. Is there even a purpose anymore?

      You make me think, yet you konfuse me. You seem to be two people wrapped up in one and if you'd act like the person your writing says you are, I'd be in love.   You make me think, because your words are as beautiful as you say mine are. You konfuse me, because I never have any idea if you're writing about me. And if not, then who?  I've been told you have feelings for me, but...didn't you have feelings for them all the same? And I know what kinds of people they are. They're pretty, but shallow. So do you like me for the right reasons, or simply because you need someone to chase?  I want and need the answers.  At first, I wouldn't consider it...because I simply don't understand you. But the more I sit and think...the more I like the idea.  But, do I like it for the right reasons, or simply because I need someone to chase?  Maybe you and I are more alike than I thought. I need to know. If you care enough to read this, then answer me. You should know who you are.  If you don't care enough...then it's probably not worth it. I'll just wait to hear from you.

      I hate the way things work out. I go to the fair to watch the pagent...hoping I'll see him there. Actually he told me I would...he told me we'd meet up there. Well, I see him, but he's with  her.  God, why is he with her? She has a boyfriend, why is he with her?  Well, I guess she's pissed at me....yea " if I go anywhere near him it's gonna get violent" What is her problem? She broke up with him, she has a new man..why can't she let him move on? Well, it doesn't matter...I heard they left and screwed, and he didn't say as much as one word to me. If that's how he wants it, then good for him. I will not resort to being a bitch to get what I want. I hope he doesnt' think he'll show up at my house at 6:30 tonight. If so, he'll have the door slammed in his face. I can't believe that people can be like this. No morals, whatsoever. It's gonna take so much for me to trust? Are there  any  good guys out there?

      I'm sick of this lack of ambition. I always bring myself down and tell myself I can't be what I want to be. And here's what I've realized,  I can.  This realization brought to you by Jason Mraz, Mario Podeschi, and well....myself. I'm inspired by Jason's songs...and I was reading his journal, and he just goes for it. He "won't worry his life away". It's awesome.  I know what I want to do. I wanna write my own songs and play my guitar (and when I learn, piano) and sing and dance around on stage and talk to people. I wanna do theatre so I can sing and act and dance some more. I just want to do what I love...and I can. That's awesome. Mario told me that he'd be happy waiting tables at China Pavillion for the rest of his life as long as people would hold his hand. Isn't that beautiful?  Ahhhh......life!   I wanna get started right now.

      You  make me wanna scream and pull out my hair, so why oh why do I feel the need to be loved by you? I know before I even start to type that I'll end up hurt.   Even in the smallest way...I'll end up with my heart broken a thousand times over again, because as sad as it may be, you're the deepest thing I've ever had.  Ever.  It makes me want to laugh and cry and throw up all at the same time.   It makes me wanna regret the day I first IMed you. The day I smiled and waved after you yelled  "motorcycle"  down the hall.  What a pathetic code word, to think I found you romantic.  It makes me wanna regret the day we rode up to Springfield in Chad's truck. The way we held hands and I played with your hair from the backseat. When we flirted in Michael's like a happy couple while Chad picked put the poster frames.  It makes me wanna regret  playing footsie with you under the table at O'Charley's. And to think the real gentleman was siting across from me and not beside me, but I guess it's hard to see that through infatuation.  It makes me wanna regret kissing you when we got to your Dad's house and chasing you because I knew you liked it. It makes me wanna regret letting you call me your girlfriend, although you never asked.  It makes me wanna regret ever letting you touch me. It wakes me wanna regret  "I love you".  It makes me wanna regret putting on a show for your teenage hormones. It makes me wanna regret the prom invitation and Jone's soda night.  It makes me wanna regret doing things simply because you wanted me to.  It makes me wanna regret letting you break up with me the easy way.  It makes me wanna regret missing you for months afterward.  It makes me wanna regret Music Festival and giving you another chance.  It makes me wanna regret  The Matrix Reloaded  and O'Charley's all over again. It makes me wanna regret parking at the lake and letting you kiss me.  It makes me wanna regret the radio station and all that night entailed. It makes me wanna regret telling you it wasn't your fault when it was.  But, most of all it makes me wanna regret how honest I was with you, every sweet word I ever said, making you feel so good, and that huge chunk of my heart I'll never get back.  But, I can't regret them and I can't take them back, because they make me who I am. And after all of that you can still treat me like shit and make me believe I'm not worth your time? You can still make me cry and  feel wrothless.   Well, I've learned my lesson and from all of this. I'm better off than you are, except  I'll  find it hard to believe the next time I hear  "I love you".   Thank God I have one heck of a best friend to cheer me up.  And I know when she says  "I love you"  she means it.  You can't bring me down anymore....

      I've been unfaithful to this blog. I've been having an affair with a xanga site. It's disgraceful, I know, but xanga is so much more personal. It feels like home, because I trust the people that read it. I trust them with my emotions. When I trust you, you rip my heart out. You comment or IM me and distort my words. At least most of you...  But it seems like no one reads this anymore, anyway. Maybe that's a blessing in disguise. Maybe it will once again become my place to hide away. My place to not care. My place to just be. Or maybe not. I've found an awesome friend recently that's wonderful for that. He understands. He doesn't judge. And get this...he gives  good  advice. The kind that doesn't tear you someone down, but rather lifts them up and motivates them. And for that, I am very thankful.  I think that my lackof blogging lately(though in actuality has been slightly over two weeks) has actually been caused by lack of need. Lack of worry. I've been so happy lately, that I don't care to rant about life and it's problems. I don't feel the need to analyze and reanalyze...though there will always be things on my mind, I've found other, better ways of dealing with them.   I was so worked up Friday about something that happened...something I saw, but I was a little proud of myself, because rather than ranting and raving about it on here, I simply prayed about it. And you know what? I felt one million times better.   I know this thing has a purpose. Many purposes in fact....I'm just still working on finding mine.

      Bon Jovi party last night. We rocked it out.   It was the usual birthday stuff....swimming, pizza, cake, and presents.  But, not exactly the usual birthday party people....Oh no, these were  my  friends. We found about 16 uses for a rather...unatractive shirt and photographed all of them(You don't want to know). Then we rode around town (stonington) and out in the country in the back of a truck. JBaby drove. It was a stick and she wasn't very good....more fun for those of us in the back. Then we dropped by ThugCov's house and picked up a few games....Mad Gab, Saved By The Bell, and Girl Talk.  Mad Gab was fun, but I was a little bitter, because I'm awesome at that game and I didnt' win. Allison did. She will die. Then we played Girl Talk (a truth or dare game for pre-teens) and Ali took on a 10-year-old immature little girl personality which over the course of 2 hours developed a lisp and became drunk. We made a few phone calls (as instructed by the game) but seeing as how it was around 2 in the morning, all we got was the voice mail.  We finally went to sleep with 4 of us crammed in a tiny tent and aShibbs sleeping inside on the couch.   "Who says you have to be drunk to have fun?"  Well, Ali....since you act like you are, anyway....

      I just got out of the shower....hot water running down my back has never felt so good. I was so sore when I woke up...problem solved. I love showers.   I have to watch the kids, again....Blues Clues and Dora the Explorer from 7 in the morning to 5 at night. Wonderful. At least today they brought the X box. Besides Vice City & DDR on PS2 and James Bond on N64, I'm video game retarded. The kids play...I watch. Actually, I shouldnt' complain, it's a pretty easy job.  I make breakfast and lunch, solve arguments....give an occasional bath and that's about it.   Speaking of jobs...I'm just now remebering how much everyone that worked at the radio station hated it. I'm not sure if that's the usual "I hate my job" banter....or if there was something extra horrible about that place. We'll see....or maybe we won't? I'm going to apply at MAI and perhaps Angelo's, too. My sister's a manager/ computer programer at MAI...so that should help. My problem is that I'm not sure which I'd choose, if I had to. Probably the radio station....my thinking is that I can get a job at MAI pretty much any time.    Things to look forward to: Busy Weekend School-right around the corner Dashboard has a new CD out John Mayer and Something Corporate have CDs coming out soon Power Light Fest Jill's party Abe's party Trip to Jolliette   Life's pretty good....I'd like to keep it that way.

      I stopped by the radio station today....Wow, it's been a long time since I've been there. I turned in my application. Saw Randy Miller. He waved.  Good, he remembers me.  I met him once while hanging out with Ramey...I thought that'd help me get the job, as pathetic as it sounds. I've wanted to work there since I heard about the place...it just seems so cool...a radio station, though it's not a typical radio station and working there will by no means make me a dj. I'm nto sure if going there every day will haunt me or not....it might bring back too many memories. At least they'd be good memories...and I can make some more of my own. IF I get the job. Wish me luck....

      Can all of a person's emotions be defined by a band? If so, mine's definately Something Corporate.  Heath burnt me a cd with all of their unreleased songs...and so now I realize, once again, how awesome they are. But, somehow I'm always unhappy after listening to SoCo.  They bring back that one emotion...the one I've felt so many times, but only  really  felt once.  I run back to that emotion. I run back to that person...whether he knows it or not, I run back to him in my writing, in my daydreams, in my thoughts, in my tears....in everything.  I called him a few days ago.  His phone wasn't on. He didn't call back.  For some reason I just want him to care....I always want him to care, and the day that I don't might be the biggest accomplishment ever. I know the kind of person he is...and I realize the things he's done to me...but he's like a ghost. I'm haunted...and I can't escape. Pretending is the only solution right now...pushing it to the back of my mind...and pretending. Pretending so that I can move on...pretending so that I don't sound as pathetic as I really am...pretending for some sense of pride.    And you're probably sick of hearing this...and you're probably sick of me beating this to death....and you probably want to shake me until I realize what  a stupid baby I am. I know, because rereading this, that's exactly what I want to do.   Someone once told me that he could turn off his emotions. Well, baby, I just don't believe you. But, I often wonder  If it were possible, would I do it?  Probably not...because emotions are too precious to just give up like that. And I'd much rather feel like this than simply not feel. And I'd much rather stare at this computer screen with mascara running down my face than be in a car "cruising" or "rolling" or whatever the popular word is today, around the square worrying about how my hair looks and who's car has the loudest bass and the best effects and blahblahblah.   You know, I'd much rather be one of the "synthetics"....my new label...along with mario and jenny....i'd rather be  urlLink fake  with those people than "real" with the people who claim to know just who I am, when they have no clue.   heh...I needed to rant. I'm done. Jeremy says he's going to find me a good boyfriend. That'd be nice....I suppose. It won't happen. That'd be too perfect. The night is young, but these feelings are old and stale.

      * follow the yellow brick road*  Last night was so much fun. Samantha, Mario, Paul and I took a trip up to the Muni to see The Wizard of Oz, and despite the fact that we only saw about 1/4 of the stage we had an awesome time.  Actually....not being able to see the stage sometimes added to the hillarity. We got to hear, but not see, the tin man being oiled up....quite entertaining for our perverted adolecent minds.  Oh, and then there was the other line  " I've been here with this pole up my...[pause]...back forever."  All in all, it was an amusing night. We got all the way to Rochester, then had to turn back around for gas. Craziness. I look forward to more adventures...until then, I'm out.

       "The more  hope  you have, the more of a  hopeless  romantic you become"   So often my AIM conversatiosn spiral into tales of old loves, first kisses, magic moments, adventures,  dreams, longing, heartbreak, deceit, and tears. One of these magical conversations occured yesterday and made me realize how much of a hopeless romantic I actually am.  Mario questioned me as to why I keep chasing after the same guy, when twice he's proven himself unworthy.  I just have hope that things will work out...that things will end up perfect and it will be worth it. " I know how you feel...but, this is the ironic thing: The more  hope  you have, the more of a  hopeless  romantic you become." Exactly. I wanted to scream " EXACTLY!" It bothers me that I have so much hope and so much trust in situations that, to the average peson, are obviously not going to work out. He, however, wasn't bothered by the fact...he accepted it. I suppose acceptance would work out... if only I could find another hopeless romantic to hope with...to trust with...to be with. All I can do is  hope  for the best....

      I'm done with trying so hard and planning everything out, because it just doesn't work that way.  I'm sick of being serious all the time, therefore I will stop. I'm doing quite well...it's hard to drop everything you tried to make yourself be and just be yourself for once, but I think it's working out so far.  I think I need a break from this blog for a while...it never does me any good...I say it helps get my feelings out, but really it just makes things appear more dramatic than they actually are. So this is goodbye for a while...at least until I find some new inspiration. Miss me.

       Possibilities...    I love possiblities. They're something to think about, to dream about, to plan out...figure out which way works best. You have options. But with dreaming....it doesn't really matter who or what you dream about, you can always change your mind in the morning. Unless suddenly dream options become reality options...then you're faced with choices.   Choices I don't like so much...and I have a big one to make right now...or sometime in the near future. I don't want to hurt anyone...I just want what's best. But it's so hard when you can't even figure out your own emotions and people are telling you ten million things...and they all expect you to listen to them.   I just don't know what I want.

      Back to dance, and I couldn't be happier! Oh...I missed it so much. The Dance Factory is so much harder, so much more challenging, so much....better! I love the energy...the rush. I love how hard I work...I love feeling like I couldn't push it any further...and then I do. I love the feeling after, too....where you could just drink a gallon of water, lay down for 2 minutes, then get back up and do it all over again. I love dancing down the floor and smirking to Linkin Park...isnt' Linkin Park just so easy to smirk to? It just gives you this sexy, confident, bring-it-on look.  Oh! and dancing to Marilyn Manson...completely awesome. I would normally frown upon someone like Marilyn Manson...call him a freak and what not...but this song...this dance! I just love it. We move so fast you can barely keep track..and then swing our hips while Marilyn screams "Doll-dagga Buzz-buzz Ziggety-zag!" If I could live at the Dance factory, I would.

      I miss you more than words can say.  I moved on. For once it is not you who betrayed me, but I am the one doing all the backstabbing. You took me in. You accepted me. You made me something. You helped me through it all. You were a friend...but one day you caused me pain. So what did I do? I ran. As far as I could go. I was unfaithful. I found someone new. That someone made me lighthearted. That someone gave me hope. But, that someone also lacked what you had. That someone lacked your comfort. That someone lacked the experience that you and I had gone through together.   Xanga could never be you...My precious blog, you will always be my first love.

      I was reading Abe's blog and I saw the link: Kelsey. Thinking it would lead me back to my xanga site, I clicked. But it lead me here.   *The memories and melodies and I just can't take it*   Temptation.Maybe I'll write just  one  post. Just because I know you won't read it.    Life. Oh, i'm not sure what that means anymore. I have been up and down lately.&nbsp; Living in reality only about ten percent of the time.   So that leaves me ninety percent dreaming. And maybe I prefer it.   I'm not in control in real life, but in my dreams I can make you say whatever I want. I can make you do whatever I want. Haha...and oh the things you do in my imagination. You'd be embarassed, but you'll never know.    Never. Never. Never.    I'm hungry but not eating. Tired but not sleeping. Yearning but not living.     I'm leaving you for Chicago. Don't you dare try and stop me.

       i always come back.  always.  done with  urlLink xanga . it started out wonderfully, with a select few who knew of it. then, the whole world decided to use xanga. and it's just...missing that spark. when i blog it just seems easier, more real. so now, i'm retiring. i gave it more than a year of my time...so read, if you wish, it'll still be there.   as for this blog...i'm keeping all my old posts. some are embarassing, some reflect views i no longer hold, some are just retarded...but i'm trusting that all of you realize that people change.  don't worry, not  completely.

      last night i dreamt for hours (or at least what seemed like hours) that i was trying to stop at various stop signs. i'd press on the brakes in advance, as you normally would, except my car was unable to make complete stops. i'd creep slowly through intersections, then finally stop on the other side, only to accelerate and repeat the process. sometimes, cars would come close to hitting me and it turned into a game of how soon to break and accelerate in order to avoid crashing.  hmm. interpretations, anyone?

       trying not to get upset...     this day  was  good. really good. church with ben and meghan, then basketball, and best of all those few short minutes on his couch dozing off while holding hands.  then hip-hop, which always puts me in a good mood, and i'm back home. get a phone call from ben, "we're over at adam's...if you wanna come."  "er...hold on, lemme ask momers."  she said no. the reason being i don't have money to be wasting gas. well...actually, i have over 800 dollars in the bank, but whateva.  and i always feel like i'm being punished when these things happen. first of all; by ben. i get treated like i'm punking out, when really, i'd be there in an instant if i could. second of all; by my mom. she acts as if asking to do something she won't allow is ridiculous. so, the phrase "it never hurts to ask" doesn't really apply to me.  i know it's all a punishment for not having a job, yet. but...i don't think adults realize exactly how difficult those are to aquire. the catch is, when you  do  have a job, you don't have any time to be with your friends or do anything with the money you've earned. it's sort of a catch-22.  and all i really want is a little freedom.

       I  love  putt-putt, bowling, and nerds.    Ooh...and also: driving through the ghetto. Ben, Craig, and I were looking for Applebee's and we ended up on South Grand trying to look inconspicuous. Then Mim called Ben and said that she and Rob were eating at Chili's...so we navigated our way out of there like nobody's buisness and nearly froze to death. I guess they call it Chili's for a reason, eh? Anyway, there was an extremely loud gay man sitting at the table behind us with a big group of girls and the laughter was so loud we couldn't really have a conversation of our own until they left. So...what to do in Springfield on a Thursday night?  Why, putt-putt, of course. I am extremely happy that we ended up going to Nights Action Park last night, instead of "swimming" at Laurel's. No offense to her, I just wasn't up for the hooplah of half-naked socialization. It was still cold, but a low temperature is the perfect excuse for holding on tight to someone you can't get enough of.( Those are the little things that get me.)We played the Asian course when we could've played the Medieval course. I mean, I love Asians, completely, but the other course had a castle and a dragon and things like that. Easy choice. Unfortunately, we didn't realize it existed until the last hole. Well, Craig won, I came in second, and Ben definately lost. Even with all the cheating. Aww.  And tonight we went bowling. We consisting of Tori, Ben, and I. Tori's really friggin' crazy...I've known it all along, but I think I only completely realized it tonight. And she was flirting with my boyfriend! That whore! Eh...i didn't/couldn't really care, because she's 12 and my sister(niece). I'm pretty sure that's the way 12 year-old girls work, though. They flirt with anyone of the opposite sex. Good practice, I suppose. Bleh, then some drunk guys hit on me when I went to get a Dr. Pepper. "Hey...how are you doing?"  "I'm fine."  "Can I buy you a drink, sweetheart?"  "No. I'm fine."  "Hey, where's your boyfriend?"  "Actually, he's right over there."  Silence from the drunken idiots. Har.  As for the whole nerd thing: that's Ben...and Tori....and well, me. But mostly Brittan Rudolph. I just read most of her blog and plan to read it in it's entirety, eventually. Most of it was hillarious and I completely loved it. If you read this, Brittan, you get my nerdy seal of approval.  Ack. G'night folks.

       I like this one...     February 3, 2003    She hides behind her smile But she too has her fears. So afraid of being needed desperately for a few short moments Then forgotten.  Like a tissue, she'll be used and so easily discarded. Chocolate chip ice cream Old and freezerburnt Behind the strawberry he now finds more appealing.  Faded and full of holes That worn-out shirt he'd rather not touch. She can remember when he used to love it Several months earlier when it was bright and new.  She doesn't want to be Just another of the many Fish in his sea. She's been thrown in and out of too many ponds.  Are her feelings justified Or just paranoia? Most likely the second. She overreacts.  What ever happened to the optomist we used to know and love? She died. With the realization that life can't be As simple as she made herself believe.

       salvation army church  this morning.  my aunt lissa became a "soldier", and we were invited for the ceremony. it was the smallest church i'd ever seen in a neighborhood that was borderline ghetto. ghetto-ish, if you will. the accompianists played trumpets and the church was lively and informal. during offering, several people gave as little as pennies, but i knew, just from the atmosphere, that it was appreciated. service was lead by a woman from australia and a man from south africa. they're married and have two adorable children. after church, we all went to lunch at ryan's steak house. "we all" meaning my family and half of the church. i wish i could retell the stories. it's something that sounds simple, perhaps boring, but i was compeltely interested. as well as proud and happy for my aunt lissa. she's found something that makes her so incredibly fulfilled...and that's the most anyone could ask for.   "hey, i got this outfit at the salvation army!"   hahaha. er...she's also incredibly cheesy.

       home late, again.      only a half an hour. that boy makes me never want to leave. and all we did was play video games and eat mcdonald's at craig's.  i think that's my favorite combination: ben, craig, me. we compliment each other perfectly. i don't feel like i'm ignored or ignoring someone else. we do it all; late-night conversations, hackey sack, hackey sack  fights , video games, trips to springfield, 5a.m. bike rides. i wish summer could last forever. i wish mom would go camping again so that i could stay out all night. i wish that i could just stop time when we're lying in criag's living room talking about our dreams and our futures.  so now i'm just wondering how i got along without them for so long.  that includes jeff and rohan, as well. i love my boys.
