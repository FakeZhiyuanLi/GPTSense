      Great  urlLink gizmo ! Measuring 45.7 (W) x 49.4 (H) x 18.2 (D) mm and weighing 55g, comes with stereo earphones that act as an antenna. It runs on a built-in rechargeable 500mAh lithium-polymer battery for about an hour, most of the sites still called it a wrist-watch, we all know its basic use is changed from checking out time to watching television, it could have been anything Portable TV, Wrist Television or Wearable TV as the above one says, anyways great one, i would want one of these.

      Well we can also call it Rock + Alternative, band members from these two great bands GNR(Slash, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum) and STP(Scott Weiland) combine to form Velvet Revolver, after reading a few articles found out that there have been lots of controversies to get the band where it is today, but then it paid them well and gave us good music, "Slither" one of the tracks is already in the top five on the rock charts.  Though most of the reviews said that its not like GNR neither like STP i think its got more of STP in it, might be because the Lead singer is from STP.  Bottom line Velvet Revolver is more inclined towards Alternative, Great music.

      yes, i am talking about the ad that comes on MSN Messenger, what made creators of MSN Romace think the "Will you marry me?" label on MSN Messenger with some slutty image attract people to "MSN Romance",going to MSN Romance with the intentions of marrying someone...thats the last thing one would do, the ad would have been better for some porno site with some change in the label text :-).

      Maniratnam does it again, after a long time i found a reason to go and watch a bollywood movie, Rehman gave his best again, if you are used to the usual crap of bollywood the family stuff, those huge sets, exceptionally crappy music then this movie is not for you. mob scene at the police station is amazing. The story lineup is more like some hollywood movie but it worked, very well presented, well a few songs were completely unnecessary.  With huge movies from both ends coming up like Day after tommorow, Hell boy etc.. this movie will definately make its place.

      Yahoo 6.0 beta surprised everyone not only with its slick looks but also with addition of LAUNCHcast, using which we can listen to some great music online, though its partially free i think its more than what you can expect from your messenger, LAUNCHcast has a good classification of stations and i guess more important is the way it figures out your bandwidth and gives you the quality accordingly making sure that you dont get breaks.       One feature which i found really impressive is the create your own station option, which allows you to select your type of songs from a vast collection of genres/artists, this is a good option if you are at work place and do not have any of your MP3's from your collection around, which is not the case with me so i prefer listening to one of the offered channels, thats what i like about radio random songs, and that way you find some good music which is not a part of your collection.       Well as other online radio channels ads do keep coming and get buggy after some time but as we all know if there are no ads its no more free, you are allowed limited skips in the free version, but i prefer listening to whats queued, and if the music hurts you that bad to skip the song then you haven't selected the right station.

        I think these guys did a good job this time, well "How you reminded me" from their last album Silver side up got them on the billboard charts but the rest were just average songs, this time they have got a lot more good music with The Long Road, my fav from the list are  1.Someday 2.Shouldve listened 3.See you at the show  4.Saturday nights alright.[no its not the "all songs starting with "S" thing" :)] Someday is the best from the list, their cover of Elton john - Saturday nights alright sounds more like a foo fighter song though. Great music, much much better than their previous album.

       urlLink    Nokia 2300, Phone looks nice [the grey-silver model ONLY!!], but thats it, this a new release in the budget phone market, the only feature added in this model advanced to the older budget models is that you can listen to FM Radio using the phone, well nowadays you get hands free kit which offers this facility and they are nice and cheap, they why would one buy this phone spending extra 2 to 3 K, they have also cut down the feature of picture editor that used to be in the previous budget models, well overall i think the only plus point about this phone is the looks which kind of gets it a bit high in the range of other Nokia budget phones about the FM feature i can get it arranged on my Nokia 3310 too.

      If you are a programmer working on Microsoft technologies, then  urlLink KBAlertz  is the right site for you, recently while googling i came across this site, it has almost all the articles published in MSDN, I know you can get them at Microsoft.com or from your installation of MSDN, well then here is what i like about this site, during my registration on this site it allowed me to choose the technologies i would be interested in getting KBAlertz for and i will be receiving thru mails if there are any new bug fixes, solutions for known problems or code snippets in the technologies that i selected, well its not always useful, but i think this helps you know the latest developements happening around in the technologies that you are working on, and if gets too spammy then like a few of them KBAlertz also provides the sweet option of Unsubscribing from their mailing list :)
