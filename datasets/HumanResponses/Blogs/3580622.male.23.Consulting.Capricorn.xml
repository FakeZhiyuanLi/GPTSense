      been a few days since i wrote my first blog. so, i figured i'd write another.  spent last evening in the burbs at a friend's house.  it's weird, i'm constantly reminded how uncomfortable i feel in certain situations.  don't really know what those situations are, but undeniably i feel uncomfortable.  i think it's being around what we'll call from now on "cha". cha could be a person, a thing, or simply a shirt... bahahah, that's not random at all!?!  no, but seriously, cha causes some issues for me at times. it's weird.  spent today by the pool.  got me a sunburn, shocking becuase that happens about everytime i go outside.  i'm looking forward to hanging out in the skin cancer ward of the hospital in a few years.    update: nope, still haven't found the love of my life. thanks for asking.  here's a question for you... is it wrong to be upset if a close friend doesn't really take an interest in your life?  i mean, what if you really make an effort with your closest friends to ask them about what's happening in their life and try to be a part of that.  and what happens when that very same friend whom you try to share in their highs and lows turns out to never ask you (read: me) about your own life?  it would be once to have "friend" ask me life (job, dates, etc...) or anything really... it's kind of frustrating.   i think it all boils down to the fact that i just wish someone out there would be interested in me... (wow, that's just sad)  things are good though, i had a good day... would have preferred a better evening... but ya know what... i'm ok with that :)  tomorrow will be busy... off to find an activity...

      so... this is my attempt at starting a "blog"... i don't even know what this will entail, nor will i have any idea where it will go  i'll start i guess by describing my day.  i woke up at 7:15, i didn't go running today - it was a long night so i said, "no way".  it only takes me a half hour or so to get ready in the morning, so i generally take my time since i don't have to be at work until 8:30.  the metro was crowded this morning. luckily, everyone on my train decided to look extra hot.  one guy in particular, i liked him.  we'll call him "tie".  he had a nice tie and generally that means that he's quite an intellectual. (i know it doesn't really mean that, i can pretend, ok?)   work was dull.  my boss keeps asking me when i might leave... i told her i need a new job first. it's kind of odd how she doesn't seem to mind that i hate my current job. oh well.  SM and i spent the greater part of our days fighting over where our hotel should be in LA.  he seems to think one place and i another.  sometimes i wonder what makes our friendship work.  at times we are so similar, but at other times we are quite opposite.  similarly i want to hug him at some times and others, rip his throat out - ha ha good thing i'm not dramatic :) he's a good friend though, so i cannot wait for our trip to L.A.   i'm spending the rest of my night doing laundry and looking for a new jobby job... wish me luck!
