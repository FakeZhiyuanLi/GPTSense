         To Whom It May Concern:  After months of trying to accept my new position, I have come to the conclusion that I do not like my job working with still photography and the clients that float and flaunt around the studio. It's time I moved on. The cosmetics industry is especially superficial. Of course, putting on makeup in order to feel great is superficial. I don't care who looks hideous on the covers of which magazines. I don't care who is the latest and the greatest. I don't care about the art directors that specialize in passing the buck. I don't care about the photographers that have the best equipment. I just don't care. I'm horrible at pretending to care, so I should just move on. By the way,  urlLink Paris Hilton  makes my left eye twitch, even though I just don't care.  Sincerely, The Unable To Be A Fauxhemian

        I found this card created by Gerhard Haderer, a German cartoonist, in an antique card shop today. It doesn't seem like a vision of the past.

        I've been feeling very domestic these past few months. Items made from scratch: blue berry pie and a rub for the ribs (my sister loved that). People to enjoy: Scott, Jason, and  urlLink Dee.

      Here is something I was asked to do, but wasnâ€™t allowed to post it because it had to be at most 150 characters...  Random Demand:  The children are waiting! Please tell them the story about the bald frog with the wig:  One year, the pond dried up so a hungry frog sat at the edge of the road hoping for a fly to fall off the windshield of a long-distance truck. When no trucks appeared, he noticed a dead squirrel in the middle of the road. Some flies were buzzing around, so he ate them all. The next day, he was hungry again, so he hopped over to the dead squirrel, but no flies were around. He decided to put on the dead squirrel and hop around in order to attract flies. He looked kinda like sickly green man with a wig on. A young lady noticed him and stopped to pick him up.  "You poor homeless man. Why don't you come with me and I'll clean you up." The frog thought (Why not?), and went with the young lady. It was near night fall, so the frog had the desire to sing.   The young lady said, "My, you are very talented. I know this producer that could get you a job as a singer!"  The frog thought (Why not?) and sang the next day for the producer. The producer liked him so much, that he made him the latest pop star. All the boys and girls bought all of his t-shirts and hit singles making him millions.  But the frog became bored. His now dry-cleaned dead squirrel was no longer smelly enough to attract the kinds of flies he wanted. He was just constantly surrounded by pop star fanatics. So the frog decided to take the dead squirrel off of his head and put on a freshly killed dead skunk.  Nobody liked his new look and he became very smelly. All the pop star fanatics started talking about how odd he became and stopped buying his records. Within months, the frog went bankrupt.  Homeless again, he just shrugged and went back towards his dried up pond with the dead skunk on his head. This time there were tons of flies buzzing around for him to eat. He wasn't bored anymore and his singing attracted other frogs with which he could share his flies.

        The summer is flying by. Being locked up in a studio all day seems to put time into stasis. I just realized today that the sun is going down earlier, reminding me that it is nearly time for a change of season...   Before I go into yet another metaphor about seasons and life cycles, I can't help but think about the yellow police tape, fire engines, hellicopters, and ambulances blocking off a good portion of my neighborhood the other day. I thought I could sneak across to get to the subway right around the corner, but the police ran at me yelling, "Hey you! Can't you see the tape!"  "Sure, but why can't I go just over there?" Being preconditioned to terrorist activities, I thought it was just another false alarm, like the other tens of times I have seen bomb threats. But this time was different. The police were very hyper and would not answer questions from anyone. They redirected our block of commuters to go down a block in the opposite direction and walk around the taped off blocks of streets to get onto the subway on the other side. We white-knuckled the trip under the river and to our destinations into Manhattan.  When nothing happened, we just went about business as usual, working more than 8 hours, as usual, and coming home late to witness an impending change in season.
