						    urlLink My second Malory Towers quiz is now online . I recommend playing as a member at FunTrivia, because then your scores are saved. But if you don't care about that, just have fun and play as a guest!  I am leaving Trondheim (where I go to university) in five days, after handing in my papers, packing and cleaning. I hope I'll get the chance to stop by here (and my two other blogs) during the summer, but I don't know how much internet time I'll get.  Have a nice week!

						   I'm liking this new blog so much, I'm posting yet again. I think all the new Blogger functions are great, with the list of recent posts and the comments built into the template (I used to have to get my comment templates from places like  urlLink Haloscan , which are good, too). But it's very practical when the comments come with the templates. I think Blogger has improved a lot. I haven't been over at  urlLink Blogskins  for a suitable template, either - I found one that was just right, right here at Blogger. I think the brown goes well with the Malory Tower theme, don't you? I mean, considering that the school colours at Malory are brown and orange. I probably should put in a little orange, too.  I have also added a link to a Malory Towers fanlisting. It's right there, on the left-side menu, in green. I probably will add some more links in the future.  I would also like to take a moment to recommend a great site called  urlLink FunTrivia . You can take quizzes on all topics, including Malory Towers and other Enid Blyton books! I recently submitted a Malory quiz of my own - it's on book five, "In the Fifth at Malory Towers". You can play it yourself, just  urlLink follow this link . You can either get an account or play as a guest.

						   For my first proper post to this blog, I'm going to show you the result from a test I took at  urlLink Quizilla :    Occassionally prone to fits of temper, but liked by staff and students alike. You are straightforward, honest, good-hearted Darrell.     urlLink   Which Malory Towers character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I'm pretty pleased with this result, seeing as Darrell probably is my favourite character. I know it's somewhat unoriginal, but there you go.

						   This is my first post to this blog dedicated to Malory Towers. This is just to see what it will look like. I'm not too sure about the title "Cornish Sunsets", but it will work for now.  More later!
