      Now if this doesn't scare the pants off you, I don't know what will.   urlLink U.S. Expels Iranians Seen Filming Bridges, Landmarks   The summary is that two security guards assigned to Iran's U.N. mission were expelled after they were seen filming the Statue of Liberty and NYC subways, among other things.  State warned the mission multiple times, but Iran is up in arms over the expulsion.     So now, the nation with nuclear capabilities (at the very least a whole bunch of nuclear material, mostly weapons-grade) has people acting in the U.S. under their government's charter, taking pix of yet another high-visibility, high-impact target for a potential attack.  Great.    The only plus for this is that they were found.  How were they found?  They were registered agents of a foreign country in the U.S.  Short of a neon sign, they were clearly identified from the get-go.  Anyone else still frightened by the state of national security?  Eeek!  You know, my cousin flew that humanitarian mission to Iran after the Bam earthquake -- The first US government plane to touch ground there since the hostages were released in 1981.    And I know we have to be the bigger state, as it were -- That we, because of our freedoms and better way of life, should look out for others less fortunate because the governments are whom we oppose, not the citizens.  But in this case, I think any country that has had any sort of hand in terror aimed at the U.S. -- State sponsored or otherwise -- should be restricted from letting anyone come into this country.  No Somalis, no Saudis, no Iranians, no Iraqis (until recently), no Indonesians, the list could go on and on.  Now, that might not be that big an issue until you then disallow the use of U.S. funds in any efforts in those countries not directly administered by NGOs.  Now, you have no emigration and no way to feed, house, or otherwise care for these people.  I would think these governments would quickly get on board and make every attempt to wipe out terror roots in their countries.

      I've gotta think, as good an idea as it might have been to keep the ceremony safe, ultimately it failed to accomplish the one major objective -- To let the Iraqi people as well as the world at large see that the future of the country is in the hands of Iraqis.     To keep this behind closed doors was the mistake.  It was very smart to sneak it in ahead of plan -- Like the best of surprise parties.  And at least they did the formal ceremony swearing in the government on TV, but not showing Bremer handing over the keys, as it were, might come back to haunt us.  Iraq has had a governing council, so the nuance of Iraq now having a government might not be perceptible to the world -- It's that much easier to still be seen as an arm of the U.S. government if people did not see Bremer release control.    Not generally subscribing to conspiracy theories, I find the press calling out that Allawi asked to move it up very interesting.  One thing I'd worried about was the potential effect on U.S. markets to have the FOMC raise interest rates at the same time as violence erupting around the handover in Iraq.  Well, I guess now that's not a worry.  And Bush looks all the better at the NATO summit as well -- The summit is only a two-dayer, so Bush and Blair would not have been among those decision-makers on Wednesday if the handover happened as scheduled.

      What rock have I been hiding under?  I was checking news just now and what pops up, but an ad for  The Manchurian Candidate .  How did I not hear before that they are remaking this?!  Looking at the synopsis, they are updating the story line to be more contemporary.  But even with a cast like Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, you can't match the performances and unforgettable character portrayals of Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury.    And that's not even starting to talk about the culture of the time during which the original was released.  There is no Red Plague anymore and the paranoia of the HUAC and Army-McCarthy Hearings are long since gone.  As the remake is set in the Gulf War, what paranoia of the time can add to the dynamic of the film?  It's ridiculous.    It seems that trailer after trailer lately is for an old movie being remade or used as a platform.  It started with Psycho -- Why didn't they know to stop after that fiasco?  I love Steve Martin, but no one can play Clouseau like Peter Sellers.  And don't get me started about this Garfield movie -- If it's not a cartoon and doesn't have Lorenzo Music's voice (Carlton the Doorman), then it isn't Garfield.       There's nothing new under the sun, but please stop ruining all those old, great things under the sun already.      To see the website for the movie, visit  urlLink The Manchurian Candidate

      So, I was in a restaurant the other day at lunch time and was disgusted to find, after I sat down to eat, people smoking.  Per the Illinois Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990 (yes, I looked it up), a smoking section must be separated from the non-smoking area and every effort has to be made to keep air from circulating between the two.  I asked the manager if smoking was permitted and he said it was in that corner of the restaurant (right under the ceiling fan, of course).  So, I e-mailed the establishment when I got home on Thursday night.  The response I received (Saturday night, though the website guaranteed a response within 24 hours) is the WORST thing I've ever seen.           Hi Mary Beth   My name is Spiro owner of Zippys Restaurants your correct about that I will make it a point to fix this problem immeadiatly I personally was a smoker that has quit for years and it bothers me very much your the first complaint about this and 1 complaint is to many so im changing the dining room to no smoking   Thank You   What is this -- A Where's Waldo for grammar and spelling?!  How many mistakes can you find?  Yeah, so I'll be flocking there some time soon!  Thanks for the thoughtful response and the effort to make the customer happy.

      Hi, I'm Beth, and I'm a scuba diver.  (all together, now, "Hi, Beth!")  Yes...  It's an addiction.  I haven't been diving nearly as much as I'd like to for a few reasons (economics of being unemployed, hating cold water and living in Chicago, and losing touch with my scuba guru, for example).  But it's in my blood and a day doesn't go by that I don't think about my scuba experiences thus far as well as looking ahead to my next trip (which will be a while).     I have two distinct favorite places so far.  The first is Roatan, Honduras, specifically  urlLink CoCoView Resort .  This is an all diving, all the time experience.  There are boat dives to start the morning and afternoon, returning to drop you off at either wall or the wreck right in front of the resort for your second dive of the session (or they'll take you back home).  There's unlimited shore diving and some great sites, including Calvin's Crack.  Many tout Mary's Place (also a crack, but you can't really name a site Mary's Crack, now can you?) as the best site, but I prefer Calvin's Crack.  Other than diving, there's not much else to do besides hang out with divers (though they have added workout facilities and a spa and have always had kayaks and other things to fill time), but it's a great, rustic resort with cabanas over the water.  For me, Roatan is equally about memories.  My first trip there was outstanding!!!  Though we had no luggage for 5-1/2 days of 7 (thanks again, Continental), it was a great bunch of people and we had  SIX  whale shark encounters.  The first was after my 11th logged dive -- No wonder I'm hooked!  The second is Cozumel, Mexico.  This is a whole different approach to diving as well as dive vacationing from Roatan.  Here, you'll go out on the boat for a couple of dives, then come in and hang out.  Whether you stay at a resort (whatever you do,  don't  go to the Reef Club) or stay at a little hotel in town (for something on the order of $40 a day, you get a room with a shower, fridge, A/C, and beds and maybe a pool) and hang out in the square.  As well, the diving itself is different, namely it's drift diving.  This is great for the lazy folk out there (like my dad) who don't really want to swim.  You drop in, the current takes you where it wishes, and when you surface, poof, the boat is there (provided you have a good captain -- bring a signalling device just in case).  My last trip there (which was my last trip to now) on our last dives we had an outstanding experience on the South End, Punta Sur.  We did Devil's Throat (a cool swim-through, but an advanced dive) as well as Maracaibo.  Maracaibo is pristine, because it's such a haul from anywhere that operations won't take you down there, and we saw turtles (my favorite) up close and personal.  If you can get a boat driver that has a full tank of gas, a fast boat, and is accepting of fiscal incentives, it's worth a shot.    My most exotic diving experience was a live-aboard in Palau.  We did the Big Blue Explorer, and I wasn't impressed.  The ship and facilities were fine enough, and the people were nice, but the dive operation itself seemed to me to be ill-prepared and unfamiliar with the local diving conditions.  They'd only been there for six months, and they briefed us off sheets that locals had written for them.  Except, they didn't tell us about the potential conditions as outlined on the sheet, preferring to brief us based on what they'd seen in the past few months.  One in particular, we found out later, was known on occasion to have nasty upcurrents but because they hadn't seen them, they didn't tell us about them.  And guess who showed up that day?  Mr. Nasty Upcurrent.  Next time, if I'm flying 22 hours to go diving, I'm going to Truk Lagoon or the Great Barrier Reef.    But I'm glad I did it.    Are you a diver?  Do you want to learn more about diving?  I wanna hear about your experiences and start an open discussion for divers of all levels -- Experiences, dive spots, equipment, you name it.

      You gotta believe!!!  I mean, really...  Let's look at the season so far.  We have yet to play a single regular season game with all our expected roster players active.  Prior didn't start a game until June.  Wood and Borowski went down, while Remlinger worked his way back from surgery.  Grudzielanek and Gonzalez were hurt (and that's the whole middle infield).  Sammy, well, don't get me started; I'd rather see Hollandsworth in right on a regular basis -- The guy's got a helluva bat as well as excellent range and a never-say-die approach in the field.  And after all that, we're approaching the All-Star break in second in the NL Central, 3 games behind St. Louis.     And let's talk about the new players.  Michael Barrett is a standout among the new starters.  He's really picked up his defensive play, while coming through in clutch at bats.  Lee is starting to add some offense this month to his outstanding play at first.  And there's absolutely no way you can single out a bench player.  Everyone has stepped up to the plate, as it were.  Now, if only we can keep our staff healthy (and get Gonzo and Wood back soon), stop stranding base runners, and keep Wendell Kim from running us out of innings and ballgames, we'll be unstoppable!  So, I was wondering...  What happens in October, Game 7 of the Series against the BoSox, game tied in the bottom of the 9th at Wrigley, bases loaded with two outs and a count of 3 and 2?  Here's hoping that's something I get to see!!!

      As I like to find out as much about a story or issue as possible before I make up my mind, I get my news from many sources.     Online, I use My Yahoo!  It's a great portal, serving up news from AP and Reuters as well as  USA Today , the  Washington Post , and the  LA Times .  As well, there are international sources available, so I can see how things are playing overseas and what they find newsworthy.  As well, I enjoy Fark.com.  Submitters supply links to news stories from various sources and there are associated threads for each story.  What I don't like about Fark is that it's not an intimate group of people and there are nasty trollers (or just trolls) about.  Just when you think a discussion is interesting enough to join, someone starts personal attacks or spouting propaganda (left or right).  So, ideally, I'd love to have Fark-like discussions here, without the ickiness.  I subscribe to the Chicago Tribune online as well as the  NY Times  (NYT) and  Christian Science Monitor  (CSM).  I'm also a frequent visitor to MSNBC and use their Alert service on my work e-mail account.  Daily I have the  NYT  and  CSM  headlines sent to my e-mail as well as MSNBC's  First Read .  Each of these provides previews of the stories for that day, with  First Read  having a political focus.    As far as network news goes, well now that I'm working again, I'm usually not home in time for the 5:30 national shows.  Regardless, I haven't been able to watch Dan Rather since 28 January 1986 and Peter Jennings I can only take in small doses.  So that really leaves NBC.  And WGN is my source for Chicago news (and sports, but that's a different post!).   What is great is that I've found an outstanding news program on MSNBC at 7pm CT (with a rebroadcast at 11pm CT) called  Countdown with Keith Olbermann .  They provide the canned stories from NBC News, while providing additional insight, guests, and discussion as well as some of the goofier stories -- Something they can accomplish in the hour-long format that the national half-hour doesn't allow.  As well, the host is smart and witty, with an acerbic sense of humor; no one is safe, left, right, or otherwise.  The differentiator for me is that he writes his own material; he's not simply a news reader.  And it's very evident.    If you have any other great sources for news, I'd love to hear them.  As G.I.Joe said, "Knowing is half the battle."

      It's gonna come out some time, so I might as well start it off right here.  I tend a little right of center.  But I take issue by issue and weigh out the facts, and I don't subscribe to a platform unquestioningly.  I do support the war in Iraq, not in the context of the war on terror, but rather to carry out what the UN should have done at some point over the past 14 years.  There... I've said it.    I'm generally a patriotic type -- I know how to properly hang a flag, for example.  That's partly due, I'd guess, to the number of members of my family and friends of the family who were or are now in service to their country and/or communities.  Heck, I thought the Air Force was the place for me for a while (and occasionally I'm not sure if staying out was the right choice).    But my cousin is currently serving in the Air Force.  He's an Academy grad, having served active duty for about 10 years.  His reserve unit was called up in November and he's flying in the Iraq theater of operations.     I am completely amazed by how wonderful he is, writing all of us, putting us at ease, caring for us while he's over there.  He takes the time to answer questions I have.  He closes his notes with words of encouragement for me, where I can only close with a joke (think cold thoughts... Minot...  Elmendorf...).  He's encouraging me when he's doing what he's doing where he's doing it.    To my cousin and all those in service -- Here or overseas, now or in the past -- I am truly grateful for your amazing sacrifices.

      Hey!  This is my first foray into the wonderful world of blogs.  I once played on a message board, enjoying the intelligent conversation from varying points of view on news and sports and life in general, but things got, well, ugly.  So I'm hoping we can have some thoughtful discussions about everything I find interesting.  That's, as the title would suggest, news, sports, scuba diving...  Etc. would comprise life, humor, and the like.    So, feel free!  I'm a big fan of open, honest communication.  And one thing I hate...  nastiness!

      It had been in the rumor mill for weeks now, but in the waning moments before the trade deadline, the Cubs have wrapped up the deal for former BoSox SS Nomar Garciaparra according to  urlLink Cubs.com .  And no wonder it took so long -- It's a four-team trade that off-loads a slumping, but fan favorite, Alex Gonzalez.  I know my sister will be heartbroken.     Not because she follows sports at all -- She once met B.J. Armstrong during the Bulls Dynasty of the '90s and didn't know who he was.  But she thought Alex was far and away the cutest Cub.  As did others.    Here's how the deal breaks down.  The Cubs traded a minor league lefty pitcher to the Twinkies for Doug Mientkiewicz.  Mientkiewicz and Gonzalez were traded,along with infielder Brendan Harris and pitcher Francis Beltran, by the Cubs to the Sox.  The Sox then dealt Garciaparra and an upstart outfielder (and a handful of cash) to the Cubs while passing Gonzalez, Beltran, and Harris to the Expos for a Gold Glove infielder.  You get all that?  Other big name trades happening before the deadline included ChiSox's solid Esteban Loaiza traded for shaky Yankee starter Jose Contreras and the Diamondback's Steve Finley heading to the Dodgers.  In the biggest news, crankypants Randy Johnson stayed in Arizona, literally and figuratively going nowhere.    This could either be really good or really bad for the Cubs -- I see no middle ground.  Looking at late acquisitions the Cubs made last year, they were outstanding moves that helped the Cubs go as far as they did last October, so that bodes really well.  On the other hand, Garciaparra has only played in 38 games so far this season, having missed a chunk of the season with Achilles issues.  So acquiring another player with a testy Achilles gives me a little pause.  However, the Cubs trainers do know all there is to know about Achilles now, after this season with Grudz and Prior.   In those 38 games, however, Nomar is hitting a strong .321 with 21 RBIs.  Alex was hitting .217 in 37 games with a paltry 8 RBIs, eye candy or no.  The only other unknown is that he's only ever played for the BoSox, so he might have a tough time adjusting to the NL as well as the Cubs and Wrigley.  But Wrigley's a welcoming sort of place.    This affords Dusty the pleasurable torture of finding a spot for Nomar in the batting order.  Everyone is hitting so well, for the most part, that it's just possible we won't see the same lineup two games in a row.  Nomar traditionally hits in the five hole, and there's a possibility he could fit in there quite nicely behind Alou.  But there might be some consideration to put him earlier in the lineup to get someone on base for Sammy and Mo to thunk in.  And what's funny is the same argument can be made for putting him anywhere in the lineup outside the seven spot.  Dusty's gonna have a blast figuring this out.    We'll see what combo Dusty starts with when Nomar starts tomorrow against the Phillies for the rubber match of the series.  Should be fun -- Not only is it Nomar's debut, but it's also Maddux's first shot at hitting the 300 win mark.

      John Kerry attacked Bush's campaign slogan today as "itsy bitsy" sound bites served up by politicians and political consultants, cited in Reuters' article,  urlLink Kerry Mocks Bush's 'Itsy Bitsy' Campaign Slogan .  Clearly Kerry didn't hear his own acceptance speech on Thursday, nor does he look at the failings of his own slogan.     Kerry's own slogan, "Stronger at home and respected in the world," fails in so many ways, it's hard to know where to start.  First, the very first word in the slogan addresses the fact that we are strong at home already.  He starts right off by conceding things really are pretty good in the U.S. of A.  The entire thing is so esoteric that it truly means nothing to the average voter, except that it sounds pretty.    And don't get me started about the "Hope is on the way" tagline from the Convention.  Again, they called on dispair that isn't even present in the U.S. right now, but only promise hope, not actual, tangible solutions.  At least FDR was able to fake it 'til he made it with "Happy Days Are Here Again" while trying to sell the mid-depression funk as good times.  The last few successful Democratic campaign slogans were Carter's "Not Just Peanuts" and Clinton's "Don't Stop Thinking about Tomorrow" and "Putting People First."  Now, there's too much fun to have with these right now -- I have dinner in the oven -- But you all feel free.    So now I'm looking forward to the "I'm rubber, you're glue" theme of the debates to come coupled with the positive spin that was guaranteed by the Dems at the convention for the remainder of the campaign to collide in someone coming back at some point in late October by saying, "Oh, yeah?  Your momma wears combat boots!"  Political debate at its finest.

      Kerry's acceptance speech tonight was nothing different in substance than anyone who's followed his campaign trail would have expected: Flip-flops, vague promises, and accusations.  It sounded a lot like the speeches of Junior High Student Council candidates.     First, he started right off by talking about the values of family, faith, and country.  However, this is a practicing Roman Catholic who is pro-abortion.  I'm not saying he doesn't have the right stance on this -- Those who've read me before know I'm pro-choice.  But don't talk about faith and practice your chosen religion while you live outside it.    Then he started in the "I will get a TV in the cafeteria and more recess time" segment of the show with his intentionally vague "promise" to "Restore trust and credibility to the White House."  How, pray tell, does one accomplish that?  Just by being you?  In reality, it takes examples of trust and credibility to rally the trust of others, and Kerry's track record shows him a politician of the nth degree.  The leaders of the world understand our political structure, they know from whence one comes into the White House.  His mere change of address form will not restore trust.    And that's not even calling into question the assumption that the White House is not trusted around the world.  No one ever said they didn't trust the U.S.  They said they didn't want to go to war over piddly little things like U.N. resolutions being circumvented or all out ignored.    One of my favorites was how he spoke of being able to turn the U.S. in a different direction by magic.  "I will immediately reform the intelligence system," among other comments (tax changes, health care, etc.).  Um, last time I checked, the Legislative Branch makes the laws.  Yes, there are things that a president can pull off on his own, but on whole, the president can't do squat -- It's the representative government that actually does things.  And since they haven't been able to get comprehensive health care passed since it was proposed 60 years ago, I don't know what flavor crack he's smoking thinking he can do all this on his own.  I know I'm asking too much, but some day I'd love to hear a politician say, "I'll do this if there's a cooperative legislature, but if not, I can try to do this, that, and the other, as is the nature of partisan politics and negotiations."  A girl can always hope.    Then the flat out lies came out.  He said that the Republicans claim this is the "best economy we've ever had."  I have to say I've never heard anyone claim that.  They talk about taking a dip off a really big bubble, but I've never heard someone claiming the emperor was fully clothed.    He called the activation of the National Guard and Reserves as a "back door draft."  People who sign up for non-active service know that there is the potential to be called up.  Guardsmen and Reservists were called to service during Viet Nam while there was a REAL draft on-going as well.  It's their responsibility to serve, as needed.  I have to check with my cousin (and his brothers, a former Guardsman and a former Reservist), but from what I've heard him say, as inconvenient as it is, it's his duty and he's proud to serve.  I cannot believe Kerry would sully the service of my cousin by saying he was pressed into service unwillingly.    He threw aside all truth and peppered it with fear when he invoked the name of the Saudi Royal Family and followed closely with an accusation that our military men and women are being "held hostage" by our dependence on foreign oil.  A dependence that he said he would eliminate.  That's pretty neat.  He'd cut our oil use by half (only the foreign half) or increase our own production by 3000%.  Cool trick.  Especially seeing as most of our oil sources are in protected areas, and to start the whole show he invoked the love of the environment his mother bestowed on him.  How is he going to save the spotted owl and increase U.S. oil production?  (I know, I'm mixing causes there, but it's a good line, no?)  Then he followed that closely saying Enron got the tax break after saying Bush was "evad[ing] or equivocat[ing]" the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.  He's not avoiding a decision; he's considering a course of action.  And Enron happened under Clinton's watch and was bankrupt before tax cuts went into action.  Thanks for playing.    The biggest lie of all was wrapped up in what I think was the rudest, most manipulative moment of the night.  He used Ron Reagan's speeches and cause in his partisan rhetoric.  He started by referring to Reagan's eulogy of his father when he said his dad didn't "wear his religion on his sleeve."  Kerry took that verbatim, adding he didn't live his faith "Sunday to Sunday."  Then he had the unmitigated gall to bring up Stem Cell Research, as almost an afterthought.  You know that trick in the movies where they start at some point in time, flash back to the beginning of the story, and work back to that first scene (usually shot from a different angle) and the subsequent climax?  After restating their slogan, "Stronger at home and respected in the world," (but don't even get me started with that -- He stipulates we are strong at home already) signaling all those listening that the end was near, he then brought up the Stem Cell Research issue as an applause builder to his speech's end.  And, sin of all sins, he lied by saying there was hope for Alzheimer's.  I'm ashamed, and I hope Ron wasn't in on this little trick.  I can only guess he wasn't, else he'd have insisted Alzheimer's be removed from the list.    I was struck that he threw aside a bit of the expected Democratic line, inclusion of all races, but instead went to equality for women.  I tell ya' what.  I have earned a degree in a male-dominated field, worked in male-dominated industries my entire life, and dealt with the misogynistic Roman Catholic Church, and I do not need anyone advocating for my equality -- I demand it, and thus I earn it, on my own, by my own merit.    Now, I do have to admit, there were some good tag lines.  "I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president."  "Strength is more than tough words," wasn't bad either.  But to be honest, those are the only two I wrote down as tag lines (as opposed to the anti-Bush lines).  Not a barn-burner, this one.    And I have to say as well that I was glad to hear the little meat that Kerry put on the bone of his economic policy.  I think it's pie in the sky to say that closing corporate loopholes and fining companies that send jobs overseas will pay for universal health care, neutralize the debt, and pay for some rebates on college tuition.  It's better than his "I'll squint really hard and there will be good paying jobs" plan and I think he's on the right track to incentivize companies to keep jobs here.  But again, I think he's talking about getting pizza served in the caf three days a week when you look at the plan, what there is of it, in total.    But on to some more interesting stylistic moments (I know, but at least I started with substance, unlike Kerry himself).  There were many puzzling images, word choices, and memories that were evoked tonight.  It started for me with Vanessa Kerry saying her father, "Never wavered, faltered, and he stayed the course."  Hmmm... Why does that ring a bell?  Oh, I've got it.  Both Presidents Bush.  Sr. stayed the course and Jr. used the waiver/falter/fail troika in his speech on 20 September 2001.  Then, as Kerry took the stage, what played but Bruce Springsteen's  No Surrender .  Hmmm...  Springsteen at a political function...  Why does that sound familiar?  Um, Reagan's hijacking of  Born in the U.S.A.  in 1984, perhaps?  And the Bill Clinton School of Gesturing with the closed fist/protruding thumb up thing drove me bonkers.   He was stiff to start, then he remembered he was supposed to move.  His awfully choreographed modern dance/performance art movements were as distracting as watching his forehead to see if it moved, hoping I'd won the imaginary "weeks since Botox" pool at work.  And you'd have thought that, watching all the other speakers until tonight losing 10 pounds in water weight while they were on the stage, they'd have cranked the A/C a little.  Instead, a guy who looked stiff and expressionless to start had sweat added to the mix, and I wondered if he hadn't gotten a bad bowl of clam chowder.    Now, who wants to bet al-Zarqawi is announced as the guy we caught earlier in the week first thing tomorrow to kill the Big Mo 15% projected bump out of the convention?

      ... But not for the most obvious reason.  I want to see an Edwards-Obama ticket in 2008.  I'm serious.  This is a ticket I would vote for.  Listen up, Democrats everywhere.  I would put a Democrat in the White House were it John Edwards backed up by Barack Obama.     Edwards' speech tonight was perfect.  On message all the way.  Heartfelt.  Compelling.  Within the first few words, I knew his message tonight was values.  He talked about uniting and making the world a better place.  He never took any direct swipes at Bush, and those indirect were not simply to take swipes, but to call out a difference in approach or ideology.    Of course, there were a couple of points that stuck in my craw.  When he said of Kerry, "Your cause is his cause," Edwards wasn't lying.  Clearly over the years, no matter who you were out there, Kerry has picked up your standard, if only for that moment.  As well, I was a bit upset when they talked about education and opportunity.  I went back to college at 25 years old, a woman going into Computer Engineering, an area that historically pulls 10-15% women.  I quit my job and went back to school full time.  That was during Clinton.  And what did I get, as a single woman with no income going back to school in technology?  $500 in grants over three-and-a-half years and boatloads of loans.  The Dems might talk a good game, but in my personal experience, they fall short of really helping those who need help, but help those who shouldn't need help, which keeps from helping themselves.    In stark contrast to Edwards' beam of hope was Rev. Al Sharpton.  He not only went off script, but he also went off message.  He invoked fear, saying, "The ONLY choice we have... is to elect John Kerry."  He invoked fear again when he accused the Republicans of peeking in bedrooms.  He spoke of disparate groups -- Of slaves being owed mules, of women who are oppressed -- Yet his own rhetoric is what divides the nation.  And I think he doesn't know his history because he spoke of the U.S. moving toward independence 282 years ago, which would be 1722 if my math serves.  So, unless he was talking about Peter the Great abolishing taxes on beards, the Three Years War breaking out in New England, or Samuel Adams' birth, I think he needs to learn history, lest he risk repeating it.    Tonight, however, is my favorite night of conventions -- The moment they nominate the candidate.  "Blah blah blah from the great state of blah, home of the blah, land of blah, casts blah votes for &lt;insert name of someone who wouldn't release his delegates here&gt; and blah votes for &lt;insert name here&gt;, the next president of the United States."  It's the one moment being a delegate means something, yet over the years, it actually means nothing at all.  There is no longer any anticipation, any drama, over who will be the nominee.  There are no multiple ballots, no back room negotiations.  Heck, the last time it even was close to that was the Ford wrangling in 1980 -- Not being able to come to agreement on the terms of his vice presidency, Reagan picked Bush literally last minute as his veep.  But I don't care.  I love the pomp and circumstance behind the nomination roll call.    Now, looking forward to tomorrow and beyond.  Edwards has thrown down the gauntlet by declaring disgust with negativism.  Will Kerry stay on message tomorrow and talk about the platform and what he brings to the ticket, or will he stray and take more potshots, a la Teddy Kennedy?  Will they, in the heat of battle, decide they need to start running negative ads?  Will they stand up to those "non-political" organizations that buy airtime that's clearly for the Democrats and attacking the Republicans and tell them their hate is not welcome in their campaign?  Geez, I hope so!

      I don't know what it was about today, but I swear, everyone had a second face on.  I've noticed it more and more lately in general, but today was outstanding.  I'm a good judge of character on most occasions, though I have to admit lately I've made some rather substantive boo-boos, and today the radar was fully functional.  Either that, or people just don't care to bother hiding it any longer.    For fear that someone I'm talking about happens across this blog, I can't really go into detail.  I really wish I could.  I've just typed and erased three paragraphs because I didn't like the implications if, say, someone from work hopped on by sheer dumb luck.    But I will do is this.  I will tell you that I try my best not to represent myself as  someone I am not.  Not for any reason under the sun.  If I tell you I live and die by the Cubs, I do (and I'm not watching the game tonight because the last couple I didn't watch, they won and the last couple I watched, they lost).  If I tell you I tend right of center but honestly consider what people have to say from all sides, I'm telling you the truth.  If I say I've read or seen something, I have and would love the opportunity to discuss it with you.  If I start discourse on a subject, it's because I want to discuss it and hear your side of things.  If I tell you have have pages of notes from the first two days of the Democratic National Convention (and will continue to take them for the next two nights), I do.  If I express an opinion about something, it's because I formed it, not that I read it somewhere or heard it from some talking head.    It is I, me, myself, who you see here.  I am not lurking in a shadow.  I am not morphing for the benefit of either the comfort of another or the support of the same.  I may not really care where we have dinner, but I assure you I am not tractable.  I spent time in a relationship where I was not myself, and I have resolved never to do that again.  I am myself because it's too hard to remember whom I am supposed to be for whatever person I'm talking to at that moment.    I like a good wine, but I enjoy Dr. Pepper.  I listen to everything from Salsa to Classical to Classic Rock, you name it.  I love having nails and painting them, but I love any opportunity to break them doing something fun and tomboyish.  I can use the word "comprise" correctly in a sentence, but then choose to express myself in blue.  I'm a smart woman who does really stupid things sometimes.  But I will never tell you anything different from who I really am.    Don't get me wrong.  I don't tip my hand.  I believe in mental reservations and exercise them regularly.  I know more than most think I know, and I play games when the circumstance requires.    But I have to admit there is one place where I play as someone other than myself, more for the protection of playing there without others with whom I played online taking that forum away from me.  But, other than the name, the person, ideas, and ideals expressed there are me.  And after today, I'm wondering if that one disguise that I don from time to time, though well-intentioned, should be pushed aside so I can stand tall in my defense of me as myself, and not some facade.    Sorry.  I'm just in a mood today.    You know, I just changed my mind.  I'll give you one example.  I was accused today of adopting support of Embryonic Stem Cell Research solely because of Ron Reagan's speech last night.  That could not be further from the truth, and anyone who knows me would know where I stand.  I am a scientist by nature and love the idea of exploration of any kind.  I was raised in a Catholic parish that included a well-known right-to-lifer, and as a result I have become an advocate of those who currently walk this earth when they are weighed against those that may someday walk this earth.  I am not jumping on a bandwagon, though Reagan's speech did stir me to action.  Meanwhile, back on the ranch, let's just say there was a prime occasion today where this person said something and did something entirely in opposition to a position taken only moments earlier.    Before you tell me I'm not me, get to know me.  And if you dare to tell me who you are, you'd best be right, 'cuz I'll figure it out.

      Iran has taken the U.N. seals off centrifuges and resumed the process to produce nuclear material according to the AP in  urlLink Diplomats: Iran Resumes Nuclear Program .  Outstanding.  Not only does this happen during the DNC when nothing else is being covered, but it happens at a time when Iran is as flip-floppy as Kerry around how they want to play on the international scene.     And why would they do such a thing?  Could it be because the U.N. carries no weight in the international community after letting Iraq run amok for 13 years and they still haven't actually done anything about it?    But ask that question again: Why would they do such a thing?  Answering from the other side, because they are asking to get their asses kicked by thumbing their nose in the direction of the U.S.  Ah, but here's the rub.  What if Kerry is elected?  Iran is safe for at least another four years before the U.S. would do anything about it.  And historically they have on the order of a decade before the U.N. would start talking about maybe considering doing something.  So that's quite a smart risk to take, don't you think?  Playing the odds, they may go on long enough, unchecked, to accomplish their goal, and in the meantime supply terrorists with their mistakes for radiological devices.    Anyone else soiling their shorts?

      Now the U.S. and the world know why the Illinois Republican Party can't get anyone to run against Barack Obama.  As well, an impressive, passionate yet clear position was presented by Ron Reagan supporting embryonic stem cell research.     I have to admit, to the gasps of all, that I voted for Obama in the primary.  See, in Chicago, if you don't get a Democratic ballot for the primary, you end up simply flipping the pages of the famed butterfly ballot.  And, while often I vote for the candidate I think can be beaten by the Republicans, in this case I thought Obama had a real chance to do good, even if he is a liberal.  He gave an amazing speech, especially as a State Senator, someone not yet officially on the national stage.  He covered all the bases: introducing himself to the nation, promoting the Democratic approach to government, and supporting the soon to be nominees.  He knew that he was in no position to take on the president (yet), but he took the shots required to show the failures of the current administration in his Democratic mind.  Instead he spoke of unity, stressing the "United States of America."  I have to say one area that I can't disagree with him on is how our troops are treated, and when he asked, "Are we serving Seamus as well as he serves us?" I had to ask myself the same question.  Unfortunately, I look at that question equally from how the government takes care of the troops as well as Corporate America.  It was moving, impassioned, and very well delivered.  Great job!  Then Ron Reagan took the podium.  He's a very comfortable speaker with whom I'm familiar not only from his father's funeral services, but also from his work on Animal Planet's dog show coverage as well as MSNBC's  Hardball with Chris Matthews .  He showed a personal side without falsely invoking his father's memory, as it is thought that Alzheimer's is one of the diseases that might not be curable through stem cell therapy.  He stated a clear case for right-to-lifers who falsely believe that this is murder, especially after his speech in his interview with Tom Brokaw where he pointed out that the lifers were on a slippery slope by allowing any research, if that was truly their argument.  As well, I loved that he put the fine point on the argument by basically asking if you value cells, undifferentiated cells, over a living, breathing, sentient human being.  I do like that he closed with a plea to vote not for a candidate, but for embryonic stem cell research.  And I like that because I personally have been lobbying the White House to change their position.  My favorite Ron line tonight was talking about those opposed to research "are just grinding a political axe, and they should be ashamed of themselves."    Unfortunately, there were some downers this evening.  First, what is with that crowd?!  Teddy Kennedy, a great speaker though I don't agree with what he has to say, was at the podium and the joint couldn't keep it down to a low roar!  He, of course, whipped out the lie that Enron wouldn't have happened under the Dems, but that's because the theivery of Enron did, in fact, happen under Clinton's watch, but was not investigated and ended until Bush.  He was funny when he said he hoped Cheney could soon retire to that undisclosed secure location.  His speech from a technical perspective was quite enjoyable with that romp through history.  Too bad the conventioners weren't listening.  And that goes for Gephardt and others as well.    Dean did a good job as well.  He has a great speaking style, in my opinion, and was good about laying out the promise of the Democratic Party, if you believe in it.  He also did a little send up of himself by naming some states in his "Proud to call ourselves Democrats" riff.    I also have to admit that I tuned Teresa Heinz Kerry out after a while.  There was something about her demanding utter silence before starting, standing there in her red wool suit in Boston in the middle of the summer and delivering a monotone, measured speech.  I don't think it was the language thing -- I've seen her interviewed before.  It may have been the venue, I dunno.  But I do know that I was bored to tears after a while.  But we aren't electing first ladies.  We're electing presidents.    This, usually the slowest night of a convention, I believe had the two finest speeches, possibly of the entire convention (but I'll reserve judgment until Thursday night).

      Reuters is reporting that John Kerry says he'll extend the 9/11 Commission's charter if he's elected, in  urlLink Kerry Calls for Extension of 9/11 Commission .  What will the Commission be charged with, now that they have done all their research and given their recommendations?  Well, they'll be reporting on the progress of the implementation of those recommendations.  Are these people the press or babysitters?     Instead of making them watchdogs, do what Russert raised on  Meet the Press  this past Sunday, which is to get them heading the new consolidated intelligence organization.  These are smart people, whose services could dearly be used by the American government.  They shouldn't be extended 18 months to push paper and nip at heels that are dragging through the legislature.    Speaking of which, Kerry is charging that the Republicans and Bush himself are foot-dragging on implemented the suggestions the Commission put forth.  Chairman Kean is right that time is not on our side -- We've been safe for almost three years now, but we can't expect that to continue.  But Bush has to show that he's considering the recommendations rather than accepting all of them willy-nilly.  Some require some serious consideration as to how to implement them, not whether to implement them, and that's what Bush is considering -- The Hows.  And therein lies the rub -- What some see as inaction or indecision, others view as necessary separation of the Executive branch.  As well, there are a bunch, especially the key ones with changes in government reporting structure (i.e., the new intelligence clearinghouse) that require Congressional approval and new bills being passed into law.    I think it's great that the Senate immediately understood that their summer vacation had to wait while they moved on as much of this as they can.  And unfortunately Denny Hastert must have really been looking forward to working on his tan, but has since thought better.    So, with that said, remind me again why Kerry would want to extend the 9/11 Commission for 18 more months?  Oh, yeah, to look different from the president (and not in a way that even shows him as more presidential, in my opinion) and hopefully get the "anyone but Bush" vote.  Yeah, that's a great way to attain the presidency.

      What I wouldn't give to be in Boston right now, not in Fleet Center or at any of the scheduled events, but rather to people-watch those exercising their right to free speech outside the convention hall.  I had to chuckle while reading the  AFP  report  urlLink Cranks and jokesters take US protest to the streets .  I didn't go down to the United Center in 1996 for the DNC, but I also don't recall any protests of this nature (probably because they were afraid they'd get their asses kicked!).     Actually, it's probably because no one incentivized them to stage these wacky protests.  Seems some guy who runs an internet porn site is offering up $100,000 to the wackiest expression of free speech at the convention.  So what kind of people would come out for a little self-humiliation and one-hundred large?  Well, you have the anarchists who say both Bush and Kerry are equivalent to Hitler.  Yeah, right.  They are so serious about their message that they threatened to block the street, but threw in the towel after all of five minutes when the police showed up.  Thanks for playing.  Then there were the anti-Bush protesters, in all sorts of roles including Enron Man and Billionaires for Bush.    Wish I was there!

      Jason Giambi of the New York Yankees has been fighting an intestinal parasite for a while now, and it now looks more serious than at first blush, according to Yahoo! Sports ( urlLink Ailing Giambi to get test results Tuesday .  New York has such a strong history, made up of many strong men who were weakened by illness.     The one that comes immediately to mind is Lou Gehrig, "The luckiest man on the face of the Earth."  Many believe he played in the Bigs for years with the beginnings of ALS, a disease that would come to take on his name, before his disease-ravaged body could no longer take the field each day.   In the same era, Babe Ruth died of throat cancer at 53 years of age.  Roger Maris died young as well.  He was 51 when he died of lymphoma.  Thurman Munson died in a plane crash at 32 years old as captain of the Yankees squad.  He was a great catcher, doing what catchers do at that point in their careers: Starting to get out from behind the plate to First and the Outfield in the hopes that the knees and hips might last another year.      Billy Martin, the on-again/off-again skipper of the Yanks died in a tragic car accident on Christmas Day at 61.  One can only imagine how many more times Steinbrenner could have hired/fired him.    Mickey Mantle died in his early 60s as well.  And Catfish Hunter died from, of all things, Lou Gehrig's Disease at the age of 53, only after playing in the Major Leagues with diabetes for so many years while dominating hitters (with the exception of a fellow diabetic, Ron Santo).  So many strong men dying earlier than many others, but having lived full lives.    There's Joe Torre who fought and beat cancer, as did the current pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre, and former players Mike Lowell, Ed Hearn, and Darryl Strawberry.  Count in Rudy Giuliani, and the Yankees of recent history have had their share of illness.    Love em' or hate 'em, the Yankees have been through seemingly more than their share of sadness over the years.  I'm pulling for Jason and hoping he joins this list as conqueror, rather than as one of those Yankees conquered by disease.

      Hillary gave a great introduction of her husband: "Please welcome the 42nd President of the United States, Bill Clinton."  Which, of course, came at the end of the nearly ten minute long speech in which she hit every plank in the platform on her way to the nomination (at some point in the future) and touted Kerry and Edwards.  Anyone get the impression that the Clintons think Kerry's best quality is that he's serious?  "Serious man for a serious job."  Serious this and serious that.  But wait, there's more...     There was Bill's informercial-esque delivery of 22 minutes of Bush bashing, culminating in 3 minutes of pro-candidate speech.  The best thing Clinton could say of Kerry was that he could drive a boat 30 years ago.  He hid that by calling out the party line against the Bush administration's choices over the past three-and-a-half years.  I wasn't sure if he was selling knives (or that stuff from Ron Popeil that Gore used to cover his bald spot) or he was promoting fake perfume.  "If you think that's good, then reelect the Reps.  If not, vote for Kerry/Edwards."  "If you like Obsession, you'll love Psychosmell."  (Man, do I wish I could remember the faux parfum names!)   It was a classic Clinton speech -- Many tag lines, some good humor, direct when he wanted to be and flirtatious otherwise, and long.  Though not as long as it might have been or could be -- He knew he was running into the late local news, not another speaker, so he had to get off on time.    He did have quite a few highly-quotable lines.  You "Can't kill, jail, or occupy all our enemies."  And, "How can we enforce trade policies against our bankers?"  (You tell me, Bill, because you never enforced the same policies regardless of any national debt.)  I have to admit I quite liked, "Strength and wisdom are not opposing values."  That one was quite good -- Was he intimating that Bush shows only bravado and not strength and wisdom?  And he even admitted he benefited from the tax cut, unlike most of the Democratic constituency, as well as saying he could have gone to Viet Nam as could have Bush, while pointing out that Kerry actually did.    I know I'm sounding even more partisan than usual, but the bs lines about cutting out the rhetoric only to be subjected to these speeches tonight (save Carter's, kinda) just drives me bonkers!  Heck, Clinton even started by saying they weren't mounting a negative campaign, that the positive campaign would focus on "not who is a bad or good person," but instead, he went right after them like a little terrier.  He also railed on the Reps, then said, "They need a divided America... But we don't," though clearly that isn't the prevailing opinion, lest they not incite the Dems against the Reps instead of in support of the platform.  As usual, Clinton was speaking out of both sides of his mouth.    Reps...  Please...  Listen to me!  Don't pull the same crap -- Rise above it!  As Nixon told Pat, "Buchanan, you never shoot  down  in politics."

      Can I get an amen?!  Geez oh man, was that as Southern Baptist as one can get without a cross hanging behind the pulpit?!  So much for toning down the anti-Bush rhetoric.  While Gore didn't speak of Bush by name (did he even utter it?  I can't recall), it took all of moments to get to Bush bashing.  The most pointed were those that spoke of Bush "burning the bridges" to our allies and that "this president is incapable of admitting a mistake."  A kinder, gentler DNC...  In the spirit of the campaign thus far (from either side).     My favorite part of Gore's speech was his insistence that every vote counts.  Um, no, every vote does not count.  My vote, cast religiously as is my duty as an American, does not count in a presidential election.  Illinois' electoral votes have not truly counted since, what, 1960 when Illinois went to Kennedy, prompting Nixon's concession speech?  Yeah, Illinois went for Reagan in 1984, but only Minnesota didn't (oh, and D.C. -- Who could forget that?!).  Voting Republican in every presidential election since my first in 1988, only that first vote counted.  That was the last time Illinois went Republican, and since then it hasn't even been close.    No true American should decide not to vote, left, right, or center, based on their vote allegedly not counting, so quit beating that dead horse!  Unless and until the Electoral College goes by the wayside, this is the system and we have to work inside it.  The issue in 2000 was not that the Dems didn't turn out -- It's that they didn't turn out in the right states (or they did, actually, perhaps).  And, as Chris Matthews and Ron Reagan pointed out on coverage tonight on MSNBC, had Gore asked for a full recount instead of trying to steal the election himself by only recounting certain counties, he might have been at the podium Wednesday night instead of tonight.    And don't get me started about the Electoral College.  It made sense when the lack of technology made instantaneous election impossible, but now it's simply a numbers game used to manage monies spent and encourage visits to small towns that might otherwise think their votes don't count.  A dichotomy, certainly, as they wouldn't be a stop on the campaign trail, but their votes would ultimately count down to the individual instead of collectively, making it far more inclusive a process.  But I digress...  One thing I was hoping for, but missed: Gore's recently trademarked low grumbling growl.      9:00pm  -- Shoot!  I forgot...  Did anyone else notice that Gore slipped?  He all but asked the audience what the world would have been like on 9/11 had Nader been in the White House when lobbying those who might vote for him again, then when he spoke of his and Clinton's efforts, he said they fought against "eco-terrorism" then corrected it to "narco-terrorism" immediately.  Very interesting...  Sometimes a cigar is just a...  Sorry, that was his boss.

      I briefly heard this story the other day, and read about it in detail in an AP report on MSNBC.com,  urlLink Murderer father agrees to son's request for ‘divorce’ .  Seems this guy killed his wife and left his eight-year-old son to find her, shot eight times lying in a pool of blood in their bedroom, and the son has had to fight to get this murderer out of his life.     Seems the child was left in the custody of the grandparents, then ultimately the victim's best friend, and that arrangement was fine over the course of the past six years, until the father started requesting information on him from prison, such as his school records.    This 14-year-old is dealing with things that adults are not equipped to handle.  He is in the center of a wrongful death suit and settlement, his father is appealing the verdict, and he is having to deal with the man who murdered his mother inserting himself into his life as he tries to move forward.  And the person who put and is putting this child through all this is not some stranger -- It's his own father.    It's another one of those instances that simply makes me want to cry.  This child has been through enough and his father, a man that brought him into this world, doesn't have the common decency to know that he's done enough damage, take his punishment, and leave the child alone.  Meanwhile, he's holding this child's future in limbo, financial and psychological -- For that alone he should be brought up on capital charges!  Instead he sits in a cell for the rest of his life without parole, haunting this child.  It's just wrong.    Hopefully the relinquishing of rights will help the child move on and make something click in that sick man's brain that he needs to move on.  Thank goodness for the true parents who have taken this child into their home and care for him when his mother no longer can and father no longer cares to.

      I was just perusing the  urlLink DNC Schedule  posted on MSNBC.com and I've started thinking about some rather interesting choices of speakers as well as the timing of those speeches.  Not only is the requisite time being allotted to the past Democratic Party figures, but it seems as though there are some glaring parallels with the Bush administration's current cabinet and some flat out pandering that can't help but be called out.     The pandering starts with a relatively unknown representative from Ohio talking about jobs.  Well, no duh.  Get the Ohio vote to come to you by talking specifics to them by someone who actually is supposed to represent them in government.  It makes perfect sense.  Unfortunately, this has no opportunity to be anything more than talking in generalities and bringing to the fore the alleged Bush administration failures in the job arena as she happens to focus on welfare programs -- In fact, she's most qualified, it would seem, to talk about health care and health issues.    However, they chose someone else -- a Wisconsinite -- to talk about health care reform.  Hold on a second... This rings a bell...  Oh, yeah.  The current HHS head is Tommy Thompson from Wisconsin.  Who wants to bet that there is nothing new presented here, and likely along the lines of what Tommy himself put in place as governor of Wisconsin?  Then the parade of backslappers starts.    But before that begins, you have the parade of ex's -- Ex-presidents and ex-would-have-been-president -- tonight.  This is quite an interesting pick, in my opinion, picking Al Gore as a speaker.  While his fire-and-brimstone style of late will serve to counter the laid-back style of Carter and long-winded style of Clinton (what's the over/under on the length of his speech, anyway?), his appearance can only serve to remind the Dems of their failure in 2000 (or incite memories of the "stolen" election, depending on your perspective).    I have read nearly everywhere that the Dems are being very careful to keep the mood of the convention upbeat and keep attacks on Bush for only the necessary moments.  Clearly that is their intent by the schedule of events.  Days -- Literally days -- are being spent on pumping up Kerry's image, especially in the international arena.  Glaringly missing from the roster of sycophants is anyone with any international reach.  Not that one would expect a foreign leader to speak on Kerry's behalf, but there is no one with any broader reach than participation in the Armed Services or government experience (with the exception of Bill Richardson, current New Mexico governor, who was an ambassador and energy head for Clinton).  The lineup seems to me to be as weak as Kerry's policies.  Let's see what actually shakes out during the next four days.

      I have to start by admitting that I haven't quite finished it off -- I've skimmed key areas and have read in detail the first chapter as well as the two "next steps" chapters.  While the coverage and analysis by the news organizations is right on, I still think the report is something that every American should read for themselves.     There are a few things already that are new to me, and I'd followed this story as closely as any story I've been around for before or since.  One that really caught me was the timing of the president's appearance with the schoolkids and his hearing of the attacks.  I didn't know that he was notified of the WTC being hit (though it was first thought to be a private pilot and accidental)  before  his going out to speak to the kids.  I have always supported his decision to remain calm and complete his appearance after hearing of the second plane into the WTC so as not to frighten the kids, but I now think (as a Monday morning QB does) that perhaps he could have held for a couple of minutes before going out into that room to get the facts.  Even if it wasn't believed to be an attack at first blush, it's still a potential tragedy with casualties in the symbols of American trade.    One thing that hit me as well was what I had known in the earliest moments of that day nearly three years ago -- That the world had changed dramatically.  I wrote in a journal for a negotiations class I was taking at the time, after having said the same to people during the course of that day, that until that moment, being hijacked was not the worst thing that could have happened to you.  Statistically, you weren't likely to die, and worst case, you end up in Cuba for a couple of days, shucks golly gee darn.  As well, the military was still facing a consolidated Russian threat instead of a disparate fundamentalist threat.  One of the CAPS pilots from that day said they saw the Pentagon and thought "cruise missile" not suicide hijacking.  Never was it expected that al-Qaeda could pull off something of a magnitude of a military attack on the U.S., and for that gross misunderstanding of the real threat and underestimation of their organization, we paid with over 3,000 lives.    And that lack of understanding of the terrorist threat to the U.S. Homeland glares even after the events of 9/11.  I saw Bush's speech on the 20th (I was at a dinner party, of all things, for work at a partner's house and we insisted on eating in front of the TV to see the address), and I remember commenting that initiating a "War on Terrorism" and a zero-tolerance policy was inane.  There's no way they'd talk about going after the Real IRA like they'd go after al-Qaeda, so why speak in such broad tones?  As well, who in Israel are the terrorists?  One could argue that the Israeli government is as terroristic as any organized Palestinian group.  So a lack of complete understanding of the extent of the terrorist problem and the portions that apply to the U.S., I would argue, are still hindering our efforts worldwide.  But the committee's recommendations to focus the scope of the war on terrorism will hopefully better concentrate our efforts, and the efforts of our allies, on areas where we can impact those intent on killing innocent Americans.    All told, it is as non-partisan as reported, a report of which I was skeptical at first because I'd heard it from the more liberal media outlets.  In line with my cynical nature, however, I read some of it as being equal opportunity to both parties and both the Clinton and Bush administrations to cover their respective asses.  I have to admit that it is done very well within the report, however, and not heavy-handed at all.    From a technical perspective, breaking off that last point, it is a very well-written report.  It is well-organized and very readable, unlike other reports I've read, and is supported with copious footnotes, illustrating the depth and breadth of their research (and trying desperately to avoid the Warren trap by showing its comprehensive coverage).  The one thing it's lacking, in my opinion, is a detailed timeline.  The stories of each aircraft and agency/organization is told, but I found myself flipping back and forth to try to maintain a timeline in my head.  I also think that great care was taken in presenting the individual impact to the events of 9/11 wherever possible.  People are mentioned by name where appropriate (and if not in the text, are notated in detail), and there's a whole section devoted to heroic efforts made in the Towers that day.    And that is why I think every American should read this report for themselves.  We each need to remember that the landscape has changed and that we are now direct targets of terrorism every waking moment.  There are numerous moments during the 9/11 timeline where the acts of individuals changed (or should have changed) the outcome of that day for countless others.  We need to move forward with our lives understanding that we stand on the front line of the war on terror and that we can prevent further tragedies as well or even better than the governmental agencies responsible for our security.     26 July 2004 -- Ask and you shall receive.

      Those are the only three reasons I can think of for why only about half of the available tickets to Olympic events are yet unsold.  According to an AP story on Yahoo! Sports,  urlLink More than half of Olympic tickets unsold , Greek tourism in general is being hit as well as the Olympics.     I have a hard time buying that there is waning interest in the ultimate in amateur sports competition.  Look at swimming and the potential for some outstanding showings by Americans, and a great competition in general, you can't help but get excited.  Gymnastics should be very competitive this year again, on both the women's and mens's sides.  And there is potential for a great head-to-head competition in women's pole vault between the U.S. phenom Stacy Dragila, who was that close in the trials to breaking the 5m mark, and Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva, who just set a new world record.    While NBC's coverage historically is outstanding, the addition of the Vivendi channels into the mix will provide all the coverage you could ever want.  But I still think people know when they have the opportunity to see history, they actually go and see it in person.  Looking at the turnout for the Salt Lake Winter Olympics, there was great fear in that it was just after 9/11, but people still turned out in droves to thumb their noses at terrorism as well as witness a great event.    Speaking of fear, I found it interesting to see Athens awarded the games.  I know you have to do it regularly, being the birthplace of the Olympics, but it has been a relatively unsafe country for quite a while now (for Europe, anyway).  There's a history of terrorism around separatist movements (Montenegro, if I recall), and there's the inherent issue of an historic city being able to accomodate thousands of additional people.  Then, add in all the rumblings around construction not coming off on time, and I have to believe that either the fear of terrorism or the fear of arrival in Athens only to find that the games have been moved to, I dunno, Bangalore (you know, where all the jobs are moving to as well) would keep people from attending.    I strongly hope the next three weeks prove to allay fears and that these Olympics are a great success in every sense.

      Friday night, I was at an historic event; one that is historic for several reasons.  It was a benefit for my cousin, a Chicago Fireman, who has a brain tumor and the correspondingly growing bills to boot (pun intended).  His brother, on the Chicago Police Department, threw the event, getting it hosted at the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge hall.  So, not only was it historic in that a bunch of firemen were allowed in the FOP hall, but also that they actually hung out with policemen all night long.  But seriously, the top reason I call this an historic event is because I've never before seen so many true heroes, who would be averse to such a label, in one place at once.     My other cousin, their older brother, is in from Kuwait, so he was in attendance.  Among all the raffle prizes, generously donated by many local businesses and concerned citizens, were two flags that my cousin and his crew flew in Baghdad and have documented for presentation.  The only person that got louder applause than when Eddie's service, return home, and donations were announced was the guest of honor himself.  I would have loved to have won such an honored prize, representative of the sacrifices of thousands.    I cannot begin to estimate how many people showed up.  There were on-duty police who showed up to pay their cover, grab a slice of pizza, and fork over more money to buy handfuls of raffle tickets, for which they wouldn't even be present, therefore having no chance to win.  And for one lucky sergeant who was there for the drawing, I'm sure he'll cherish his CFD cap and t-shirts!  That was the funniest scene of the night -- White-shirted policeman wearing a black cap with the red CFD logo on it.    There was a PR firetruck -- One retrofitted with seats where the ladders and hoses used to be on which policemen rode (past the 911 Center, which happened to still be down after a power outage).  All stood and clapped along with the CPD Pipe and Drum Corps.  The guys from his company designed and were selling t-shirts with a brain with a spot on it and a cartoon of Brian when his eye was swollen (not one of his most attractive moments).  It's a classic move -- What doesn't kill you has to be laughed at, and heartily!  Wholly 75% of the people there put their lives on the line each and every day to keep me safe and some day may have to save me from harm.  In an extension of that selflessness in their professions, they were most generous in their support, emotionally and financially, of their fellow hero.  I am grateful for all their sacrifices on my behalf and that of my family.

      In an interesting turn of events, Reuters is reporting in their story,  urlLink FBI Probes Report Group Planning Convention Attack , that a domestic group plans to attack not the conventions themselves, but rather the media vehicles covering the convention.  Ingenious, but quite frightening.     I remember watching the World Series in 1989, was it, with the A's and Padres when the earthquake hit San Fran.  When the TV feed went dead, all I could think of were the wonderful catastrophe movies of the '70s and '80s, especially  Black Sunday , the one where the Super Bowl was attacked by a blimp.  Even in that moment, far before terrorism really hit U.S. soil, I thought the worst when that happened.  It turned out to be bad -- a 6.9 on the Richter scale -- just not sinister.   I can only imagine what the impact would be if the feeds from the conventions suddenly and inexplicably cut off.  Fortunately, in today's cellular era, someone from the inside would hop on the phone and report in that they were OK, but it would still make for some very tense moments across America and the world.    While they talk about the unprecedented security for the conventions themselves, here's hoping they are considering wide areas around and services to the facilities.

      And, as expected, it's from the foreign press.  AP in Europe is reporting that  urlLink Documents Show Kissinger Liked Nixon .  Oh the horror!   According to new documents released by the British government, Kissinger is said to have warmed to Nixon over the years, ultimately seeing him as "basically warm hearted."  It makes for an interesting discussion when one pits that against the image built on the tapes made in the White House.  In the most striking moments from those tapes, Nixon tends to come off like a ruthless, paranoid egotist.  It's tough to believe that someone like Kissinger, who had once thought Nixon epitomized the worst of politics, could say in the midst of all that that the guy was really a sweetie.    As well as presenting a different image of the late president, these documents reveal that Kissinger had some serious disdain for those around the president.  He makes a comparison with those in the Kennedy White House, saying those under JFK were "idealists" while those with Nixon were "real heels."  I think anyone who's seen the Watergate proceedings might easily agree with that assessment, with only a few targeted exceptions.    This is reported second hand -- Not from a letter Kissinger wrote, but rather from a letter someone who spoke with Kissinger wrote.  I can't wait to see if Kissinger comes out and addresses this release.  I'd love to hear if that was said just to make it look like there was a united front with the president, but distancing himself from others in the administration, or if it's truly representative of how he felt at the time.  Most of all, I'd love to find out if he continued to hold whatever opinion he had of Nixon through Watergate itself.

      You'll have to wait until I read it.  I plan on picking it up tomorrow and reading it over the weekend.  It'll take its place on my bookshelf next to the Warren Commission Report and the gap where my annotated copy of the Tower Commission Report used to be (I can't believe I lost track of it!).  As with many things, I hold judgement until I have seen as much as I can myself.

      Maddux pitched his second consecutive complete game in a 13-2 romp of the Reds.  It's nice to see the offense come alive, but I certainly wish those extra 10 runs had been spread over the past few games.     Some might be ready to concede the Central and start talking wild card; I'm not.  I think we still have a shot at it.  Anything can happen in the next two plus months.  We still have to get healthy, and if Zambrano keeps plunking the opponents we might be looking at some beat up ballclubs (just kidding, but you knew that!).    As usual, we need some help.  We need St. Louis to skid, allowing the misused law of averages to be invoked.  Regardless of what happens elsewhere, the Cubs need to win.  Period.  No more close games, lost in late innings.  No more running ourselves out of games.  No more men stranded on third with one or no outs.  No more Little League baserunning mistakes.    And in its purest form and in the immortal words of Harry Caray, "Let's get some runs!"

      So, in the face of the investigation of Sandy Berger, Dems are accusing the Reps of pulling this out of their hat to deflect the 9/11 report coming out tomorrow (which was leaked in nearly full detail earlier in the week).  This doesn't ring true to me for one main reason.     The way I see it, the non-partisan 9/11 Commission Report makes, according to the leaks, no accusation as to whether it was preventable and which presidency could have best prevented it had it been preventable.  If there is really nothing accusatory in the report, other than pointing at agencies across administrations, why would the Reps feel the need to bring this investigation to the fore?  Not that this Republican administration hasn't made some serious misjudgements on treating controversy.  They are now famous for allowing mole hills to build into mountains while they decry they are simply little bumps.  Then, when the mountain casts a shadow so wide not even a blind man could ignore it, they come out and acknowledge that it's a bit of a hill.  In that context, I guess it wouldn't surprise me if they thought they needed to get out in front of this report, even though any non-paranoid strategist would advise to let it lie.    But why, then, would you leak the story days in advance of the report that you're looking to take attention off of?  It would be like a magician saying "Abracadabra" as he takes the stage, then uttering nothing when he pulls the rabbit out of his hat.  Were the Reps actually looking to take the heat off the commission's report, it would have served to leak the story today or even late tonight/early tomorrow and let it all come out overnight.    Now, when Bin Laden is "captured" during the acceptance speech at the DNC, well then there might be a case for attention grabbing.

      Take former National Security Adviser Sandy Berger.  AP is reporting in the story  urlLink AP: Clinton Adviser Probed in Terror Memos  that Sandy walked out of the National Archive with various documents from his time in the Clinton administration that he was allegedly brushing up on before the 9/11 Hearings.     After having his house searched earlier this year, Berger returned some documents to the FBI, but there are still several notable documents missing.  The most sensitive of these are the post-game of the Millennium threats.     Now, here's the hallmark of an outstanding National Security Adviser.  He didn't sneak in a "coffee" with acetone in it to eat up the ink.  He didn't come in with any sort of covert plan.  He simply stuffed the papers in his jacket, briefcase, and, um, pants.  Yes, ladies and gentleman, his pants.    But, on the other hand, here's someone from the Parsing White House at his finest.  In his statement, released via his lawyer,   "I deeply regret the sloppiness involved, but I had no intention of withholding documents from the commission, and to the contrary, to my knowledge, every document requested by the commission from the Clinton administration was produced."  Outstanding.  Of course he could say that -- They weren't asking him for the documents, so he wouldn't know if they didn't get to see any that he had secreted out of the Archive.  But best of all is that he regrets his sloppiness, clearly at how it came to pass that he was caught.    Now the question becomes, "What, exactly, was so important that he risk prosecution and public humiliation to merit violating the law?"

      In a somewhat surprising move, the new Iraqi PM has allowed radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr to resume publishing his newspaper, according to  The Washington Post  in  urlLink Iraq Says Sadr Can Resume Publishing .  This is the brightest show of democracy a government can make: Allowing dissenting opinions to be published.  Provided, of course, that they are not directly inciteful of illegal behavior.     This is exactly what I was talking about in my post about Iran.  Iraq could have come up with some very solid excuses as to why al-Sadr would not be allowed to publish his anti-American and anti-Iraqi sentiments.  But they didn't.  Instead, they are allowing the newspaper to go back to publishing whatever it is that they want to say.  As well, it nicely contrasts any thought that the new government is a puppet of the U.S.  There would be a big risk of it appearing that way if the only news out of Iraq today was that of the attack on Fallujah, but that was even spun to show Iraq had control of Iraq in that they approved the raid after the U.S. asked permission.    Hopefully this will go over well on the Arab Street, but more importantly I hope it goes to show all of Iraq that all Iraqis will be included in the government going forward and that every group has a voice.  A legal voice, however.

      Maddux had outstanding control in today's 5-0 win over the Brew Crew, allowing only five hits in the complete game shutout.  That was the veteran's first shutout in three years and exactly one year since his last complete game.  And on a day when the wind was blowing in with some vigor, three different Cubs went yard.  Including base-running errors, these guys looked like the Cubs for the first time in weeks.     There's more encouraging news.  The organization says Aramis will be back at third any day now (but we've heard that before).  As well, Prior's elbow MRI shows no tendon damage and he had a great workout today; they say he might not miss his start on Monday.  And an up-and-coming pitcher, Todd Wellemeyer, came off the DL after   But, there were some troubling points in today's game.  Other than the three long balls, there wasn't a lot of offense, with only eight hits and two runners left in scoring position.  And Todd Walker almost made that three when he failed to advance to third on Sammy's infield roller.  Fortunately, a wild pitch helped out.    Here's hoping this is the start of something good -- That they have their legs back under them and will go out and take tomorrow's from Milwaukee and the next two from St. Louis, the last time we see them this season.  That would, with a little help from Cinci, put us three games behind the Cards in the NL-Central, easily within striking distance if we can keep our act together.

      Because I sure have.  National news tonight talked about the leaks ahead of the 9/11 Commission's report, which included that 11 of the 19 hijackers came through Iran.  Again, however, the report is said to deny that Iran had any knowledge of the forthcoming attack or direct involvement in the operation.  Now there's news that Iran has arrested a number of alleged al-Qaeda supporters, according to a Reuters report entitled  urlLink Iran Arrests Iranian Al Qaeda Backers - State TV .  On the other hand, a certain noise has subsided some, namely that around the Iranian nuclear program.     Does this mean that there is some Qaddafi-like movement of the Iranian government, that fearing retribution from the United States they are suddenly playing ball?  Or is it more like Saddam who did only what he had to do to keep the U.N., et al, at bay by appeasing them in trickles?    But in the same moment, more news out of Iran shows there is palpable fear that the government feels it is at risk as they close down two pro-reform newspapers, according to  AFP .  This is the same government that prohibited many if not all moderate candidates from running in the most recent elections to preserve the conservative stranglehold on the government.    Iran is the true test of whether the U.S. approach to the Middle East is working.  Would that there's democratic success of some measure in Iraq, Iran might be the next to fall.  And it sounds as though the Iranian government knows exactly where they are positioned on the board.    The next few months in the Middle East all told will likely spell the fate of Iran's current government.  If Palestine can dump Arafat (or he dies, for which Israel is planning) and actually get some good work toward peace accomplished, if Iraq's new government hits some high points in accomplishing the work of an independent government, and if elections in Iraq go off as unhitched as possible, Iran may be in for some turbulent times.

      Maurice Greene, the U.S. sprinter, has declared himself the Greatest of All Time and has a tattoo incorporating that acronym in the mane of a lion.  But this Goat can't even get up for the 200m in the Olympic Trials.  How can you call yourself the greatest of all time when you couldn't be bothered to run in all your events?     Ahh, but he'll race in the Super Grand Prix just two weeks before the Olympics, "hoping to gain a psychological edge on them with a victory" in London, quoting  AFP's  story  urlLink Greene set to face Collins July 30 in London .  Grandstanding and risking his Olympic career... Nice.    He has the unmitigated gall to put himself ahead of the likes of Carl Lewis who has, what, 7 gold medals across multiple olympics and events.  Unless and until you prove yourself, don't go around talking smack.  I never saw Jesse Owens run, but I have to believe he's spinning in his grave to hear the kinds of things Greene is saying.    In a Greek paper,  urlLink Greene qualifies with style , Greene makes the following embarassing statement:  “It takes an athlete like me to come along and surpass them. They had their time. This is my time,” said Greene, who admitted that someone from a new generation of speedsters would someday overtake him. “Until then, [I’m] the Greatest of All Time,” Greene said.   He also says the only way the U.S. isn't going to win the 4x100m relay is if they drop the baton.  Well, buddy, you wave to the crowd, pump your fist in the air, and pat yourself on the back like that and you could well lose feeling in your hands!  It is so sad that sportsmanship, especially in an event like the Olympics, has gone the way of the dodo.

      And I was hoping they'd start the second half of the season out with a strong showing.  While we did pull out a win yesterday, seeing Mark go down in the second was heartbreaking.     Not only was this heartbreaking as a fan of the Cubs, but also as a fan of Prior.  He battles through so much and is such a nice guy, it's tough to see him have setback after setback.  At the start of the game, I could tell something was wrong.  Mark couldn't hit his spots and just didn't look comfortable on the mound.  Then he called "No mas."    So, what does this mean for the Cubs?  I think it will only make it a little more diffficult to pull out the division this season, but not impossible.  We have a solid pitching staff, with Remlinger back and Rusch filling in like a champ.  And who knows what they'll find in Mark's MRI.  He's been battling this across seasons, by his account, so if they don't find anything, he could be back in two weeks after some rest.  But we can ill afford any other injuries at this point.  Can we just one game this year have all our starters from before Spring Training available?!

      Martha Stewart was sentenced today to five months in prison, five months home confinement, and a $30,000 fine as reported in MSNBC's story  urlLink Stewart receives 5-month prison term .  That fine is the part that gets me.     Martha made $51,000 on the trade, or more appropriately saved losing $51,000 on the tip.  But her fine only totaled $30,000.  That's silly.  As a deterrent, there should have at least been a levy of a multiple of her gains.    To add insult to injury, her MSO stock went up by 20% on the news that she received the minimum sentence, which was stayed pending appeal.  Not knowing what she holds in her own company, I can only guess that the bump today covered her $30,000 loss.    I can't wait for her to go to jail over this greed that amounted to significantly less than 1% of her daily earnings any average year.  This is greed at its finest.  I would have, however, liked to have seen a more serious penalty, at the very least equal to those funds gained by her illegal activity.    Now to see what Bacanovic gets this afternoon.

      In a move that would have been thought asinine ten years ago, Illinois has passed a law allowing HIV-positive persons to donate their organs to others with the same affliction;  urlLink Illinois to Allow HIV Organ Transplants .  Being infected with HIV is no longer an immediate death sentence.  Is this paradigm shift responsible for the increase in HIV infection rates?       I have to wonder if there isn't a more casual approach to AIDS infection as a result of high-profile infectees like Magic Johnson and others.  As you are seeing fewer and fewer people die from AIDS, it's less and less a scary proposition.    With that said, however, I'm glad that the system is no longer ignoring the needs of those infected with HIV.  If the receipt of an organ will not compromise the overall health of an infected patient, there's no reason in my mind why they shouldn't be awarded it, especially if that organ is viable, but only to someone infected with HIV.    I know the topic of surgery on HIV patients is a tough one for most medical staff.  The risk of infection of a health worker during surgery is nominal, but not nil.  My deepest hope is that there are enough transplant specialists out there who are willing to perform these tough surgeries.

      The image that pops to mind is that of Homer Simpson walking out of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant with a radioactive rod stuck to his shirt, but this isn't nearly as funny.  Along with a now-recovered set of keys to secure areas of Los Alamos National Laboratory, two data disks have gone missing, and it's enough to shut the joint down:  urlLink U.S. Nuclear Lab Temporarily Halts Secret Work .     No, we aren't under the same nuclear cloud we were during the Cold War, but today's consequences seem more dire to me.  Many of our current threats pose no immediate danger to us by having information -- al-Qaeda want nuclear materials, not tapes.  But there are rogue nations such as North Korea and Iran who might find some way to employ any lessons learned from data snuck out of Los Alamos.    And remember, this is the same facility from which Dr. Lee stole secrets, though later reduced to downloading secure materials onto a non-secure machine when they couldn't build a case against him.  To this day, we don't know if anyone really knows with whom Lee may have been in contact.  This could well prove to bite us in the buttocks.    I've known many scientists and engineers; as a matter of full disclosure, I am an engineer.  Many of those science-types I wouldn't trust to make it across the street.  They live in a very protected world, so often times they lose sight of the world around them and the dangers in it.  And I'd guess that, with the removal of our primary nuclear threat from the playing board, their guards may have been even more relaxed in the past decade or so.  Here's hoping this is just a case of a mad scientist bringing home a copy of Warcraft he plopped onto a Zip disk that was just sitting around.

      And this is why you don't want to let a fledgling government actually rule things.  They announced -- Actually announced -- the formation of a group that will try to infiltrate insurgent efforts to preempt strikes.  Seems to me like you might want to keep this under your hat for a bit, unless...   ... You're trying fake them out.  Make them paranoid, thinking everyone involved in the plans is a spy.  Somehow, I don't think that's the case.  Which means that these groups will likely close themselves off to new people joining.  I guess I just don't understand the motivation behind announcing a group with such a target.    Not that it isn't a good idea for the new Iraqi government to try to stop the insurgency.  11 killed yesterday and 10 more today.  I think we're all hoping that these Islamic groups will see that they are attacking Muslims and finally stop the carnage.

      First the Philippines, now Saudi Arabia.  Each has hostages in the hands of al-Qaeda; each has bowed to the pressure and are pulling out, to differing extents, of Iraq.  While the Saudi incident involves a private firm pulling out to save an Egyptian and the Philippines are pulling out their whopping force of less than 50 people all of a month early, the simple fact that each has caved to terrorist demands puts everyone in Iraq, and around the world, at increased risk.     These terrorists clearly do not understand the complexion of foreigners in Iraq because most of the hostages they are taking are from smaller countries with few or no forces in Iraq.  As well, they are not interested in the independence of Iraq -- If they were, they wouldn't be demanding the ouster those who are rebuilding Iraq.  And their repeated attacks on the oil pipeline, Iraq's only way to generate revenue, highlight the terrorists' indifference to the plight of the Iraqi people.    Yet countries and companies are bowing to their demands to gain the release of two individuals while at the very same moment putting everyone around the world at risk.  Two individuals.  Back in the '80s, hijacking became passe because no one ever had their demands met.  If there's no return on the investment, why take the risk?  Now, there is a regular ROI, even in this risky market of dealing in people's lives.  These terrorists will continue to affect these kidnappings, beheading those from countries that won't play ball, as long as there's a potential for a payoff of some kind.  As well, there's a higher risk that these kidnappings will once again, as they have for decades, reach into other lands.  Next thing we'll hear about an American being nabbed from Tel Aviv or a Frenchman being snagged in Morocco (in which case France will surrender on the E.U.'s behalf).  But remember, this is in addition to the countless people we rarely now hear about being taken hostage in places like Colombia and Indonesia.    Attacks on people in Iraq and elsewhere will not cease unless and until they no longer bring about victories, regardless how small, for the terrorists.  These are battles on which the war hinges, not insignificant battles that those with representatives in Iraq think we can afford to lose.  We cannot lose these battles and expect to win the war on terror.

      Today was their last stand...  And they did about as well as Custer.  Only three injured, but only one was gored in the back or buttocks, depending on who was reporting.  And he's a Spaniard again.     The summary from CNN goes like this:   The final toll for this year stands at 16 people gored and another 40 individuals sent to hospital with non-goring injuries from falls or being trampled, in the eight-day running from July 7 to 14.  Javier Solano, the veteran play-by-play announcer for Spanish state television's live daily broadcasts of the running, said on air on Wednesday that the 16 people gored this year - including eight people on July 12 alone - was about twice the number of people gored most years.  ... The total of 56 runners sent to hospital this year included nine Americans, an Australian, a Frenchman, a South African, someone from Portugal and numerous Spaniards.   So all told, not really all that bad a showing.  Wait 'til next year!

      Unfortunately the runners must have had their Red Bull before the run -- They may well have had wings.  Only three minor injuries on the penultimate day, and none were gorings.  There were fewer runners, so there's still some hope for tomorrow -- Their final attempt to exact their preemptive revenge for the year.

      Surrounded by all the other living 500 home run hitters in the Juice Box for the Home Run Derby, Barry Bonds was asked what motivates him to continue to come to the ballpark, be pitched around, and occasionally go yard when someone hangs one for him (forget about not yet having a Series ring).  According to AP, his answer is The Cash.   urlLink Bills Motivates [sic] Bonds at Home Run Derby .    Do you believe it?!  He says that it's not the thrill of the chase, nor the desire to cement his place in history.  Rather, it's the money that motivates him.    Budweiser has this Leon character who encompasses all that is wrong with professional sports in his motto "If Leon ain't playin', someone ain't payin'."  For those who haven't "met" Leon, check out his  urlLink bio .    Don't even get me started about money being the motivation of athletes as opposed to real triumph (see my Olympics and Doping posting from Saturday).  Once again, the true motivation of your children's heroes comes forth.  Ugh.

      Again, it's not that I'm a tree-hugger.  I know nothing of the spotted owl, nor do I care to.  I think we should go back to hunting Bambi because the deer population has gone unchecked.  But I do know whale sharks, turtles, and divers, and because I do, I hate Red Lobster.  And I don't use that word lightly.  And tonight's  Countdown with Keith Olbermann  on MSNBC was sponsored by, you guessed it, Red Lobster.  What's a girl to do?!   Lemme tell you why I personally boycott Red Lobster and other Darden restaurants (including The Olive Garden) .  As I've previously mentioned, I've been to Roatan, Honduras three times so far and intend to go back many more times.  As well, just yesterday I wrote about a lobster diver we heard about when visiting Roatan on my second trip.  As a recap, this diver was paralyzed while violating all known diving limits to make $0.25 per lobster.  Who's the major purchaser of lobster down there?  You guessed it.  But wait; there's more.  Recently (I dunno, a few years ago), there was an embargo enacted against shrimp caught with nets that also snare turtles by the hundreds from being sold to the United States.  By a certain date, turtle-friendly nets, they would be restricted from selling to U.S. companies.  Here's the trick.  Darden continued to "buy" shrimp from Roatan, but they specifically built a huge freezer facility to hold the shrimp there until they were able to afford enough nets to pass inspection (not replace their whole fleet) and the embargo was lifted.  Then the shrimp, caught with illegal nets for literally months and months, were allowed in the U.S.    Turtles are my favorite.  My happiest birthday was diving and seeing my first turtle underwater.  What's especially frightening is that Hurricane Mitch hit in 1998 right as the turtle broods were hatching, hitting the juvenile population hard.  The resort I go to,  urlLink CoCoView , actually built a sanctuary for hawksbill turtles, including protected pens and a release program, after Mitch.  I cannot abide by the needless mass slaughter of turtles.    So here I am, someone who only boycotts Darden Restaurants and Middle East Oil (not that I don't drive -- I gas up at Citgo) and her favorite TV show is sponsored by Darden.  So, what should I do?  I mean, it's not like I'm a Nielson home and they'd know I was watching a Darden-sponsored show.  As well, the sponsorship is not going to make me change my mind; not by a long-shot.    So I'll do what I can.  If you feel that Darden acts irresponsibly, just to be able to offer 30 overcooked shrimp for under $10, then please join me in my boycott.  If not, then you enjoy that poor excuse for seafood.  Either way, check out the  Countdown .

      Just another manic Monday?  More manic than usual.  Eight people gored, one person was actually gored five times (another local), with a total of 18 people injured today.  While this local received the worst of it on a personal level, it seemed the city of New York was a target with two New Yorkers among the seriously injured (but only one was a goring).     The attack on the local happened during a pile-up just short of the entrance to the ring and the attack was carried out by a singular bull.  Clearly, this bull has been reading my blog, because he spent his last moments of freedom very well.    Of the eight gored, one was American (Brooklyner who would only give his initials) and a Frenchman.  The remaining six, including the unfortunate fellow mentioned above, were Spaniards, at least three from Pamplona.    A great summary was provided by  CNN.com :   Forty-nine runners, including 15 who were gored and the rest with injuries due to falls or stampeding, have been taken to hospitals since the event began July 7.   The 49 include eight Americans, an Australian, a Frenchman, a South African, someone from Portugal and numerous Spaniards. The run ends July 14.       Come on, bulls!  Only two more shots until next year!

      Senators in the Intelligence Committee are calling for the White House to name outgoing CIA chief George Tenet's replacement as soon as possible, citing the current threat the U.S. is under as the AP reports in  urlLink Senators Press White House on CIA Chief .  With the rampant success Bush's White House has had in getting appointees approved (sarcasm, if you didn't catch that), I wonder if, right before the elections, the Democrats in the senate want to have divisive confirmation hearings to undermine Bush's major plank in his platform -- That the country is safer with him at the helm.     Tenet was the perfect scapegoat for 9/11.  Again, I'm not a conspiracy theorist and I'm also more Republican-leaning than Democrat, but I think his being a hold-over from Clinton put him in the perfect spot to take the fall for failures that led to 9/11.  You need only be a student of the U.S. Government in the most simple sense of the word to have figured this out from the outset.  But this will be a tougher decision than most think, coming up with Tenet's replacement.    This will have to be someone with an eye to the future who's opposed to the business-as-usual history of the CIA.  Someone willing to make changes.  But someone who not only wouldn't be set up as the scapegoat for the next government if the Dems win in November, but also would be amenable to Kerry-Edwards to keep during the transition.  Anyone knows there's a huge risk at putting someone in a position for a couple of months only to have them replaced.  That lame-duck title would put America at a greater risk.    I do believe that Bush knows this and is trying to choose someone who could serve in that position for multiple years, regardless of the party in the Oval Office at the time.  And to achieve that, you have to pick someone with impeccable experience in the field with an eye to the future, but also as less a politician as one can get from Langley.  It should be interesting.    Whomever and whenever Bush chooses to fill this position, I do know that the confirmation hearings will be the expected partisan sniping and more opening of the 9/11 wound.  So I can see where Bush might just want to sit on this nomination for as long as possible.  If he does that, he will need to do what he can to show the world that the interim director, John McLaughlin, has full grip on the reins of the Agency and the full support of the White House, something Bush hasn't been able to do until today, the day Tenet officially stepped down, but must do in the days and weeks to come.

      Back in one of my favorite parts of the world, there seems to be the classic struggle between modernization and the protection of natural resources.  Seems Guanaja, the next island over from Roatan in Honduras' Islas de la Bahia, is looking to build a road to better serve the growing needs of tourists.  This road just happens to run smack through the land where Susan Hendrickson, a renown fossil hunter, decided to settle and eventually build a nature park.  The  Trib  did a great, detailed write up in their story  urlLink Fossil hunter has bone to pick with island road .     If you don't recognize the name, you'd recognize her discovery if you've ever been to Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History.  She's the scientist who discovered the most complete set of T-Rex bones ever found, later named Sue in Hendricksons' honor.      While I've never been to Guanaja, it sounds as though they are having the same problems that Roatan had, especially after Hurricane Mitch came through in '98.  While the locals got lumber to rebuild their stilted houses in the bays and lagoons and some really ugly paint to finish them off, the couple of rich locals (who'd become rich while illegally fishing and shrimping) were able to get funds to build huge mansions on prime land, never formally owned by anyone but assumed to belong to locals.  These few Hondurans on Roatan are connected to the vast majority of the income on the island from both tourism and the fishing trades.    The second time I was in Roatan, we ended up at the chamber at Anthony's Key Resort (long story, but we all knew she wasn't bent, though she insisted she was, so we took her there).  Getting treatment was a lobster worker who was seriously bent and paralyzed from the waist down.  He was down at 160ft, being shuttled tank after tank after tank while harvesting lobsters for which he would be paid $0.25 each, when he turned around to find his tank empty and no replacement.  Shooting to the surface after hours at that depth, there was no way for his tissue to off-gas all that nitrogen, and one particular bubble in his spinal cord knocked out communications to his lower limbs.  This wasn't the first time he was bent, nor would it likely be the last -- See, you don't need your legs for that type of diving, so he would be back to work as soon as his treatments were over.    While Hendrickson might be right in her opposition to the road, she has one key strike against her: she's white.  It seems that the locals have no problem working for the locals when they treat them or the environment badly, but have quite the reaction to certain caucasians coming in and making money, even if it isn't as clearly at their expense as what the rich locals do.    In my opinion, she should try to work with the people of Guanaja instead of simply opposing their progress.  It's in everyone's best interest to keep the island and reef as pristine as it is, and if she can get that message across and work together to keep it that way, she will have done a great thing.  It is their island, and to deny them their first road is to subjugate them, a role they are all too familiar with.

      Only one goring today; victim is a 36-year-old woman from Pamplona.  Again, I find it interesting that the bulls are going after the Spaniards.  Only two other injuries were reported: an ankle and a busted shoulder.  But I thought the weekend was going to bring more injuries?!  Come on, bulls!  Only a few more days to proactively exact your revenge.    Today's run, however, was the fastest yet, completed in 2.5 minutes.  Methinks these poor bulls have absolutely no idea what awaits them, or they'd be having a bit more fun.  Someone needs to remind them that getting there is half (all) the fun!

      When I think of cheating in the Olympics, I think of Eastern Bloc nations.  The East German Women's Swim Team comes to mind, and I use that term "women" very loosely in that case.  Or even the Scandinavians with the epoetin use in Salt Lake and the forfeited medals.  Now, the U.S. is seemingly the center around which the controversy of performance-enhancing drugs swirls.  Are events like Marion Jones missing the cut for the 100m and Lance Armstrong bowing out indicators that our leading athletes do flout the system, or are they simply media-induced fatigue?    To put things into perspective, there are some things to consider.  Neither Jones nor Armstrong has been found to be using performance-enhancing drugs in any drug test they've taken.  As well, you have each athlete under different real-life pressures -- Jones is the mother of a one-year-old and Armstrong is going through a messy divorce and is likely thinking about the time he spends away from his family.  And, Marion does have the 200m, long jump, and relays yet to make the team.    Another thing to consider is that there has been a cyclist thrown out of the TdF for using illegal substances.  Funny thing about that is that it's methadone and there's no way I can think that that will help your performance in such an endurance race.  Any resonable organization should consider the possibility of an inaccurate test before tossing someone's career aside.  As well, we are forced to consider the possibility that those athletes named in BALCO ledgers did not, in fact, take p-e drugs, as there is no direct evidence to prove otherwise.  Now, however, only with circumstantial evidence, the USADA is considering bans of several premiere athletes for life.  But, by the same token, an athlete should consider taking p-e drugs as tossing their career aside.  Heck, even the consideration of using such drugs puts your career at risk, as those under consideration by USADA will tell you.  So, thanks to today's undercurrent of suspicion, nearly everyone's career is at risk as well as the future of sports themselves.    Sport has become so much less a competition of skill and so much more a competition of money-making.  You can understand how athletes are driven to using drugs to increase their incomes.  And now, the development of these undetectable drugs is a huge growth-market, only slowed by the BALCO investigation.  Because it takes very little effort to continually change the signature of these drugs, the effort to keep ahead of the anti-doping agencies is barely an effort at all.  So easy, in fact, that I hold that no one in their right mind can even think of saying the U.S. Olympic Team is clean by virtue of their drug tests.  Couple that with the clear, ever-present use of p-e drugs in American professional sports, from Lou Alzado to Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa, and you just might make the point that it's cultural.    So, is there anything that can be done to shake the cloud of suspicion hanging over U.S. sport -- Amateur and Professional?  I think the only way this will clear is through a combination of the labs who formerly made these designer drugs helping to develop better testing methods or monitoring of the industry coupled with the absolute intolerance of the use of any aids at all across all of U.S. sport.  Standardize the drug testing policy and enforcement across the entire U.S., and start it early, say at the high school level.  With this strong stance to keep athletics a purely skill-based competition, we might be able to teach our kids that if you make the most of the skills God gave you, you can hold your head up high regardless of your finish and that achieving greatness any other way is hollow.

      Only two gorings today -- And they were both Spaniards.  Puzzling!  One was hit in the leg and the other in the buttocks.  Anyone else only able to say "buttocks" now in your best Forrest Gump?  Four other minor injuries were reported.  Today's run included a five-bull pileup at the hairpin turn (I kid you not) and a human sandwiched in the middle of them at  the time.  And I haven't yet found a picture of that, or I'd have linked to it!    Tune in here for regular updates through the 14th.    I dunno if I said this yet, but for any who might think I'm a tree-hugger or PETA supporter or something, I'm not.  Not by a long-shot.  I just don't like cruelty for the sake of cruelty or amusement toward people or beast, unless we're talking family members.  Other countries have done away with bullfighting to the death, and even though I'm a fan of tradition, some traditions do need modernization.  As well, I think you have to either be the most macho person with a huge inferiority complex or just plain old stupid to run in front of bulls on slippery cobblestone streets for 3 minutes. So, in my opinion, those injured get no sympathy from me.

      The World Court has ruled that the wall separating Palestinian-settled areas of Israel from Jewish-settled areas is illegal.  Details of the ruling appeared in Reuters' story  urlLink World Court Rules Israel's Barrier Illegal .  Palestinians are already talking about asking for U.N. sanctions against Israel, as Israel is in violation of international law.  As well, tensions have already been running high around the dissolution of the Jewish Settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.  Will this ruling end up pushing Israel to stop doing things that hinder the progess of peace, or will it tear Israel apart?    I find it hard to believe that this ruling will not create international stress.  The one dissenting judge is from, drumroll please...  The U.S.  And if the U.N. is pulled in to decide on sanctions, then that's going to, once again, pit the U.S. against many other key U.N. countries.    This could prove a turning point in U.S.-Arab relations if the U.S. decides to have some backbone and tell Israel that they can look out for their sovereignty but they can't break the law.  If we decide to do that, it will build our credibility on the Arab Street as most think we are acting as an arm of the Israeli government.  If we can break away from that by showing that Israel cannot act with impunity, even within their borders, Arabs might start to believe that our actions in the Middle East are motivated by the needs of the U.S. and the world at large.    A more immediate, palpable result will be the reactions of each side to whatever the U.N. (and the world) decides and the Israeli government's response.  If somehow the U.N. does not impose sanctions, it could get very ugly for any country who voted against sanctions; if the U.S. pulled out the veto, then it's all over for us in the eyes of Arabs.  If sanctions are imposed, the Palestinians will be empowered.  But if the Israeli government responds with defiance by not removing the wall or not hindering the appearance of more Jewish settlements, there will be huge backlash.  I would expect at the very least for attacks on the wall itself, coupled with the predictable increase in suicide bombings.  As well, if the U.S. for some strange reason decides not to support the sanctions imposed by the U.N., that will open us up for attacks, most likely on our embassies -- It'll be like the early '80's all over again!  This time, though, that would mean lights out at the U.N.  But the most interesting dynamic to consider is if the Israeli government does start to cave to international pressure and tear down the wall as well as immediately dismantle Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.  Jews would be torn into two -- Those who simply want the violence to stop and those who think they have a right to the Holy Land and will defend that at all cost.  You then potentially have two opposing groups, splitting the Israeli focus, and one highly united group of Palestinians.  If civil war of that kind, Jew against Jew, does break out, the Jewish State might just crumble under the weight.    To put this into perspective, I'm a strong believer that the assignment of Palestine to appease the Zionist movement was wrong -- Historically, nations are built through war and acquisition, not boobie prizes awarded by a group with no real authority over the area.  But these sorts of land grabs/assignments abound in the 20th Century -- Just look at what we did to Central Africa.  I understand the motivation -- The Jews have been persecuted over the years, and not just during WWII.  But it should not have been done at the expense of a whole nation and its historic people, even if for the benefit of an historic people.  Hopefully, all sides involved will look 20 years down the line when making their decisions of the next few months instead of carrying on the fine tradition of myopic decision-making when it comes to the nations of Israel and Palestine.

      Making up for a slow start in the first two days, the bulls make up for it in a banner day with four gorings.  Reuters is reporting in their story,  urlLink Bulls Gore Four on Third Day of Pamplona Fiesta , that nine people were attended to at hospital with four having been gored.     Included in the gored were a young man from Oxford, a man of the same age from Louisiana, and, in a surprising turn, two Spaniards.  I'm guessing the man from Oxford isn't in attendance at the University -- He received a groin wound.  Ouchie!    Looking forward to the weekend, the Red Cross says with the increase in volume of runners on the weekend, the injuries are likely to continue to climb.  Which brings about another question: How many annual events do you know that bring out the Red Cross to help out?!  Here's the saddest part.  The Spanish national health service is reporting 17 treatments for alcohol intoxication on Thursday, in stark contrast to the six falls and five bruises from the run itself.    Alright, bulls...  You have the lead now -- Take advantage of the next couple of days because you've got ultimately no chance once you're in the bull ring!

      'Tis a sad, sad day when a pub in Ireland closes for any reason, but this is especially sad:  urlLink Irish Pub Closes Over Smoking Ban .  In the spirit of an Irish wake, however, there are some interesting stories within this one.     First, the article is written by someone who doesn't even know how to spell his own name!  Shawn Pogatchnik is the AP writer -- Who let him in Ireland with a name like that?!  Then, the backstory is that the owner flouted the law, advocating smoking in his pub for the past few days.  What's the owner's name, you ask?  Lawless.    Other owners around the country have been allowing smoking, either through tacit consent or by allowing it in the backroom and hoping the officials stay away.  This reminds me of the time where I sat with an officer in the Garda, God rest his soul, in a pub as it "closed" at 10pm, though we stayed and drank, with the lights down and shades pulled, until the wee hours of the morning.  So you knew it was going to happen -- That those who wanted to smoke, would.    Best of all in this story is the closing.  Not being able to recreate it any better than the original telling, here it is:   "Have I been defying the ban since its inception? The answer is yes, just because of necessity," said Denis Maher, a nonsmoker who runs a pub in the town of Laragh in County Tipperary.   Maher, who visited Fibber Magees on Wednesday night and spent the evening chatting with other pub owners, said he had one customer, 84-year-old Paddy Doran, who's been lighting up as usual for the past three months.   "I do inform the customers that it is against the law — but Paddy's as deaf as a post," Maher said. "He'll say, `What, what, what?' and then he'll proceed to his spot by the fireplace. There are nonsmokers in the pub who know Paddy well and they don't object."    Now that's the Ireland I've come to know and love!  Pubs equal a good pint, good craic, and a fag.  Period.

      Reuters is reporting that 1.8 tons of nuclear material was moved out of Iraq for safe-keeping, according to their article,  urlLink Iraq Confirms U.S. Has Removed Nuclear Material .  Anyone who knows me knows I'm not a big fan of conspiracy theories, but I have to say this whole story makes me chuckle.  Not only is it announced just as the Dems are getting a bounce from the Veep announcement, but it's also not being announced by the U.S., rather the U.N. and verified by the brand-spankin' new Iraqi government.    According to a report to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the material was moved on June 23rd.  It makes perfect sense not to announce that they were in possession of it and moving it out of the country, but having moved it out of the country by the 23rd, you'd think someone would have said something in the past two weeks.  I know there has been a lot going on these past couple of weeks, but methinks I smell some sandbags.  What makes it even more interesting is that it's the U.N. that actually released this notification of the IAEA.  No comment other than that from the U.N.  No grand press conference to show that nuclear materials were recovered from Iraq, because then they might have to admit that their efforts of the past 13 years that they insisted were working, that were the excuse not to go to war, were all for naught.    What really scares me though is that, though I watch the news and have followed this closely, I don't recall hearing about this facility, nor the fact that it had been looted!  Um, of all the news I hear out of Iraq, this one would have been interesting to know!  Interesting to read is that the article starts by saying it was recovered from the looters, but then cites a U.S. official as saying it was removed from the facility (from which it had been looted).  I can do rather advanced math, but this doesn't add up.  I am curious to know exactly how and where this was recovered.    So, if this holds up, they'll find the bioweapons next week and Osama right after the Democratic National Convention.

      Really...  Someone's gotta 'splain that to me.  I thought for sure there were a couple of wins here, at this almost home venue.  Now we have to go to St. Louis with a huge uphill climb ahead of us.  But there are some things to look forward to.     To start, there's the All-Star Break itself.  Some time to rest, take a look at what remains of the season, and steel yourself against the trials to come.  As well, I'm sure there are a couple of players out there who could use a nap!  Or at least some kinder, gentler moments.    Then there's the prospect of Kerry coming back this weekend and Gonzo has to be getting ready to come back as well.  If we can get the offense back, we could be unstoppable.    As I've said before, we're gonna need some help at the end of the season from some other teams, but I still think the playoffs and Series are achievable this season.  From my lips...

      "Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones."  Well, not quite, but it does pack quite the wallop.  With a record drought ongoing in Australia, people of Canberra are warned to steer clear of roos ( urlLink Australia's Capital Warned Over Aggressive 'Roos ).     Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the capital of Australia is not Sydney, or even Melbourne; it's Canberra.    But on to the real subject of this story...  Australia cracks me up because there's danger around every turn; dingoes eating your babies, everything in the water is deadly, killer bugs running around the city center of Sydney, kangaroos drowning your puppydogs.  I can't wait to visit there, but I'll make sure my insurance, both health and life, is up to date.    To put all kidding aside, this does speak to the standard problem around the world of the human ecosystem encroaching on others' ecosystems.  Oceans are being cleared of native species by people feeding them boiled eggs and dumping aquaria out as they tire of them.  Here in Chicago we are constantly hearing about deer and coyote problems as we stretch farther and farther into where they live.  I don't mind moving into those areas as we need them -- I mind that we don't respect that they lived there first and we have to do what we can to live as their guests.

      I know it's only day one, but the result is rather disappointing: No gorings or serious injuries.  Is it the bulls or the participants, or is it the new rules put forth by Pamplona?  Speaking to the participants, Dennis Rodman ran with a friend with MS, though there's no comment in the story from the AP,  urlLink Several Trampled in Spain Bull Run , about what The Worm was wearing at the time.     It is early, so there's always hope that the bulls will get some good licks in before they are led into the ring.  I have to believe there's no real change to the approach by the bulls -- They don't see the video of last year before setting out on their run.  And if they did, knowing what awaited them in the ring, they just might choose to get a manicure instead.    But I have to wonder if, because of the growth of the event over the years, people aren't taking this more seriously than before.  It used to be a devil-may-care approach to this risk-taking endeavor, but now people train for this!  Not that I disagree with this approach -- Any potentially fatal activity should be taken seriously.  But in the past, it was just something a bunch of guys up and did.  It takes something off it for me.    It seems the Pamplona police are restricting access to the streets by people who are too intoxicated to run safely -- Two Aussies were the people of note who were turned down.  As liquor and the Running are so tightly related, this is a bit interesting.  I mean, who'd run who wasn't loaded?    Then, how was it that Rodman was allowed to run?  Sorry... couldn't resist!  :)  But you gotta give him props, running with his friend like that.  He does have soft spots under all those tatts and piercings.    Here's hoping the bulls catch their stride and put a solid number of people in the hospital!  Darwin loves the Festival of San Fermin!   P.S. To be fair, the slideshow did show Dennis in the traditional white with red scarf -- But we have seen Dennis in traditional white before.  Yeah, you remember, the wedding dress.  I just couldn't resist that comment as a hook in the introduction!

      Trying to keep my inner cynic in check by my inner Pollyanna, I read an article in the  Christian Science Monitor  today,  urlLink The happiest place in Iraq: Baghdad's marriage bureau .  There's a reported 75-100% increase in marriages since the overthrow of Saddam's government.  Are people happier?  Are they looking for some glimmer of hope and stability in their lives?  Are they freer to "get it on" now that Saddam's folks aren't peeking around corners?   Geez, I hope it's at the very least a combination of increased happiness and freedom.  The article goes through an excellent analysis of some of the factors in this change, including  the abolition of required military service and pay raises for women cutting into the price of a dowry.  It's definitely worth the read!  As I'm constantly reminded by those over in Iraq, there are good things coming out of our involvement there.  And, in my opinion, here's yet another!

      This should prove to be an interesting decision, though ultimately I still hold that no VP choice would change this fall's race from one that is Bush's to lose.  Putting aside the idea that nothing anyone does will affect the outcome of the race (being that security, Iraq, and the economy will decide the election), there are many pros and cons about Edwards in the two-hole.   Not the least of which will be how they quash the shortcomings Kerry himself called out about Edwards during the primary cycle.  They can't all of a sudden say Edwards is no longer inexperienced in government or foreign affairs.  So this should be a field day for the ad writers for the President's campaign -- They won't need a voice-over.  They'll just clip together all the times that Kerry ripped on Edwards' experience!  Who better to give testimony than the candidate himself?!  As well, you have a man who's early in his career who's likely going to take this opportunity to make a name for himself.  He'll likely be as in the fore as Cheney, in stark opposition to many VPs past.  So it will be interesting to see if there might be a thought to the 2008 election cycle where Kerry and Edwards might yet again be opponents.    Then there's the stigma of Edwards' past life as a class action lawyer.  While the one side can tout that he defends the rights of the little people (read: Democrats), the other side can run up the flagpole the thought that he made millions of dollars on the backs of the same little people.  This courtroom experience, however, will put him on good footing in the debates against Cheney, but I think Cheney's vast experience will shine brighter in a one-on-one debate against Edwards (or any candidate for that matter).  Cheney is very skilled at quickly hitting the high notes, ripping at the core of his opponent -- My memories of his performances during the Iran-Contra Hearings still ring clear.      One good point is the complementary nature of the Kerry-Edwards ticket.  Catholic vs. Protestant, Northerner vs. Southerner, oldie vs. young gun, stiff vs. personable, and life-long politician vs. neophyte.  It does make for an interesting ticket.  Except for the fact that they are both bleeding heart liberals.  Finally, there's the John-John issue.  Both candidates are Johns...  Can you hear their speeches and exchanges already?  You won't know if they are pulling a Bob Dole, talking about themselves in the third person, or talking about their running mate.  I do believe this is the first time in the modern era that the pres. and VP have the same first name.    So, would that the choice of VP actually had anything to do with this election, or for that matter any election, this would make for an interesting study.

      Thank goodness for small favors --  urlLink Coach K Turned Down the Lakers .  The game is not at all interesting, the players are overpaid, and the games are more and more predictable.  OK, ok, I know...  I'm just a bitter Chicago fan who was spoiled by MJ.  I'm sure that's a good part of it -- Why should I bother with the sport when I've seen it played at its best.  However, I think my assessment isn't all that far off.  Take this past season, for example.     Every time I happened across an NBA game this season, the score at the time was 42-23, late in the second quarter.  The leading team was pushing, but the lagging team seemed resolved to lose the game.  I'm not exaggerating; there were at least 10 times I tuned in and saw the same thing.    College basketball is so much more interesting a game, admittedly a bit because of the ultimate payoff if a player does make it to the NBA.  Players in the NBA get paid ridiculous amounts of money, even though very few teams still draw enough fans to merit the salaries, much less to be able to pay said salaries.  So college basketball is the farm system for the NBA (much as Europe was 10 or 15 years ago) and every game is a tryout.    But you also have kids who love the game, who know they will never have the opportunity to play on such a stage after their eligibility is up, busting their butts to play a game they love at a level they relish.  The "never say die" attitude abounds and the game is exciting and fast-paced, but not frenetic.  You have kids playing through injury or while trying to make sure they have a life when their eligibility runs out by studying engineering or chemistry instead of Leisure Studies.    Now that Coach K isn't going to the NBA, I still have no reason to watch.  And for that I am grateful.

      Honestly...  Once Kerry announces his running mate, the air is out of the sails for the presidential race, just as it has for the past four conventions or so.  As the  NY Times  points out in its article,  urlLink Fears of Attack at Conventions Drive New Plans , the draw of the conventions this year are giving security professionals the yips.  (and yes, I know you have to subscribe to read this -- it's free so sign up already!)  If only the terrorists knew that no one will be watching, and few will think the republic will fail if these politicians are taken out.     I have to say, while holding the Republican National Convention in NYC is quite the symbolic message, it's the rock-dumbest thing I've heard of in a while.  You're not only puttng Madison Square Garden at risk, but also Penn Station among other marquee spots in NYC.  And if something does go wrong, it is entirely possible that NYC tourism would never recover.  Not to mention that if something does go wrong, Bush takes the hit and loses the election.    So when you couple that with the insignificance of party conventions, it makes no sense at all to make these either more important than they are or, by extension, make them a target of terrorism.  The last convention I remember being of any interest at all was the 1980 convention with Reagan's choice of VP going down to eleventh hour discussions with Ford, finally picking Bush only moments before taking the stage.  Since then, to my recollection, there have been no surprises.    This election will hinge on three things (two of which are intimately related): National security, Iraq, and the economy.  If there are attacks on the U.S. and/or the situation in Iraq gets much worse, Bush will continue to slide.  If the economy stalls, Bush will continue to slide.  It's not even a matter of Kerry pushing ahead -- You could be running Richie Daley against Bush and he'd still be elected if the right conditions fall into place.    So, let's dump the conventions and just get on with this!

      Seemingly every week there's a new story here in Chicago about a child killed by a parent or a caregiver.  More and more, things are being done, well attempted, to make it easier for a parent of a child for whom they cannot care to be able to, without repercussion, put the care of that child in others' hands.  Hearing the latest of the tragic stories,  urlLink Woman Charged In Stabbing Death Of Her Newborn , it simply makes me want to cry.   Not only is there a program where a newborn can be dropped off at a hospital or firehouse or the like here in Chicago, there are also several agencies that can accept children with no questions asked.  Sometimes people think they can handle having a child, but find out rather quickly that they are ill-equipped.  How much easier can it be?!  This one is even more disturbing in that the child was not left in a dumpster or in a park as many of these children are.  Rather, she stabbed this child to death and heaved him out her third-storey window.  (I say him so as not to confuse with the mother, though the news has not distinguished the sex of the child.)  This wasn't despair -- This was hatred.  Anyone familiar with murders will tell you stabbings are more often than not a result of closely felt hatred.  It kind of makes me grateful for the child's passing; that he did not have to grow up in that cyclone of hate.    I think of all the adoptive parents out there -- People who are unable to have children of their own -- who would have loved this child, loved the opportunity to love this child.  It's maddening to see so many suffer who could, would that people understood the weight of the burden of bringing children into the world and the ways that that burden can be lifted legally, be paired up and make twice as many happy.

      One of my favorite phrases is, "I can't win for losing."  Well, looking at some things that have transpired lately in the wonderful world of baseball, it seems some teams can't win for losing (and not in the way the Tigers almost did last year).  It's all about the timing.   Let's start by talking trades.  Miguel Olivo was traded by the White Sox just this past Sunday.  What happens Thursday, just as he's settling in with the Mariners?  He goes on the DL with kidney stones -- Not even a work-related injury!  There's no way you could have seen that coming!  Then, just today, the Cubs traded a great young pitcher, Jimmy Anderson -- Deja vu all over again, perhaps?  I certainly hope not.  But, during today's game, Carlos Zambrano suffered forearm cramps, finally knocking him out of the game.  Assuming this isn't anything serious, the trade is a footnote to the season.  If it's a continuation of our starting pitcher health problems, well this could be goat-like.    As well, that trade got us a minor league pitcher...  fine...  whatever...  Except Aramis Ramirez went out of today's game with a groin (pull or just strain, we don't yet know).  With Gonzalez still out and Hollandsworth, a force off the bench in any defensive position, going on the DL, if we lose another infielder, we might be in serious trouble.    On the other hand, just as the BoSox could use a break, Derek Jeter takes a header into the stands for a key out in an extra-inning game that would ultimately result in a sweep of the BoSox putting them 8-1/2 games back (but still in second), while uglying up that pretty face of his.  And he doesn't miss a single game -- Poor A-Rod doesn't even get a shot at short!  Could be worse (could be raining).  Well, actually it must be raining.  From this vantage point, it looks like the Yanks have the tough part of their schedule much earlier than the BoSox, and they finish with two series against each other in September.  It could get ugly for those fans in Beantown.  Very ugly.  It's all about the timing.    Just as the Cubs could use a little push to the All-Star Break, St. Louis gets Seattle (with a record of 32-45), then a declining Reds team.  We, on the other hand, get the ChiSox who could give the Twinkies a run for their money for the AL-Central.  To be fair, though, we do go to Milwaukee after that.  But then, we go to the Gateway to the West to go into the Break either hanging at the top or with some serious work to do in the rest of July and August.    Last year, the NL-Central was a three-way race until the Cards came to Wrigley for a five-gamer in September -- An excellent creshendo to the season.  It was likely that that series would knock one horse out of the race, and we managed to send the Cards back to Busch Stadium in the Clydesdales' trailer.  This year, that face-off wraps up early, with a home two-game series ending the regular season match-up in July!  Last year, our future was solidly in our own hands.  This year, we're gonna need some help.    Now, here's where timing could be in our favor.  So far this season, the Cubs have yet to play a game with their assumed starting line-up available for play that day.  Kerry is due back after the All-Star Break.  Prior is hitting his stride.  Gonzalez should be back soon.  Hopefully nothing's wrong with Carlos and Aramis is back in the hot corner in a game or two.  Playing without our starters, we've managed to hang onto second in the NL-Central.  So...  if we get back to full strength and stay that way, we'll be building up steam while St. Louis has nothing to go back into the bag for.  It's gonna be tight, but it could be another great race to the end of the season to see who's on top of the division.    Timing is everything, even in baseball...  Everyone knows about the timing of the wind-up, the hit-and-run, the home run swing, heck even the timing of the shadows' creep across the infield.  Who'da thunk the timing of trades, injuries/illnesses, and the schedule could come into play as they might in this season of 162 games?  A baseball fan; that's who!

      When I think of mothering types of animals, I think of a hen with her chicks, a doe with her fawn, and a leech with its leechlings...?  I say 'its' because, as the article,  urlLink Slimy Leeches Are Devoted Parents , pointed out, leeches are hermaphrodites; not that there's anything wrong with that.  But according to Australian researchers, leeches are very supportive, nurturing parents, especially for invertebrates, but more so even than some vertebrates I know.  Have I mentioned lately that I love internet news services?!  So the next time your mother is smothering you, tell her she's a mother leech.  And if that doesn't get you sent to your room, I don't know what will!!!

      Saddam was told formally of the charges against him today.  Big whoopdee do.  This coming from a news addict, even.  While I enjoy that MSNBC was able to pull out the Iraq score again, I have to say this is much ado about nothing on all counts.  Scott Peterson will be tarred and feathered, or worse, before Saddam sees trial, but even with the markets being hit by bad news, the Saudis going after militants, a rocket attack in Gaza, the first enforcement of port protection regulations, Coach K talking to the Lakers, sarin shells found in Iraq, and news of a cure for hiccups, Saddam being read charges engulfs the news like Mr. Creasote at the buffet!   I love hearing the analysis -- Political and military -- but even I have had enough.  All I needed was to hear Saddam's responses in his voice with the translation as a caption and a couple of interviews with Stormin' Norman and others.  I got that; now I've had enough.    This is going to drag on longer than O.J. and Milosevic combined and have a similar combined tone!  He's not going to go on trial unless and until the new government is put into place, at the earliest the start of next year.  Meanwhile, I hope the hearing tomorrow is the extent of it until then.    It is important that this happen in Iraq and openly communicated for all to hear, especially the Arab Street.  I just hope I don't have to unplug the cable box when, for the next 9 months, because all that shows up on it is Jacko, Saddam, and Kobe.

      They are both flip floppers who are actually more liberal then they sell themselves as being.  As though I needed another reason not to vote for Keyes, including his being a carpetbagger and being annoying, he's also coming out in support of Reparations, according to the  Chicago Tribune  in  urlLink Keyes has plan for reparations; He would exempt blacks from taxes  (Subscription service -- It's free, though).     While Keyes sells himself as a Republican and conservative, he has come down on the more liberal sides of issues strictly to sell himself to the African-American community in the Chicago Metro area (neatly coupled with his taking an apartment in Calumet City).  He's on record, twice at least, in opposition to reparations specifically, and entitlement programs in general for the most part.  Now, out of the blue, or black if you will, he's for exempting African-Americans from paying taxes.  Speaking of promising to have pizza four days a week in the caf...  First, it's entirely unmanageable.  Second, it's rewarding people who weren't slaves, who might not have even been slaves, and even those who have only just come to the U.S. recently.    But most importantly, there are many groups that were similarly, not exactly in the same manner, exploited by the U.S. throughout the years.  The Chinese and other immigrants built the railroad and performed other tasks in their indentured servitude that others would not do.  Meanwhile, many of these indentured servants were never released as the contract holders refused to recognize their service as complete, or they died while working in those dangerous jobs that no one else would do.  Irish and Italians, among others, were discriminated against for years, being denied jobs and housing.  Yet there's no talk about exempting Chinese restaurants, pubs, and pizza joints from taxation.    Meanwhile, Barack Obama, the real candidate for the U.S. Senate seat in Illinois, said the most reasonable thing I've ever heard a black man say about Reparations:  "I generally think that the best strategies for moving forward involve vigorously enforcing our anti-discrimination laws in education and job training and other programs that can lift all people out of poverty."

      It made sense to have troops in Central Europe after WWII.  It even made sense during the Cold War.  Now, finally, almost 60 years after the armistices of WWII, we are pulling back troops stationed all over the world.  President Bush announced this reorganization to support current military goals today, as reported by Reuters in  urlLink U.S. to Remove Up to 70,000 Troops from Europe, Asia .     While it still makes sense to maintain facilities at, say, Landstuhl, Okinawa, and Riyadh, to provide a global logistical reach, there are very few reasons why we need to maintain troops in small bases throughout the world.  These bases include those that were established solely to point weapons at the Eastern Bloc, which is no longer a threat.  There are more than 5,400 of these military installations across the world, many of which no longer have any strategic importance.    I think this is an outstanding step being taken to better position our troops to be used in the defense of the United States as well as in the support and execution of U.S. foreign policy.  There is one serious downside: There are communities in foreign countries worldwide that are entire in existence to support U.S. military installations.  While you hear, for example, Okinawans asking for us to leave their island, you will also hear business owners asking them to stay.    But this will go miles not only to provide a more stable homelife for many servicemen and women, bringing the potential for being stationed out of the country to a minimum, but it will also provide the military a flexible, deployable force with fewer administrative positions.  Here's something I haven't read so far in the analysis that I see as a plus as well: This will bring 70,000 troops and 100,000 family members and civilians back to jobs here in the U.S., spending money at the little diner in town and at the Wal-Mart as well as the PX.    This is a win-win-win-win situation.  Win for servicemen and families.  Win for U.S. security.  Win for the U.S. economy (especially those small towns that support bases that are now empty because of the deployment to the Middle East).  Win for all those lily-livered kids who soiled themselves when the word "draft" reappeared recently.

      Do I care about the U.S. Men's Basketball team?  Obviously not, say you regular readers.  Do I care about U.S. Men's Soccer?  They didn't even qualify for the Olympics!  Do I care about Men's Volleyball, indoor or beach?  Other than for the obvious (yummy men), no, I really don't.  But do I care about the Women's teams in these sports?  Heck yeah!  Not only have women's sports reach the pinnacle of involvement, but they've hit the nexus with public interest at the same moment as the Athens Olympics.     The intent of Title IX is great: To provide women the opportunity to compete in Collegiate sports with the same variety as is available to men.  The execution of Title IX was stupid.  As a general opponent of entitlement programs, I was and am opposed to dictating the exact number of spots available to women.  Early on, this forced less skilled participants onto a very public stage.  For example, when I was growing up, we had volleyball, basketball, or softball to choose from as team sports along with Track and Cross Country.  When Title IX came in, there were few women who were immediately prepared to participate competitively in other sports.    Now is the Olympics of women who grew up under Title IX, who know nothing but sport as a way of life.  I look at my brother's daughters.  At six-and-a-half, they have played as many sports competitively as I had my entire life.  They haven't quite played as many sports as I did for fun, however, but that's a product of today's soccer mom/playdate society.  So, now that the Title IX babies have claimed the stage, not only do you watch the women in gymnastics or swimming or equestrian, but you also watch them in soccer, beach volleyball, basketball, softball, and rowing.  And you aren't just watching because it's on (thank you, NBC!), but rather because it's exciting to watch.  Even more so than the men's sports, I would argue.    Here's to women athletes like Pam Schaffrath, a girl I went to high school with who joined the volleyball team so she had something to do while waiting for basketball and softball to come up, a woman who eventually played on the Silver Bullets Women's Baseball Team, a woman ahead of her time.  And here's to the multitude of Pams to come as a result of the level playing field brought about by Title IX in its purest intent.

      Before Charley took its right turn into the Florida coast, farther south than the expected point of landfall at Tampa Bay, I thought of how lucky my Godfather was that his first full year in Florida didn't provide him with the opportunity to use his storm shutters.  Once Charley turned, I held my breath for him.  Fortunately, there's word finally this morning that all's well.     We'd heard on Saturday afternoon that the house (about 30 miles south of Punta Gorda where the storm came on shore) stood up fine, but the landscaping was gone.  Not torn apart, not ruined.  Gone.  He's going to be doing his best impression of the Knights Who Say Ni: Bring me a shrubbery!  At the same time, we found out that he was without power and phone, as well as having no cell signal (a horror for Uncle Jim -- He lives and dies by that thing!).  But at that point we knew he and Aunt Val were safe, which in that moment was most important.  So our focus changed.    What we didn't know is how his boat faired.  He'd moved it out of harm's way, but as harm's way was a dynamic sort of thing, there was no way to tell if it was OK.  My godfather is the reason I love the water.  He had sailboats all my life on Lake Michigan, moving to slow power cruisers only when his hip replacements kept him from being able to do all the work he'd done on his sailboats.  When they decided to move to Florida, they had a boat purchased long before they had a home purchased.  For a while here in Chicago on two different occasions, they actually lived on their boat.  Their boats have been their lives, named after first the family make-up (Five Bells -- Val and the four girls) and later their children's names (Jevabem contains, in order, the initials of the girls).  The loss of the boat would have been significantly more an impact than the loss of the house.  So we waited with bated breath.  Until this morning when we heard the boat was perfect.  Additional good news included that their power was already restored late last night.  So all's well, thank Ja, and Jevabem lives to float another day.

      They were trounced by Puerto Rico today, handing the team their first Olympic loss since 1988.  They came out utterly flat -- I could have run on them today.  And, though they managed to cut a 22 point deficit to 8, they still looked like little better than a good high school team compared to Puerto Rico.     Everything about how they played today only went to prove my opinion of them: That they feel they deserve to win and play as a group of individual talent, not as a team.  I don't know what their passing percentage was, but this is basketball, not hockey.  As a result of the poor passing and team play in general, they were in double-digit turnovers.  While they had the advantage on the boards, couldn't sink a shot from the two-feet shorter arc to save their collective lives.    Not only is this their first loss in 16 years, but it's also the team's third loss in history, that is if you count the loss in Munich.  And if they continue coming out onto the court the way they did today, they could very well continue to lose games against a more and more competitive field.

      An Iranian athlete refused to trade tosses with an Israeli athlete in the Judo competition, reports Reuters in  urlLink Iran Defies Olympic Spirit by Shunning Israel .  This flies in the face of the spirit and creed of the Olympic games, and flies in the faces of the memories of athletes like Jesse Owens.  This is, of course, unless the Iranian athlete cited Cooties for the reason why he didn't want to grapple with the Israele.  To quote John Stossel, "Gimme a break!"     The Olympics have been an odd player in international politics.  Going back to the boycott of the 1980 Games in Moscow, countries as wholes have been able to make political statements by attending or not attending games.  And the 1972 Munich games and the assassination of the Israeli athletes made the Olympics another victim in the Israeli-Palestinian struggle.    There have been more positive ways political statements have been made.  For example, how the former Soviet republics participated in the games as the Soviet Union collapsed.  They had a need to compete as an integrated team, but didn't want to keep the spectre of the Soviet Union over their heads, so they competed under the Olympic standard.  And the brightest memory of all in overcoming politics and ignorance was not only Jesse Owens' participation in the 1936 Olympics under Hitler's swastika in Berlin, but his domination of the games, winning four gold medals.    The Olympics, however, on an athlete-by-athlete basis have never been a platform for individual expression of political will.  Not until today, anyway.  Athletes during the opening ceremony recite the Olympic creed (as do the judges and coaches) that includes the following:  "The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well."    This is coupled with the Olympic oath that states: "In the name of all the competitors, I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them, in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honour of our teams."    What was done by this Iranian athlete is in direct violation of the spirit of the Games.  As such, I think the book should be thrown at him and any member of the Iranian Olympic Committee who knew about this before it happened.   I don't disagree that the Israeli-Palestinian situation deserves more honest attention around it.  I do disagree that the place to bring this long-standing struggle to the fore is the Olympic games.  I also think it's pretty stupid to have done it with the memory of the 1972 Athletes hanging in the air.

      After WWI and WWII respectively, the West decided to carve up areas of the world they were no longer interested in ruling, such as Central Africa and the Middle East.  Not only did they hose the Palestinians out of a homeland, they also split Muslim factions on the Indian subcontinent, split two tribes among three countries in Central Africa, and did the same in many other places around the world.  And, as expected, Central Africa is back in the news again as the Hutus have slaughtered Tutsis in Burundi, according to Reuters in  urlLink Burundi Says Hutus Kill 159 in Refugee Camp .     This area has fascinated me since I learned about it in a Geography class in college.  The class was euphemistically referred to as War, but it covered the "geographic causes of international conflict."  One cause we covered was the arbitrary assignment of international borders.  While they might seem to make sense, dividing countries by natural structures such as rivers and mountains, the West never considered the social impact of dividing up social groups between or among countries.    Thus Central Africa.  The Tutsis and Hutu have been divided among Burundi, Congo (or Zaire), and Rwanda for years now.  And through the years the tribal control of these three governments ebb and flow like the tides.  It's almost like a bad game of musical chairs, but with one more chair than players instead of one less and under each chair is a different prize, each more valuable than the next.  So each of the two players wants to gain all three chairs, if possible.  Complicate that with a rather natural affinity of the minority group to government, and you have a real mess on your hands.    This time, it was less than 200 refugees who lost their lives.  Over the past 10 or 15 years, about a million have died between these two tribes over this area, with the Tutsis comprising the bulk of the dead.    This is an area of the world often overlooked, standing in the shadows of Israel and Kashmir.  While I don't think the U.S. need be involved in the struggles there, I do believe that there are valuable lessons to learn.  Not the least of those is that we need to better understand the cultures with which we interact.

      AP is reporting that the target of New Jersey's soon to be ex-governor's attention was suing for $50MM in their story  urlLink Man Sought $50M From McGreevey, Aides Say .  No wonder McGreevey came out.  That's not a lawsuit; that's either a lover scorned or blackmail.  The thought of being sued for $50MM would oust me from the closet, and I'm not even gay!     Lemme see if I have this straight (no pun intended).  A closeted Catholic politician has an affair with a man whom he provides a high-paying job in his administration for which he isn't qualified and can't get the proper security clearance, so the politician creates a job for him, and protects him from the press.  Then the guy sues him for $50MM for sexual harassment.  Rich.    But not so rich, I suppose.  But I don't think that decision not to settle, but rather to come out, had anything to do with money; sure enough he could have found a way to pay the negotiated down offer of a $5MM settlement.  It has to be a matter of principle.    Hell hath no fury...

      I was watching Olympic swimming tonight and I have a complaint about the intrusion of technology into the sport.  I understand the value the new technology swimsuit material provides -- I happen to own one of those Speedo suits with the channeling technology from Sydney.  I'm complaining about how all the guys are wearing bodysuits now.     There's nothing quite like the muscular V bodyshape of a swimmer; the trapezius and deltoid combination just gets me going.  But now they've covered that all up!  They are wearing bodysuits right up to their necks and down to their ankles and wrists.  Some, fortunately, are wearing the tank version of the suit, but that happens to look just like mine (though mine's only knee-length) so there's a bit of a turnoff factor there.    Now, I happen to not mind the Track and Field unitard, which on many leaves NOTHING to the imagination, especially as a fan of the male behind.  As well, it's kinda fun to watch the uni changes with the male gymnasts (who find themselves being interviewed with their unitard pulled down to their waist, shucks golly gee darn).  But I have to protest the use of full bodysuits by swimmers.  I mean, why would I watch then, other than the fact that it's scintillating competition.  ;)  On a more serious note, U.S. Men's Gymnastics was screwed tonight.  First, two days ago during practice, the head judge notified the U.S. that Jayson Gatson's and Blaine Wilson's high bar routines were not scored as they had expected.  This caused these two gymnasts to change routines they had practiced for a year with, having competed in World's a year ago with, two days before the Olympics.  As a result, Gatson fumbled during the changed part in his routine and Blaine went down HARD on the release move he added to make up the slack, whacking the back of his head on the mat.  While he got back on the bar, finished the routine and stuck the landing, and then competed in floor (which he smoked), when he got off the podium, he complained of dizziness (no kiddin'?!) and was pulled from pommel.    It's still on now, so I don't know how all this will play out tonight, but let's talk about Blaine's career here.  He tore his biceps not all that long ago, only barely back to form for the Olympics.  He has gone through amazing personal tragedy, and was hoping for one last shot at Olympic Gold.  However, with his dismal score on the high bar, he is out of the running for the individual all-around as well as the high bar.    You can't fault the coaches -- These were established, competed and scored routines.  But should we fault the judge or the scoring code that seems to change as often as I change my shorts?  Regardless of where to lay the blame, I feel for Blaine and Jayson and hope they do the best with what they are given there in Athens.

      Kerry Wood had an outstanding game today to beat the Dodgers 2-0 after a dismal start his last time out, where he went more than six innings without a single strikeout, his first time ever going a game without a K.  He had seven strikeouts in eight innings; not his best showing statistically, but he had some super-nasty stuff out there today.  As well, he went yard for the Cubs' first run, the only run they'd ultimately need.     On the other hand, Aramis Ramirez didn't play today because of that groin that keeps showing up just as things seem to be settling in.  He's day-to-day.  Hollandsworth should be ready to come off the bench going into the home stretch and Garciaparra is really settling in.  If this is the real start to Cubs' pitching coming back online, punctuated by Remlinger's stint as a closer today (Remlinger?  A closer?  Whoddathunkit?!) while we await JoBo's return or LaTroy actually doing what he was brought over to do, then we should finish the season solidly.    I believe...  Because you gotta believe!

      I was recently derided for not talking more about scuba other than my first day blogging and references to the sport or hobby or whatever sort of fun you call it, though it's part of my title.  But when you haven't been diving in a year plus and won't be going any time soon because I'm trying to get financially sound again after my 14 month layoff, you don't have much to talk about that's current.  Then I recall that, for many of you, anything I talk about will be new.  So, let's start with my last dive.     My last dive on my last dive trip was down at the South end of Cozumel.  We'd gone down to Devil's Throat and we successfully dived it for my first time in two tries.  The first time, we had someone on our boat who called himself an "advanced" diver (he did have an advanced card), but he'd never dived in salt water, with current, or any deeper than 75ft.  We got down to the entrance and the idiot had about 1500psi left when you don't want to venture into the Throat with less than 2000psi.  Yup, thanks for playing.    But I digress (and get used to it).  So, we did the Throat, and with it being the end of a week of diving as well as quite the depth for a good period of time, we took our sweet time ascending at the end of that dive.  Even with the off-gas ascent and a decent surface interval, by the time we got to our next site, Maracaibo, we knew we had to plan a dive and dive a plan else we'd all have our 'puters screaming "Deco" in that silence of the depths sort of way.  We planned to keep it above 70ft, but as soon as we hit the water above that pristine reef, we were greeted by my all-time favorite sea animal: The turtle.  Yertle was accomodating and didn't make for the bottom, so I was able to swim along with my buddy for quite a while.  However, other folks decided to go a bit deeper than planned to check out a nurse shark.    I was in heaven.  I was swimming with a turtle over some of the most outstanding coral heads I've ever seen.  There were splashes of color everywhere with blanching to a minimum.  There were all sorts of fish and later Yertle's cousin came to call.  I knew it would be my last dive in a long time, so I made the most of it.    Next thing you know, people are heading for their safety stop.  Well, actually a deco stop thrown in, not for good measure, but because they were told to do so by their computers.  I check my air and I've got a good 900psi left, and the boat's right there, so it's not like I have to have a good amount in reserve before heading up.  Not wanting to be left behind, I head up to 25ft or so to hang out with them as they expire deco time and the three-minute safety stop, but they start dropping, or should I say rising, like flies.  Up to the boat they go.    Fortunately, there was one diver and the divemaster left.  I started "talking" to Rumpy (Danny's nickname, but I was told not to ask how he got it) as we hung there.  He told me he was in deco (he'd started the race down to the nurse shark) and had about 5 minutes.  So we hung there, made faces at each other, "talked" about how I had borrowed my dad's backup 'puter when mine started flashing "low battery" right before hopping in at Devil's Throat.  We 'shamboed for a while (that's rock/paper/scissors to other folks) and laughed our butts off watching the divemaster disrobe, floating all his gear above him, tucked into a neat ball contained by the cumberbund of his BC, teathered by the regulator clutched in his mouth.     I forget what my bottom time was that dive (I suppose I could look it up), but it was absolutely the best air consumption I've ever had.  I still think about it and my blood pressure mellows out.  It is among my favorite dives ever, but it's the ideal last dive to get me through this drought.

      Watching the Olympic Opening Ceremonies, something struck me during the announcement of the U.S. team, then was forged solid with the announcement of the Cypriots: Whistles in most countries are signs of disapproval, not the equivalent of applause.  However, Katie Couric remarked that the Cypriots received the second "warmest" reception thus far, behind the United States.  I luv ya', Katie, but that wasn't warm; that was scathing.     Again, this goes to our total lack of understanding of foreign culture.  First, the struggle between Turkey and Greece over Cyprus is long-standing and bitter.  The island is virtually halved between these two cultures, neither of which actually want to claim it as its own, but both of whom are more than willing to add gas to the fire.  As well, Greece has been a bit put off by the U.S. since our backing of a junta in the late 1960s or early 1970s, spawning the ELA (see an earlier post about Greece setting free accused terrorists).  Couple that with the current international stage and you see where I'm going with this.    While Greeks are welcoming of Americans, they are not welcoming of America.  How many of the fans in the stadium for the Opening Ceremonies separate the U.S. Olympic Team from the U.S. government?  Probably few, especially when you consider that, for most countries, the Olympic effort is a governmentally-coordinated effort.    We here in the U.S. and many other countries boo to express our displeasure, while we clap and holler and whistle to show approval and support.  In many other countries around the world, it's the other way around.  It's yet another showing of ignorance of the U.S. around other cultures, along with clouding the meanings of the signal for "come here" and the OK sign across international borders.  Heck, in Wrigley, what sounds like boos to the non-Cubs fan, is actually a shower of "Alou"s.  You just can't go off the general impression of a noise to determine the meaning and emotion behind it.    I do have to admit, in the interest of fairness, that I don't know the motivation behind the noise-making during the Parade of Nations.  They could well have been showing their support.  It could well have been Greeks showing their support of the Cypriots as a whole, Greek and Turkish alike.  They could also have been really excited about the cadre of athletes who would take home a load of medals, regardless of their government's foreign policy.    Then again, it could be raining pigs this very minute.

      In sad news, Julia Child passed away in her sleep last night, according to the Reuters story  urlLink Late Cooking Diva Julia Child Loved Red Meat, Gin .  While I'll always remember her shows on PBS and guest appearances nearly everywhere, the memory that immediately sprung to mind was Dan Aykroyd's version of her on SNL back when it was good.  Is that wrong?    It is what I remember.  Her cooking, sampling the wine, then the send-up of her cutting off her hand, but continuing to provide her cooking insight as she squirted blood all over the stage.  I wish I could find a link to at least the script, but I can't seem to find anything.  Aykroyd's a genius, but so was Julia.    This is what I love about this, though.  Here she was, 91 years young, still making appearances on other chefs' shows, drinking gin, eating steak, lopping as much butter into a dish as the knife could handle.  Forget diets -- You want to live long, just eat like Julia.  And have as much fun as she seemed to have in the kitchen.

      The governor of New Jersey resigned today, stating he'd had a gay, extramarital affair that would affect his ability to govern (it's all over the news -- get your own link!).  I'm sure that's at least in part due to his having come out (pun intended) against gay marriage earlier this year.  However, it was cited that the object of his tryst being a state employee (who's filing charges) was the main reason.  So, how come he has to resign even if he admitted it when he was confronted with it when the former POTUS, who denied it and denied it until it just wouldn't go away, didn't?   There is something else to consider here.  That is that McGreevey was under other sorts of pressure during his two-and-a-half-year tenure.  He has had appointments and hirings overturned.  Contributors to his campaign are falling like flies.  Though he has never been accused of any wrongdoing.  This could well be the straw that broke the camel's back, and in the interest of trying to protect the office for future Democrats, he steps down so the next election won't be for a while after his successor is in office and the memory of McGreevey is covered in dust.  Clinton didn't have to think about that or, if he did, he figured it was of no consequence that he'd disgraced the presidency or simply didn't care.    Having been raised Catholic, there's a part of this story that makes me sad and a part that makes me chuckle; and they are both the same part.  That this man, a practicing Catholic, outspoken against gay rights, married and had children (as all good Catholics are supposed to) regardless of his lack of understanding and acceptance of himself for who he is.  I won't get into the psychobabble here, but it's a well-known pattern: Participating in activities opposed to your true lifestyle.  But throwing in the Catholic Church just for good measure adds that much more to the equation.  You have priests molesting children, a high percentage of gays in the priesthood because way back when it was the thing to do, women who can't serve in any real capacity in the Church, the exclusion of married men from becoming ordained priests, and you can't find a guy to say mass if you need one.  But don't get me started.      If only you knew the number of gays in office, happily married with a kid or two to balance out the photograph.  There are, and have been, more than you know.

      Very glad, let me tell you.  I used to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers' Management Consulting Services, later PwC Consulting and, for a brief moment, Monday and did a tour of duty at the training center in scenic Trampa.  I was there for one skirting hurricane back in 2000 (so now I just need an earthquake and I'll have all my natural disasters covered).  Were it more serious, as it looks like Charley's gonna be, I would have had to evacuate from the low-lying area right there by the airport.     Hurricanes are interesting beasts.  I'm a student of weather as well -- A family of pilots and sailors while living in Chicago will do that to you.  They are fickle wanderers of the sea, those hurricanes, teasing some while torturing others.  They bring the sea to its fullest force and compliment the howling wind with sheets of rain.  Then, just when you think you can't take any more, the eye passes over and you remember how wonderful weather can be.  Then, as though to remind you that you are merely man, the storm's fury takes over once again, that oasis obliterated by a wall of weather.    While I'd never live there, I had some fun in Tampa for the few times I was there.  They showed a Clearwater restaurant that's right on the beach -- Right on the beach -- on the news tonight and I'll be damned if I can't remember that name!  (Freddy's, Someone's, I can't remember)  I tasted a friend's conch sandwich, had some good calamari, all while sitting out on the porch that faces the beach, hearing the crash of the waves on the shore with moonlight filtered through a cloud playing on the waves.  Too bad I was with a couple of dorks at the time!  But on the news, they showed the tables being carried inside (watch the doorjamb, buddy!) and windows being boarded up.  Hope it holds up OK, as well as all my favorite establishments.  It can do what it wishes with Mons Venus.    But nothing is beyond humor in my book, so let's have some fun with the sudden fury with which the hurricane season has hit.  Newscasters everywhere were covering the two hurricanes to lambaste Florida in a span of days.  But what were their names?  I kept hearing those newscasters stumbling to remember what those names were.  Bonnie and Charley...  Bonnie Prince Charley?  Not a bad mnemonic.  And the first one of the season, the one that skirted along the Atlantic coast was named Alex.  They are supposed to alternate boy names and girl names, switching who starts off the fun each year.  But it looks like the chics are beating up on the Atlantic this year.  Alex and Charley both, especially with that spelling, could be girls.  And in an effort to "internationalise" the names of hurricanes (I mean, they are world travelers!), we could see Gaston (but not Belle this year), Otto ("a$$4o1e!"), Karl (someone from Russia Otto read once), and Walter ("you old sonofabitch").  Were they going intercultural or just back to the movies?  Besides, can you imagine if we have a busy season and in November they're reporting about "Walter bearing down on the East Coast of Florida?"  Dude, that's just an average winter in Florida (and Arkansas and Arizona).      Best of luck to all in his/her/its path.

      At the bottom of  urlLink this Reuters story  about a couple of sprinters who were injured in a motorcycle accident in Greece is the recap of the Iraq-Portugal soccer prelim in which the Iraqis won by a score of 4-2.     Sounds like it was a heated match.  I wonder if the Iraqis remember Uday isn't there to torture them when the return unvictorious?  I can imagine it was heated, though.  Portugal actually has a fairly competitive team.  Here's hoping continued success of the new Iraqi Olympic Program!

      The IOC has asked Beijing, host of the next Olympic Games, to slow down their construction progress according to the AP story  urlLink IOC Tells Beijing to Slow Games Building  .  I'm guessing because they enjoyed all the press around Greece's late completion or they are planning on canceling the games altogether.     As a project management professional, this gets my goat, as it were.  They have a plan and are working towards it.  That plan is aggressive, charting completion a year early.  But it's also well thought out.  Of course, this is driven by the almighty dollar, as usual.  But I have to wonder if they considered the cost of slowing down, both operationally and the ability to test facilities, when they decided this slowdown was necessary to save costs.  Watch: They'd have saved $1.2MM, but spent $1.5MM to achieve those one-time savings.    Here's hoping they know what they are doing!

      Were I still a kid, I wouldn't care that I have a cold.  With the proper motivation, say my brother opening up the Mastermind box, I'd be out from under the blankie, having a ball, until I heard Mom coming, at which point I'd slump a little in my chair and grunt when she asked how I was feeling.  Now, there's no one to slump for, but if there were, I wouldn't even be acting.     I wish I had the energy to post my thoughts about Porter Goss' nomination for DCI -- The good (his experience), the bad (his political affiliation), and the ugly(the confirmation hearings and the fallout).  I wish I had the energy to dump on The Dave Matthews Band for emptying their holding tanks of their tour buses over the Chicago River... by way of the Chicago Architectural Boat Tour and its passengers.  I wish I had the energy to write about the USA Women's Soccer win over Greece today.    What's sad is that when I have the energy (or time) to do more blogging, these fun topics will be out-of-date.  Anyone know how to e-mail chicken soup?  Or a new set of watercolors and coloring book from Walgreens'?

      ...but not altogether unrelated.  Yet in their own right, not worthy of two separate posts.  The Hubble Space Telescope is busted and people in non-thinking jobs might be setting themselves up for Alzheimer's.  Science at its best and worst all at the same moment.     Let's start with Hubble.  I love Hubble.  It makes really cool images and I'm bummed that I never ran across a dwarf irregular galaxy in my survey (abstract published in a German astrophysics rag) that had been captured in a Hubble file.  But in a report from  Reuters,  urlLink Hubble Telescope Instrument Out of Order - NASA , it's busted.  What's even sadder is that NASA has planned to let it die a slow and painful death because of the Shuttle issues and new telescopes that are planned for orbit soon.  NASA is putting all their eggs in one basket while refusing to put any in the same basket.  Lemme 'splain.  They are looking to launched telescopes to be 100% functional, on their own, sometime after they are put into orbit.  However, there's no reason to believe these new telescopes won't have the same issues Hubble did when it first went up.  And were it not for the STS, there would be no outstanding images today from Hubble.  What has busted on Hubble is a five-year lifespan part, a spectrometer, that has worked more than two years past its expected lifespan.  A spectrometer is key in analysis for a space-based telescope because it can provide accurate assessment of what elements are present, namely what type of emissions are being produced.  For my part, spectral analysis would have been the next step in my astronomical investigations, had I continued with that research.  Hubble should not go away, nor should the STS.    On to the next bit of suspect science.  Reuters is also reporting that,  urlLink Jobs with Little Mental Challenge May Up Alzheimer's .  The immediate argument to come to mind, pro or con, would be Ronald Reagan.  Surely one cannot argue that being a sportscaster, actor, spokesman, governor of a big state, and President of the United States represents a life of wasted thought cycles.  The researcher suggests crossword puzzles or chess for those afflicted with not-so-thought-provoking jobs.  Well, either I'm screwed or benefited by my 14-month-long layoff.  I did little intelligent work, but did a bunch of crosswords and other problems solving.    Here's the fun thing about most science: Wait long enough and another study or better tool will come along that will disprove most of what has already been said.  Here's hoping this torturous, yet fun, cycle does not end!

      My first historic memory happened thirty years ago tonight.  While I have many memories from as much as two years or more before this one, the announcement that Nixon was resigning the Presidency of the United States is the first one that is historic in nature.  I can tell you where I was and with whom, and while I didn't understand it at the time, it's a period that has haunted me and about which I've studied as I've grown.  And for many reasons, I believe the Nixon presidency has shaped me at least as much as the Reagan era, even though I was hardly a sentient being for Nixon's time in politics.     This memory was spawned by C-Span2 rerunning a  Booknotes  episode (two, actually) with Nixon as he released  Seize the Moment: America's Challenge in a One-Superpower World  from February of 1992.  For all the studying I've done of Nixon, his administration, and his downfall, I've forgotten far more than I remember.    Nixon was a visionary geo-politician.  Including what he did to begin relations with China at a time that was most advantageous to the U.S. (as opposed to waiting until they were in a position to negotiate), he had a strong grasp of what was going on in the world in 1992 and much of that is applicable today.  He discussed why the U.S. was the sole world power, that no other country was in the position to do so after WWII or now with the collapse of the Soviet Union.  As well, he specifically called out that Germany is in the interesting position of neither wanting to accept the responsibility as a world leader while being handcuffed by their neighbors' memories not allowing them to step into the spotlight again.    So many of his ideas in this book, expressed in this interview, should be looked at again today.  The key one, in my opinion, is that the U.S. is responsible for the world economy because it is so closely tied to the U.S. economy.  He reminded us that the recession of the late 1920s became the Great Depression because of the highly-isolationist approach of the Hawley-Smoot tariff act.  Tariffs of as much as 60% all but shut down international trade with the U.S. as the affected countries struck back with tariffs of their own.  For students out there who read my stuff and think I'm Republican through and through, though I decry any blind allegiance to a party as often as possible, the sponsors of this act were Republicans.  If you're wrong, it doesn't matter what party you're with for me!  To extend that to the foreign policy that grew from the time of Nixon's interview through now, I believe Clinton's administration took this to mean that we are responsible for any country around the world.  This is not at all what Nixon intended or practiced.  He was interested in protected the U.S. interests and future, wherever it was threatened.  He tried for a tenable solution in Indo-China because of the position of strength it would put the Chinese in across from the country that shares the bulk of international trade with the U.S.: Japan.  Bush now goes after the Middle East not because of oil as the liberals would proclaim, but rather because of how the instability of the Middle East affects our ability to work internationally.  Without an Israeli-Palestinian solution, Middle East countries will continue their isolationist ways, putting the U.S. and other countries at a disadvantage negotiating solutions world-wide.  It's the same principle as Nixon took to China: Negotiate with them while you are in the stronger position rather than in a reaction to their stance of strength later on.    But that is the key: That we should become involved if it is in the best interest of the U.S., implying it is in the best interest of the world economy as well.  One example from history that Nixon cited was the return of Okinawa to Japan.  We'd won it fair and square in WWII, and as internationally recognized, we had no obligation to return it.  But it wasn't in the U.S. interest to hold Okinawa -- It was of no tactical nor strategic advantage to the U.S. to remain in U.S. control.  So why, again, should we consider going into places that are of no strategic advantage to the U.S. and the world economy, such as Bosnia, East Africa, and as is now being advocated, Sudan?  They are of no strategic import to the U.S. or international strategy.  We shouldn't have been, nor should we be, involved.    Nixon also preached, if you will, a person's need to learn as much as they can.  He was an avid reader and a world traveler.  In fact, he said he was better served by his loss to Kennedy in 1960 because it afforded him the time to travel the world and better understand our place in it.  I'm always ashamed at how little Americans as a whole know about the world at large, of which we are a small, but significant, part.  This is something I have adopted without having known Nixon to be such an advocate.    And for all his reasonableness in the face of how he left the White House, he still knew how to throw liberals a serious shot.  He went on about how a more socialist approach (cradle-to-grave welfare and artificial trade restrictions, for example) would be the downfall of the U.S. as a whole.  That "People only compete when they have to," so if the government beat that competitive nature out of people on the most basic levels of existence and trade, the growth of the U.S. would cease.  As well, he brought up the idea that academia is so liberal-minded that "fortunately" some folks come out of their education so averse to the "brain-washing" that took place that they turn entirely to the other side of the spectrum: Conservativism.  His concern at the time was that, as a result of the narrow approach to education for the most part, the U.S. would become a declining world power because we fail to cover the real world as it exists.  He showed pride in never having taken a PoliSci class; he learned more about Political Science by living it, not reading about it.    I also forgot how he came upon the national stage.  First, he was on the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) during his freshman term in Congress.  What a way to start!  As well, he was both the victim and beneficiary of the political process going high-tech, having "lost" the debate with Kennedy solely because it was televised as well as using it better than any president before to get his message across.    Something else I'd forgotten what that in 1985 or so, he release the Secret Service obligation to protect him.  He did still accept the presidential stipend for an office and a modest staff of four, but in true Republican fashion, he dispensed with this expense, saving the country over $25MM through the time of his death in Protection expenses.    To that same end, he argued that current administrations, even his own for that matter, were far larger than they should be.  Not only was he interested in the expense and general size of government, but he also stressed that it's far too easy to let a staffer handle something rather than a president fully understanding the scope of a question at hand.  This is a lesson I chose to put aside to some degree for the 2000 election.  I quite preferred the people around Bush over the single-handedness of Gore.  While I don't think this directly applies -- Nixon was talking about the depth of staffers rather than the breadth of advisers -- it is still an important lesson to remember.    And from the "those who fail to learn history are doomed to repeat it" file, Nixon talked about what he least enjoyed about his staff, citing his foreign service advisers.  He said they didn't necessarily get it wrong, per se, rather they'd gone after "style over substance" in finessing the true international state and impact of policy decisions.  Deja vu all over again with the Bush administration, eh?   I'd also forgotten Nixon's love of sport.  In fact, he said of all the professions out there, what he would love to be most is a sportscaster.  He was intrigued by the strategy and the intricacy of the play.  As well, he declared, "Politics is the greatest sport there is," having said his participation in politics almost made up for his lack of skill in athletic sport.  And for these two reasons together, he believed that the transition from sportscaster to journalist or historian made perfect sense.    As most will remember tomorrow as the anniversary of Nixon's resignation, accompanied by that famous shot of his boarding Marine One with that broad wave, I remember tonight as my first introduction into the wonderful world of politics.  It's a shame that still, today, thirty years later, one is more willing to say Reagan influenced their current political stance than to cite Nixon's strong geo-political approach as forming the foundation to a reasonable approach to U.S. politics.

      The Chalabis have been charged in Iraq with various crimes including forgery and murder, according to the Reuters report,  urlLink Iraq Issues Warrants Against Chalabi, Nephew .  The Chalabis have always had their own agenda, and I still can't believe we ever relied on their information about Iraq in true decision-making or, for that matter, invited the patriarch as a guest to the State of the Union Address this year.     I'm just glad we saw through Ahmad's facade before we appointed him to any key position in the Iraqi government; he was another Saddam waiting to happen.  The family ties, the tribal support, and the desire to manipulate the wealth of a country to his own benefit put him in the same shoes as Saddam.  The only difference is that Chalabi for some time had the support of the U.S.  Wait...  That's not right...  So did Saddam, at one point or another anyway.    I can't wait to hear the details of the charges and any follow-up charges and arrests to come.  This should be quite interesting to see the Iraqi government moving to quell any graft that might influence the free elections to happen next year.  They are doing exactly what is right for Iraq in the long-term, throwing short-term consequences to the wind.    What makes this even funnier is that the cousin who's being charged is the same one that heads up the tribunal that is trying Saddam.  I thought from the first moment that he was announced that that was a bit of the fox guarding the hen house.    Here's what I'd love to see: Saddam and the Chalabis enjoying a muffin together in shackles waiting for their moments in front of an Iraqi judge who's not a Chalabi.

      Reuters' London office is reporting that the owner of that laptop from which the information was gathered that prompted the address-specific terror threat level hike had been working to snare other al-Qaeda operatives when his name was released by the press.  The story,  urlLink Unmasking of Qaeda mole a security blunder , says Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan had been captured in July, but had continued contact with other al-Qaeda members in cooperation with Pakistani intelligence.  That is until he was outed last weekend in the rush by the press to spin the anti-terror activity as orchestrated events by the Bush Administration.     As with most intelligence operations, secrecy is vital.  Sources are undercover for a reason: Without them, you have no human intelligence.  However, harping about the age of the information and whether there was an attack pending pushed the U.S. to say there was a source in custody.  That was bad enough.  Then the  NY Times  dug around until they found out who it was, releasing the name regardless of the consequences to ongoing operations.    There is a constant collision in times of war between the freedom of the press, the right of the American people to know what all's going on, and the long-term safety and freedom of the U.S. as a whole.  Unfortunately, too many journalists and media outlets have lost sight of that.  And this is not necessarily a left/right issue; let me simply say Geraldo Rivera to show any journalist can be stupid.    As a result of the Khan leak, the U.K. had to push up operations to take into custody many operatives, though they had had them under surveilance to hopefully cast a wider net.  Instead, we have who we have and only who we have in custody, and will have to spend some serious time or fall upon some serious luck to gain the intelligence position we had until last weekend.    Here's what gets me the most: The people who pushed the hands of the intelligence communities in the U.S. and U.K. to round up all these people are the same ones who say that this round-up was orchestrated to put the Republican party back in the spotlight after the DNC.  Come on, now.  You can't have your cake and eat it, too.  The press, namely the  NY Times  outed a source in a similar fashion to the outing of Ambassador Wilson's wife, undermining ongoing operations directly tied to the security of the United States.  How come no one is crying foul?

      From the get go, these accusations that the Pakistanis and others are catching people to help the Bush reelection attempt have chapped my ass.  Almost to prove how silly an idea this is, a big al-Qaeda player arrested and put into Pakistani custody today.     Going back to the capture of Saddam, even, people said he'd been caught long before the time it was announced, but was announced to offset bad economic news.  Well, it did kinda work, I suppose, because I don't remember what that particular news happened to be (or maybe it was the upswing in Democratic candidate activity).  However, I think members of the Fourth Estate would argue that their being pressed into work on their day off, a notoriously slow news day, Sunday, shows that it was clearly no orchestrated as some said.    But the interesting thing to note is that the cycle in the Middle East in general does not follow the Monday thru Friday pattern of the Western World.  Their day of rest is either Friday or Saturday (Israel being included in the Middle East as it is), with their work week starting on Sunday.   The guy handed over today to Pakistan from Dubai happens to be a close friend of Osama himself and is believed to be behind the attempts on Gen. Musharraf's life.  They have also captured someone who has headed up the insurgency in Kashmir who also had ties to the Afghani Taliban and al-Qaeda.  Today.  Saturday.    So, when they catch someone, whether it is timed after the Convention (and believe me, a day or a week after the Convention wouldn't have mattered -- The same folks would have argued that it was orchestrated to pop the post-Convention bubble) or timed in the middle of a weekend, these are targets of opportunity and cannot be orchestrated.    On a bit of a tangent, it is clear that Iraq has absolutely no interest in doing things that make the U.S. look good in the region.  This was evident today in Iraq moving to close the  al-Jazeera  office in Baghdad.  This does not look good for the U.S. for a couple of reasons.  To start, the suppression of free speech is highly un-American.  Secondly, if for nothing else, they are a voice to the Middle East and even if they are reporting an anti-American stance, at least they are reporting what goes on in Iraq.  Were Iraq being manipulated by the U.S., I can't believe this would have been sanctioned.    So, again and always, here's hoping they catch Osama on a weekday during October.  ;)

      Being as male as a female can get with the remote control, I was flipping channel after channel during simultaneous commercials in all four shows I was watching at the time when I came across something quite ugly.  It's all in the timing.     I stumbled across a news channel (I wanna say it was CNN Headline News) showing the video of the Cardinals' running back, Marcel Shipp, and the play in which he broke his leg.  It wasn't quite Theisman, but it wasn't pretty either; He was kinda on top of a pile, his body pointing one way while his foot pointed a whole other way.  I don't know if they warned those who were watching when they cut to the video, but I sure hope so!  Shocked, I muttered my signature "'At's gonna leave a mark."  In the spirit of Joe Theisman, I have to say I'm no Norman Einstein, but I've learned my lesson: Be prepared when surfing.

      Greg Maddux earned his 300th career win today in an 8-4 win over the Giants in San Francisco.  While this wasn't a classic Maddux win today, that's exactly what has gotten him to 300 wins: The ability to win with the stuff you have that day.     Maddux is such a student of the game, and now an outstanding teacher for the young rotation of the Cubs; you'd have loved to have seen what the season could have brought had the starting rotation been in place more of the season.  He left today's game in the sixth, promptly heading to the clubhouse with the lead without taking any bows.  See, he hadn't won it yet, and he had to make sure his bullpen knew it.    Huge in today's game was run support; something the Cubs have been sorely lacking of late.  Aramis quietly plated another run; one of five cubs with RBIs today.  While Nomar was one of the two Cubs you'd expect to plate runs who didn't (Sammy being the other), Nomar spent more time on the basepaths than any other Cub, going 3 for 5 and twice crossing the plate.  And Mo got his 10th career dinger against his dad.    Now, don't get me started about Sammy.  I'm not his biggest fan, nor ever have been.  But I've gotta ask this question: If everybody and their brother knows he's too far off the plate and trying to pull everything when what has served him best over his career is going the other way, why can't the Sarge fix his approach to hitting?  It's been more than a year since he took one in his earhole, yet everyone is saying that's what's pushing him off the plate.  This is a relatively new thing -- He started the season (prior to the sneezing fit) diving to the ball.  Besides, I would think that having had pulled muscles from sneezing that he'd be more comfy closer to the plate and would be more likely to move his whole body in to dive at the ball rather than throw the arms at it.  But what do I know?  All I can do is consistently ground out to short.    So, now with that out of the way, we can worry about charging to win the Central.  Even if we don't, if that's our target, we'll surely clinch the Wild Card spot.

      But it's not because she's currently the best athlete for the job; it's because those who did qualify are being excluded from participating in the Olympics by the USADA for using banned substances.  In a report from AP today,  urlLink U.S. Sprinter May Miss Olympics , it is reported that Torri Edwards will not be allowed to participate in the Olympics, opening up a spot for Marion Jones to slide into and defend her 2000 gold medal.  U.S. Athletics supporter (pun intended) or not, I feel this has gotten entirely out of hand.     First, I do believe that any country that is made to bar a participant who qualified for the Olympics from competing in those Olympics because of doping should lose that qualification spot, rather than be able to plug in a substitute as you would for an injured athlete.  Clearly, if Jones couldn't qualify on her own merits during the Trials, she shouldn't be carrying the flag to Athens.    And that's not even counting in the fact that Jones could well show up on this team and jeopardize the ability for the team to keep their medals, were they to win any, when they find she's violated the banned substance policy.  There are already a number of individual and relay medals that are at risk from prior Olympics.  Were this to continue, it would be that much longer before the spectre of doping is lifted from shadowing the U.S. Track and Field Team.    In a related story, Greece just tempted the gods by declaring Greece "the most secure country in the world."  The deputy defense minister went on to say in a story by Reuters,  urlLink Greece Sees No Threats for Athens Olympics , that  "We have no feeling that we are threatened by anyone."   Excellent.  Our athletes and the future of amateur sport are being protected by graduates of the Ostrich School of Management.    Opening ceremonies are on Friday and I've never been so nervous.  And it's not like I'm going to be there.  Atlanta was marred by the park pipe bomb at a time that domestic terrorism was a minor concern comprising a bunch of militia crackpots.  The only fortunate thing here, if one can see it that way, is that Greece has been dealing, albeit quite unsuccessfully, with domestic terrorism from the ELA for decades.  Maybe they do have a handle on this.  From my fingers to God's eyes, as it were.

      Seems Tom Brokaw has himself a stalker, according to  E! Online's  report  urlLink Tom Brokaw Terrorized .  Only a bit of an indictment has been released, but it's the stuff of Stephen King.     According to the article, the veteran NBC News anchor has received over 3,500 anonymous (well, they were intended to be anonymous, anyway) e-mails over the past two months from this kook, including threats to do harm.  I can't find time to send 35 e-mails in two months, much less 3,500!!!    Oh, yeah.  But the kook and Brokaw are buddies, doncha know.  Yeah, that's just what normal buddies do: Send zillions of annoying and threatening e-mails, forcing the buddy to file charges.    To hear his response continue, he had issues around the Jonestown Massacre (what?  Was he there?), the assassinations of the Kennedys and MLK, and   An allegedly crooked, Georgia-based kitchen installation company that he swears is trying to shake him down for cash.   Reality is such a touchy subject.  And he goes on to state that Brokaw is pressing charges to "help" him even after he claims to have told MSNBC (why not NBC, I don't know) that he wouldn't have done anything he threatened in the notes.    Well, at least Tom will have something to do in his retirement: Court proceedings on the pending felony charges.    I hear stuff like this and can understand how those in the public spotlight would rather not find themselves in this sort of situation.  After the Anthrax threats against not only the Congress, but the Fourth Estate as well, how one has to be very careful about assessing threats.  It's too bad that many of those folks are forced to keep true fans at arm's length, but clearly necessary.

      So I read in the  NY Times  this morning (I'd link, but unless you subscribe, it's no use) that al-Sadr incited this riot today in Iraq, prompting his followers to rise up against the Americans.  Then, at midnight prevailing local time, after a day of fighting and death, he's backed off.  Why, pray tell, is this guy still walking this earth, a free man with a loud voice?     At the very least, he's guilty of inciting riots many times over.  At the very worst, he's guilty of conspiracy to murder Federal employees (I admittedly don't know if that holds any water in a foreign land).  Yet, here he is, rearing his ugly head and hateful mouth again.  And this is after a cease-fire had been maintained for months.  And now he wants another one.  And we'll grant it, because that's what we do.  But I really think we should tell him to go pound sand with that first cease-fire he violated and stay engaged until he surrenders.    He started this two weeks ahead of a political conference he refuses to attend.  Clearly, his intentions are not to be part of the political process, but rather to manipulate it however he can to gain a stronger position in national politics than he deserves.    Until these insurgents can be taken down -- Until their leaders can be taken down -- We will continue to suffer these unprovoked attacks.  Somebody do something, already!

      This is sooooo cool!  I love the Harry Potter series of books, have thoroughly enjoyed the movies, love seeing Alan Rickman as Snape, miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore, but like Michael Gambon's Dumbledore just as well.  Now, to add to the outstanding cast that keeps growing movie by movie, Ralph Fiennes will play Voldemort in the next movie, as reported by  E! Online  in  urlLink One Fiennes Day for "Potter" .    To look at Ralph Fiennes, you wouldn't think he'd play a villain so well, but after characters like Goeth in  Schindler's List  and The Count in  The English Patient , it was hard to get around his character in  Maid in Manhattan , assuming you were able to stay awake for more than moments of the film.  To hear he's playing Voldemort warms my soul!  He is such a great villain in general, but will add to the Tom Marvolo Riddle riddle: How a boy so skilled and liked could become the master of the Dark Arts.  Fiennes' characters can be so "normal" looking, yet so deeply evil, it's fun to think of what he'd bring to this role.    I can't wait for the next film Christmastime 2005, nor can I wait for the next book!!!

      A guy was arrested for DUI over a year ago in Pennsylvania.  He finally went to a hearing (after fighting the charge by saying the police had no probable cause to pull him over as he was driving safely, says he).  The judge had to stop the proceedings and have a field sobriety test administered to the defendant.  Pending a blood test, the defendant will be placed in contempt of court for showing up drunk, as reported by AP in  urlLink DUI Defendant Comes to Court Drunk .     This is hysterical to think that some guy with three times the legal BAC to drive shows up to court to argue his innocence.  It's also tremendously sad to think that, if he's so bold as to show up in front of a judge who holds you future in your hands, he's likely to have been driving this past year, suspended license or not.  And when his license is revoked, clearly the thought will easily cross his mind to go for a ride.  I'm afraid for the people of PA.    I understand it's an illness.  I really do.  But if these people, repeat offenders and scofflaws, can't find a way to get treatment and stay sober, someone else has to step in, and I hope there's legal reform soon to keep these from making stupid choices and protect innocent people on the road.

      Especially when it's headed up by the wife of the candidate.  Not only did Teresa Heinz Kerry heckle back (in light blue tone as well) at a protester yesterday, but John Kerry today accused the president of having squandered a booming economy.     Mrs. Kerry's outburst, full of hate and fear-mongering, is cited in AP's story  urlLink Heinz Kerry: Three More Months for Bush .  While Bush supporters were chanting "Four More Years" she quipped, "They want four more years of hell."  Yes, she's outspoken.  Yes, hecklers deserve a dose of their own medicine.  But to call the past four years hell and make people believe they have four years of their personal ring of the Inferno to inhabit is definitely not in the spirit of constructive debate to which the Democratic Party challenged the Republicans just a few short days ago.    In that same vein, Kerry today said Bush tanked the economy, as cited in  Reuters  story  urlLink Kerry Accuses Bush of Squandering Robust Economy .  First, clearly the Democrats are forgetting that the downturn in the economy is charted as having begun in early 2000, not after the elections in November or the inauguration in January of 2001.  It happened on Clinton's watch as the DotCom bubble burst.    As well, he's bringing up changing the law of the land so that the president himself can veto spending lines of the budget.  Hmmm...  Line Item Veto for the president.  Sounds familiar...  Oh, that's right.  Clinton tried it and was denied by the SCOTUS.  Bush started talk about it this year, and his aides now say they've come to a solution that they think will pass muster with the Courts.  At least you can't say Kerry flip-flopped there -- He voted for the Line Item Veto in 1996.  He's just stealing Bush's work towards passage, mostly because you haven't heard much about it in the news.    So when can I expect a civil campaign tongue by those who preemptively called the other side on the carpet for dirty campaigning?    You know, reading my posts of the last week or so, my partisanship is showing, what little of it there really is.  But it's not the Democratic platform that I abhor -- In fact, there are many planks on which I stand.  I can't stand lying and manipulating.

      Well, I learned that I know one rather well, where I know nearly nothing of the other.  And the gap that I closed did nothing to change my opinion of that candidate, only strengthen it.  It all started yesterday, while lounging in the pool, my dad mentioned that John Kerry isn't an Irish Catholic.  Flabbergasted, he then mentioned that Kerry was, in fact, a descendent of the Forbes of international trade and railroad fame, among other things, and a relative of Steve Forbes, the former Republican presidential candidate.  So, not believing my father, I went in search of information.  Here's what I found.     I found several sources that served up nothing that was new: Yale, service record, prosecutor, senator, hockey player.  But then I came across an excellent site,  urlLink  Wikipedia  .    Looking up  urlLink John Kerry  on  Wikipedia , I found much of interest.  First, Kerry isn't Irish Catholic, as he'd have Bostoners think.  He's Hungarian-Czech on his father's side and a Bostonian raised in France on his mother's side.  She's the Forbes of Chinese opiate trade.  And through her, especially, he's related to more conservatives than he'd clearly rather name.   Kerry moved among boarding schools as a child, something with which the average Democrat can relate.  This was a function of his father's service with State, not with the Army Air Corps as Kerry would have you believe from his story-telling of travels with Dad.  He also summered in France at his mother's childhood estate.    Kerry would let you believe he became involved in politics as a result of his returning from Viet Nam, disillusioned.  Rather, he went into college with political ambition, majoring in PoliSci.  Heck, Richard Nixon and Chuck Colson spoke about him on the White House tapes as being a politico, looking for a "horse to ride" having gone to Viet Nam to have the service record and the experience, but returning to find a position as a dove who had served would serve him well.  To have Colson and Nixon, two political operatives if ever there were such, say you're a politico and an opportunist, well, it takes one to know one.    And about that military service.  He spoke out against the war in his commencement address in 1966, then proceeded to volunteer, after he was denied a 12-month deferment.  That's how they wrote it -- Leads me to believe he didn't exactly volunteer, or volunteered with the intention of not serving.  You tell me how you read that.    Kerry arrived in Viet Nam after six months of training for swift boat duty, after he had been billeted on the U.S.S. Gridley in the electrical department.  He arrived on 1 December 1968 and was promptly wounded on 2 December 1968.  That time, the piece of shrapnel was removed from his arm with tweezers and some bacitracin was applied.  That was his first Purple Heart.  Sounds quite Frank Burns-like.  His second Purple Heart was earned in February 1969 occurred after he sandbagged returning to a hot zone after refueling.  This time he took shrapnel to the leg that is still there, and he missed no duty time.  Eight days later he earned his Silver Star.  On 13 March, he rescued Jim Rassmann, who now speaks on his behalf, earning him the Bronze Star and his third Purple Heart, the ticket home.  This incident included shrapnel wounds in his left butt cheek, which were treated with bacitracin and bandaged, and some bruises.  Kerry was reassigned on St. Patrick's Day 1969 back to the States.  He served a total of four years active duty, two years in the Reserves, then six more in the Standby Reserves, only attaining his discharge in 1978.    After the famed Senate Hearings, Kerry went to law school the day after his first daughter was born.  After getting his J.D., he did what anyone with law school bills would do: Open a muffin shop.  In talking about his political ambitions, the  Boston Globe  said: "His ambition tempered only by political naivete, Kerry tried on congressional districts like suits off the rack. In less than two months in early 1972, the antiwar leader called three different districts in Massachusetts home. To this day, he bears the brand of opportunist from that brazen district-hopping, which he acknowledges as part of his political 'baggage.' "    In a Watergate-like turn of events, his own brother and a campaign field director were caught breaking into his opponent's office in September 1972, on the night before the primary (look , boys, you have to get the poop earlier than that).    After Kerry was elected to the Senate, he met with Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega, a Sandinista, supported by Cuba and heinously oppressive of the people of Nicaragua.  Needless to say, when Iran-Contra broke, he jumped aboard the opportunity to dig up poop on the opposition by conducting an investigation outside the Senate committees.    He currently serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and formerly on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he missed 38 of 49 Intel meetings in eight years.    But when I looked up  urlLink George W. Bush , I found nothing new.  Perhaps that's because he's been through the rigors of a presidential campaign, when anything and everything becomes public domain.    It's interesting how certain things come out and become the center of the campaign when you are a Republican, but certain more egregious oversights and dichotomies aren't heard of when you're a Democrat.  Just sayin'.    Get to know all you can about your candidates on your own from multiple sources.  It's your civic duty.

      ... Because of the Olympics.  In another attempt to prove their planning prowess, the Greek government has been forced by their own laws to release three accused terrorists because they recessed the trial for the month of August, reports Reuters in  urlLink Greek Guerrilla Suspects Walk Free Before Olympics .  Nice.     Greek law states a person cannot be held for more than 18 months pending a verdict, but the delay of the trial for a month has forced the Greek government to release these three murderers.  For a country that has the security of tens of thousands of athletes and fans in their hands, they really didn't look down the road all that far in preparing for the Olympics -- I have to wonder what else they missed.    I mean, at the very least you'd think you could have re-arrested them for something, anything, if you'd seen this as possibly coming up.  Let them go and pick them right back up for jaywalking for all I care, just keep them off the streets.  And there's no sort of nice generic "menace to society" sort of charge they can bring to hold them for a month?  No wonder they've been a target of domestic terrorism for decades.    What's scary about the ELA is that their charter focuses on the removal of U.S. forces from Greece.  So these three are a direct threat to our athletes and fans.  And where did I find this story?  In the international sections, of course.  Not at all in the U.S. pages.

      At 1pm CT today, Department of Homeland Security head, Tom Ridge, will hold a news conference to discuss raising the alert status from yellow to orange for NYC and DC on specific threats to financial institutions.  They are also considering raising the level for other banking centers, among which I would assume is Chicago.  This would be a perfect play for al-Qaeda if they are attempting to influence the upcoming elections here.     These targets are among the easiest to strike because of their locations.  They are generally in the center of their respective cities with easy access by vehicles.  As well, they are generally in older parts of the city, with narrower streets and buildings that come right up to the street.  Heck, here in Chicago, one of the boards of trade (I think it's the CBOE) is actually split on either side of the street, connected by a handful of storeys that span the bisecting street -- You can actually drive under part of the building.  While there are security measures that have been in place since 9/11, such as parking restrictions and constant patrols of standing vehicles, no one can deem these locations safe.    But they are also ideal targets as they serve dual purposes: To undermine the security of the U.S. while undermining the economy of the U.S. as well as the world.  The Terror Two-Fer, if you will.  If they are somehow lucky enough to pull something like this off, I think the world will change more significantly than on that fateful day in the waxing fall of 2001.  Our foreign policy would be immediately repealed, with Iraq falling into the hands of extremists once again.  Our economy would go back into the tank from which it is emerging.  We would be forced into a period of flux when the current president could be declared a lame duck and a new administration would be in its upstart phase, opening us up for more attacks.    Not only do we need to, each and every one of us as well as a country as a whole, redouble our efforts to stop terror in its tracks and keep our eyes peeled for suspicious activity, but also resolve to keep the election influenced only by the national politics of the day, not the foreign ideologies of yesteryear.
