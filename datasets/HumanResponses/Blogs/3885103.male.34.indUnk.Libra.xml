      A lot of people ask me "Why are you in film?"  And usually I say "How did you get this number?  Don't call here again!"  Seriously though, to answer that question, simple I love it.  Film is my medium.  They say the Army is the toughest job you'll ever love, I think the same thing about film.  See, a lot of folks think film is just the glitz and glamour.  Red carpets, hanging out with movie stars, the perks.  Well that's about 2% of what goes into making a movie.   Let me tell you about being a PA on a film.  You're the first person on the set, and the last one to leave.  It's a "gopher" position, but it's so much more, especially on an indie film, where everything is "do it yourself".  So while you are doing your PA duty, which basically equates to being the oil that makes the film run, you are doing other things, like helping the grips put down a dolly track, helping string lights, talking with the owner of a location to make sure you won't get kicked out, etc.  I could go on, but having lived through dozens of films, it's almost impossible to explain.    One of my first jobs was working on a movie called Above Freezing in 1997.  It was a blast, 16 hour day minimum (usually I averaged close to about 19 hours a day for that shoot), 6 day weeks.  What did I get for my efforts?  A 200 dollar a week check for 4 weeks work.  Do the math, it's not much, after taxes even less.  But you know what I also got for my hard work?  A credit: Production Assistant.  Kick ass.  So for all the bullshit I had to deal with, and the underwhelming sum of money I made (which barely paid for rent and bills at the end of the month), I have a piece of history (well not really, Above Freezing never got full release, but it did make it on HBO for a few months in 2000.  Cut to 2002, I'm a producer now, and I'm producing a TV pilot called "Waystation:Prelude" for a dude I knew from MTV (who was also directing it).  I won't go into heavy detail, but let's just say the film sucked ass.  It was hackneyed, badly written, some of the acting is even worse.  The director cast his wife in the lead role, and she had the acting ability that was akin to that of amateur porn.  Not to mention that the film was horribly produced.  Not my call really, the director also put up the funds to make the film.  Most all of the "bad moves" could have been trouble shot well before the film roled camera, but alas, the director wanted a bunch of yes man aboard who would sit around and tell him how talented he was.  Problem was, he wasn't talented at all.  Basically the film would go on, and he would sit with a blank stare near a monitor.  He didn't even call roll or cut.  I've never quite worked around somebody who had less of a concept of what a director did than this guy.  Not only that, but he had no clue on how much the film would cost, or how much work went into making it happen.  Sure he had the money, great, be an executive producer, leave the actual making of a movie to those who know what they're doing.  Anyway, the director and I had a falling out after the movie, and it still sits on a shelf somewhere with the director thinking that he's got a 100 million dollar film in his hands.  Ha ha ha ha.  Good luck Austin.  (note:  I did go out of my way AFTER we had the falling out to get the film in the hands of my friend Jen, who is a MAJOR Hollywood player.  She watched it with me and laughed the whole time, the director then lied to her and said there was a virtual feeding frenzy going on with the MAJOR studios and how she should come aboard right now before it was too much.  That shit might work for MTV, but in the real world...  Yeah, she told him he was full of shit, and I had nothing to do with it)  The cool part of that film, besides the 20 hour days, working with my g/f, and being a "producer" was that I met one of the coolest people I've had the pleasure of getting to know in the industry, my buddy Gary.  I needed an AD after I decided that I hate ADing 10 days into the shoot, so I went out and found Gary.  Gary is this really cool young producer/AD from Queens, and to be honest with you, I haven't clicked with somebody on a project like Gary did.  We both saw the problems that was going to arise BEFORE they happened.  We predicted the same things before the day started.  In other words, we were simpatico.  He's brilliant, and that's not to blow my own horn, but he really knows his shit up and down.  On top of that, he's an ace budget guy, can do AD work, knows scheduling up and down and is funny as hell.    Anyway, where is this going?  I asked Gary to be the producer of LCR last week, and he said yes.  I look at it this way, if I'm an expansion team and I'm making my first draft pick, Gary would be that pick 10 times out of 10.  With him aboard, I know that things will get done, but more importantly they will get done in a manner that is professional.  I know I could work with Gary on anything, we've already went to "war" together on a project that was a mess before either of us were ever involved.  So having him on deck right now before I'm ready to start anything is probably the best thing to happen to my project.  Plus he'll be a lot of fun to work with, this is what we both wanted in our careers, him as a producer, me as a director.  Funny how these things work out.  Dude, sweet!!!  PS:  Hope emailed me, she's going to read the script.  Here's hoping that she likes it more than the other project.  Things are moving.  No word from the casting director I want to work with, but it's understandable, this is the busy season for him.  But come on dude, I'm sooooooo jazzed to see what you could come up with.

      Finding money is a bitch.  It's probably the hardest part of the job of making a film.  I liken it to getting a root canal, only without the benefit of novacaine and you have other people involved, usually the ones doing the drilling.  You won't believe how many times I've heard "when you're ready, call me."  Well they're all BULLSHITING.  Nobody wants to throw their own money into a film.  It's a bad investment.  I'm a producer and I'll tell them it's a bad investment.  Why?  Because for every movie that you hear about, for every film that actually makes it into your cinema, there are about 20 that never saw the light of day.  They end up in various stages of disarray.  There is no one true formula for success, especially not at the indie level.  So, when that's why I tell potential investors the truth.  Mostly because they are friends of mine, and I want to be honest with them that, although I think this or that project is great, there is the very real potential that you might not get ANY of your money back.  I'm tenacious, probably to a fault.  I don't take rejection well.  Okay, scratch that, on the SURFACE I take rejection really well, but inside it sort of makes me feel that it's something that I'm doing wrong.  So I compensate and work even harder.  This is a benefit in indie film.  You go through what seems like an endless supply of "NO" just to get that single individual who says "YES".  Right now I'm working with my old fraternity brother from Purdue named Tom.  Tom rocks.  I've known him for 15 years now.  You do realize your getting older when you can date your college friends that far back.  Anyway, Tom and myself were 2 of the biggest party guys at our frat.  Like REALLY big party guys, so much so the straight-laced Hoosiers who also made up most of our frat despised us.  Some guys flat out hated us.  Why?  Mostly because we didn't really take anything in the frat seriously.  School too.  I was a film major, Tom was poly-sci, we went to a school that wasn't exactly known for their great film program and turning out poly scientists (or whatever).  So it was easy to slack.  It also didn't help that I was the "house hippy", which incidently, was not true, I just had long hair, but I was a surfer, I couldn't stand hippies.  Not that everybody hated us, just a lot of people.  Guys who were engineering majors with no sense of humor, who would call the cops on us if they smelled pot smoke, or tell us how we never take anything seriously.  Tom always had a great response to those things, one time a dude called the cops on us for smoking in the house.  We almost got into a lot of trouble, I was ready to kill this dude.  Tom did something better.  He gathered about 6 of the "stoner brothers" and went up to this dude's room.  Walked in by himself and locked the door behind him.  He then sat down next to him and told him that we were going to hunt him, and if we found him, we were going to do things to him that weren't going to be cool with him.  He then put a stopwatch on his desk with 5 minutes running down on his desk and walked out.  The guy thought he was joking, but he wasn't.  5 minutes later I was picking his lock and we were in his room.    We didn't do anything horrible to him, just completely blackened his face with a permanent marker (he had this grey hue to him for about 2 weeks), and then we handcuffed him to the Delta Gamma anchor bare ass naked while the sprinkler system went on.  Needless to say, no more calls from the cops ever came down, Tom graduated a year or two ahead of me, married a really nice Indiana gal named Buffie, took the LSAT, scored in the top 95%, went to law school, made the national law revue, and worked his way up to the point that he now owns a HUGE house in downtown Indy.  He also is a hardcore Republican, and although we might differ politically, he's still one of my oldest friends, and I love the guy to death.    I just love to give him crap about his photo of him shaking hands with Dick CHeney though.  Anyway, my path differed.  I finished at Purdue, then went to live in Texas with my then girlfriend and go to grad school.  Things didn't work out, I moved back to NY, then moved to the Hamptons where I surfed, cooked and wrote.  It was a blast.  That was ten years ago, and I don't surf (the result of a massive car accident that basically broke my back), my long hair is replaced by a shiny bald head (Bruce Willis style, thank God) but I still cook.  And write.    About 3 years ago, me and KK (my future wife) were going to Indy to visit some friends around Christmas, when I thought it would rock to see Tom and Buffie, I hadn't see him in about 10 years, but the second we hooked up we were like Jordan and Pippen on the court.  We hadn't lost a step.  Tom and I have really calmed down on the party scene, but it didn't matter.  We talked about what he did, and how he was now the campaign manager for a few top Republicans in Indiana, and how much money he raised, and how he went about doing his job.    I was enthralled by it all.  He really was doing well for himself, had aligned himself with a lot of really important people and even went to the WH Christmas Dinner that December.  Okay, I'm not a Bush fan, I always thought he reminded me of a dude who was in my fraternity.  Probably somebody I would have drank a lot with.  That being said, I wouldn't want any of my frat brothers being President.  But fuck it.  Tom had met a sitting President.  How awesome is that?    Anyway, cut to 3 years later, I'm done with LCR.  I'm about to begin looking around for money, and a location.  The story of LCR takes place in New Paltz NY (or a facilmile of it), and I had it in my mind to shoot the whole thing up there.  However, New Paltz is a bitch of a town to shoot in.  About 15 years ago the yuppies had begun to take over, and right now they own the town.  Coffee shops were replaced by Starbucks, the old trucks that used to ramble down main street are now replaced by hundreds of BMWs, Mercedes, H2's, whatever.  During the summer, the town is SWAMPED, meaning it's going to be a fucking bitch to shoot at.  Not only that, but the unions had started coming down hard on small indie projects.  I'm pro-union, being my father worked for the teacher's union, and I understand the need for them.  However, they were going to cost a bundle to deal with.  Also, a ton of permits cost a lot of money, and honestly, at 150K, I don't have that kind of cash to spare, so I needed a different route.  I decided to check out West Lafayette, IN., a really great college town.  I called Tom and let him know what was up, sent him my script.  He read it and really liked it.  REALLY liked it.  So much so he asked if he could help me out, or at least put some cash into the film.    OF COURSE YOU CAN TOM!!!!   But that got me thinking.  Tom knows a LOT of really wealthy folks in Indiana, plus he has some political clout.  He's an attorney and great with people.  How does this translate you ask?  Well, I offered Tom a producer's position on the film.  It's going to be based on how much money he can raise, and what he can bring to the table, but I have total faith that when we premiere the film Tom's name will be next to the Executive Producer title.  We start looking for cash on Monday, keep your fingers crossed, I know I will.  Dane

      Mike Williams, where are you?  Seriously dude, where are you.    Mike was my buddy from New Paltz.  For a year he didn't even know my name while we hung out.  He was this really cool hippy guy from Westchester, with a girlfriend from home.  Anyway, when I was living in NYC, he needed a place to live, so I said to move on in with me in Astoria Queens.  He did, and we shared this really tiny room.  We argued a lot, mostly from me using his soap in the shower, but through it all, we remained friends.    In October of 1997, he got cast in this really small indie film.  He said he had to go to Maryland for 2 weeks and was getting paid a grand for his work.  He came back 2 weeks later, totally scrubbed out, and holding a videotape of his work.  It was this film where these three kids go into the woods and get pissed at each other (not because of soap) and get killed by something.  Yes, the Blair Witch Project.  Only without any of the editing, or cool stuff that made the film.  Just a lot of footage of 3 people stuck in the woods yelling at each other.    Sounded a lot like our apartment.    At the end of the film, Mike looked at us with wide eyes, asking us what we thought.  I said simply:  "Uh...  Do you like... have the money for rent dude?"  Yes, I saw it later when it was finished, the film rocked.  Mike went on Leno and Conan.  He became famous, got married and moved to LA.  About a year ago Mike called me to let me know that he and his wonderful wife Toni had their first baby, a girl.  I was away when he called for a while, and didn't get the message until I got back, by that time it had been erased.  Now I need to get back in touch with Mike, it's really important.  For me at least.  See, my film is about frat boys in an upstate NY college.  Mike was a frat boy from an upstate NY college.  When we lived together we always talked about doing that project together.  Only thing was, we actually intended on going through with it, not just running our mouths.  Now here we are 7 years later, and I've got the perfect project for him, only problem being, I can't fucking find him.  His LA numbers are no more, his cell number is no more.  I introduced him to Danny Leiner a few years ago, and they became friendly.  Now Danny doesn't know where he went either.  Fuck.  He's my guy.  The dude I wrote the lead for Love Courage Respect For, and now I can't find him.  Oh well, that's what a casting agent is for, and I'm about to hire one (hopefully next week).  If anybody can find him, he can.  In the meantime, if you happen to read this, and see Mike Williams, the dude who threw the map away in the Blair Witch Project, tell him Dane said to fucking call him.  It's time to repay him for letting him move into his really small room 7 years earlier and be in his flick.  PS:  No word from Hope Marie yet.

      Last year around November, I was doing a film named after my sister Jen, it was a short film about a dude who falls in love with a videogame character.  It's sort of like The Purple Rose of Cairo meets Lara Croft TombRaider.  It was a short film, that I wrote and was going to direct.  I was going to put my own money into this (about 20K) and got quite a few great deals at post, camera, lighting, houses across NYC.    I knew a few actors whom I wanted to work with, included is my old roommate from Astoria Queens, Mike Williams, whom most people know as "Mike" from the Blair Witch Project.  He rocks, and is probably the best actor whom I know personally.  I also got Stuttering John (I was helping to find funds for his movie before he left the Stern show to move out to LA and become Leno's sidekick, oh yeah, John, answer your fucking calls, ya bastard) to help round out my small cast.  However, I couldn't find a Jenactive anywwhere.  Trust me, I looked.  I wanted somebody attractive, but approachable.  Athletic but not muscular.  Somebody who you could tell had a sense of grace just by looking at them.  In general, I wanted somebody who could deal with the physical part of being in an "action film", let the acting part be damned.  Plus, I feel as the director, it's YOUR FAULT if the performances weren't too good.  It's your job to explain the scene in terms annybody should be able to understand, and make sure you are getting what you want in a scene.  I believe I could work with anybody.  I'm really easy to get along with, and I will always let you know where you stand with me.  I also wrote the script, so I really knew exactly what I wanted in each scene.  I even hired an artist friend of mine to help me come up with story boards.    Anyway, back to the short.  I went through utter hell to find the "right" actress to play the lead.  I worked my ass off, running around from agent to agent, having people read for me, etc etc etc etc etc etc for a few months before I was ready to give up.  My creative partner Eric  suggested I look at some model sites, as he thought that a model might be a better choice than an actress.  So I took a day to look around on the web.  About 2am that night I found, what I thought was the PERFECT actress.  It's this woman named Hope, and she's a model she was perfect: athletic, attractive and had a real sense of grace that just permeated from her photos.  She had cheekbones like geometry, probably one of the best, happiest smiles I've ever seen, and her eyes were absolutely piercing.  Not only that, but she was very "real" looking.  As in, she looks like somebody you might actually know, not a Pam Anderson type.  I could go on and on about how absolutely beautiful this woman is, but it wouldn't do her justice.  Let's just say I'm convinced that she's a muse sent down from Asgard or wherever.  I was sold.  I contacted her, and she said she would read it, I sent her a script and then...  Well, she didn't write back.  I was crushed.  Here, I had found the perfect woman for my project, and she friggin hated it.  That's okay, but I was sort of heartbroken.  I think I probably was a little too enthusiastic in my pursuit, and she probably has been hit on by a ton of different perverts on the net.  I'm a pervert, but not in that way.  I am very professional in my mannerism, especially now that I'm working on my own projects, but still.  I understood, back to the drawing board.  Anyhow, about a month later I found a woman named Messy Stench, who, to be honest, WAS the character.  Hope was perfect, but Messy was perfecterer.  Messy is this really wicked awesome chick from Chicago who is unique in all the best ways.  She's funny, she's caustic, she's feminine, she's really hot and she has dreadlocks that come in about 10 different colors.  Fucking nifty, I wouldn't even have to hire a makeup artist or hair designer, plus she is a freak about really cool fashion, and she just was the character.  I even went out to Chicago to meet her and her boyfriend Nico for Lunch.  They later took me out to some really cool club.  I like them very much.  Messy read for me, and she just nailed it.  She says she's a sucky actress, but that woman has tons of potential.  She did just about everything right.  She did her research before the reading, she ad-libbed, she said where she liked and didn't like the dialogue and proposed changes, and she took direction well.  I had found my lead.  I offered her the part, she accepted, I was psyched.  So I get home to NYC, and what do I find?  An email from Hope, apologizing that she hadn't been able to email me for a bit because she was on the road.  FUCK!!!!  I was sort of embarrassed.  I really didn't know what to say.  It had been a while since I heard from her, and I thought she hated the project, so I moved on.  I was fucking pissed.  Not at her, but at me.  I'm sure it would work out with Messy, but Hope, the beautiful model with the really happy smile and dagger eyes had contacted me, wondering if she still had a shot with the project.  What's a man to do?  Okay, so she also gave me her phone number.  I was sick one football afternoon on Sunday, and I decided to call Hope up.  GOt to leave a message and then drank some Theraflu and zonked out.  About 2 hours later Hope calls up, and I had NO clue who it was at all (Theraflu is cool like dat).  I probably sounded like a retard, but I tried to talk to her and let her know that the part had been taken, and I was going to write her in for a part if she was interested.  She was, sort of, I think she was taken back a little bit, but still.  I zonked out and tried to call her later that night, she never called me back.  I felt like crap.  I know that rejection is about 95% of what this industry is about, but it sucks having to be the guy doing the rejecting.  What was I going to do?  Messy had already NAILED the part, and Hope was a little late on getting back to me.  I guess I really was becoming a director.    Incidently, the project got optioned and probably won't get made for a while.  I needed the cash for my impending nuptuals with my wonderful woman Karen, so alas...  On a side note, I wrote my current project Love Courage Respect in April 2004 after being felled by THREE straight root canals (I need to get help for my addiction to Diet Coke), and wrote a part for both Messy and Hope.  Messy has already said yes, Hope still hasn't answered my email.  I'm going to hold out this time around and hope she emails me back.  She's PERFECT for the part ;)   Dane

      Okay,  Why a blog?  Mostly because I have a huge ego and I feel the world needs to hear what I say.  Okay, that's not it at all.  I'm directing my first film (after 8 years in the industry) and I want a diary to look back at.  I have a really uncanny memory.  It's one of those things that is a blessing in most places, and a curse in a lot of others.  I didn't really figure out that my memory was all that great until midway through college (Purdue University, go Boilers) and I went home to visit.  I met up with friends I hadn't seen in a couple of years, and there wasn't a thing I had forgotten about them.  Like birthdays, family members names, family birthdays, pet names).  This wasn't inclusive to just my close group of friends from HS, which amounted to about 2-3 dudes.  No, this was EVERYBODY.  Kind of scared me.  Here I was a B- student at Purdue, who suddenly realized that he had a photographic memory.  Oh well, maybe I should of stuck it out in pre-med, but who likes the 7 am biochem class on a Saturday.  Fuck it, I was a film major now.  Anyway, a photographic memory doesn't really exist, not on the scientific level.  They just chalk it up as having a really good memory.  However, play me in Trivial Pursuit and you'll realize that I not only have a "really good memory", I have a great memory.  Wicked scary shit.  The problem with memory is that it's not only a blessing, it's a damn curse as well.  For there are a ton of memories I'd love to get rid of (parents getting divorced, getting slashed during an out and out riot in New Paltz).  But that's not why I want to write a blog.  I just want to document for myself how I was feeling during the whole aspect of making my words come to screen, and the fun and hell that I am going to go through to make my dream a reality.  See, I'm MAKING A MOVIE!!!  Yay!!!  8 years making other people's films in various capacities have taught me one thing.  I hate making other people's movies.  Not all of them.  I had a terrific time working on Hal Hartley's film HENRY FOOL, even though I sort of got fired because I got into a car accident with 2 actors (Kevin Corrigan being one of them).  It sucked, but I was there to learn, and I took in everything I could.    But you take the good with the bad.  I also did a ton of CRAP.  Just awful films where, had it been 10 years earlier, the same "director" probably would have been a lawyer or a doctor.  Needless to say, I've worked for a lot of REALLY rich kids who thought they were creative, wrote a lackluster, awful script and then had mom and dad finance the whole thing and then hired me to work on it.  I could go into names, but lets just say of all the films I've worked on, whether as a producer, a script doctor, an AD, or whatever; maybe 10% of them had somehhing going for them other than a big check from Dad.  Sucks, I know, it's the reality of the situation of working in indie film.  I'm not rich.  I don't come from money.  My father (whom I just recently contacted after 13 years of silence, to let him know I'm getting married) was a NYC school teacher.  My mother worked in real estate in upstate NY as well as sold her art.  My stepfather was a GM of a very successful car dealership.  I never wanted for anything, but they aren't really the people I can go to for a check for 150K to make my film.    This means making a film will be up to me, and I couldn't ask for a better team mate than myself.  Of course over the years I've met a lot of people WITH money, and a lot of my close friends have gone on to do some great things in film.  Which is kick ass cool.  Anyway, I'm making a film, it's called "Love Courage Respect", it's about frat boys at a blue collar state college in NY.

      Win some, lose some.  Last night I got an email from Hope, she's got no time for my film.  Sigh.  I hate to lose the perfect DONNA, but alas, she's a feature dancer, and probably makes more in one night than I could possibly pay her for her work.  Yes, I said feature dancer, as in adult feature dancer.  I knew this going in, since she mentioned it when I was casting her from before.  I remember KK (my significant other) asking me if I had a problem with that facet, and I resoundly said "no".  KK then asked me what I would say if somebody brought up that fact after the film was in the can, to which I responded "if anybody brings it up, I'll say 'yeah, wasn't she great, you never know where you're going to find talent these days, next question'".  Did I have a problem with it?  Obviously not, she's beautiful, and I don't think that her career has anything to do with my film (other than the 20 seconds Donna throws off her shirt to seduce the film's hero within the film).  Hope is a really pretty lady, and having her on film would have been fantastic, but I understand, not her thing.  I'm not a stripclub sort of guy as it is, and I only really want people in my film who really  want to be in my film.  Who like the script, who will take the time out to develop the characters, etc, etc.  Hope, wherever you are, whatever you're doing, I wish you nothing but the best, you truly are a beautiful woman.  Speaking of gems, I found one, Audrey friggin' RAWKS!!!  I spoke with her yesterday and she's a really sweet girl (not sweet as in "cool", but sweet as in really sweet).  I watched her film LICK THE STAR again and I'm convinced that she is my heroine.  I think there are a lot of themes in Coppala's short that are underlying themes in my film, like breaking away from the pack, doing the right thing, etc.  After sending her the script, she emailed me to let me know what she's doing now.  She's a Stella Adler grad who is doing a lot of theater work.  She said in her email that if "you thought I was good in that film, wait until you see what I can do now."  You mean she can get better?  I didn't even think of that before.  Dude, sweet.  Anyway, she's looking over the script as I write that, I really hope she digs the part.  It's pretty key, and I only want the best.  Originally I wrote the part for Rachel Leigh Cook, but I realize that at 150K, that's an impossibility, but who knows.  I think Audrey is a discovery waiting to happen (well, I give credit to Ms. Coppala for discovering her, but it would be wicked awesome if my project was "that film" that really broke her to the big time.)

      Had a really weird day today.  I was writing at home, and IFC had a bunch of short films between films or whatever, and I caught this kind of cool, very atmospheric short film called "Lick The Star" that was directed by Sophia Coppala.  I saw this groovy actress named Audrey Heaven, who really had me mezmerized.  I normally would have skipped over the film because it was directed by Coppala, but I didn't know it was her until the end of the film.  I don't dislike her work.  I have no opinion of either Lost in Translation or the Virgin Suicides, and here's why.  In 1997 or early 98, a filmmaker friend of mine had done a pass on the script and was going to direct it for Oliver Stone's company.  I read the script, which would have run about 3 hours, and then read the book.  The script was good, but it had it's slow points, and I asked my friend if I could get a pass on it, he said yes, so long as I detailed everything before he read my pass.  Problem was, he was in LA and I was in NY, and he needed to have the changes within 48 hours because he was going to be in a script meeting with the production company.  So, I locked myself in my room, sat on my bed, and within 24 hours I had sent him over my draft, which I thought tightened the plot, as well as dropping a lot of unnecessary stuff that I thought slowed it down.  I detailed the how, where and why of any changes I made and paid 20 bucks to fax it to my friend (this was pre-internet for most people.)  Friend reads it that day, fucking LOVES it.  Going in to meet, he is going to give me full credit for this, and I will get paid  for my efforts.  Tits.    So, I call the production company the next day, tell them who I am, and what I did, they hadn't heard of me, but would go to talk to the producer to see what's up, they would call me back.  I wait a day, another day, a weekend, another week until I finally called back, they put me on hold for a 1/2 hour until I called them back and then they put me on hold for another 20 minutes until I just gave up for the day.  I call again on Monday, I get a PA, the PA finally puts me in touch with one of his superiors who wound up being an accountant who had no idea what I was talking about.  I finally call my friend, who tells me he's sorry, but the rights to Virgin Suicides got picked up or sold to another company, Zoetrope.  I was fucking pissed.  I worked really really hard, and now it's going to go to be directed by Sophia Coppala.    A year or two later the film came out to really good reviews.  Call it sour grapes, but I can't bring myself to watch it.  Nothing personal, just some sort of weird way to deal with it.  Then when Lost in Translation came out, I couldn't bring myself to see it as well.  My fiance KK said it's one of her favorite films, but no, too much has passed between and Sophia for me to see her work.  It came on PPV, and for a couple of times, I almost caught myself renting it, but alas, to this day, I still have not seen it.  At that point in time I just thought she sucked.    So then I see this short, and while I don't really get it, I think it's really good.  But the one thing I did notice was this actress, Audrey.  Everytime she was on the screen my eyes were transfixed on her, everytime I spoke, she did so with the depth and experience of somebody far older than she was.  She just nailed it.  So I look her up on imdb.com and see that this is the only film that she's worked on, and then I check the director, there it is:  Sophia Coppala.  Dammit, that's so cool it rocks.  Sophia you rock.  I really think Audrey is my "Allison" for the film, my female lead.  I'm calling Audrey tomorrow and sending her a script, I really hope she digs it, it would be cool as hell to be the 2nd person to discover you behind Sophia Coppala, whom I gladly take 2nd place to this time around.
