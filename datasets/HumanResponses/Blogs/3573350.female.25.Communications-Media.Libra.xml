      I promised too much and never get to keep 'em. Aaargh..! Okay.. here's the thing. Its Joko's bday and he booked me since 10am for some beer at 8pm. Before that I have to go to Sentul Circuit at 2pm and attend my hospital session at 5pm. Got another appointment with Donna to pick up some flyers and dat should be flexible. Smart ass Sylvia thought she can arrange everything and be able to meet all those appointments....  Turn out.. i got out off the office late. Sentul Circuit was taking a bit longer than i thought. So i was late for da doctor appointment and had to wait for five other patients before my turn. Picking up my medicine took about another hour and that was 8:30pm already. I went to Donna and she stood me for at least another hour because she didnt know i have arrived. Flyers were done at about 10:30pm but Joko had already called and cancelled cuz i was taking too long.   Whoooaaa.....i feel baaaaad... I dont have some super power to be at all places in one time.  So, i learn my lesson. Betta' put some priority and its okay to say "NO" before somebody starts hating you cuz you always say you can make it but never did so.. Hmm... Im sorry Joko..and Happy Birthday Buddy..

      GUESS who gave me a call just now??? Baby Boy Jon! He's Back!!!! But not for long, he's only stopping by for a couple of hours to attend some meeting, and in the morning he will fly again to Hawaii. Well, He had a great time in Holland ( he went to hamburg as well ) its his first time, and he's havin' it good! Im glad. The Boy is excited about red light district and those coffee shops - Hihihi...typical first timer in amsterdam! Iz good, Iz gooood... Jon is too well mannered, he surely needs some MISCHIEFS in his life..! He said he didnt sleep at all during his flight from Amsterdam to Jakarta, and it sounds like he's really tired. So, im gonna let him sleep and have him fly fresh to his hometown tomorrow. Im gonna see him soon anyways ( with my vanilla scents from bath and body works )..*wink*..hehehe! Miss ya boy. Take care..  Anyways, this morning i had some quality time with my brother looking for some dope movies. And..we succesfully came home with 12 DVDs. We spent the whole day lazying around and watched at least five movies. There's this one movie tho', its called "you got served" - about some hommies down in L.A. - Gee, if you guys are in love with hiphop and liking the dance, this is a MUST-SEE movie. Its Dopin' Entertainin'..! Gotta give it to Donna, she gonna looove this shit..  Speaking of Entertainment, Yeaah... D'Makaveli at Manna last friday was a total entertainment. It was goooood *smilling* we got some quality crowds comin'. Me and Donna was like "yeah...keep comin' y'all". Its da bomb, really. Donna was lookin' good, her husband is outta town and she's using the opportunity to look good ( without censor ) Hehehe. She got this hot camisole on and its lookin' great! While me...Lookin' like shit. Got off work late and came straight to Manna. Didnt got to shower, didnt got to dress up. But, things run smooth, and there's nothin' else to take care of, im tired so i left early. But, it was great. thanks guys. Love y'all loads...

      Suddenly thought about the gurls and our good times together. Back in college. Ooo..we are bunch of bitches. We would hang around and skip class, and then play pokers with bets and money. We would stick together and others would be scared of us, we would smoke pot around the campus and never get caught, we would cheat and exchange answers during exams, we would cover each other's back when someone's in trouble. We are super styilin'. We are eternal! Aaah.. those gals are the best.  I miss them a lot. They got carreers of their own. Khika is in Bali and she's a PR in Conrad. Ocha is doing so well in Hewlett Packard. Dini is in MTV. Tania is in Leo Burnett Advertising. Ayu is dancing in a lot of countries. Acha is... What Cha Doin' Gal?? Hehehe...and Donna is doing soooo... well with her life, Makaveli and her husband.. Gals... i am so proud of you all. I miss you and i thank you for the friendship, the good times and the bond we have together. Thank you..Thank you..Thank you... Ya'll Da BEST!

      Jerks. What makes them Jerks? Is it how they're born with it? Or Is it Us?  As i speak to my one of my friends at Indika about her love journey, the analogy of it, hits.  *so much drama in the world - twist of marley - playing* So..either in the past, right now or tomorrow, at least once, gurls about to run to one particular heartbreaker known as Jerk. They're in da heart, they're in da head, they're in da skin, they're everywhere. What attracts them? We oftem blame them of causing heart break. We judge merely upon sentiments. Stuck one finger up and point upon his unforgiven face.  But..do you ever once reflects and evaluate yourself upon the incidents? I am not trying to defend those M*th*rf*ck*rs. I am trying to teach myself ( and whoever is reading this post ) not to be scared of who you really are, spill the guts, face it and cope with it.  Evaluate. Do you ever think about what people sees in you? have you present yourself well for da public. What is your actual presentation?  A girl? A one-nite-stand-ner? A woman? A Bitch? A lady?  A Homosexual? A Bisexual? A player? A grown-up?  You might think one of em is you, regardless what it is. But do they look at you the same? Do they percieve the same as you percieve yourself......? scary 'eh? So...think, before you make any judgements, Think.  Is it them? Is it you? Is it both of us? Peace..

      Its Baaaaaad...... when you are out with your very good friend after some time while having some Benjamins in your pocket, why? Cuz at the end of the day, you reach back into dat pocket and find those Benjamins are GONE. Hahaha... Dat was exactly what me and Donna had done.  So..we had a meeting at Plaza Senayan, what a bad place for a meeting! Cuz everything was on sale and we have just receive some payments from some of the events - Neither Donna or Myself is concentrating. And yeaaah... we spent it all on food, clothing and some good time! Hey, some good time are EXPENSIVE. Not mentioning those good bowls of bakso and another dish of Siomay we had at her house.  We hadnt done this for a long time, Me and Donna. We're at times too busy doubling jobs for ourselfs. How i miss the old good times we had. So free... So Careless -- but most of the time: Broke. Hahaha... I guess Its YINYANG Laah. There's Two Sides of Everything: Positive and Negative. Think about it...  Well...Hehehe..im putting up Donna's picture here.. The peace Sign, The Surrender look, Cant fight the Sale Temptations.. *this pic was actually taken at The Hilton on New Year's Eve 2004 but, i swear she looked like this yesterday*

      Jon called at lunch time, i havent talk to him for about a week. Its bad, eh? I been focusing myself to work trying get over my furious mind off this AFRO LOOKING DUDE comin' from accross the country... And end up forgetting my dear dear dear dear friend of mine Jon Darling...eh Dowling. Hehe. He's going away to Amsterdam, Vegas and Honolulu for 5 weeks. Im gonna MISS him..  He's always been there for me whenever i need to bitch about things. Its usually stupid and he usually say im smart enough and not actually need second opinion to solve things. Its true, but talking to Jon is a theraphy for me, he's got a way to calm me down and put my mood back in normal. He's got dozens of patience for a noisy gurl like me. Thank you for your patience Jonnie!! He is one genius dude who always been able to answer my questions about science, life, technology, and almost everytime..everything. You come in a good package buddy, one that my girl friends be jealous about! Besides being sooo kind, Hehehe.... gotta say those ripped arms, and indo-bule look are pretty good! Anyways, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. Hurry back, cuz im gonna MISS you bad..

      Makaveli last performance was awesome. Stan, Joga and Herbs were on fire from the start til the end - and dat was like 4:30am. Manna House was packed and its great to see our promotion efforts are finally PAID OFF. Donna and I used to crawl down the streets ourself to distribute each single flyers. We were this dynamic duo who doesnt know what "tired" means. So it is completely fair now if we got this far. Holler!  TOO PHAT rocks the party. I admire them a lot. The two great rappers were very humble, uncle amman and the b-boyz were extremely cool, and DJ T-Bone was MAGNIFICENT. The guy looked pretty chilled out off duty, but on the deck, he's the fastest man ever! He got this well-built charisma that springs out of him, and it was so hard to resist 'em. Hehhe.. the next time i come down to KL, the man promise to take me out to ZOUK-KL where he spins. And dat would be WONDERFUL....!!  I guess i stayed too long to wach T-Bone performin' and came back home at 5am - which leaves me only 3 hours of sleep to be able to do the NOKIA launching the same day at 8am. It was a hard day to do some work! Man! I cant remember how many times i almost fell asleep while we load some of the equipments and during the rehearsal procession. But, Alhamdulilah... the 7200 Special Edition was launched perfect and successful. The sweats were completely worth it.   My cousin RENA is Ijab Kabul yesterday to marry his boyfriend, dat was heart warming. So.. my weekend were great, and i look forward to my next one. Holler!

      Haha...just came back from lunch with my buddy Soren, topic for today was Wedding. Eugh..do i actually have to think about this? Woo... i got goosebumps. He was telling me his idea of his invitees: Pajamas! -- and i told the man he should re-think it over and come up with something better on our next lunch chat. Dont do that to your woman, Buddy.  Then, he ask me how am i gonna do my wedding. Then i start smilling and daydreaming ( at lunch -- and this is not my usual habit ) so somethings gotta be wrong with me here.... Venue : Any beach -- probably ANYER Dress-code : Anything comfortable Music : Live jamaican band Time : Sunset F&B : Seafood Barbeque & White Wine Groom: ------> thats another story...hahaha.... Soren thinks im picky, i think im being very honest to myself. well..well...its enough for the day dreaming, i have to do my NOKIA launching..

      At times like this, it is the most of all times i want to go and dip my fingers on the sand. Feel the sun over my skin. I miss the sound of the waves and the peaceful ambiance it gives me. I want to lay down and watch the moon walks over my head. I miss the sea breeze blowin' my hair.. i wanna come back and tell the sea whats been going on with me... save my soul...

Aaaay... Sexy! I heard of his name plenty of times (&nbsp;well at least from da TTC guys ) and never thought he'll be looking so good like last nite. His manager, Poppy is my ol' friend from college, and she'd really like it if i kick it with him... I think both of us were making 'eyes' to each other - not quite sure, Bliss was dark!  I like.. I like.. I like.. I like.. Aaaaw... But, i got chickened out... MATI GAYA!  Hehehehehehehe... im such a kid.

      JON IS DA BEST. He bring me da best gift ever: Bath and Body Works stuff!!!! One of em is the 1st best scent in da world of Bath and Body Works: Warm Vanilla Sugar!   I love JON! Big up for the man who understand what women wants…   *applause*  Anyways, I got off work early and went to see Jon rite away. Whooaa… Jon put on weight!  He said its only 5 kilos, but it seemed obvious to my eyes? Or is it cuz I haven’t seen him for 30 days? Got to admit that I rarely meet men who are as big as Jon, but I swear he looked so BIG.  Not like FAT big, nor CHUBBY big… and not quite BULKY either. Aaah… don’t know how to explain it laah… he’s just big. Maybe like Jay-Z big… I don’t know??? He’s 6’1 Feet and im 5 Feet Flat, maybe he’s not as big… just that im too small. Okay enough with da BIG talk now, I might pist him off. *Raise Hand* …Waiteeeeer!!!  Well, we spent hours chatting, hoooo..i missed that. I took a glass of Coke and pour some Chivas Regal in it. Relaxiiing… and we chat and chat and chat… He was celebrating his dad’s birthday in Hawaii, attend some seminar down in Vegas and visiting his Timmy Boy Brother in Colorado. During the conversation, he explain some food science things ( which I couldn’t recall anymore ) and explicate what it does to the food. He’s like the master man on this shit. As he speak, im like: wooo… I wish I know what you’re talking about, man. After 10 seconds he goes: you don’t know what im saying ‘eh?  Bwhahahahuehuaha…  Ooo.. we gave Khika a call rite? And Jon put her on a speaker. They talk bullshit for awhile and shortly after dat, Khika goes: Can you give the phone to Sylvia? Then I went: Whats up Gurl?  And Khika said: …Ooo… I get so HORNY just to hear his voice!!!!!   SHE WAS STILL ON A SPEAKER! AND JON OBVIOUSLY HEARD IT!!!!   Huahuahuahuhahahahaa… She was so embarrassed!!! Yeah, that’s funny, and Jon’s face turn red.   We got to check out his BOSE speakers dat was just got hanged on its stand. Turn some Café Del Mar on, it was peeeerrrfect! Its worth the price laa..! He showed me his new Macintosh Laptop and doesn’t know what to do with the old one. I said: you can lend it to me… NOT! Hehe!  Well, it was getting late and Jon got to leave to meet his ‘superpimp’ cousin Troy. Troy’s driver was taking us with an E-Class Mercedes *feeling ritzy*. The driver and the guard were so obedient, not like Jon’s driver: Sukmana.  He’s a PUNK – and I like him better. Mr. Sukmana ( who sometimes we call SukMacher ) drives better and behaves better: PUNKish!  Sylvia totally aint cut to be a millionaire’s wife. Even if I do, I’d rather drive my own Porsche Cayenne my self!   Anyways, the joy I had should recharged my soul til the next time I see him. I definitely enjoy his company and cherish the relationship we have. I am happy dat he’s back around.  Jon, Buddy, Thank You!&nbsp;  PLANS TODAY: is D'Makaveli SHOWCASE 'Campus Nite' at Bliss. Gonna come early to meet Donna there. We probably gonna discuss some follow ups about FUZZ. Donna probably will bitch again about&nbsp;party GEAR. Yep, this morning i woke up late and forgot to bring tonite's gear 'again' - dis happen a lot... Heheh... Well thats dat. Dont miss tonite's gig. Its Hot! Holler!

      Got an sms from Jon, so i might see him after work today.  I didnt bring the CD i made for him, he hasnt been updated for over a month..&nbsp;so he wont like that.  I also made him chocolate chip cookies from a Betty Crocker box, but half of the jar was gone in the mouth of Andre, Zidane and Devya. Not a pretty gift 'eh? Its&nbsp; my fault&nbsp;that i lay&nbsp;the jar around the house 'unprotected'.   Im suppose to get my Bath & Body Works stuff from him. And i feel bad about coming round empty handed. Or.. maybe i could get him some stuff from da cafe downstairs? Like we all know, when Jon&nbsp;gets pist, cure him with some food.  Huehehee....

Remembering of this sentence once said to me  &nbsp;    “I been thinking a lot, having crazy dreams  The kind that don’t leave you alone  Ones that keep you wondering  Wishing that you.. See what I Believe..”    &nbsp;  Now let me share it with all of you and see if it touches you as much as it touches me.. The song is called Never by RL Ements

      I knew it, i knew he's gonna call me today! He's Back, People...    Jonathan Dowling is Back in Town!    And it is so typically him... that he didnt tell me anything about his&nbsp;PULANG KAMPUNG trip to Hawaii - no matter how hard i make him to, he wont tell...  He just say: &nbsp; "my trip is okay" - "work is fine" - "im good" - "yeaaa...its alrite"   That is so JON!  He knew i would come back and ask even more cuz he kept it so mysterious! and&nbsp;instead of telling me, he would ASK hundreds of questions about: ME.  This guy really know how to distract my head....  and certainly: re-distract it back!   Anyways, im gonna catch up with him in a bit! Gosh, i miss him a lot! I feel so relieve that he's back!  at least i know where to BITCH again after a month...  No la.. im kidding... I really miss him a whole loads...

      Aaah...&nbsp;Missed Makaveli's Coast To Coast on Friday. The whole crew said it was probably the tigthest party ever made by D'Makaveli...!  Cha'Chiiiing!!!!!  *Sound of a Cash Register Machine* Hehehee....  The presentation at KL was NOT FUN. It was very time consuming and mood drowning. Was it like a 'Four Hour' thang or something? Damn, I didnt even have the time to see Fuzz. Should have been FUN if i could kick it in the Club with him.  Maybe in August, Lah! Or if not, i come again for holiday in October or so, a Birthday Trip to myself.   When i come back, i went right up to my PC and&nbsp;did 5 Flyers and 1 Poster in 3-HOURS time! ( now i believe im talented&nbsp;for this whole graphic design thing ). I finished at about 4pm, watched Ali G Aiii, get ready and went to Donna's to finalize the text copy. Phew, productive weekend, aint it? I likeee.....   Well, im back at my desk now. Catching off where i left on friday.  I might write again, cuz i havent bitch at all. Hehehe...    Eh, I&nbsp;Want My Buddy JON. Where in da World is he Now? I Miss Him!!!

With better and stonger skills. I call myself a PR Person, and i know damn rite how to use it. I dont get angry that easy, really, and i am very much forgiveful&nbsp;but... you betta not making PIST! Once i do, i&nbsp;keep the anger rot in my blood, and dat&nbsp;could really move me into doing some meanful things we call: Revenge. &nbsp;   YOU!  If you ever realize who am i writting this note for, betta watch out.  I&nbsp;aint got&nbsp;nothing to loose...  If by chance people FOUND OUT,&nbsp;they look at me as a&nbsp;VICTIM!

And yeah... make me feel good, make me feel BETTER! Then...I shall forget...   My meanest revenge is what we call: SOCIAL PUNISHMENT!  Damn it! Think of the damage to your life it can put you...  God, i gave it to someone back then, and i dont feel like getting another one into the same misery.  Please make me strong, and let my heart be as ikhlas as my words...  Bring him some Consciousness...  Before i act upon my anger...

      I had Arya Van Bogor visiting me at the office yesterday. He came to see my boss about the Jet Car thang. Afterwards me and him had lunch together to discuss about it and Dang! This boy knows a lot. He said some things i wouldnt have ever thought about. This guy is an expert. See i wasnt wrong taking him in. Somewhere in my mind i got a hinch that he even knows better than my Boss. Today he suppose to come back to us and decide wether he's in or not - too bad he's still taking classes, ya?   I left office kinda late last nite. Im doing our tour schedule with Rizky and Okky. This is some 13 cities organizing, so i suppose it took that long to get all the details figured out and written down on excel! It was woth it la...! Its done and i dont have to worry about it for the rest of the week. Today i plan on booking all the accomodations and transportations. Airlines are one of the companies i hate to call... they always put me on hold for looooong time!   I talk to Donna a lil bit last nite, we are planning on flying Fuzz and Altimet from Kuala Lumpur. I called up Fuzz last night and he likes the idea. So, im gonna come over to Donna's today to discuss about it while finish some of my unfinished designs for next month's flyers. Rough week..rough week..! Holler!

      So, we had a meeting for the project i called "Da Big Bang". According to the previous coordination, i'm gonna have to handle two projects at one time. The other project is kind of small, boring and really isnt my favor to do, and i am quite upset because i have to lay off my hand from some of the things i should have handled. I mean, WTF? im there since da beginning, all the preparations, all the contracts and i expected to be there from the night before the D-Day and the night after the D-Day...  I expect myself gettin' all fucked up and real tired with all the crew in Sentul!!! My mood is dropping. Seriously.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Good thing about it, though. Im hiring Donna to assist the superstar guest. If i cant do it, then she's the only person in this whole world i trust to take over my work. Donna wont let me down. Press Conference, Radio Interviews, Tight Schedules, Securities..  Piece of cake for Donna, Laah..I'll brief her and she'll run it smooth! &nbsp; And for the Super Fast Car from FM Racing Sydney, im gonna have Arya Van Bogor to help out. Hm.. cant go wrong wit this one, rite? He's Da Man. Probably Da ONLY Man dats eligible for it. Yeaaah... &nbsp; Well... at the end, this doesnt sound so bad. Im giving my wonderful friends some wonderful experiences.... But AAAaaaAAaaaggHhhh..... I wish it was all me alone.....

      Hoowheeeyy...  Been long since the last time i blog. Well, Im back again to share..  &nbsp;  Fuzz and Altimet came. This duo from KL rocks. Fuzz is seriously funny, i mean i could laugh in every second, its like every one of three words he said were hilarious, plus he’s very humble, so he really is one cool package, you know, remembering his talented fingers on da turntable…!! The other nite, he performed some DJ tricks and put up great selection of hiphop tracks dat lure most of everyone in the corner to the dancefloor. Its not everyday that you caught gurls dancing on the bar table in Blowfish, rite? Well, that’s how awesome he is.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Altimet is one splendid MC. He’s got this flow goin’ and I loooooove his accent. To my ears, he sounded of a mix to Jamaican, Malay and British. As I love Chaka Demus, Sean Paul, Shaba Ranks and Bob Marley, this Altimet guy is definitely my flavor!  &nbsp;  They toured all the Clubs in Jakarta, checking out, living it up and representing. Their last party was extremely successful, they rock Blowfish. With Fuzz on da mix and Altimet on da mic, they’re impossibly beatable. So far, this is da best Duo performer ever. Like a perfect verse over tight lyrics...  And to that I toast, too much dat I get too drunk. Hehehe..  &nbsp;  Altimet gave me a copy of their new album “how’s the level” dats about to drop in a few weeks time. I been listening to it in da past couple of days. He wants me to come up with 5 best tracks. Its really hard to do that, cuz I like most of the songs. But I know im gonna pick this one track titled “reminisce” as da winner. Once again I just couldn’t resist da flow…    “Do you remember this? Do you remember that? As we sit back and reminisce”  “Lets take a trip down memory lane, as history plays in the back of my brain, like in the day, I used to stay up all nite….”  Aaaaaaah….  &nbsp;   Anyways, If this Album ever get to Indonesia or If you people ever find this Album by Teh Tarik Crew titled How’s The Level, Hurry Grab It! No Regrets, I Promise! I let Donna listened to it, rite? And she went craaaaazy about it. Me and Donna is Teh Tarik Crew’s Biggest Fans!!! Well, anyhow to me, iz like you listened to PM Dawn, De La Soul and a bit of Will Smith’s in one album – with some Malay influence, ofcourse!&nbsp;  Good Luck&nbsp;to TTC, Respect.  &nbsp;  Well, that’s dat. My most wonderful week of da month, and now I better get my ass back to work, catch up some few days I lost and get the tunes back in my rhyme…  Holler!  &nbsp;  *112, Notorius BIG and PDD - Only You, on Da Speaker*

      Well, like my daddy use to say to my brother, "stand up, be a man and face it" - in this case i'll stand up, be brave and face it!  I gotta say its pretty fucked up&nbsp;and i wish i can be&nbsp;someone who I am not in times like this. I want to be able to break wild and pist loud. I want to be ignorant and irresponsible.  Im so&nbsp;sad that my chest felt so heavy when i breathe, i want to be bad and put some revenge. Oh God, and i hate the fact that in the morning i wouldnt be able to do what i've said tonight.  My dad always say this too "walk in with face seen, walk out with shoulder seen". Hebat ya?  Yes, Dad! Im gonna do that. I got your blood in me. You are so strong and im gonna show you im nothing different than you are. Your baby gurl has grown up, she made a mistake and she will bear the consequences.  Insya Allah i'm all Ikhlas and may all of this be a good lesson for me and all the people involved within. God, make me strong. Amin.

      Back at the office again, and its Monday. Things were running great for the Weekend. Yamaha went great and so does Makaveli at Manna. I didnt get to come because we finish off kinda late. Sunday was Jehan's birthday. We gave her a surprise party at da basketball court. Afterwards we went to play billiards.  Really, i like my friends at work and like 'em even better outside work. They're crazy mother fuckers.. Bet Rp. 5000,- on every lost.  We stayed up til like 12:30. I was real tired when i got home and went right up to bed.. then dream about MORGAN. Hehe, couldnt remember vividly about it but, i knew he was there and i knew it was something real sweet. Aaaah.....

Nobody talks to him, except for me and that was only about the postponed payment on one of our models.. i wouldnt even call it "talk" i was "bitching" man. Oooh i felt sooo bad for that guy. Hihihihi.... everyone was like.. "ANANG!! Give me my This!! Give me my that!! Hurry up we're on a fucking deadline!!" aaargh.. we gave him horrible birthday morning, seriously!! Hihihihi..

Man, This song is kicking ass.   Well, while we on dat subject. How come that i think of Morgan so much these days? Whats going on, ya? I hope he's okay...  Do you believe in Telepathy? I dont. I want to believe it. But, so far i dont. Cuz if it does happen, Morgan would have come out of his bunker and whup my ass cuz the message i been sending him would have been TOO MUCH!!! Hehehehe...   I met Morgan on July 2000. I saw him again July 2002 and he suppose to be back here by NOW!!! July 2004. Where is he?  I must have cause him something terrible, cuz he's like GONE. Like he dissapear from the surface of the earth.   "Its funny when sometimes you feel like you got the world wrapped around your finger but at other times, the world is one big dessert that got people lost without a trace"   Like Now..   *sigh*

      Wassup wassup... so its 7:30pm, im about 98% done with work, just need to call up a few people for tomorrow's appointment. Gotta put up some down payment for our show on the 10th. Im on my desk, almost everyone is gone..just a few workoholics left. The air-con has been turned off, and im sitting back enjoying my marlboro lights menthol with a glass of nescafe and some marley tunes on the speaker.  Im gonna have an appraisal tomorrow. They're gonna review my work in the past 6 months. So..its either they gonna burst out pist or they're gonna give me a promotion. My 6 months tenure in Indika has been wonderful. My collegues are great, my work is fun and i have learn so much about this event management thing. There are still so much that i could dig from and my skill development journey aint over yet.  As much as i am nervous about tomorrow morning, im excited as well. Its about time for myself to recieve some critics, inputs and compliments from my Boss. So..we'll see. We'll see..

      Soo...I was on my desk. Feelin' a bit low about work load. A bit less excited than the usual Sylvia. Nothin' special had actually happen and life just felt kinda bare...Then, my cellphone rang. Its says "WITHELD" -- Hm.. I was like, heeey.. just what i need, a li'l surprise. Witheld calls are usually made from abroad.. As i pick up the phone my mind goes.. Jon? Morgan? Dave? ..... "Hallo...???" Then the voice on the other line goes.. "Halooo...Sylvia.." Then i went.. "Heeeeeyyy...JOOONN!!" Its crazy huh? First Hinch! Its JON.  So good to talk to him. We were discussing about our friend who suddenly got married. And after a bit, we hung up. It's 10pm in Hawaii and he's chilling out in his living room. WOW. Palm Trees...Beaches...Coconuts...Clear White Sands... Jon, you lucky bastard! Hehehe.. I miss you loads, buddy. Take Care..

      Morgan Luke Christensen, I wonder how you are doing… Last nite I had a dream about you again: I was in Amazon for some reason, and you showed up as my tour-guide. Funny thing about da meeting is dat you don’t remember who I was??!! Later on I found out dat you had amnesia. It didn’t stop us from having such magnificent times together. We were these two jungle-maniacs, going in and out of da Forrest, rowing far and far to the heart of the amazons, we were KINGS of da jungle! Somewhere within da dream, your long-term memory loss didn’t get to change anything; We are back to square one!  *smile* Remembering Fountain Lounge at the Hyatt *closing my eyes and reminisce it all clear*

      A friend of mine came with tears. I guess I know that this is about to come whether sooner or later.  In da middle of my “finding nemo” sitting, she called with a trembling voice. That moment I knew, her heart was broken. The only man she ever loved for the past six years had been taken away, and marries a girl, who else’s but her best friend. She came into my door a few minutes after da call. I’ve never seen her cried like that, ever. And yes, the whole dilemma seemed so WRONG. There is no written code on such things like this; it is nowhere in Da Dictionary, Da Encyclopedia nor even Da Holy Quran. MARRYING YOUR BEST FRIEND’S TRUE LOVE? I cried as she breaks down on my arms, regretting the fact that such ugly thing is happening within our circle of sisterhood. Where’s da love? da respect and da tolerance? Ya Allah, forgive me, two of this gals are my good friends. And indeed, I blame. Shall this happen again, at least wait a few moments? Or, wait longer than ONE MONTH! Hey, happy-couple to be! For the goods of your friend and yourself. Wait! You barely even know someone within’ a month… or do you? And for the sake of Da Broken Heart, please wait…  And for the ending of this case im gonna quote some lines from Alicia Keys’ song:     Some people live for the fortune Some people live for the fame Some people live for the power Some people wants diamond ring Some people want everything Some people thing that these are the things defines whats within…   Sounds so wrong, innit? The Happy-Girl to be! I disgust your decision yet you are still my friend. I will always be your friend but I want you to know that rite now my heart is aching for our friend who is now throbbing.

      Two of my friends are going to get married to each other. FOR THE WRONG REASON. Donna said i dont have the rights to judge, but dont i have the rights to have my own thoughts? Justify all the things that goes around me into my own values and principles? My thoughts are these: this marriage is wrong cuz one is based upon material enrichment considerations and the other one is based upon "deadline" considerations. Fuck that, where are you guys taking this sacred matrimony into, eh? Hell? It takes a lot of love to be with just one person for the rest of your life, it takes a lot of love to give up half of your egoism, it takes a lot of love sacrifice the fun of single-life. These two start out without love, so this two will leave out with no love either. Sad.. but its true..
