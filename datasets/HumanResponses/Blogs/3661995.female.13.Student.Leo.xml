      It's been so long sice I used the computer. Stupid Eve! She really likes to irk me... Asking me to help her with her Chinese homework AGAIN! Why can't she do it herself? Oh, right, she will flunk it without my help. I'm glad she finished her History, now I can play my games in peace, without her nagging at my ear every five seconds.   The holidays are ending... why does everything has an end? Stories have ends, life ends too. Why must every single thing have an end? Puzzling, isn't it? My brother is going away to Thailand for 9 days! YAY!!! Freedom! Though there will be school. With school, there will be homework and tests, when will there be time for me to do my own stuff?   Time really flies when you have fun... it's already Jun 25 now. Mom just called me, apparently my brother got his graduation hat. It looks... dumb, square and hard... I dunno... His graduation is in July. Mom is probably going to attend it without me or Eve...

      I think I should speak up more... for too long, I have been left... standing in my dark's shadow, watching her glory, it's been too long...  I sometimes wish she would just go away, but she comes back to hound me when I try to drive her away...I think I'm going crazy... or maybe, I'm already insane...  I hate it when she pretends to be me, lying so outrageously... but I envy her, she dares. She has the guts to talk back, fight back,defiant and rebellious in things she fiercely believes in, unlike me... I fear... everyone, everything...   She tolerates me, but I am jealous... I can't help it.. I want to believe that she is me, but, we have completely separated ourselves. We are too different, drifted too far apart to know each other again.  I am such a horrible person. So useless... no wonder I'm always outshined by her...  Everytime I see her, she is always surrounded by a certain bright aura. Why is she better than me? We look alike, we even talk alike, but our personalities are different.  She wants to help me, I know. She talks to me in the night, when we are supposed to be sleeping. She tells me how to make friends, how to fit in, but I always stick out, like a  sore thumb.   To people, I'm the more cheerful one, the happier one, but that's only a mask. Inside, everytime I try to be what she is, I can feel a knife twisting in the depths of my heart. I hate lying, deceiving people, but I've become so good at it, I can't feel myself own self anyway. Have I become a shadow of her? A poor imitation?   Will I ever find my true self? Or be forever like her...

      Aargh! I hate having a look alike sometimes. Eve made me go to that dumb concert recital of hers! I almost totally screwed the whole thing up! I can hardly play her pieces, but thank heavens, I managed to play the three pieces SHE was supposed to play. I made some mistakes, but it's not my fault! She's the one who took the lessons, not me! I learn the flute, not piano.  I got slightly carsick-I mean trainsick. Hey, it's all the way from Yew Tee to Bugis! The whole journey's about 45 mins, and wasting all that time on a dumb train is not worth!  I have to go really soon now, but I'll do some plugging first. To whoever is reading this now, if you have time, pop over to www.fictionpress.com/~Rowenisvanya and read our works. We, as in Eve and I, ok?? Please review too!   Okay, I'm done with all that shameless plugging. Haizz... have to concentrate on my homework now... HAIZZZZZZ!!!!

       Sucks! Why do time fly when you're having fun? It's not fair... School has reopen, and I hate it! I have a new shift of timetable again. Honestly, why do they keep changing the stupid timetable?! It's not only annoying, also very iriitating!     My mother and I are the only ones home for this week. My elderst brother is in Bangkok, Thailand to perform. Lucky him!!! My second brother is away in the army. Yay! The computer's all my now!!! Well, at least for a week...    I have recently downloaded some new anime. Yay! Now I can watch Inu Yasha and many others in their original voices! I hate dubs, their voices suck! As you can see, I'm a really big anime/manga junkie. I will be really snappish without my daily dose... sounds like addiction... -_-|||     Anyway, school today was VERY BORING! I miss my old history teacher, Ms Fazlin, though I hate her homework. She's really amusing and witty. However, I like my new literature teacher more than the old one. Ms Tang, that's the new one, is pretty interesting, better than the dull Mr Goh... I think his jokes are worth less than 1 cent... no offence, but they're really LAME!    I'm going off now... to surf some sites. I wanna play gaia. The pics are soooo good..^____^ See ya!

         Yay!! I just finished my history! I still have English and Chinese left though... TT___TT.   Sigh... I still hate homework... why! Why must school reopened next week? Why???? I don't want the holidays to end. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!      Aargh, she's asking me to get off the computer again. Really, Eva, you can be soooo not understanding. I just completed my History homework, why can't I just write or enjoy myself for a while... you can use the other computer...that doesn't have internet! (laughs) I'm being mean again...      Seems like today's post will be this short, since I have to let her use the computer... aargh, she's calling mom. Evalyn!!! Grr! I'll get you!

       As the title had said, elusive blocks here meant that I got lost trying to locate a few blocks of houses! Dumb, isn't it? Curse that bloody architech! Why did he have to built the few blocks like a maze?? GRR!      It all began last week, when my mother received a call from my cousin. It seems that my cousin's mother-in-law had passed away. So, my mother decided to go to her funeral today. And, she brought ME along, for she said that I face the computer for too long, and that I needed to go out for fresh air... Hah! How can one get fresh air in this polluted world? Our skies are hazy with smoke! You call that fresh air? Riduculous! Ahem, as I was saying, we went to Tampines by train, and when we reached there, my mother didn't know where to go. Of course, I don't too, considering it's my first time there, and that I didn't have the address.      So, my mother telephoned to my cousin's house, but she was not at home. Her son picked up the phone, however. He gave us directions, but it was wrong!! We ended up wondering around the few blocks of 260, 254, 257 and 258! But 259 could not be found!!! Isn't it really dumb? If there is 260 and 258, it should be a piece of cake to locate 259! But NO!!! We had to walk around, and thanks to the wrong directions given to us when we asked the residents, we winded up far from our destination. What I don't understand is, why don't the residents know where block 259 was? I mean, they lived around those few blocks, and they don't know?      Anyway, after a long walk, we finally made it to the funeral, but it was damm late, about 9pm. We could only stay for about an hour or so, because my mother had to work the next day, and she was worried that the train will stop operating if it was too late. I really wanted to throttle that kid, since I do have the authority. I am his aunt after all... I feel so old, being someone's aunt even though I only like thirteen... In fact, his brother is older than me, but my status is still higher, hah! They won't acknowledge me as their aunt though... Haizzz.....        I really have to finish up all my homework soon, school is starting... I HATE SCHOOL!!!

       Aagh! My interent connection is down! This is the second time today!! I'm currently using my elderest brother's computer. He's the computer genius in the family... coz that's what he studied in the university. He's at work now while my second brother is in the army.       I wish I could fix it myself... but I'm completely clueless on how, so I guess I'll be using his computer then. Hopefully, I won't damage his too. I seem to be disatrous with technology. I swear, everything related to electricity breaks down when I am near it...      I'm currently surfing the net, hoping to find some place of interest. I"M BORED! Maybe I should do my homework... or maybe, she'll do it for me.        Well, off to surf again! Bye!!

       I'm trying to empty myself of all emotions. I don't understand it myself, so don't ask.(laughs) I just got a verbal lashing from my mother and brother each. How come I'm still so calm? I should have blown up by now... Maybe it's all the tea I drank for breakfast...(6 cups)but whatever, I don't know.         I really have to start doing my other homework now... I still have Art, History, English and Chinese left.... I'm such a failure T__T.... Haizzz.... this is no longer called a holiday... and my teacher actually calls there piles of homework "homejoy"... yeah right... probably homisuicidical... is there such a word? (laughs) I guess not... My white hair are increasing although I barely reached my teens... still have a month to my birthday... minutes are ticking away, my life is ebbing away... so what else is new? That, I don't know...            What does it feels to be dead?      Sure, I know you either get cremated or buried, but that's just your body... what about your soul? What happens to it? Does it goes to heaven? Get reborn in a new body? Travels down to burn endlessly in a firey chasm for eternity? Wanders around earth all alone? Is death scary? Why are people afraid of dying?       I'm not scared of death, in fact, I'm curious. If life can be like a game, in which you can easily save or load, I'll try to find out what exactly is death.     Do you think life is a game to certain people? I mean, could we be pawns in a game? Or dolls manipulated in a giant dollhouse called Earth?        Do we really make our own decisions, or is there someone controlling us? How do you know whether you're truly alive? Is this all reality, or just a dream? Are we all decived by illusions?         Is there really a God in this world? Did Jesus Christ really rise from the dead? Did he even die in the first place?          Is there even answers to all my questions? Aagh! All these are giving me headaches...      Maybe I should just live my life out in ignorance, like many others... who have sunk deep down in the rabbit's fur, and had the wool pullen over their eyes...

       HOMEWORK!!! I'm currently stuck in my friend's house doing the bloody project Mr Cheng gave!!! And I am the one doing all the donkey work!    I hate the English project, and the teacher along with it...    I still have a lot of homework... is this a holiday or what? I'm buried under a heap of work, I can't even enjoy myself!    And I really dislike Jia Ying... she is that annoying... Geez... I swear, that girl needs to GET A LIFE!!! She really irks me with all her phone calls! I really regret giving her my number... Can I sue her for harrasment? I wonder how her family stands her.... I would have killed her by then...     My mother is also equally irritating... she likes to complain about me; how I always don't listen to her, don't do my work, keeps on playing, how I don't talk to other people much...    God! That woman is seriously crazy! What's wrong with not doing my work now? It's the holidays!    Anyway, I have to go now... must finish project... By the end of the holidays, i probably will become a ZOMBIE!!!

       You know, sometimes, life really sucks... my mother annoys the hell out of me, my life is usually filled with countless disasters... why do I even bother to live? Luckily, my fear of death saved me from committing sucide.Yah, I fear, I mean, isn't being afraid of something normal?     I didn't ask to be on this world, but I should learn to live properly... I should stop thinking about dying... I probably read too much angsty books...    I tried using the tarot as a way to hlp me straighten out all my thinking, and yeah, it did work!     Life is usually full of complications, but I should just accept this bloody life... because I'll be stuck with it till I die... which should be at least 70 years more...

       I think my title is a lyric from some Dido song, right?           But anyway, today   is   the best day of my life! Who can ask for better friends than Amirah, Mandy, Chin Ming, Atiqah and Aishah? No one!       Although my birthday has already gone by, or if you prefer, haven't come, they had given me so many surprises today!  They came here to celebrate my birthday today! And they ordered pizza! But the best time were the presents. Atiqah got me a rainbow colored star keychain from Gifts D'Lite, while all five of them chipped in to buy me a Marik Structure Deck! Oh, I just loved them all!!! Aishiteru, my friends!!! Not in a gay way though, get your mind out of the gutter, Eva!     Aishah's birthday is on August 7th, we should start preparing too... hmm, I wonder what she would like, maybe a CD? Or some romance books?     I know Chin Ming wants a Yuna model, I think we can all contribute some money to buy it. Amirah, Mandy and Atiqah, I think they'll like sweets and chocolate. Mandy especially wants chocolates from the Cocoa Tree...    I'm soooo full, due to the pizza! Awww, I have to do my homework now... WAIT!!!! I still haven't told my mom about my English Common Test grades!!! MOM!!!!

         Alright!!!   1A roxs!! We won the IFD, and the prize is $300!! Cheque!!! OMG!! It  was a really fun night, with the whole school dancing...   Mr Cheng's traditional costume is totally funny! Hilarious, I must say.  I burst out laughing when I saw him. Haizzz, that was kind of mean of  me... afterall, Mrs Clark said that we should have compassion... so I  won't make such snide comments, but I'll think it in my mind quietly...  Haizzz...I have to sleep now..now Evalyn can use the computer. Not fair..but never mind.

       IFD basically stands for 'International Folkdance". The IFD night is coming soon, infact, it's the 16th of July! u_u... I'm gonna make a big fool out of myself... Haizzz...     Izzaty and Ellysa are the ones in charge of making the costumes, and I think they are using GARBAGE BAGS as the materials for our clothes!!! EWWWW!!! I don't wanna wear plastic bags! If they need to use recycled materials, why can't we just use old cloths and sew everything together?! Idiotic!     I think Eva's free on Friday night... I'm thinking of asking her to go in my place... Do you think she'll want to? Nah, she won't... so, I'll have to go! Poor poor Faizal... having me as his partner... I really pity him... He has to like cue me in for a lot of steps, coz I just can't be bothered to remember. Hey! There's sooooo many things in my brain... the wicca stuffs, not to mention, my own studies, how can I care about some lame dance? Not important on my agenda.    It's 10pm, my mother wants me to sleep... sometimes, I really dislike parents, ordering us all around. Being a kid is sooooooooo NOT FUN! You have to go to school, be expected to pass all sorts of crappy tests and exams, and be compared with other kids!     Honestly, why can't kids just be themselves, do the things they really want to do, instead of being forced into something? I mean, if the kid wants to be a mother tongue teacher, why does the kid have to learn all sorts of complicated mathematics formulas? The person won't even be needing it much in his/her later life! Ridiculous! The person just needs the basic skills, like, the four operations, maybe some percentage, decimals, and fractions. They don't really need formulas to solve algebraic questions, because their profession has simply no use for it!    She's nagging at me AGAIN! Why???? FINE! I go! AND WASTE MY TIME OFF IN THE DREAM LAND! I swear that I won't fall asleep...(sandman enters, throw sand.) I wo..n't... ... fa..ll... a..sleep... ZZZZZZ....

       I'm so tired, so weary of this life, of everything. The world, its people. I just want to be free. Yes, I want to go to the Free Country, a world without adults, a world where children can be free to do what they want, what they like. It's a world especially for children. No pain, no hatred, no anger, no threats. Nothing, just freedom.  You may think that we are free now, but think again. No! We are bound, by ties of loyalty, work, friendship, kinship. That is no freedom!  This world now bores me. Maybe, if I die, I'll be able to get to there. What more should I want? The Free Country will porvide for its children. Whatever they want, she will conjure up.  This world has lost its magic; the people have turned to rely on science and technology. They have forgotten the ancient magic that binds us to this world.  I'm sick and tired of everything. I nned a rest. Feelings are like a gust of wind to me. It comes and goes, and leaves no traces. I have just noticed, that I have never really felt happy before. Honest. I can't remember anything happening to me that makes me truly glad. I think I'll be dead by now if I come face to face with dementors; I won't be able to do the Patronous charm thing.  It's like everyday, something has to make me angry or sad. I have such limited feelings. Yeah, I laugh, but I'm not happy. I'm just amused; by the antics of people, sunken deep in the rabbit's fur. I'm laughing. At them. Their foolishness, their so dull life. Pity.  I feel so dark and depressed. So gloom filled. I'm cold inside, there's like a cold rain pouring in my heart.  I can't feel much now. I'm numbed. Empty. Dead. Seriously, I doubt that I have ever been alive. Yeah, life doesn't really suit me. huh, I can't hardly feel my pulse, but it's still there. I'm still living. What a newsflash. Hahahahaha...how ridiculously funny. Hahahahahahahahahaha

       for my computer... Hell, I'm seriously pissed off, to put it mildly. It crtashed again!! Can you believe it??!! Grr! You know, it's iriitating the way my luck has been going. First I lose my watch, then my water bottle. And now, the computer has to go off and BLOW UP!! Now I can't post any more stories, not with my limited time on the computer... haizzz  Anyway, I've better start preparing for Aishah's birhtday. Atiqah and Amirah said that she wanted either a samurai girl book, or a date with her crush.. uh-uh, I am not going to be match maker for anybody. v_v... no way! Hell, I don't even know how to get a date with a guy, let alone how to help my friend got one! The way I'll probably do it will be : getting up to him, hold a chopper right up to his throat and threaten "If you don't go on a date with my friend Aishah, you'll be a head shorter..." Lol... what would he think? That's we're all psychos?? Probably, and cart us off to the loony bin.  Anyway, there's still time. Maybe we'll just buy her the book. Oh well.  Now back to my computer! Seriosuly, I''m grousing a lot on my blog, don't I? When will my brother fix it????  I just found out a cool japanese bnd recently: Dir en Grey. Yeah, I know it's been on since like a long time ago, but I just saw it not long. They're a bit punkish and kind of goth like, but still pretty cool.
