      Yesterday, I did a cycle/run brick. 36 min(15 km) bike followed immediately by 1 mile on the treadmill. I also went to physio for my back again. I hadn't gone in about 2 months. When I started running more often, my back started acting up again(did I already mention that?).  I also biked 15km home.  Today, I cycled to work and after work I swam for 33 minutes(about 850 m, I think) followed immediately by my ride home. I wore the wetsuit while swimming to get used to it. I think it is a little small. One of the members at the gym told me that I could borrow her wetsuit. She is doing the Ironman Canada in 3 weeks(wow!!) So, I am going to try out her suit in the lake next week, and hopefully it fits!!  Tomorrow, I have a wedding to go to, so no workouts.

      I am absolutely thrilled right now. This is not triathlon related but it is fitness related. I have been wanting to get my pre-post natal fitness certification, seeing as I already teach a post-natal fitness class, but the instructor who teaches it is pregnant again, and is not able to teach it. I recieved a phone call this morning, and was told that I was referred to the organization as a possible trainer to teach the certification course!! How cool is that??? That opens a few more career doors to me.

      Well, my first triathlon is in 11 days!!!  I am doing the sprint distance at Lake Chapparel.  I am so excited and nervous at the same time. I love being able to tell people that I am training for a tri because it amazes the shit out of everyone and it makes me feel really good.  I started training about 8 weeks ago(I think).  A girl from work had just finished her first sprint triathlon, and when I found out that she had just learned how to swim this spring,  I thought "If she can do it, so can I".  At that point, I hadn't swam laps in about 20 years. God that makes me sound so old.  The last time I did laps was for my Bronze Medallion in swimming when I was 16 yrs old. I also hadn't ran in a long time either. Since my dd was born 3 yrs ago, I have had issues with my deep core muscles as well as my IT band and gluteus medius that made it painful to run.   The good news is that I now can run 5 km(33 minutes on the treadmill), swim750 metres, and cycle 20 km. Now to put it all together.  I did try a couple of brick workouts this past week:  On Saturday, I cycled 15 km followed immediately by 1 mile of running. No problem!! I think that is because I barely make it to work on time most days and I break into a run to get into the building, down the hallway and up the stairs. I didn't realize that I had MONTHS of brick workouts under my belt already LOL.  Yesterday, I cycled 15 km followed immediately by 20 minutes of swimming. Kind of backwards, but I did it.  Also, last night was my last weight training session before my tri. I have been doing a full body weight workout 1-2 x week the last couple of months.  Today is a well deserved and needed day off.
