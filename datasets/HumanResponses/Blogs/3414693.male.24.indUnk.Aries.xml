      Played golf again today...  Got to play 3 times over the last 4 days. Thats a nice little holiday weekend. The only problem with today's game was that it FREAKING POURED for about 20 minutes. Had to hide under some trees on the course. Of course, I was soaking wet. And as soon as the sun came out, it turned REALLY REALLY muggy.  Still, a day of golf is better than a day doing pretty much anything else.  Back to work tomorrow. It's going to be rough waking up early again (after sleeping in for 3 days)

      The law of averages came through for me tonight. After an awful movie a couple nights ago, I finally watched a good one tonight.   I went out trying to find "Man on the moon" a couple days ago, and to my dismay... it wasnt available for purchase. Megan was with me and convinced me to buy "The Life Of David Gale" instead. Tonight, after my day of golf, I watched it on DVD.   It was great.

      Do not pay 7 bucks to see  The Day After Tomorrow ...  as a matter of fact, dont pay 5, 3, or 1. It was the worst movie I have ever watched in a theatre. Until tonight (fri), the worst movie experience was A.I. That is no longer.   It SUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKED.

      At the bottom of each little entry, you can make comments. I have set up the account where you can write without having to subscribe. So just click the Anonymous link and write whatever you want.   sometimes, Ill answer them here..  "Anonymous said... Does Megan find it weird that you talk about your relationship with her on the air?"  - Sometimes she has a problem with it. Most times she doesnt. When we first started dating it was a much bigger deal than it is now. It's got to be weird to  1)  have your boyfriend on the radio and  2)  hear him share his and your personal life together. She has adjusted and realizes that I make my living by talking about things happening around the world  AND  to me. She is a champ about it now. However, when she gets really mad about it, she lets me know.

      My stupid fire alarm (and everyone elses) went off for 45 minutes today. Apparently my apt complex sends fire marshalls out to make sure they all work...at the same time.    Monday June 14th is the  Who's The Boss  marathon on Nick At Nite! I love that show. Glad its back on the channel. Other quality shows from my childhood include...  1) Wonder Years 2) Fresh Prince 3) Full House 4) Perfect Strangers 5) Family Matters 5)  The Cosby Show  6) Hangin' With Mr Cooper 7) Saved By The Bell 8) Family Ties 9) ALF 10)Growing Pains

      I came upon this Blog website while searching for "Andy Kaufman Returns" stories. I am a huge fan of Andy and hoped it was true. http://andykaufmanreturns.blogspot.com  So, let's see if I keep with this hobby (writing this) as I did some of my other short lived ones. I have tried balloon animals, running, knitting, building websites, and playing the harmonica...None lasted over a couple weeks.

      I have a new pet peeve...  It bothers me when I call someone, who I know has my name and number saved in their cell phone, and they answer like they have no idea who is calling.   If I am calling one of my good friends, or even Megan, I expect a personalized greeting.   Not "hello?"

      Dear Bobby Bones Show Crew,  Let me start by saying how much I enjoy listening to you guys in the morning,you all work great as a team together.  Bobby, Jill, and LB each bring a different dynamic to the show.  Bobby has his crazy stories, Jill is often a voice of reason and prudence, and LB is the ever-reluctant, but at the same time willing guinea pig for morning entertainment.  I really enjoy listening to you all in the morning.  But as of lately I haven't been able to listen to you all in the morning,which is where I was hoping you could help me.  In the mornings, I work out at the Texas State Rec Center, where until lately I listened to the Bobby Bones show as I worked out (it was broadcast on the Rec PA).  This is the only time I can listen to your show, since I have class at 1100. Your show puts me in a good mood as I work out, which is another reason I enjoy it.  Well recently the Rec Staff has changed the radio station in the weight room to this terrible radio station called 93.3/99.7.  This morning radio station is awful and a lot people that work out in the morning don't like it. For instance every morning they play this terrible version of the new D12/Eminem song in which the DJs make up there own song and try to lay down some words to D12's beats.  I can't even describe how bad this song is  and they do it every morning!!!  I often turn off the volume when this song is played and people thank me when I do it.  But then the Rec staff comes in and turns it back up. I have also complained about it to them, but was told it was voted on by the Rec users.  This isn't true since I work out every day and never saw anything about voting on radio stations to listen to.  They also have a ghetto version of LB called Squeaky.  Squeaky can't even compare to LB, LB is better in every way.  Once to be hard on Squeaky for something bad he did, they made him smell lemonade on the street corner.  LB would scoff at such a venture, and that's the worst that Squeaky has gone through.  They also do other annoying things like the "Hot Girl Check-In" and the "Bitter-EX Check-In."  I and most the people working out really don't like listening to this station and was wondering if you all could use some DJ clout to get the Texas State Rec Center to play 96.7 in the morning.  The only reason they play this station is because a few of the staff like it.  But we all shouldn't have to suffer for the sake of a few staff.  I know you guys are busy and probably have more important things to do, but I and the Texas State morning work out crew would deeply appreciate your help in getting them to stop playing this station.  Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and keep up the good work Bobby, Jill, LB, and of course all the supporting staff that make the show possible.  Sincerely, JF  - Dear JF  It will be taken care of soon.  Your friend, Bobby

      - I found my freaking rat. The tail of the sucker was poking out behind my tv. Believe it or not, It was still alive.  So, now its back in its cage... Thank God.  - We won another softball game tonight. We beat the best team in the league by a few runs. The coolest part of the night was that Greg Swindell played ball with us. In case you arent familiar, Greg played in the Major Leagues for 17 years. He was an All Star. He also won a World Series in 2002.   Greg is a listner to our radio show and called in to donate some money to a underprivalaged baseball team we are helping. We thought it would be funny to ask him to play with us. Oddly enough, he accepted and will play with us for the rest of the season.  - I am going to the sneak preview of Spider Man 2 tomorrow at 11am. Should be pretty decent movie.

      - We had a sneak preview of the movie "Dodgeball", tonight. It was freaking hilarious. Usually the dumb comedies make the same "fart" joke over and over, you accept it for that, and then leave the theatre feeling dumber than when you went in. Not the case with Dodgeball. It gets 4 stars.  - Our radio station dodgeball tournament is Saturday morning. Watching the movie made my anticipation even stronger. I cant wait to play. Kind of like when I was a kid and would watch the Rocky movies. After the movies, I would be so motivated to start a boxing career, that I would pounce my little sister for about an hour. We even bought gloves. Usually after 5 minutes she would get a fat lip and start crying, but it was always fun. She eventually got smart and would hide when Rocky was on.  - Currently on the tube is a WHOS THE BOSS marathon on Nick At Nite. As Jill would say "Hells Yeah!"  - After work tomorrow, I drive to Houston to pick up Megan.  Im ready to get rid of this damn snake.

      - We won our softball game tonight. We thumped some old guys that were pretty good. I think we scored 21 runs in 5 innings. It's a lot more fun to play when you win...  - I had to feed Megan's snake today. Its food? A very small...very cute... mouse. I brought it home after picking it up at the pet store. The snake only eats once a week, so it was ready to pounce on anything that entered the cage. Moments after dropping the helpless mouse into the cage... BAM. The snake devoured it. I have never seen anything like it before.   - I'll be glad when Megan gets back into town.   - So the YMCA called and said they had found my phone. The girl was excited to hand me the silver flip phone that had been stolen. Too bad it was a really old, really broken, black a silver Nokia (not my phone). I was really excited to get my old #s and put them into my new phone.

      I went to get a new cell phone today. My strategic plan was to arrive around 2p, get in, and get out. Being 2 hrs after lunch, and a few hours until the end of the work day, I estimated my total time in store at about 20 minutes.   After 30 minutes of LITERALLY being asleep in a chair, inside the store, they called my name. The store was packed with losers, that like myself, thought it would be the most opportune time to get in.   I found a phone that I liked. However, there was no price tag on the display. I took it to the counter and it rang...350 dollars!!  Before I could slyly slip the phone back to the rack, the ATT girl asked "So, what happened with your old phone?".  "It was stolen"  "From where?", she asked.  "The Freaking YMCA"  And then, she stared at me...  My initial reaction was that my stupid debit card wouldnt go through the computer. She was starting at me because I was trying to buy an expensive phone with zero money.  She kept staring. The look slowly turned into that look your dog gives you when he turns his head in confusion.  "Are you Bobby...from the radio?", she said.  After I said YES, she marked my phone down 70%!!! How freaking lucky is that?  She heard my pitiful story on the air this morning, and felt sorry for me. Thank goodness. That phone was too expensive for me anyway.

      Its 10:20p as I write this...from work. At a time when I would usually be in bed; I am at work trying to cancel my cell phone. You see, I was playing racquetball with a buddy when someone stole my cell phone from the gym. My phone was stolen from the YMCA.  HOW ARE YOU GOING TO STEAL FROM A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE PICTURES OF JESUS ALL OVER THE WALLS?!?!?  I mean, really. It's the freaking YMCA. The C means Christian. Granted, you dont have to be a Christian to be a member, but come on. Steal from a busstop. Steal from a gas station. Dont steal from a place where Jesus' picture is on every wall.  I am pissed.   I can say "pissed". There are no pictures of Jesus around me. If there were, it would be different.   ugh

      So Megan had some personal stuff happen and had to fly back to Atlanta last minute. Because it was so sudden, the airplane ticket was very expensive. She found a ticket for less than half price, but there was a catch...She had to fly out of Houston.   Cue the boyfriend.   We leave Saturday morning about 9am in-route to H-town. Took us about 3 hrs to get there. I dropped her off and had to immediatly drive back 3 hrs for a live broadcast. I was BEAT.   The moral of this story is... Houston is a dump.    Q: you know what's cool? A: finding a 20 dollar bill in your pants pocket that you didnt know you had

      My hairless rats are making my eyes water. I wake up and they are dry. I go to bed and they are watering. And I sneeze all the time.   So, as much as I enjoy their company...I am thinking of getting rid of them. If I let them go...would they survive?  If not, I wont. I will continue my day to day battle with my allergies.

      - I have had a membership to the YMCA for about a year and a half now. Total number of times I have used it...6. I forgot I had it until I looked at my bank statement and noticed that 50 bucks a month has been subtracted for the last 15 months. So, tonight I went to the YMCA.   I used to play racquetball a lot in college. I took it as a phys ed requirement and then enjoyed it so much that I kept playing. I played until, eventually, i got pretty good. Tonight was the first night I had played in almost 2 years. Other than the huge blisters on my feet, all went well. I plan to dominate the local Y league really soon.   - My movie finally came in the mail today. It has taken almost a month, but Best Buy finally sent me "MAN ON THE MOON". I'm very excited to watch it.   Megan also bought me a movie called "The Big Lebowski". She knows my love for well written comedies and was shocked that I had never seen it. I'm sure I'll watch it this weekend while all the cool hipsters are out on the town.   I am a 24 year old hermit.

      As a human, I must maintain growth of different body areas containing hair. I am not embarrassed to say that I shave my face (everyday), chest (occassionaly if I have to have my shirt off somewhere), the back of my neck, and even my armpits at times.   I took the electric razor to the ol pits and now I have freaking razorburn under my arm.   In case you care or want the visual... its the left arm.

      Long weekend...  -  Friday night , I did the fashion show. You can see the pictures if you go to www.bobbybones.com and go to the photo section. They straightened my curly hair to give me more of a "slick" model look. My hair is so curly that they had to iron it 4 times in 2 hrs.        We were forced to be there at 3p and the show didnt start until almost 10p! About 4 hrs into it, they fed us "dinner". It consisted of a few grapes and a cracker. Lunchbox and I looked like fools when we were stacking up plates. We needed hot wings and pizza.      We learned how to do all the walking stuff at 3p and then just waited around for hours. I was so restless by the end of the night. Kinda cool though..Some of the people there were Sandra Bullock, Keanu Reeves, Dennis Quaid, Steven Dork, Frankie Muniz, Greg Kinnear, and a lot of others.       At the end of the night, there was a big after party. I was so tired that I went straight home and went to bed. However, Lunchbox went and got HAMMERED (of course).   -  Sunday (today), I arrived at the golf course around 7:45. LB and I were playing a celebrity tournament at Avery Ranch Golf Course. Sadly, we didnt get to play together. My tee time was at 9:50. I played with 2 NFL players. One former NFL player, Dallas Cowboy, and Hall Of Famer... Ed "too tall" Jones. He was 6'10 and over 300 lbs. My other partner was a player from the Houston Texans. He was 6'6, 305 lbs. Needless to say, my 6'0, 170 lb self looked invisible. They both were CRUSHERS too. They hit the ball really hard and far everytime.        There were big galleries of people watching the game. I hit INTO them a few times. It was quite interesting watching people scatter as your ball screams toward them.   - Now its 10:16, on Sunday night and I am exhausted. I am watching the Lakers and Pistons and ready to crash. Megan left with my car about 9p and I havent seen her since. Who knows where she is?!?!

      - After many emails, I have finally posted a picture of Megan. Its up at www.bobbybones.com  Let me say (because she is making me) that it's not a "good picture" of her. I have also promised to take it down pretty soon.   I have also said for sometime now that Megan looks just like Simon Cowell's girlfriend (model Terri Seymour). There is a poll up on the page... or you can just write down in the  response  part of the page.  Ok, now leave me alone about it...  - I am just back from the gym. I try hard to work out 4 times a week to stay in decent shape. The only problem is...  I eat like crap . I had 16 hot wings, 3 pieces of pizza, 2 sodas, and a pudding snack.   but I did go to the gym?!

      Looks like I'll get no time to post on here this evening... So I'll do it from work. Right now its 10:22am and I am killing a little time before my 11am meeting with the show.   We'll do that until around 12:30, then I am off to the bank and Texas Laser Cosmetics with Megan to do some commercial stuff.   Speaking of my bank... It sucks. Its so far North and its the only one in Austin. I have yet to get it on the direct deposit phenomenon sweeping the nation.   Ill be at the Cosmetics place with Megan until around 3p, and then its off to court with Lunchbox.   I hate sitting in a stupid court room for 3 hrs waiting to get called up to see if you have to pay the ticket. The last time I was at a courthouse, i was waiting for 6 hrs. I hope that's not the case tonight...  Our softball game is at 8:20 at Kreig Field (Pleasant Valley Rd in S Austin). We are playing Jill's boyfriends team... so this is as close to a rivaly game as there is. If we dont win, Ill be angry.  That makes for a long day. Ill probably be at the softball field until 10.   Waking up at 3:45 sucks.  --- I dont know how to load a picture of Megan on this site. I will try again tomorrow. The requests are mounting, and I dont mind putting one up... I just dont want to have to pay for the "premium blogger" to have the picture function.

No American Idol tonight... bummer.   Tomorrow, I am supposed to get a facial. A client at work wants me to talk about it, so they asked if I would go through with it....

      People are writing that they want Megan to respond or speak out on certain things. So, too appease a bunch of you, I told her she could write on today's blog.   and now a few words, unedited, from Megan... ---------  I almost feel like I don’t need to respond since it seems you all know me so well already. Almost…  To those of you who were not rude in your comments, THANK YOU. To those of you with the snide judgements, that’s your opinion. Whatever.  I find it a little comical that people get wrapped up in a relationship they only hear about on air, a relationship that has the same ups and downs as most. However, some of you seem to make this one’s downs out to be much worse. It’s not easy hearing your personal business talked about on air, but when I got into this relationship I knew I was getting into that as well. So, I have no complaints. Keep the comments coming-good and bad.  I know I don’t need to defend my relationship to any of you, but since Bobby gets to put in his opinion every morning, here is a little of mine:Yes, Bobby and I fight a lot, maybe more than usual, BUT we get along a lot too. You hear only of the fights. I also know I have my faults. SO does Bobby. You hear only of mine.We would not be together this long if we didn’t care A LOT about each other. You will never hear on air how much I care about him. That’s not entertainment, right? It’s the fights that keep you up before 10am…   Megan ------

      - I have been swamped with work this week. I will perform at our station concert "The Next Big Thing" tomorrow (thurs night). I am only doing this because the bosses didnt think that Maria Mena would draw enough to the venue. I understand their concern, being that she only has one song and noone really knows who she is yet. I also see the financial risk being taken.   At the same time, the whole concert is billed "The Next Big Thing", which means the premise is that noone knows who she is...   So,&nbsp;I'm not fully prepared to play. I pick up my guitar in spurts and have written a couple funny songs, but I dont even have them memorized yet.&nbsp; I also havent been on stage singing in a while.  It is a free show at 7p, so I encourage everyone to come and show a little support. Also, we have agreed to allow CRAZY ALLEY to do 5 min of stand up comedy. In case you arent familiar with the show, she is&nbsp;a crazy ass caller that calls everyday.   - There are a lot of new pictures up on our main page  urlLink www.bobbybones.com  today. There is even a newer one of Megan, in case you want to match a name with a face.   - No indepth analysis of life at the moment. I am still at work and I feel guilty when I neglect this blog.   - Ill answer and questions that you have regarding me, megan, the show, jill, lunchbox, the station, etc, in a new weekly segment called&nbsp;BOBBY'S BLOG MAILBAG (which is much like the mailbag we do on the show, which is much like the David Letterman mailbag...). Write your question in the comments section down below.

      I am kind of pressed for time as I write this, but...  if you look at yesterday's blog, and the comments made underneath it; you will see that Megan responded to someone comment.  It's rare that she makes a public comment...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      - I went to Taco Bell for some lunch today. I pulled up to the window and ordered the usual 5 crunchy tacos.    "Sorry sir, we are out of beef"    Unbelieveable.  Is&nbsp;Blockbuster&nbsp; out of videos? Sears fresh out of tires? or&nbsp;Payless&nbsp;all out of tennis shoes?&nbsp;  There was a 7/11 very close, so I stopped to see if they had anything quick for lunch. Oddly enough their little deli fresh sandwiches are really good.   - I was supposed to go see John Mayer/Maroon 5 tonight, but Megan couldnt go at the last minute. So we stayed home. I was very disappointed.   &nbsp;

      My dad is over 45 years old and have never been on an airplane.   I am flying him into Austin from Arkansas&nbsp;in late August to watch the Cubs vs Astros in Houston.&nbsp;He doesnt act like it, but I know deep down he is very nervous.   At age 24, I have never...   Been to a strip club  Swam in the ocean (have been, but it was way too cold)  Drank coffee  Been in a car accident (knock on wood)  Been arrested  said "I L--- You" to any female not in my family Been to L.A.   I'm sure there are more, but Megan is about to be over here. I havent seen here in a while, and she gets annoyed when I stay on the computer as she sits right beside me.   Feel free to join in the "I've never" game...

      I miss my girlfriend.   Megan is taking 6 hrs of Italian during this summer session so she can graduate soon. I am not exaggerating when I say that she has to study for 5-6 hrs a night. What went from spending most nights together eating dinner, watching tv, and just hanging out...has went to&nbsp;0 hours.   I havent spent more than 30 minutes&nbsp;total&nbsp;with her in the last 4 days.   I can almost relate. I graduated with a French minor, you see. Foreign language was VERY tough for me. It would be a lie to say that I went to college to learn foreign language. However, my degree entailed 12 hrs of it, and since I only had to take 1 more year of classes after that to get a minor: I decided that I would.   Mistake.   First off all, I had&nbsp;a hard time with beginning French. I was the only one who hadnt taken a lot of it in high school. When it was time to speak it aloud, frankly, I was embarrassed. I passed it with a C.   Same for my second semester. C.  Third semester, hard fought C.  Fourth semester, harder fought C.   (Note: these were the only C's I made in college. I was a good student with a high GPA, I just couldnt defeat conjugating those french verbs)   I only passed the last year, and got my minor, because the teacher thought I was cute.  He  was a weird guy. But, you take what you can get, I guess.   Back to my original thought. If I had that much trouble taking 3 hrs a semester, I can only imagine how hard it would be to take 6 hrs in a month. Thats a lot of cramming.   I am ready for things to get back to normal.    72

      Softball night is Wendesday night. And because of this, it is under strict orders at work to schedule me for absolutely nothing.   I was sitting in my apt today around 3p when I got a call asking if I wanted to come play later that evening.&nbsp;I didnt really know the guys on the team, but they had seen me play before and got my information/phone #s from the softball office (because I am the coach of our team and all the coach's numbers are public). I, of course, accepted and got the ball field about 6:30 for the 7:00 game. The guys recognized me and we proceeded to warm up.   &nbsp;These guys were really good. This was the Upper Division (the league full of the best players). Usually we play in the middle league.   I expected to play one of the weaker spots in the field, either right field or catcher. My reasoning was that I didnt pay to play with these guys and they just needed someone to fill in, so I'd play one of the worst positions.   I played shortstop for these guys.   Now, I am lefthanded and its not common for&nbsp;a lefty to play the position. More than I wanted to play  well , I just didnt wants to  blow the game  for the team. For the first time in many moons, I was nervous to play slow pitch freaking softball...   Luckily, I played lights out in the field. I played way over my head and these guys think I can actually play a little. Well, i can play a little...just not a lot.   They asked me to come back and play with them everyweek.   Now Tuesday's and Wednesday's are softball nights.

      - Man, it&nbsp;was great to be back on the air this morning. I am glad&nbsp;I have a job that I dont hate. My dad didnt have that luxury. He was/is a mill operator at home. Which meant he went in early, stayed late, and labored hard. My dad worked hard to give us all he could...but hated his job.  &nbsp;  Being away from work, not knowing if I was going to return, really made me appreciate the fact that I love what I do.   I am glad to be back. Even if I do have to wake up at 4am...  &nbsp;  - Played golf today after work. Lunchbox, Barry the Producer, Steve-O, Greg Swindell and myself all played today. It was a lot of fun, even though none of us are as good as Greg. Atleast I beat LB and Barry.  &nbsp;  - People like to prank call radio stations. I did it . People do it to me now. However, if you want to prank a station... have a purpose.  &nbsp;  My challenge for whoever is reading this&nbsp;is to call the  other  radio stations around Austin, trick the phone screener into thinking you are going to talk about the topic being discussed, and then&nbsp;try to fit in THE BOBBY BONES SHOW into your&nbsp;time on the air. Say the name of our show on a different station. It will PISS THEM OFF and everyone will get a good laugh.   You will feel more satisfied with your call. There will have been a purpose.&nbsp;Then call us and let us know you&nbsp;got&nbsp;on&nbsp;another station...&nbsp;&nbsp;

      The decision has been made.  &nbsp;  First off all, I'd like to thank every single person who sent in an email to the bosses at Kiss Fm and Clearchannel Radio. The overwhelming response, both positive and negative, is a large reason the bosses even considered the notion of not terminating us.  &nbsp;  Secondly, if anyone was offended by our stunt...I apologize.   Thirdly...   We'll see you Monday morning!   The Bobby Bones Show returns...thank God.  &nbsp;  I encourage you to call in and share your feelings with us. Good, bad, etc...   I have re-enabled the "response" part of the page. So feel free to voice your pleasure or displeasure with the decision put forth by our bosses.  &nbsp;  WE WILL BE BACK MONDAY MORNING!

      as I write this, it is half passed noon. Also, as I write this, I have no indication as of the status of The Bobby Bones Show.   However, I was told yesterday that I would know something either yesterday or today. So, I am planning on getting a verdict by the end of the day. As soon as I am able to post something on the computer... I will.   I am about to eat lunch and then play golf with Lunchbox. If something were to happen while eating lunch, I will put it here. If it happens while playing golf, I will make another post today around 8:30pm.  Thank you for all the emails. I have recieved so many, and I appreciate every one of them. However, I havent replied to any yet because I dont know anything, period.   So, if you sent an email to me, my bosses, or anyone that works for the company...Know that I have probably read it and really appreciate it.  Support has come from the most odd places. I have recieved emails from other radio stations inside of Austin. These people, who are thought of as competition, have showed their support for us through this really crappy time.   You will hear from me soon.   Hopefull the news will be good.  your friend, B

      Commentary: John Kelso Stupid DJ tricks par for the course              AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF  Friday, July 9, 2004  Today I'm starting the movement to get Lunchbox his job back. Print up the bumper stickers. "Forget the Whales. Save Lunchbox."   If there's ever a guy who got a raw deal, it's Lunchbox, the disc jockey who got suspended from KISS 96.7 FM here in Austin for doing his job.   One of the requirements for being a morning DJ at your standard American radio station is to make a complete fool of yourself on a daily basis. This is why DJs are always dropping pigs out of airplanes, getting on-the-air vasectomies, or, like Lunchbox, walking into stores in 90-degree weather with masks over their heads to see what the clerk will do.   Besides, they didn't call this guy Lunchbox over at the station for nothing.   On Wednesday, Austin police arrested Lunchbox, 22, whose real name is Dan Chappell, and charged him with making a terroristic threat, a Class A misdemeanor. In a radio station gag that got way out of hand, a masked Lunchbox walked into a convenience store on South Congress Avenue and bought a pack of gum.   His intent was to see how the clerk would react, then and report back to the station via cell phone.   Go ahead and call Lunchbox a knucklehead if you want. But at least he paid for the gum, right?   Lunchbox's troubles began when Atif Akhlaque, the clerk, thought Lunchbox was about to rob him and pushed the alarm. You can't blame Akhlaque. What is he supposed to think when some clown comes in with a mask over his head? "Oh, never mind. It's just another stupid radio guy." Anyway, so the police nabbed Lunchbox.   Meanwhile, the station has suspended Lunchbox, who was just trying to jack up the station's ratings and help it make a buck. Is this fair? Since DJs are hired to do this sort of thing, why isn't station management being held accountable, too?   I think we here at the newspaper are a little too quick to snicker at disc jockeys for their silly behavior. Frankly, I'm a little jealous. Not that I haven't pulled some of my own dumb stunts for this column.   I think one of my finest moments was the time I decided to make fun of Barney the Dinosaur by walking into an Eckerd in a Barney suit to buy a package of condoms.   So Lunchbox and I have much in common. And there isn't a disc jockey worth his microphone who can't tell you about the time he painted himself as a complete idiot to attract listeners.   Take Bob Cole, the morning man at KVET-FM, who took Viagra on the air when it first came out to see what would happen.   "Nobody knew anything about it then; it was brand-new," the scientifically curious Cole explained.   Shifting the blame, Cole says he got the Viagra from his co-host, Sammy Allred. "Sammy was the guy who had gotten the sample of it, and he was afraid to try it, and I said, 'Well, give me one,' " Cole recalled.   This seems like it should be a TV stunt and not a radio one. But what do I know? I'm strictly a print guy.   John Kelso's column appears on Sundays, Tuesdays and Fridays. Contact him at 445-3606 or jkelso@statesman.com.

      I am very competitive.   I am more competitive than you.  More brutal than any softball game, golf tournament, or Middle East oil war is something we call GAME NIGHT. A bunch of friends come over and we break out the Trivial Pursuit.   I am very competitive.   So are my friends.  It is ON from the moment the board is opened. Any word you shouldnt say in mixed company is said...over and over again. Everyone is out for blood and everyone is there to win.   We teamed up tonight in teams of 2. Jill had one of the pen pals (from england) on her team. Our promotions director Jennifer and Lunchbox were on a team (probably the strongest all around pair). My girlfriend Megan and Stephanie (promotions director for 104.3) were on a team. On my team was the pen pal from France.   The game started at 7:30, and by 8:00 hardly anyone would speak to an opposite team member without cursing them. Pie by pie, the game continued. Dice roll, by dice roll the pressure and intensity mounted. Hatred grew by the minute.  Finally, 9:00 came. Two teams were full of pies and trying to land in the center. Those teams... The girl pen pal and myself, and Jennifer and Lunchbox.   We roll a 4. Its time for the middle spot. Its time to win the game. Its time to rub it in...if we can get it right.  Q: South Park's Cartman sang this 70's Styx anthem on the first South Park Album.  Our Answer: Sail Away.  And that's the ballgame!  Noone would talk. The board game was packed up. My apartment was slowely evacuated. Everyone will probably all be a little bitter about it tomorrow.    I love gamenight.     (sidenote: I am undefeated at Game Night)

      Three day weekends are always gold...  A quick recap   Saturday  - The head of our sales department was married on Saturday. Megan couldn't go because she had to work, so I attended the wedding with two friends from work. It was in a church, and just like old times...I was sitting on one of the back pews.   The ceremony had reached the peak of solemnity. Everyone was quiet. The church may have even been in prayer. Just as it could get no more still...  RINNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG  Straight ahead, one pew up, a lady is scrambling like a snake was in her pants. However, it was worse. She left her cell phone on during the wedding!  RIIIINNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG  And this wasnt a regular ring. It was a John Phillip Souza - Stars and Stripes Forever - The Saints Come Marching In - High School Trumpets a Blazing - Clown Juggling - Traffic Jam  ring. (note: the ring was loud and busy)  RIIIINNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG  She finally found it and turned it off. By this time, I was laughing (under my breath) so hard that I couldnt couldnt breathe. I hadn't had the giggles since I was in church at age 9. Hilarious.   - Well I am tired of writing now. Here is the brief recap of the rest of the weekend.  Megan left her email open at my apt. I checked it (like an idiot) and found stuff that made me mad. Went to Pat Green Concert. Watched fireworks with Megan. Attempted to go to casino in Louisianna. Fought with Megan about what was in her email. Stayed in Austin. Went Kayaking on town lake with Megan on Sunday. Spent too much money at the mall. Bought Groceries.   With each of those different events, there is a story. Maybe one day I'll get to them.

      - Saw Spiderman on Opening night (wed night). I didnt think it was as good as the original. Too much love. Not enough spidey ass kicking.   - If you have AOL or AOL IM, Lunchbox's screenname is DcCubs17 . Dont tell him where you got it.   - I wake up around 3:50 every morning. Most days (today), the first thought in my head is "I can't wait to take a nap".

      Its 7:30 on Tuesday night and I have plopped myself down in front of the TV to watch Little league baseball. It's almost the time of the year for the Little League World Series. Although I never got far enough in my little league tournaments to play on TV, these games always make me feel young again.  I didnt have a lot money growing up. My family could never afford to go on fancy vacations or even unfancy road trips in the summer. My mom was raising my little sister and myself while she worked 2 different jobs. Needless to say, I didnt have her around as much as I would have liked.  I did have baseball. It's all I did every summer from ages 8 to almost 18.  I loved it and it didnt take a lot money to play. I would save enough cans or mow enough yards to buy a new left handed Spalding baseball glove before every summer started. Never would I oil the glove. I would go in the back yard and just throw the ball straight up in the air until it was broken in.  The season would start soon after school ended. Lucky for me, the baseball field was in bike riding distance from my house. I would put the glove on the side of the handlebars and go to the field every day. I wasnt the best ball player for a lot of my early youth. I wasnt even that good. Maximum, i was 4'10 and around 85 lbs while everyone else was inches and lbs larger. I didnt care, I just loved to play. It wasnt until I was about 15 years old (and finally started to grow) that I started to be average, and then an above average ball player. All the same, I loved to play baseball.  By the time I was 18, I has amassed a lot of awards and even some (very) small college attention. I wisely decided that I wasnt good enough to ever make a career out of playing baseball. Besides I had just started working in radio and knew it was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  More sad than my graduation, or getting dumped by my first girlfriend in highschool, was my last game as an organized baseball player. We were creamed in the State Quarter Finals. I wasnt sad because we lost, but because I knew I would never dawn a baseball uniform again.  It was the one consistent thing that I had growing up. Regardless of problems at home or at school, I could always go throw the baseball around and make the worries disappear, even if just for a few hours.  I still have a couple of my old gloves.  I also have a new one ...and a softball game in 2 hrs.

      First of all,  Something is wrong with my blog.  1- It takes me 10 times logging in to actually get into the admin area. I have to log in over and over before it allows me to post.  2- I cant turn the comments on. I dont know why. I assume that it has something in common with the logging in problem.  3. Every since I changed to the newer version of the Blog, what I like to call Bobby 2.0, there have been a ton of bugs.  I will try to fix them as soon as I can...    Second of all,  I am getting a puppy tomorrow morning. Megan is set to pick it up at 8. The pictures are up at  urlLink www.bobbybones.com  . I really think that I have NO IDEA what I am getting myself into.

      This weekend was the post season softball tournament. Teams from all over the region were coming to Austin to play in a season ending, double elimination, all day softball tournament to find a conclusive "best regional team".  Only the top 2 teams from each division were allowed in the tournament. Needless to say, I had been looking forward to the tournament for a couple weeks. Our team hadn't lost a game in over 2 months and I really thought we would pose a threat to win it all. We came from the last place after losing our first 2 and finished second in our league.  Another reason that I wanted to play, was to get a second shot at Jill's boyfriend's (Reza) team. They won the league over us by  one game  and were the only team that beat us in the regular season that we didnt get a chance to play (and beat) again. We were embarrassed to lose to them and as much as we wanted to win the tournament, we wanted to play them again.  I got to the park early and noted that every freaking team there was full of  ball players . There werent any push around teams. Logically thinking, there wouldnt be any bad teams...since these were the best teams from the surrounding areas. Contrary to them, we were just a bunch of pick up guys from the streets of Compton, Englewood....  I watched Reza's team lose and got ready for our game. We played immediately afterward and also lost. Luckily it was double elimination.  Next, we played a team named the "mercenaries" and proceeded to beat them. Reza's team had already been eliminated, therefore we would not get to play them. Deep down, we were all very disapointed that they lost.  We moved on to the next round and lost in the late innings to a much better team.  The tournament was early, hot, and full of really good softball teams. It would have been more fun had we won a couple more games.  We just wanted to play Reza's team again. Bitterly sweet; we lasted longer in the tournament than they did.  It took me about 6-7 hrs before I wasnt upset after getting eliminated.  I freaking hate to lose.  Megan wont come around me in the hrs following a loss.

      In all of the stupid hoopla about the retiring of the blog, I forgot to mention the ratings for the show. The last ratings period is the highest ratings that we, the Bobby Bones Show, have ever had. We are usually at the top and competing. This last ratings book, we  blew people away .  Since I have nothing to do with the actual rating process (I cant listen), I just wanted to pass a long a big ol thanks to everyone who listens to the show.  I am out for a few days.  later, B

      I have retired that one, to start this one...  Because of the massive amounts of webtraffic on this blog, I have to set a new rule.  - You must be registered to post. It takes 5 seconds to register, and this allows me to ban people if I feel the need. It also eliminates the ability to anonymously post and run. I can check IP addresses now!  I have never deleted anything bad about me or the show. The only post I ever deleted was an unwarranted personal attack on Megan.  This site went from 750 hits a day to over 15,000 hits a day in a 2 month time period. Its way to easy for people from other radio stations to get on here and pimp their station on my site. I dont care if people want to bad mouth me or the show, but I do care when other radio stations are using this a form of their marketing. They need to buy tv time, get their own blog, or (and this is a good one) actually execute a successful radio show.  I appreciate everyone who reads whatever incoherent thoughts I have. It was my vision to use this as a once or twice a week journal to give show information. However, after looking at the webtraffic and hits on each individual submission; that is the least cared about part of the blog. The most read blogs are my retarded thoughts about different personal situations.  Thanks for listening to our little radio show. Without you reading, listening, and caring...I wouldnt be able to buy groceries.  your buddy, Bobby

      I have 2 hairless rats. I often find myself feeling sorry for them.  They are trapped in a glass cage. They depend on me for their food. They drink water out of a tube. Their only real consistant activity is running in the red wheel. They use the bathroom in their cage and wait for me to clean it out.  Or...  They dont have to wake up early in the morning and go to work. They get to be lazy and sleep all day/night. They get their house cleaned for them. They dont have societal pressures to look and act a certain way. There are no rat morals.  Maybe rat life isnt so bad.

      This movie isnt what it seems. If I speak in detail about the movie, it will ruin it. However, I thought it was great.  That being said, you will either love it or hate it. You will either walk out of the theatre in a positive shock or leave very disappointed because you felt mislead.  There were 4 of us on the show this morning who had seen the movie. It was an even 2-2 split on reviews.  2 Loved it. 2 Hate it.

      1. Erica. What happend to her?   Erica left the morning show last month due to staffing issues. However, she didn’t leave the station. She was offered a spot to do her own show on KISS.   2. Did you guys get in trouble with the interview (Rugrats) ?Just curious.It was funny, but I don't want you guys to get into trouble.   We didn’t get in trouble from anyone at the station, but we did get in trouble from the company that schedules the interviews. The agency that gets us a lot of the people you hear us interview was pretty angry at us. As far as I know, they havent void our relationship. But really, whats funnier than hearing someone cuss at a Rugrat? Maybe a rugrat cussing back. But that’s about it.   3. Bobby, you have been dating Megan for almost a year now. Have you ever told her you loved her? We have never heard you say it on the radio. I understand that is private, but thought I would ask.   No, I havent. Next question…   4. When is Lunchbox going to start his blog? Does he know how to use a computer?   Lunchbox working with computers is like me working on my cars engine. We both know what they look like, but no idea how to work them. I don’t think he’ll be blogging soon.   5. Whatever happened to those really quick interviews, I forgot what they were called, "the Gauntlet" maybe, or is that MTV. hahaha. I think my favorite interview was the one with Enrique when they cut it short because Bobby asked about his mole.   We still do them, only we do them as part of our regular interview process. When we first started, we werent getting decent talent/stars to interview on the station. So instead of doing a long, boring, drawn out interview with someone noone cared about, we would do the “gauntlet” interview instead. Now, if we have someone on that we care about, we start it with the guantlet and roll into the rest. If you ever hear us doing an interview without the gauntlet, you can bet we are about to try to mess with that person.   6. What is the latest on the "incident"? Do you think you guys will get into a lot of trouble?   We have been pulled off the air and suspended because of the “incident”. There will be no more enforcement on us as a morning radio show. However, there are still issues with Lunchbox and the legal system. Hopefully, everything will right itself.   7. Whats up Bobby! Great Show.. I was just wondering if your show is ever going to be broadcast online?   Thanks. I wish it were broadcast online. However, there are now laws from the Recording industry that require you to pay for every song broadcast over the internet. When you figure that a music radio station plays thousands of songs a year, you also figure that will cost the radio station some serious money to stream now. I wish there were a way to only stream our show. Since we don’t play the same amount of music in the morning (we talk) as we do the rest of the day, it would be pretty inexpensive. Maybe one day, but probably not.   8. I love your show! When did LB "pass" his balloon?   Good question. Noone knows if he even has… He should have by now, but there has been no “evidence” of it occuring. I keep you posted.   9. I am one of Megan's roommates (one your favorite ones)... Why do you keep telling your listeners/readers that you have never used the L word? Megan keeps telling us that you have told her plenty of times.Do you just try to act cool, or what?   No, you arent. I have checked and Megan’s roommate didn’t write that. Also, at the moment, Megan only has 1 roommate. You wrote that you are one of her roommates (plural), so that blows your cover. And, yes, I just try to act cool and what.    10. Does L.B. have a headset? If not, why doesnt L.B. get a headset to go with his cell phone? And a clip to hold the phone just in case he doesnt have one of those either. This way he doesnt have to struggle with the phone every time he does a stunt. Looks like he is having trouble holding the phone in the pictures posted.   Yes, he has one, but doesn’t like it. He says its too complicated. Refer to question #4.
