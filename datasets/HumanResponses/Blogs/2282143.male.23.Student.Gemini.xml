      Uneventful day today.  Bears won finally.  My dad somehow thinks that we will go to the Tundra and beat the Packers... I say anyone who has seen Farve (spell it like you say it, you creole bastards!) play the Bears, we know its gonna be messy.  I don't care if the Packers go 2-14 for a season, the 2 wins will be against the Bears.  Anyways, if we do somehow kill them, and beat Minnesota who is sucking anyways.... We might even have a playoff chance.  Just being optimistic.  The zoo was fun this weekend.  Nothing beats starting Christmas early, and God knows Christmas is gonna bring mixed feelings this year.  Never got to seeing Two Towers yesterday.  Got too much stuff done that I needed to.  Im just a huge big stress ball.  All my fault really.  But I've been in worse situations before.  I just cant wait for the weekend though, when Im not so stressed, and I spend a fun weekend with the Lodgers and alums in a possibly drunken haze.  Well, probably not, but who knows.  Sammy went home today, which kinda sucked cause we were having a fun weekend.  But two weeks and she will be back, hopefully not as stressed herself, being the end of the semester and all.  Starting to plan big nights for her return... Frontera Grill?  Ohhhh yeahhhhhh.  Rick Bayless is god, and if his restaurant is as good as his recipes in the book, its gonna be a good night.  Oh yeah, anyone have any plans for New Years?  Then a wedding.  I need to call erne or something, I haven't talked to the girl since graduation.  That reminds me... I wonder how Joe is doing?  Damn... I need to work on getting in contact with my college friends better.  Oh well, back to the grind.

      Well, Thanksgiving was a blast, my grandma called in the morning saying that she had been univited to my uncle's so she needed a place to go on Thanksgiving.  So much to my mother's dismay, she came over.  Actually she wasnt too bad.  She wasnt as psycho as she always is, and she kept her mouth shut to my mom, so it worked out ok.  But then I got to go see Sammy's family.  Luke and Chelsea are so damn cute its not even funny.   Went to Tae Kwon Do yesterday for the heck of it.  Nothing was scheduled, but went anyways.  It pays to have a key...  Worked on iron body and staff.  Getting better.  John showed up with the kids, so I got to play tag with his kids for a while, and he taught me some more cool stuff.   Holiday Magic was amazing.  This year, its massive.  Totally decked out.  Grounds must have busted their asses to get it done too.  Beautiful.  Anyways, found out alot more about the wolf incident, unfortunately, in the event anyone from the zoo happens to read this, Im keeping my mouth shut because I dont wanna lose my job over this.  Read the papers if you want any information.  Or IM me...  Well, off to my normal Saturday routine.  Feeling a bit lazy and sore today, so I think TKD is off the menu for my morning activities.  Maybe I can finally settle down and watch the 12 extra hours of the Two Towers on DVD.  Fun times...

      OH I AM EVER SO PISSED!!!!  So yeah, I just wrote the best journal entry ever.  Unfortunately, my internet decided to die as I pushed the post button.  Fuck you internet!  It was great though.  It was undoubtedly the funniest, most philisophical blog I have written.  It would have made you laugh, it would have made you cry.  It would have touched your heart.  It would have touched you in your special place.  Full of emotion, wit, and it ran the full gambit of what makes us human.  Once again, unfortunately, it is gone forever.  I dont think I have the ability to duplicate it.  Sorry kids.  Gotta just deal with this one.  Oh yeah, thats what it was about.  Dealing with things cause life moves too fast to care about the small things that happen.  Maybe I will be inspired tomorrow on Turkey Day... who knows.

      Morning!  Yeah, so yesterday was fun.  Car finally starts around 10:15 Mich time.  Three hour car ride.  Had anxiety attack in the Michigan portion on the way home with nothing but semi's jackknifed in ditches and cars in the nearby forests.  I guess now I kinda have trouble driving in the winter.  PTSD?  I dunno.  So Tae Kwon Do was fun last night.  Lark was back, so that was cool.  I guess she caught viral pneumonia while on the table and was really jacked up for the week.  But she is better now, so thats good.  Tiff's sciatic is messed up and she it putting herself out for 6 weeks... sucks, but you gotta do what you gotta do.  Todd is still nuts.  Saw him banging his head against the wall.  Jack was there, just a normal 17 year old.  Good kid, a bit annoying though.  Complains more than I do.  And as for me, my back is kinda messed up.  I dunno if I have a bruised kidney or what.  Left side, lower, outter is swollen according to Sam and it hurts with pressure and movement.  Couldnt tell ya whats wrong.  Oh well.  Yeah.  John had another good talk last night.  Was doing his usual philosophy that nature is cause and effect and there is no happy or sad.  Dont be stuck on the emotional rollercoaster because good things happen and bad things happen, and we just have to be content with the moment.  He also went into how we should stay in the present moment, and move our lives towards the future we want, but to not plan for that future because you cant really control what is going to happen down the road.  Only the causes and effects of what you do in the present matter.  You had to be there to get the full effect of it.  Anyways, I have to go watch the little one, as usual...

      Oh no... 9 am and I am stuck in Kalamazoo... Sammy left and I told her not to take her cell phone.  Dumb move.  I could have called her to pick me up some gas line antifreeze on her lunch break so I could get home.  No biggie, just an inconvenience.  Thats all.  Piece of crap Nissan.  Guess I just have to wait until the temp goes above 30... like tomorrow.  even then, its only gonna be 40... hehehe.  Oh man...

       urlLink Awww yeah...  Toe tapping...  Thats all I can really describe it as.   So yeah, greetings from beautiful Kalamazoo Michigan.  The reason why I am still here is because I wanted to go to church with Sammy.  I guess she says it wasnt as horrible as it usually is, but any church with a drum kit kicks ass in my mind.  Ok, not really, but its HYSTERICAL!  Dude, who uses a drum kit in church?!?!  I mean, Lamb of God sounded like a slow dance.  All it needed was a little cymbal fade and I would have been all over Sam.  The rest of the music wasnt great.  I mean, it wasnt that the choir of all 5 people wasn't bad, it was just the crappiest music selection I have ever heard.  Odd church overall.  Music was totally nuts, the set up was a bit crazy, and not much of a message to be found.  I would have imagined something along the lines of the crazy email Tom sent Sam about the Catholics need to fight the sin of homosexuality (see post below).  But nothing like that.  I guess thats a good thing, but still the homily wasn't that great.  Yeah, so the set up, it was weird.  Not typical church setup.  No pews, just a bunch of upholstered chairs welded together.  And the room itself reminded me of the barn at Cletus.  Notice how I call it a "barn" if that gives you any idea...  Anyways, the girl in front of us definately wasnt Catholic and when communion starts, she turns to her boyfriend and says "EWWW!  Everyone drinks from the same cup?!?"  That was funny.  Just goes to show you how much different christian religions actually know about each other.  I mean, shoot, I have no fucking clue what anyone else does.  Except Baptist.  Been to a Baptist funeral before.  Tonight was an experience I probably couldn't forget, even if I tried.  I suggest to all of you, try a new parish/church.  You never really know what you're gonna find.   On a different note, I cant believe that in one month its gonna be Christmas and already a year will have gone by without TJ.  I dunno.  I cant seem to go to church and end up being happy with God for that one.  Oh yeah, the little duder would have been 23 on the 10th this month.  Must admit, still kinda numb.  I even laughed when the Rams beat the Bears the other weekend, cursing the boy with a big smile on my face.  Life hasnt been the same since...  On another another note, Sammy is most definately a domestic Goddess (and no, she didnt tell me to write this...).  I have done nothing this weekend except eat awesome oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and also pumpkin crunch cake.  Right now she is making us farfalle and rotini for dinner.  Ohhhh yeah.  Speaking of which, its done!  Mmmmmmmmmm dinner!

      Bob chose Stella.... As Sammy puts it, "do we even care?"  no, not really, but hey, I thought it was kinda funny to see the one girl get shot down.  Man, Im a sick bastard.  I shouldn't laugh cause if it was me, well, lets just say they probably couldn't air all the violence, profanity, and all around chaos I would cause.  Heartbreak sucks, and I don't wish it upon anyone.  I think I was laughing more at the way TV has trivialized emotions.  I mean, this was a very private moment between people that has just been viewed by millions.  Ouch.  That and Bob gave Stella a promise ring... the fucking pansy...  go all out or go home.   None of that 'promise' stuff.  Besides, when you get someone a diamond promise ring, do you get to propose with the same ring?  Kill two birds with one stone, almost literally.  "Hey baby, this is gonna be yours if I end up actually loving you!"  I also think its funny that Bob got to be a man-whore with all these other women and now she gets to watch it.  Nothing says I love you like making out with other people!  I guess I just don't understand reality television.  Perhaps I would like to keep it that way.  There is something wrong with us when we find pleasure in trifling with other's emotions.  Especially complete strangers.  Ever watch Joe Schmo?  Yeah, now THAT was funny...  Speaking of funny and laughing at other people's pain, watch MXC:  Most Extreme Elimination Challenge.  Man, those Japanese are funny people.  Why can't we do stuff like that in the US?  Liability?  Ok, question for you all.  If someone tells you something really exciting and you tell someone else before the original person tells the person you told, is it wrong of you?  Especially if there was no mention that you couldnt tell other people?  I mean, it wasnt a rumor, it wasnt a lie, it was actually a very cool thing... Well, whatever...  Class was fun tonight.  Me, John, and Smelly Todd.  Bunch of kids too.  Todd is still kinda weird.  He tries to imitate the moves I do on him and he tries to do them much harder to me.  Poor kid.  I still hold back on him.  I dont think he is ready yet for a real sparring match.  Only me and John were after class though, working on staff.  It was awesome.  He complimented me for being here for so long and my progression, and I was really proud because he NEVER compliments anyone.  So that was cool.  I guess tonight was better than I thought.  I just really need to work on my over-reacting.  Im too damn sensitive

       urlLink Big cheers for Massachusetts!   Striking down a ban of gay marriage is just the first step towards finally getting a same sex union ok'd.  I mean, really, what is the big deal of the matter?  I personally feel that love holds no gender, and if you find someone of the same sex who you truly love, then good for you.  Does this mean the moral downfall of America?  No, and I think you're nuts if you think so.  What is gay marriage going to do besides give them the opportunity to share benefits and profess their love for each other?  Why should this be different than when I get married?  I mean, even if you don't approve of the lifestyle, cant we just be happy for one another?  "I found someone I really connect with, I found some I care about deeply, I found someone I really love"  but that's not ok, just because they happen to be of the same sex.    But what about the Bible?  Doesn't God say Homosexuality is a sin?  I think this quote sums up my feelings nicely:  "Reason has played a major part in religion ever since two Biblical nudists took dietary advice from a talking snake." Jon Stewart-The Daily Show, November 4  Love God, Love Jesus, just don't trust the Church (I mean this more as the largest political/organized crime machine that causes televangelism and narrows your mind).  The Bible was written by the same people who created indulgences, the Spanish Inquisition, the thought that women were property, and the bubonic plague (although I cant scientifically prove that one, Im sure they had something to do with it!!! hahahaha!)  So until I see the 1900 year old scroll written in Greek, Latin, or Aramaic, then I'm only taking the good lessons out of the Bible and saying the rest was just written for control of the masses.  Anyways, enough religion bashing.    Just think.  How does this really affect your life?  Unless your partner decides to run off with someone of the same sex and get married, then it doesn't matter, does it?  And if they do run off, then you've had problems way before that point.  So why not let love prevail and just accept that being gay isn't such a horrible crime.  If you can come up with a valid argument as to why same sex marriage is wrong without referring to God in any way, then  urlLink PLEASE EMAIL ME  and prove me wrong.  Really.  Prove me wrong.  I dare you.    So in the mean time...  Be good to yourself, and one another.

      Tonight was huge (still Monday in my book).  Best mood I have been in for a while.  Unfortunately I couldnt pass it on to someone who could have used it more than myself.  Oh well.  Time for that later.  Anyways, Lark was a no show, of course...  Not like anyone who just had major surgery would show up to a TKD lesson 3 days later.  Umm... yeah.  So it was just me and Tiff and John didnt have the kids, so we expected a massive huge training session with just us.  Well, didnt happen.  A tad bit disappointed, but whatever.  Got to learn a bit more on pressure points and stuff.  Thats gonna take me a while to learn, but well worth it I think.  I could use all the positive stuff there is.  Body feels like its gonna fall apart.  Especially in the legs.  I think there is a point that you hit where you start having issues with strength vs flexibility.  Bill can back me up on this one.  Throw in some length/tension curves, talk about sarcomere bridge cycling, band length, etc.  Wow do I miss science.  Maybe I can try and justify Chi as a physiological response.  Good lord, I have the training for it.  Bedtime.  Starting to cough again.... If I get sick more than I already am, so help me God...  I dunno... it wont be nice.    Baby Liver All You Can Eat! 5.95  This message brought to you by the Dome on the corner of Wolf and Joliet Rd. I couldnt help just thinking this sign was hysterical.  Maybe Im just sick...  Oh yeah, note to self:  Sam needs to see Monty Python's Life of Brian      "Life is full of shit, when you look at it.  Life's a laugh and Death's a joke it's true               You'll see its all a show, keep em laughin as you go, and you'll find that the last laugh is on you!                       And always look on the bright side of life..."   Sorry best I could do with the lyrics right off top of my head

      I love it when I actually get to see Sammy.  Had a fun weekend.  Lion King, Hot Tub, big breakfast with the family.  All in all, this was the best weekend that I have had in a good long while.  No crazy stories though... hehe...  Cant wait for this weekend when I get to go up to Kalamazoo and meet Sam's friends finally.  For how often I've been up there, I have only met Emily, this girl in her program.  So I cant wait to meet the rest and hang out for once.  That and I need to cook...  Just what, I don't really know.  Maybe Tortilla soup...  I'm good at that one, pending I use cilantro instead of Italian parsley.  Yes, I'm a dumbass, but when you have a constant cold, smelling stuff isn't too easy.  So yeah, anyways, around Christmas-ish John's present to me is the next set of iron body moves, and also pressure point info.  For healing of course.  Re-routing to center Chi and whatnot.  That reminds me.  I wonder how Lark is?  She had surgery Friday to have her sinuses reconstructed.  Fun stuff.  She might be there after class tonight depending on how well she feels.  All I remember from having my tonsils and adenoids out was no stressful movement for a good 3 weeks or so.  Insane.  Stress is probably the worst thing I'm feeling in my life right now, and I know its affecting others close to me (either by my stress or their own).  John was philosophizing on Saturday on how life doesn't get any easier.  I somehow wish he wasn't telling the truth.  I'm still pretty far behind in my schoolwork, although I got a freebie for one of my stats quizzes.  Makes life a little bit better.  Since I should keep working to make sure this stress doesnt get too out of control, then I should go back to my work.  Oh well.  Maybe more tonight depending on TKD.  P.S.  Ive decided that I really only respect bands that have more than just guitar, bass, and drums.  Sitting listening to Chicago, I came to this conclusion.  I mean, seriously.  Chicago, Jethro Tull, Ben Folds, Dave Matthews, etc.  It takes so much more talent to come up with a song when you have horns, string, and percussion than just a guitar.

      Wow... All I can say... Wow...  The Lion King was possibly the coolest thing I have ever seen.  The costumes were PHENOMENAL.  Everything was so incredibly detailed.  I think my favorite was the giraffes.  It were these guys with stilts on their hands and feet, and the neck came up out of their head.  I could imagine how rough it would be to walk in one of those things...  The coolest scene?  The one where Mufasa appears to Simba in the clouds...  It was so awesome, I cant even describe to you how it looked.  It was amazing how not only was there acting, but it was puppeteering.  As the actors would interact with each other, they would make the animals do the same.  Its kinda hard to explain all the technical details, but needless to say, you should see this play.  The story was great.  There were a few different things though, including songs and scenes.  Now I know where Morning Report came from, as it was originally part of the broadway show that they threw into the DVD.  The music was great too.  Bongo/conga/huge ass drum sets on each side in a balcony and in the pit.  Very tribal.  Lots of swahili.  Cast was exceptional.  Go see it.  Especially if you love the movie.  Thank you again Low family!

       urlLink This is just Sad...   Really.  What in the world would make you jump a fence and try to pet a BC Grey wolf?  Of course he is gonna clamp on your arm!  He's not a dog, for God's sake!  Poor Cinnamon Bear.  He had no chance.  I think that the woman should have been shot instead of the wolf.  Thin the herd.  Put chlorine in the gene pool.  How unfair is this?  We have to end the life of a perfectly good grey wolf because some fucking idiot decided she wanted to "play" with him.  Anyone who has ever seen Bear, he was a gorgeous wolf.  Even in his old age, he appeared to be majestic and noble.  In my 4 years of working at the zoo, this is probably the saddest moment I've experienced.  Not even when we had to euthanize Mame was I this outraged.  Maybe its because it was a humans fault this time.  Its just another example of how stupid people do stupid shit and how these stupid people think that we can control nature.  "But Mike, isn't a zoo controlling nature?"  NO!  Zoos are essential in the conservation and preservation of certain species of animals.  It gives the animal a home free of resource competition and gives us a chance to observe and study these animals so we can take our research out into the wild.  We learn more about animal genetics, reproduction, husbandry, physiological information, and much more information on a daily basis.  On the basic level, it gives people the chance to see animals they never would normally see, and learn more about them so they too can help in the struggle for conservation.  I don't care if you don't like to see animals "behind bars" because if you can't see the zoological society for what it really is, then you are just as bad as this lady is.  Anyways, I hope they file charges against this moron and that she feels horrible for what she did.  If I hear that she sues the zoo, I think that its time to move to another country.  A senseless waste of life, really.  PS  Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull made a crude comment about the American Flag, and I couldn't agree more!  Do your own research on that one, kids.  I've got tests to take.

      God Dammit, I miss the Lodge.  You never know how much you miss stuff until its gone.  I mean, the stuff like community showers you can do without (although beer, lawnchairs, and swimsuits always made it alot more fun!), but I went to bed at 11 last night...  Thats just kinda sad.  One thing that I really miss is even at 3 in the morning, there is always someone up, hanging out, drunk, doing something stupid, or (yes, some of us actually did this) studying.  I tried to get some homework done last night, and it didnt happen.  Lack of being able to walk away for a half an hour and play videogames with Steve.  Just wait till I come down in December... I will beat you yet in SNK vs Capcom...  Also I wonder if the pledges have attempted a takeover yet.  I still remember TJ climbing down the tree using Whit's safety ladder that was way too short.  Those were the days...

      Tonight was pretty damn intense.  Class itself was a bit difficult.  Especially since I can only breathe about 40% through my nose.  Makes deep breathing during kicking a little rough.  Master Park made me kick with a 5 year old again...  I know I am supposed to teach him, but its a bit rough.  I mean, the little guy doesn't even have control over his body!  So he cant really do the kicks and he definitely cant hold the target for me.  So I just tell him to stand back and I do my thing and try to not kill him.  At least if the kid is a bit older/taller, they can hang onto the target so I can at least kick it.  Oh well.  I guess I'm just not good at teaching the little ones.  Speaking of little ones, poor Stephan is moving again.  This kid showed up at the beginning of summer from I think Minnesota or something, and now he is moving to Florida on the 25th.  Doesn't even phase him.  I don't know how a kid can do that.  But I guess if that's how you are raised, then you can deal with it.  I mean, he's 12, he cant even make friends cause he just keeps moving.  I don't think I could do that to my kids when I have 'em.  Anyways, I digress...  After class, we did another 5 movements on staff.  Getting there... Only another 50 to go...  I just cant wait until we do that and then start on the Tai Chi sword form.  That and after everything else, we learned about chi flow and such as John realigned Lark with pressure points.  Very cool.  Might get into that later, but I think I will stick to the iron body for now.  Another month, and I get to start on my arms and hands.  Takes up more time and I might need to buy some equipment so I can practice at home, but its worth it cause I already am starting to feel improvement in my legs.  Keep it up and who knows what that will do for me.  So yeah, maybe I should do some homework so I can take my stats test.  Man, I hate stats...

      Within the framework of the Buddhist Path, reflecting on suffering has tremendous importance because by realizing the nature of suffering, you will develop greater resolve to put an end to the causes of suffering and the unwholesome deeds which lead to suffering. And it will increase your enthusiasm for engaging in the wholesome actions and deeds which lead to happiness and joy. - The Dali Lama Profound, yet simple.  Chew on that one for a while brain!  So yeah.  It's Veteran's Day.  Happy being a Veteran for all those who have fought for our country.  What exactly is fighting for our country?  Is it like someone is trying to take us over?  I mean, with the Revolutionary War, we fought for our country.  For the Civil War, we fought for our country.  But everything else, it just sounds like we wanted to kick someone's ass for the fun of it.  World Wars?  We fought for the freedom of millions?  Sure that's a good thing, but did we really  have  to get involved?  Nah.  We could have stayed out if we wanted to.  But what about the Lama?  Are we creating suffering or trying to end it?  We get invovled in these wars and lose countless amounts of lives, and do nothing but create suffering for ourselves and the ones we conquer.  What about the ends?  What about the means?  What about terrorists who hate us?  Are we somehow to blame for their existence?  So how in the hell do we correct this without having to just kill thousands of those who stand in our way?  Like the Lama said:  reflect on the cause of suffering.  Go look in the mirror now.  I think the reflection might surprise you.  Happy Vet's day, and for all those who are soon to be Vets, keep your heads down, stay safe, and please, come back in one piece.  I  know this is all one incomplete thought after the next, but my mind is swirling faster then I can write.  Time for statistics.

      So yeah, time for a redo.  For those of you who care, I am a 22 year old suburbanite of Chicago.  I have a bachelors degree from the University of Illinois in Molecular and Integrative Physiology and am currently on the quest to become a RN.  Still living at home doing odd jobs and trying to raise money for *ahem* more important things.  I'm 5'8" and weigh about 230 lbs (although I think its more muscle than anything...).  Blonde hair, green eyes, etc.  Two things keep me going:  my martial arts and her.  By her I mean the one person who can somehow draw reason from utter chaos.  Sometimes I trust her more than I trust myself.  She keeps my feet on the ground and I wish I could do the same for her.  Maybe I do, maybe I don't.  Needless to say, she does keep me going.  Anyways, to continue, I do love martial arts.  The human body is a wonderful thing, and I think the martial arts can display the beauty and power of the human body more than any sport I can think of.  Power, speed, agility, fluidity, coordination, reaction, and basically anything else you can think of are found in the martial arts.  Especially when you look at the broad range of styles.  I personally have done three:  Tae Kwon Do, Wushu, and Capoeira.  Tae Kwon Do is where I started it all, and where I came to love the things it stands for.  If you look at the five principles, you notice that not one of them is destructive.  Nowhere does it say to become stronger than your opponents or attack the innocent.  Its all about becoming a better person.  I can go much more into philosophy, but I will save that for another time.  Wushu is aesthetically beautiful.  To watch all the different forms is amazing, seeing the person move in ways that can only be described as watching a river flow.  Capoeira is a spectacle of human emotion.  Never in any group have I felt such ties to those around me.  As the mestres' said, "somos a familia" or "we are all family."  Its a dance, a game, a martial art, and a way of life.  So I'm outta here for now.  If something cool comes up at TKD tonight, then I will write later.

      Note to self, stop falling down stairs.  Ok, this time, I fell going up stairs, but I dont know why it happened.  Maybe I rush things too much.  Who knows.  Im spastic.  Anyways, still no new years plans for me or Sam.  I just dont know if I have the desire to do anything or not, even though I do kinda want to go out.  Maybe.  I dunno.  I've just been very down lately.  Could be the season, could be alot of things in my life that I am maybe possibly starting to second guess.  About places, things, peoples, and futures.  Im not asking for a storybook life, but right now things are just a bit too fucked up for words.  Well, I need to go do something with my day, otherwise, I will just end up brooding more and things will only get worse.  Brooding is no good.  Learned that in abnormal psych class.  The more you think about things, the worse it gets.  I think Im starting to actually believe that.   Happy New Years Everyone!  I just hope 2004 is a bit better than 2003 was...

      HEY!!!  LOOK RIGHT!!!  I've got pictures up!  So yeah, sorry to all my faithful readers... (Bill) as it has been a while since my last post.  Christmas was nuts, as Sam and I tried the dual family Christmas thingy.  Yikes.  I thought it was ok, but she didnt.  It was a bit rough for both of us, as this is probably the last time I would see my cousin Leigh for a while as she is now taking the job from the Big M.  That and Karli was in (another cousin) and whatnot.  It was hard to leave my family too.  Anyways, I have a new toy, as is evident from the new link on the side.  Canon SD100 digital elph.  3.2 MP with a 3x optical zoom.  Sweet tits.  Well, back to life as usual... Kinda.  Busy week this week being New Years and all.  That and I have Erin's wedding this weekend.  Fun times.  Speaking of New Years, anyone have any plans?  I need some...   Next week:  The Adventures of Mike at the Old Folks Home!

      Jim's car broke down last night.  In the parking lot of Best Buy at North Riverside mall.  Drive belt.  Tried to fix it ourselves, but we are retards and we couldnt.  So Jim must go for a few days without an auto.  Sucks to be him.  Sucks more that we gave him our car to use for the time being.  Crapola!  Cant wait for Sunday as John wants a 2 hour yoga/meditation/breathing session.  Should be sweet.  Ring in the new year with yoga... Should be cool.  Must make squid for dinner tonight.  Man, I love Calamari.  Good shit.  Really.  Dont know what you're missing unless you try some of the stuff I make.  Simple.  Just put the squid in a bit of seasoned flour and chuck it in some olive oil.  Sure beats most of the stuff you find in a restaurant.  Well, now off to clean and then relax before the Christmas Madness.  Been listening nonstop to Breaking Benjamin as well.  Not quite Christmas music, but fits the season in my mind.  Besides, he would have agreed with me...

      Sweetest Grab Bag gift ever!  I cant say, as some family members may be reading this, so you will know it after Thursday.  Anyways, messed up my left pinky at Tae Kwon Do.  Crazy night.  Lark is getting arrested tomorrow.  Her law firm is being held in contempt (I think she said it was No Comply for all you law buffs out there...) so since she is doing nothing special for Christmas (as she is single and her family lives in Arkansas) she was volunteered to do the time.  And this is scary because if the judge feels like it, then she REALLY goes to jail.  26th and California.  County.  Craziness.  So I hope she doesnt go to jail, but she said I could be her one phone call!  Anyways, gonna hang out with Sammy.  Chill.  Oh yeah.

      Ok, anger at the brother has subsided.  It happens.  Anyways, the weekend was full of beer, boobs, and RDT (that's raspberry danish twist for those of you who didn't live in the Lodge).  Friday night I took Sammy to El Famous for the first time ever.  I don't think she was too impressed.  I still love it a hell of a lot more than La Bambas.  At El Famous, you at least get the hot pickled carrots and peppers...  Sweet.  In the evening and into early morning, there was a party at Pop's which was a pretty sweet time.  Sam was wasted and for some reason, I was just annoyed.  Maybe it was because of all of the drama from that morning and the fact I had to work.  I still had a good time, especially watching Meathouse try and pick up Laura.  Then at the end of the night, he calls her Julie.  She was like "huh?"  and he was like "that's your name, right?  Julie?"  and then he proceeds to start banging his head against the wall.  Poor Matt...  Saturday, worked at the packed zoo, then had two parties to go to.  First went to Erin G's birthday celebration at Irish Eyes in LP (literally a block north of DePaul) and then we went to the CBJ for Bill and Big Dead's X-mas extravaganza.  It was my turn to get wasted, and I had no money at the bar.  Hell, Sammy had to pay my cover.  Boo to me...  Anyways, Irish Eyes was pretty cool, but I kinda feel weird when I go out with that group of people, because I find I don't really have much to converse with.  They all have jobs and real lives, and I still live at home and work at the zoo.  So that was a tad bit awkward.  But then a little walk to Bill's who conveniently lived about a mile away and I was surrounded by Lodgers of all ages.  I think I did a little bit better at this point, as with the Lodgers I have more shared experiences, and the funny stories of stupid shit we did are endless.  So I got drunk on about 6 beers and a very large egg nog.  Mmmmmm egg nog.  When the brandy burns your lips when you take a sip, you know its good.  And you were too runk to pour your own drink sensibly.  Hey, it happens.  It was cool because Sammy was a great sport and didn't leave until about 3:30.  Everyone else was basically gone, but then the RDT showed up and so did Scotty and Jeff May.  That was fun.  So all in all, it was a very good night and I just hope Sammy had a fun time this weekend too.    My hip still hurts.  Yesterday morning, I fell down the stairs while on the phone with Sammy.  Tony thought we were being attacked.  Foot just slipped out from under me.  Gotta admit, it was pretty funny, but very painful.  Large rug burn on my ass.  Damn.  Christmas is less than a week away.  And I just keep getting more and more depressed.  Wow, this sucks.  Maybe things will be better by New Years...

      First off, Return of the King is the best movie ever.  Period.  All the action and anticipation of the first two movies carries over to this one, and the ending is just astounding.  If the ending of the Matrix left you this empty hole in your soul where you need some sort of closure, then go see this movie.  Fairly true to the book, although Jim says that they could have easily thrown in another hour of extra stuff.  We shall see.  But go, watch, and be happy.  Second, I think I have grown to not stand my little brother.  Maybe this is just because of who I am.  For those of you who dont know me, Im very straight edge.  I've just recently learned that he smokes, drinks, and has been smoking weed since he was a Sophomore in High School.  Just totally the opposite of me.  Not that I am against any of this, but he isnt the person that I grew up with.  Not in the slightest.  So today, I woke him up at 11 because I needed to move my green Ikea bookshelf out of my old room and into my new one.  I have no pity on him because all he does is stay up all night playing either Xbox or online poker.  Get a fucking life.  The room is a pit.  Dirty clothes everywhere, baskets of clothes all over the place, his guitars and bass are leaned up against my shelf, so I try and do a bit of moving so I can actually do my work.  I put the guitars on the bed and not thinking, I put a box on his fairly brand new guitar.  Needless to say, it breaks 3 of his strings and he claims his bridge and pickup are gone too (complete bullshit as I pick up the thing and look at it), so later as Im halfway done with my stuff he comes upstairs all pissed that he had to be woken up, sees the guitar, and flips out.  Yelling, screaming, cursing ensues, and I am pissed...  I said I was sorry, but if he had actually cleaned up or taken care of his own stuff, this could have been avoided, right?  That, and Im pissed at his lack of responsibility.  Where the fuck does he get the idea that I have to buy him a new guitar when he owes me almost $150 in cell phone charges.  If we go back to the days of the mafia, I should have every right to not only take his stuff and pawn it, but I should be able to destroy it at will.  So fuck off Tony, it was an accident, and if you dont take care of your shit, then I dont care what happens to it.  Angry.  Rage.  And now the parents are on my ass.  I fucking hate my life and I hate being here.  Fuck my dreams of going into medicine.  Now, all I want to do is just escape...

      I'm feeling mean today / Not lost, not blown away / Just irritated and quite hated / till control breaks down  Why's everything so tame / I like my life insane / I'm fabricating and defeating you / I'm gunna kick around  -Korn, Right Now  Kinda makes a little sense as to how Im feeling right now.  Today is an angry day.  Ive experienced many things that irritated me beyond control today.  First off, lets take the US postal service in La Grange.  I stand in line for a good 5 minutes so I can mail two of my bills.  I just need stamps.  The lady working at the desk, Jean, proceeds to look at me like I just shot her fucking dog, and says "you only need stamps?"  YES!  Im too damn cheap to buy a whole book of them when I only need two.  Who cares?  Apparently Jean does.  I would just like to apologize for taking 30 seconds of your otherwise meaningless life away from you.  Happy Holidays, Jean.  Next, driving to COD, on 88 the left lane closes due to some construction.  So, being aware of this fact, when I see the sign, I move into the right lane as soon as I possibly can, because, duh, the lane is going to end in 1000 feet.  However, not everyone has my sense of logic.  Many cars zoom past me on the left, driving all the way to the point where the lane starts moving over.  Then they proceed to cut off anyone who happens to be next to them at the time the lane ends.  This causes the people in my lane to slam on their brakes to avoid an accident, stopping the flow of traffic in my lane.  Am I being selfish?  Does this not make sense?  Are you in that big of a fucking rush that you cant get over when you see the sign, and then we can all drive happily past the construction?  I say from now on, if you are within 50 feet of the lane ending, you're fucked.  You had your opportunity to get over.  Sit and wait until there is a break in traffic or some kindhearted person who isnt pissed off at your driving is nice enough to maybe let you past.  Im not 100% sure, but legally, we people who know how to drive and have already moved over a lane have the right of way, and if you merge into us, you're at fault.  I might do that some time.  Might get a nice, new car out of the deal.    In the library, there was a girl who was loud as hell on her cell phone.  I almost went over to her, slapped her, and throw her cell phone out the window.  Im glad I wasnt feeling  that  angry today.  She is probably glad for that too.  It's a library.  People study.  Its supposed to be relatively quiet.  Slut...  On my way home, I noticed yet another thing.  People dont use their turn signals... Especially on the expressway.  When you are going 75+ mph, is it good to just move in front of someone without giving them at least 2 blinks notice?  I havent quite finished the course on mind control and telepathy, so if you could please let your intentions be known to me?  I'd hate to die in a car wreck because some asshole couldnt move his wrist three inches.  And if I do, he damn well better have a broken wrist from whacking it too much.  Common courtesy everyone.  THINK.  PLEASE.  For my sanity as well as others.   Now off to TKD to blow some steam and hopefully not be so angry.  Also, Im kinda angry at myself because I accidentally kicked a kid in the stomach on Monday.  Full story when I get home possibly.    DO THIS:  Go to Google and type in "miserable failure" then press "Im feeling lucky..."  Its the funniest thing I have ever seen.  It made my night!  Peace.

      Saturday was nuts.  Very nuts.  Sunday was boring.  Yesterday I had a drug test for the CNA program.  I studied for an hour or two and then I passed.  Only thing that sucked was it was right in the middle of the day, so I couldnt really get anything done.  Oh well.    Im getting very frustrated with my body lately. I feel slow, sluggish, and my back still hurts.  I dont know if this is a weather thing, but I dont like it.  I was doing great for a while, and then boom.  Brick wall.  No motivation or anything.  I also missed a week while I was doing my finals which could have hurt my progress.  But then again, it was probably better for my back.  I dunno.  It was weird though.  In our little meditation session/tai chi sword after class, John seemed to read my mind.  He was talking about how some days, you feel your chi and can move it no problem, other days its hard to move it, and yet some days you cant find it at all.  Yesterday was one of those days where I couldnt find it at all.  He also talked about how even if you dont feel it, it is there, and it is still moving, so even the slightest bit of practice can help out.  Makes alot of sense in my mind.  So yeah, for today, I need to clean my pit that I call a room and then possibly TKD and then possibly waiting in line at 10 to go see Return of the King at midnight tonight.  Sweet titties... I cant wait for it...

      Hanging out.  Doing stuff.  Man, tonight is gonna be a blast.  My parent's college friends are coming over which means drunken disorderly conduct at my place tonight.  Always a good time.  Too bad I have to work until 9ish.   Hopefully I can book outta that a bit early (although not too early!)  Doing the hayride.  How that works out, I have no clue.  Oh well, gotta help my ma clean up before the festivities tonight. WOO!  Rock!

      So yeah, drunken revelation #1 of the weekend... Rocking out to Jet in Steve's bed with him and Mo.  Good times... Good times...   Also I have decided that NASCAR is in fact a sport.  After much deliberation and controversy, I have decided that we can call them athletes.  Sitting in a car going really really fast does take alot out of you, and you kinda have to be smart and you definately need lightning fast reflexes.  But I mean, you need intelligence and endurance in chess, but do we call them athletes?  Crap.  Im torn again.  Oh well.  Perhaps this will never be resolved.  Anyone have any opinions on this?  On a positive note, I can retake the test I only got a 75% on today.  Was a little bit pressed for time on getting back here so I could watch baby cause Jim was getting out of work late, so I rushed big time.  Maybe will take that tomorrow after I pay my millions of dollars in tuition to COD.  Figured out John was right about my neck.  When doing head raises, I felt something grind and then proceeded to feel my lower back tighten up.  Crazy how that happens.  Guess I just need to go easy until its better.  But Im eating way too much and Im fat.  Now I sound like a whiny little bitch.  Well, thats cause I am one.  Thats right.  I admit it.  Im a whiny little bitch and I've lost my testicles.  They fell off.  At least Im honest.  Chickenfucker.   Oh yeah, and you can't be a non-conformist unless you drink coffee...

      *Now Begin Longest Blog Ever* (for me anyways)  Where to begin?  A real quick side note is how Pop and I took advantage of the Cock Block.  We proceed to interfere with DQ's attempt to get some with some Alpha Gam by walking into his room and making small talk.  After a good five minutes about arguing about the Sox vs Cubs, Dan finally breaks down and hands over his bottles of Jameson and Jim Beam, making us very happy as we got to drink more.  Lesson of the story?  If you need alcohol, go Cock Block someone...Try it, and if it doesn't work, I will buy you a beer.  Trust me, any guy will part with his alcohol if it means he will have relations with a female.    So why not go back to Friday, as that is where I left off.  So yeah, after being surprisingly not hungover on Friday, I played videogames all day with the boys, as planned.  I also did some cleaning while rocking out to The Darkness.  Damn.  It was some heavy rocking out too.  Definitely a new CD I want for Christmas... Initiation was fun, although Pop kinda took off after a fight with Nino, but I think they were both being tools and overreacting.  Just my call.  That night, Nino comes to me and asks me to be the keynote speaker for the banquet on Saturday, and that was nice, considering I had half a night to think about what I would say, and that half a night was occupied by initiation itself.  Oh joy.  So the banquet rolls around and I make my oh so wonderful speech about living in the lodge and what it has meant to me and stuff like that.    So anyways, afterwards, we hang out, get to know the new kids, aaaaaaaand basically start drinking.  Me, Steve, Maureen, Justin-credible (Tarnhoff), and Jacquie start playing Scrabble.  Real quick, if you don't know who Jacquie is, she is Seyller's incredibly hot girlfriend who is 18 and went to LT, and I just thought I should mention that she is incredibly hot because she is going out with Seyller, who as we all know, is not hot, but definitely the funniest man I know.  But I digress... Jacquie and I were on a team (as she had never ever played Scrabble before), and everyone else was flying solo.  I was sucking as usual, until I saw an opportunity for a 40 point word using the triple word score and the Q-u that I had stored up, only to have it taken by Justin, and Team Muff gets destroyed the rest of the game.  But the game never quite made it to the end, because as we were playing, we all did 4 shots of Goldschlager (which PERFECTLY killed the bottle) and 2 shots of Jager.  So needless to say, by the time the bag was out of letters, we were out of braincells.  Words were made up and disputions were ended in a wrestling match.  So we were drunk after that, and all I remember was going up to Gibbles' room to watch some porn.  Somehow,  Bosche came in with a cock ring that ended up in my possession.  I think its unused, I pray its unused, and since Bosche wouldn't know what to do with it (hahahahahahahahahahhahahaha!), I'm pretty darn sure it was unused.  So now I have a nice cock ring to never use because I dunno, it would just be too funny to me.  Drunken e-mailed Sammy, then off to White Horse for the I-party.  After drunkenly scarfing down a chicken sandwich and some cheese fries that I bought the table, I start drinking pitchers of beer.  While occasionally pouring a cup for someone else, I did go through 3 pitchers, which meant I probably drank a lot.  After the keg went dry, I bought a pitcher for myself and called it a night in the drinking department.  So then I was hanging out with the new kids, asking them more annoying questions you hear from some guy who you will only see a few times a year, and around 1:15ish, I hear those words that every young adult dreads hearing... "Oh fuck... Police!"  Instinctively, I grab for Andrew's beer (a new-I) and start sipping on it, wondering if it will come back up on me, as I was fading fast.  As our little tiny get-together gets busted by Champaign's finest, I was asked for ID by at least 4 of the 10 cops who were there.  I was sitting at the table with May who was reveling in the fact that this was his first official night as our #1.  "Shit... This is just what I need..." He repeated over and over.  I felt bad for little Kolman too who got pulled aside with an actual drink.  Baddison lived up to his name, as he didn't say a word to the cops.  Two girls who I don't know got busted (friends of Kolman's) but then Kristen got busted too.  This is one of Tim's friends, and basically the nerves got to her, and when the cops asked for her license, she puked all over them.  Nice touch.  The cops thought she was wasted beyond belief, but she was actually only a bit drunk, but just so freaked out, she spewed.  A good three times too.  I would have gone to all their rescue, but I played it cool, avoiding an adult responsibility ticket.  I was drunk, but my no means stupid.  So back to the Lodge to end the evening.  I come home and think about sleep until I hear lots of profanity coming into the Lodge.  Its Andrew, so I go and try and console the dude.  Only to find him laughing the whole thing off, but just pissed that it happened.  He claims he wasn't worried, but really, I don't care how cool your parents are, I would be a bit nervous telling them what happened.  Kristen comes in with Tim, Tim talks about his near obstruction of justice charges, and Kristen is bawling her eyes out screaming how her life is over.  I felt bad for her, but not that bad.  I guess I'm just a cold hearted asshole.  So consensus decided its time for a stack.  Consensus was me, Andrew, BTC, and Brian's friend who I don't really know.  So we walk to the Home of the Stack (and Horseshoe for those who know of the Stack's bastard half brother) and get some of the most disappointing stacks I have ever had.  Small and the hash browns were burnt.  I could have cried and sworn off them for good right then and there...  but nah.  I decided to pay for Andrew's stack, because he has to put up with a $280 ticket and because I'm such a nice guy...  So walked home and crashed.  I made the error of not drinking any more water before bed, and Sunday morning I suffered.  Sunday was spent trying to feel human again and watching the Bears suck on more balls than a... well, I wont say it because I'm a gentleman, and referencing a 14 year old Saigon hooker is just tasteless.  My stomach was angry at me.  Very very angry.  But I did feel better by about 4:00 after a nice long hot shower.  After some video game playing and hanging out, I wanted to go see the Last Samurai, but was vetoed to sit down and watch Pirates of the Caribbean and drink Pearl Harbors to commemorate the naval activities of the past (yes, yesterday was in fact Pearl Harbor Day).  By the way, Pearl Harbors are one hell of a martini.  Its vodka, midori (melon liquor), and pineapple juice.  Yummy.  I was ok with such events.  That ends up with today.  Woke up, hung out till lunch, paid my debt to the University (a whopping $5.27), and came home.  Nice drive.  Lots of cops, but since I had already ran into a whole lot of them earlier this weekend, fate smiled upon me and TWICE I saw the guy ahead of me get pulled over.   Made it home in exactly two hours and used a whole stinking quarter of a tank of gas.  Went to Tae Kwon Do for the first time in over a week, and it felt great, although I'm feeling very apprehensive about my back.  Had bone damage, had muscle damage, but never nerve damage.  Maybe I should go easy on this one.  Master Park was a bit upset about the hundred bucks I gave him, as its a bit smaller than my usual payment.  The fact that I have to pay about $700 in tuition in a week and its Christmas means the cash reserves are running a bit low.  Thankfully, the zoo work these next couple of weekends will keep me floating, but I finally think its time for a new job.  Yes, you have all told me, and yes, I will finally do it now because I'm temporarily done with class and can handle working again.  As I have proven this quarter, working nearly full time and taking 15 credit hours makes life very tough, especially when you have many many more responsibilities.  So anyways, Master Park gave me my Christmas present from Korea, and this year it wasn't a calendar... IT WAS A TIE!!!  I mean, I got the cooler gift cause I'm a black belt and I help out a lot now, so you get better presents the more stuff you do.  But the tie is actually kinda cool and I will upload a picture of it if I figure out how to do that.  Although I never could wear it ever with anything I own.  But its the thought that counts, right?  So that brings me here, and I think I'm spent...

      Yeah.  Champaign rules... So last night, Nino, DQ, Kyle (the alpha visitor from our central office) and myself went out to dinner at El Torero (I still prefer Dos, but hey, whatever) and polished off two pitchers of margaritas between Nino, me, and Kyle.  Then we proceed to go back to the Lodge and drink more after exchanging secret santa gifts and sit through the pledge's fireside chat.  So that finishes around 11, so we (now me, Gibbles, Pop, Neal, Gabe, and Kyle) go out to Murphy's (which had a line, mind you...) and drink some more.  Does anyone see where this is going?  So after Murphy's, Gibbles decides we should go to the Silver Bullet.  So we go see some boobies.  I still don't really like strip clubs too much...  Its just such a tease and there are rules, and its awkward, and I feel like I should be a fat bald 40 year old man while sitting and watching these girls do their thing.  It was funny cause Gabe and Gibbles are pretty much regulars and know a few of the girls there.  We decided to please Bill with what is called the "conference call."  All that is, is you tell a stripper to moan into the phone for the guy on the other end and scream his name a few times.  I dunno.  I think Bill enjoyed it, as I think we woke him up for it.  One of the strippers was all over one of the guys, and she was totally in love.  I mean, she told him her real name and she said we should wait for her after she gets out so we can go to a bar.  And so we're like, "ok, sounds great!" then proceed to bolt to our cars and drive off without her.  Yes we are nice like that.  So then we go to Brothers, meet up with the other Lodgers and drink more.  Went home, fell asleep on the couch.  Had fun.  It was a good night, and there is still more stuff to be done this weekend!

      Nervous as hell.  Tomorrow:  Bed Baths and Beyond...  Resident care is some fun stuff.  Just pray I dont have to change too many diapers.  Now here is where the fun begins, so maybe I might actually have something worthwhile to say.  Otherwise, Im still bored with my life.  The job hunt is rough, as there are either no jobs in the places I want to work, or there are openings in places I wouldnt be caught dead in... (food stuff)  Hopefully I will have my dream job at Borders soon.  Home Depot wouldnt be too bad, and Blockbuster?  If Tim and Nick can do it, so can I...  I just wish I were in a different state, physically and mentally.

      Ok, so I lied, its been over a week since my last post.  But why the delay in the wonderful world of Mike?  Well, its just because I'm lazy.  Pure and simple.  Actually I have been quite busy and haven't really had the time to do such blogging.  So begin backblog of what I've been up to...  Last week on Thursday, I went up and visited Sam in the frozen tundra of Kalamazoo.  We went Ice Skating on Friday and Contra Dancing (look it up, its fucking nuts!) on Saturday with the girls from Sam's audiology program (who are all pretty damn cool from what I could make of em).  After the insane time with the simple folk (John Deer and Sally Plain-and-Tall, seriously the Amish seemed a bit more normal...) a few of us proceed to go to Monaco Bay (a kick ass piano bar that Sam has been kicked out of once before...) and get shit faced.  Thank you God for cabs.  We even met a really cool cabbie named Tom who I feel should become our new official chauffeur.  Its always a fun ride when you discuss the pronunciation of Ypsilanti and try to distinguish which is the best Deja Vu in the state...  Sweet...  Anyways, drove back early early Sunday to say goodbye to my dear sweet brother as he departs back to ISU.  Fucker... But he will be back as Friel will be playing another show this Friday (when and where, I have no clue, but whatever.)  So nothing fun happened Monday except for re-injuring the bone spur on my right fifth metatarsal from where I probably broke it once before, but never healed properly.  It happens.    Today was another story.  First day of clinical and I am already so depressed I wanna shoot myself.  Really.  Our unit?  The people out of the hospital (acute care)?  Nope.  The private residents?  Nope?  The Alzhiemers?  Nope.  Well, not really.  Yes, they have what Reagan have, but in the final forms.  Advanced Alzhiemers...  Few talk, they scream, talk gibberish, don't respond, defecate on themselves, many are combative (that means they like to hit you), and its the worst possible thing ever compared to atypical Parkinson's (that my Grandma has).  Would you rather have a clear functioning mind and be trapped in your body as it goes to shit or lose your mind and not even know that you are losing your body along with it?  Seriously.  If I ever get this way, Im going to have a talk with two gentlemen: Smith and Wesson.  Seeing how these people live, I couldn't or wouldn't want to live like that.  Im sure these poor people don't want to, either.  So where do I come in?  Im here to help make sure that the final moments of their lives are as calm and pleasant as possible so they can die with their dignity.  Although Im sure they don't remember any of what I am doing for them...  But if I can just get one glimpse of the real person trapped inside their mind, then I think this will all be worth it.

      WELCOME BACK! Now that the Holidays are over and Sam has returned up to the frozen north of Kalamazoo, its time for me to continue my online rantings because I no longer have a life and I have quite a bit of free time on my hands now.  So what am I up to now?  Well, today was my first day of my Nursing Assistant classes at the old folks home.  Today I did a lot of paperwork and watched a few videos on blood-born pathogens and the new (kinda) HIPAA rules etc.  What does this mean?  No names or places will be included in my blog, as the government, school, and institution can fuck me big time if I say anything.  Privacy is all important in this age of the "Freedom Act" am I right?  HIPAA?  More like HIPAA-critical!  Zing!  Besides, I like old people.  Hopefully I can become one of them some day, and I wouldn't want everyone else knowing that I pooped my pants on a regular basis.  But the first day was fun.  There is only one other male in my class with 10 girls/women/people with vaginas.  Clinicals start next Tuesday and we get to feed the old folks.  Sounds like a blast!  No really, Im kinda excited.  I just have to get over the fact that I will be shoving food in someone else's face.  Maybe I should practice on Tony...  muwahahahahahahahaaaaaa!  (evil laugh)  So what have I been up to lately?  This weekend was Erin and Tom's wedding which was a blast.  Fun times were had by all (except Joanna's date, but he's getting dumped this week anyways.)  But I wish it could have gone on longer and I could have gotten drunker.  Especially with the entire Lyons Township administrative staff and many teachers whom I have previously had, watching me get blitzed and look like a fool on the dance floor.  Oh well. Good times.  Pictures are up.  Still trying to get the hang of the camera.  For some reason, the Ai focus sucks and focuses on the wrong things.  Gonna have to figure that out better.  Oh well.    TKD tonight, may test, but need to give Master Park a check. Then Bed, cause I have class in the AM.    Rock.  (as stolen from Bill 'cause Im unoriginal)

      Yay Leap year...  Another day of February for no apparent reason except someone screwed up our calendar... Oops.  So yeah, its good to be back at the Zoo.  First off, I am outdoors again and even though it is still a bit chilly, I love it.  Makes me happy.  Also makes me happy cause I totally love my bosses.  Food service is short handed so instead of hiring some dumb teen at 5.50 and hour, they will pay me what I make to do it for them.  In other words tomorrow I will be cleaning up as an extra hand for the food service.  Oh well.  I get to leave to go get my uncle from the airport as early as I need to and they cant to jack about what I can and cant do because they aren't my department.  We are helping them after all, so they are at our mercy.  Is life sweet or what?    I just really have one gripe lately besides being slightly bored with life right now.  Even Sam says I am boring.  How sad is that when the one you love tells you that you live a lame existence?  Although I did go out last night with the boys, which rocked because I just haven't went out for a while.  Unfortunately couldn't get shitty cause I had to work at 9 this morning.  Have a party tonight too, yet cant get shitty cause I have to work.  So yeah, I guess that still makes me lame.  Although Pop was very impressed because he says it was funny how he just called me and I was there no questions asked.  Hey, like I said, I live a boring life.  Wow... Digression...  Ok, so my gripe.  Anyone hear how they are giving away a $6000 HDTV to all of those celebs that attend the Oscars tomorrow?  How messed up is that?  A $46,000 gift basket for attending a 5 hour event on a night when you would probably be sitting on your butt doing nothing at all.  They already make millions a year for pretending to be someone else.  I just don't get it.  Cant you take that money and do something else with it?  SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE?  Lets see... How many people are going to be receiving this basket.  Lets say 100 (which there will most likely be a lot more).  Do you know what a charity could do with FOUR AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS?  Shit, we could rebuild Iraq... Four and a half million dollars would build hundreds of homes for the homeless.  It could provide for the needy and starving of this country and possibly pull a third world country out of IMF debt.  Heck, it could be a start to clearing our own national debt (thanks Dubya).  It could single handedly save an endangered species!  Ok, I don't really know these things because I don't know a darn thing about how NPO's work or their costs or anything like that, but that's not my point.  The point is, this is an absolute waste of money going to people who already make too much.  I think what I'm trying to say is that this society has its heads up their asses, backwards.  I really don't get why we pay athletes, musicians, and actors millions of dollars to do what they do.  We pay them to entertain us.  We don't pay those who educate our children:  Teachers get shit on, and we wonder why our children are so stupid.  Pay a teacher what they deserve, and watch how they start putting effort in teaching.  We don't pay those who save our lives:  We complain about rising health care cost, but screw doctors with insurance and litigation, making them as blue collar as the next guy.  We don't pay those who protect us:  We pay too much to start fights with other countries, yet police and fire personnel suffer.  Once again like the teachers, pay them what they are worth, and you will see quality results.  We don't pay those who make our lives better:  as a CNA, I do what other people will not so that a person can die with their dignity as I strive to make their last moments in this life as peaceful and pleasant as possible, yet I would be financially better off working in a McDonald's.  We do not pay those who would benefit most.  And by this, I mean scientists making medical breakthroughs, those who spend their lives dedicated to finding cures to the epidemics of our time.  Throw that extra four million their way and see what results.  We do not pay for things that we need, yet we pay for entertainment.  I feel like this is how the Roman Empire was, with the gladiators and all.  We only care about our own pleasure and not what is important.  We want entertainment and others will suffer because of this decision.  I think I am becoming too wise in my old age... hehehe.  I think I agree more and more with my little brother every day.  Corruption, lies, greed, and all this negativity fills our society.  I'm growing tired of all this media running our lives, telling us what is right and what is wrong.  I talked with master Muhammed on Thursday night and he was actually making sense to me.  He was born in Iran and came over here many many years ago, but he had something to say on the culture differences.  He was telling me about how the whole Palestinian suicide bomber works.  He told me that in their culture, family is the most important thing, and if someone messes with your family, you must take their lives, or your own.  Some when they feel they have nothing left, they choose both, hence the beginning of all that suicide bombing nonsense.  But it is just their culture.  That is how they live.  Who are we to judge their culture?  I think if we start to understand these cultures, then we realize that you must step back and avoid conflicts that would cause this type of reaction.  I dunno.  I think I'm done ranting.  I've moved on from being bored with life to flat out hating it right now.   Oh yeah, and I say screw the celebrities and give the gifts to the seat fillers...  At least they would appreciate it.

      Tonight, poor Wallace got left out in the garage for a good two hours.  Apparently, my mother went out to take out the garbage, and the cat snuck out with her.  So when my dad gets home from work, he hears this wailing and scratching.  Wally has been sitting and scratching at the door, begging for someone to let him back in the house.  Poor little dude was freezing and pissed off at my mom (even though it was his own fault).  Was funny although Im sure the cat didn't share my feelings on the matter.  Anyways, HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!!!  A few days late, but eh, whatever.  Not like I was here to write it.  Spent the weekend in Michigan, having a great time.  Pics are up on the site.  As usual.  Had a blast and didn't want to leave.  Friday night went out to the Wayside (a bah) and got shitty with a few of Sam's friends.  Met Andi's boyfriend Chris...  Cool guy.  I think we'll all get along.  Good times.  Watched Y tu mama Tambien on Saturday night after a long day of scraping and painting the gas chamber (this room in her basement which is a funky tope color, mildewy and water damaged corner, and looks like a gas chamber, hence the name).  The movie was pretty good.  Very artistic and pretty damn pornographic.  The movie revolved around sexual escapades and didn't quite have the happiest ending, but was a good valentine's movie... for some reasons, anyways...   Took test number 4 this morning in CNA class.  It wasn't that bad, but it sucked because I HATE tests on Monday's...  Just a pain in the butt to ruin a perfectly good weekend by having to study.  Today was really cool though, because my ma showed me all of the stuff that her cousin had compiled on the genealogy of my family.  At least the Scottish side.  So thank you mom's cousin Kevin for doing all the research (he's a writer for the Highlander which I guess is a Scottish magazine, so I would imagine he knows his stuff!).  My grandma's maiden name is Fall, which is Scottish in origin (but from Ireland), while her mother's name was Sparrow (English, but then too, from Ireland).  So Fall was actually traced back to MacPhail (son of Paul) of Clan Chattan, aka Clan of the Cats located at Inverness.  The motto actually is "Touch not the cat bot a glove."  Bot means "without" so its basically "dont fuck with the cats" which I guess is a pretty strong message to anyone who would mess with the clan.  But its cool.  I guess cousin Kevin linked it back to King Egan or something like that, unfortunately I dont have the lineage right in front of me right now and Im too lazy to get it.  It goes all the way up to about the mid 1700's when Sir Andrew MacPhail shook the hand of Bonnie Prince Charlie before moving off to Canada, which I guess means Im a bit Canadian too, but I will have to ask my grandma/mother about the horse raising that side of the fmaily did or something like that...  I digress, so Andrew never greeted anyone with that hand he shook with up till his death.  Crazy stuff.  I also found my tartan, so that means I can wear my colors to my wedding... Or at least I can finally buy a kilt.  Neither of which Sammy approves of.  Oh well.  So  urlLink here is the website for the Clan  and  urlLink this is the MacPhail website .  Very cool stuff.  Check it out if you want to learn more about my lineage.  I was thinking of communicating with the clan, but I kinda feel a bit funny just being like, "Hi, I could be your third cousin 136 times removed!"  Kinda crazy to know that all these people and I share some glimmer of the same genetic material (quite diluted, I know, but still).  Maybe someday I will get the courage to embrace my ancestry.  I think its pretty kick ass to know where you come from.  And if that makes me a big loser, well, its not like I haven't been called that before, so bite me.

      More stuff (yeah, Im kinda bored today)... I took the  urlLink  political compass  test today and found out that I am at a -4.15, -4.25 on the scale which makes me a collective anarchist (or communist libertarian, whichever you want to read it as) along with Ghandi, Nelson Mandela, and the Dalai Lama.  I think Im in good company on that one.

      Ok, so I did end up getting my game.  Cheaper than I was bidding on the first one I got outbid on, too.  $27 with shipping.  Not bad.  According to Jim, I could have gone out to Gurnee and gotten it for $25, but with the gas, time, and tax?  I think I done good.  Some chump tried to outbid me at the last second, literally. But thankfully my proxy was an increment higher than his.  Sucka...  Oh well, time for homework before I lay down some asskicking tonight.  Pending my knee of course...

      ALL HAIL MIKE, KING OF THE DORKS! Ok, so yeah, Im back.  Long time, no see.  Been super busy washing the filth out of old people's asses.  That and being massively depressed by it.  But why am I such a dork?  I hate e-bay... thats why.  Every time I try and get Pokemon Ruby for my newly acquired GBA, I get outbid at the last second.  Im thinking that it just massively sucks.  And I dont want to pay $45 for it because I am very very poor, so hopefully Im trying to not blow the bank on this one... ANYWAYS...  Yeah, today was a good day.  For the first time, I got out of clinicals and didnt want to blow my brains out or drink myself to oblivion.  No one came up to me begging to die or for me to kill them today.  We actually had a shitload of fun.  Me and Shelly (another CNA student) were lucky enough to be sent to Activity Time in the "not-so-bad" Alzheimers unit today.  People were friendly, laughing, smiling, holding conversations, and just thrilled to have us as company.  First, we had to watch Oprah, because some of the women would get pissy if you turned off their Oprah to do activities.  So we did that until about ten.  Then we played ball for a good hour.  Its just one of those really light plastic bouncy balls that you can get at target for a couple of bucks, but the old folks were having a blast.  It was sweet.  A few went off to the other activity part where they were making brownies (special ones (just kidding)) and then the rest of us kept playing ball.  Soon, there was a crowd of people playing ball.  This one old man would whip it at everyone else, but he would bounce it, so no one ever got hit in the head.  And also there was this blind lady, and every time I would put the ball in her hands so she could play, the old man would grab it from her, and just whip it at someone else.  So anyway, the activity lady came back with a set of trivial persuit cards from probably the 60's (as there were very few I knew) and I would ask questions, and if they remembered them, they would say the answers.  So good times were had by all, and we were sad that we had to go back to the other side of the building.  So then lunch time rolled around, and there really wasnt anyone who needed helping that I hadnt had yet, so I waited and was just walking around, talking to those who could respond to me, and I helped one of my favorite residents to walk around the hallways for exercise.  She even got to go outside the security doors, which is huge, because they live in such a small area, it was good to get her out, and she was so excited.  SO excited, she peed herself.  Oh well.  Whatcha gonna do...  All in all, it was the best clinical day I've had yet, and it gives me hope that my job will not always be so horrible and depressing.  That, and it taught me old people rock at playing ball...

      Made falafel tonight.  Was good.  Very good.  Made a killer cucumber sauce with it and ate it in a pita.  Was stellar.  Quick and easy too.  Get the Far East brand.  Oh yeah, besides playing that infernal Lineage 2 beta that I got into, I think I am going to make a web site for TKD.  That, and Microbiology is pretty cool, but my group sucks cause they are all dumb.  I mean, shaking the inoculation loop to cool it after sterilizing?  Good idea... If you're dumb.  Anyways, I should go do something productive.  Like sleep.  Sleeping is good.  Healing is good.  My body is still feeling weird, but I am very loose still.  Cool.    I wonder what Sammy is up to...  I hope Utah is fun.  Oh yeah.  I think that if people are going to spend 10 bucks to go watch Jesus be tortured and killed, then we need to see the bodies of those people who were killed today.  I wanna see the hanging bodies.  Call me sick, but if you want to get affected by something, then you need to see it.  No shelter here.  This is the thanks we get from a people who supposedly are grateful.  Sound grateful to you?  In the words of Mohammed (other crazy instructor who is originally from Iran) "These people are like, yay, Americans!  Thank you!  NOW FUCK OFF!"  Meddlers.  That's all we are.  Now our innocents are dying, too.  But should we care when we kill theirs?

      So today, I just felt weird.  I dont know why.  Body just doesnt like me today.  My body aches, both my knees hurt, I feel like all my nerves are inflammed.  Pain just shoots all over my body.  Is this normal or at least temporary?  I felt a bump on my right forearm.  No idea what the hell that is... yargh.  I joke with my mom and tell her its cancer.  I know Im only kidding around, but it kinda sits in the back of my mind.   what if?  I guess that death is just part of the way of things, but there is still so much more to experience in this life.  I think that is why I sometimes wonder what TJ would be doing now.  He would have graduated this winter and I could imagine that probably now we would be doing weekends down in St. Louis or hanging out down town Chicago.  Just hanging out.  Laughing.  Talking about how the Sox and the Cards are going to the World Series this year, grumbling how much Duke sucks for beating us and how much it sucks that we shot ourselves in the foot in that game, playing darts, shooting pool, and thinking of mean things we could do to Pop once he passes out.  Sometimes, I just wonder...  Life just isnt fair...  So that just makes me want to enjoy every moment Im here.  Frank Zappa was a very wise man.  Unfortunately, he too was taken away from us too early from cancer.  But he said that "We're all just bozos on this bus" and you never know when your stop will be...  Anyways, enough depressing myself.  I felt best when I was running around tonight.  For some reason, my knees were feeling ok, I was very weak, but very loose.  Oh well.  Maybe some sleep will help.

      Today is the greatest Day I've ever known Can't live for tomorrow, Tomorrow's much too long I'll burn my eyes out  Before I get out I wanted more Than life could ever grant me Bored by the chore Of saving face  Today is the greatest Day I've ever known Can't wait for tomorrow I might not have that long I'll tear my heart out Before I get out  Pink ribbon scars That never forget I tried so hard To cleanse these regrets My angel wings Were bruised and restrained My belly stings  Today is Today is Today is The greatest day  I want to turn you on I want to turn you on I want to turn you on I want to turn you  Today is the greatest Today is the greatest day Today is the greatest day That I have ever really known  -Smashing Pumpkins  Great Song.  Lyrics are kinda cool too.  Not saying today was the greatest day of my life ever, but it was pretty good.  Today at the zoo, we got the route change approved, so we had a whole new route.  Was fun.  Actually had to think about the animals and what I was going to say.  Nothing has changed but that.  In some ways, change is good.  But not too much change.  I finally remembered what John was talking to us about in that awesome talk the other night.  He mentioned to try and do something the same for every day.  Same thing, same way, same time.  To be totally consistent.  Its impossible.  He tells us that the body likes routine.  I guess that would explain how you feel crappy when you throw your sleep pattern out of whack.  I dunno.  Lofty goal.  I dunno if I could do it.  Oh well.  Party time!

      So tonight was possibly the best talk John had with us.  How can I explain it?  I cant.  Read Lao Tzu.  Best way to describe it.  It was about perseverance, the nature of things, cyclical life, impermanence, and alot more.  I feel very enlightened now.  Too bad I wont really remember a damn thing tomorrow morning...  Oh well, such is the way of life.

      George W. Bush makes me angry.  ok, politics in general make me angry.  George W. Bush, even more so.  Its just that we have been lied to WAY too much.  I mean, WAY too much.  Politicians lie, but when thousands of people die because of it, then its too much.  Im gonna make a short list of what I can remember off the top of my head what W. has done to screw up:  remember China and how we wanted to go to war with them back in early 2001ish?  Then there was the whole un-American thing.  After 9/11 a holy war (yes, I will say it) broke out pitting the Islamic world with us (even more so than ever).  Instead of saying that there were fundamentalist zealots who hate our way of life, it was the MUSLIMS who hate us.  If you disagreed that all Muslims must die, then you are un-American.  If you thought that the government was handling things wrong, you are un-American.  If you didnt have an American flag tattoo'd to your chest/shoulder/lumbar region, you are most definitely un-American.  Enron.  Enron Enron Enron.  I empathize with Martha on this one.  She gets dicked cause she is Martha Stewart, while these people who fleeced the shareholders out of a shitload of money pretty much walk away leaving a trail of unemployment, destruction, and corporate mistrust in its wake.  Then most notably, there is the WMD fiasco.  The more I hear about them trying to bullshit their excuse for the war, the more it makes me want to punch a Republican.  Saddam a threat my ASS.  Was he a nice guy?  Hell no.  Did he keep the really crazy fundamentalists in line?  Yes.  So is this war going to bite us in the ass in a few years?  Ohhhhh you better believe it.  Ever hear of a guy named Osama?  Wasnt it the government that trained him to terrorize the Russians back in the cold war?  Are you detecting a pattern here?  The best news in my mind comes from the former secretary of counterterrorism talking about how pretty much as soon as Sept. 11th hit, he wanted Iraq blamed so we could go in there guns blazing.  NOW WHAT THE FUCK DOES THIS TELL YOU?  What about the money?  Economy still sucks.  I still dont have a job (HA!).  We are at the highest amount of national debt ever, rich get richer, poor get shit on, we have no social security plan, medicare is in the shitter, the government hired a freelance journalist to talk about the wonders of the new medicare bill that will actually cost us about 150 billion bucks more than we though.  And yet again, we were LIED to.  Tommy Thompson is as big as a screw up as Bush.  Have I made my point yet?   Yes, I still think Kerry is a schmuck too.  But his "I'm not Bush" campaign is still looking alot better to me than W's "I am Bush" campaign.  I am really at a loss for any sort of good or positive thing to say about Dubya.  At least Clinton was doing a decent job as president, so what if he liked getting a hummer every once in a while?  Who doesnt enjoy a good BJ every once in a while?  Im at the point where I dont even care if Kerry kills kittens in his basement in a satanic ritual or eats babies with beans and a nice chianti.  So with so many lies and so many lives lost, what would make you want to vote for W?  No, really.  I want an answer to that.  Please.  Enlighten me.  If you have half a brain, you would realize that I would make a better president than him.  My two year old niece would make a better one.  So if anyone comes up to me this November and tells me that they voted for Bush (A: because they are a republican or B: they dont like Kerry), I will personally punch them in the face without hesitation.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  However, in the event he does somehow happen to win, I will be organizing a mass exodus to Canada.  No, really.  Ive decided that I will give up my American citizenship if Bush wins again.  Besides, less crime, murder, etc in Canada, medical drugs are less expensive, everyone there is friendly, and they like pot.  Who's with me?!?!?!

I look at the links from where people find my site, and one was a google seach for "cures for epididymitis"  Dude, get some drugs (anitbiotics cause usually its caused by an STD if you have any discharge or hemauria - blood in urine or in my case, frequent irritation from kicking), ice it, and elevate it.  Ibuprofin works too if you've got my kind of problem with it.  But I dunno if thats cool, funny, or just plain sick that I come up for that.  Ive decided that Im pretty much exercise bulemic.  Today was insanity.  I went to TKD for 4 straight hours today, teaching both the 4:30 and 7:00 classes.  Did iron body and iron palm in between classes with a ton of kicks, deep breathing, a bit o bench press and butterfly, situps, and going nuts on the bag for a while.  Then at the end of the 7pm class, I did a 2 on one with a couple of black belts.  Needless to say, IM TIRED.  And with that, gonna grab a quick bite to eat and drink a gallon of water as I lost 4 pounds of water weight tonight, then shower and bed.  Yikes.  PS... my nut is starting to hurt again.

      Greetings from Michigan.  Still snowing here, but then again, I guess its snowing at home too.  Oh well.  Happy St. Patricks Day to everyone!  Its fun being Irish on this day, but then again, its fun to be Irish anyways.  I still dont think Im crossing into the realm of overkill on this holiday.  Last year, I drank a bottle of Baileys and a case of Guinness with Steve.  Man, I miss those days.  Even had a dream last night about going to the Lodge.  Was kinda weird.  I miss those care free days where any non class time was spent playing games or just hanging out with the people you care about most.  I find my life is way too boring now, not like it was full of fun and excitement before.  But I go to class, watch Piper, go to TKD, call Sammy and fall asleep while talking to her.  I have too many worries now as well.  I worry about money, finding a job, my debt, my weight, my health, my education, my everything.  I cant help but worry about all these things and where I am heading.  Im sure everything will be ok once the Zoo starts picking up again.  Im not taking class this summer, and hopefully I will make enough money between the zoo and possibly a CNA job to pay off all debt and maybe start some fund of sorts for something special... but then again, Ive been saying that for a year now.  The COD tuition has been kicking my ass.  I know that tuition there is not that bad compared to U of I, but when its all you have, then you worry about how you are going to pay your bills the next month.  I think its time to stop all spending of all sorts, pending gas money.  Oh well.  I listened to others telling me that going to Borders for a month then quitting would be a dick move.  Although right now, I couldnt give a damn, as that would have been an easy couple hundred bucks.  But then again, being a dick at a job that really means nothing to me just shows how immature I am, right?  So anyways, the concert Monday night rocked.  Stroke 9 was great, even though they arent what I would deem exceptional music.  I just think they try to hard to rock out and it makes them kinda standard.  I wouldnt call it emo, but thats the closest thing I could call it.  Sam and Andi had fun making fun of me for not really dancing to the music.  But I just didnt get into it too much.  Phantom Planet, although being scrawny motherfuckers, put on an exceptional show.  Very high energy, doing stage dives, running into the audience, and having a blast while doing it.  I felt kinda weird going into it because for both bands, I have only heard their mainstream stuff, but after the concert, I realized that even that mainstream stuff was alot more than others had known.  Apparently, this was WMU's first big concert ever, so that was kinda cool.  The auditorium was about as big as Foellenger, so it was pretty cool to be that close.  We were pretty much in the back, and it was only row 16. Not too shabby.  Anyways, the people right in front of us left after Stroke 9, and when we were walking out, I overheard this one guy saying "No man, we just came to see Stroke 9, Ive never even heard of the other guys..."  I think thats just hysterical.  I would at least have stuck around to HEAR the other band, even if Ive never heard of them, just to see if they were any good.  it was funny, Phantom Planet was even advertised as "the band that does the theme song to OC"  I can say at least Ive heard Lonely Day, Anthem, Big Brat, and a few more to the point where I could sing along.  But everyone was chanting to hear California, and I think that kinda put them off.  Oh well, cant always please rock stars.  But I had fun.    Oh yeah, the crowd was very funny too.  Not funny ha-ha, but funny odd.  We couldnt really pick out the fanbase.  There were kids who were about 12 with braces (we saw their parents pick them up!).  ALOT of kids actually.  Then there were dirty people to our sides.  I think you know what Im talking about.  The stoners that dress out of urban outfitters and smelled like they havent showered in a week or two.  Then there were the Abercrombie preps who were totally rocking out to both bands.  Drunk?  Perhaps.  Or just really overzealous.  Then there were the punk wanna be's.  Like I said it was a very odd crowd.  I wonder where I would fit in with those in my jeans and t-shirt... ha!  Oh well.    My weekend was fun though (as I go backwards through time).  The Chicago Bar Association puts on a killer big band ball.  Had a blast with Lark (as Sammy calls my "home" girlfriend).  The food was great and the music was great, even though there werent that many people dancing.  But we had fun.  Mary Jo (my other home girlfriend, as Sammy calls her) came Sunday night and we went with Lark to the dojo to teach her some Capoeira.  She showed me the yellow cord she got from Brazil.  I dont care what anyone else says, I think she totally deserves it.  I think that some of the others from Champaign are just really jealous.  I mean, when someone goes to Brazil for six months to train, thats pretty hardcore.  That, and I think she does have the talent for it and really deserves it.  But anyways, the three of us had a fun time, and while there was no roda, I had alot of fun.  I kinda really miss capoeira, but between that and TKD, TKD wins with the time and money departments.  Maybe when I get my 3rd or 4th degree, I will call it quits with that style.  That may be a few years though.  Then I will most likely move on to a different style, hopefully capoeira, maybe wing chun, wushu, aikido, iado, I dunno.  Oh well, Ive just blow enough time writing this to keep me occupied a little while longer.  It's time to get back to looking for a nursing school.

      WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! No more class for a whole two weeks!  WOOOOOOO!  Ok, so thats not so exciting really, but whatever.  So yeah, today I saw a truck go through the car only I-pass lane.  Was funny.  I look over as I pay my toll, and the dumb look on the guys faces (2 of em in the cab) was pretty priceless.  The guy in the passenger side was cringing and they went through, just BARELY clearing the top of the sign.  Then they proceed to scream at each other as I pass them.  Oh well.  I guess you just had to be there.  Silly Dollar General drivers...  Ok, how cool is this?  Phantom Planet and Stroke 9 at Western Michigan on Monday.  How sad is it that Sam got tickets for us on the floor just last week?  I guess they just dont understand music up there like they do down in my beloved Chambana.  That, and tickets were only 10 bucks.  SO HOW DOES THAT NOT SELL OUT IN A FEW HOURS?  Its because they are all very ghetto up there, to my understanding.  Either that or Christian Rock.  I still have yet to find a good alternative station up there.  Its all B96ish, Country, or God.  Although they do have a classic rock station, which does me just fine for the long drive up there.  But still, it kinda amazes me that a show like this does not get sold out just for the simple fact that its only TEN BUCKS!  Maybe Im just jaded from Dave's $50 shows or the $40 concerts at U of I.  Student discount my ass...  Or maybe they just dont know good music when they hear it.  ANYWAYS...  Saturday night should be fun, as Lark has invited me to go to the Bar Associations Ball downtown.  Fancy!  Should be cool.  Then partying when I get home with my little brother.  Then Sunday, Mary Jo will be coming to visit and I get to hear all about Brazil and how nuts it is down there (get it?  Brazil nuts?  Ok, that was lame...).  Then Monday, having a party with the crew from Allied Health 105 (the CNA class) where I get my A and have a party.  Then off to Michigan to have a BLAST AT THIS AWESOME CONCERT.  At least if it sucks, Ive only wasted $10...  Life is swell, now if only the zoo would pick back up.

      Just an update.  Nothing is new really.  Bored.  Sammy went back to the frozen tundra after a great week with her.  I miss her a whole lot.  I painted but to no avail... Oh well.  Maybe sleep will be nice to keep me occupied until my classes are over...

      So, today has been a great day so far.  Its funny how life is so cyclical.  Yesterday I was at a low, and today, Im at a high.  Just bi-polar, eh?  Well, I have reasons for this.  Yesterday I received word that I would not be allowed into the nursing program at the College of DuPage.  900 applicants, 120 spots.  Didnt have my hopes up really, but it still got me bummed.  It just the policy that pisses me off though.  Basically, some stupid little slut with a 4.0 out of high school will get the spot while a college graduate with a degree in systems physiology is left wondering what to do next.  I thought I had some chance though, being A: male, B: a college grad, C: had all my prereqs done.  Oh well.  So life isnt fair.  Or at least the system isnt.  Time to do what I have always done when life doesnt work out the way I've planned...  Move on to the next thing.  So basically now every single nursing program in the state will be receiving an application from me.  Forget where or how expensive, this time Im playing for keeps.    Last night though, was pretty fun.  Hung out with Sammy, Bridget, and Rob (another teacher from B's school).  Nice guy, good times.  We all got really good at playing the erotic photo find game.  Good times.  Also, today was sweet.  Ace'd both my biomedical terminology tests.  Also got a mountain dew and a king sized milky way for $1.13.  Cash register girl screwed up the SKU and then I got my pop for 13 cents.  I brought this to her attention, and since it was probably her first day, the manager was standing right there and told me not to worry bout it.  Bueno.  I like free stuff (the pop alone would have been 1.10!).  Tonight is spending time with the family, so that should be nice.  LIfe is ok right now.  Oh yeah, Ive got epidydimitis.  Bummer.  Sure as hell beats a hernia or cancer.  Jun says its from playing with myself too much.  I say its from TKD, the doc says it just happens.  Needless to say, its a pain in my balls.  No, really.  I was being serious.

      Ok, gonna make alot of people mad with this one.   urlLink This is why I dont like religion.    These people are nuts.  Scary scary nuts.  Even according to them, Catholocism is a pagan cult.  Of all organized religions, and even with the hundreds of years of craziness, I still like the Roman Catholic Church best.  But then again, I dont really know too many others except for baptist and crazy ass hellfire ones like this.  But it really just freaks me out that people are like this.  If I do not agree with a religion or dogma, I will say I dont agree with with it but I will not tell them what to believe.  God is a lie?  Jesus is a lie?  Honestly, I dont know the answers to these questions, and honestly I dont think anyone else has those answers.  No one knows, and all we have is that faith that God is either there or not there.  You can worship the dog poop in your backyard for its ability to fertilize the earth if you would like.  Just please dont go shoving it in my face.  Keen analogy?  Not one religion is right, and until people open their God damn eyes and accept this, then we are all doomed to live in chaos.

      Hi everybody!  I put up some Pics of Emily's apartment warming party from Saturday night where I was a little too drunk to have to wake up at 7 and go to work.  Needless to say, my weekend both rocked and sucked at the same time.  Got to hang out with my friends and the woman I love, but my body suffered and the test this morning left much to be desired.  Oh well.  Anyways, I got a video of Frank doing the "butterfly" or as it is known in other circles, the booty clap.  Email me if you want me to send it to ya!  Peace

      DON’T EAT THE HABANERO!!!  Ass.  Yup.  I’m an ass.  I can’t believe I did it.  After the warning from my brother and the very nice man who brought out our food at the House of Blues tonight, I still had to take a bite of the Habanero.  Its not like I didn’t know how hot it was going to be.  Its not like it was a test of manhood or something that was a challenge to me.  I guess I was just very curious.  One of those things where you just have got to do it, although it’s hard to explain why.  Human nature.  Curiosity killed the cat… or at least gave him horrible diarrhea.  Man, that pepper shot right through me.  Was good though, and oddly enough worth it.  But Sammy didn’t let me hear the end of it… =)  So tonight was awesome.  Now why do you ask “but isn’t it Friday?”  Well, yes, but my internet has stopped working so I am now writing this on Word, to be posted tomorrow (today).  Yup.  This was most definitely the best night I have had in a long while.  Really.  Was super cool.  House of Blues was awesome.  Really good food and a kick ass atmosphere.  May I recommend the Jambalaya and the banana bread pudding.  Killer.  Really.  Just DON’T EAT THE HABANERO.  (Unless you are like me)  During my date, I received a call from Nino saying that he was going to be home this weekend.  That’s cool, cause I miss the boy, and now I get to just hang out.  I gotta call him back tomorrow to figure out when we can hang out.  So yeah, after a wonderful dinner, I happened to run into one Geoff Bacci going to the Better than Ezra concert there.  If I had known that they were playing, I might have bought tickets, but I guess they aren’t high on my list of bands that I absolutely  must   see.  So whatever, we went and saw the Ladykillers instead at the Quarry. Pretty good movie, although I must admit, it was a tad bit over even my head.  Maybe if I had been more in the mood for an English black comedy, it would have a bit better.  But it most definitely had its moments.  Also, the brief ending of the movie was a bit of a shock to me.  Once again, if in the mood, I probably would have found that hysterical.  Oh well.  Learned lots about IBS.  Yup.  I really did have a fun time tonight.  Its nice to be able to joke around again and just be myself.  Not like I haven’t been doing that a lot, but I feel like the myself that I am now is not the myself that I used to be, and I like it better the way I used to be.  I think I just brood too much now.  I dunno.  The more I brood on it, the more I think this way.  ARGH!  Dammit!  Slap me next time I do that.  Well, since my internet is down and I don’t really see any other way of entertaining myself, I think I’m just going to go to bed.  Possibly have to work tomorrow (today).  So to recap: Tonight = Rock    Oh, and asshole, DON’T EAT THE HABANERO  Ride or Die (for GMX)

      Ok, watching Piper again, as this is all my mornings come down to now.  I have ti finish up two more lab write ups, but those will take me about 15 minutes if Im lucky.  Anyways, karma came and bit me in the ass.  I was being a big jerk, and I cut my thumb off.  Ok, so Im lying.  I didnt cut it off, but in my best Iron Chef impersonation, I cut a huge divot in it.  Like, filet.  No flap, just cut clean off with a big hole in my thumb.  Im such a dumbass.  It kept me from going to TKD last night, which kinda sucked because there was NO ONE there.  Literally.  It was John and his kids and then the two little chinese kids that go.  Lark's foot is busted big time (no clue how she did it either).  Ray was on a ride with the Buell group.  Chris was probably working.  I didnt want to bleed everywhere.  Todd was probably off doing whatever it is that Todd does.  Maybe killing puppies or something.  I dunno.  I did end up going later after class and talked with John for a few minutes.  Poor Mitch (John's 3 yr old son) went head first into a rock on Sunday and now has 4 stiches.  Poor little dude.  John just kinda laughs about it and how much it sucks that he had to go to the emergency room on a Sunday.  I told him if it were a few years later, I would have done it for him =)  Oh well.  Yeah, so to get back on the good side of karma, I did a little bit of cleaning up at the dojo.  I wiped off the fan blades which were NASTY.  Covered in dust.  Probably have never been cleaned in the 4 years I have been there.  When I wiped them off, you could see the brown nasty stuff coming off of the blade.  Once again, nasty.  Did that and did the front door inside and out.  I dont really want recognition for doing it, cause its my place too and I  should  do it, but I also want someone to go "damn, thats a good job!"  Maybe Im just being selfish and I should shut up, but I think its nice to be recognized for going above and beyond... you know?  Anyways....  This week has been kinda lackluster.  I thought it was going to be great, but its just kinda turning out to be pretty average.  So many damn mixed feelings about everything going on in my life right now.  Sammy says she is having a quarter life crisis.  She was talking about how its rough to be far away from school.  Not the one she is at now, but U of I.  Life was much simpler back then.  I know that sounds horribly fucking lame, but it was.  It was our own little self contained universe where friends were close, having fun was always close by, bars, parties, class, projects, activities, the love of your life, everything was always in walking distance.  Now things have changed.  Welcome to the real world.  But the fucking sad thing is, Im not even in the real world.  Im in some fucking limbo where my life consists of going to some stupid ass community college, work at the zoo, living at home, and the only thing that keeps me sane, my Tae Kwon Do.  I feel like my life is in a rut right now.  Nothing makes me happy, and the one thing that did has been the greatest cause of stress in my life right now.  It sucks not knowing what you want.  It really really blows.  I dont know what I want, and right now, my goals are constantly changing.  This goal that I spoke of earlier and never eluded to is my new priority.  Im going to be a doctor.  Ive decided that becoming a nurse, while not a bad thing, and I could do it, but its the easy way out.  It was my "be done in 2 years so I could propose, get married, have a career and a life" plan.  Things change.  Im doing this for myself.  I came in wanting to be a doctor, and after all is said and done, Im coming out as a doctor.  I have never been so sure of this statement in my entire life.  So this is the new plan.  My goal.  My dream.  I may have to go it alone, but even that will only give me more resolve.  Now I just hope my meeting with the admissions people at CCOM will work out...  Also, back to COD kinda sucking.  Funny thing:  On the first microbio test, the class average was around a 78ish.  Only three people got over 100%  I was one of them.  Not to sound like an arrogant prick, but I think I may be out of my league.  Who knows.  Or Im just lucky.  Not to mention that class is at a weird time right in the middle of the day, goes Monday through Thursday, and just sucks.  Tonight is going to be fun... hopefully.  At the House of Blues for dinner with Sammy.  Thank you Q101 half price meals.  Nifty...

      This morning while I was outside doing some yard work for my mom, Piper discovered her shadow.  Got a bit of it on my digi.  She is just so damn cute its not even funny.  Last night, I come home from work, and she says "Hey Mikey, youre my best friend."  I nearly wanted to cry.  It amazing how sometimes a 2 year old can drive you nuts and how sometimes they can just make all your troubles melt away...

      "Is something wrong?" she said "Well of course there is..." "You're still alive," she said "Oh, and do I deserve to be? Is that the question? And if so...if so...who answers...who answers...?" ~Pearl Jam, Alive  So today wasnt that bad.  I feel better but not complete on my issues that I have.  But the Zoo was fun.  Worked a wedding that took place during the day.  Weddings at the zoo are funny to me because I dont see how a zoo would be a good place for one, but we have good food and put on a hell of a party, so its cool.  Dont want mine there, unless my fiancee really thought it was a good idea.  I dunno.  Saw my buddy Maggie that wasnt there last year, but did end up coming back (all because of me she says, but she was just kidding... made my day though).  Sue was there and she is so cynical its hysterical.  Tom N. was here today too, and he is funny in what I call the "Tony Tatina" funny.  He doesnt really talk too much out of conversation, but when he jumps in, its usually pretty damn funny.  So since my buds was back, a few of us went out for a beer at an Irish pub like place right off Harlem called James Joyce.  It was fun.  We just relaxed, caught up with each other, and had a good old motor safari time.  Was good to see old friends again today.  Especially since the weekend was so busy.  Work was busy, my mind was busy, my body was busy.  I can only see myself as emotionally and physically drained from this week and weekend.  On a side note, I have a nice sunburn and some color.  I think my body was craving the vitamin D.  So much time indoors and finally some release, to be outside and to be happy to be there.  I also cant wait for next weekend.  Sam comes home and I get to spend some time with her.  Im really looking forward to just being with her.  So much I miss and so much to talk about.  I need this week to recover.  Get my thoughts in line and be myself for a bit...  However I do think I have already made a huge decision about my future...  More to come later as this develops (dont worry, this is a good thing!)

      Acceptance.  I feel like the decision has already been made, even though I dont know the answer.  Ive felt it all week.  Am I just being pessimistic?  Possibly.  I feel like the whole week since last Saturday was here to set me up for the reality of today.  If the answer is no, I will move on.  It will take time to heal.  Probably a long time, and things can never be this way again.  If the answer is yes, then I feel things still cant be the same, well, at least not how it was.  It can become better or worse, but I dont want these recent feelings to stay the same.  I feel so weak right now.  Im so confused.  I just want this world to go away...  On a positive note, the people have spoken (Motor Safari that is) and the Zoo director would not let Jullee leave.  Things are the way they were over there...  For now anyways.

      Yesterday went ok.  One day at a time really.  Today is my boss' last day at the zoo, which really really sucks.  Just gonna have to live with it.  She will be missed greatly, cause she is such a great person.  I feel honored to have worked with her.

      So today is supposed to be a beautiful day out.  70's.  Think Im gonna wear shorts.  I just hope the nice weather does something for me.  Right now, I feel kinda empty.  So much going on, and Im trying to be strong.  Really.  But its hard.  And I dont really know how all this turmoil is going to end, so Im in a constant state of emptiness and worry.  I just have to be ok for a little while longer...  Im very surprised I got this far.  Hell, I didnt think I could do it.  But I did.  And I guess that shows just how I feel.  All I can offer really.  Fate sucks.  John says that the nature of life is not looking at the good and bad things, rather it is the outcome of the choices that we make.  I think that logic has one flaw.  We cant control the choices that other people make.  So right now, Im just waiting on a single choice.  And that choice isnt mine.  Funny how life works, huh?  I guess Im off to take the CNA test I didnt study for, the microbio quiz I didnt study for, and the nutrition test I didnt study for.  If I just live past this day, it will be a miracle.

      Ok, so suck day today.  Everything is ok, then suddenly when Im on my break, Julle comes up to me and tells me she is leaving the zoo.  Basically, our department head is cutting management and taking over motor safari.  Jullee was offered a position, but would not have any say whatsoever in the management process.  There are many other reasons for leaving, like health reasons, but I dont blame her for leaving.  It just sucks that after 25 years of loyal service to the zoo, it ends like this.  Welcome to the corporate world, huh?  Mariann also got booted to admissions, reduced to counting out cash boxes after the day ends.  I came back to the zoo for them, and now my reason to be there is gone.  Therefore, I am gone.  But this doesnt mean right now.  Jullee leaves the 17th.  Everyone else is boycotting this move and plans on leaving when she does.  I am with them.  Although, like I said, not right now.  I still need a job until I get out of school in June.  Then, Im off to start my living as a full time CNA at a hospital (instead of part time CNA, part time MS).  Who knows where yet, but mid-May after I get my official certification, I will start job hunting.  That just blows though.    Secondly, I think my black belt certificate is a fake.  I have my reasons, but I also dont want to make wild accusations.  There is just so much shit going on at the international level.  Head honcho of the WTF got busted on corruption charges in Korea.  Getting to be way too political.  But four years of my life wasted?  But I think of the physical and spiritual gains I have made and it makes me not give a damn about a piece of paper.  Oh well.    So my life has fallen apart this past week, and Im only anticipating it getting worse.  Happy Good Friday.

      Finally finished Lao Tsu's Tao Te Ching this week.  Not a bad read.  I can see why many people find this book very philisophical as it has many gems of wisdom to live by.  It talks quite a bit about impermanence and the nature of life.  From #58 "Happiness is rooted in misery.  Misery lurks beneath happiness.  Who knows what the future holds?  There is no honesty.  Honesty becomes dishonest."  Alot ot Taoism is all about accepting the false idea of the duality of nature.  We say good and evil, but what is each?  How do you define these?  Unlike nature, which just accepts the these actions, humans feel the need to describe them.  I dunno.  There is way too much to get into on this one, and I dont feel like I am qualified to go any further, as I am just touching the tip of this philosophy.    Anyways, off to the zoo for another fun day of animals and the little creatures that we have on display...

      So yeah... Not much has happened lately.  I just cant wait for Easter and seeing Sammy.  So, since it is that Easter season, Im going to go over what Easter is.  According to Roman Catholic tradition, Easter is the day that we celebrate Christ's triumph over death.  It will have been 3 days since he died, and then he will return to heaven on the day of the Ascension.  Ok.  Sound fun, huh?  How about Ostara (aka Eostre).  She was a pagan goddess of the spring (Germanic origins).  Her sacred objects are eggs and rabbits.  Sound familiar?  Well, I dont really feel like going much further into it, but isnt it cool how old pagan tradition survived this far to be associated with a Christian thing?  Anyways.  Bored.  Gonna do something productive now.  Like homework  It was a beautiful day today.  Just wish I could sit outside forever...

      Sooooo what happened to me today?  I got pooped on by a flying rat (seagull).  There was a MASSIVE accident as I drove into work where both cars were totalled in our parking lot.  The day got busy.  People kept bailing from work, so we had no breakers for a good two hours.  Not bad for me cause I was on a 3-car and could switch driving/narrating, but poor Tanya was stuck on a 2-car and just had to keep circling.  Sucks.  Especially since I kinda feel the people who left had bullshit excuses.  Work ended up being really kinda busy after the rain let up.  I have Monday off, which can be a good thing or at least a relaxing day.  I found myself kinda dazed and confused all day.  Fragile, I guess.  Well, not really fragile, but not being strong on anything.  Ever have one of those days?  So Im not doing anything tonight either.  Just gonna lay low and relax.  A bit tired...  Maybe work out, but I just ate some Lucca's pizza.  Best stuff around LaGrange.  So maybe later.  Who knows.  Listening to the best 500 songs ever on Oldies 104.3.  Man, my night is just like my day, randomness.  Just one of those days I guess.    Also I do believe in the quarter life crisis.  I think this is a new phenomenon with our generation.  Perhaps it was in others, but I cant find anyone who says so.  Everyone I know is kinda fried right now with life and how much everything sucks and how nothing goes your way.  Either too much school or not enough.  Either finding a job right away and then deciding thats not what you want to do with your life, or those working temps or menial jobs passing the time until any of the above come along.  I think if this whole thing doesnt work out for me in the next few years, Im gonna travel.  See the country, possibly see the world.  Pipe dreams, I know, but a man can dream.  In the mean time, Im gonna stick to reality and keep working on a CNA job cause those bastards havent called me in yet.  If Im here Tuesday I think Im gonna go physically with my resume to these places.

      So last night I ended up going to Magilla's which is in Worth.  Apparently I have driven by there to go to my grandma's multiple times, but have never really noticed it.  Perhaps because I wasnt of legal drinking age at that time.  But anyways, it was funny.  There were midgets and dwarves and overall little people. There was white trash and underage hotties trying to look cool (this one girl had some spastic dance moves... was pretty funny).  The bar itself was nothing spectacular and it kind of reminded me of CO's a bit with some tiki flair.  Overall, I kinda felt like I was in college again.  But the night was just crazy.  There ended up only being four of us, me, Wendy, Kevin, and Kara? Sarah?  I didnt really catch her name, just that it had an "ara" in it.  I dont do well in loud places with hearing.  Lots of smiling and nodding.  But the night was laid back.  Played some cricket, Wendy danced in the cages they have (by the way, who hires cage dancers?!?!  and how do you get that job?!?!), just drank and chatted.  Kinda felt a bit awkward because the safety net wasnt there (ie anyone I really knew).  I mean, I this is only the third time I have even met Wendy, but she is a cool girl and I guess if she is a friend of Lark's she is a friend of mine.  The other two people I didnt know, but they were very cool.  Kevin is a marine.  Hell, the whole reason for going out was because he is leaving for a nice one year stint in the sand.  Being a marine, he's pretty much a badass, and jokes about being more of a badass when he comes home and scoring chicks with his badassness.  He was also joking around about getting killed.  He was saying that some of these kids are right out of boot camp and how when he was right out of camp, he would have no clue how to fight and such.  And that "if they get me killed, Im gonna be so pissed at them..."  So now the war really has a human face for me.  I wish the guy the best.  Oh well.  Off to work!  its raining and its gonna be a slow one...

      So yeah, can you really blame me?  It was my time, my effort, their gain.  Although, SIXTY BUCKS?!?!  That was a bit much, as 20 would have been cool.  But Im not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.  Besides, the teacher said I should have charged more...  I could do it for the college and get paid minimum wage or I can freelance.  The one lady, Heidi, wanted to give me $20 an hour anyways, so instead of all 60 from her, is was 15 from each for all 3 hours.  Sounds reasonable.  Good deal.  And I hope I helped alot.  They seemed to know what was going on, but now they just need to explain it on the test.  I think I could be a teacher, but I still kinda get frustrated when people dont understand even though you explain it to them 30 billion times in multiple different ways.  But still, it was a really nice feeling when they did finally get it.  So yeah, that and we did Pa Kua (Ba Gua, however you wanna spell it) walk tonight after class.  That is supposed to feel amazing, and I still dont think I get it.  Maybe Im still doing it wrong.  Oh well.  Perseverence.  Try try again.  And all that stuff.  Rock.

      Ok, so who knows how I got screwed into this one, but for some reason I got suckered into teaching a review session for microbio for our test on Thursday.  Somehow, the people in my class think I am smart so now I have to teach them all about DNA and how it works.  I mean, really, I dont know how to explain it... All I know is that this is the billionth time Ive been taught it and its just second nature to me.  So I guess Im just gonna be answering questions and pointing to the book and all that stuff.  Shit, I should probably do   my   studying first.  So thats what Im gonna do tonight besides my normal routine of TKD.  Im gonna blow them away with an extremely difficult (for them) DNA translation problem where they have to realize its backwards, then do the RNA, then look for the start codon, etc etc.  All stuff that I would have no problem doing, but apparently these people would have trouble.  And they arent kids out of high school either, so I dont feel bad.  If they get that, then they are pretty set for the test.  The big thing Im wondering is if I should make them pay me.  The whole thing was brought up because some lady wanted to pay me 20 bucks an hour to tutor her for the test (she's kinda failing and cant blow the last 2 tests to pass the class).  Speaking of which, according to Kim (one o' my partners) she called me "that surfer boy"  Am I really that surfer?  WHAT?!?!?!  So yeah, next thing I know, her entire group and a few others are like "thats a great idea!"  So do I have them pay me?  How much?  how do you judge these things?  HOW AM I GOING TO HELP THESE PEOPLE!?!?!?!  Yargh.  Who knows.  I dont.  And I should.  So thats why Im gonna study tonight.    Anyways, it was a busy morning.  Gave the Porkchop (Wally) a bath with Piper and painted my ceiling with a wicked sweet paint that goes on pink and dries white so you dont miss any spots.    Also the weekend was good.  Birthday was good.  Saw Shrek 2.  Hilarious.  You must see.  Its way more adult than the first one, or at least they dont hide it like they did.  My buddy Joges' (Melissa) wedding was fun.  Very different, but fun.  Punch and cake in the basement of the church after the ceremony.  Music, but no dancing allowed.  Besides, a bump and grind would have been most unholy.  Founders Day was cool too.  Lots of drinking.  Multiple gin and tonics and such.  That night was lots of fun too.  Hung out with Beth and Tom like the olden days and spent the rest of the night just talking with Sam.  Woke up, had to recover, did some stuff, went to get sushi with Lark over at the Sushi House in LaGrange.  Killer.  Was awesome stuff.  Must go there more often if not so damn expensive.  Lark told me all about driving through a tornado, canoeing through the grasslands (thats how flooded it was) and about the juggler she likes.  Crazy.  Well, I should get to my studying.  Fun times..  fun times...

      So last night was probably the most comfortable I have been in a long time, even though I was really nervous driving up.  I didnt know if she was even going to be there or if she was going to be excited to see me or whatever.  At the door Im greeted by a kiss and a "You're nuts..."  Mission accomplished.  I had a nice night even though we did homework and it was just so great to spend the night with her.  Last time I was up there was two months ago.  Too long.  Too long...  I cut her grass then left this morning, taking her toothpaste with me.  Why?  I dunno.  Accident, but sounds funnier if I make it sound like I took it for a reason.  Im just stupid.  Oh well.  Made it all the way to class in nearly 3 hours and was on time.  SUCKS THAT WE DIDNT GET STARTED UNTIL 1:20.  I hate my teacher for that.  If Im gonna haul ass to get there, we might as well get going on time.  Really... how annoying...  On the bright side, I did get my project done so now I have no lab stuff to do for the rest of the year.  I can live with that.  So yeah, Im just really excited for the weekend now.  As hectic as its going to be, it should be a phenominal time.  Tonight, off to Tae Kwon Do and the black belt class.  Should be a late one tonight.  Dad says he has a project for me when he gets home too at 10:30.  Im a bit curious.  Maybe I should take a nap before I go.  Lots of driving today.  Oh yeah, I love my little brother.  Just cause he is cool.

      So yeah, whats new in the world of Mike?  NOTHING!  Ha!  Was a boring weekend at the zoo.  Nothing major, just the billions of kids on Friday, barely anyone on Saturday, and billions of people Sunday.  Its always funny when you are trying to leave at 6:15 and people come up to you asking for a ride and then they get all pissed off at you cause you tell them that the zoo closed 15 minutes ago.  Go figure.  Saw the Last Samurai Saturday night.  Phenominal movie.  Its gotta go into my Samurai collection of movies... ok, so that collection only consists of Seven Samurai from Kurosawa, but hey, its a start.  So my week will be a very busy one.  So much to do.  Places to go, people to see, people to meet, things to finish, movies to watch, alcoholic beverages to drink.  Who knows.  Tuesday I have a nutrition test.  Wednesday is our second black belt class, so should be fun. Friday is my brithday and apart from the 300 busloads of children at the zoo that day, I may want to have a bit of a party.  Going out.  Nothing major.  I dunno.  Either that or I just want to see the new Shrek.  Im easy to please.   Saturday is a buddy's wedding and the Founder's Day banquet for the Lodge.  Sunday is for recovery... Who wants to go to the zoo?  Not me... hehe.  Ok, time to get working!

      So I wont lie, today at the zoo was kinda nuts.  7000 screaming kids all jumping on and touching the trams.  Little anklebiters...  But the teens are worse cause they at least think they are cool.  Anyways, I never get fun email anymore.  I look forward to opening my inbox, and for my one account, I get billions of spams for porn, and on the other, I get my Borders newsletter.  Kinda lame if you ask me... Oh well, this really isnt a complaint, its just more of an observance.  Got paid.  Gonna go throw it in the bank.  Later.

      So today we cleaned out our attic in preparation of a HUGE garage sale and I finally got to my paints after nearly a year of trying to find em.  Ok, so I knew that they were in my box of college stuff, but to get to it in the rafters was nearly impossible behind all the stuff from my grandmas and Jim and Jun.  Oh well.  So tonight I finally finished a long overdue picture.  I realize that my skills are not quite the best, but I hope to learn.  Oils are a bitch, thats all I can say.  I think I really like acrylic better during the painting process but I think that there is something about oil paints that just screams art.  I dunno.  Hard to explain.  But apparently my dad used to be a painter, and I saw lots of his stuff.  He has a bowling ball bag full of paints and brushes and he even has a gigantic roll of canvas.  Something to put to use.  Should be cool.  Lets see how inspired I get over the summer.  Maybe I should start by watching that Ross guy... You know.  Happy little clouds, majestic trees, etc etc.  He can help me get in touch with my inner hippie.    Oh yeah, I did take pictures of the masterpiece with my camera, but no unveiling until the rightful owner gets it back.    Colorful Rock.

      Jeff is right, the new blogger just feels funny, but I guess it will grow on me the more I use it.  Anyways, I still have this uneasy feeling about everything in my life.  Who knows.  Nothing has really been the same for a while.  Always on my guard about EVERYTHING.  No really.  Like today in class I was kinda paranoid that someone was looking at my test.  Not like I really care, but still, it was just this weird feeling.  I just feel uncomfortable with everything.  Talking to Sam, talking to my parents, talking with other people.  Situations I just want to avoid.  The application process is still ongoing.  Pain in the butt, but thats what I must do if I want to reach my big goal.  It raining.  Im uncomfortable with the weather.  I thought it would be nice and 70's before humid and 85.  My body doesnt like it.  Sam's quote on her IM is "The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers."  This comes from M. Scott Peck.  But I cant see it.  Im so uncomfortable with everything its not even funny and its only getting worse.  I feel unfulfilled.  I feel empty.  I used to go to people for reassurance, for these truer answers, to know Im loved, but even if they say it, I dont feel it.  I know what I want, but I dont know what Im looking for.  Anyone have one of those days?  Yeah.  Sorry.  I know this is alot to dump on an open forum, but its how Ive decided that Im going to be.  Heart on my sleeve, no lies, no bullshit.  But some things are better left unsaid.  Too bad you dont even know the half of it...  So the real question is, so now what?

      Today, I heard Ryan Adams do a version of this on Q101's diamond in the rough (Thank you Woody, Tony, & Ravey for the awesome music that you guys find).  Anyways, Im never surprised how much music can explain how a person feels at any given time.  Today is gonna be the day That they’re gonna throw it back to you By now you should’ve somehow Realised what you gotta do I don’t believe that anybody Feels the way I do about you now Backbeat the word was on the street That the fire in your heart is out I’m sure you’ve heard it all before But you never really had a doubt I don’t believe that anybody feels The way I do about you now And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead us there are blinding There are many things that I would Like to say to you But I don’t know how Because maybe You’re gonna be the one that saves me   And after all You’re my wonderwall Today was gonna be the day?  But they’ll never throw it back to you By now you should’ve somehow Realised what you’re not to do I don’t believe that anybody Feels the way I do About you now And all the roads that lead you there were winding And all the lights that light the way are blinding There are many things that I would like to say to you I don’t know how I said maybe You’re gonna be the one that saves me   And after all You’re my wonderwall I said maybe You’re gonna be the one that saves me   And after all You’re my wonderwall Said maybe You’re gonna be the one that saves me You’re gonna be the one that saves me You’re gonna be the one that saves me  Ok, so Oasis rocks.  Anyways, if anyone cares, Im willing to open up my blog and let others post.  Just cause I dont always have the most interesting things to say.  Just lemme know, and if Im in a good mood, I can hook you up.  Although lately, Im sinking back into the darkness, but the new motivation is still blazing within.  Metaphorlicious.  I dont know whats up with me.  I always joked about being the sane one in the family, but I think I need some Zoloft or Paxil or something to take the edge off.

      Ok, one more thing I would like for my birthday:  A massage.  Im so damn sore right now its not even funny.  But last night, such an awesome event took place.  John got his 5th degree.  So what does this mean?  He is now a master.  Took him 17 years of martial arts, but he is finally a master.  Last night at the test, it was so amazing, I cant even describe in words how much he has dedicated to the full understanding of every movement he makes.  It really was something special.  So a bunch of us went to go celebrate with margaritas, after all, it was Cinco de Mayo.  Good times.  Ok, off to class now.  Fun stuff.  Oh yeah, the birthday list is just what I think I want, not necessarily what is needed.  Cause its all pretty expensive.  I dunno.  Whatever.  Back to the grind.

      Lots going on today.  Or tomorrow for that matter.  Lets start at the beginning.  Today in Nutrition we learned all about weight management and whatnot.  Basically, I learned that Im going to be fat forever.  Fat cells never go away, they just shrink.  Then the moment you start to eat too much again, you get fat faster.  Hence the reason why when you do the quick diet, you end up gaining more back.  The key is the whole behavioral modification thing.  I have to change the way I eat or I will never be at least somewhat thin.  Hell, I dont wanna be 180.  200 will be very nice if I can get there.  Still 20 more lbs to go.  Yargh.  Also learned that abdominal fat is the easiest to lose.  And upon remembering that, Im a huge asshole.  I will just leave it at that.  Anyway, enough with all the fat talk.  Todd is getting his black belt tomorrow.  Im sort of annoyed.  It makes me wonder if my 4 years of training were enough or if he just passed me cause I was paying.  I test again tomorrow for the next step.  Think I might not do the next test after that for another 4 months.  I want to redeem myself by commiting all the Taeguks to memory, as well as the first four Palgues.  I want to make sure I am where I am because of my skill, not because of my money.  Todd is also going into the army at the end of the summer.  Im very surprised why anyone would do this in a time of war.  But hey, its his life, not mine.  I just hope he doesnt get blown up.  I wouldnt wish that on anyone... yargh.  So also, I have decided what I want for my birthday. 1.  256 MB SD card for my digi (about 80 bucks) 2.   urlLink Two Iron Palm bags for beginners   3.   urlLink Music  Yeah, thats all I can think of really.  Right now anyways.   urlLink Oh yeah, go here.  This is funny.  So true though.  Aight.  Im outtie.

      So.  A few things I have learned this weekend: 1.  Dont water down your parents alcohol.  It just pisses off your older siblings when they actually want to get drunk.  At least have the decency to kill the entire bottle before filling it back up with water.  Only drinking half of a bottle of vodka then filling it up with water just ruins the bottle.  Dont do it kids.   2.  Morning Relief works like gangbusters.  TIme of transformation?  Half an hour.  But apparently it makes you feel like a new person.  Good call. 3.  Still dont eat the Habanero.   4.  Bill's attempt at reading multiple books this summer is quite the feat.  I think I will stick to my Cat in the Hat and Go Dog Go, thank you. 5.  Time goes way too fast when you dont want it to, but drags on forever when you want it to go by.   6.  I complain about not having a social life, but when something comes up, I make excuses, like Im too tired or dont have the money.  Fucking slap me if I do that to you.   7.  THEY TOOK OUR JORRRBS! 8.  Ive come to the realization that Founder's Day is going to be a big celebration.  Not only of getting together with friends, but also of my brithday being the day before. 9.  I still dont know what I want for my birthday.  Dont get me anything.  Or maybe money.  Money is nice.   10.  The zoo is slow on beautiful days like today.  Whats up with that?  I mean, sure it was a bit chilly, but overall, it was a pretty sweet day to be out and about. Ok, well, I guess its time for bed.  That and Im too tired to remember things going on right now.  Oh yeah, after 3 months those bastards are finally getting around to fixing the hott tubb.  Awww yeah.  Hott Tubb... Gonna make you sweat!  Derp.

      So what to do, what to do?  Had a fun week.  Good times.  Busy.  Maybe I should start studying for my tests this week.  I have nothing better to do really.  That or play videogames.  And I feel like being productive today for some odd reason.  Im glad my little brother finally saw the light.  He was getting REALLY pissed off by Dubya.  Like, it was affecting how he was living.  He realized yeah, you gotta fight the power, but that doesnt mean you have to give up living your life the way you want to.  I think he was getting a little too into politics and lost sight on what is really important: life.  I mean, politics are just so corrupt and evil, its not even funny.  And its our own damn faults.  We train others to blow us up.  Good call guys.  So it bites us in the ass, innocents die, and the fat cats keep getting fatter.  But the average person wont do a damn thing to stop the cycle.  The smart ones try, but their cries are drowned out by the drooling babble of the inept.  I hate to say it, but its kind of an endless cycle that will ultimately lead to the destruction of America and possibly a revolution.  When I look back at it, I think 9/11 should have been a HUGE wake up call to everyone, but it wasnt.  It only made matters worse.  It told all of us that we are the best, and no one can fuck with us, everyone else is wrong, and we should just keep spreading our way of life like the virus it is.  Instead of enlightenment, we spread napalm.  Dammit, now Im getting all mad.  Ok, Im gonna stop now before I join some crazy ass political movement.  Regardless, just live your life, fight the power, but dont forget that life does come first and you should try and enjoy it as much as possible.  Yup.  Oh yeah, zoo party at Ledo's was a bit out of control.  Played Galaga with Sue.  She is pretty damn good at it.  Funny cause she is about 15ish years older than me and she said it reminded her of when she was a teen.  Just funny in my mind.  Whatever.  Zoo called, Im going in later today.  Rock.

      Yeah, so my dad got done playing his game so I actually have a minute to write!  Then Im going to bed.  Had a super weekend.  So yeah.  Sam taught me a trick on how to induce vertigo in someone using cold water.  Makes a neat feeling that I should try on Tony some time.  Pour water in ear, close eyes, count from 100 backwards by threes, get dizzy, good times.  C2.  SUCKS.  Really, when I first got it, I thought I could handle it, but the more I drank it, the worse it got.  All it is, is half classic, half diet.  Im sure thats pretty much it.  Real brain buster with that one...  You still get that nasty phenylalanine aftertaste so youre better off just drinking the diet, cause the taste is pretty much the same.  Must say Im somewhat disappointed just because I thought that it could be good.  New Found Glory.  SUCKS.  All downhill from here is worst song ever.  Or whatever you call it.  I think it was Sludge the other day (or maybe it was Fook) but pretty much it was someone on Q101 making fun of Dave Matthews voice then plays these chumps.  I mean, really.  The lead singer sounds like part of the lollypop guild.  High nasal punk/pop makes me place these guys with the likes of Avril and Good Charlotte.  Lame.  People or Orland Park.  SUCK.  "Oh no, we dont want a mosque cause the taliban is gonna move in!"  Grow up people.  Really.  What would Jesus do guys?  He would accept them and love them and blah blah blah.  But still.  Being scared of Islamic people?  What is this world coming to?  Equating terrorists to Moslims is like equating all Christians to Jerry Falwell.  Not all Christians are as big as assholes as him, and not all Moslims are gonna blow you up.  End of story, now quit your bitching.  Tortilla Soup.  RULES.  Still.  The White Sox.  RULE.  (Sorry Cubs fans)  I got to drive around some of them today at the zoo and I must say they are some of the coolest people I have met.  Not to mention as he gave me his autograph, I told Jose Valentin to kick Cleveland's ass tonight.  Then he did with that 2 run shot in the 10th that pushed us over the edge and won it for us.  I would like to claim all responsiblity for this.  No, really.  This win was all because of me and my motivational speaking (just let me have it, ok? ok? please? thanks!).  Lollapalooza (or however you spell it).  minisucks.  Was cancelled due to poor ticket sales.  I would have gone cause they did have a pretty sweet line up, but no one huge to draw the crowd.  No sales = No show.  Bummer.  That, and two day venues just dont work so well.  At least in my mind.  Make it a week or something and I will go.  Woodstockish.  I dunno.    And I do probably have alot more, but I should go to bed as it is late.  Oh yeah, my friend Julie got engaged.  She was the one who caught the bouquet at Joge's wedding.  Odd.  Maybe she is next.  She deserves a cookie.  Didnt know that acutally happened, with the tradition and all.  We even joked with the guy saying he should get a ring.  I guess he did.  Well, gotta work tomorrow, so if I figure out more, I will write manananana.  JOSE ROCK.

      Sup everyone.  Greetings from Michigan where all day today I havent done much.  Ok, so I think I may be lying, but I dont feel like I did much today.  Im sure I did.  But Im just kind of enjoying the quiet time.  Time when I can just sit and think and do nothing.  Listened to music, watched some Food TV, made some KILLER tortilla soup (I think I outdid myself this time...), and just got to relax while not worrying about anything.  Its nice to just zone out and not think about the problems of the world today.  No family, no distractions, no worrying.  Just me.  I never thought I would say this because I love human interaction, but its just nice to be by myself.  Gonna relax and pick weeds in the garden (yes, I kinda find that relaxing, ok?) and then maybe some early dinner then a softball game which hopefully hasnt been rained out!  Sorry I havent been writing too much.  Just too busy I guess.  Oh yeah, go to the zoo and see the new wolf exhibit.  It rocks.  Some time, I will arrange a field trip if people are interested.  Just lemme know.

      I may have already said this, but do you know what has caused all the evil in the world today?  TV's in SUVs.  Pointless.  I dont know how else to say it.  Pointless.  Really.  It makes me very sad that you parents cant go for a fifteen minute car ride without putting on some sort of entertainment for those in the back seat.  I mean, really, WTF mate?  I just dont understand it, our constant need for the media and television and how we just plop our children in front of moving pictures instead of letting them use their brain.  I MEAN FUCKING REALLY!  A car ride:  Probably the biggest chunk of conscious time in our life when we arent subjected to the TV.  Now that has changed.  Now if you want, you can rot your brain in the comfort of your Escalade that consumes enough energy to power your house for a month.  And THIS is why all of our problems arent solved.  This is why people want to blow us up.  Cause they dont have enough food to feed their family and we watch TV in our fucking cars.  And this is added to Mike's Agression list (cause it makes me crazy and no, I wont punch anyone, its just symbolic of the things that I find wrong with society).  Yargh.

      Why oh why am I going to wash my car even though its going to rain?  But now that the bloody alarm is off, I can do it in quiet without having to hit the alarm button every 2 minutes.  So I guess that is good.  Today is the day.  I can feel it!  For what?  Who knows.  Have a stellar day kids!  Rock Rock on!

      Oh man.  Jim and Jun and Piper are moving in...  My dad was readying the mud room  all yesterday.  Put in wainscoting or whatever the hell you call it.  Then they get to paint.  Then they move in.  Jim calls it saving money.  I CALL IT INSANITY!  Everyone is back.  So all five Kings will be together again.  This time plus a fiance, a baby, and a grandma.  Oh man...  This is gonna get a little nuts around here.  Kinda want to be alone for a while.  Or maybe not alone, just without my family for a bit.  Too much.  Too much going on too.  Yargh.  Also I have been falling asleep really early lately.  Maybe its from getting wiped out at work or I have the west nile.  Birds have popped up in Berwyn.  So its pretty much inevitable.  Crazy amounts of work I would imagine.  I mean, what I do is some what physically demanding (extreme heat) and definately mentally draining (between tours and driving not trying to kill anyone).  Whatever.  Making excuses.    So anyways, yesterday was my dad's B-day.  We made him a special cake.  Suzie-Q cake.  Jim had the brilliant idea to frost it, but that was a BIT overkill on the sugar.  Had to throw half of it away.  I will get around to putting the pics up eventually.  Craziness.

      So yesterday was a good time.  Kids in the Wild, so I was only working until 10:30, which is slightly better than midnight.  There was food for 100 and only about 65 showed up, so needless to say we were fed (very well might I add!).  Manuel (aka Bob, yes he calls himself Bob) from Africa took care of us Europeans (as he says it, You-ROW-pee-ans).  Good guy, that Bob.  Saw the wolves too from a distance.  Still havent gotten to go into the exhibit yet because they are dumb and the employee preview was from 3 until 5:30 when I was working.  DUH.  So yeah, oh well.  Tonight was cool too.  Lark bailed cause of a wedding she had to go to, so I took Tony and scrounged up an extra ticket for Jeff.  Was good times.  Hung out, had too many hot dogs, and drank beer from Peru.  And that brings me here.  Im hot, tired, stuffed, and have to work at 7:30 tomorrow morning.  I think I may shower, relax, and call it an early night.  Que Bueno.  Roca.

      Ray Charles died today.  Thats kind of a bummer.  I think its even more sad that Im more saddened by this than of the death of Reagan.  Also whats with putting his face on the 10 spot?  Or Mt. Rushmore.  I dont think that he made big enough contributions.  Except to the national debt.  Oh well.  Nothing is new except I am now done with COD and now the real stress is on.  For a job and for a program.  Starting Monday its time to rock.  Should be a good weekend though.  Work until midnight tomorrow.  Saturday has the wolf exhibit preview and the zoo picnic.  Excited for that.  Grandma is here and that brings alot more responsibility.  I mean, yeah, Im a CNA, but its different when its someone you care about.  Not saying that I dont care about my patients, but Im a lot more cautious and careful with her than just anyone.  I feel like this place is more of a hotel than a house.  I think I need to get away too.  Its starting to wear on me a bit.  Feeling uncomfortable again, not with others, but with myself.  Crawling feeling.  Wanna jump out of my skin.  I HATE THIS!!!  Drives me nuts.  Oh well.  Best go to bed even though its early because it will be a long weekend.  Hopefully a good one, but I know it will be long...

      So busy today.  Not so busy that I cant write though, but its gonna be a small one.  This morning, got the oil changed, put on some new wiper blades, and GOT THE BLOODY ALARM REMOVED!!!  Yay.  Finally.  For those of you who didnt know, my car alarm goes off if you breathe on the hood.  It would be set off by trucks going by, snow plows, low flying airplane/helicopters, etc etc.  It would even go off in Michigan if Sam's stereo was too loud.  Needless to say, I never need an alarm where I live and it was just a nuisance.  So good riddance.  Sweet.  Also today is the day.  Grandma is moving in to spend her final days surrounded by people who care.  Sounds kinda morbid, huh?  But I mean, I would rather die with my family than in some home or hopsital.  I wont lie, I will give it to the end of the summer if not sooner.  Atypical parkinson's blows and I wouldnt wish that disease on anyone.  Life is becoming more difficult, and she knows that the end is near.  I can even put some of my CNA skills to use (and no, potty breaks are not happening, I mean more like painting nails or spending time with).  Ok, well, whatever.  I might miss TKD tonight to move her in, which kinda makes me sad cause I feel like Im neglecting that lately, but oh well.  Family comes first.  Now, on to school.  One more week.....  sweetness.

      Time to write the saga as I rock out to a little music a la my extensive collection.  First off, might I say that Im sad that I have never discovered a band.  Sammy claims John Mayer, Jen Jordt - Maroon 5, me - nothing.  Maybe Breaking Benjamin, but they havent quite hit the midwest mainstream, although I think they kick ass.  They ended up on Q101's ear candy cd, and just because of that and the other huge list of sweet music, I think I might go snag myself a copy.  But if you want a solid kick ass CD, go buy Saturate and then their new one coming out at the end of the month.  Looking forward to it.  Anyways, on to the Festivities:  Got out of work on Sunday fairly early.  The weather was crappy and there wasnt a damn person at the zoo all morning, so they released me.  After that, I took a shower and high tailed it up to the lake.  Had a wonderful sloppy joe dinner (Mrs. Low makes really good sloppy joes and I think they are from scratch) and then had a few coronas and a vodka tonic.  Thus it begins:  We then proceed to this little place called the Legacy that the girls had hung out in the previous Friday and found their favorite waitress.  Ok, so she was the only waitress they had ever had, but still.  She was cool.  There were some pretty hard core country Karaokers rocking out.  We did Jello shots, drank beer.  Sammy had her razmatazz.  There were some twin kids there, obviously way too young to be at a bar, but whatever, I guess they were the owner's nephews or something?  I dunno.  Anyways, they kept coming over to the table with stuffed animals that they won from the crane machine.  Sam then recruits them to win some toys for her, but with no luck she then tells them to stop wasting their parents money cause they are just gonna sell the toys at a garage sale anyways.  Classy.  True, but classy.  Then the one gives her a yellow elephant they won and Sam thought it was the cutest thing and all night she was saying "you gotta bury me with this when I die!"  It was funny.  So we then leave and go to BT's.  We drink downstairs, we drink upstairs at the VIP bar.  We play Keno that is played in pretty much every bar in the state of Michigan (its run by the state's lottery), which I think is a  brilliant   idea because you take advantage of the drunks of your state and hit them up for even more money.  Stellar.  Really.  Illinois could do that in Chicago and make a KILLING.  Screw a riverboat casino, fleece the drunks!  So we drink more, go back downstairs, drink more.  Dance.  Drink more.  There was a guy playing video poker (which is also for real cash I think), and Sam slaps all his buttons and he kinda freaks but then is like, whatever.  I think he was cool with it cause we werent some randoms, but relatives of Aunt Nance.  It was funny.  Then we leave (after 2 hours which we thought wasnt that long) and head back to the Legacy to finish off the night.  They sing Monkees, I laugh.  Im singing too, but just from my seat.  Listen to the video and I'm fucking God awful.  Sam and I get funky on the dance floor until I drop her, and then the bouncer comes over and says "you guys are drunk and just stumbling everywhere, so go sit down."  Being all embarrased that we got yelled at and Sam all pissed at me for dropping her, we go back to our seats.  More Karaoke, more hanging out, more drinking.  Met some girl who went to high school and hung out with this kid that I hated in grade school cause he was one of the kids who constantly made fun of me.  Not that I really care about him now, cause I would at least hope he is a different person, cause I know I am (Im more aggressive!  Right Sam?), but whatever.  I hope I wasnt too much like, "I hate that fucker" or something like that.  I could  have been, but I dont remember.  So we went back to the house after they kicked us out at close and I had to have lots of water.  Didnt help.  I was not going to have a pleasant night unless I did the unthinkable:  I made myself hurl.  Four years of the Lodge, and it takes me my girlfriend's parents to get my drunk enough to puke.  Man, thats kinda nuts...  Monday, I spent the day recovering and moving a tree limb that fell (it was pretty big, had to break out the chainsaws).  We had Sam's B-day dinner and then went back to her place.  Spent Sam's birthday mowing her lawn and doing some yard work.  Mr. Low did more stuff for the new bathroom in the basement.  Sam had work, unfortunately.  Then Mr. Low took off, Sam came home and we went out to dinner at the Fieldstone Grille.  Good stuff.  Very fancy schmancy.  Not black tie fancy, but still, very nice. Sat out on the patio, watched the rain fall, had a great dinner.  Then we went back to her place and watched a few movies.  Well, 1.5 really.  Saw Brother Bear which was cute.  Typical Disney movie.  Then we tried to watch Love Actually, but ended up falling asleep halfway through it cause it was super late.  Oh well.  Then Im a dumb ass and returned it today, but we did get 2 of the 3 rentals free, so Im dumb, but no money was lost, so whatever.  The third movie I watched this morning before I went home:  Bubba Ho-tep.  Bizzarre is the only word that can describe it because its about Elvis and JFK living in a nursing home in Texas and a mummy who has been sucking out the souls of the elderly through their asses.  Fun time.  Elvis is "posed" as a former impersonator who he switched places with, and JFK is an old black man who says he was dyed after the assassination attempt to get rid of him for good.  So they fight the mummy and win, and its just kinda ended up being about dying with dignity and how we live.  Fuck, actually, Im reaching and have NO clue what the point of the movie was.  Pretty good though.  Good acting and it was pretty funny in parts.  So then I drove home, took a shower, went to class, got a 107% on my test from Thursday, went to TKD, did a new tai chi form (Par gue or something, not really a tai chi form, but some variation or something, I dunno or something).  Had dinner at the golf course with the Tony.  Gonna go to bed now though, cause I have to watch Pips early while my ma goes out to breakfast with Val.  Good times.    Wild Rock.   PS:  Pictures are up on the right and any movies that you feel you might want to see, check out my getfile on AIM.  Just to warn you, I was drunk.  Quite drunk...

      Ok, so tonight, my other grandma dies.&nbsp; WHAT THE FUCK!?!?!&nbsp; Both in one week?&nbsp; Man, this is too messed up.&nbsp; I dunno how I can handle this.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; On my vacation of all times too, so that cancels that, and not to sound mean, but I really wanted to get away and relax for the first time all summer but now I cant do that.&nbsp; Im very mixed on the whole thing.&nbsp; On one hand, she is my grandma.&nbsp; Thats my father's mother.&nbsp; She was a pain in the butt to him, but it was his mother.&nbsp; On the other hand, I had no real great memories of her like I did with the other grandma.&nbsp; She didnt like me, she didnt like my mom, and she would give the other boys money and me nothing, but of course my dad would split it up three ways cause he's awesome like that.&nbsp; And I think Im most sad that there was no closure like with my other grandma.&nbsp; We said our goodbyes and were at peace with everything.&nbsp; This time, it was cold and institutional.&nbsp; She just crashed, heart and kidneys&nbsp;failed and that was it.&nbsp; No goodbyes or anything.&nbsp; I even feel horrible because I havent talked to her in a while except for briefly on Tuesday when she heard that my other grandma died.&nbsp; I dont think there was anyone from the family when it happened.&nbsp; Maybe my uncle was there, but I dont know.&nbsp; And I just think of the two and realized the duality of this, just like nature.&nbsp; Sometimes its with the ones you love and a familiar place and other times, its alone and in a strange environment.&nbsp; You wonder why our culture has a messed up perception on death and dying and things like that.&nbsp; Well, when I get home, I will burn my incense, meditate, and try and be at peace with the events of the week.  Sam had a good point.&nbsp; At least it was fast.&nbsp; No drawn out illness, no pain that I know of, just like going in your sleep.&nbsp; Its the only thing I could have hoped for.  Oh yeah.&nbsp; Funny story about dinner tonight with Kristin and Ryen.&nbsp; But that is for a happier blog.

      Sorry it has been so long.&nbsp; But things just keep happening and I havent had time to write.&nbsp; Not to mention, I still have to pretty much fight for a computer to check my email and such whenever I get home from work.&nbsp; I just finished some yard/house work for Sammy and now I have time to kill before she gets home.&nbsp; So now where to begin?  Work too has been getting very lame and I think this is most definately time to move on from the zoo.&nbsp; The head of our department is on a massive power trip and is trying to make our lives miserable.&nbsp; We all stood up and fought for Jullee, and now its payback.&nbsp; We have been severely understaffed and when Dan came back from Alaska early, they REFUSED to rehire him because he had a moving violation in February.&nbsp; Also, since when does going on vacation take you off the payroll?&nbsp; Granted it was a 3 month long vacation, but still.&nbsp; Insanity.&nbsp; They are cracking down on uniforms which is understandable.&nbsp; They are also cracking down on cell phones, which I understand, but if I am on break and away from the public, I will be damned if I cant check my messages.&nbsp; Our department head came and caught Matt the other day and he got written up for it.&nbsp; Bullshit.&nbsp; I read the policy.&nbsp; It says that the cell phone rule is enforced when the person is on duty, and our break is off the clock technically, so&nbsp;fuck her for saying that Matt was in violation.&nbsp; And now the last straw just happened.&nbsp; It used to be at the zoo that you could bring your family with you&nbsp;and as long as you were there, you could all get in for free.&nbsp; Now, you cant even get dropped off inside the zoo.&nbsp; Anyone not with a badge is denied access.&nbsp; So now theyre saying I can take my family to the Field Museum for free but fuck you if you want to go to the zoo for the afternoon.&nbsp; I just dont get it.&nbsp; They are REALLY trying to cut all employee benefits to drive us away.&nbsp; I think I understand it though.&nbsp; Drive away the people who keep coming back, like myself, to get a whole new crew every year at the lowest wages.&nbsp; Sneaky.&nbsp; Also makes me lose alot of respect for the zoo.&nbsp; However, we are fighting back.&nbsp; Documentation of everything and any violation we see, hear, or encounter goes down on record and the proper authorities will be contacted.&nbsp; So you push us, and we push back.  Tony went out on tour.&nbsp; I guess its going pretty good, but I havent heard much from my bro because he plays every night, sleeps in a van, doesnt eat, and is sick as hell now.&nbsp; He is cutting the tour a bit short by coming home Thursday because of what else is going on.  Grandma died on Tuesday morning.&nbsp; We knew it wasnt going to be long.&nbsp; All of us were here.&nbsp; Leigh came back, Karli is in town, etc.&nbsp; We all got to say goodbye and then that was it.&nbsp; It was eerily calm that morning.&nbsp; We took our time calling hospice and everyone else.&nbsp; It was just really peaceful.&nbsp; I woke up around 4 that morning and knew it was over.&nbsp; Leigh said she woke up at 3:30, Jun said 3:30 too.&nbsp; I guess I just sense these things a bit later.&nbsp; We all did our own little things.&nbsp; Dad made his fire.&nbsp; I burned incense.&nbsp; Jim went to work.&nbsp; We even did a sage smudging ritual on the house for my mom.&nbsp; Look into that if youve never heard of it.&nbsp; Native American purification ritual.&nbsp; Very cool.&nbsp; Mom is still very sad.&nbsp; She takes stuff out on me and I dont blame her, but she yelled at me the other night for wanting to make a pizza for dinner.&nbsp; I didnt quite get it but whatever.&nbsp; Now adays I just hug her alot and tell her I love her.&nbsp; All I can do really.  Tae Kwon Do is insanity.&nbsp; I feel lame for not keeping up lately, but I have had other things to do.&nbsp; Im back up to 225 which makes me sad, but I know as soon as I get the chance, I will be back in full swing and that will drop in no time.&nbsp; So yeah.&nbsp; Also I found out the plan that Mohammed is trying to do.&nbsp; I found out that Todd is his little lackey in the matter and is snitching to him.&nbsp; And I wonder what their friendship is because every time I talk to Mohammed, he is making fun of Todd.&nbsp; But I guess they hang out, so whatever.&nbsp; I have gone back to not trusting Todd.&nbsp; I feel kinda sad about this, because I was just starting to accept him as a person.&nbsp; Now I feel like what the both of them are doing is sneaky and underhanded and I wish they would realize the values that we strive for, the same ones that I based this site on, are found by hard work and dedication, not on what a piece of paper says you are.&nbsp; So in&nbsp;my mind, they are nothing but neophytes in the world of martial arts.&nbsp; They are in it for rank, title, and the ability to hurt someone.&nbsp; To feel power over others.&nbsp; To feel superior.&nbsp; Makes me sad really.&nbsp; As for me, look to the right and see my quote to&nbsp;understand why I do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now off to do&nbsp;some stretching and possibly a light work out on my own.  Oh yeah.&nbsp; I ripped my pocket&nbsp;on my shorts and now I am sad.&nbsp; It happens...&nbsp;&nbsp;

      So where the heck do I begin?  Life has been quite insane the past few weeks.  Busy.  Working at the zoo five days a week now.  Busy on my days off.  Trouble touching the computer whenever I want to write anything, because even though there are two of them, I never get the chance to use either.  Ive spent alot of time with Sammy lately and that has been a blast.  Enjoying the simple things of summer.  That and coming home to pass out after working all day.  TKD has been cut down, but I hope to pick that up in a bit.  Not much I can do with that, as its just getting harder to get there after work.  I mean, I get out at 630 when class starts, so I end up going late and I just dont get the workout I want.  Oh well.  Im rushing and drifting.  I need to realign.  Set my life on the center and work from there.  Stay with the present.  When I rush, bad things happen.  Right Sam?  hehe.  I still feel like a moron for that...  What it is, its so dumb, Im not saying.  Ok, well, off to enjoy another summer pleasure.  Gonna take Pips to the splash park that just opened up by my house.  Nothing fancy, just a good way to get wet and enjoy the afternoon.  Yup.
