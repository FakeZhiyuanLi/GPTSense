      Working at a large, entrenched company is sometimes difficult.  It would be extremely tough to be a salesperson in this company because it is hard to find the correct resources.  Lay on top of that the struggle for revenue and sales credit on every deal and it leads to a tough environemtnt to accomplish results.  I'm on this call right now in which two organizations are fighting over revenue and justifying their place on a sales in which I was instrumental in closing.  It boggles my mind that the same executives that are sitting on this call arguing over credit for a deal would change their tune when it comes to getting their own team members (employees) to jump into a tough situation.  Then we would hear "let's win one for the team".  When a guy that has been at the company for five months is providing direction to a team that average 20 years that could be an issue.  That is to say direction on process, approach...versus simply vision and leadership.  That's it for now...not completely clear.

      5:45 a.m. went for a nice ride on the mountain bike.  I thought about a lot of things...how I shouldn't be so rough on my daughter, Hailey.  She's a wonderful kid.  It seems as if she's struggling to figure out who she's is.  It's tough some times.  Toying with work.  Significant discussion with the delivery and SBLS team today, but I'm not sure what to tell them.  The group needs a serious motivational speech -- morale is really down.  They've been beaten up quite a bit in the past 18 months.  Well, it is off for the shower and a strong day at work.  I wish I could get the damn VPN login to work properly.  That's part of the problem with working in such a large company, the support is B-R-U-T-A-L.  I don't know how many people I hear about that have problems with computers for days and weeks at a time.

      OK...I've been thinking about doing this for a while.  I've been reading about blogs and wondering, why the hell people do this; however, I'm starting to understand.  I'm now working for this behemoth of a company and I need an outlet for my extroverted nature.  That is NOT to say that my family and friends aren't wonderful outlets for that, but there is nobody to speak with about the line between professional and personal activities.  This is the start of an interesting adventure.  As with many things in my life, I'm not sure that it will continue.  We can only hope.  I don't even care if anybody reads these things.  I simply need an outlet.  I'm toying with the notion of starting a book.  If I don't do that, my kids will hopefully be able to read this and understand some of the things that I go through.  I'm going to start with a couple of basis precepts: 1. I love my family, most important thing -- I'll write about them often. 2. Holy phrase -- variety is the spice of life 3. Work is important, but a means to an end. 4. Close friends are as important as family. 5. I'm sporadic and impatient, but always interesting.  I hope you enjoy reading these daily or intra-day posts to the blog.  I hope I'll enjoy writing them.

      I'm in the midst of my first international trip for Big Blue.&nbsp; A very painless Sunday morning flight to Tokya Narita airport today.&nbsp; I was concerned that there was not going to be much english to read on the signs and I was somewhat surprised.&nbsp; Most airport, street and informational signs flashed both Kanji and English. &nbsp; The bus trip to Yokohama was also fairly easy; however, the time difference was hitting me pretty hard.&nbsp; I thought I was going to drool on the Japanese gentleman next to me.&nbsp; I met Susan and another employee of mine today...Linda.&nbsp; Linda is going to be very important for the resilience team. &nbsp; The registration for the conference and the cocktail reception is at 7pm this evening.&nbsp; I'm sitting in my hotel room switching television stations between a Queen retrospective and CNNj.&nbsp; During the flight I watched Hidalgo (not a bad movie) and Jersey Girl (Ben Affleck has some serious career rejuvination to do). &nbsp; Anyway...that's it for today.&nbsp; I'll check in later.
