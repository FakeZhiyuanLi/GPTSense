       I don't even know his real name, but there is a blog out there written buy a guy of amazing talent. I could read his poetry and his proses for the rest of my life and never have to worry about eating or sleeping again. His poetry gives me such an energy, and keeps me coming back for more. He has given me permission to post the below, and I encourgae you to check out his blog to read more and see the amazing photographs he has taken... urlLink airspaced.        Black Eyes    When I'm coming home I'm being watched  A thousand tiny glass lines wind the road  Through a phantom hole in the city night  Black eyes wathcing me    Follow me, follow me  Then we'll see, then we'll see    When teh pale face of the barren moon  Turns to burn the inverted day  I can't feel it in the same way as   Black eyes wathcing me    Why should't we why should we?  Why don't we why don't we?    Whne I'm exhausted from the burden  I struggle to accept my birth  I'll curse the sky and curse the earth   Black eyes watching me     Take it in, take it it  They'll begin, they'll dig in    When I'm down to my last stand  And I've finally given all I can   When defeat is all I have  When I know they've driven me mad  I'll turn my head and look up high  Turn me black eyes to the sky  However pale, every time  Black eyes watching me.       Sirens    The organs that are joined in me create a sound. I can hear it as I try to sleep at night. Beyond the simplicity of the heartbeat, I can hear each part of my body performing its function. But not like you might imagine, the crude squelching noises one can hear when they press their heads against a lover's stomach in those moments such people share. I can hear a hum. An audible hum. Whilst it is very quiet, I can make it out if I concentrate long enough. And it's not just a single hum, like a fridge or a microwave or a white noise, but different frequencies creating a harmonic sound. Almost like guitar feedback, but so quiet and harmonious... almost like running a damp finger around the rim of a wineglass. Each part of my body has slightly more or slightly less water, but these other-wordly sounds fit together regardless of their actual frequency. They just fit. When I am well, I can feel these notes resonating in every cavity of my body, up my bones and my spine and into the base of my brain. They form a chord, a harmonic sound that soothes me to sleep. I imagine the things making sounds as small glass orbs, suspended within some dark space within my chest, rotating slowly and making their song gently and peacfully. And when I hear this noise I think it is the sound of my soul deep inside of me, soothing me to sleep.    And when I am low I can't hear a thing.

        You may all know him from Lord of the Rings as Aragorn. But believe it or not Viggo isn't just an amazing actor, he is also well known for his poetry, his artwork, his photography...After seeing him in the movie    A Walk on the Moon     I did some research and found out about his many talents. Since then I have fallen in love with his work, and I would now like to share some of it with you. My profile picture is also work from Viggo Mortensen, it's called Wolvenbosch.         Sun Losing Its Yellow, 1998        Lost 2, 2000        1045, 1998        After Darkly Noon, 2002     Keepsake     Still unused,   the letter opener   she got on her birthday   has become tarnished.   It lies on the sill,   next to a seashell   she found in Flordia   before moving west.   Before becoming a writer.   Before becoming a mother.   Her son wants to use it   as a dagger,   to wield it savagely   against monsters and bad guys   that come streaming out   from the toy-cluttered corners   of his room,   but he can't reach it yet.

       A while ago, my sister and her husband went up to Seattle and I watched their son for them, so they bought a few things while they were up there because I refused to let them pay me for it. One of the items they brought back was a painting called 'Mind Cloud' by an artist of the name Brian Doogan. I fell in love with the piece instantly, my mom said it was scary and she 'didn't understand how I could sleep with it in my room' But there was something about it that just drew me to it. I have done MANY searches in the web to find more by this artist, and had found nothing. Today I randomly decided to do a search and found websites everywhere! I was so excited! Some of is pieces I don't quite understand, but others I'm intrigued by. Feel free to let me know what you think...here is a website where you can see more of    urlLink Brian Doogan's    work.      Scream Tree, 1995    Mind Cloud, 2001    Elders, 2004

      I went downstairs to do the laundry today and hoped to maybe catch some of the Olympics while doing it.  But no...I came downstairs to find that my dad was once again watching a Western.  I realized that westerns are as plentiful as trees in Yellowstone National Park and like my mother once said...seen one tree seen them all.  This definitely applies with Westerns.    The men always look dirty no matter what.  Does no one believe in showers?    The good guy always seems to go thru 20 guys, shoot them all, and come out completely unharmed...is that realistic in any way?    Random people always get hung, and even more random people always like to watch it.  How sadisatic were they!?  Women are hardly involved and if they are, they are practically helpless!  I won't even get started on this one.     There is more to come...I promise, lol.

      Everyone should watch this show.  It is absolutely hilarious!  It's comedy with a little bit of drama involved.  I know ur thinking, another reality show?  But trust me, it is well worth it.  If it makes you happy, you can just shut it off for the 5 minutes they vote people off, and then turn it back on for the end when they have the stand up stand off.  So everyone tune in tonite!  And vote for Kathleen or Gary, I love them!

      I have 2 years left in highschool, and I am already stressed about college. Which college do I want to go to? Someone help me! I'm not even sure what exactly it is that i want to do with my life. I'm really interested in psychology, sociology, and philosophy; and I absolutly LOVE history, well European history anyways, and I was thinking about it and I would love to become and anthropologist and/or an archaeologist. A job that combines my interests into one, so I've been looking into Universities and colleges and I really find The University of Manchester interesting. I go to their web sote atleast once a day and am seriously thinking about possibly applying there. The only thing is I live in the US, Manchester is in the UK, it would be really hard for me to leave my family and friends and move to a whole new country, knowing there would be a possiblity that i wouldn't be able to raise the money for a plane ticket to go and visit them during holidays and what not. But I would absolutly love to live a new life, in a new place...get a fresh start. And I have always wanted to travel (especially to europe). I'm really starting to realize the fact that in order to get into a good college I need to do good in highschool, so this last semester as a sophmore I've really buckeled down and I'm getting into the habit of studying for tests intstead of just winging it, and I'm doing my homework so I can understand whats going on instead of just to get the grade. And now I find myself enjoying classes, and school is...well it's always been easy for me, but its easier. Wow, now I'm excited for school to start up again, lol. Now if you'll excuse me I have some College Research to do :-)

      I just finished reading They Yellow Wallpaper (by Charlotte Perkins Gilman) for the 100th time, it's a great story and I always notice something i have never noticed before each time i read it. I'm reading The Da Vinci Code (amazing book so far) as well as The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (again)at the moment and after those books I think I'm going to read A Brave New World. I'm a bit of a book worm...If you ever need a good book to read let me know I'm sure I could recommend something to your likes. And feel free to recommend books to e anytime.

      What a fun game! I have to say, I don't know my way around the church as well as i thought I did...now let me tell you of my injuries... I ran into many walls, a drinking fountain, about 12 ppl, and I was tackled many many times. I have a bruise on my knee and one on my hip, and I got a bloody nose from running into a wall full speed,yeah I uh, took a corner to soon...and when we were playing i got tired from running the whole time so I layed down and my brother came running full speed towards me and kicked me in the head...I was pretty dizzy after that. And the whole game, my friend paco (his real name is phillip but we call him paco cause he's mexican)thought it was fun to hide  and then scare the crap outta me when I walked past him...yeah but I am sore all over. But it was great fun. I'm going on a youth trip this monday-friday and we're going to play it again. only it'll be in a building no one is familiar with...I can't wait I want a black eye or something REALLY visible, then I can tell people i got in a fight...or something...now if you'll excuse me i have to go beat my brother in Halo.

      I'm sure a lot of people are sick of hearing about this movie...but I thought it was an amazing movie, I enjoyed it. But when you think about it, it was kind of pointless (you'll understand what i mean by this when you see the movie). But to warn those that don't appreciate things like this there are a few nude scenes, and sex scenes, and plenty of swearing. But if you can get past that, it was an all together good movie. I recommend if you get the chance to watch it. Girls, watch it with someone, lol, it's not scary, but it'll be better if someone is there with you.

      tonight i'm getting together with my youth group for freaky fridays (its a highschool group, all the highschoolers get together and just hang out and have fun and be dumb...its good stuff) and we're gunna play a game called "Communist Church" yeah i've never played before but i guess you play in the complete dark and you have to find this tiny flashlight before the "communists" take you to jail. It's basically a mix between sardines and jailbreak (I'm going to assume you know how to plays those two games). It should be fun because we're playing it at our church and our church is fairly large and has many things you could run into and get hurt by. I dunno what it is but I enjoy getting bruises and scars from random events. Then after that my friend is gunna come over and stay the night and we're gunna watch  The Butterfly Effect, yay for that, then tomorrow I'm going to go see a movie with another friend, not sure which movie, prolly Anchorman, then sunday I am going to go see King Arthur with my brother, my friend and my friends sister. So there is my weekend. Right so I'm gunna go, in the words of Michelle..."Have Fun, Make Good Choices."...bye

      I am so scared at this moment in time...i don't think i have ever been this freaked out by previews for a movie before...   urlLink http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thegrudge/site/   ...i think i was more freaked out by the thing looking at me than the actual preview though, but i am still terrified and can't wait to see the movie! but i must say the scary thing looks like Samara off of The Ring, which only makes it scarier, it means she's back. I'm gunna cry. Michelle, don't watch this trailor alone, you'll die, actually just wait until you come over to watch it...then we can freak out together.

      ...is THE most sick, twisted, demented movie I have ever seen in my life. Excuse my language, I don't usually cuss, but I mean the only way to describe it is, it's a f*cked up movie. Oh my stinkin' goodness. For those who haven't seen it, It has Elijah Wood and Macaulay Culkin in it, and they were both about 10. Elijah's mom dies and his dad has to go on a business trip so he has to live with his aunt and uncle for 2 weeks while his dad is away. Well his cousin, Macaulay Culkin, is this weird, sick, demented kid who enjoys killing people....I was watching the movie and I felt so sick, I mean physically sick. I thought I was going to throw up, no joke. Elijah and Macaulay were good in the movie, especially for being 10, but I never want to see that movie again... Who in there right mind would write something like that???

      ...Equals good times. Wednesday at Camp, we had a mud fight, oh my stinking goodness it smelt like butt, tasted like crap, and stung when it got in you're eye. But it has to be the most fun I have ever had. We walked down to "the beach" and found that it was not a beach afterall, but a mud pit....haha, it all went down hill from there. I wasn't going to participate...that didn't last long, I was COVERED from head to toe, i want to tear up my backyard, and have a mud fight for my birthday (which is in two weeks!) .  By the way, I've decided that I'm going to talk about my camp experiences, throughout different posts, otherwise you would have one long ass post to read. So, thats all for now.

        yay! I just got back from summer camp! I had an awesome time, but I have to say I am very happy to be home. During summer camp, I took a hike meant to last an hour in 20 mins, got completley sun burned, drank more mountain dew than any numan should ever be allowed to consume, and mud wrestled. I'll talk more later about all the great fun I had, but for now I need to go to sleep, I'm running on 2 hours of sleep here...

            I'll be gone this monday-friday (19-23) I'm going on a youth trip to the Seattle area, I'll be back late friday night. I'm excited for it, it should be fun. I'll get to bond with a bunch of girls from my youth church, hopefully build new friendships. AND I get to go to a Mariners/Red Sox game, I not partial to the Mariners (especially not this season) and the Red Sox are okay (I would rather see the White Sox), but I love baseball, so I'm excited for that. And then we're going to Pike's Place, yay for throwing fish!! I'll post about everything we did and probably put some pictures up (speaking of that...how do you post pics, lol, i don't know how). So until Friday, goodbye all and have a good week...and Michelle, I'm so sad you're not going! I'll call you every night! I'm bringing my cell just for you! ;-D

      Michelle, you're right, I always seem to find the most random movies. First  The Good Son , and now,  The Talented Mr. Ripley . Crazy Movie. Matt Damon (Tom in the movie) is the star of this movie, and he finds this guy Dickie and starts acting like him, and then kills him and then takes over his life. The he kills this guy Freddie or Frankie or something because he's about to blow Toms cover, and then he is about to kill Gweneth Paltrow's character Marge, because she is going to blow his cover, but Dickie's dad loves and believes Tom, and gets the cops to back off him. Then he I think falls in love with this guy Peter, and you think the movie is over and Peter and Tom are going to live happily ever after, but all of a sudden he kills Peter...WTF!!! I'm going to have to read the book because I was really very confused by the movie. And I'm still trying to find out if Tom was homosexual or not, because you never could tell. Yes, so I'm off to the library now to go get the book because I have to find out what the heck was going on...bye...okay I just saw that is 11pm, okay so I'll get the book tomorrow...

      The Mancheter United-AC Milan game just got over, and uh...I wanna cry. Man United lost.  They went the whole game ahead 1-0. So I'm thinking 'heck yeah, we got it won.' Then...in the last full minute of the game, Milan decides, lets piss ashley off and score a point. Which by the way THEY DID NOT DESERVE. STUPID REF! The ref made a bad call and gave Milan a cornerkick, Okay, not to bad, they'll go onto penalty kicks and with these 2 teams it'll probably end up with sudden death. Well first kick, both teams 1 point, second kick, both teams miss (Keane, you're better than that!) Penalty kicks are rolling by, both teams making every one, so it comes to sudden death. Both teams make it. So they continue with the penalty kicks,  final score...  Manchester United 1-1 AC Milan Milan 9-8 PK  GRRR. Tim! he was expecting you to go for the right corner, everyone went for the right corner, he KNEW you were going to go for the right corner!! Why'd you have to go for the right corner?  Another game lost for United, But Scholes did play and that made me happy. He's my favorite player, that man is a beast! He's small, but you look at him and you just know he could take you out. And he's the one who scored for United by the way.

       WOW, amazing movie. I haven't been on edge throughout an entire movie in a long time. Even if you're not into technology and stuff like that (like myself) I think you'll enjoy the movie. It was funny, it had action, it was sad, Michelle if you were there with us you would have been crying! It's a great movie, definently one I'll buy. Lots of twists, I thought I had it all figured out but I was completely wrong. But one thing about the movie...it's going along telling the story, building up to the climax, and then all of a sudden you're there, it almost seems like there should have been another 5-6 minutes of anticipation before everything started happening. But that is just my opinion. All in all, great movie, Will Smith was hott in it, as in all his movies, I enjoyed it.     Sunday I'm going to go see The Village. I'm excited fot it. My brother is freakin out, he's afraid haha! He's turning 21 and he's terrified to go see this movie! I'm afraid too, but it's more of an exciting scared, but that's because I love scaring myself. A couple of friends of ours are going with us, one who's not really afraid of anything, and then his girlfirend who is already on the verge of tears. I love seeing 'scary' movies with people who are completely terrified, it gives more of a...dramatic effect to the movie.     Oh I also saw Hellboy tonight...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. Unbelievably boring. Anyways, I'm tired and would like to get some sleep. I'm getting up early tomorrow to catch Man. United play AC Milan!! The game starts at 10. okay okay so it's not early, but what do you expect from a teen who is on summer vacation and sleeps all day??

       Nicky Butt has officially left Manchester United for Newcastle...I saw him play his last game wearing a red jersey, and it makes me want to cry. No, no just kidding, but I am pretty sad he left, he played for Man Utd for 13 years.     But I have to say I am very  ANGRY  with United right now. They have lost there 2 games in the USA Tour!! 0-0 against Bayern Munich (lost by penalty shots) and a 2-1 loss agianst Celtic....WHO LOSES TO CELTIC!?!?! But I can tell you why we're losing all our games... FERGIE IS AN A-HOLE!!! He left all the star players at home to "rest" because they just got done with Euro 2004. BLAH BLAH BLAH! They are football (soccer for you americans) players, it's there job! But he has wised up...a little bit, for there last game here in NYC he is bringing Scholes and Silvestre in. With O'Shea and Keane already here we stand a much better chance. But I do think it would be wise to bring in Saha and Nistlerooy...Grr...

      PB 'n'J (grape of course) with pretzles and lemonade. I haven't had this in forever. That's what I had almost every day for lunch in elementry school, with one of my mom's brownies or sugar cookies of course. Yup me and my plastic power ranger lunch box, or my babrie one, or My Little Ponys, I had quite a few...I alternated days.

        so i got a sun burn on top of my sunburn today...pain, and i got the snot beat outta me by five guys with those pool noodles...pain, and I somehow managed to get a bug bite on the bottom of my foot...pain. I'm a pansy, I know, but everyone knows that :-) . yeah so tomorrow I'm grandma-sitting, it's like baby-sitting but only I'm watching a grandma instead of babies. These people who live across the street from us need me to stay with Eleanor (the Grandma) and I really don't want to do it, but these people do so much for our family, so there is no way could have said no...well that and my mother is making me. But it's all good, I was told she sleeps all day so I'll just bring a book and read. Okay so yay for ashley! My birthday is in two weeks and we're gunna have a huge-ass party, and and we're gunna decorate my backyard, and have food, and lots and lots of people ( I think the count is only 30 people so far), and it'll be great fun and I'm excited. I love turning 16. I get my tattoo, and my car keys, and my license, and my new cell phone, and lotsa money! I'm so excited!!! Oh and by the way, I'm not materialistic I swear, lol. I'm excited, I want to have like this HUGE Cinderella Ball, but then people would have to go rent tuxes and buy dresses, and I'm not sure everyone would be able to afford that. But yeah, I gotta go so I can make my invites cause I still haven't done that :-/...

      I hate being sunburned...I HATE IT. It hurts, but it's not as bad as it was. See I fell asleep in the sun...I know, I know stupid me, but i had good reason. See, two of my friends are going out. Which is awkward, you'd understand why if you knew these two. And no one else in our little group of friends understands why they are going out, because they don't have a boyfriend/girlfriend realationship, all they do is kiss and hold hands and make out. I dunno, it's just weird, and everyone is just waiting for them to break it off, which will only make things worse for the rest of us because then two of our friends won't want to hang out with the other as much if at all. I don't know how to explain it all but it's just weird, and I'm sick of it. ANYWAYS, the point of my story, We went to Enchanted Village ( Water Park an hour from Seattle) and I got sick of watching my friends make out so I laid down, put a towel over my face, and then fell asleep, in the sun, therefore getting burned. I was so red, it was sick, now it's just my shoulders that are red, but they still hurt...a lot. So there is yet another story from my camp experience. More updates later...

       So I'm sixteen, and I almost didn't have sixteen candles on my birthday cake, we were one short. So my friend decided she knew exactly how to fix it. She took one of my smelly candles, like the ones you buy at a store and light to make your room smell nice. Yeah, so we had 15 regualr candles and then big fatty in the corner. It was nice, My party was so much fun! You only turn sixteen once, and let me say THAT is exactly how I would want to do it. I mean it wasn't antything extravagent, but all my friends were there, and we just had fun. Atleast I did, I hope everyone else did! There were a few people who couldn't make it and that really bummed me out, but it's all good. I went out for my birthday lunch today, we would have done it yesterday but there was so much going on. We went to Olive Garden, God I love that place. But I always get full after the salad and breadsticks and end up taking more than half of my main meal home. Oh jees, So yesterday at my party, two of my friends disappear, okay you'd think I would have been suspicious because these two particular people don't really like each other all that much, and all they had to do was run home real quick and then come back, but they were gone for like and hour if not longer. They get back, and I don't remember why but I went to my room   for something and I open my door and there is something sticking to my feet. I turn on my light and my room is COVERED in rice, jelly beans, garbanzo beans and candy corn. I mean it's EVERYWHERE. All over the floor, in my bed, in my pillow cases, in my drawers, all in my furniture, not one place in my room where there was not rice. Rice is not fun to clean up, really it's not. AND they hid two open cans of sardines in my room. I wasn't to thrilled about that on account of I have two cats. WOW, what a pain. Funny, but not fun. So I'm going to go see King Arthur with some friends today for ym birthday and then sunday I am going to go see Collateral with my brother for my birthday. My birthday so far has lasted 3 days, I love it! I got 75 bucks for my birthday from friends, and then 200 from my parents, I'm going to get my tattoo within the next week, so Michelle, you have convince your mom that I need you there! Tell her I'm scared or something and I need my best friend there! Right so I have to call Hoops to see what I need to do in order to get my tattoo and how much it'll cost, and all that, if I have enough money I think I'm going to get me nose pierced...no, just kidding I'll get my job first and then we'll see what their thoughts are on a nose ring...Right, phone, gotta go.

      YAY! 2 DAYS UNTIL MY BIRTHDAY!!!  So I know i have mentioned it a lot, and I kind of let you know what I was going to do, but here are the details. A couple of friends are coming up early to help me decorate my ENTIRE backyard in white christmas lights,  it'll be so pretty. Then a bunch of people are going to come up there will be a barbeque, swimming - speaking of the swimming, I wrote on my invitations, "There will be a barbeque and the pool will be open so come hungry and bring a towel!" (I know, corny, so sue me) So all of my guy friends say they are coming to my party with JUST a towel. And you laugh, but see, my guy friends are the kind of people who will actaully do it. SO I AM TERRIFIED! The neighbors are gunna get pissed because I told people that they could leave whenever they got sick of me, it doesn't end at any particualr time.  So that should be fun to deal with in the morning.  But yeah, that's what my friday consists of, getting ready for the party.  Now tomorrow I'm going shopping with a friend of mine because his girlfriends birthday is also on friday, and he needs help buying her a present. I went shopping with her when she got him his birtday present and now I'm going shopping with him, for her. It's great being the friend. And I think people are coming over tomorrow night, but I'm not sure, I don't remember.., guess I'll find out tomorrow!

       Okay, so I found     this kid's blog  , and it is one of the most hilarious things I have ever read. This kid is my new hero, seriously, check it out...    Anyways, not much has been going on, my best friend and I have been hanging out the past two days, haha, great fun. And right now I'm getting ready to go outside and tan a litte, my birthday party is this friday, so I gotta look good ;-). Then I have to get ready for youth tonight. My youth pastor is out of town and my brother is preaching tonight! It makes me happy, I love my brother and I love it when he preaches. But yeah, that's the deal for today. Oh! my bruise on my shin from the last game of Communist Church is MASSIVE. I'm so excited! lol    One more thing, now that I have had time to digest the movie "The Village" I have figured out my thoughts on it.  DO NOT READ THE BELOW UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR ARE PREPARED TO HAVE THE MOVIE SPOILED FOR YOU ...    It was all in all a good film, M. Night Shyamalan did a good job in writing and directing this film. The twist at the end was a clever idea, even though I walked out of the theater angry because of it. I think I was mad because going into the movie, you think you are about to see a horror film about these creatures and this village who are no longer able to keep the peace between themselves, and you that the creatures are going to attack and it will end up being some huge war between the two, like signs, where the good guys win and the movie will be over. But instead you get this huge twist at the ending and you find out everything is fake and it's just about these people who are fed-up with the world and want to create their own life and their own world, and have the money to do it without being disturbed...and I when I go into a horror movie, I like to walk out of a horror movie. Not some weird physchology experiment movie. So now that I am over it, lol, I can look back and see it's not a bad movie afterall. And I have to say, I'm kind of happy that it was all fake, because I was let down by M. Night when I saw what the creatures looked like. I thought he could do WAY better than that.

      I'm still trying to dectide if I liked it. It was a weird movie. And NOT AT ALL what you think. Seriously, you will think you have the movie figured out...but ya won't. Out of all 4 of M. Night's movies, I'd say it was his 4th best. I can't say anything about the movie because I will give things away, but I do encourage you to see the movie because it's one of those movies that you have to see just so you know what happens. ..  Last night we played another game of Communist Church. It was great fun. I got thrown against a wall, I ran into a row of chairs, I got 14 ppl out of jail and then ran past 3 communists (all waiting by the 'church') and made it to the 'church' safely (The 'church' is the safezone for the christians). I have a HUGE bruise on shin (from the chairs) and another on my foot (from getting thrown against the wall). Yes...great fun.  One more thing, you have to check out  urlLink this site  and watch the video. It's really pretty funny no matter what party you're associated with.

       Dear Fellow Bloggers,    I had a CRAZY night. I was at a friends birthday party, and my best friend was tackled by another friend of mine, and we had to take her to the hospital because she hurt her knee, it turns out she was just being a weeny, they did x-rays and all that and it turned out it was just bruised, they gave her pain killers and told her to ice it for the next few days. She's fine though she's even going out to Denny's in a few minutes. I was going to go to the hospital with her, I called my mom to tell her, and my mom said no, and then I got pissed and left mt friends birthday party and went home, only to get in a huge fight with my mom. Not fun. But things are okay now. So I called the kid who tackled my best friend to let him know that she was okay and to not feel to bad. Well he knew because they went back to the party (yeah, I know weeny). And I think he tried to ask me out on a date. My best guy friend in the world, just tried to ask me on a date. It's okay that I'm weirded out yeah? He asked me what I was doing tomorrow, I told him nothing, then he asked me what I was doing tomorrow night, and I said nothing (curious as to where he was going with this) and then he asked if there were any movies out that I haven't seen. I told him i didn't know (completely freaked out by this point in time) and then he asked if I wanted to go see Alien vs. Pretator with him tomorrow. I asked who all would be going and he said just you and me...That's not normal for me and him, yeah we hang out one on one, but we never just call each other up and then go see a movie with each other...A question for all the guys out there,   did I just get asked out on a date by my best guy friend?     -Confused in Washington

       So I walked into my mom's office, and there she was reading my blog...my first thought was crap...did I cuss at all? I did...and my mom now knows I cuss. She was shocked about it, but she just laughed. She said I was 16, and I don't think she really cared all that much, but I know every parent likes to think that there kid is this perfect little angel, so I kinda ruined that for her. Hmm...I wonder if this gives me the liberty to cuss in front of her? HAH Just kidding mom! I don't cuss...well I do...but...only in my head.  : / Right then, have a good day all, and Man.Utd lost to Arsenal, I saw that coming, but still makes me sad. And mom, I won't ever use the f-word again, it was just the only word to describe that movie....k, bye.

       Wow, amazing movie, in my opinion anyways. It didn't have the best fighting seens and it didn't have the best love story, but if you want to see a movie for the historical aspect of it, King Arthur is the movie to see. It was the most accurate movie I have seen about King Arthur and his Knights. But then again, with so many different legends and stories around, what is accurate? But I love how the movie portrayed each Character. Usually in movies you see alot of King Arthur and Lancelot, but none of the other Knights, but in this movie you see the lives of the other Knights as well, and the friendship they have formed and the brother-like qualities they all share. And Lancelot isn't portrayed as King Arthur's right-hand man, but his best friend. Though Guinevere came off a bit of a hoe-bag...to me atleast. I don't care what the critics said I loved the movie. Mainly because I'm a nerd and love history, but still, it was a great movie. I encourage all of you to see it. I'll see it again, and I know I'll buy it when it comes out...Great movie.

      so much crap is going one right now. i hate it! i don't know how long i can stay strong through all of this. i want to cry but no tears ever come. my world is spinning out of control. i don't know what to do. i am so emotionally drained. i feel like right now if anything else were to happen, event he most terrible thing you can think up, it wouldn't phase me. it's just be another thing i'd need to carry around with me. but i'll be fine, i know that. i know God has it under control. and that in it's self, gives me a peace inside.

      Wow, so I'm just now realizing that all my friends are leaving for college...I'm really sad. I hate being only a Junior in highschool. Everyone is leaving. Well okay not everyone, only about 6 people are leaving to go to college,  and then my brother and and some other people are leaving to go back to college. But still it's seems like everyone. So many emotions I have gone through and have yet to go through. I hate it. I always think it would be easier if i too were moving forward with my life. i hate the fact that i still have 2 years left of highschool. It's all good though, I am reallt excited for this school year, I'm 'taking the bull by the horns' and going full force, i'm going to make my last two years in highschool meaningful....sad, my friends are leaving...I'm happy for them though, I'm glad they all have plans for their lives and are pursuing their dreams. And besides there is always e-mail and the phone right?
