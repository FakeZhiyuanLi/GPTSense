						   King Edward VII introduced the custom of setting the 180 or so clocks on the Sandringham Estate half an hour early to allow him more time to shoot. As a consequence, all business when the King was at Sandringham took place in this unique royal time zone. George V maintained this tradition, but Edward VIII, when he acceded to the throne in 1936, reset Sandringham's time pieces in synchronicity with the rest of his kingdom.

						   I got down to thinking, its such a waste to spend six dollars on a grande size mocha frap at starbucks! Its an absolute rip off! So anyway, here is a recipe for one.  Take a blender, add in  -2 heaped tablespoons full of milo -1 heaped table spoon of cadbury hot chocolate powder -1/2 tablespoon Boncafe Mocca Coffee powder -1 near full cup of hl milk or any full cream or skim milk, your preference. -1/2 tablespoon condense milk (you can adjust as you try) -12-14 cubes of ice (Remember to wash the ice cubes first to remove any fishy, meaty smell that the ice takes on from storage in your fridge)  Blend until smooth, taste, and adjust taste as required.  Enjoy this simple drink! ^^ Adieu!

						   1) Unlike guys, they dont always talk about cars or soccer or trade ns stories! I mean... who on earth cares about cars if you cant afford them!!! Or soccer if you are not playing, unless of course you are betting heavily, then thats a different story.... And ns stories.....What in blue blazez!?!?!??!  2) Girls are definitely much nicer people to be with, ok...maybe thats a generalisation... on the same level of niceness (if there even is such a word) girls are much nicer. Why? Because they are able to pick up small signs of how you are feeling and will most probably know the right thing to say next. Of course it comes from them being hard wired as mothers but hey...just like testosterone for guys, its an advantage.  3) Girls can see effectively 180 degrees, well at least some. Definitely more than guys who only have tunnel vision. This is once again due to the fact that girls are nest defenders and thus have more visual cones in their eyes. But its still so cool! Thats why guys get caught all the time when they are ogling (did i spell that right?) at girls!  4) Girls arent always so (mind my crude term) horny as guys are! You know it gets Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo irritating when you are talking to a guy and all he is doing is looking in the other direction because of a pretty girl or something. Even if hes looking at you, he will go like :Uh huh.... Then try to steal a glance at the girl. Grrrrr......  5) Girls are so much better at humanities than guys, they can appreciate good songs and poetry. Rare is the man who can finish this poem that begins with : Whats in a name ^^

						   1) Guys are usually more of the sporty type, you want a game of rugby, tennis? No problem, of course its due to the testosterone and all but hey.... Its still an advantage.  2) Guys dont always talk about shopping or the latest mascara and definitely dont gossip as much ^_^  3) Guys do not whine or cry as much, not that crying is a bad thing but going on and on about something and living in the past is one of the girl trademarks.  4) Guys use current evidence to argue and never bring up personal attacks unlike girls who bring up that you are stupid or gay or what you did last week that has absolutely nothing to do with the argument at hand and they always find a way to bring up something personal.  5) Guys, unlike girls, are able to appreciate lame jokes. For some reason or other, either girls are slow or they have no sense of a warped humour whatsoever.

						   Ambrose Bierce (1842-c.1914) was a remarkable man: a veteran of the American Civil War, a writer, poet, journalist, and most memorably, the creator of the The Demon's Dictionary. For an audience: enlightened souls who prefer dry wine to sweet, sense to sentiment, wit to humour, and clean English to slang. Here are some of the more pungent entries:  Achievement: The death of endeavour and the birth of disgust.  Actually: Perhaps; possibly.  Adore: To venerate expectantly.  Auctioneer: A man who proclaims with a hammer that he has picked a pocket with his tongue.  Bore: A person who talks when you wish him to listen.  Court fool: The plaintiff  Coward: One who in a perilous emergency thinks with his legs.  Dentist: A prestidigitator who putting metal into your mouth, pulls coins out of your pocket.  Envelope: The coffin of a document; the scabbard of a bill; the husk of remittance; the bedgown of a love-letter.  Erudition: Dust shaken out of a book into an empty skull.  Forefinger: The finger commonly used in pointing out two malefactors.  Ghost: The outward and visible sign of an inward fear.  Hope: Desire and expectation rolled into one.  Hospitality: The virtue which induces us to feed and lodge certain persons who are not in need of food and lodging.  Influence: In politics, a visionary  quo  given in exchange for a substantial  quid .  Insurrection: An unsuccessful revolution. Disaffection's failure to substitute misrule for bad government.  Language: The music with which we charm the serpents guarding another's treasure.  Mausoleum: The final and funniest folly of the rich.  Painting: The art of protecting flat surfaces from the weather and exposing them to the critic.  Pray: To ask that the laws of the universe be annulled in behalf of a single petitioner confessedly unworthy.  Price: Value, plus a reasonable sum for the wear and tear of conscience in demanding it.  Riot: A popular entertainment given to the military by innocent bystanders.  Twice: Once too often.  Zeal: A certain nervous disorder afflicting the young and inexperienced.

						   Hai... i just dont know what to do..... Today my class had a discussion on whether torture was ever justifiable... I had a very very long presentation....around 3 full pages of transparencies compard to the others half. Ahahaha..... I was trying to introduce to them the debating technique of using definitions to aid your stand, i used how justified can be defined, case studies and all......  The teacher was so interested...the students... well... some of my friends were paying close attention but the rest were just vegetating away.... And they still had the audacity to say "So why arent you answering the question" and "Your point is?" Omg..... I was giving them the answer on a silver platter yet none could see it.... Stoopid girl and guy...i shant name... Its Junior college! Its called tertiary education! When will they stop expecting to be spoon fed! Not only did i give them a full argument, i gave them the generic backing for other similar topics.... Oh well....  Must as well gripe about society since i am in the mood... you know...i am still waiting for a girl to come up to me, i mean as friends, curtsy, eat with some dignity...or even a guy who has proper table manners. Its absolutely horrible! I am placing bets that few know what it means to eat American style or British style.... your economic standing is no excuse for this form of ignorance, i mean...i am only in a middle class family.... Even if i do not ask so much...when will i see someone who eats without his arms so spread out, or without noise when drinking soup or cutting meat..... Singapore....My home.....We just need to learn a bit more about culture....Hypocracy? Do i hear sour grapes? Its called having some decency.

						   Ok....heres a simple marinade for barbecue. Make sure you leave the chicken to stand for 2 hours or so.  For a more mediter. flavour: -olive oil -garlic (around 1 whole clove) -chopped fresh herbs (oregano, thyme...etc, if you are unsure of the kinds of herbs, use the italian herb mix available at any store) -salt and pepper to taste.  For a more spicy flavour: -olive oil -garlic (around 1 whole clove) -chopped rosemary -ground chilli (as much as you want) -salt and pepper to taste.  Or you could use the chilli and take out the seeds for a tinge of chilli flavour instead of full spice.  Remember for more flavour, strew the coals (when they are all grey or glowing) with woody herbs such as rosemary sprigs or fennel stems.  Adieu!

						   I am just sitting in my room, listening to Kim Lian's "Big girl" Cd track...(Aint she just the right mix of sweetness and punk? *sigh*) For some reason or other i feel so hopeless, sure...I do blame it on my feminine side but since its a part of me...what can I do.... I just feel like i need someone right now... But i have noone to turn to because i have little friends, actually less than a handful whom I actually call friends (Yeah...this comes from being wierd)  I need someone to hug....but there is just my little cosy green room.... so i have no choice but to cuddle my little teddy (Whose name is Celi by the way ^^) The softness does offer some temporary respite....but its cold. Unfeeling. Cold.  But this is the way life is.... and how it will be for some time to come. I just wish my feminine side would stop surfacing.... it feels....wierd. But i do relish that emotion from time to time.  Looking forward to an afternoon of work, project work and mugging for physics. Allow me to make myself a baileys. Suddenly....it seems much brighter! It fades. I need noone. I have myself and my God ^^  Adieu!

						   A favourite Italian dessert which is found in many regions. Here it is flavoured with coffee and Amaretto, but you could also use Marsala and Maraschino.  Serves 4-6  -20-24 sponge fingers, about 150g -2 tbsp cold black coffee -2 tbsp coffee flavouring (extract) -2 tbsp Amaretto or brandy -4 egg yolks -90 g caster sugar -few drops vanilla flavouring (extract) -grated rind of 1/2 lemon -350 g Mascarpone cheese -2 tsp lemon juice -250 ml double (heavy) cream -1 tbsp milk -30 g flaked (slivered) almonds, lightly toasted -2 tbsp cpcpa powder -1 tbsp icing sugar   1)Arrange almost half of the sponge fingers in the base of a glass bowl or serving dish. Combine the black coffee, coffee flavouring and Amaretto or brandy and sprinkle over half the mixture over the fingers.  2)Put the egg yolks into a heatproof bowl with the sugar, vanilla flavouring and lemon rind. Stand over a saucepan of gently simmering water and whisk until very thick and creamy and the whisk leaves a very heavy trail when lifted from the bowl.  3)Put the Mascarpone into a bowl, add the lemon juice and beat until the mixture is smooth.  4)Combine the egg mixture and Mascarpone mixture until evenly blended, then pour half over the sponge fingers and spread out evenly.  5)Add another layer of sponge fingers, sprinkle with the remaining coffee mixture and then cover with the remaining cheese mixture. Chill for at least 2 hours and preferably overnight.  6)To serve, whip the cream and milk together until  fairly stiff and spread or pipe over the dessert. Sprinkle with the flaked almonds and then sift an even layer of cocoa powder over so the top is completely covered. Finally sift a very light layer of icing suger over the cocoa powder.  Salute! Buon appetito!
