      Hello again everyone for another daily installment of bald's blog an a general idea of what he did today, which happens to be quite a lot. yes today I've leased a big update on the world of angst site which if you still haven't seen is at   angelfire.com/vamp/woa    I've added a chat server which if I'm on my computer I will be on if I can get on it also a forum is now ours which I hope sees more use than a few other forums I know of and you can use it as a guestbook to. Go on have a look don't be shy. another couple  of things I've done include wrighting a short bio which is on there  added a thanks page to everyone who helped even passively  also I've added a link to my friends site and lastly a link to a weird guy doing random stuff, he's got to off had a strange up-bringing...  something that's not quite working yet is a quoter I've got for the bottom bar which I would still be doing if it weren't so damm annoying oh well I'll work it out later.  thirdly and finally for now happy holidaying  Ben  should we all be so lucky to go on holiday ahoy, the ship off fortune blows your way may it continue while you there and some time after, just so long as you let me on anyway.  well that's it for now see you again on the home cooking channel where we'll be making bread... I mean see you again viewer and watch this hilarious cut from an American shopping channel  LOL take that TV presenter  may take a while to load but I find it hilarious

      Yea today the worlds treated me pretty well im not to sure why. I guess its gone by left me Today the most unpredicted item was getting my bro in a large ammout of trouble for going round with someone he's not supposed to which was pretty hilarious. Other than that today has reminded me of my feeling of separation from the rest of the world I've tried to look into the waters of life and get back in but it's just not me I feel my place is on the sidelines but I know not why also. I've wrote a short biography's to go on the world of angst site but it's another thing which has reminded me of my seemed separation from life and how little of any value I have achieved and how few memory's I have of times past. All in all I've worked myself into quite a deep depression again and I don't think I can e arsed to do any thing tonight. (sigh) the times off fun an innocence seem so long ago I even wonder if they even happened and I look at my life and wonder if it was even worth living for. incase anyone gets worried at this point that I might be contemplating suicide you need not worry for in my oppinion its another one of those whats the point things along with my life which I suppose leaves me in a pointless stupor with nothing to aim for but the fact that something I enjoy doing might come up evenly though I still very much doubt it will. Well sorry if it been a depressing read so far but im just feeling very down at the moment and can't be bothered anymore well if any off or all of this made any sense I will be supprised as I dunno what im talking about really just a long ramble which gets a little off my mind while im wrighing, if I brighten up later I might think of relooking at this an perhaps wrighting a second blog but for the moment a pounding headache is developing so im going to bed.  maybe some other time my readers yours in a pit of woes Bald

But anyway yea this afternoons been pretty great got to play my music about twice as loud as normal at which point my mum would probable of turned it off for me, but not today. So if I cant hear tomorrow you'll know why. Talking of tomorrow WOOT it will be my birthday finally its about time and ill be gaining my mp3 player and some other stuff. yes I'm  actually quite unagrieved this afternoon and I'm gonna find some games later I've been playing AOE most of the afternoon and I'll be going out later so come to think of it you might be lacking a game again oh dear to you.

      Yea my internet been down all afternoon isn't that great I wish that happened everyday, NOT stupid NTL why do you have to go wrong so often but yea German speaking test is over and I think I've done reasonably well although this is only really due to it being mostly multiple choice questions so I could have done really bad and not know it but at least its over with  I can't be bothered to do anything at the moment it taken me about 15 minutes just to right this much, I can remember what I did while my internet was down so I was probably unconscious but this morning I did manage to sort out the java script on the new menus and I now know more or less what I'm doing I just need to think of some things to put in the menus and being as though the side bar is almost empty if anyone wants to jump on and add there own section ill contact me -Baldy_III@hotmail.com- and ill think about it I'm not guaranteeing anything, I might not like you enough but still I'm on a moral high but not to a point I'd call happiness just emptiness a few other great things about today include  seeing some guys I've not seen since primary school metalica they're great the knowlage that its now only 2 days until my birthday, Yea  finding some pois on iwantoneofthose on my first visit in a long time confused here you go  flame pois  if you don't trust yourself with fire  Cobra pois  not got any games yet because quite frankly I cant be bothered and I've given up with legends for the moment but once the sites up(which wont be long hopefully) they'll be plenty on there well see you people tomorrow or perhaps later today I feel I didn't right all I could have today

      Yea IM finally back after a good long clearing walk and rest in the shade of the trees as I right this I'm eating my dinner so I cant do much about legend yet but if you read this before any link appear underneath have a complain at me on MSN messenger if you have it Baldy_III@hotmail.com  well after a bit of the old searching I've come up with the old nothing I think my spree of finding interesting site is over as all I can find now is of site saying do vampires exist and someone else saying oh yes I'm one you'll believe me even though I have no idea what I'm talking about and just want to sound cool, well to those people I say you bloody twat it make you sound like a complete idiot or is the just because you can't hide you true nature and you really are an idiot. Sorry but this kind of person just makes me angry what the point in tying to force other people to believe you surely if the do exist they would stay out of the way of society because they'll just be Burt or whatever take witches in medieval Europe if you get accused of beings a which your dead the same would happen with any other group of people such a vamps and lycans. sorry for my anger but I'm furious at these people but its really an idle fury

      Well today's been once again a boring day and I'm back to normal I think infact today's been so boring I have absolulty nothing to right about apart from how just before I wrote this I played a game of Age of Empires with Akers whom was beating me Thoroughly  as I only had a small band of cavalry and made the game last so long he had to go and I won by default (yea bless you whoever invented default).  Also I managed to do some of the new web site and we have a couple of drop down menus and I just need to fill them and add a quote generator to the bottom and the time and the shell is done to be filled with thought.  Thirdly I did some revision (wow exciting I know) and discovered some odd ways of obtaining water if your in a nasty waterless situation.  song line(s) of the day "stand and deliver, or the devil he may take ye." Metalica,whisky in the jar  as this then preceded to remind me of "stand and deliver, your lupins or your life" "but we don't have any lupins" "don't give me that this is the lupin express" or something to that effect originally by Monty Python after a quick search i found   the words to this sketch  -- Thank Age of Empires for the lack of a game or legends stuff I'll make it up tomorrow I promise.

      Well its the day after and I've spent most of the day up to now either sleeping or out in the wood on the hill. ah the shaded thoughts away from civilization and the revelation it brings, such as: what a useless race off beings humans are as a whole and what the hell is the use of emotion, well I'm almost back to  my normal state after more of less 3 hours of what I suppose is pretty close to meditation I just go off on mind journeys more often and the what ifs start to appear though I know things can't be changed now, stupid conscience.  also a large dose of hand in nettles is quite helpful in my thinking, ouch the excruciating pain. well I probably sit down to another boring day of witch I'm sure the fequency is about to multiply, at least school gave me something to do and get annoyed at. well i've already found some suff on werewolfs today its quite alot actualy  all kinds of crazy crap  well now i intend to sit down and do some revision (dun dun dun shock horror) then later ill do something for the woa site for now my song line of the day is  Need the one you love and love the ones you need, SoaD - Mind and heres your game after a days of neglect i think you deserve 2  a blast   alein shooter(download)

      Firstly, WOO YEA WEST PARK SCHOOLING IS FINALLY OVER! here are the tears after the final assembly which I was actually quite disappointed by ,you'd think the school could have put at least a bit more effort into it couple more useless awards and shit. A few people were at least saddened by leaving but not  me. But I guess this is a good point for me to put in to anyone from west park who reads this that I will miss you all even though I'm just a guy who trys to go unnoticed and you might not have talked to me much ,if at all, I know who I will miss (its a surprisingly long list) but good luck to you all and hope to see you again, just don't get masses of surgery so I wont recognize you.  after the assembly a quick journey home to change and pack and off again to our little party with some of you wonderful people though some people I've gone away with a less than respectable image no names if the read they know who they are. I don't know some people and alcohol just don't mix especially in company. I've got to try and remember the funny parts of it though such as giggles wussing out of the alcohol moving everyone after a rozzer scare tinly getting knocked over by a space hopper and provably a few other things.  but I'm now back home and It feels quite strange not Because I'm drunk but there's something not quite right probably  to do with leaving school but its not really sank in yet I mean I'm still gonna see everyone when I go in for my exams. its probably pent up emotion; sorrow from leaving, joy from the party, anger at some peoples behavior (a more extensive list than the people who don't mix with alcohol) and regret that I didn't get to know you all as well as I might have liked, my own fault really but I am who I am now I know who I know. i can definitly say thought that i dont want to feel how i do now again.   the years at west park have been great,  thanks go to all the people who came to the party Jess, Sophie, Lyndsey, Ben, Joe T, Joe M, Adam, Wigsey, Josie, Amber, Simon, Giggles, Mark, Paul, Big al, Rach, David, Laura (yoink) and all the people who have befriended me over the last five years and although I will probably see quite a few of you again at collage there will be a part of you gone and it will be missed and to the people I won't see again, once again I say I'll miss you and good luck in whatever you end up doing.  and as Ben also says we gotta have another go at what we did today it was great and I do hope to see you all again I only hope some people have learnt a lesson from this first attempt.  no game or legends stuff i don't feel like learning anything else today

      "Things have never been so swell" I have never felt this well woot compulsory schooling is finally over just a final no lessons day and a couple of exams  then no  more school expect party and fires to break out. Well in my opinion good riddance to bad rubbish it could burn down if there won't such great individuals hidden amongst the masses of preps. unfortunately I choose the probably regrettable decision to go to collage but I couldn't be bothered to find a job and it would probably be a waste of the ability I otherwise can't be bothered to use. Today also saw an attempt to re-collect the ancient Frisbee (comparable to the holy grail of memory's of our last year) but it proved difficult as it would probably not be looked down upon approvingly by the king and then we were forced to withdraw by the threat from sambob's veritable army  well all in all today was a pretty good day did no work whatsoever except IT curse you Mr Fern. Luke seems to have gone mad and samby(e) got mad in like the last 20 mins of our last lesson, I mean WTF!  also unfortunatly i was  wailaid by enermys and was unable to surch for any stuff  on lycan history so tommorow ill have t try again but somthing tells me i might not be in the state to do anything (interprate as you will but it has somthing to do with party) what i did discover however is that you can eat nettles so long as there young and you boil them for about six minites first and yes you can also eat reeds you know the sort that grows round ponds and stuff well the root anyway if you boil them and thirdly pine needly boiled in water makes a nutritus drink(all this and more dicovered in the SAS living of the land hand book)  well we've finaly decided on a name for our site world of angst and constuction will begin almost as soon as i've finished this blog, well any odd person who reads this from school hope to see youat our do tommorow(i begin to worry you know)  well heres a game   you win by dying that cant be right  (coming soon) -------------------------------------------  OPEN YOUR EYES, OPEN YOUR MOUTHS, CLOSE YOUR HANDS AND MAKE A FIST

      Good evening and welcome to another installment of bald's blog today's subjects are I skived PE where as my piers failed after being rated out by one or two unmentionable people curse there names that they may die to the beatings of a thousand trolls. But I escaped from this as the PE zombies fail to apply the simple rule of keeping an eye on potential truants instead of letting them slip off when there back is turned.  also today yielded quite a lot in the vampire legend research so ill put up a few (can't be bothered to do all of the sites) that I found today review to you own tastes if you interested in this kind of thing  Vampire vault   check out the  history bit   and here's another interesting article on  vampires  being as though today was entirely covering vampires I must make up for this tomorrow with a day on werewolves  and if threes anything else you recommend I look into mail me @ Baldy_III@hotmail.com in minor news today I discovered the meaning of the word Loam - a rich soil of clay, sand and decayed vegetable matter mmm sounds tasty today has been quite productive I must say as also I have begun a new site on stuff stuff and teenage crap with fellow school guy Ben who you may find at  http://angstriddenyouth.blogspot.com/  well after an unnecessarily long blog here's is two games (the first not really a game but oh well   Spirograph with a difference     may need downloading and only a trial but its good while it lasts  ----------------------- if u choked a smurf...What color would he turn?

      Well today I have done nothing on the vampire Lycan front but have been side tracked looking at a Kurt Cobain conspiracy theory site  which you can see here  also a game of Age of Empires which then crashed making it a small waste also took me of my intended target. also a brief dip into the Illuminati was to be held accountable the school day went by without much merit apart from being left in the dark about the leavers assembly.  unfortunate I do believe my hay fevers flaring up again which ain't to good if I have to make 4 trips to and from school, now that's gotta be bad for my health (aswell as my sanity though I don't have as much of that to lose). one thing I was not sidetracked from is finding you lucky people (who i'm still convinced don't exist but this takes away some of the boredom time) a game. So here you go have fun with a game  plucked staight from half-life .

      Today has once again been quite predictably boring. I guess really I should be worrying and revising for my GCSE's but I’m not can't be bothered, I mean I only go to school for some mild amusement for a while otherwise I’d just stay away. Anyhow after my recent viewing of Van Helsing, and not long before I saw underworld on DVD, I’ve decided to have a bit of a poke into the legends surrounding Vampirism and lycanthropsy (werewolves) so far as I’ve only been at it since about 6 I’ve come up with quite a decent werewolf site if your interested   urlLink lycan wood    Though u’ll have to read between the lines a bit. Also it seams to be a bit more difficult to find a sensible site on vampires that gives un-opinionated facts so I’ll keep looking well for anyone who reads simply for the game here it is  urlLink shoot things in a car

      I have finally returned for my perilous journey to the UCI and I believe I have come out better off (not financially of course… grumbles about price of bus fare and cinema tickets). Van Helsing was definitely a worthwhile film though not really from a originality perspective definily had flash backs from a few other films, but I suppose that’s probably to be expected from any film. I will give it a  ****  *  this film will be collecting dust in a DVD case on my shelf in the near future. Apart from this and being hit on the head several times the day has gone by rather uneventfully. Played manhunt again killed people in rather mean and nasty ways Get wasted by lag on a number of MMORPGs found a good site for these if you like them can find out when there in open beta stage and download it for free though there not perfect at least the free anyway heres the site for that   urlLink here's the games of the past present and future  and as i have no more to add heres your game  urlLink smack the pingu   ----------------------------- The world is your oyster but you can bet there’s no pearl

      Hello the few to zero people who read these well I decided that if nobody reads these things Which being though I know that should prove to Ben that at least 1 person does I might as well wright my own in order to pass away the time as I am now so constantly bored. And like bens blog I will also strive to shove a game in here which may attract some visitors even if they don't read it(being on the forum at this time don't help either) the item of the day is 'goldfish' as created in a stupid conversation with  Kut Armz 4 Steady Healing, Slit Wrists 4 Instant Relief @ hotmail right now it is 10 of the clock and i cant be bothered to find my own game so ill steal my fav of bens so far  urlLink Make Like Robin Hood and Brain People With A Longbow!  although I personally like arrowing people in the groin well ima off and always remember I can find you in the blink of an enormous eye ------------------------------ not sponsored by system of a down tho there songs are great ------------------------------ if atoms are so good how come there dead

         Hello thar mayteys today thar be pirates on the deck As there be a half day at bill to contend with. Pretty good place but i must say it kind of dragged on a bit and it seams i spent a lot longer than one afternoon there. First memorable part was the explosions created in chemistry witch i intend to one day in the near future recreate, the hardest part about it will be the potassium permanganate (or how ever you spell it) the other parts ethanol and either hydrogen or sodium peroxide ill try both if i get it wrong first time,the other interesting part of the day also included errm... Nothing else of any interest. So there is a general overview of may day, tomorrow includes computing witch might be interesting, if we get on the computers, but i doubt it will happen and physics might be interesting depending on what they decide to teach. this is bald and you've been reading the 20 to 6 blog good day

         yea today I've avoided all form of work more or less except having to go get my brother from school, so I've had a lot of spare time with which i have probably used to some good, firstly though i will speak, or type, in more detail about the last few days as the blogs have been sadly lacking in there appearance first thing i can remember is the half-dream which took me to a church through the graveyard, i went there in real life later to find out all the graves were in the same place as in the dream, as i stepped inside i awoke with a feeling like when you touch a TV that has recently been turned off after being on a long time, inside my head which was so strange i had to write it down. anyhow that was Friday night and during that day i had been side tracked being called to assist in preparations for a party, I'm sure i probably could have done a blog that day but i didn't feel much up to it. Saturday i had intended to write my blog in the morning before i went up to yonder party  but work and play didn't mix and the window was closed and i was pulled away to something i guess i mildly enjoyed but also mildly depressed me as well, annoying little kids. Today, although having to do a bit of work it has been mostly free and i didn't have to get up until about half twelve, I've otherwise used the day brushing up on my poor flash skill so i can have another go at that reading through what I've so far done in VB to get it in my head and in-between I've been playing RYL, Unreal and with my new device  (one of these) . All in all has been an mildly interesting day especially confusing children wondering where the music was coming from. And now i intend to sit back and blow some little fools away on UT so vaarwel(/Dutch, i think)

         well firstly an apology for the last 2 days I've been very busy with all sorts of stuff and haven't had chance to blog. Some of these things include destoying my house, giving a hand in a party preparation, destoying my house some more, going to a party, destroying my house and in the spare time I have playing unreal tournament to hold back the pain of my aching muscles, I'm writing this in my "lunch break"  after just taking down the polysyrine tiles of the ceiling, just so you know I haven't forgotten about you and I'll write when I get a good chance to. Anyway I'm going to use the small part of the break I have left to play unreal and when and if I get chance later to write all I want to I will. So until next time my friends P.S that could be a long time.

         Now on to today after just posting for yesterday. today I woke with the thought of damm I wish my eyes would stop stinging for yes they did and oddly still do hurt after the battering they took yesterday from pollen. Once I'd finally got up I had to finish tidying my room for a guy was later to come round to value our house. This task was one that took up quite some time but I was glad in the knowladge that I can play a good ole round of the chaos ut mood witch included some great new and old weapons such as the trusty old crossbow, the return of the ripper under the new guise of the C.U.T.T.E.R a one of many great new additions a rail gun with the ability to shoot straight through the level ignoring walls the mod also brought with it a mode of play called vehicle CTF with as you might guess is capture the flag with vehicles well I must indeed say that today has had a lot less a verity of things to do than yesterday and there's also that I don't feel I can write to much more after my last blog I will have to say adios amegos signed Bald, that guy who just wont leave in a hurry ---- Ps to anyone with UT2004 I do as always highly recommend getting the chaos mod it has as always injected a whole new level to the unreal series, keep e'm coming(both unreal and the chaos modificaions)

         I'm most humbly apologies Mr blogger dashboard ,oh and anyone who wanted to read this yesterday for yesterday my internet broke in a fashion I couldn't be arsed to fix right before the time I wanted to blog. Currently my internet is fixed, woop, and so I will now write something along the lines I should have wrote yesterday, 00:00 still on my computer from the previous day playing red orchestra, which has failed to connect to any internet game yet but great fun playing a Russian soldier in WWII the game is good but the lack of being able to get on the net with mine really sucks. So practice mode rather disappointing in difficult and bots, your team will just stand round the spawn point and do nothing I can't even order them to move, there team will wander round in a big group meaning you can slaughter them all with a burst of accurate machine gun, not particularly challenging the only thing which makes it difficult is the lack of an aiming thingy-m-watsit, so all in all not very pleased with that mod, at least till I can get online. 02:00  finally went to bed. morning woke up to think oh yes I've got the bonus pack I downloaded to look at today and so that is what I did.  the bonus pack contains some of the most interesting levels I have seen and am considering getting the other pack, my favorite so far has been ONS-valarna which puts your at crash sites opposite each other in a lush valley in the heart of nali country heath packs are replaced and the environments just so cool. Anyhow enough of this rant which only UT players will probably understand and to the afternoon where I was fotunalty saved from the terrors of tiding my room by a knock at the door an the unexpected arrival of Ben, Mark and Adam and the spontaneous journey to hermits cave which I probably shouldn't have taken as it effected my hay fever, and my thirst quite to a negative effect. The at the journeys end I was to discover that unfortunately I had lost my mp3 player ,shock horror, fortuasly after then traipsing back half the distance back. I found it where I had accidentally tripped over in a field of broad beans. By the time I'd got back from that I had lost the ability to connect to the internet so I played some of the chaos ut2 mod I downloaded before being pushed back into tidying my room followed by going to bed. that's it I now start blog 2, Blogger - keep away

         I'm bored, so I'm going to write a blog. Today as usual has been slow going but I have something to look forward to unfortunately its also a curse of the day, one days curse is another days blessing in this case, the reason for this has been 2 downloads for UT2004 one bonus pack and one red orchestra are making there slow way onto my PC, this annoyingly means I can do anything on the net without slowing it down(I shouldn't be writing this but I'm so bored). I've even done some work I've been so bored (whoa Bald did work!). apart from waiting I saw some text like this "ma best m8" and "suma ma m8s" and things such as nown, dnt, uva, we'v which I have also come to realize I hate I mean does it really save much if any time, the best example there is "ma" meaning my what's the point in replacing y with a from the key m its at least twice as far away not that it should matter but if you to lazy to type properly with both hands then why make it so you have to go twice as far to reach a key. This has once again lead me to think about |_337 speak and a once thought notion that eventually everybody will shorten words down but now I realize that wouldn't happen because it would annoy the fuck out of quite a lot of people I know. I can understand it in a first person shooter(fps) where is your going to get killed if you stand round to long but a message board or chat room is not going to kill you if you don't finish you sentence fast enough.   anyhow this has turned out quite a lot longer than I originally guess but oh well the more the merrier I'll see you all again tomorrow then, if we haven't all died that is, or you choose  never to read this page again.

         todday has been a day of many films,as we have anumber of rented DVD's in my home at the momentt i decided to spend this day watching them so it is not that i have seen little today it is that it's verry difficult to write about films you've watched , i wright this during a break between die another day which i just finished wayching and somthing else which i haven't decided on yet, well this is all i can muster at the moment so i guess this page will next change tommorow.  goodbye my readers, i know this blog was rather lame but i can't think of anything to write

         Well I just watched bullet proof monk so I have a kind of monk philosophy in my head, it was a decent film but a bit crap at the same time in a way I can't be bothered to explain right now and I wont remember about it tomorrow. As some of you may have seen, though I doubt it, I released my update for  WoA  I spent the last 3 days on this ignoring almost everything else but I enjoyed writing it even if you don't enjoy browsing it. I guess I relay like to write it more that I like to view it really, cant wait till I can Wright my own JavaScript and the like and so writing my own games. Yes today been pretty boring as per usual the rain meant I couldn't really go out, I would of if I could of rain is so much better that a sunny day more depressing and lets you think more. Thinking today has gone not to well tiding my room and the years it took to upload today's update has kept me active with massively boring yet engrossing tasks so I've not had much time to spare. Now as today has little to Wright about I'm going to go about a little medative sitting in the evening, all though technically its night its to bright to call night.  once again after a boring post I say goodnight  for an interesting read I like Ben's post for today which can be found  urlLink here

         yea today you get the rare sight of one blog in tow days or perhaps that should be the other way round, anyhow that RS exam definitely put a downer on my spirits then it rained, great its fine weather until we leave the exam, obviously God is punishing me for doing so badly, but oh well I've got a website full of new stuff to get finishing there's that and that I'm indoors not that I'm particularly bothered by the rain,quite refreshing anyhow with a feeling of night descending with the rain clouds I'm begging to regain some of my sanity after wrighting about some group of people I frankly don't care about, I'm simply glad I don't have to ever touch that subject ever again WOOO. well time to copy some disks onto my PC for ERM eay access humm yes I'll call it that.  the exam did however give me time to think ,as they once again gave us more time than we needed or at least I found it that way, well unsurprisingly I did think about religion but in the sense of how it is a way of controling people. In this sense religion is one of the greatest designs ever. This also reminds me of an article I read once so ill use that first well faith what a great idea "God exists" "prove it" "no you have to have faith" you might as well say "1+1=3" "prove it" "you have to have faith" next blastphemy another great idea if anyone challenges what we say we can kill them for blastphemy (bit of an old concept now though) and lastly infidels which follows on from blastphemy, if we cant kill them then we'll brand them an infidel so no one will listen to what they say.  well that's a shortened version of that anyway but then there's all the rules they must  follow yes some are quite practical rules but then others witch aren't and are just stupid like what used to be give about 10% of your earnings to the church and then when this silver plate comes round you must then put even more ofyour money in it I fel I've ranted on long enough and I think quite incoherently to but lol that now whoever hates its problem not mine.  once again the sane bit of my insanity this parts where I say goodbye. oh yes and if you want to see something I leant in my spare time go to  urlLink http://trak.to/jenks  and visit the guest book you should see it immediatly

         Yea I dunno what it is about today but I'm feeling kind off up and happy this morning well if Ben's listening to kerrang I can bet he's happy Rasmus is on lol, anyhow what's with saying I like them I only said 'at least on person will listen to it' when my mum got the album for on song , I don't think however this means I like them I mean WTF I don't care to much if they're on anyhow oh well ill put that behind me well to continue my resticted blog yesterday yea creating website one thing that does make me quite happy its fun and one day I hope to have some "real content to put into one" perhaps a company one.  The new updates coming along well and does contain many song buchered into midi style though I have thought of something to do  *goes quite suddenly* well yes also has a few of applets and stuff and a new way of moving the menus as well as a few bits of renaming and messing around with links yes well that's that being as though I've only really just woke up properly I've not done much yet but I also intend to learn some more visual basic today. And hmm the last thing I wrote about yesterday errmm.. Oh yes the music well had little of that except kerrang radio with is now playing good charlotte ARGGHHH *turns the volume right down*  well on with the stage prefomance today well I'm informed the England football team actual won something woob but I don't care (I know technically that was yesterday but I only just found out) and I now think about the large impending RS exam this afternoon DAMMIT WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO LONG !! Well I hope everyone who wants to do well in it(probably no-one) does well and I'm sure you will especially in comparison to me I'm gonna fail so badly oh well nevermind so looking at the time you can defiantly expect another blog today, oh yes and check The  urlLink WOA forum  as there's a little notice there

         YEY a free day well spent i think, this blog ain't gonna be to be painfully restricted as i have a lot more to wright than i can be bothered to part 1 i've started learning Visual basic but have had alot of other things to do so i've got as far as leaning how to use the wizzards (not verry far in other words) but it looks to be quite intresting i think i need to go out and come back to it again later as i get bored of reading tecnical books after a short while as im sure everyone else does. also today has heralded the start of a new update for  WoA  which, though i pretend i only care about people veiwing it i realy do it because i like to be able to wright somthing that appers visualy and it's just somthing i find intresting. well thirdly music been a big lot of stuff happened today firstly downloaded a whole lot of extra music. And then listened to it getting forcefull shoved into the mold that is the midi file and watch it loose almost every good aspect about it, i takes a true mirical if a good song is not ruined by midi. well anyhow that beeing the fastest blog and most shortened ever blog i have written when i could be writing loads. i being torn away from my computer shall have to say adue, goodbye my good people

          YEA another song lyric for a title during the meanwhilest How ya'll doing, hope you are all doing well and planning a toughly worthwhile day tomorrow as there are no exams at all wooo. I personally think that a good choice would be to pray to your God/Gods that they come down and prove he/she/they is/are the one/ many true God/Gods and ignite all the Judaism papers in a burst of holy rage and then go back to the heavens/hells/dimentions/where ever they came from perhaps to smite Mr Payne on the way. yes well back to today. I've been looking round my new visual studio or rather Microsoft visual studio which I've acquired to learn something in. And secondly I've been looking round  middle-earth online.com  witch looks to be a good MMORPG set in, yep you guessed it middle-earth. so in conclusion today has been of little to no economic value and has once lead to me thinking what is the point of money most people spend there life trying to get it and then they die where by you lose it all again, what's the point in that also the saying money is the source of all evil if everyone knows this then why do we still have money. but oh well I am but one kid what can I do, *sighs* I'm so tied of this world and I've only been "aware" a couple of years, damm well the thought that someone might read this kind of cheers me up once again it is time for me to leave and you to once you reach here and I leave you with news that some guy is shouting things in the street and that difference which makes no difference, is no difference    as an add on to this i just found this on the net i expect you've seen it anyway though not realy for the girls everyone knows girls = time + money hey also know time is money thus girls = money + money then consider that money is the root of all evil so, girls = evil + evil girls = evil x2  just thought id add it to make it longer

        from where I see the ships afar  hmmm yes anyhow today's been like a tomato soup, excitingly boring I've had no exam yea but I've had to stay in all day housekeeping oh well, its definitely seemed like I've been living on my own since about 10 last night when almost everyone went to a tent warming party or rather they slept in the tent in the back garden, so I got all the house except the very top room all to myself, this was then followed up by waking up at about 10;30 this morning to soon enough find the house empty again, and it's been such until now and probably until later as well. well being on my own (despite the terror of it LOL) has given me a long time to think and strangely I've been thinking about the future which is odd because it goes agains my live for the day for tomorrow may not exist, way off life I've recently tryed to adopt, unfortunately money is a major set back oh well, however continuing I was thinking of what on earth I'm gonna do once I leave education anyhow I've been told I should be a doctor but I dunno that requires listening to other peoples problems, but my own idea was and has for a long time been programming so I've decided to did up some tutorials on a lot of languages including VB pearl and C along with java but that's not really a progamming lanuage anyhow I'm stuck I dunno which on I want to pick up first, if anyone who reads this knows anything about it I'd be grateful so any ideas Mail me or IM at Baldy_iii@hotmail.com, well once I've stared I probably wont be on messenger so much, to busy trying to get it to do what I want it to do, but I doubt anyone will miss me people seem to be afraid of talking to me or adding me ? Oh well any how after a long rather unlike me rant I'll be taking my coat and walking out into the internet, I'm told its raining.

        hello again everyone sorry about missing yesterday although it makes no difference when you read about what I’ve done anyway I think its something that I can even be bothered to write these when its just sowing up how I live to any random person who comes across it.  Well being as though I missed it ill start with yesterday well it heralded a Friday which means the end of the second week of the exams and most importantly the end of having a load of foreign words blown like a hurricane at me then being expected to learn them, well I can definitely say I’m glad that’s over with. Well in celebration of the occasion a few of us decided to disappear down gravel pit again. It went ok until some indescribable something’s came over a decided "oh wouldn't it make us look big to hit Ben" from which I noticed the promptly left as is there custom, many curses be upon there cowardly backs I hope they take there own lives or suffer some mortal wound, there would be few who missed them though it won't happen just because I say so, unworthily I am not one of the loom maidens. Anyhow after returning home I remember I was once again annoyed at myself for being so reclusive during the whole thing, well one day I’ll get it right, I hope.  Well today - got up about 11 got some food and sat down to Bram Stoker's Dracula, which we've had quite a while but I’ve never thought to watch it not to sure on the effects and stuff came across with a stronger story line than anything else witch I guess is part to do with my interest in the vampyre legend and part to do with that being a sign of a truly classic film witch I would expect no less from such a good book, well I’m reliably informed its a good book I’ve never read it myself. Well to the present, the days been topped off with a bought of downloads from slipknot to application challenges from hack this site, hex editors and guns'n'roses music so I’m generally pleased with the results of today infect I might go to bed to celebrate or that might be to do with a mass headache coming on.  Anyhow I’m informed that Ben cant blog it wont let him sign in so if he don't blog its because of that no doubt  well after a 'hard' (loud shout of "yeah right") days work I’m goanna lye down

         a tiring day after both English and geography exams both subjects which I hate, stupid fate. Although I am pleased with the fact that I managed to write a letter in both ending in yours faithfully- myself  well hope everyone did as well as they needed to if not better I certainty do its always that last thing that I cant do but need to so I really need to have done well in either electronics or English but I can be some people have done 100% better than me. But oh well there only exams. Home which reminds me of an article I read yesterday on how school doesn't actual teach you anything except how to conform to rules. I wouldn't exactly put it that far but I reckon that's more or less true.  well anyway I'll take this chance to record the fact that I have now suffered 6 nose bleeds in three days woot and to think I'd never had a nose bleed (a proper one at least) ever in my memory  well time for me to go back into the pit that is the world wide web with a pick axe and a brain and then I'll be going out from 5 so I don't have long anyway, god and fate know what time I'll be back if ever I might die of loosing all my blood, and perhaps all other bodily fluids before I get back  on a side note I read a forum where someone was talking about how they want to commit suicide so I decided I'd right this for myself  whets the point in suicide you die when you are destined to if your destined to kill yourself you'll just do it otherwise just keep on going and see what other crueltys fate has for you but you can probably say there will be a few good times in your life even if it is only caused by a slip of the loom, enjoy it while it lasts. Don't stain against your thread until it snaps. Well after a few things a wrote for myself but you can read and take note if you want it is once again time for my to close the font tag and leave this untill tommorow

         hello!   today I've taken to wrigting in html form after spending most of my spare time (which wasn't that long as a slept most of this morning) on hack this site but also taking to the political enthic side, pretty boring I know some people will think and would rather lean to hack but that's not the point, I'm looking for knowlage and there's a whole lot of people out there with it (just not many in comparison with those who don't) but any how I had fun started learning a world of new stuff cant say I'm any good at it yet though.  but here's the part most people wont read. politics I once remember mark saying we should get more into how our country's run not saying a now agree I just saying I think its run badly but at least I don't think tonys doing quite as bad a job as bush is in America  to which I have found links to loads of and there are none of the what good he's done leading to two possible conclusions either he's done non or its so little nobody cares to note it down  anyhow I can get back on hts now since I wrote this while it didn't let me on. So I might right a bit more later when I'm  stuck on a challenge or something well if any also uses HTS my names Eon if you get stuck on something I'll try and help  well till I write again goodbye

      well another days gone past and a major highlight of today has been two mass nose bleeds, while the blood is an itresting liquid its rather annoting when its streaning from your nose instead of someones neck. also today was the first full veiwing of the transit of venus across the sun whitnessed by mankind so though it may have been a pathetic black dot moving across the sun it was a once in a life time event and I'm slighty happyer that i've seen what some people can never see.  well with two nosebleeds, a mathes exam, a good roasting at the hands of the sun, an inability to focus properly and a ponding headache coming on I'm not feeling particly good tonight. but i've found my way back into hack this site which is a cool website which basicly gives the basics to the advanced on web hacking if your intrested its  urlLink hack-this-site dot org  aI'm quite happy with myself as im now twice as far as i got last time and i read loads of help articals then  well i dont feel like typing anything else tonight as my headaches getting realy bad but i hope anyone who reads this has a better evening than I'm going to and I'm sure you probably will  signing ooff one again its bald, goodnight people

      whoops i did forget to blog yesterday oh well i'm sure you can agree that the news that i did nothing is not of particlar intrest to you anyway but today i did find a full conversion mod for UT2K4(unreal tournament 2004 if your not into it) its called alien swarm and its a possitvly difficult thing to get used to. the mod changes the game to a top down view and throws you onto a planet swaming with an alien speices unoriginaly named the swarm, but who cares about the name you get to kill em, you basicaly get a team of 4 troops that are selectable befor you start the mission. You Then have to gide them through the map to do certain objectives and escape again.the mod also supports a co-op mode which is pretty good except when you team mate runs infront of ur gun and you don't get any extra guys so i don't know how it works if you have 5 players. a good mod which for me would be easyer if my mouse wheel worked and once you've grasped the basics your away. anyone with UT2K4 who likes the sound of this mod should visit  blackcatgames.com  for more info otherwise these past two days havn't brought much up done plenty of gaming but i can't realy report that here because it's boring to write about what u've done

      hello there. Well once again has been a rather uneventful day might just might get to see my uncle again later but I'm not sure about that other than that my only other highlights are receiving my letter from bill this morning telling me about the induction days and what group I'll be in, and my email from Ben at cyber cafe USA ,damm its not in the USA, oh well you beat me to something there I've not been to one of them yet so I'll just have to go one step better and go to a LAN party before you although if its a LAN party I'd probably invite as many of you as I could anyway BUT I would make sure I went in first... Under penalty of death, well maybe that's a bit to harsh but oh well. Anyway once again reporting on another further uneventful day its your friendly naibourhood bald signing off to sleep it off  oh well I might have a interesting dream I suppose though technically that will be tomorrow.  bu bye for now eveyone

         hello for the first time in 5 days, it has been busy in some parts and so dull in others so&nbsp;I haven't done a blog for a while but here one is I hope I can remember everything that's happened recently.  22nd and 23rd contained I think just about nothing at&nbsp; all, at least nothing of any interest that I can remember anymore  24th a what seem to be going to be an average day(i.e really boring) turned out quite interesting as about five past twelve Ben tells me to come round if I want to come with him to his dads allotment, we'll me taking up any challenge to stop being bored I accept and check my mp3 and sound bug are working only to Discover my sound bug has ran out of battery so off I go to the post office burdened with money and a deposit my mum asked me to put on her card, when I get back and I ready I leave 10 minutes before I'm supposed to be there half way up the hill 'dammit I left my computer on, I can't trust my family round my PC when I'm not at the helm, back home a few mouse clicks later I'm off again&nbsp; with only five minutes left before I'm supposed to be there, hurry hurry a bit of running later I&nbsp;get there at god knows what time and we leave immediately with&nbsp;the addition of Adam,&nbsp;a bit of digging to some great tracks and a small yorkie bar later , my second bit of food all day the other was a jaffa cake, we set off again to the current residence of Adams sister in hope of something to drink which for me was a whole lot less than everyone else, I wasn't really in a drinking mood that kind of time when it just tastes like the foulest thing you ever thought of regurgitating. A bit of walking later and we go to my house minus Adam so I can get&nbsp;the MUSE and Nirvana albums he lent me&nbsp;then Ben goes back home, a bit of resting later thinking of where on earth we will go later ends with my dinner being considerably later than I hoped and Ben and Adam calling round a the whitch end of the house rather than the happy kitchen end, the gate won't lock you&nbsp;in&nbsp;of its own accord. Anyway one burger later we go down to yonder almost empty warehouse thing and discover nothing much to be used at that present time. So we head down the next street past another group of allotments and ending up at piggin wood I think its called but I don't think that sound right now. A rest in a rather serial glade the light levels made it especially good we head back with some loud band coming from some where and a unnerving bright light hovering in the sky before dimming away a late watching of X-rated the pop videos they tryed to ban which was nothing like I had expected and rather worse that I had hoped I went and played on the computer a bit then went to bed  25th was so dull dull dull did nothing what so ever of any importance except stay up until four to be woken at eight yea with is eight today with has been spent listening to System of a Down rather louder than is probably wise as nobody apart from Jenks is here at the moment so if I continue this barrage&nbsp;I can prevent myself from thinking to much about how crap life is whoop de do.  anyway until I can next be bothered to write a blog bye bye

         Being as though my (kind of dreams) have been quite interesting and my day today has not I decided today I would write up some of my dreams do I remember them even tough their pretty stupid dreams, in the most part ill write them anyway.  cue dream 1 here start with a panoramic view of a huge dark mansion set in a garden the surrounded by a wood, go through mid air to the door and go in, skip&nbsp;a load out that I cant remember properly but I assume it was to do with walking round the house I get the feeling was completely empty for at least a few years.  Ok on to the next detailed part, I'm in a room plain and dark, stripped back to the floorboards, then for some reason I move a floor board and out come a big spider, not D&D style giant spider but a bigger than average spider, it starts to talk, can't remember what it says but it generally tells me some history with somehow involves some of the people I wasn't friends with at school and a weird host, this part involves satanic pentagrams and a little imp the rest I can't remember properly, but some how goes onto some mode of transport I think a bus the dream end when the bus explodes in a hilarious way, well as funny as a bus of people exploding can be.  later that night, a dream involving a large area of what stereotypically in my mind is exactly what welsh countryside looks like, anyway I'm stood inside&nbsp;an old stable looking thing with the likenesses&nbsp;of Ben and Jenks while talking to some guy with the intention of us buying an large area of land in order to do something with it can't remember.  a third dream I had I can't even begin to remember probably trying to hold to many images in my head in one go but it is far easier when your not actually asleep but you still don't remember the full thing.  in conclusion I think these a slightly influenced by the fact that it is just over a week before I go on holiday to a welsh forest get away. hurrar for me. Fortunately I'm not going in a bus and to my knowledge Ben and Jenks aren't going so I wont be buying any large plots of land.  right that's it for the dreams I'll just include a little bit about today keep getting told to return this pile of school textbooks I've got next to me but I can't be bothered to make that journey just for a business reason. The constant complaining is annoying but I can stand it, just about, what has heartened me is learning that Cathryn (I hope never had to spell it before) was at Marks house woo yea hoopla that made me chuckle doctor hibert style well that me for today your not getting anymore, unless I remember that third dream again.  So bye for now see you again for another rather dull installment of&nbsp; "parts of my life not so extremely boring I can be bothered to&nbsp;write them down".

         Read that off the back of someones t-shirt at my little bro's final assembly that i just went to kind of made me think off the legions of those dubbed chavs by us 'different' people who dont realy follow anything or anyone except a common goal which usualy contains anarcy even if you dont think it does to some degree it will. Anyway on&nbsp;to today i did little or nothing this morning and at about 2 went to see my brothers final assmbly which i have already said, it was ok but not brilliant apparently it wasn't as good as my years final, ha ha i am the best lol, but still it was funny in places but mik taking the teachers thrice was&nbsp;a bit dull by the end, well that was about the only highlight of the last three days except nearly roasting my hand off in a circle of flame experiment that didn't quite go to plan woo yea, oh yes and getting to shoot my bow into an old bathtub was quite fun as well them things are tougher than i thought. well i havent done much of anything appart from that not even been up to cheak on the usage of yonder feild and get a good video of it yet, i've got to do that some time but its just not far enough away and i don't like&nbsp; going short distances for some unknown reason it just doesn't feel right. bye bye for my last 3 days have been ultimatly boring i do hope eveyones have been a lot better than mine.

         Hello there everyone who reads my blog and possibly the weirdo who left a comment,  ill talk about this a minute while I remember after being show it by Ben I think firstly wow a comment secondly I collapse in a fit of laughter. Then comes the thinking I cant work out whiter it is a joke, an attempt at a slur on me, or just some random anonymous dude who has no life and wants my details for sex websites. If the first good un I laughed my head off about it, if the second then I'm afraid you've failed miserably and I would be more offended if you called me by my real name(not very) you obviously fall into the large group we call idiots, if the last one how about no you sick fuck, perhaps if you told me who on earth you were rather than leaving an anonymous comment and then I would still not tell you the only people who need to know about me are my freinds. In conclusion&nbsp;get a life, my philosophy is (as is well put by my anime life) "love is for the weak" if you are weak go out and get yourself a boy/girl if you are a sad lowest denominator of the internet you are using sex sites go away and don't come back without a name, as for details if you search around you'll find I live in proximity to Derby in England I no longer&nbsp;put my real name down on the net and&nbsp; hate you. I doubt you'll read this but hey&nbsp;I feel good about it. Right mad rant about how people like that annoy me over on with the general description of the day, started boring as per usual but later when with Ben to 'acquire' a no unauthorized persons beyond this point sign and then to our cool field which I will one day get a good video of so everyone who wants to can see it, then back home for another dull day and then watched some highlights from download which channel four had on, which I was surprised at,&nbsp;then wrote this.  after another blog&nbsp;after a boring day as usual I say goodbye again and don't come back without an identity anonymous person, I hope you hate me ill add a line to my wall oh wait its already black.

        in which case i've been doing alot of denying recently, which is strange. anyway i have been on the 5 minuites and i already dont like this new layout so if this blo screws up it was bloggers fault not mine. and now for a general picture of the last few days RYL, tv at a stupidly late time at night and&nbsp;3 -4&nbsp;hours of sleep a night which i catch out of sheer&nbsp;bordom. anyway yesterday bering in mind this is saturday just really really early went on one hell of a wander out to firstly the possible camp site, which apparently has 'to good to be true' syndrome, witch ill put a video up of to show the lay of the land up later. Secondly we were on our way to hermits cave by way of a scary old witch house with a "no children" sign located nearby then leading to an overly long rest at the bottom of a hill back up and on to hermits cave.  chapter 2&nbsp;-&nbsp;Hermits cave and beyond once there the song firestarter come to mind, only because of its title&nbsp;this is a genral idea of what happened we found a fire breathing cave marshmellows got rosted and so ,nearly, did my face.&nbsp; THANKS JENKS! *bald takes a deep breath* no not realy i bearly even noticed it at&nbsp;the time. after that we headed off for bartolwood (?) lodge which to an immenstly stupid ammount of walking to recive coke and a disspointing bowl of chips for a bloody rip price, i suggest never going there again, unless you intend on having a vinegar drinking competition, fair to say ben won, and i learnt that i still cant stand the stuff. then after more walking i got home for a short break befor going out to set alight a few more things with ended up as a seach for pipes and a spell at the redhill bbq which turned out to be more wank than a somthing i can't describe. the day was rounded of learning my brother couln't get a ruler straight in his head and genraly getting angey at that. well now in true cronological order i will go from the end of yesterday yo the start of the day begining tuesday&nbsp;13th&nbsp;&nbsp;i cant remeber much of what actualy happened that day except we went to find a suitable camp site and demolitions zone. the camp site possible being the best thing we have ever found just need to try and gain permmisions as this site has the main drawback of being blindingly obvious to the farmer, i now i think i know where the to good to be true comes from. but yes that was genraly the main picture of the day, the night well that was fun got grounded and banned from the net simply for not showing my mum the message i was typing to a frind, in my oppinion a message, is like a email, is like a letter, which is private unless the recipiant chooses to share. wednesday proved how stupid an idea that was as i was allowed up to jenks to help him look after his little baby brother, human sack of innocence,&nbsp;so i was out and&nbsp;then on the net but not able to do eveything i wanted including blog it just wasn't a private cozy enough enviroment to sum up to days and i couldn't do it. when i finaly got back it as quite late and i sat straight infont of the tv to stay up untill about 5 yey what fun. thursday was pretty boring and nothing happend at all relly except my bans being lifted when i did some work. that leads nicely onto friday when we went to hermits c..a... oh i alreay did this bit, lol. so on to saturday which&nbsp;have spent the last hour and ten minuites of wrighting this blog. so blog done im now going back on RYL for a bit untill i get so tired from lack of sleep and the massive walk yesterday that i cant keep my eyes open unless that doesnt happen. well after what seems to have for me been the most exciting part of my life for a bloody long time. yours with realy bad spelling because i cant be bothered to check it BALD the guy you love to hate. afterthought- man my usual lifes so boring thanks Ben, Adam, Adam (choose which one which) and jow im glad we went on that rather ludicrous adventuer another afterthought - im damm well thirsty BYE BYE eveybody.

      Hi eveybodys (small crowd) Hi Dr Bald  today has definitely been considerably better than the whole of the weekend put together, which defiantly shows how crap the weekend was. surfice to say I did absolutely nothing at the weekend except start meditation every night and getting sleep after it normally because in so relaxed well today I went with Adam and Ben on another stupidly expensive trip to see Shriek 2, I've probably spell that simple title wrong but what the hell, furthermore yea it was a good film and was worth the money I payed for the ticket, perhaps not for the transport but well you cant have it all and its not like I'm short on cash anyway. my favrorite characters were puss in boots and the king but only because his voice was John Cleese who I like because he's funny puss in boots however just rocked a swashbuckling cat how cool is that and a brilliant acting voice really went with the character. in other news today I've borrowed Absolution and Origin of symmetry for a day of Ben there all set and ready to give back so I can guess I'll spent the night getting depressed, which I need after a moderately joyous day. my thought of the day was after the film I thought about the PG certificate, I don't see the point in it at cinemas at least because parental guidance suggest that the parent would have to of already seen it to give guidance on it and if they had seen it why on earth are they going again, it just confuses the hell out of me stupid whoever thought up PG. Well that's all for now boys and girls see you again, BYE!

         Hi everybody, I decided on a colour change sorry I missed yesterday but blogger was playing up and it seemed to have not been working. Anyway about yesterday, some good time was spent out with friends in a tour of a large part of spondon spreading both great music via my sound bug and games of Frisbee via Ben's Frisbee other than that it was an extremily in boredom thanks for the invite you saved me from the clutches of doom so that used up most of my time and i'm glad it did. well onto so far today i'm beginning to feel the edges of being tired but after an active, hot day yesterday and so far an active, hot day today you may think its not hot today but think of sources of heat. I don't think its surprised. So far I've melted to yogurt pots filled my hole garden with smoke, or so it seemed, but we've not managed to make anything explode this may soon be to change as I've learned jenks has an almost unused chemistry set which could be indeed fun. Anyhow I've not done me insane thinking yet so I cant write any angsty storys not that I normal do but I have thought about angst and I think general angst is caused by emotion and being as though at the moment I'm not feeling to much emotion I'm not feeling much angst unless of course you consider emptiness angst well that's all I can think of for ne its not late enough and I wasn't feeling to up to the task of blogging in the firstplace, so for now goodbye

         Once again hello you'll probably be glad to know i have given up saying everything twice, twice i no longer say everything, lol. well I'm glad that i was able to go with my chemistry experiment i didn't get chance last night but this afternoon left me by myself except Jenks so we had ago the end result was two melted plastic things and the smell of jack throughout the whole house yumm straight to the head. Unfortunately although it was fire it was a kind of miserable fire and probably a waste of space on my PC but its there if you want to see a pathetic little fire my next idea is to nurture some yeast and grab some better bleach the one i used is an extremity in weakness so I'm not surprised it failed which you could almost here me say if Jenks hadn't stop recording half way through the sentence. well other than that today's been very intresting as that kindly a memory and Jenks remembered this site,  urlLink totse  which is a very useful resource site for... Interesting ideas. also loud music almost no sleep for the past 4 day tonight will be without tonight As well but i must say I've let my mind slip a few times and i have been to sleep a bit over the nights well don't know what I'm going to watch tonight. yea i must also mention my brothers going on a school adventure trip thing so i get a free room soon YEA I love having no brother in the room he's so damm loud and could stay quite to save his life I bet. well that's it for tonight remember I've got that video and if I die in the next few weeks I've either blown myself up or poisoned myself with the chemicals or perhaps been arrested some of these ideas make a bang louder than a shotgun, yea. well goodnight for now people see you tomorrow.

           that repeat i am to going now or at least everything i now type happens twice. Well today has again been really boring and so I've come back with the idea of repeating everything i say but not exactly, so conversations get massively annoying, in order to do this I'm not going to type a very long blog, i will say I've had only about five hours of sleep the past three days (including this one) and i don't intend o giving up when i previously said and I'm going to keep it up as long as i can, also tonight my plan is to go (the one where i intend to blow something up) that is weather and parents permitting, parent not giving permission but them not saying i can't will do. A sudden spark of inspiration has come to me and i also thought "i know why don't i film it" so my camera is now on charge and if you want to see it tomorrow just ask if it fails you can witness my miserable failure at chemistry as well if i die in the process let a wild animal climb over me and give me no burial as well as many other things which might cause vampirism even the speculative ideas well that's enough as  i am now going to repeat that at least everything i type or happens now twice. Really again today has been well boring and the idea of repeating myself is what i have come back with not exactly though, conversations therefore get quite annoying, so because of this a long blog i am not going to type. for the past three days i will say five is the number of hours i have slept(this day included also) when i previously said giving up i no longer intend to do as long as i can I'm going to keep this up. my plan for tonight will go (blow something up is what i will do) parents and weather need to allow it though, that's parents not denying the plan not the plan being allowed. Inspiration has also been sparked for me and i thought this "i will film the proceedings" on charge is what my camera is thus now on, so the day following today you might want to see either my success of failure at chemistry so ask you should, should i die in the attempt allow no burial and animals of the wild climb over me also anything that is rumored to cause vampirism even the quite rumors that is now enough  damm that sucked sucked damm that did

         is no sleep what a good idea. I intend to go this whole weekend without (or as little a possible) sleep this has started out pretty well with the being away all but an hour of last night and the not feeling one bit tired even though its half 9 now. i think tonight will pass me with an excess of iron brew and both the x men films because I've just seen some of the first on T.V and though I've not seen that in ages, if that doesn't last the night i guess ill turn to trusty ,mostly, crap videos on Kerrang, Scuzz and whatever else might be playing rock, well i might get to see the sugar video again which i have so far managed to see only 1 and a bit times which really sucks as its a cool video. anyway enough of what I'm going to do and onto the what i did and thought about today in a vague amount of detail, again wondered why can they have a kind of school for this holiday where if you want to you can turn up totally voluntary and the teach you stuff you don't need to know but is really, really fun, such as terminating programs on other peoples computers, lol! or random other stuff that perhaps you might find in the enrichment programs at collages, it'd be a laugh and probably quite dangerous oh well bring in the chaos on a truck this is normal my thought when i get to an extremity of boredom, which was all day except a rockin game of unreal with Ben including the tie game with only ended when a random guy came in only to get his head removed by a well placed sniper shot before he had chance to move, quite a good shot for an end game, i just wish that sever would get a new set of maps. well that's just about been my day except a brief period trying to get the grip back on VB, with a daunting 750 page technical book this is difficult to build up the patience to do it, but I'm resolute that I've got to be able to say i Can already write VB and some C++ to the computing teacher when he goes to teach programming with Pascal, crap but oh well its another language to learn and more famous than the other languages it came out with or at least I'd heard of it while not the others, well enough of an old, it seems computer tekkys talk which probably is massively inaccurate but oh well there's the doubt kicking in. well that's all i can think to type for now so ill leave you with a few things which got me trough the afternoon  -  urlLink The Crimson Room   -  urlLink The Viridian Room, sequel to, The Crimson Room   -  urlLink The Mystery of Time and Space  if the links don't work its not my fault and just ask me if you that desperate to play them. hope your day was and continues to be good until you go to sleep remember some of us aren't so sleep for me i cant be bothered, right bye bye. Stop pointlessly typing bald *hits himself* *thud*

         Howdy I'm bored already so I'm going to blog even if its going to be crap. i can see already that today is going to be a boring and so thought filled day, this is probably not good as thinking to deeply usually leads to an angst filled day which is not to good. I'm going to try and ply myself away from this but boughts of having to work are going to disturb anything i try to do, which is if i can manage it learning some more VB and if that ,as it will, gets boring I'll try to do flash and eventually other less acceptable activity's ,interpret how you want, and probably more tests for my chemistry experiment, hmm yes that way sounds less dangerous. in other news my MP3 has a new battery so will be a lot louder and it also has some new songs including : Muse - Hysteria, Muse - Muscle Museum, Muse - Stockholm Syndrome, Muse - Plug in Baby, Muse - Bliss, SoaD - P.L.U.C.K, SoaD - Boom!, SoaD - Mind & SoaD - Suggestions, SoaD - Ego brain so a good number and I'm surprised they all fit, anyway they bring me to a total of 56 tracks with a bit a room still left. well I've been thinking about the future especially so at collage and i cant see what the hell I'm going to do if i don't get in and i know its my own fault for being so lazy and paying no attention the whole time, I've been trying to tell myself its not to worry about yet but my less that very active mind has been flicking to it a lot recently i half want to be back in school rather than sat here with to much time with which i don't have enough things to keep me active with, i can also see my upcoming holiday might bring some form of enlightenment as i get to spend a whole week in a house buried in woods with no mains electricity so I'll be away from everyone thinking and listening to depressing music no doubt. ahh to be the me two years ago no worries no concern for the future and no crucial exam results that keep your thoughts on failure when your trying to blank your mind. Well i guess you can only wait and see. well now I've given myself a lot to think about and I'm probably going out to the woods again to see what's in my mind. well goodbye people hope you didn't fall into to deeper sleep whilst reading.

         sorry about last night my mum has been really strict recently. Probably me being around to much lol. i also as you can see scraped the idea of editing my post much easier like this with a blank page. well the first thing i figure i should write about is the last 1 and a half days at bilborough, it was definitely a most great time and me hopes to see the same and more people in September. I'm only slightly worried about you not seeing me but oh well that's not to worry about yet. but it seems great far less pressing and a more friendly atmosphere but learning teachers first names might be a bit much ohh well I'll have to call people hey you and excuse me mam(even when there obviously a dude) further more i thought long about stuff last night and I'm going to try to be as a calm frozen(or at least very cold) lake, this might not seem to be much of a difference to some people but I'm definitely not where i want to be yet, so anyway this is just a short blog as I've just got back from town and been to sleep again, and now I'm going to no man's wood, if you know where it is and go there for two you might find me, but i do not expect anyone to be there this is just a note i added to make my blog longer, woot. be back later bye for now people.

      Hello again, yes unfortunately for everyone I'm back from my short cut holiday which is probably a good thing. anyhow yes I'm back and in conclusion my holiday was mostly boring and slow but I guess it did have some advantages like giving me a whole lot of bites and a number of odd experiences and sights. but now I'm back I'm straight back into a life style I like even if its unrealistic and probabally rather stupid to spend all your time out with friends doing nothing in particular ignoring your lives problems but it's good while it last. Well today I went to town and wanderer round a bit with Ben and Adam which is something I do almost never and that's just the going to town bit nevermind who with. We then went to the UCI and saw I,robot which was good if you don't care about watching a long strained storyline involving the rules of robotics, so if you leave any other robotics story outside and like more of a storyfilm than action ,that the film does have just not in huge quantity but anyway I thought it weren't to bad despite having played through that story hundreds of times. in a more I'm now back and thinking about stuff I heard today sort of writing in annoyed that people find it fun to break into someone else's email address and send out hate just because of an opinion they have I quite frankly don't care what opinion someone has of me so long as it isn't a dangerous opinion and that the truth of an event should always be know not twisted to invent an event is not as bad because you can choose not to believe it if someone twists it and you believe it didn't happen you deny that anything happened at all I kind of find it hard to type out what I think about this kind of stuff but to put it really really bluntly and towards what I think is the event who cares if someone is annoyed at you because of how you acted one day and even more so why would you care what someone thinks about someone who isn't even part you why get so touch about it and start a vendetta again a person because of how they think, unfortunately I can do nothing for the self destructive nature of the human race and this is a classic example of it. Of course I could be jumping on the tail of the wrong rat and if it turns out so sorry. To the people here I say don't through hate and hide, if someone you think you know insults you on the net or something you disagree with talk t them personally especially if its out of character the internet a dangerous place emails are easily forged, mail account easily broken, don't trust anything is a unrealistic idea but apply it where evey you deem necessary this may have made little sense, I never think I do but everyone might draw something out from here. Anger over my holiday will eventually be blogged up but 7 days of stuff all need typing up from paper and I've been out most of my waking hours, oh yes and I gave up thr colors to much fuss for everyday until the next day goodbye all those people who read this. if your insulted talk to me I wont hate you for an opinion, perhaps admiration will come into it, that you dare and that is something I don't give out often so yes bye bye thanks for listening to an old mans whittle.
