      'W-who is  there,  spe ak   u-up', said  the  queen  of  hearts, looking  around   her  black  cas tl e,  looking  around  cautiously,  eyes-large  and  worried,  sweat  pouring  from  her  forehead,  still  looking  around  the  dark,  scanni ng  for  any  sign  of  movement. . .     Then,  a  hand   came  from  behind  her  throne,  covered  her  mouth,  and  a  sharp   blade  pointing  at  her  fat  throat. . . The  queen  made  a  little  squeaking  sound,  a  sound   of  terror,  a  helpless  sound.   'Shhh. . . . quiet, Queen. . . It  is  I. . . Alice-' the  queen  felt  the  eerie   voice  from  behind  her,  when  the  voice,  slip  through  her  ears . . . her  eyes  widened  with  fear,  as  if  bulging  out.  'Do  not  be  afraid,  queen,  we're  going  to   have  a  little   tea  party. . .-' the  queen   struggles  to free  her  fat  mouth  from  Alice's  hand,  and  make  another   squeaking   sound.      'Well,  hope  we  just  don’t   wet  th e  cards  from the  very-very  hot  tea. . . . .'  'Mmmmm!' another  squeak  from  the  queen.     [Coming  soon . . . . ] M.O.A

      .  .  .   And  the   Chesh ir e  Cat  Says, 'My  My  Al ic e,  Dear  Alice,  Why   Do  y ou  want  to  come  back  here  again?',  with  the  habit  of  the   permanent  smile,  stains  of   fresh  blood  around  it's    teeth,   with  the  eyes  of  the  grim . 'Once   again,  dear  friendly  cat,  I am   here   once  again ,  to  cut  the  queen's  throat   once  and   for  eternity.  .  .  ‘said  Alice  gracefully, following with  a  simple  bow. ‘So  shall  it  be. . . ', said  the   cat, and   disappeared.

       The pain that  left years ago seems haunting me back again, I do not want to have the same mistakes making a fool out of myself, hurting my closest friends and also being a person  whose heart hurt every  single night  from the invisible. The  mirror  that always show something that I can’t resist having. I said to myself that it’s against the rule, it’s against the law, if  once I break the principle, my life will be empty, or dead. I really need it to complete what I lost. I need it, yet I cannot have it. I can’t. Its so pain to  see  it moves, talks and breathes single, or maybe it has been taken, but its so lonely, yet there might be someone that  found it  1st or attracted it. It is so beautiful, so beautiful that your eyes could just  cry warm tears that kill. (I can’t take the pain any longer, I have to tell, but yet, I can’t  br eak  the rules… I love; I love it  really really much , more then anything, yet its against the rules…)
