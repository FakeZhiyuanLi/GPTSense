      I recently received an email from an old college friend; in it was a forward from Moveon.org in regards to Michael Moore’s latest piece of propaganda.  I have heard capsule news blips about this PAC, but did not know much about it in terms of specifics.  So in true conservative fashion, I researched this group before passing judgment.  Contrary to popular liberal belief, we conservatives do not make cursory decisions about any group.  Let me just say, what I read did not surprise me at all. This group is soo far to the left; they are practically up Stalin’s ass, no surprise.  With this better, not total, but more than I started with understanding of the type of people this group represents; I have come to the conclusion is just the same hypocritical bullshit these people have been dishing out for years.  In relation to the before mentioned email, it does not surprise me that these people think they are being censored; they all think there is some vast right wing conspiracy or some form of star chamber out to suppress their voice.  I only have one thing to tell them, “put the bong down.” I have never encountered a group a people that hate America soo much, I do no think the Warsaw Pact hated us as much as these people, and to top it off, they are fellow Americans.  Maybe because I think there is a logical reason for any believe I have a difficult time understanding liberal thinking.  The only impression I get is that they are mad they are not God, which in itself is contradictory since they are all secularists.  They preach and preach that they are some transcendent voice of democracy in the nation, but they really preach totalitarianism.   Hypocrisy; these are the same people who claim be the voice of the common man the world round, but most are elitists who only want freedom for Juan to mow their lawns.  Liberals believe in nothing but their own personal power incentive, not equality for all, and history have proven this point.  Democrats are a segregationist party, when Strom Thurmond ran for President he was a segregation Democrat; fact.  Even today, every member of congress (with the exception of David Duke) exposed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan was a registered Democrat.  Most people do not hear such facts, because liberals are spinning dervishes, hoping to see themselves as God when they stop. If anyone wants to see Fahrenheit 9/11, go ahead it is your right.  Make sure you read your side view mirrors before you go in, because the bullshit is closer than you think. My final point, I think Michael Moore is a Nazi in the closet.  The two are very similar: they used film as propaganda, and claim to be superior to everyone else.  Also, it is no coincidence the first half of his title is taking from Fahrenheit 451, a tale of fascism.  Maybe Mr. Moore should read a book before burning them (which is still too good for his book, which I would not even wipe my ass with).

      I started out for my trip back to California on Sunday, it’s now Monday morning and I’m trapped in the Las Vegas airport terminal.  It wouldn’t be that bad of a hold over, I mean its Vegas baby; the only city in the world with the all you can eat buffet is the base of the food pyramid and porn lines the street.  In the words of Greg Wittman, “Heeeey.”  He’s no Fonzi, but you get the idea, well those of you with at least some measure of cognitive awareness.  This is one of those events that one thinks will never happen to them, until it does.  Even in a town known for 24hr. anything and soo much iniquity that leaves me even hard spoken (or maybe it’s due to the fact that I’m stuck in an airport terminal, still on East Coast time) there’s nothing open.  I’m the one who the airlines gave the prison neophyte handshake here, forced to suffer and sit in the limbo of foul smelling Euro-trash and toothless hicks (God they’re everywhere), because I got stranded here after midnight and the first flight out is a 6 a.m. talk about being fucked; not even a proper one at that.  So what do I do to pass the time, I already watched Kill Bill, which only knocked off two hours out of the five that I’m here.   To make things worse, I don’t even have a direct flight back to Ash Tree (Fresno for my bilingual disciples) I have to connect in Phoenix.  We must not forget our friend Murphy and his law, which in some demented jest will send me to Atlanta at least six times before finally encountering some Godzilla related turbulence.  After this experience, I wonder why more people don’t have air rage?  Once you cross the security checkpoint, say good bye to any dignity you might have left; you’re in the airlines universe now.  In one hand they have your luggage, and in the other your nuts in a vice grip.  Flying is like being stuck in some sort of feminist rally.  No matter what you say or do, be it something or nothing, you’re just WRONG!  It’s like being five years old again, they lose your bags, it’s your fault, you miss your connection because of the weather, well you should’ve ran faster when you got here.  I like to take this moment to once again thank those fucking Muslim extremists for taking air travel from being an experience comparable to that of visiting that unknown aunt in Sun City who smell like cat pee, to a chimeric demon spawn of nothing less than a root canal administered by a proctologist while waiting in line at the DMV.   After this Faustian nightmare ends, I’ll find myself back home asleep, dreaming of Elysian Fields and cherubic creatures, surrounded by nothing less than utter contentment.  Then I’ll wake up, realize I slept my entire trip away, and have to repeat this same ordeal all over again.  If Dante did not write his account of the fiendish design of Six Flags over Pandemonium, I’m sure someone trapped in an airport would have dreamt up something similar.  Except, his name would be Steve.  It has been over thirty hours since the start of my intrepid trek west.  I find myself finally in Phoenix, where it’s 8 a.m. and it’s already 105 degrees.  One would think that such a temperature soo early in the day would preclude people from buying their “yuppie-cino” at Starbucks. To my surprise (sarcasm emphasized) it’s the longest line in the terminal.  Besides my earlier observation a while back on the white-trash constant in the universe; apparently conformity and pack mentality has not been bred out of the species.  This time, maybe eugenics should be considered.  This is a perplexing issue for me, in that my family came to America in the early 1900’s during the first eugenics crisis.  But since such an action has no effect on my lifestyle and personal wellbeing at the present; I’m all for it. God I need a shower.  This not like camping in the woods where you expect to smell like raw hide and cougar scat.  There are some places and or surfaces that people are innately phobic to be around and touch.  Airports, every single minuet lepton, makes me want to pine for a hospital bed in a clean room with Kleenex box slippers, while proudly displaying jars of my own urine on the shelves.  P.S. Thanks Howard for the prime model of hypochondria.  What’s funny, in regards to hygiene, (unfortunately this is Jerry Seinfeld funny) I know I smell, traveling thousands of miles with no chance of even washing my face and sleeping in nasty airport art-deco reject chairs.  But today, a new day, people who smell worse than a wet wombat surround me.  At least I have an excuse, what’s theirs, “I couldn’t find a stick long enough to put a wash cloth on to wash myself.”  You fat bastards, I have nothing but disgust and contempt for you people.  Hey, guess what? There’s someone here to meet your Krispy Kreme filled ass at the terminal; it’s your good friend diabetes, and look there’s heart disease and his nephews colon cancer and arthritis.  Too bad, I feel sorrow for these four horsemen of the obese apocalypse; because they have to grease up your fat ass and stuff it in a piano crate to send you straight to caloric hell!

      Murphy and his damn law strike again, either that, or some wacky gypsy voodoo mumbo jumbo is going around.  Even though a coincidence is a statistical anomaly, one can't deny it as the initial thought one has when the universe responds to one's bitching.  What's next, a black cat is going to walk by twice, which is not entirely a bad thing; especially if Keanu Reeves spouts his most famous line of "Whoa" from  The Matrix.   Maybe this is a sign of my hidden voodoo shaman powers.  I pity the fools that have wronged me in the past, cause it's time to unleash some torturous voodoo doll juju.  Since my "shit list" is ten times the size of Nixon's, it gonna be awhile before I get through everyone.  I know there's not a whole lot of depth and explanation for what can only be a funny, peculiar, and strange indeed day and subsequent analysis.  But if you want detailed analysis, listen to Bill Walton.  At least he's funny.

      You know that there's something wrong with a place if it's too quiet the entire afternoon. According to the Golden Globes of magazines, U.S. News and World Report, who instead of being journalist publish nothing but a series of "best and worst" lists.  According to these  crack  (as in smoking it) journalists, the optimal places for the average American to live is some white bread, zero crime, WASP suburb where conformity and routine is just not the rule, it is dogma.    Sunday in burbs, not a peep from even the streets.  No Sunday drivers, to wild kids running around in  nothing but a crap filled diaper, not even one minor domestic disturbance.  No place on Earth is suppose to be this dull.  No noise, no crime, no businesses open the entire day, come on!  We all have our moments of living in the past, but a whole community that is still trapped in the 1950's?  No wonder suburban house wives are alcoholics and their husbands have a sick obsession with yard equipment. "Hey Mr. Cleaver, put down the rake, pick up the shotgun, cause some mindless havoc, then crawl into a corner, assume the fetal position, and reminisce on you molester uncle.  This place is starting to scare me.  One day, I feel that a deranged Bavarian mob will be beating down my door, armed with torches and pitch forks.  Mobs never hunt or try to skim the excess of their own skim milk cloister; they go after the green guy who doesn't speak the language.  It's no coincidence that life imitates fiction, hopefully I'll hear whatever ominous musical interlude tickles my fancy, before the mob is within sight.   Who am I kidding, that will never happen.  Such behavior requires independent thought, which is not present here.

      Growing up in California's San Joaquin Valley, summer usually meant triple digit temperatures and poor air quality. At least the sun was out, not like this fucking region that I currently reside.  Staring out the window at the continuous gray shroud that masks the sky, only one thought comes to mind...this is hell.  Buffalo is cold all year round, it doesn't matter if there's snow on the ground or some foul wind blowing off Lake Erie from Canuckistan, this place is as cold as a witch's tit.  It's days like this I wake up thinking Dante is going to knock at my door to see if I, "want to go see the frozen three headed Satan?"  It wouldn't be too bad if Satan was eternally chewing on Al Gore, Rosie O'Donnell, and a Frenchmen.

      Instead of posting some sappy opening thought or, apologizing for the lack of content and detail of this blog, I want to "rejoice."  During one of my many visits to FARK.com, to shed some light on the doldrums of another wonderfully boring day in Western New York, VH1.com posted a story that the touchy-feely, yea for Jesus, Stryker knock-offs, known as Creed are finished.  First of all, I am a metal head and don't particularly listen to Creed's "brand" of music, but anyone with one active neuron would also not be listening to those bible beating beats.  Who knows, maybe this so-called diaspora might spread to other melodic atrocities.  Britney Spears head might melt on stage, just like the Nazi in "Raiders of the Lost Ark," a satellite could fall on Dave Matthews, forever ending his nonsensical verbal diarrhea.  I would comment of today's Hip/Hop industry, but of course it's a business not an art form, and there's too much to bitch about and not enough time.  In short, it sucks!  Plus, "Everyone knows that all the best bands are affiliated with Satan."

      Unlike most Americans, I'm actually watching the Baathist Convention (aka DNC), and I'm just hearing four days of the same empty rhetoric that began with that blowhard Howard Dean. Of course I mean the Donkeys have no platform, they've been spouting out only two themes this entire week: The Republican platform and Kerry's bullshit military record. The later is the one that has me up at arms. I won't deny that here served his nation and I respect that. What bothers me is this man is just another Hanoi Jane, preaching anti-war rhetoric and just being a walking hypocrite. Compounding this issue is the "Ass" party trying to paint him as this great military hero and leader. I don't know about you, but aren't military brass usually the ranks of Generals and Admirals, the command staff that strategies the entire campaign, not a boat that requires you to shoot when shot at? Patton, Eisenhower, Nimitz, they were leaders; not this man whore.     Then there's the convention as a whole, touting and praising his military experience. These are the same people burned draft cards, ran to the UK, and spit on the troops when they came back from Vietnam. I guess history is another point liberals like to waffle on to suit their interests. What's next, Sodom and Gamorrah was just a misunderstood party, well at least according to Clinton.     We were also blessed with Michael Moore's interview with Bill O'Reilly this week. I hope the rest of the nation finally realizes what the lack of an education does to a mind. For those of you who don't already know, Moore does not have a high school diploma. This leads to my next point from the interview; Moore continually tries to bait people with questions that revolve around sending their children to Iraq. Such a question implies that we still have a draft or mandatory service in this country like the rest of the world. If Moore actually finished high school and was more objective in his views, he would realize that we have a 100%  volunteer  military. There's no one going around forcing 18 year olds at gun point to join up. When one joins the armed force, by default you are joining a group that it's mission to defend their nation through armed conflict. What do some of these "conscientious objectors" think they're joining? Guns, bombs, planes, etc. are implements of death, this isn't the boy scouts.     Go back to smoking out of your bong and being delusional you hippies, it's the only thing you do well.; and dream of your Swedish socialist paradise. Pathetic.

In this era of political correctness and victimization, the art of the sadist is as endangered as the spotted owl.    But, to quote Mark Poochigian, “…fuck the spotted owl…”    Ditto brother.    I’m not gonna give any examples for any of you wretched hacks out there; if you can’t think of inventive and unusual forms of torture on human chattel, then you are  not  a true sadist.    Tops on my lists of people that need a righteous fucking with (in no particular order) 1) PETA    2) ACLU 3) Michael Moore 4) Hanson.    I think those freak boys are just the trinity of the Anti-Christ.    If you think I’m going to justify anyone of these people/groups; then you’re mistaken.    I never explain myself to anyone. Why? I’m right, you’re wrong, just agree with me or I’ll revel at your exquisite torture at my own hands.    I don’t know why people give torture such a bad rep; it’s a very Zen experience.             Give it a try, you might just like it.    Just ask Mikey; he likes it!

      In a continuing fit of boredom, I have found myself watching the Gameshow Network on a Saturday.  God, my life sucks!  To my surprise, there's a show called "Extreme Dodgeball,"  is this a joke?  Are network execs smoking crack laced with Drain-o?  This reminds of that early 90's sports farce "Roller Games."  At least that show introduced the American public to such great bands, like Warrant and Slaughter.  Just kidding, they suck, like John Tesh. Everyone is getting a show nowadays, even if it's extended cable.  C'mon, white trash is even starting to break out if its Jerry Springer rut into more mainstream television.  Why not me, show would just have me sitting down, maybe with a panel or a guest or two, and I'd just bitch at whatever is pissing me off that day.  There's always something new for me to bitch at everyday, so content will never be a problem.

      I never have been so bored in my entire life.  There’s probably a lot to do around the greater Buffalo area, but I can’t find anything.  I can’t golf, since it’s always raining here, and I can’t shoot trap for the same reason.  I would go up and visit Toronto, but Canadians aren’t too fond of Americans nowadays, and knowing my mouth, the State Department would probably have to bail me out of some incident.  Along the same lines as the misadventures in Canada, spending time in some of the more interesting areas of Buffalo would be equally disastrous. In a community that is intellectually bereft, people here are amazing outspoken if you violate that status quo.  Maybe because I grew up and still consider myself a Californian, I stand out a little more than these blue collar slobs.  I don’t dress like an 80’s reject; I’m an outspoken conservative, not an ignorant and confused liberal.  I’m an intellectual, not a pop culture drone.  If this labels me a pretentious snob, who gives a fuck.  In a society founded on individuals being adventurous and different from the norm, why is it a crime here?   It’s just weird here, or overly simplistic, maybe that’s the reason why nothing and no one makes sense to me here.  Marx must be popular here, since everyone I meet here is strangely anti-capitalist.  Graduates students are the worst.  Here, they frown upon anyone who’s not starving for their education and doesn't live in a dive.  It doesn’t bother me that I’m nothing like them, or fit their model of a normal person. I like my apartment in the wealthy suburb; I like having a disposable income, and being able to go and do wherever or whatever I want.  If being wealthy leads to being ostracized, bring it on.  If you’re jealous that my family was able to make something of themselves after immigrating to this country after WWII, and yours still doesn’t now the value of dollar after over a century of American residency, to fucking bad.   This is not true for everyone. A “so-called” friend of mine follows this model to keep herself the queen of here little coop.  What is she afraid of; I don’t want your friends.  Bottom line is she’s scared of me; her little click has never encountered someone who’s the polar opposite of them who can rationalize his thoughts.  Liberal thinkers believe scientists cannot argue outside of the scientific method.  If being successful, well educated, and a member of Mensa (which none of them are) is a crime…then put me away.

      Thank God for liberals, without them I’d have nothing to write about today.  I read a news article from Yahoo News today that certain member of the US House are asking for UN representation in the forthcoming presidential elections, to ensure “free and democratic elections” (not a direct quote, but you get the idea).  I know little kids throw temper tantrums when they lose, but four years people come on, you lost.  The Florida fiasco did display some problems with how we  physically vote in some parts of this country, but did it occur under the guise of fascism or totalitarianism?  Of course not.  The Florida ballot was not like pre-war Iraq, with only one name on the ballot.  I’m sick and tired of this issue; Democrats who lost give it up, move on (like the name of their favorite PAC), but UN observers, what the hell are you thinking. It doesn’t matter that only five congressmen wrote to the UN, the fact of the matter is such an action sets a bad example politically, especially since we are trying to install democracy in Iraq.  What is this bullshit with today’s liberals; they need approval from outside sources for everything we do here.  I don’t know about you, but I don’t give a rat’s ass what those dirty French Fries with heir socialist and Anti-Semitic attitude think about anything.  Hey France, think about bathing regular you filthy cheese eating surrender monkeys!  Oh and Germany, a nation of fucking pacifists, they’re afraid to take a shit with someone holding their hand.  Hitler may have been crazy, but at least the Germany of old commanded respect, because it took no shit from anyone back then.  And these are the people you want to oversee the democratic process in America. First of all, fuck the UN; a body of no real governing power that today is only legitimized by our presence in all matters.  Does Koffi Anan really think he’s someone with his token position, does anyone know, or even care what third world cesspool he even represents.  Second, this letter was draft by the ethnically minority member of congress.  Nothing like Uncle Tom crying to the Arian and Anti-Semitic nations for assistance.  No wonder I have a headache, the spin and the contradictions are atrocious.   These people want this nation to become a socialist “paradise” apparently.  I feel like doing the Homer Simpson sarcasm dance when I read about crap like this.  That’s the problem with America today, nobody wants to solve their own problems, they believe in nothing anymore.  We are becoming that spoiled child that craves constant approval from everyone of little substance.  Maybe if today’s Democrats weren’t raised on John Hughes movie, we wouldn’t have these problems
