         I once did an interview on TV in Montreal   urlLink  (CH Canada)    on how we help the new students arriving in Canada. There, I met this very old and well-knowledgeable person who had come to give an interview too. What was interesting was that it was whether to believe in astrology or not.  The topic of discussion was on a certain article which appeared in a leading newspaper in London which talked about 200 people born on the same day at the same time at the same latitude. If astrological predictions were so true, then the lives of these 200 people should be the same, aint it? But in reality, the lives of these people were pretty different from each other. Hence, this article went on to conclude that people should not believe in astrology. This person had commented on that article stating that there are many points that these astrological predictions are based on. Some of the fundamental assumptions include the time of birth of a person. At times, a small error in noting the time might cause a whole new horoscope to be made for a person quite contradictory to the truth. Thus, he went on to explain that astrological predictions are true afterall.  This discussion got me thinking. My mom believes a lot in astrology and she has this habit of going to various astrologers for predicting hers as well as her children's future. I was always made to accompany my mum on these occassions. I always noticed that baring some small details, these astrologers never really gave the same prediction. Now, the same horoscope is shown to different astrologers. Yet, the predictions are different!       I was speaking to a friend of mine yesterday. He felt that the approach followed by each astrologer is different. Take up any scientific or medical breakthrough/research. For example, finding the cure to cancer. Each person in different corners of the world comes up with a different approach to cure the disease. I agree on that. But, each person strives to cure *the disease* aint it? Hence the conclusion has got to be the same. On the same note, I believe the predictions have to be the same too!      Nevertheless, we still believe in astrology, in rahu kaalam, in lucky gems. In my opinion, we should believe in God and believe that everything happens for good. It is impossible to try and predict the future. If it were possible, everybody would know what is gonna happen in their future. Lets say, somebody predicts that I am going to be an Engineer in the future. If I know it, why should I try hard for something I know I am gonna be! Also, lets say he/she also predicts that I am gonna have some bad times in say the year 2024. What can I do about it? Knowing the future only gets you worked up all the more. The whole curiosity factor is lost if you know what is gonna happen in the future, aint it?      So, in a way, by predicting incorrect/incomplete information, the astrologers are infact doing us all a favor! What ya say? :)
