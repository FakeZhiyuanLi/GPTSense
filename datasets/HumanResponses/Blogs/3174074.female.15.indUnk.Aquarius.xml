          well yesterday i was looking foward to hanging out wiht sal and bryant. but things didnt turn out the way i had expected....             i went to jessicas house around 3:15 and then we leave and go to walgreens. cause she wanted to get her pictures developed from the day before when she had went to finch. ha she got a pic with nate. her pictures turned out very good... im jealous. my pics from warped were horrible thats prob cause i was so far... and the camera sucked. so ya. then we call up adam and he says he's at jasons so we go there... but i guess jason and his dad went to get pool stuff cause their pool is green LOL. and they left adam to watch it. eh i dont really like jason he sorta creeps me out. but eh. jessica misses adam. so we just hang out on the porch... and tehn jason and his dad get back... and ya.. i dont know he's weird... and becky came. ha it sucked bry didnt know if he could hang out.. cause like his mom wasnt home -bummer- :( me and him have been wanting to hang out. eh. cause hes moving and not gonna be going to washington anymore it sucks. and we barely began to talk. and sal we were gonna call him up.. but werent sure if he would be home.. and we heard julie was with him and ya. dont like julie. and so her dad called her and wanted to see her and so we walk there cause it was a few blocks of where we were. so we walked through rowan park and we see michelle
