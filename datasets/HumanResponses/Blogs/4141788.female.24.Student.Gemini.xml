      We went cooking on Wednesday this week at the kitchen and we had sooo much fun!! Kourabiethes take SOOOO much sugar!! I was so sugar high when I came out of there! I was like"WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  Speaking of which, on  urlLink www.albinoblacksheep.com  there is this thing called "Weeee!!" aka Gonads and Strife. It is SOOOO freakin' hilarious and I laughed my @$$ off! Watch it. There is really no point to it, but it is funny just to hear what this thing says.  "WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!"  Also, there is one called "Bukkake" it's so STUPID but yet sooooooo funny when it's like 2 AM and you are fighting sleep. In one part it talks about Nagasaki, which was not funny, but sombering, but then later it gets dumb again. LOL. BUKAKKE!!!  I like bukakke! I like bukakke! I like bukakke!!   urlLink  !@#$   bukakke!!  urlLink  !@#$      bukakke!!!   Lol. Sorry. I'm sooooo tired. We ran for an hour and 10 minutes today nonstop (mostly) and I'm exhausted. But at least The Mile will be SOOO easy next year.  I'm tired. I talked to Jon today. I met him at band camp!!  (Jackie, please IM me if you get this. I have stuff to tell you....)  My baby is doing GREAT!! It's a boy!!! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!! (My friend Jackie thought it would be a girl! Nope!! I don't know what I'll name him!)  Eleftheria girls, IM me for the whole thing. LOL! I'm soooo excited!  Now I must sleep. We got some guy yelling about the US Gold medal last night drunk on Metaxa. LOL. it' was great. Also, if you haven't heard this one yet, Jackie, IM me!!!  Kali Nixta,  Annie  PS>> My blogs are always open for comments on stuffs I say here.....feel free to comment AWAY!!!!.....................................................................WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

      GRRR!!! This man can make me soo angry! Today he was talking about how having the Olympics in Athens was a big mistake. What a piece of crap!!!!!! He was making cracks about the Athenian guards and the Greek army and I just wanted to tell him to take his hiny back to America or the Greek army might.  GRRR!!!!   Annie (who is very pissed right about now)

      Ich HASSE Spike TV!! Es ist duss!!! Ach! They have  AGAIN  changed the time for Trek so now it is on at 10, not 8. grrr. I will obviously stay up until 11 for it, but I might fall asleep, which would ruin my spotless Trekkie image, so I'll tape it and sleep now.  Kali nixta,  Annie

      Now that I'm around all the ladies, I realize that I really have an accent. Different words like hope and really sound extremely Greek to my ear.    My yiayia is in the hospital for pnemonia. I REALLy want her to get better. On the phone today I says, "Παρακαλώ; Ακριβώς το δοκιμάστε έξω για μερικούς μήνες. It's πραγματικά μόνος εδώ χωρίς σας και σας χάνω alot. Παρακαλώ; Θέλω πραγματικά να σας έχω με." She said she didn't know if she would, but I REALLy want her to come to live with us!! To have her with us would be    HEAVEN   !! Uncle Vasili is really lonely in Athens and my Uncle Tassos wants  him  to come and live with  them . O, well. Greek family life is SO complicated. Everyone knows EVERYTHING about you.  It's quite amusing.  Hey Adrastosmou! S'gapoe! Kali nixta kai na klanies oule nixta!!! LOLOLOLOLOL!!!   S'gapoe,  Kali Nixta (really!!)  Athena (lol. Inside joke....remember last festival??)

      Tag, Leute! Was gibt's?? For those people not bilingual (the second language being German...na klar...) what I just asked is...WHATS UP??? Nothing much going on here, I'm just sort of chilling. Waiting until it's 8:00 tomorrow so we can go cooking up for our Greek Festival in September.  Herr Bruce, meinen ausgezeichneter Lehrer ist bleiben mit uns fuer ein paar Tage. Es ist wirklick toll weil er zuruek Illinois gehen ist. Sorry about that....my German grammar has gone downhill since I stopped taking German regularly at school. Good thing he's coming because he always helps me with my Deutsch. And my aunt's boyfriend is German, so he likes to talk to me in German, so I get tips from him.  Hey Kenny, if you have IM. If not, then...oops.  TAG HERR BRUCE!!! WAS GIBT'S?  I'm in the dance group Eleftheria at Prophet Elias, I'm Greek Orthodox and I'm 15.  Hey people I met at Band Camp!! What goes on with your band selves??? See you next year!!  I love you Adrastos!! (a.k.a. Tim...a.k.a. Niko....a.k.a. kouklamou) I can hear you talking to me....  This is probably THE MOST RANDOM BLOG  EVER  so I'll talk to you tomorrow.  Bis spaeter....Kali Nixta....Good night.....Guten Nacht....Bis Morgen....  FINE!! Bye!
