        This new segment will feature my choices for the most underrated movies ever…EVER. Now I don’t want this to simply be an opportunity to say which movies I liked that others didn’t, but to point out the gems that mainstream movie goers may have missed. The films that got lost in the craziness of summer blockbusters and Oscar season. For us to define an underrated movie, we must define what isn’t.  An underrated movie  cannot  be: - a Hollywood blockbuster (see exception below)  Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, The Rock, and any other Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer film       - a movie that has been praised by multiple critics (if the trailer has quotes from a newspaper stating something to the effect of “brilliant says so and so film critic snob from unknown, unreputable newspaper”, it would not qualify as an underrated movie)  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon – some people didn’t like it, I loved it and so did the critics, therefore, it is not an underrated movie      -well-known cult classics and obvious fan-favorites (they may have been underrated at one time, but everyone started liking them and instantly, the movie was thrust into this status)  The Goonies, The Karate Kid, Evil Dead series, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Jean Claude Van Damme movies      -Oscar-nominated films (if I need to explain why this would disqualify a movie from being underrated, well…)  Of course, with every rule, there are the obligatory exceptions:    - Hollywood blockbusters may qualify for the underrated list if and only if the movie completely tanked at the box office and/or was bashed by critics.  Waterworld, Battlefield Earth (although I wouldn’t put those on my list)    -Movies from a director whose other movies have been more popular. Now I know what you are thinking…”since Psycho was better than Vertigo, Vertigo counts as being underrated.” While you can make that argument because of this loophole, it would be much better to say that “Since Dogma was more controversial and got more of the spotlight, Chasing Amy is now eligible for a slot in the underrated movies list”  With that, here is the first inductee to the Underrated Movies of All-Time list:   Dark City  (1998) Director: Alex Proyas  Folks, this was The Matrix before The Matrix became the phenomenon called The Matrix. The art direction was beautiful. The lighting…shot composition…the editing…badass. The performances from the cast were awesome and Jennifer Connelly was elegantly stunning as usual. They had creepy-looking bad guys who chattered their teeth and made shit move around. Oh, and I think there was a midget in it too. Pretty rad, I must say.
