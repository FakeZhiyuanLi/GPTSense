      ...i hate people more than i hate people....i hate myself as being a person  i cant stand to be stuck in my own mind and start thinking about everything... it all just seems so trivial and it really bothers me...  i hate the fact that i apologize for everything, and i feel horrible about things i cant change.......and the worst part..... THEY ARENT EVEN THAT IMPORTANT!!!!!  i really just cant stand being around anyone....as happy as i may be in being with my "friends" i really cant stand anyone that much.... my thoughts of everything are so idiotic and insane that why should i share them with people...  i really honestly dont know anymore why people would want to be around me....as this being of self-doubt and self-pity anymore.....why am i honestly still here?

      yeah i have given up on listening  listening to other people's problems just gives you room to get invovled and i really cant take getting invovled anymore i get myself so hooked on how to help that i break myself apart  and yeah that seems selfish and hey ill be the first one to admit that i can be at times  but seriously if it doesnt directly concern me anymore... i need to stay out   so just watch out

      i am me i have come to the realization that i really cant change myself...as much as i may want to  but my problem is that i dont want to be me anymore... im sick of the lies i tell myself...even sicker of the lies i tell others im sick of the general purpose i seem to have now...of just someone to run to  i wish i could run to myself  i fear i have lost that essential thing that i need to survive on that one thing that is needed to keep myself going  i am here...but my mind wanders..to unthinkable depths in my multiple abysses that i have created  where can my mind be found now..

      sometimes you just need things you cant have  like that one person that one "them" that you always think about but they arent there  im thinking it kills me more knowing that they are there but "just a friend" than not being there at all  not that i have one or anything...  but anyways like i said sometimes you just need things...  god im gone

      All around me are familiar faces Worn out places Worn out faces  Bright and early for their daily races Going nowhere Going nowhere  Their tears are filling up their glasses No expression No expression  Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow No tomorrow No tomorrow  *chorus* And I find it kind of funny I find it kind of sad The dreams in which I’m dying Are the best I’ve ever had I find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take When people run in circles It’s a very very Mad world Mad world  Children waiting for the day they feel good Happy birthday Happy birthday  Made to feel the way that every child should Sit and listen Sit and listen  Went to school and I was very nervous No one knew me No one knew me  Hello teacher tell me what’s my lesson Look right through me Look right through me  *chorus*  And I find it kind of funny I find it kind of sad The dreams in which I’m dying Are the best I’ve ever had I find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take When people run in circles It’s a very very Mad world Mad world enlarged in your world Mad world

      my head is filled with thoughts of you and i losing ourselves in our minds   my heart is filled with the pain and grief that has been brought upon it by stupid mistakes never ment to be done   i need you back but i dont want you back   you were the best thing that could have happened with the joy and the love   but you have brought more sorrow than i could know   i want you to keep a reminder of you in my head or i want you to be shreaded to pieces right before my eyes  you are there haunting my mind in the same place of avoidance that i created for myself   i must find some sort of middle ground before this becomes my downfall

      how to write this...  its a love/hate relationship with love honestly i hate it so much i hate that feeling...or shall i say all those feelings...the "i cant deal without you" and the "you made me complete" crap because its not crap its the truth which is what scares me  i dont know how to deal with that though... i have always stayed for myself...me and me only... none of this "i need my guy to be there so im fine..." junk i dont know how to deal with the "us" instead of the "I"  i have broken hearts... no none of that heartbreaker junk...i just have because i couldnt deal with it but now its my heart and i want it back  i want him to give me my feelings back...i gave him everything i could...and i need it back  i fell too deep too fast  no more love for me

      "katherine you must lie because your opinions are wrong" "katherine you must lie because you arent worthy" "katherine you must lie because no one loves you, they lie too, its all just a mask"  my thoughts tell me to tell the lies i have become i have become what no one wants a hole  the "you have to swear not to tell"'s, the tears, the laughs...they are all just a part of the giant play i have created "All the world's a stage,  And all the men and women merely players..."(William Shakespeare, "As You Like It")  you are all just a part of a scene one block in an act of my life

      these are my thoughts these are me  i have become words on a page fragments of sentences all put together for people to read  my head has become a looking glass mirror that everyone sees themselves and all i see is in  i want to be on the other side i want to see my reflection i cant take the darkness that i have found in me anymore  it has consumed my mind along with the words and phrases that i have written  these forbidden thoughts and prohibited words have become my downfall and they are invisible to the world  i need to break down my mirror and let people in my cage needs to be collapsed

      my thoughts are meant to stay in my head they arent meant to be taken out and fooled around with im as serious as im going to get and you need to understand that  what i show to people is not what im safe showing it has become a hand to aide in my fight over what my reality has become and what is actually going on around me  do not take my words lightly and the apologies made are facades to block off what i dont want to hear anymore  im a coward to my own world...and i cant take the non-pressure there is anymore i need someone sitting there saying "just make it through the night...dont cry because you are strong...im not going to let you hang yourself with the rope we gave you..." all i feel now is "katherine you lie...katherine you are a drama queen...katherine get out of your head and just smile..."  yeah my smiles dont work anymore  just come find me

      mm k so i really have no clue what to write  im just going to let everything boil out till there is nothing left that i feel like saying  i have 10 years left to live i really honestly dont feel like living one more day  because honestly...why? what more is there to live for so im putting a timestamp on my life 10 years till im gone  love... i hate you all even the ones that i love with all my heart that there isnt a thing that they could do wrong i hate you because i cant stand loving you and letting anything go i need it all too much and i cant let myself need anything because whenever i let my self fall in...i just never stop falling  which is my problem "is this your reality or mine?" honestly am i living my life for you in your eyes? or am i living in my eyes and refusing to look?  i really am a good kid at heart...im always going to try and be that role-model that i cant achieve because i wont let myself get there my excuse: because i cant let myself win the minute i let myself win i shall never come back down  i lie i shall never leave here... i shall never leave my blanket from my room because im scared of what is out there... there are too many things that i refuse to face because i just may never make it to my 10 years...  but the problem is... im going to live to be 70 because i have lost control of my life

      Dude this is like scary. Everything I put down was right.  Take 3 minutes and try this...it will freak you out! The person who sent it to me said her wish came true 10 minutes after they read the mail. BUT NO CHEATING! This game has a funny/spooky outcome.   Don't read ahead...just do it in order! It takes about three minutes...it's worth a try  First..get a pen and paper. When you actually choose names, make sure it's people you actually know and go with your first instinct.    Scroll down one line at a time...and don't read ahead or you'll ruin it!   1. First, write the numbers 1 through 11 in a column.   2. Then, beside numbers 1 and 2, write down any two numbers you want.   3. Beside the 3 and 7, write down the names of members of the opposite sex.   NO LOOKING AHEAD...OR IT WON"T TURN OUT RIGHT!   4. Write anyone's name (like friends or family....) in the 4th, 5th, and 6th spots.  5. Write down four song titles in 8,9, 10, and 11.  GO WITH YOUR INSTINCT PEOPLE!!!!   6. Finally, make a wish.  And now the key for the game.....      1. You must tell (the number in space 2) people about this game.  2. The person in space 3 is the one that you love.  3. The person in 7 is one you like but can't work out.  4. You care most about the person you put in 4.  5. The person you name in number 5 is the one who knows you very well.  6. The person you name in 6 is your lucky star.  7. The song in 8 is the song that matches with the person in number 3.  8. The title in 9 is the song for the person in 7.  9. The tenth space is the song that tells you most about YOUR mind.  10. and 11 is the song telling you how you feel about life  NOW...send this to 10 people within the hour you read this...IF you do..your wish will come true. If you don't it will become the opposite.  interesting...very interesting

      	Ever since I was little, I have always had a form of it in my life. I need it there. It explains me. As I grew older my music seemed to begin to reflect my state of mind. Whether it be the stage of Hanson, N’SYNC and The Backstreet Boys with their own “unique” styles of bubblegum preteen pop, to my “rebellious” stage of dark feelings and thoughts and finding Nirvana playing somewhere near. It has always been the words that I could not say. When I say,”All I need is my music...” it is because they are the words that I cannot express.  	My music is my escape. 	My headphones are my walls to block off the world around me. All I see is pain, grief, and sadness around me. Between my thoughts, and everywhere you look now, on the news, in the papers, in the schools... My headphones give me a momentary loss of what is happening and just to get everything out. 	In our world of lost lives, lost thoughts, lost feelings. Everyone must have their own avoidance... 	All anyone needs is an understanding notion, just something to keep their mind away from the “evils”. 	I have found mine in music  yeah i dont know what to write today

      thinking is always interesting..    you have one specific thought in your mind...and if you let it wander...who knows what you can get yourself into...  you give off a little hint...just the tip of an iceburg as to whats running through your head...and you never can really know how someone is going to take it    the hardest thing..i really do believe..is to just put your thoughts out there... purely exposing yourself to others thoughts and words... dealing with the responsibilities, and consequences of what you may have said        lies are much easier to pull off...give someone a smile and a compliment and you can have it down... no wonder im not the american dream

      the scars are hidden invisible you think you see a giant scrape across my arm or a thin line of blood along my leg but they are deep... deep inside my head the safest place to mark them  for me its just as dangerous as a cut the first one always the smallest but then growing longer... and deeper... until no going back...  look inside my window just at the "right" time and you'll see the scars never healing.. always bleeding  the "blood" taking over until there is nothing to take over left

      Hope dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption  Winding in and winding out  The shine of it has caught my eye  And roped me in  So mesmerizing, and so hypnotizing  I am captivated,  I am...   [Chorus]  Vindicated  I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  Swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself   So clear  Like the diamond in your ring  Cut to mirror your intention  Oversized and overwhelmed  The shine of which has caught my eye  And rendered me so isolated, so motivated  I am certain now that I am...   [Chorus]   So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x]  So let me slip against the current  So let me slip away [4x]   [Chorus]   Like hope  Dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption...

      where am i? im stuck inside my head im stuck with the thoughts with the feelings everything i dont want anymore  i love the phone calls i love hearing a voice that called just for me i hate hearing the sound of no one there the thought of actually being alone scares the hell out of me  i cant actually ever take being alone or being with someone i need someone there watching me but i need them to be far enough back to not get me paranoid  i am cared for but not how i want to be cared for i am loved but too much and i dont see it  i hear the phrase "dont worry be happy", "breathe", "dance like no ones watching, sing like no one is listening, live like theres no tomorrow" all coming from this girl this young woman who is full of promise full of hope and full of said dreams  where has she gone?  shes dissapeared to a corner with her earphones and a guitar blocking the world out

      staring at the blue walls that have surrounded me for the past 6 years doesnt brng me as much peace as it use to  the bed is my hiding place, the computer is merely part of my facade the guitar is a block, so i stay by myself  i sit and think about everything being written everything being said everything i think... and it all is just bullshit now  does anyone really care? does anyone have any clue? does anyone bother to look?  because if you saw it... you would basically see someone stuck in their mind with a smile that merely is the fakest thing on the face of the earth    yeah im home

      goes by too quickly but not fast enough  its just there  its depended on by too many.... and not cared about by few  in overall thinking we hold a spec of it to ourselves but while here its everything  the end

      signifies thinking... signifies some thought going through the mind... whether it be good, evil, of indifference  can change the world... one thought could change everything imagine....  im thinking ending it there sounds like a good idea

      whoa if anyone cares.....sorry about not writing since monday no license but its probably for the best...planning the thelma and louise route  but yeah no freedom... the worst part...i dont think anyone really cared...i mean i got all the apologies and "youll do better next time"s  but they were all just sorta half-assed and i know that someof the people with their apologies do read this.....well fuck you....i dont care  i wanted it so bad...i just wanted to leave im sorry im not happy at home ? yeah ok so maybe i am....i have an amazing family... great friends and people surrounding me and supporting everything i do  but for some reason it just doesnt bring me the unconditional happiness i expect to see in a family  i hear it from my friends that they hate their own individual houses...but they love others.....and believe me i say it all the time to....  but is it really that good idea to plan certain things, plan to run away with your car.....and hide out in your room until you can?

      im here im here and listening  the things you think that go in one ear and out the other stick around they remind me of the jokes made the times i was laughed at the things that bring me down  as gone as i may act... its so you dont worry because if you actually saw me without the drunk smile...or the stoned eyes...what would you really think?  no im not the brightest person no i will never mount up to my brother, my friends....or even my younger sister... but do you have to remind me?  the falling asleep in class... the advils... merely things to make me feel like i have a reason for failing  once you see past all these lies i have created...what will you see left?

      i envy pirates i envy anyone with freedom i envy thelma and louise  the thought of being able to just go to get up and leave is the most passionate dream i have in me to go... never look back.. even with the cares in your mind... leaving...its my wish  maybe im just running from something maybe i just like the thought of someone worrying where i am, or caring where i go  but to be honest... i dont give a fuck (a hush comes over the readers...) OMG! she cussed... OMG! shes turning into such a teenager  fuck you

      What else should I be All apologies What else could I say Everyone is gay What else could I write I don't have the right What else should I be All apologies  In the sun In the sun I feel as one In the sun In the sun I'm married Buried  I wish I was like you Easily amused Find my nest of salt Everything is my fault I'll take all the blame Aqua seafoam shame Sunburn with freezeburn Choking on the ashes of her enemy  In the sun In the sun I feel as one In the sun In the sun Married, Maried, Maried! Buried! Yeah yeah yeah yeah   All in all is all we are (x20)
