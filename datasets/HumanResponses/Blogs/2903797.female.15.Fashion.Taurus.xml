      no one has commented on my blog! not cool! comment! I havnt really done much this summer, but im havign such an amazing time! it came in on me how many great friends i have...im not saying im little miss popular, im not, but the friends i do have are all great. I organized my buddy list into categories, and i realize that although i have amazing friends at school, i also have great friends out of school, and the strange thing is that only one of them is a girl. I think that everybody should organize their buddy list, cos it really made me appreciate my friends. In other news ive been hanging out in westwood more. i got into a minor fight with my mother this after noon cos she said johanna and i couldnt go into westwood at 7:30pm cos we are two young girls and could get raped. i hate that my freedom is limited just ebcause im a girl, it doesnt seem fair. i also hate beign this age, i want to drive, i want to be allowed a glass of wine at dinner on special occasions, i want to have the option of having sex without being looked down upon and called a slut, i want a baby! i want all these things that i cant have just because im 15...it doesnt seem fair, especially as i have no control over my age!!! Ugh! The worst part i think is the driving and not being allowed in westwood at night. westwood is only really fun at night, cos everyone is there! ugh anyways xoxo

      My uncle Ian is in a tribute band to fleetwood mac, theyre called rumours of fleetwood mac (cos fleetwood mac had an album called rumours...) anyways when we were moving to america we went to my uncles concert, and they sang:  "If you wake up and don't want to smile, If it takes just a little while, Open your eyes and look at the day, You'll see things in a different way.  Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow, Don't stop, it'll soon be here, It'll be, better than before, Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.  Why not think about times to come, And not about the things that you've done, If your life was bad to you, Just think what tomorrow will do.  Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow, Don't stop, it'll soon be here, It'll be, better than before, Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.  All I want is to see you smile, If it takes just a little while, I know you don't believe that it's true, I never meant any harm to you.  Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow, Don't stop, it'll soon be here, It'll be, better than before, Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.  Don't you look back, Don't you look back."   It was so strange cos we were all thinking about how we were going to miss england, and our friends, and familly, and the life we had made there, but they played that song and we all looked at each other and kinda clicked that we had to stop living in the past. I dont know why i shared any of that, i just bough fleetwood mac's the dance cd, and that song is on it, and it brought me right back lol.  I love fleetwood mac!!! i love this song aswell:  "Fleetwood Mac lyrics :: Rhiannon lyrics  Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night And wouldn't you love to love her? Takes through the sky like a bird in flight And who will be her lover? All your life you've never seen a woman Taken by the wind Would you stay if she promised you heaven? Will you ever win? She is like a cat in the dark And then she is the darkness She rules her life like a fine skylark And when the sky is starless All your life you've never seen a woman Taken by the wind Would you stay if she promised you heaven? Will you ever win? Will you ever win? Rhiannon Rhiannon Rhiannon Rhiannon She rings like a bell through the night And wouldn't you love to love her? She was alive like a bird in flight And who will be her lover? All your life you've never seen a woman Taken by the wind Would you stay if she promised you heaven? Will you ever win? Will you ever win? Rhiannon  Rhiannon Rhiannon Taken by Taken by the sky Taken by Taken by the sky Taken by Taken by the sky Dreams unwind Love's a state of mind Dreams unwind Love's a state of mind"  i love that song... My life really is marked by wich band i had an obsession with at the time. In england it was freddie Mercury, when we wer moving it was fleetwood mac, and wheetus lol, here its been all sorts of bands from no doubt, to queen, to the beatles, to rufus wainwright, to lil bow wow, the chilli peppers, and franz ferdinand. And every time i listen to a song from any of the above i get taken right back to my age, what i was feeling, the smells, the colours, its all back again. i love how music can do that. for instance, the song above, rhiannon, when i hear that, im a 7th grader in triple threat, its christmass vacation, im painting my nails and obsessing over Jonah Wieder. With Lil Bow Wow, its the summer going into 8th grade, its very bright, im very happy, and i felt really grown up for some reason. you get the picture lol. Its why music is a universal language, everyone can connect to at least one aspect of it.  xoxo

      Loving you Isn't the right thing to do How can I ever change things That I feel  If I could Maybe I'd give you my world How can I When you won't take it from me  You can go your own way Go your own way You an call it Another lonely day You can go your own way Go your own way  Tell me why Everything turned around Packing up Shacking up is all you wanna do  If I could Baby I'd give you my world Open up Everything's waiting for you You can go your own way  Go your own way You an call it Another lonely day You can go your own way go your own way  'And that, my friend, is what they call closure!' xoxo

      I just saw Donnie Darko...oh...my...God.... I saw it with Julie, shed seen it before and when it ended this song played:  All around me are familiar faces  Worn out places  Worn out faces  Bright and early for the daily races  Going no where  Going no where  Their tears are filling up their glasses  No expression  No expression  Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow  No tomorrow  No tomorrow  And I find it kind of funny  I find it kind of sad  The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had  I find it hard to tell you  I find it hard to take  When people run in circles its a very very  Mad world  Mad world  Children waiting for the day they feel good  Happy birthday  Happy birthday  And I feel the way that every child should  Sit and listen  Sit and listen  Went to school and I was very nervous  No one knew me  No one knew me  Hello teacher tell me what’s my lesson  Look right through me  Look right through me  And I find I kind of funny  I find it kind of sad  The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had  I find it hard to tell you  I find it hard to take  When people run in circles its a very very  Mad world  Mad world  Enlarging your world  Mad world   And i sat up at the credits started and could utter only one syllable...'wooaah...' and i kinda just kept saying it over and over again. Its such an amazing movie, its sooo powerful in that it makes you wanna just say 'woah' over and over again. Im listening to the song above right now and i feel so strange, its so wierd. I want to be an actress about a billion times more now... Ok im gonna go and watch it again maybe...i dont know...i dont klnow what to do with myself now!  I wanna call michael, but he's still in new york and i dont have a number. The feeling comes and goes, and then my emotions kick in where i get sooo happy. i dunno, the feeling has kinda faded away, so hopedully thats a good sign... In other news, The Chad arrives today at 11:30am, its 11:02 now...dispite myself im kinda exited, i havnt seen him in a forever. Also Jared Leto is perfectly, typically a dreamboat... As is Jake Gyllenhaal... xoxo

      ok i am a terrible girlfriend, i know i allways decide that when im dating some1, but i am so commitment phobic its terrible. its just that ive liked michael for a really really long time, and he finally asked me out...so why do i feel like i want out?? i know why, i just hate to admit it...but hes not matt.  im going to make this one work tho. however i am a little suspicious, he just asked me out randomly, maybe he wasnt completly sober, or tired, or desperate or something. Maybe thats why i feel so unsure, it was just so random. but i keep on getting waves of complete happiness...im a girlfriend! sure my boyfriend isnt the person who ideally id like it to be...but he is the next best thing, and im happy...i think. Whats wrong with me? why does it have to be that when im not in a relationship i spend forever dreaming that i was, and then wehn it finally happens i get scared. well forget it, this time im sticking with it. if he still wants to date me today and isnt having second thoughts, then im not going to break up with him. im talking to him...i am DEFINATLY not going to break up with him...hes perfect, he realyl is. well, in so far as hes not matt. xoxo

      Okay, i have discussed this with julia, but no one else. im not sure who else is affected by this, but its going to drive me insane!!! eMy mother says that her and a bunch of other mothers have desided that none of us are allowed on our computers past 11:30pm!!! nooottt cooooll! The best conversations happen in the dead of the night when every1 is exhausted and not sure what is going on! As julia said, 'do they really want us to go and get knocked up???' which naturally is the answer...if im not online past 11:30 than what can i do besides have sex and end up knocked up??? lol thats why we love julia :-D   I would just like to say SORRY if i upset anybody this vacation, i can only think of one person, but if there r more im sorry to them aswell.   i dunno where that came from  anyways back to the internet...my mother gioes to bed at like 9 or 10, so how is shwe gonna make me sign off??? people who are affected (and i know it is alot of people) we need to boycott our famillies! WHO ARE THEY TO DECIDE WHEN WE DO OR WHEN WE DONT TALK TO OUR FRIENDS??? i say that if this comes into play, instead of talking online, we all call each other!!! ok gotta go xoxo muah

      So I have every episode of friends ever made.  Today i woke up at 12, and prompt at 2 sat down on the fouton and have been watching friends ever sinse, its been about 7 and a half hours now. at 7pm my parents went out to dinner again leaving me at home, fine w/e, at least james was home. at about 8 i went down to ask james if he wanted to watch friends with me, but i couldnt find him so i called him and he was in a movie. so i got upset and decided to walk down to ralphs to get some cookie dough and a bottle of sprite. as i have no money i raided the house and found about $7 in quaters. Walking to raplhs it was getting dark. i got what i needed, started to walk home and realized it was really dark. so as im waiting for the light to change so i can cross the street a guy, not bad looking at all, comes up to me and says hey so i say hey and he goes 'sure is pretty out tonight huh' so i said 'yea is nice' and he said 'course, not at pretty as you.' so i smiled and the light changed thank god. So i got home and nobody was rthere still so i opened the cookie dough log , and the sprite and watched freinds some more. thats when i started to cry. for 2 reasons. number one was i was so fucking sick of being home alone, and the other was i realized howe much my current situation with my love life...i doubt u dont know what im talking  about...mirrors the early sitation with ross and racheal, for insance, he liked her for a year, she started to like him but he had found somebody else and then he had to choose between...im just hoping that my situation ends as happily as theirs did. anyways i decided to call julia, but she is out with jeff (ive gotta sauy that didnt help, i meamn i know they rnt dating, but its like every1 has somebody. ross and racheal (ok i wont get into that) for example.) anyways, so now im listening to 'im in a sad mood' by sam cooke, it fits considering he gave me the sam cooke cd and the title closely matches my mood. i hear they are doing grand, and im happy for him...just not for me lol. xoxo

      I'M KATE AGAIN!!11! WOOP WOOP! I am having the most amazing summer, for the first 5 days i did nothing but wake uop at 12, lie on a sofa, watch father ted, go to bed at 12, wake up at 12, and so the cycle continued. But then yesterday I saw Julie who i javnt seen in forever and that was really nice because I love Julie. And then i hung out with some friends during he night. The thing is tho that I got to bed at 4am and my mother called at 9.25am to say james was on his way to pick me up, so im on live 5 hours of sleep and i cnt go back to bed because some guy is here doing something with the house so we can stay in america or something. I got a hobby! I cnt say what it is tho cos im not allowed lol. ok so. off i go to take a shower, get in pj's and watch father ted or hobby or do something that involves nothing very strenuous...o and im making more coffee...lots more coffee. au revoir!!! xoxo

      i am sooo happy its summeerrr! im back to being kate again but im too fecking lazy to change my name on blogger back to kate the great so i'll be weeping willow on blogger for a little time now.  So for my mums birthday my brother got her the complete 'holy trilogy' of father etd, an amazing british comedy about 3 irish priests living on this island in a parish. it sounds like shit when u describe it, but its hilarious. anyways i grew up with father ted and ive done nothing but watch it for the past 3 days...my away messages hint at such a thing. anyways i developed a huge crush for ardal o'hanlon who plays dougel on the show (see my away messages) and so i told my mum who drops the bomb, here how the convo went: Me: God mum, ive developed the biggest crush on Ardal O'Hanlon Mum: He is lovely, but then again he is your 3rd cousin, so don't get to attached. Me: Feck! What are you talking about??? Mum: I told you that, hes my mothers sisters son. Me: Feck! I cant have a crush on my cousin!!!!! Mum: well hes your 3rd cousin, so its not that bad.  Yea, so my latest obsession is my 3rd cousin...mind you i do also have a crush on another 3rd cousin and actually one 1st cousin, but thats a diferent story. anyways, i doubt any of you have heard of the wonderful ardal o'hanlon, hes a stand up comediest primarily, but hes been in a load of british shows like My Hero. Next July me and my family are all off to Ireland for like 6 weeks and I may get to meet him! he lives in Dublin and London, and we r going to both places I believe (my other cousin has a house in dublin aswell as where she usually lives and we will be stopping at england to see people) So i'm on top of the moon! its so wierd watching him on the tely knowing that hes my relative, it changes things lol. xoxo

      You know what is great about summer? i dont have to see people that i dont want to for 3 months. i choose not to see alot of people right now. ansd to be honest i am really pissed off, upset, hurt and feel like getting completely wasted and out of my head. i wont tho but i will just give a nice big FUCK YOU! to someone who i thought was my friend, but i now realise that friendship was more like an owner and pet kind of a think, guess which one i was...the pet.

Tina:   well, it could be fun   me:  EXACTLY!!!   mum:  Tina, kate knows that i am the best mother in the world-   me:  and the most modest-sorry, continue   mum:  i dont need to be modest! i am fantastic!   tina:  shes right you know, she is amazing   mum:  thank you, dou like my jacket?   me:  DONT CHANGE THE SUBJECT!   mum:  anyways, she only wants to do the pageant so that she can rebel against me.   me:  dont flatter urself, i may actually just want to do it cos it could be fun! its not all about you!   mum:  ahem! whos the birthday girl? Tina I got this coat at...   Tina:  lets get sloshed!~  so i reached for the dessert wine, looks like i wont be pageanting this year after all..o well :) xoxo

      Our friends from Cardiff (which is in wales) (which is in the UK) (its in the south westish area) (go get a map) (anyways...) just left. im so sad! I dunno who I miss the most! The cute little 3 year old (amy)? the adorable 1 year old (adam)? their mother (danielle)? her sister (tracy)? her boyfriend (simon)? their father Barry)? or the little ones father (Gareth)! lord hes good looking! here is a pic: http://www.welshrugbypics.co.uk/events/030825dragonsvquins/source/030825dragonsvquins07.php  He's 32 and hes so funny and nice and polite and an amazing husband and father and lord hes perfect! why are the perfect ones allways old, married engaged, or gay??? Amy the 3 year old coloured in a picutre of Roly Mo for me, and adam (the 1 year old) coloured an octopus. And every1 gave me a $30 best buy gift certificate!!! Whats really cool is that whern i was like 1 and james was about 5 we went to hong kong to visit them all and Danielle (wo was about my age now, maybe a little older im not sure) baby sat me and james, and now im baby sitting her kids! its so wierd!~ its like me looking at amy and thinking 'one day this 3 year old is going to be looking after my 3 year old!' aah! its so freaky! I really want a baby now! it feels so right holding adam! hes sooo cute! they are both the ideal chuildren. knowing my luck tho id get the child from hell. it was my mums bday last night and i told one of her friends that i want a baby and she said 'well we will have to find you a husband then!' and i think she was to some extent serious! so shes going to set me up with all these potential husbands lol Babies bring me on to my next point... Ive been talking to alot of people about sex (not in a sick way u pervert!) and it seems that alot of people wanna have sex! 2 come to mind but i wont mention them. its sick!i mean i want a baby but right now id rather have the pain of child birth without the pleasure! or i'll adopt! but the thought of havign sex right now really grosses me out! What should i get from best buy? xoxo

      I havnt blogged in a few days, for a few reasons. 1 is nothing much has happened, another is ive been studying for finals and the last one is ive been baby sitting, so there really hasnt been much time. I have time now because i have finished studying for my biology final, and our visitors went to the ebach and so we r waiting for them to get home so we can have a bbq. They were supposed to be back 44 minutes ago.  Tofay was so relaxing, besides the part where my alarm went off at 9am and i studied. after studying i sat in a rubber ring in my pool and finished macbeth, then i lay down on a lilo in my pool and fell asleep listening to music, it was wonderful :)  I went to a graduation party last night for my brothers friend Nate, billy kaplan and evan alpaugh were there, it was fun, we talked, not like deep conversations, but we did talk. My life is so boring right now, i wish something exiting would happen like getting picked for a movie while i was walking down the street or something. im not gonna do miss.california because the time limit ran out. it ran out because everytime i asked my mother if we could talk about it she said 'later' or 'tomorrow' or she walked away. she claims to have not done that purposfully but i think her grand plan was to put off talking about it until it was too late, and her ruse worked. im soooooo...lacking in anything engaging to do. im gonna go read blogs, bye bye for now, :-D xoxo

      in about half an hour my house will be flooded by all ages with british accents. 3 generations of friends from england will be taking over my house for about a week. there is my parents friend barry, his daughters and their husbands, and their children. the funny thing is that barrys kids used to baby sit me, and now im going to baby sit thier kids...frreeaakkkyyy! today was the last day of school besides finals. it feels so wierd. i honestly feel like lasat week i was still figuring out where the classrooms were. it seems like only a few days ago that we became freshmen, and now, in 3 months, we will be sophmores. saturday is graduation. monday is my mums birthday. last year my brother graduated on my mums bday and my dad gave the commencment speech, i am having serious problems coming to terms with that being a year ago on monday. its just all so strange! so much has happened in the past year, and yet nothing has. i cant seem to get my head around anything!!! o well, thats life, right? xoxo

      wow last night wasnt fun, but today was! i cant actually remember what happened, maybe it was thatme and julia had to do a dance project during activities and ms.lavin had given us some1 elses project to borrow so we couldf get ideas and then julia put their project in her backpack and it got all ripped so me and jules had to run to the library to do our project and redo the other people's. maybe it was lunch time, or maybe it was that i was too tired to focus on anything and so everything seemed 10 tiems funnier lol. after school i had to get my passport and green card photos taken. the passport one was horrid as allways because i couldnt put my hair infront of my ears cos it looks terrible so i put it behind my ears and altho it made my hair longer, it made my ears bigger...adn they alreayd r huge so it wasnt great. and then the green card ones they need to see all of your right ear and my nose from the side is HUMUNGO! so yea, they didnt show up too well lol.  yea... xoxo

      My dad found my blog, and altho he said he wouldnt look at it again and i trust him, u can ever be too safe. i wanna use my blog to make posts adult free! lets start off:  I'm about to publicly announce something id never even tell myself usually. if you know me well, then you will know this is a huge change and step for me. im in love. i wont say who with, a assume most of you know, but as im not putting a name uop here id appreciate you didnt tell any1.  i guess the song that most describes me now is 'ever fallen in love' by pete yorn. "You spurn my natural emotions You make me feel like dirt And I’m hurt And if I start a commotion I run the risk of losing you And that’s worse  Ever fallen in love with someone Ever fallen in love In love with someone Ever fallen in love In love with someone You shouldn’t’ve fallen in love with  I can’t see much of a future Unless we find out what’s to blame What a shame And we won’t be together much longer Unless we realize that we are the same  Ever fallen in love with someone Ever fallen in love In love with someone Ever fallen in love In love with someone You shouldn’t’ve fallen in love with  You disturb my natural emotions You make me feel like dirt And I’m hurt And if I start a commotion I’ll only end up losing you And that’s worse  Ever fallen in love with someone Ever fallen in love In love with someone Ever fallen in love In love with someone You shouldn’t’ve fallen in love with  Ever fallen in love with someone Ever fallen in love In love with someone Ever fallen in love In love with someone You shouldn’t’ve fallen in love with Fallen in love with Ever fallen in love with someone You shouldn’t’ve fallen in love with"  xoxo  2 quotes that decribe my mood:  IF you really love me like you say you do, you'll put no one above me, the way I do with you!  as i lay here in my bed i will never forget the way you hugged me the way you loved me, the things you'll never do again.

       I just got back from yoga with julia. omg. there were 40 people there and no air conditioning, the windows steamed up, everybody was sweating and when we left the floor was drenched. it was sooo tiring, but it felt so good at the end. infact it was wroth it to step outside and see 4 unbelievably hot guys sweaty and topless ;)

I really wanna try kickboxing, so if anybody wants to do that with me...call!!! What else is there to write about? not too much im afraid. Ugh my mother just read over my shoulder...this is why we have our own bedrooms, because people have to knock and then when they do we have time to hide our blogs!! thank god i didnt write anything private. for some reason my mum takes offense if i say im bored, she gets all concered...oy lol. when mr.window cleaner leaves my bedroom im going to not renivate my bedroom, but im going to sort it out. I actually love my bedroom, its so...pink :) its big aswell...one of a few perks of james moving out lol. i really dont have anything to write about...uuuuuuughhhhh i really wanna get into my room! i miss it! i have with drawl! what if he lifts up my curtains and fins my secret cave behind my bed! what if he looks thru it and finds the secrets and the wonders within??? ahhhh! im sure he wouldnt tho...thats an invasion of privacy and as he doesnt have a warrent or my permission he cant...right? Im just going to keep on rambling. i realized there was no point in taking driving school just yet anyways cos im not 15 and a half for another 4 months. my stomach hurts cos im sitting on the most uncomfortable chair ever.&nbsp; oooooooowwwwwww. my cousins arrive on thursday!!!! im so exited! i love my cousins and i&nbsp;never get to see them! wow ive managed to ramble on about nothing for a long time...o well, bye bye! xoxo &nbsp;

      So here is what I have decided: No matter what I do, somebody is always going to have a problem with it, someone is always going to correct my spelling, my grammer, someone is always going to lecture me, its never going to be enough, someone will always want more. To be honest I'm sick of people judging what I'm wearing, what i said, what i did, how i feel etc. Im so sick of it that this is my message to society: IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME, THATS FINE! I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO! IF MY SHIRT DOESNT MATCH MY SKIRT AND I DIDNT ASK YOU IF IT DID, DEAL WITH IT! IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT I'M DOING BUT IT DOESNT DIRECTLY AFFECT YOU,&nbsp;LIVE WITH IT! THIS IS WHO I AM, THIS IS WHAT I LIKE, AND I NEVER ASKED YOU TO AGREE WITH THAT! YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT ME, JUST RESPECT ME!!!!!!!! Thank you. Ive just gotten to the point where i feel like, if what i do damages me, im going to pay in the long run, i appreciate your concern if you have any, but don't become my 4th or 5th parent, i dont need that. xoxo

      Yea well I'm back lol.  OMG i had the best night last night! I went to the modest mouse concert with Julia. ONe thing that was awesome is that I had never been to a club and a concert by myself...exept the roxy, before, and although we were the youngest people there and one woman turned to us and goes 'babies!' lol i had so much fun!. I won't get into too many details, but it was great just to dance and not care what I looked like cos I didnt know anyone there. I had a totally awesome night back at Julias house aswell lol, despite the drama. Jules and I had a great talk before we fell asleep...actually 2 and a half hours after we were supposed to be asleep we decided to go and get food, so that whole 'be in bed at 1am and no later!!!' thing really didnt work lol. It was just a very successful night...and now its 8:45am, and Im about to pass out from tiredness lol.  xoxo

      Okay I really dont want to blog anymore, tomorrow im sure i'll forget all about this entry and start blogging again, but for right now im kind of sick of it....its so unpersonal, most people use the comments to talk about themselves instead of responding, and no one really cares about any of the shit im writing about. so for a little while at least im going to stick with my diary. like i said tomorrow i may be back on the blogging. maybe im just pissed off at everyone right now, for reasons id like to keep private, not that any of you care because judging from my comments no one has read my blog in days, whatever.

      I have the attention span of a fish. My parents take these Omega something pills wich are supposed to imporve your memory, and they are justbasically fish oil...logically you'd believe that fish have incredible memories and attention spans, but they dont...only 2 seconds, and thats what i have. Ive been trying to tidy my room sinse about this time yesterday, and somehow or another i allways end up sitting at my computer...why is this? ive made considerable progress today, but here i am, blogging instead of tidying, ugh id better get back to it :-/ wish me luck!!!!!!! xoxo

      You know i dont actually know why im blogging lol. I domnt have anything on my mind...or anything id like to publish anyways. DOnt forget to read my post directy below this one. I doubt i'll publish this, u will know if i hve though...cos you wontbe reading this if i dont. I just wrote realy long entry in my diary...i wish i could share it with someone, i may later, but there are 3 people who would be very very very upset with what im feeling...it probably isnt you if u r reading this. I feel like I have a confession to make before i can move on with what i feel is becoming a new me. I never really liked led zeppelin. i really didnt, that is until this weekend. on the 6 hour car ride home yesterday, it was dark, everybody, david, spencer, garrett and katie grogan were all asleep, and mrs.bray was driving the car, so we werent talking. i think it was about 10:30, and led zeppelin was playing, led zeppelin IV i believe. For the first time ever i really liked it, it may have been to do with my mood. the car rides there and back were very very long, but the hours went by so slowly and peacefully for some reason. i had a lot of time to thing, to debate my beliefs, what i strongly believ to be right, what i want to prevent, and what has already happened that isnt fair. one thing isnt fair, and thats that i allways want what i cant have, this has nothing to do with matt, this is to do with another guy, i dont think any of you will guess who it is, and im in not wrong mind to tell you, that would be a mistake. but i think that because this guy is so restricted, by 3 people, those people mentioned above. 2 of them have made it very very very clear their stand point on this guy and me, and one of them ive never met, but im pretty sure she wouldnt like it much at all. i just feel like all these restrictions, they arent fair, but if there werent such restrictions on this guy i wouldnt like him. its the danger factor that i love. What i realize on the car ride back was I loe a bad boy, one who im really not allowed to like or date, or touch. i also like a guy who is mean to me at first and then becomes really nice, because then i have no expectations and its such a shock that the ground comes from under my feet and i fall into his spell lol. ok enough of these ramblings, i have to go and bbq, like i said i dont know if i will publish this, i may have said too much, plus i dont know what ui wrote, im too lazy to proof read. xoxo

      Its quite incredible, it appears that the power of music has a greater affect on me than the power of love does. its the battle of the powers lol. So i was upset, very upset about the feeling, i listened to some 'hopelessly devoted' from grease and 'too much love will kill you' by queen, then i thought 'fuck it, so i have the feeling, its not the end of the world, im not looking to marry this guy, infact im not even sure if im ready for a commitment of any kind just yet! so why am i all bummed out about this? what would come of anything if things stayed the same???' so i put on rock n roll my led zeppelin and suddenly all my blues were humming a diferent tune! xoxo Rock And Roll  (Bonham/Jones/Page/Plant)   It's been a long time since I rock and rolled,  It's been a long time since I did the Stroll.  Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back,  Let me get it back, baby, where I come from.  It's been a long time, been a long time,  Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time. Yes it has.   It's been a long time since the book of love,  I can't count the tears of a life with no love.  Carry me back, carry me back,  Carry me back, baby, where I come from.  It's been a long time, been a long time,  Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.   Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight,  Making vows that just can't work right.  Open your arms, opens your arms,  Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in.  It's been a long time, been a long time,  Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

      o...holy...shit... I have the feeling, and the feeling has never been wrong. The one person, in my entire life, who has so cruely rip;ped me of my heart and pride and esteem, has moved on. He hasnt said anything, but the feeling, i have the dreaded, god awful, forsaken feeling that ive had so many other times before...the self same feeling the clued me in on conrad, john creasy, and michael. The same feeling that has never been wrong in all the years its wispered in my ear. Why should it be that every time i talk to this person, this person that you all know, i start to cry. I know why, because he doesnt still get those butterflys that i get, and i dont think that he looks in anticipation to see if ive responded as i do with him. im so sick of my love life! my fuckign phsyci was right!im in dire love trouble, and i feel like jumping off a bridge. i feel like drving back to shaver, jumping on a wake board and falling straight over the dam.  I hate that one person can make me feel this, i dotn get how one person can have so much control over me. i feel dead.

      Well I just got back. I had a fever two nights and spent the entire time coughing my primary organs up. and im sun burnt. and you know what? looking back on the entire trip, i dont notice those 3 things at all! i had the most fun ive had in a very long time!!!!!!! I didnt even feel sick, i just looked and sounded it lol. I went with spencer and david schlecer, but kimmy black and her familly were up there aswell. garrett and katie grogan were also there aswell at robert bray and his college friends -  armen, john caldwell, aj, joey power, patrick, steve, johns girlfriend, ajs girlfriend and joeys girlfriend.  Ive never really done any water sports before and garrett said hed teach me to wake board but we didnt get rou8nd to it, hopefully i'll be invited up asgain so i can try it lol. but i did get to extreme inner tubing. im sure u all know what inner tubing is, but just in case uits where ur on a floaty thing attached to a rope like cable wich is attached to the back of a speed boat wich hurtles around the lake at top speed lol. but the way the brays play it is there r two inner tubes and two peeps on each and each team tries to throw the other team off thier tube. One time we did it one on one and i couldnt be gotten off, not because im so skilled at it, (actually i never touched another persons tuber cos i was terrified), but because i was so determined not to rbeak my back on the water, lol. but garrett was determined to get me off so he did the circle of death pretty fast, and david fell of before i did :-D  anyways i had soo much fun and im kind of sad to be back, lol. talk to you all soon no doubt! xoxo 'best you check out the boy. you'll get a kick out of it, i promise you that, you'll get a kick out of it.'

      So i'm going up to shaver lake today...i think. it all depends on my wavering health. sinse wednesday ive been coughing, we think its allergies, my brother thinks otherwise, but i wont get into that. Anyways no we r pretty sure that my asthma has revived itself because mum hadnt changed the filter for the ac and it was shooting out dust wich im allergic to. Anyways ive been disappointed and then exited and all these emotiomns cos every 5 seconds my parents change their mind as to whether i can go or not. I really really really really really really really really really really really really  really really really really  really really really really really really really really  really really really really  really really really really really really really really  really really really really  really really really really really really really really reeaaalllyyy wanna go! but at the same time i dont want to infect everyone or spendthe entire weekend in bed bringing every1 elses time down...ugh its sooo annoying, every time i get exited for something i get sick. like in england in like 1s grade, every year at arnold lodge there was a nativity play and i was allways an angel and i got sooo sick of it! until one year they picked me to be mary!!!! i was sooo exited, espcially as i had a crush on the person playing joseph, anyways the night of the show i developed the flu and couldnt perform. i sat at home watchiong postman pat, wich uve never heard of. anyways, i refuse to have a repeat of mary, i will be fine, i will be fine, i will be fine, i will be fine. anyways if i do end up going, i wont be blogging till i get back on sunay, so hopefully see you then!!!!

      OOO just another thing i thought of... i feel like everyone feels like they need to find themselves and to 'be and original' its almost like that is the cool thing to do. everyone seems to think that to be yourself you have to avoid the trends and not be mainstream, but what if wearing layers and shot skirts is who you arE? what if you arents just so self concious that you have to fit in? it seems like most people judge people who wear the latest thigns and listen to the latest music and is allways at the new movies etc, but did it ever occur to anyone that that is who these people are? they like the mainstream things??

      I read Julia's post about being a 'little girl in a grown up world' and i know what she means. it seems like the entire world is rushing by, and i'm being pulled along with it. there are times where i just feel so alone and that everyone is moving much faster, or slower than i am, that no one realy understands what i want, and what im feeling. im one person with my familly, another with my friends at brentwood, another with my friends from out side of school. But what ive been concluding from reading everyone elses blogs is rthat everybody else is feeling the same way. I was shopping this morning, and i saw a jacket wich i thought was sooo cute, but i looked at it and i knew that if i showed it to julie, shed say she didnt like it. and i walked past it because i didnt want to own something that someone else didnt like. butn then i went back and i tried it on, and i realized, and it was hrd, but i did, that i wasnt asking julie to like it, or to wear it, or to even look at it, if i liked it, then what was to stop me from getting it??? My parents wont let me do certain tings because they say im too young, and i realize that they are my parents and they love me and they dont want me to get in with a fast crowd and do things i dont want to do, but what they dont understand is that im not going to do something i dotn want to. ive been force fed 'peer pressure' and 'just say no' sinse as long as i can remember, and it actually went in, if my friends form out of school were to pressure me to try something that i wasnt comfotable with doing, i wouldnt, id say no, and if they made fun of me then id be upset, but if i honestly wasnt comfortable doing it then i wouldnmt, i think id realize that these people werent good friends. but what my parents also dont seem to comprehemnd is that none of my friends, in or out of school try and make me do things i dont want to, ive never been pressdured to do drugs or drink or anything. i think that most people seem to feel like they either have to be 'fast' or prude, there doesnt seem to be a happy medium, but what i love about the friends that i have now is that i'm willing to do somethings, but not others and thats fine with everybody. when i was on the beach last week john asked me if i wanted a clove, or clover or something, and as id never heard of one i said i didnt, and he said okay, it wasnt a problem. i realize that peer pressure is out there, but as ive never been subjected to it, right now i feel like its something that has been put up too much in movies...maybe im the only person who feels like they dont have to do drugs or drink to fit in, i think its a personal choice. i have no clue what ive just rambled on about, i cant be bothered to re-read it...o well lol xoxo

      I'm so exited! im going to shaver lake on friday!!!!! wooop! The only problem is that i miss john's party, and the most talented, attractive, nice, funny, absolutly fabulous, Trevor hall's concert. Its his last concert before he goes on tour with Steel Pulse...im not sure who they are, but they sound cool to be totally shallow lol.  Im going to kill my mother is she doesnt start turning the sc down at night, every morning i wake up with a cough and its killing me i swear...well not literally, but w.e.  Im so exited for shaver lake tho!!! its gonna be so much fun!!!!!!!!!  i feel like i should be writing more, but my life is so uneventful id biore you all to tears if i wrote everything down. In other news i have a choice of books to read, helpeme out, wehat should i read?? Roald Dahl's 'my uncle oswald' Roald Dahl's 'switch bitch' Roald Dahl's 'Someone like you' Truman Capote's 'Breakfast at Tiffany's Mark Twain's 'Joan of Arc'  The roald dahl books arent the kid charlie and the chocolate factory type of books, theyre the ones he wrote for adults...i didnt know he did that until i tried to read 'switch bitch' when i was 7...it didnt occur to me that 'bitch' would be in the title of a children's novel  ok well the poles are open, tell me what i should read! xoxo  ''i fought hard in the second world war' You hear them shout No good bragging about the afrika korps It was beadle's about  They dressed you up and took you off to world war one Armed you and surrounded you with wire Sat in stinking mud you sung your stupid songs And waited till they told you when to fire  Cause the rulers always laugh At a video bloodbath Nothing makes them laugh Like a video bloodbath  From the first world war to the yom-kippur It was beadle's about The bayonets slice, the rockets roar And he jumps out  Fond memories of the bloody bridge you failed to hold Many of your buddies killed or maimed You would've shot at rabbits if that's what you'd been told Till the general said 'i'm sorry you've been framed'  Cause the rulers always laugh At a video bloodbath And nothing gets a laugh Like a video bloodbath  Chorus: Keep those entries coming Leave those cameras running Keep those entrails coming Leave those soldiers gunning Because you're sure to get a laugh With a video bloodbath Nothing gets a laugh Like a video bloodbath  Here's a wacky video we got last week A bomb catches arthur unawares He's lost both his arms and he can't see or speak But thank you for the memory you shared  Cause the rulers always laugh At a video bloodbath And nothing gets a laugh Like a video bloodbath''

      I just read joey's blog, and she is definatly right about the commenting thing. Personally i wouldnt blog if i didnt want to you read what im thinking, and then respond to it.  In other news, ive been thinking alot about the relationships between girls. when a girl (girl a)enters a room and there r other girls (gilrs b) in the room, the first thing that girls b will do is look girl a up and down,and then either giggle, or glare. Its the worst feeling, as if we rnt all self conscious enough, lets gang up on each other and make every1 feel awful. I really think that girls should stick together against guys. that would be ideal, but it is never going to happen. im so intimidated by other girls! which is why at this age i feel more comfortable around guys cos if they look u up and down, its sometimes a good thing lol. My mum seperates all women out into 2 categories: Women's women, these females see other girls as potential friends, and men's women: men's women see other women as competition instead of protential friends. i would hate it if one day i realized i was a man's woman. I also hate when girls 'call guys' not like telephones them, but when 2 or more girls are waking down the street and they see a hot guy or 2 or 3 or w/e lol, they go 'ok this ones mine and that ones yours' and if you dont like the guy uve just been assigned too then she gets all mad. i do it too and it pisses me off so im going to try and stop. i feel like it should be 'ok uve identified which one u prefere, but if we ever do talk to these guys i think its up to them who they like'. I dont think its fair that girls can decide who dates who and things, and they can! like if a guy likes a girl, and the girl likes the guy, but the girls friend ikes the guy then the girl cant date the guy because her friend wont let her! it isnt fair! its hard to see ur close friend with the guy you like, but shouldnt a good friend want her friend to be happy??? Ive just been thinking recently how annoying girls are with guys.   xoxo  And when we kiss she knows it's you i kiss 'cause when we kiss i always start to cry You just can't cover up these lying lips When i die i hope it's you i'm beside To die with her would be a worthless lie To die with her would be a worthless die To die together would be worth a try To die together would be worth a try

      If you do take that risk you're considering, what's the worst that could happen? Rejection? Embarrassment? Failure? If you think things through, you may find that the worst possible outcome isn't as awful as it appears.   Thats my horoscope for today. hmmm what risk could this be? i know! but u see if i did take that big step then the outcome could be worse, i could lose a friend i could end up in a no win situation, it just wouldnt work!!!!

      I cant understand how one person can make me hate him while i love him. i dont mean im in love with this guy, that would go against me being me. when i see his screen name im in such a hurry to im him, it doesnt make a diference that i know i'll be depressed by the time our convo ends. and it doesnt matter how i know that i'll be counting the minutes before he answers each of my ims while i answer within 2 minutes of seeing his box flash orange! ugh! i just wish that i would get over him! hes over me! he hasnt said that but my scary ability to tell has rung my bell! its just so upsetting! i im him even tho i know he will have to go first, even if i say i have to go i know i'll just keep on chatting as long as i can! its just so fucking frustrating! I wish i had the courage to tell him how i still feel. i wish that i could bring up just once that i dont get thru a day without thinking of him or that every time i sign on i get disappointed that he isnt online. ugh! xoxo

      My cousins left at 7:30am today...ive stopped crying but i have this huge heavy feeling, i miss them so much. we had such a good time...they are the most awesome people that i know...and whats cooler is they are familly! They really are like my sisters...exept i only see them once a year. next summer is going to be incredible! im going to ireland with my familly for 2 weeks and then they go home and i stay on for another week or so. i wont go into details of all of our plans (we already figured everything out lol) but it looks to be a big drunken blur lol. and then fiona and Aoifa come back with me for about 2 weeks and we party it up la style....its enough to keep me going thru the year! Its so wierd, they talk about how much they hate ireland...i love it, its so comforting.   Besides all that im starting to get depressed because i keep on seeing all these back to school commercials...im not ready to go back to school! we only have like a month left!! i really cant be bothered with 10th grade! ugh!!!! this summer has been going by sooooo fast! its kind of creepy! toodles xoxo
