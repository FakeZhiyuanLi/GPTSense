      i know im gullable, here i thought my ex-husband was grown up now, but now i can see it was just a moment of "lets use tracy" since there was  nobody else to talk to. and tawni is just soooo gullable even more than me!! so i know she will go vist him and just think that everything there is just soo cool!! just watch my luck she will want to live in cal with tasha. that will be just my luck! that will drive me crazy. i know he wont help her out at all and she dont know to reconize enough when sombody isnt acting right to not be around them.  i really cant handle tawni living very far away from me. she has lots of problems learning stuffs like i do. but i think she is even slower than i am. i just need tawni to stay here in town for a few years living on her own untill i feel she can move away or travel with tasha. since thats what they wanna do. well the girls are supposed to be ready to take the drivers test this week. so maybe they can and pass. some how i dont think tawni is gonna be able to pass. i cheated when i had to take the written part, it was hard for me. and tawni wont be able to get that opportunity.lol oh well its almost time to get moving. today is monday that means appts!! up the wazoo haha no not really just one. but its every monday

      it seems just when i give up on dave thats when he decides to get in the game. he finaly tells me how we are not gonna lose the house which was nice to hear for once. he used to always tell me how its not gonna happen but he wouldnt tell me how it wasnt gonna happen so i get stressed!! but now im stressed cus of course he wants me to do all the talking. which wont go over well i can just bet. its not my plan and i dont think quick on my feet, its always after the fact that i think of stuff.    so he saved himself for a bit longer, he earned his keep for a bit more you might say. it makes me feel better that i know im not the only one thinkin about all this stuff.

      Well just as i suspected! i have the night off and of course dave has to get in his dead fuck! i dont participate at all and he thinks he deserves a piece. he wakes me up at 5am and thinks thats the time to get some before work! so he rubs me, squezzes me, prods me, masages me, kisses my back, you name it everything to turn him on but not  a dam thing for me.when will he realize that he needs to touch me other than when he wants sex! i dont think it will ever happen. thats what makes me think that even more that when the kids are all grown that thats when we will seperate. everything he was doing he was doing for himself not for me. he was stoking his own turn ons not mine. and of course just when hes ready to blow he stops, why? cus he wants this feeling to last!!! and i have to sit there and take it. like its my job or somthing to be his personal hole that needs proding. i dont know why im complaining i mean i knew it was gonna happen, i just wasnt sure when, i thought for sure it was gonna happen last night when we went to bed. thats when he usualy thinks he deserves them. he will wake me up when ever he feels like it,i could be dog tired needing tons of sleep and if the notion strikes then its go find tracy and prod her. i hate my life. i wish i had the power to do somthing about it. i cant leave him cus i wont make it on my own with 4 kids and now im held into this house thing, if i kick him out then i wont be able to make the morgage and neither can he. but i dont wanna lose this house. and its gonna happen no matter anyways. and i hate him for that. as much as i have always wanted my own house i knew it wasnt in my reach, and dave pushed it and said yes we are gonna get it and here we are in our own house, and now a year and a half later we are sooo sinking its not even funny. we always seem to find away around things or find a way to squeek by, but im thinking this time we are out of freebies. plain and simple im gonna lose my house, raise kids that are never gonna be worth anything or make anything of themselfs like they could, and my realionship isnt gonna ever go right, so ill have to give up on men, hahha but not like my daughter has who i think  no mater how much i try i dont think she is not gonna be gay when she grows up i think she isnt gonnna find a guy she likes, she always has nice guys but she dont like any of them long enough to keep them, so she is either gonna find a realy bad guy that i totaly wont like or she wil be gay!! yeah i cant wait. ohhh and dont forget she is gonna go to california and see her dad and of course think he is the best thing there is and im just a smuck! well its friday and i have off again tonight and just like i told you i bet he will go  out with out me. i am soo fat and unattractive i hate it, i wish i could just blink my eyes and get out of this whole life i have messed up

      well i think im feeling better today, but only cus i got some sleep in and dave didnt try get a peice of "unconscience sex" why guys think they can get away with that is beyond me! but with me and dave it might as well be unconscience only cus i dont participate. he gets a hard dick and the next thing you know he thinks he has every right to put it in me! and no just dont do the trick. then he just thinks i just need some turning on, which in his book means rub my crotch! cus you know thats all i am is a whole on two legs. as it is i stopped wearing underwear to bed for the sex reason only!!! i was having more sex with underwear on than i was off!     yes my sex life is sooooo in the tolet. i guess it has alot to do with how he treats me , but i dont think im all that desirable to want to sleep with either. when he was gone for 4 yrs in prison i lost 45lbs. and i did it while talking to alot of guys on the internet who made me feel great!! i mean i know that with a guy all he has to do is know there is a female on the other end of the computer and he is all good. but just them guys on a REGULAR basis would tell me how they wanted me. and i didnt have to do anything to get that! and they couldnt touch me which was sooo a plus! dave thinks he can touch me in anyway at anytime. he is in no way a gentelmen. not that he dont know  how to be one. i mean if i was a drop dead looking blonde bomb shell im sure i would have a gentelmen at my feet. but im not that and so i dont. i dont blame him i guess, i wouldnt want to be with me either.      plus i guess you could say im a jack of all trades and master of none. i know alot of little things about alot of stuff. but i havnt mastered a dam thing. i do artwork but i cant make any money at it. i can sing but i wont make any money off of that either. i love to work with dogs, but i dont raise champions and i dont show. i have 4 kids and im a really shitty mom. ive been married once and now im just not desirable to be married again , me and dave have been together for 15yrs and nope we arnt married. but right now im not ready to marry him anyways cus i dont think thats somthing that we should do, i think we are together to just raise the kids and then we are done.     so as you can see i cant seem to nuttin right. the last job i had i at least made 10.00 and hour , but i had a big head thought i could change things so i got fired. and now im only making 8.00. how does that suck. you know i was thinking, if dave dont tell me where he gets his money from maybe i should start hooking and then i dont have to tell him where i got my money from.i cant get a second job , i know i wont be able to do it. unless it was sooo part time or somthing.     i need to be able to make some dam money!! and i dont know what to do , that wont interferer with this job.i work soo many extra hours and all dave can do is complain about me still here all the time or how lynn is a bad boss, well i dont really care, cus its her being somplace else or her neededing me to help her catch up on things is money goin into my pocket so i wish he would just drop it, im doing what i can to make more money and right now the only thing i can do is to get over time, i keep pushing dave to do somthing all the dam time but he now has a second job but its only 1 day a week and it has been cancled gonna be 3 times now.so thats only gonna be 1 day on his paycheck. ooohhh wow really a second income.   i wish i could get somthing i could handle. but dave dont understand, i dont have the body to do anything phsyical nor do i have the smarts to do somthing that dont need the physicalness.      dave is happy that there is only 2 more days left of this drivers ed thing. then thats no more running to green bay, for class. well i just told him tonight that i have off on thurs and friday, so now he knows ahead of time, i bet he still dont ask me to go out with him on friday. pretty dam sad when i have to hope he will ask me to go out with him huh, that he wouldnt think to ask me to go. ill just stay at home with my kids or he will too and then when i go to work on sat he will use that night to go out with out me. im a good time when he takes me out , he must just have even more fun without me, then again must be nice to hang out with your ex girlfriend every weekend. yes i know i let him hang out with june, most of the time les is there too but still i dont think it would go over well if thats what i was doing for sure.              well jesse left today for his camping trip, he will be back on friday, i hope he has a good time. the chokers for the dogs came in but i only got 2 of the 3 i needed. tricia wasnt too bad today. she was around the house when i woke up which was nice. so i made her some scramboled eggs and me too. i slep from 9 am till 7pm it was soo nice. i could have used more im sure! god knows im gonna have to dish out sex thurs or fri or possibly sat during a nap session.  which reminds me i work this sat and so does dave, oohhh wait thats right its supposed to rain so he prob wont have to go, i think im gonna ask him to start pushing tim for a posstion at the gas station so he can make some dam money an we can pay SOME bills cus god knows i feel it in my bones im "NEDRA" and im gonna lose my house too.  food and gas for the cars are the most hardest on us . we need money!! and i wanna say that both me and dave are gonna have to pick up 2nd jobs for the summer so we can get caught up before the winter comes. and there wont be any over time to be had. i think im gonna go look at a paper while im here. catch ya later, yet still tonight possibly

      okay this seems to be working, i think i may have actualy punched thru the world of bloggin. you have no idea what it took to get here. its funny cus you can go anywhere on the web and read millioins!! but i didnt know how to begin. i would go into every chat room i have ever visted and ask everybody! is anybody in the room doing a weblog? i would ask! and 5 would answer no, and 2 would ask what is that? and not a responce from any of the other 50-90 peeps in the room! go figure huh But this is it, this is where i plan on letting lose. where i plan on letten my guard down. where im gonna get out of my head everything that wants to just pour out anyways. Its 3:42 am and im at work, this is prob where i will make the most of my entries. i work all night long at a motel. Ive decided this is gonna be my therepy. i cant see spending money or paying sombody for them to just say "how do you feel about that" or "is that what your really  thinking" besides i dont need a shrink i just need to unload some of the notes that i keep in my head!! to be able to make more room lol. oh and just be ware! im at a very low point in my life, such the reason to unload!! reacharge!! Well we could start off with just today, ill dig deeper another time, soon im sure. today i left work at 9. i went home and made me a omelet with sandwich meat and onions and cheese. and i feed the dogs and then i got really sleepy only cus i didnt get much sleep the night before and not much last "day" for me either. so i snooozed on the couch on and off till the kids got home. or should i say shortly after that since tricia decided to steal money out of my purse while i was sleeping. gggggrrrrrrrrr that soo pisses me off too. anywho i was continuessly anoyed by jesse who wanted on the internet and he needed me to put the password in for him.the girls got home and i told tawni to get on dinner.and thank god this is the last week of drivers ed!! yeahhh the drive is killing my pocket with the prices of gas!! and tonight i was supposed to teach dog obediance too but i had no way there since my jeep is a death trap, why i dont just keep driving it like dave says to, ill never know. somtimes i think he wants me dead just so he can get out of this relationship and that can be his excuse for lossing the house too. and i just found out that dave also sold some of sue and joes ebay stuff and he spent there money!!! gggrrrr that soo pisses me off !! i dont know what to do anymore. im losing ground on everything i cant belive he did that. he is falling right back into the same trap of being overwhelmed and takin what isnt his and he will go back to prison i can just feel it and then i will lose the house and i will have to deal with it all by myself and of course everybody will get the last laugh on me again for thinking it was gonna work after the last time.well i wont be around for the next time. i have money i can give to sue but i dont know how much i should owe her for the things he already sold and plus he still has to get those things shipped out to them too! i think about it every day oh how we will lose the house. cus its gonna happen i just know it. i just dont see how we are gonna be able to save the house. we are 2 payments behind already.thats 2000.00 bucks! i have 4 kids and 3 dogs and im gonna have to give the dogs up when we lose the house. well today i think i am gonna shoo myself out of here right away when jane comes in.im gonan go make another omelet(cus im on a diet)cus im soo fat its scary!and ill take care of the dogs and then im gonna lock myself in my room and get some good sleep. i have off on thurs and friday and i can just bet you that on friday dave doesnt ask me to go out with him again . its not to often when i have off and have the energy to go out with him, cus i worked the night before, and he always asks me 10 mins before he is ready to go out too! so i dont have enough time to get ready cus he wont wanna wait. well i think im gonna go watch t.v.  i might come back to unload more but who knows yet, i have soo much on my mind that its all coming at once.

      i cant help but feel this way, i know im not the best mom. and i dont even have any family to lean on. my mother is dead, my dad lives in las vegas. and now so does my only sister and my only brother. who are wayy younger than i am anyways so what would they know about all my probs. im pretty sure dave doesnt want to be in the picture. i think he likes what he gets out of being around and that covers everything from having his own home which still isnt totaly secure yet, to getting sex with out asking or paying for it, to he has his childeren but i dont think he wants to be around them all the time. i wish i could do somthing that made me happy. but i just cant seem to do that either, i dont even know what makes me happy anymore. certanly not dave. i swear if i have some kind of STD from dave i am totaly gonna lose it.i coulndt stand to see him with anybody else. even though im sure he has his eyes on a few.  i wish i did too. and i really dont want somebody to come to me and tell me how he is hanging on all these woman when he goes out. god that would just look soo dam bad, and if he had a fling with june...... well i dont know i think that would make me feel soo dam low. in one way i wanna know if he did with anybody so i could cut him off at home. he dont deserve what he gets from me and belive me its pretty pathedic. hell i dont even participate. but that dont stop him. so if i could say he was getting it somplace else then i could say i dont have to put out anymore. and i dont have to take the way he touches me.and then i could know that after tricia moves out then he would be gone and i could move on with my life. and i kinda like that idea. moving on . with out dave. as much as i hate the idea of being alone hell i was alone for 4 years just not in my mind. but hell i made it all work, i kept a roof over my head and paid the bills, and didnt bounce one GOD DAM CHECK but now he his home and hell i guess we can live way beyond our means now or at least thats how he likes to live his life. i mean i dont mind spending when we shouldnt somtimes but, i cant live like this im finding it hard to cope, hard to deal with everyday life! how do i get out of this, i cant just tell him to leave. and besides now we have the house. before i could have told him that we just need to go our differnt ways.  god why he stays around i dont know. we dont agree on anything. you name it we dont agree anymore. and he is sooooooo FULL of opions!! god i hate how HE would do it different. well i dont see him in any of those kind of possitions, managers, running a bussness nadda!! but hes got an ear full for all those people or at least i get to hear how he would run all there bussness. i wish we could just agree to live under the same roof but thats it. he doesnt want me anymore so why should he have to stay. why should i have to put out for him if he dont want to be there. i think he did somthing with sombody and thats why i have somthing. i dont think i bedsunburnt my cooch , i think he gave me somthing or his hands werent clean ! one or the other. i just need to know for sure, just for my health and for my mind. i know it will kill me to know that he has feelings for anybody other than me , i mean its different if he just didnt have feelings for me anymore but for him to actualy be happy with sombody else. that would be horrible. one of my daughters passed her test for driving, and the one everybody thought would pass failed. i dont know what to think, nadia has just been unbearable and i swear since she has been in counceling it has gotten worse. im ready to pull my hair out here and all i can do is fight with dave about every step of it. im soo tired of it all i wish i could just walk away from it all and get my own place. i dont want to be with dave, mostly cus i can tell he dont want to be with me. we have been together for 15 yrs and the fact that he dont care if i put that ring back on my finger and that he really dont want to marry me. cus belive me i wanna be married!!! but i dont want to marry the guy that dave is right now and thats frustraiting too . i think this weekend i will attempt to spy on him. i think i will. i think i could easly at vans but it would be harder at the greystone.
