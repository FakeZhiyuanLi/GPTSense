      Fat-slob Moore caught again with his pants down. Fred Barnes of the Conservative "Weekly Standard," Says lied about  urlLink interview  with him. So now Moore fits the infamous Stephen Glass, Jason Blaire types.

      Tonight I was strolling through the market, and I came upon some kids fishing for baby turtles. That is, there was a tub of water with baby turtles and paperclips taped to their outer shells, kids with fishing lines and a magnet, where playing this timed game, who can acquire the most turtles in a certain time frame. I thought to myself this is good multicultural, good in that PETA (wacked Out leftest org.) would flip its Hostess Twinkees if they saw this animal volating act. I laughed to myself!

      Taipei is a city to easily get lost in, I have wandered the streets late at night now and sometimes during the day trying to get my mind around the geography here. Perhaps a Pocket Pc w/ a GPS is in order for me. I am also overwhelmed by the Asian culture more broadly. The food possibilities seem endless, the smells I have never before smelt such dynamics w/ my olfactory. They have this tofu here that is fried a certain way and it smells, so you guessed it: It's called "stinky tofu."

       urlLink    This is some fantastic soup, the Chinese & Taiwanese both claim that this is a healthy concoction of some sort. I am posting this a day later I am still alive, the soup basically tasted like it was spiked with tolet water and...and. No but really a cultural experience is just that.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is Christine slurping down a kiwi drink after we just had some Western food. I can only eat Eastern food about once to twice a day then I must get myself to Western-style food outlet. Christine says that my stomach is picky, and it likes to argue with her normal food likes. Well what is normal to her is quite different to what we have come to know in the West. Christine said hello to the family and would love to meet you guys sometime. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is my new scooter, Christine took this shot, she lives in this building that I am parked at. My scooter is like a chooper. That is, it is a 150cc (most scooters are 50cc here, double seated). I figured the bigger the bike, and the bigger the engine gives me a better chance at getting the hell out of the way when physical danger ensues upon me. My scooter is fun to ride and a relaxing chance to free the feeling of freedom. Many Taiwanese seem to agree, in other words, Taiwan is the capital of scooters. And that would make China the capital of the bicycle.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This was a work party that I went to the other night, the chicken leg is something they eat here, sometimes even the fingernails of the chicken legs themselves. If the picture was better you would see the fingerprint-like marks on the skin...I have tried them but only with great gastronomical discretion.&nbsp; urlLink
