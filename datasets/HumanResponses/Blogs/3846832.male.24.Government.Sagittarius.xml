      Been an interesting week up here in the grand city of Summerside.&nbsp; I talked to Rosalyn on Monday for like 3 hours.&nbsp; It was a very nice conversation.&nbsp; I forgot how much I missed talking to her.&nbsp; She is really the only person who phones me up in Summerside, so it was no big deal to talk for so long.&nbsp;   On&nbsp;Tuesday Rosalyn stopped by to give me an orange plant.&nbsp; She had mentioned it on Monday, but I figured it would still be a little while until I saw her.&nbsp; But she wanted to do some shopping so she wanted to drop the plant off around 6:30pm.&nbsp; I met her at the Western School Board and then showed her&nbsp;my apartment.&nbsp; I figured she wouldn't stay long and would take a look then leave.&nbsp; But, she ended up staying for like 5 hours and we had a pretty good time.&nbsp; We talked for a while and watched some tv.&nbsp; She was looking very attractive and we were kind of flirting&nbsp;a bit.&nbsp; We were quite close together then we decided to go in my room and talk.&nbsp; It was a little weird.&nbsp; Our faces were practically right against each other.&nbsp; At one point, our lips were so close that when I would talk, my lips would brush against her lips.&nbsp; I tried to resist as long as I could, but then I kissed her and it was full on making out after that for a few minutes.&nbsp; It seemed as though it might get a little more passioniate but we decided to stop at the kissing.&nbsp; It was too bad really.&nbsp; She said that if we had started kissing a bit earlier, we probably would have ended up having sex.&nbsp; I honestly don't know if I could have even done it anyway, so it was no big deal.&nbsp; It was actually good to get that out of our system.&nbsp; Before we had started kissing, we were both acting like a couple of dorks.&nbsp; We both knew what we wanted to do, but we were both too scared to make a move.&nbsp; After we were done, we were able to hang out like normal people and enjoy a show called trading spouses.&nbsp;   Despite the seeming normalcy of the evening after the makeout session, she still doesn't think we should hang out for a while because she doesn't know if she can do it.&nbsp; I don't know why she just can't be friends.&nbsp; I am ready to just hang out and watch tv, or go to a movie or something but she says she still isn't.&nbsp; I don't think she realizes that if we don't hang out now, we won't be hanging out at all.&nbsp; She will be going to Italy on August 22, then when she gets home, school will have started.&nbsp; She will be in Charlottetown all week and at the cottage all weekend probably.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I'll be in Summerside all week, and Charlottetown on weekends.&nbsp; So if we don't hang out now, we won't hang out ever really.  She said she might be ready to be good friends by next summer.&nbsp; I didn't have the heart to say why bother.&nbsp; She will be going away to school next September.&nbsp; I would like to be friends with her now.&nbsp; I can separate my past feelings for her from my current feelings for her.&nbsp; Even though we made out, and it was great, I still realize that there is no point in us getting back together.&nbsp; She knows this too, but she feels bad if we kiss.&nbsp; I don't see the problem at all.&nbsp; Frankly, I wouldn't see it as a problem if we were making out on a regular basis or something.&nbsp; I don't want our relationship to be just about that, but we both know we are not right for each other.&nbsp; But hey, as long as we're not seeing anyone else, let's have a little fun.&nbsp; This whole thing is making wish that I could ask Aimee out.&nbsp; I actually had a dream about her last night, and not Rosalyn.&nbsp; Kind of weird I guess.  And the other thing about last night, the fucking bugs.&nbsp; I've got some sort of beetle colony in my apartment.&nbsp; I got rid of the ants, but I must have flushed like 7 beetles down the toilet last night.&nbsp; They are big, scary and gross.&nbsp; Gonna pick something up today to kill them.&nbsp; I think I know where they come from so hopefully this will do the trick.  Today was payday, so I'm getting my gym membership and getting a de-humidifier.&nbsp; Until next time!

      It is July 26 today.&nbsp; Almost August.&nbsp; Will someone please tell me what happened to my summer?&nbsp; Soon it is going to be September, and I'll be like "what the hell did I do this summer?"&nbsp; I really haven't done anything memorable.&nbsp; No concerts, no travelling, been to the beach once.&nbsp; That was probably the highlight of the summer so far.&nbsp; How sad.&nbsp; Been working out a lot lately though.&nbsp; Feeling good about the body.&nbsp; Gonna get my membership to the AFC this week too.&nbsp; This will be the first full week I spend in Summerside.&nbsp; Should be interesting.&nbsp;   Weekend was pretty good.&nbsp; Didn't do anything Friday but went out Saturday.&nbsp; Had the whole crew out, minus Doran.&nbsp; He has the flew or something.&nbsp; Drank at Marc's then hit up Myron's.&nbsp; It was a weird night really.&nbsp; We sat downstairs for most of the time and we were all arm wrestling.&nbsp; Aimee was looking pretty hot as well.&nbsp; Ran into a few people, but nothing too exciting.&nbsp; Me and Brad were talking to this girl outside of Myron's afterwords.&nbsp; Don't know how it started but it was an interesting conversation.&nbsp; I think we talked about politics and music and what not.&nbsp; I think she said she was in Anthropology or something.&nbsp; She may also be going out with Jonah, I know I have seen them together anyway.&nbsp; Apparently I got home at 4:13am and that was the night.&nbsp; Not sure why it was so late.&nbsp; Didn't get pizza or anything.&nbsp; But it was a fun night nonetheless.   Sunday went to my grandmother's for supper.&nbsp; Wasn't really hungry or anything.&nbsp; Then came back to Summerside to discover my new roommates, the ants.&nbsp; Lysol seemed to kill them pretty quickly though, but they just keep coming back.&nbsp; Gonna get something professional to kill them with today.&nbsp;   Rosalyn phoned a couple of times this weekend too.&nbsp; I miss talking to her.&nbsp; It was Jackie's wedding this weekend as well.&nbsp; I guess it went off without a hitch, but I haven't actually talked to Rosalyn about it.&nbsp; It is weird, she will phone me, but she will never e-mail me.&nbsp; She doesn't have access to her computer much though.&nbsp; I think I will only e-mail her once or twice a week anyway.&nbsp; There really isn't much point in e-mailing her cause she doesn't get to check it, plus, she never e-mails me back anyway.&nbsp; I guess I would rather talk to her than communicate by e-mail so that is cool.   No other news at the moment.&nbsp; Going to be a slow week I think.&nbsp; Big toga party this Saturday though.&nbsp; Gonna hit that up solid.&nbsp; No plans of actually wearing a toga, but if everyone else is, I will as well.&nbsp; The last toga party had a pretty good crowd apparently, despite the shitty weather.&nbsp; Hopefully it will be nice this weekend.&nbsp; This could be the highlight of the summer.   Been listening to None More Black and the new Vandals cd lately.&nbsp; It is turning out to be pretty good.&nbsp; I'll have to give it a few more weeks though.&nbsp; And in a shocking announcement, Ricky Williams of the Miami Dolphins has announced his retirement.&nbsp; I couldn't believe it at first, but I guess he is extremely shy, and hated the spotlight.&nbsp; He said he feels free now, and will not be coming back.&nbsp; I think I respect him a lot more now.&nbsp; To walk away from football like that, in your prime and earning millions of dollars.&nbsp; No matter how much I hated it, I would stick around.&nbsp; Apparently he is going to go back to school, get his degree in education and work with children.&nbsp; How cool is that?&nbsp; Way to go Ricky.

      So it is Friday once again.&nbsp; Just spent the last 2 days in training at Regional Office.&nbsp; It was pretty much a waste of time.&nbsp; It is strange how they will provide training regarding basic EI information, but when it comes to getting training regarding screens or anything, your SOL.&nbsp;   This weekend looks pretty promising.&nbsp; Not weather wise, but I think it should be a good weekend.&nbsp; Looks like I'll be hitting up the town of Summerside on Saturday.&nbsp; Might go to the beach, but it is supposed to rain right now.&nbsp; Hopefully the weather will change before Saturday, but I doubt it.&nbsp; It is supposed to be warm though, so maybe we will still go.&nbsp; The plan right now is for me, Doran and Scotty to go out.&nbsp; Hopefully Brad, Billie and Marc will be up for it too.&nbsp; Will have to make some phone calls tonight to see what everyone thinks.&nbsp; Apparently the orothodox softball championships are being played in Summerside this weekend too, so hopefully there will be a big crowd of ladies out!   Other than that, not much has been going on.&nbsp; Been to the gym Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.&nbsp; Going to the AFC in Summerside after work.&nbsp; Man, that place is so cramped.&nbsp; There really isn't much room there, but they decided to put as much equipment in there as possible.&nbsp; The gym isn't that great.&nbsp; It is kind of a mixture of UPEI, CCRC, and the AFC in Charlottetown.&nbsp; Sadly, it isn't enough like the AFC (equipment wise at least) but it will have to do.&nbsp; I'm gonna buy some jump rope this weekend too.&nbsp; That will give a better workout then jogging, and hopefully, I can do it right in the apartment.&nbsp; If not, I'll take it outside to the grass or something.   Other than that, it has been a nice week.&nbsp; The warm weather has finally arrived.&nbsp; Just wish I had something to do other than go to the gym.&nbsp; I guess I will get to enjoy it more next year I hope.&nbsp; My sunburn has been causing me to itch like hell.&nbsp; It has subsided now, but there were a few sleepless nights this week.&nbsp; I'm gonna get some sunscreen next time I go to the beach.&nbsp; The burn just wasn't worth it.&nbsp; Well, maybe it was.&nbsp; It isn't as red now, and people really do look better with a tan.&nbsp; But not that orange skin type tan.&nbsp; That is gross.&nbsp; I don't want to be leatherface when I'm 35 from sitting in the sun all day.&nbsp; Doran might have that problem someday.   Just heard too that a friend of my grandfather died recently.&nbsp; It is kind of scary actually.&nbsp; The guy seemed pretty healthy and was only in his 40's.&nbsp; He went to see his doctor one day and the doc referred him to another doctor.&nbsp; This guy decided to put him in the hospital and they eventually found some cancer.&nbsp; So they sent him over to Halifax and things appeared to be going good.&nbsp; Then, they discovered that the cancer was on some other organs.&nbsp; A few weeks later he was dead.&nbsp; This whole process happened in like less than 3 months.&nbsp; One day he feels perfectly healthy.&nbsp; The next, he goes to his doctor, finds out he has cancer, his whole life is thrown upside down and he gets treatment.&nbsp; Then, 3 months later he is dead.&nbsp; He has a wife and 2 kids as well.&nbsp; The doctors told them that he only had a few weeks to live and they were right.&nbsp; How fucking crazy is that?&nbsp; Cancer is scary shit.&nbsp; I think we should be putting more resources into fighting cancer, than any other diseases.&nbsp; My grandfather died of cancer but at least he smoked and drank his whole life.&nbsp; I don't want to be healthy one day and then find out I have cancer the next.&nbsp; I just pray that I don't die of cancer some day.&nbsp; The dudes name was Wayne and I guess before he died, they asked where he wanted to be buried.&nbsp; Keep in mind he was sick as hell and literally on his deathbed.&nbsp; But I guess he got enough strength to say that he wanted to be buried as close to Harry (my grandfather) as possible.&nbsp;   My grandfather died a few years ago at 73, and Wayne wasn't related to him or anything but I guess my grandfather was kind of like a father to him.&nbsp; My mom was saying that at the wake, Wayne's real father was acting like nothing even happened.&nbsp; She thinks he was almost jealous that he wasn't the centre of attention.&nbsp; What a fucking cold hearted prick?&nbsp; That guy should be dying of cancer.&nbsp; But I think this says a lot about my grandfather.&nbsp; He was a hell of a guy and he always treated me better than any other grand children.&nbsp; I think it was because my mom got divorced when I was only 2 or 3 years old.&nbsp; My relationship with my dad was sporadic, but I could always count on my grandfather.&nbsp; It was sad when he died, but it was also good because he was a proud man and he lost a lot of weight and strenght because of the cancer.&nbsp; I think he was embarrassed or ashamed because of it.&nbsp; His death finally put him out of his misery so that was how it was kind of a good thing.&nbsp; The thing is though, I never cried at his funeral or anything.&nbsp; But then when my girlfriend dumped me a few months ago, I cried like a little school girl.&nbsp; Thinking about my grandfather now really puts things in perspective, and made me realize that it was only a relationship, it wasn't my life.&nbsp; Anyway, I miss you grampie.

      Wow.&nbsp; A lot of stuff has happened since I posted last on Friday.&nbsp; Let's start from Friday night I guess.&nbsp; My mom had a party for her co-workers while I watched Badder Santa upstairs.&nbsp; It was a decent movie, but not as funny as I hoped it would.&nbsp; Yeah the cursing is funny, but that is pretty much it.&nbsp; As for the "Badder" part of Badder Santa.&nbsp; I don't know&nbsp;what they were talking about.&nbsp; There was no nudity in the movie.&nbsp; There was plenty of cursing, but that must have been included in Bad Santa as well.&nbsp; Anyway, decent movie.&nbsp; I would recommend it as a rental. &nbsp; On to Saturday.&nbsp; Went&nbsp;to the beach with Doran and his friend Becca.&nbsp; Nice girl, but I don't think anything is going to happen between them.&nbsp; It was super hot that day and I finally got some sun on my pathetic chest. Unfortuneately, I chose not to wear sunscreen and I am feeling the effects today.&nbsp; My chest and stomach is very red.&nbsp; It isn't painful, but it itches like a son of a bitch.&nbsp; I have had trouble sleeping the last two nights because of the burn.&nbsp; Hopefully it will turn into a nice tan shortly.&nbsp; So we stayed at the beach for like 4 hours.&nbsp; The water was cold as shit at first, but was quite refreshing after a while.&nbsp; I am really starting to like the beach.&nbsp; Plus, the beach was full of hot women.&nbsp; Also saw Aimee there as well.&nbsp; Good old Aimee.&nbsp; She is a great girl, looked pretty smoking in her bikini too.&nbsp; After talking to her at the beach for a bit, I strongly considered asking her to go to the beach tomorrow.&nbsp; Not on a date or anything, but with me and Doran and anyone else who wanted to go.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So after the beach, me and Doran wanted to get a few drinks and go out.&nbsp; Sadly, nobody else wanted to go out, so it was me and Doran stuck on my mother's lovely deck for a few hours.&nbsp; We gave Billie a call and he ended up coming over and then we headed to Myron's.&nbsp; I thought the night would be a disaster cause Doran would be trying to pick up, and Billie would likely run into his girlfriend.&nbsp; We get in and I instantly lose everyone.&nbsp; I see Aimee working though, so I bought a rev off her.&nbsp; Didn't talk to her too much, because I thought I would talk to her later in the night.&nbsp; So I went upstairs looking for the fellas.&nbsp; Ran into a few people but no sign of anyone.&nbsp; Go back downstairs and who do I run into?&nbsp; My ex girlfriend, Rosalyn.&nbsp; It was her friends bachelorette party, so they were out partying it up.&nbsp; Rosalyn doesn't drink much, and she rarely goes to the bar, so I was quite surprised to see her.&nbsp; We hadn't really talked in a few weeks so we started talking then decided to go to a booth where it was a bit quieter.&nbsp; So we are talking for a few minutes and I was like, fuck it, I'm gonna kiss her.&nbsp; So I leaned in and gave her the worst kiss of all time.&nbsp; I immediately apologized, but then she kissed me and it was all good.&nbsp; One of the hottest kisses of my life.&nbsp; So we chatted some more but then the future bride came over and dragged her away.&nbsp; That was terrible.&nbsp; We have only hung out once since we broke up in May and Saturday was the second time.&nbsp; It was fun just being with her and she was looking pretty hot.&nbsp; But we are communicating again, and we both realize that the kiss doesn't mean anything, we were just drunk.&nbsp; But I have sent her an e-mail, and I think things will be good again. &nbsp; So that was Saturday.&nbsp; Sunday was spent moving into my new apartment in Summerside.&nbsp; God I hate moving.&nbsp; What a pain in the ass.&nbsp; It didn't take too long to get everything unloaded and moved up here, but it took a while to get everything in the apartment organized.&nbsp; I like the apartment a lot but it does have some problems.&nbsp; Part of the floor in my bedroom is always wet for some reason.&nbsp; I'll have to investigate that.&nbsp; And my toilet isn't working right now.&nbsp; That is the biggest pain.&nbsp; I left a message with the guy I have been dealing with, but nothing has happened yet.&nbsp; Sunday night, me, Scott, Doran and Billie went to see I, Robot.&nbsp; What a terrible movie.&nbsp; I wish we had just gone and seen Anchorman again.&nbsp; That movie was hilarious.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So that was my weekend.&nbsp; Pretty fun if you ask me.&nbsp; Hopefully next weekend will be equally fun.&nbsp; I'm still setting up the apartment.&nbsp; Tried to install the internet yesterday, but it isn't working for some reason.&nbsp; It's not so bad.&nbsp; I'm going to Charlottetown tonight since I have training at Regional office on Wednesday and Thursday.&nbsp; Probably will come back up Thursday night, and back to Charlottetown after work Friday.&nbsp; I hope the weather is half as good.&nbsp; This time I will get sunscreen and not burn myself.&nbsp; I better have the internet at home by then too.&nbsp; I miss having it at home.&nbsp; I would write in this blog more if I did.&nbsp; Got free cable for the moment though.&nbsp; Hopefully that will last for a while.&nbsp; Tonight I am going to the gym in Summerside.&nbsp; Not sure how good it is, will find out soon.&nbsp; It is like a 30 minute walk from my apartment too, but that will give me my cardio workout I suppose.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Currently listening to Rise Against's first record.&nbsp; I loved Revolutions per Minute and kind of took their first record for granted, but it is quite good.&nbsp; Can't wait until the next album which is due this fall I believe. Adios!

      Busy day for posts today.&nbsp; But this post just couldn't wait.&nbsp; Why you ask?&nbsp; I just saw my ex girlfriend. &nbsp; I had written her an e-mail yesterday saying she had some mail at the office where I work.&nbsp; When I got to work today, I checked my e-mail and she hadn't responded, so I figured she hadn't read the e-mail.&nbsp; Maybe she didn't respond because of how I worded the e-mail.&nbsp; It sounded pretty cold I guess.&nbsp; Then, at about 1:30ish, I was covering the front desk and who walks in?&nbsp; My ex, Rosalyn.&nbsp; She works in the Kensington area so I guess she decided it would be easiest to pick the mail up herself.&nbsp; She works in the Environmental Futures program, so she was wearing clothes that were kind of dirty.&nbsp; I almost didn't recognize her at first.&nbsp; She still looked cute as a button though.&nbsp; That is one thing about her.&nbsp; No matter what she looks like, she always looks cute and sweet.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So she came in and I got the mail for her and we talked for a minute.&nbsp; Unfortunaetly, it was pretty busy, so I didn't really have time to talk to her.&nbsp; We basically only had a minute or two and then she had to go to take the students she works with home.&nbsp; I don't know how she felt about seeing me, but I was happy to see her.&nbsp; It didn't feel weird or anything either.&nbsp; Maybe it's because I was at work, and she was in her work clothes (t shirt, dirty jeans, big rubber boots), but I wasn't too nervous, and I wasn't internally thinking that I want to get back together.&nbsp; Of course, if she had come in looking smoking hot, it could have been a different story.&nbsp; So anyway, we haven't talked for a few weeks and it was good to talk again, if only for a minute.&nbsp; She seemed fine at first too, but when she was leaving she started to cry a bit.&nbsp; She cries a lot, and it doesn't take much to get her to cry, but still.&nbsp; It was very sweet and it kind of made me feel good.&nbsp; It is nice to know that she still cares about me I guess.&nbsp; I feel kind of bad about being so upset about her going to Italy.&nbsp; Her reaction today leads me to believe that maybe she isn't back together with Andrea.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; But I guess even if she is, that is OK.&nbsp; I mean, I wish she wasn't, but I think I can accept that and still be friends with her.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So who knows whats going to happen from here.&nbsp; I told her I would e-mail her next week once I get my computer set up.&nbsp; That was when she was still crying, so I don't know if she wants more time apart, or maybe she doesn't want to hear from me at all.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I'll find out next week I guess.&nbsp; I don't know what kind of relationship we will have.&nbsp; It sounds like she is kind of having a rough time right now, so maybe she will want to be friends.&nbsp; It might be kind of weird if we were to hang out alone, especially if it were at my apartment, but I don't think that would be a good idea.&nbsp; I mean, I would like to hang out with her, but I think it would be best if we went for a walk or something.&nbsp; Hanging out alone would likely be weird.&nbsp; The best thing to do would probably be talking by phone, but I'll see how the e-mails go I guess.&nbsp; Don't know what I should say in that e-mail last week.&nbsp; I will keep it fairly short, and mostly just ask her questions.&nbsp; I don't have anything to talk about anyway.&nbsp; It should be an interesting week next week though.&nbsp; Until then blog!!

      The weekend is here and it promises to be nice.&nbsp; I will finally make it to the beach tomorrow, if Doran doesn't forget.&nbsp; I had a small tan earlier in the year after playing street hockey, but this will be the first time I have had my shirt off outside all summer.&nbsp; I am quite excited to go to the beach.&nbsp; Probably going to head to Tracadie.&nbsp; From what Doran tells me, that is the beach to be at.&nbsp; You can have a few beers, go swimming, throw around the football.&nbsp; I am pumped.&nbsp; Plus, all the girls will be there in their bikinis!!&nbsp; Can't wait for that!&nbsp; Apparently there are quite a few hotties who go there.&nbsp; Doran has saw this girl Dawnia twice in a bikini.&nbsp; Who is she you ask?&nbsp; Only one of the hottest girls I have ever seen in my life.&nbsp; I would give my left nut to see her in a bikini.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doran gets to go like everyday the lucky son of a bitch.&nbsp; I can't wait to just go once.&nbsp; Hopefully there&nbsp;will be some nice looking ladies!! &nbsp; Speaking of&nbsp;ladies, Doran&nbsp;went on his second date of the week last night.&nbsp; What a lucky fuck.&nbsp; I think it is going to be a long time before I ever go on a date.&nbsp; My mother has talked about hooking me up with one of the nurses she works with at the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I appreciate that mother, but I don't do blind dates, unless it is for a television show.&nbsp; She has brought it&nbsp;up a couple of&nbsp;times.&nbsp; It is quite embarrassing and sad really.&nbsp; I guess she is&nbsp;having a few ladies over tonight from work.&nbsp; So they are all going to be drinking&nbsp;on the&nbsp;deck and in the house and having a great time.&nbsp; This is my worst nightmare.&nbsp; I pray that something&nbsp;is going on tonight.&nbsp; How sad would it be to have my mom partying, while I am stuck upstairs watching television.&nbsp; Answer, it would be extremely sad.&nbsp; I'm gonna go to the gym and&nbsp;take a run, but by the time I am done of that, it will only be 10:00pm at the latest.&nbsp; So it is going to be a miserable night.&nbsp; But hey,&nbsp;I get the keys to my new&nbsp;apartment today, and I move in on Sunday, so I have something to look forward too at least. &nbsp; It hasn't been too bad living with my mom the last few weeks.&nbsp; I have been&nbsp;home alone quite a bit actually.&nbsp; Her roomate is rarely home, and my mom has been working&nbsp;nights, so I can crank the tunes, play some drums, or just relax in peace.&nbsp; The room I am in is small as hell though, and I&nbsp;only have 1 dresser&nbsp; to fit all my clothes in.&nbsp; It is very cramped and I can't wait to get to the new spacious apartment, even if it is in Summerside.&nbsp; I am hoping the guys will want to come up some weekend and we can tear up the mean streets of Summerside.&nbsp; Probably won't be for a while though. &nbsp; Made it to the gym last night.&nbsp; Did legs and back.&nbsp; Then I dropped the car off to my mom at the QEH and ran back to her house on Sydney street, which is right beside the Dominion building.&nbsp; The first time I did it, it took me like 25 minutes.&nbsp; Last night it only took like 20.&nbsp; I am quite proud.&nbsp; I ran from the QEH, all the way up to the lights by Tim Hortons without stopping.&nbsp; It was quite difficult.&nbsp; I have trouble breathing when I run too much.&nbsp; It is like I can't quite get a deep breath.&nbsp; Maybe I have asthma or something.&nbsp; But yeah, I ran that whole distance without stopping or walking.&nbsp; Now granted, I wasn't running terrible fast, but you have to start off slow.&nbsp; After a few months, I should be running at a pretty good clip.&nbsp; The distance from my mom's to the QEH is like 3km too, so I think I am doing pretty good.&nbsp; Gonna hit up the gym tonight.&nbsp; Do some chest, biceps, and forearms.&nbsp; May take a run along the boardwalk after that if nothing is going on.&nbsp; That will be 10 times I have gone to the gym in the last 2 weeks.&nbsp; Plus, I have ran on 3 days this week for at least 20 minutes.&nbsp; Well, I didn't run the entire 20 minutes, but for a good portion.&nbsp; The heart rate was bumping and that is what is important.&nbsp; My mom even noticed how I have put on some muscle.&nbsp; That is the best feeling in the world when someone tells you that you have put on some muscle, even if it is from your mom.&nbsp; Thanks momma!

      Prince Edward Island is quite the place folks.&nbsp; There is a couple who are making news for bestiality.&nbsp; A woman is being charged with bestiality, while her boyfriend is being charged for encouraging her to commit the act.&nbsp; How disgusting is this??&nbsp; What kind of sick fantasies did this couple have?&nbsp; It is so sad to have to read about this in the local newspaper.&nbsp; I'm suprised it hasn't made national news or something.&nbsp; I would like to think that acts like these are extremely rare.&nbsp; I'm not sure what poor animal was the victim in this case.&nbsp; I thought I read something about it being a dog a while ago.&nbsp; Who knows what this woman did to the poor animal.&nbsp; I shudder to even think about it.&nbsp; Hopefully the boyfriend at least left the poor animal alone.&nbsp;  &nbsp; And from that, we move on to the subject of homosexuality.&nbsp; The gay pride parade was held here in Charlottetown last week and I happened to be walking downtown at the time.&nbsp; I thought it was quite an amusing little parade.&nbsp; I don't understand why people get so upset about homosexuals.&nbsp; This whole gay marriage issue is really a non issue to me.&nbsp; They want to get married, go nuts!&nbsp; I support gay marriage, and I like the fact that churches will not be forced to marry homosexuals.&nbsp; So what the fuck is the problem?&nbsp; These homophobes get their panties all twisted because it will ruin the definition of marriage, or fundamentally change our society.&nbsp; I bet they thought that when blacks were allowed to drink out of the same fountain.&nbsp; Nothing will change if a gay couple is allowed to get married.&nbsp; It will have no effect on you, or me, or my future (god willing) marriage.&nbsp; And I also see nothing wrong with a gay couple raising children.&nbsp; As long as they love the children, there is no problem.&nbsp; 2 (gay) parents are better than one in my opinion.&nbsp; I was raised by a single mother, and I turned out alright. &nbsp; A reverand decided to write a letter to the editor in today's Guardian.&nbsp; He is going on about how we should not accept homosexuality and that they are sinners and they will pay for being gay when they die.&nbsp; This guy is a fucking idiot.&nbsp; I would love to attend his service and just call him a homophobic piece of shit.&nbsp; How the hell did he ever become a reverand?&nbsp; Aren't they supposed to speak about love and acceptance?&nbsp; I wonder what his opinions are on molesting children?&nbsp; His colleagues in the US seem to think it is alright, but heaven forbid if you are gay.&nbsp; This guy should be speaking out about pedophilia committed by the clergy, not whether two adult men are sinning by being gay.&nbsp; He goes on to state how it is not natural and blah, blah, blah.&nbsp; I believe that you are born gay, and you can't change that.&nbsp; Some people like to say that they were gay but then realized the truth and they are now straight and have a family.&nbsp; These people are either in denial, or they were never gay to begin with.&nbsp; Why the hell are we still worried if people are gay?&nbsp; It should not be an issue in the year 2004.&nbsp; They just want equal rights, that is it.&nbsp; If we give them equal rights, we wouldn't even think about gay couples.&nbsp; The only reason they are in the news is because they want the same rights as a straight couple, nothing more.&nbsp; They don't want to force churches to marry them, they don't want to turn your son or daughter gay, and they don't want to have sex with children.&nbsp; So to all you ignorant, hypocrital regligous types, I say fuck off.&nbsp; And to the general population, homophobes can fuck off.

      So I finally got my first paycheque from working at HRSDC.  I started working like June 23 or something but it takes 3 weeks to get your first cheque, and then it is only a one week cheque.  But nonetheless, the pay is quite good, so it is fine that it is only for one week.  Sadly, it is practically all gone already.  I paid $214 on my credit card, and $250 on my line of credit.  My goal is to have at least the line of credit paid off by September 15.  How much is that you ask?  It is $3300 dollars!  I don't actually think I will pay it off completely, but it will be close.  I still have to pay for rent and shit, so it will be tight living for the next few months, but I gotta get my loans paid off while I have a job like this.  If I get extended past September, then I will tackle my student loans.  I have like $16,000 in student loans, but my mom has savings bonds for me that are worth like $4,000.  If I can work for HRSDC for a year, I hope to have all my student loans paid off.  Boy would that be a dream come true.  Then if I am still working in Summerside, I would get a $20,000 car loan, buy a Volkswagen Golf, and move back to Charlottetown and move in with a couple of friends.  That is assuming they aren't all married or living with girlfriends by then.  Me and Doran are the only sad sacks without a lady friend in their life.  I am really the sad one, as Doran has the phone number of half the women in Charlottetown.  He has had some trouble setting up a date with them though, so that makes me feel a bit better.  But Scott is back with Martine, Marc is of course with Jana, Brad and Amanda are attached at the hip, and Billie has a girlfriend too.  I would like to meet someone, but I can't really have a girlfriend now anyway.  I mean, I am up in Summerside for weekdays, then in Charlottetown for weekends.  Couldn't really pull off having a girlfriend for just the weekdays or just weekends.  But old Scotty can do it, but he has a car.  Martine lives in Summerside but they seem to be doing quite well.  I am happy for him though, Scottie is a great guy.  Anyway, my girlfriend for the next few months will be the gym, and other forms of excersise.  I vow to be in killer shape by September 15.  I am sacrificing this summer for the sake of the long term good.  Then, next summer, I will be in great shape, and maybe I will even have a car or something, who knows.  Then I can work on trying to find the woman I was meant for.    "But for now, while everything's calm, relate to the matter as I drop the bomb. Cause I'm housin!"  Oh yeah, I'm gonna start posting what music I am listening to at the moment.  Seen this on someone else's blog and it is a great idea.  I will try to start my posts with it, but for this one, I will conclude with what I am listening too.  So on the drive up today, I was listening too: None More Black - File Under Black I haven't listened to this cd a while.  Never really gave it the credit it deserves.  I expect their next album excellent since they now have Dave Wagun???? behind the kit (can't spell his name).  He plays with Good Riddance, Paint it Black, and he played with Kid Dynamite.  Basically, he is a drumming whore.  Loyal to noone!!

      I can't believe it is Thursday already!  This week is going by pretty good.  My life is basically on hold all week until weekends.  I don't really talk to my friends (except Doran) during the week, and then I talk to the fellas on weekends.  That is working alright for now, but it will soon suck ass because I will be in Summerside and if I want to hang out with someone, I am shit out of luck.  Those are the times I will have to get my ass off the computer and go to the gym.  Speaking of the gym, I am quite proud of myself today.  I went to the gym yesterday, which isn't that big a deal, but considering the circumstances, I think it is.  You see, I had a nap around 6:00pm, and eventually decided to wake up at like 7:30ish.  Well, the stupid charlottetown rec centre closes at 9pm, so I realized I wouldn't be going to the gym.  I had to get some groceries and eat so there was no time.  I get home at around 8:30ish from getting some food and I eat and I immediately start to feel guilty about not going to the gym.  Mom doesn't need the car either, so my plan was going to be to drop it off to her at the hospital and run home (took 20 minutes the other day, better than I thought).  So I had to cancel that idea.  Then I was like, wait a minute.  I have the car, why not go to the AFC?  So that is what I did.  I went to the AFC!!  Worked out shoulders and triceps and did some abs.  I seriously could have stayed an extra hour because I was feeling so good.  The equipment there is so much better than the CRA.  It felt good.  Plus, it wasn't uber busy either.  Just me and a few others.  Including that hot girl who apparently works at the desk there.  She is pretty muscly but she is also pretty cute.  And she wears glasses sometimes.  I think I am a bit turned on by girls who wear glasses.  Makes me feel like I can relate more I guess.  So in the end, I made it to the gym again.  I have gone Monday, Tuesday, and now Wednesday and I am all over it tonight.  I have never felt in better shape (muscle wise anyway).  Still got some work to do on the stomach, but it will be gone by September!!  Ran into a friend of my ex-girlfriends at the Superstore yesterday.  I never really thought of her in a "she is cute" kind of way, but ever since I saw her at the end of semester pub, I realized she is actually pretty hot.  Then I hung out with her a lot for grad week, made an ass out of myself one night, and she didn't hold it against me.  She even invites me to her birthday party.  I was quite excited about it actually, and was looking forward to going.  She is fun to hang out with, plus my girlfriend was going to be home.  I figured we could both go and have a great time.  Sadly, my girlfriend thought it would be more fun to dump my ass that day, after attending my grad party with my entire family.  I felt like an idiot, and I wish she hadn't gone in the first place.  So not only was I miserable, but now I couldn't attend the birthday party either.  So I stop thinking of any girl except my ex for like weeks (because I still loved her).  Then I see her friend working at Myron's.    I go out like every weekend so I see Aimee everytime I go to Myron's (or so it seems).  It is always fun to talk to her, and I am always teasing her or something.  So my homie Doran thinks I should ask her out.  I off course say, I can't do that, and I don't think I want to anyway because she is a friend of my ex-girlfriend.  But then my mom makes a good point.  She says that since I was the one that got dumped, I should be allowed to ask her friend out.  So I have visions of asking her out, or hanging out with her, but I am way to chicken to ask her out.  Then, my goofy friend Doran asks her to go to the beach one night while we are at Myron's.  Poor Aimee doesn't really know Doran that well, but he is not afraid to ask the ladies out so he did.  Then she says something like, "if Craig goes, I will go."  So that means one of two things.  She just didnt' want to be alone with Doran (which is understandable), or maybe she likes me.  Well, she obviously likes me, I just don't think she like likes me, ya know?  But anyway, we never went to the beach cause the weather has been ass lately.  Then we go out last Saturday, and I was hoping to see her just to say hello.  Instead of seeing Aimee, I see the ex from a couple years ago, Kate.  Being all drunk and shit, I go for Kate.  Well that was a huge mistake, but thank baby jesus that nothing happened.  We just went to her friends house and talked about my ex, and her current boyfriend.  Then I sobered up and got the hell out of dodge.  I don't hate Kate, but I don't want any sort of relationship with her anymore.  Fast forward to yesterday and who do I run into at the Superstore?  Aimee.  She works for ADL I guess.  So I talk to her for a few minutes, try to make a few jokes ("i get it Aimee, you deliver good old wholesome milk by day, then your a beer wench by night serving alcohol to blokes like me").  That was when I realize that Aimee and I could never have a relationship.  Sure, we could be friends, and I think we would get along good.  But actually going out, can't do it.  See, we are both shy people.  She is even more shy then me, so it was kind of awkward just talking to her at the Superstore.  Plus, I don't think I am actually ready for a relationship right now.  If I got involved with some girl, I would probably fall pretty hard for her, no matter how bad she actually was.  And, I would just be comparing her to my ex-girlfriend, and that wouldn't be fair.  Speaking of ex girlfriends.  I e-mailed my ex today after not communicating with her since Canada day.  She had told me she was going back to Italy (where her ex boyfriend lives) and staying for 3.5 weeks.  She had gone to Italy in April and part of May to see friends and stuff.  She lived over there for a year as an exchange student and fell in love with a guy named Andrea.  That was like 3 years ago so when she talked about wanting to go back, I thought it was a great idea.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  As soon as she got back, she dumped me.  Turns out her boyfriend told her he loved her and kissed her.  That confused her or something, so she dumped me.  It was the right decision on her part, but it still sucked.  So I originally handled it well.  We started talking and stuff after a few weeks and we were getting along good.  I was having major feelings for her and I was hoping we would get back together.  Then we were talking on the phone one night and she mentioned how she was going back to Italy in August and that 2 adults were paying for her trip.  Translation, I love Andrea and his parents are flying me over for another 3.5 weeks.  I can handle the fact that we are not going out, but I cannot handle the fact that she is going to be back in Italy and hanging out with Andrea and having fun, and kissing him.  It makes me sick, and it makes me want to fly over there and break his fucking face.  So I now hate Italy, anything to do with Italy, and I never want her to talk about Italy or Andrea with me for the rest of my life or it will put me in a bad mood.    The point though, was that I e-mailed her today.  There was some mail at Access PEI for her and I overheard the receptionist phoning someone about it.  I told her I could just e-mail her since she was my ex girlfriend.  I have wanted to e-mail her for a while, but I don't want to look like I am still hung up on her.  I mean, I still love her and everything, but I realize a relationship with her in the near future would not be worthwhile.  It would be nice for a while, but we would break up again.  I won't rule it out in the future though.  Maybe in a couple of years when she is done of school, I am sure I will be single or at least not in love, and if she was available, I would try it again.  I doubt she would, and she will probably be living in Italy with her lover Andrea.  She has talked about doing a masters degree in Italy which I think is a huge mistake.  Not because she would be in Italy, but a masters degree from a school in Italy is only going to do her good in Italy.  I don't think she would be able to move back here and get a job with a masters from Italy.  It might not be accepted in Canada.  So unless she wants to live the rest of her life in Italy (which she very well may want to do), I don't think she should go to school there.  Part of me thinks she only wants to go there because of Andrea, but I don't want her to throw her life away for him.  I know she loves him, and he loves her, but I don't think they will make it together.  They may get married, but I think they would eventually get a divorce.  But maybe I just don't want to think about her with that fuck.  When we went out, she talked of going to school in BC, Hawaii, the maritimes, even Ontario.  Never in Italy.  I think her Italian friends put the idea in her head cause they all love her and stuff, but she should do what is in her best interests, not theirs.  So yeah, the e-mail.  I sent her the e-mail saying she had mail here.  I was going to e-mailing her on Monday once I get all settled in my new apartment.  It has been weird not talking with her and I miss her friendship.  But I sent this e-mail and it kind of sounds pretty cold.  I didn't say how I was doing, or ask how she was doing or anything.  Basically just said she has mail and that I hope she is doing well.  I don't really hope that.  I hope she is miserable and lonely without talking to me.  Selfish, I know.  So I sent her the e-mail, now I will see how she responds.  I will send her a real e-mail next week but I am not going to send her big long e-mails telling her everything I have done.  I am going to see how she responds and see what kind of relationship she wants to have.  I am not going to give her my address, or phone number unless she asks for it.  And I am certainly not going to ask her to hang out, no matter how lonely I am.  I would like to hang out and see her, but I don't know if I can handle it even now.  I am still very attracted to her, and I don't want to have feelings for her anymore.  The last few months were the hardest of my life, but once I told her we shouldn't talk for a while, I have been feeling like myself again.  I don't think about her all the time, and I really think we can just be friends.  But it will be hard and I don't know if there is a point since she will be leaving the Island next September for school.  But I do care about her and I want her to be happy, but I don't want her to be happy if I am not happy.  And I certainly don't want her to be happy with Andrea.  Oooh that pisses me off.  Anyway, that was a nice rant.  I don't know if this blog is going to have enough space for me to rant everyday.  This thing will be my only friend while I am in Summerside.  I am here until at least September 15, hopefully longer.  So be prepared blogger.com!

      This weekend is the big move to Summerside.  Should be interesting from here on out.  I will once again be able to sleep in until 7am!  That is quite exciting.  It is a pain in the ass to wake up at like 6am and then have to drive an hour to Summerside, then drive an hour back to Charlottetown.  It is like working a 50 hour work week as opposed to a 40 hour work week.  As soon as I get home after working, I am usually tired and hungry.  I watch the Simpsons, then Canada now and make some supper in between.  Then I head to the gym around 7:30ish and I have started jogging after getting back from the gym.  Then it is time for another shower, and by the time I am done of all this, it is 10:00pm and the day is done.  So it will be nice to have some spare time again, even if I am going to be all alone.  I had some troubles getting a phone number, but Aliant finally phoned me and gave me my new number.  They will also send out a self install kit for high speed internet, so hopefully I will be back online at home on Monday night.  If not, it is going to be a boring night with no cable and no internet.  I will have to check out Bad Santa, which I have been wanting to see for a while.  Haven't decided on whether to get cable yet.  I want to see how much the high speed internet and telephone are going to cost first.  I will most likely get cable, but I am going to try and go a week without it, see how it goes.  I am starting to get into Big Brother 5 at the moment too (yeah, I know it is terrible, but I can't help it).  This is the summer when I will finally get into really good shape.  Of course, I have been saying that every summer since like '99, but this is the year.  I went to the gym last week from Monday to Friday and I have already gone Monday and Tuesday of this week.  I also jogged both days too, so I am getting resistance training and aerobic training.  If that doesn't get me in shape, nothing will.  I am also up a few pounds to 162.  This is the most I have weighed possible ever.  I never was able to get past 160, but I am now.  I think I have gotten a bit bigger and I plan on getting more bigger by September 15 (the end of my work term possibly).  The weeks are actually going by pretty fast right now since I keep myself busy.  I don't actually hang out with my friends or anything, just work, and excersise and that pretty much takes up the weekdays.  My goal is to get to the gym at least 5 days a week, Monday to Friday.  Then I will be home on weekends and I will also try to go Saturdays if the weather isn't nice.  Then, I will take Sundays off and start anew on Monday.  Ran into my ex-girlfriends dad last night at Betty Bright off all places.  I thought there would be no chance of me seeing him again, at least not for quite some time, but I ran into him already.  I saw his truck while I was pulling into Betty Bright and I was kind of glad that I didn't drive past them.  Not because I don't like him or anything, but it would have been awkward.  Do I wave?  Will he recognize me in a car?  So I go into Betty Bright to pick up my pants thinking I missed him.  I look in the mirror and see the truck is parked in front of the store.  I see my ex's sister just sitting in the truck so I think to myself, did she just stop cause she saw me or something?  But then I look and see my ex's dad.  At this point, I really don't know what to say so I just say how is it going.  That never fails.  We attempt some small talk and I quickly exit the scene.  I could hardly talk to the guy when I was going out with his daughter, now that I am not going out with her, what the hell am I supposed to talk about??  The whole situation is almost embarrasing or something because you feel like such a useless dork, but what can you do I guess.  Her sister wasn't looking when I walked out, so I just went to my car and went home.    I don't like talking with her family members when they say "how are you doing?".  It makes me feel like I am some sort of injured puppy dog.  Yes I got dumped, and my heart was broken but I have since learned to move on.  Taking a break from talking to the girl you once loved really does help things.  And while I am writing, I should mention work.  I am finally learning a few things and I am not deathly bored today.  There hasn't been many clients in the last week or so, so I really haven't been doing a lot.  Everyone is on holidays or something, so the only thing I can do is read, or sit with another SDR.  Sitting with someone helps, but I need some real training here folks, or I will never understand this shit.    If you thought Paul Martin only slashed health care and social programs in the 90's, you are wrong.  Working for the federal governemnt, you really get to see how tight things are these days.  We can't be properly trained, and there seems to be changes and shortages everywhere to try and save some money.  I work at HRDC (now known as HRSDC) and for the last couple of years, the changes have been getting worse and worse.  Basically, some day, I think the whole employment insurance representative will be phased out entirely.  They already encourage people to file online (actually, that is the only way you can file for ei, regardless if you know how to operate a computer), and to phone the enquiries line if they have questions.  So in a few years, this position will be either greatly reduced (ie, instead of 3 reps, there will be one or 2), or gone altogether.  But hopefully I will be a permanent employee by then at least.

      If you have seen Anchorman, you obviously get the title of this blog entry.  I must say that I was quite impressed with the movie.  A few friends and I saw it this past Sunday in front of an almost packed audience.  Judging by the amount of laughing by the crowd, others were equally impressed.  In terms of comedic value, I would place this movie at the top of the list for this year.  Spiderman 2 was a better movie, but this was definitely funnier.  I have heard a lot of good things about dodge ball, but I haven't seen that yet.  Anchorman has some of the funniest moments I have seen in a long time.  Maybe I only thought that because Will Ferrell was in it, but I thought this movie was great from start to finish.  In terms of plot, the movie was obviously weak.  This is why I don't understand critics reviews.  Nobody was going to this movie looking for a compelling plot, they were looking to be entertained for 90 minutes and that is exactly what this film does.  Read some reviews by the critics, and they are bemoaning the plot, the story line, the acting, etc...  That was not the point of a movie like this.  It is a dumb comedy, and it knows it is a dumb comedy.  It is not trying to be a movie with a good plot, it is trying to be a funny movie and I think it succeeds on every level.    Anchorman is Will Ferrell at his best.  If you didn't like him before, you won't like him now.  The scene where he is wandering around San Diego with a big beard drinking milk is hilarious!  Let me paint you the picture.  It is scorching hot, Ferrell now has big bushy hair and a big beard because he has let himself go.  He has a 2 litre carton of milk and he is walking around town complaining of the heat.  He takes a few drinks and the milk is running down his beard and then he says something like "this milk was a mistake."  You really have to see the film to get it.  This is one of the best comedies in years and I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.  I will be first in line.  On a completely unrelated topic.  Courtney Love is once again in the news.  I guess she missed yet another court appearance.  What is wrong with this woman?  She can't make a simple court date?  The court date was in either LA or New York, and she was in the opposite city at the time.  Someone get her an assistant or something.  Or better yet, just throw her in jail or rehab and lets forget that she ever existed.  I mean, what has she ever done besides riding off of the coattails of Kurt Cobain.  Yeah, her first album was moderately successful, and she has acted in a few movies.  But the publicity this woman gets is way out of proportion to how popular she ever was.  So no more Courtney Love.  Please!!

      So Ken Lay has finally been indicted over the whole Enron scandal.  All I can say is, it's about frieking time!  He was the CEO of the company and there is no way he couldn't no what was going on with the accounting of Enron.  I am quite sure he realized what was happening.  I mean, how could he not?  He was the head of the company!    While Lay was encouraging workers to hang on to their Enron stock, he was trying to unload his stock because he knew that once auditors found out what was going on, Enron would be bankrupt.  He ended up making 90 million dollars from Enron stock.  Meanwhile, he encouraged hundreds, maybe thousands of employees to hang on to their stocks, knowing that once the accounting fraud was uncovered, the company would be ruined, along with their stock.  They should transfer all of that 90 million to the employees that lost their jobs because of the collapse.  Then they should throw Lay in jail, and throw away the key.    It is time to set an example for other CEO's in America.  If they know their books are being cooked, they should expect a lengthy prison sentence.  Kenneth Lay basically ruined the lives of Enron employees.  Those workers were counting on their stock to provide them with a comfortable retirement.  With the collapse of the stock, their retirements are ruined forever.  People are serving lengthy jail sentences in America simply for smoking weed.  That doesn't hurt anybody.  But the acts of Kenneth Lay ruined the lives for thousands of people and their families.  If he does not get a stiff jail sentence (which he probably won't), justice will not be served.

      Lots of news lately in the NHL, and none of it strike or lockout related!!  Of course, Ottawa is making the big news what with the recent trade of Radek Bonk, their decision to not offer Bondra a contract, trading goaltender Patrick Lalime, and now the coup de gras, the signing of Dominik Hasek.  I have heard people saying this won't work, and that Hasek is bad for locker rooms, but the bottom line is that the guy can play hockey.  Sure he will be 40 years old by the time he plays his first game for the Senators, but they got him at a relatively decent price and I think he is still hungry.  Just look at the Leafs and how well Belfour is still playing.  The position of goaltender isn't like it used too, you can play at a later age in nets with the same skill level these days.  I say good move on Muckler's part.  Now, on to the more important news.  I should clarify that my favorite team since I was in grade 6 is the Calgary Flames.  And no, I didn't just get into grade 6.  I have loved the flames since I was a kid.  So you can imagine how exciting spring was for me (well hockey wise anyway. My personal life was in shambles).  Well, the first player has bolted and I am shocked.  Craig Conroy just signed with the Kings.  I really thought Calgary would resign most of their key players with ease, and Conroy was a key player.  I really can't understand why he would leave Calgary.  They really had that team atmosphere and they have a great defensive nucleus.  Perhaps Conroy just wanted more money or to play in a warmer climate.  I am very disappointed in him as he was one of my favorite players on the flames.  Everyone moves on though.  The flames have re-signed Chris Simon and I think this is a good move.  He is a tough guy, and he could score 20 goals next season.  They also signed another free agent, but I have never heard of the guy.  If he has some skill, Darryl will be able to suck it out of him.  Could be a busy few weeks in hockey with the free agents all looking for deals.  But will teams sign very many with the possibility of a lockout?  Who knows, but we are all praying for the season to start on time.  And hopefully they will adopt all of those proposed rule changes, especially 12 inch pads.  This will help my team, the Flames, as Kiprusoff doesn't rely on massive pads to make the saves.  He relies on positioning and his flexibility.  Either way you look at it, this should be one of the most exciting NHL seasons in quite some time.

      So I am quite excited about this whole blog thing.  Whoever came up with this idea, I commend you.  Not sure how this website makes any money, but as long as I don't have to pay, I don't care how they manage.  I only wish I realised about this blog after my ex girlfriend dumped me.  I find writing really makes you feel better about the situation.  Being one who rarely describes my feelings, this is an excellent way to release some of those feelings.  It is very therapeutic.  But lets try and keep this thing fairly relevant.  Today, John Kerry anounced who his vice president will be if he gets elected to office.  The lucky nominee is Senator John Edwards.  He is from one of the carolina states I believe.  I think this is a great pick for John Kerry.  I actually wish it was more the other way around, but it is good to see that Kerry didn't bend to the right and pick a Republican to try to appeal to republican voters.  Lets face it.  Republicans are in love with George W., and they hate Kerry.  Putting John McCain on the bill would have only made Kerry look weaker in my opinion.  Americans need a genuine difference in the Oval Office, and offering a bi partisan ticket would not provide that difference.  There is hardly any difference to begin with between Republicans and Democrats, so the Democrats should go full out in offering a complete Democratic ticket.  I believe this is the best way to appeal to independent voters.  But in the end, it won't matter.  This is Bush's election to win or lose.    Bush's decision to attack Iraq may very well cost him this election.  I never supported the war in Iraq but if I were Bush, why wouldn't he have just waited until after getting re-elected to start the war?  He must have known that Iraq really isn't a threat to America.  If he had waited, he surely would have been re-elected.  His popularity was still relatively high, and the economy is improving, and that is the most important issue to Americans.  But, Bush decided to go to Iraq thinking he could win it quickly.  Obviously, the war has not turned out as planned and now Bush is in trouble.  The new Michael Moore film, Farenheit 9/11, is not helping matters either.  Although looking at the American news channels, they are more concerned about Moore's reputation as opposed to bringing up any of the issues he discusses in his movie (which I haven't seen yet, but will soon).  And that is what is wrong with the American media.  They rarely criticize the president, especially a republican president.  If you compare the media coverage of George W. to that of Bill Clinton, you will easily see this.    Thank goodness I am Canadian.  And if I had a vote in the upcoming US election, I would vote for Ralph Nader.  Speaking of voting, what are those chads that Americans use to vote with?  What is wrong with simply marking an X beside the candidate you wish to vote for.  This would make things much easier.  Then nobody would be looking for dimpled chads, hanging chads, pregnant chads.  How ridiculous was that whole recount anyway?  Did you see the people trying to determine who the vote was for?  It looked impossible.  Once again, that is another lesson Americans can learn from us Canucks.

      I'm am new to this whole blog thing, but so far it seems pretty easy.  Why not tell a bit about myself.  I live in Prince Edward Island Canada and I just graduated from University.  Received a double major in Sociology and Anthropology with a first class standing.  Sounds impressive, but isn't at all.  I came across this blog website after reading the weasel manor blog.  For those that don't know, that one is written by Ben Weasel.  Infamous punk rocker and front man for legendary punk band Screeching Weasel.  He used write for Maximum Rock N Roll back in the day too.  I was going to post a comment and I had to register so here I am!!  Once I get my home computer back on line, I will start actually writing in this thing.  I have a lot to say.  Topics will cover hockey, wrestling, politics, gambling, working, my beloved ex girlfriend, and drinking.  Not like anyone is going to read this, but it feels good to write it.

      It is Friday the 13th today.  Not feeling too scared though.  So far the weather is nice, but I guess it is going to be a rainy weekend.  Oh well.  I am glad to be going home this weekend.  It's been pretty boring up in old Summerside this week.  I talked to Doran for a few minutes and Scott on the internet, but other than that, I haven't talked to anyone.  Kept busy though.  Went to the gym after work everyday, went to Canadian Tire a couple of times due to a defective ironing board.  Aslo rented a couple of movies.  I watched the best of triumph the insult comic dog from Conan.  Very funny, but way too short.  The main part was only like an hour long.  Surely triumph has had more sketches on the show.  But it was funny none the less.   As for Eurotrip.  It was pretty bad.  I thought it would be much funnier than it actually was.  It has gotten me back in the mood to go to Europe.  As soon as my student loans are paid off (hopefully in 18 months), i'm off to Europe for a trip.  I would like to go over for like a month or something, but it will all depend on the budget, and where I'm working.  Hopefully someone will want to come with me, but if not, fuck it, I will go alone.  I've downloaded a few cd's this week from that supernova site.  It is wicked.  Got Anchors Aweigh from Bouncing Souls which is typicall souls.  Also downloaded to the nines by Only Crime.  This band features members of Good Riddance, Bane, and the Descendants.  I had heard a bunch of tracks before and thought it was alright.  But the cd is actually pretty good.  I feel guilty for downloading it, but it is only 11 songs, and I don't feel like paying 20 bucks for 25 minutes of music.  I also downloaded the new Rise Against cd, Siren Songs of the counter culture.  From what I have heard so far, the first track is one of their best songs ever.  The cd is kind of all over the map, but sounds promising.  I already ordered the cd, but it hasn't arrived yet, so I don't feel guilty downloading this one.  Nothing planned for this weekend.  Doran has a bachelor party Saturday.  Marc wants to go golfing.  He sent an e-mail to tell me not to be too hungover Sunday.  I don't know if he wants to go out, or if he thinks I am getting drunk.  I certainly up for getting drunk, hopefully some people will want to go out.  Gotta take the bus home tonight too.  It leaves Summerside at like 9:40pm, which seems like a weird time for me.  Should be home at like 10:40pm, then walk to my mom's house.  So I'm gonna hit the gym up after work, do the dishes, and clean the house a bit.  I applied to CRA today.  The online application doesn't let you really give much information.  It just asks what your most relevant job was to the position you are applying for.  I think I have had some very relevant experience, so hopefully I will hear something from them someday.  I don't know how long I will be working at HRSDC for.  As of right now, I am only due to be hear for one more month.  I am quite confident I will be extended, but once the person I am covering for is feeling better, she will be returning to her position, and I will most likely be let go.  It would be nice to have a position at CRA to fall back on, even if it is less pay.  I also realized something the other day.  Me and my ex let our guards down the other week, and we started fooling around for a bit.  We started doing some horizontal jogging and it just wasn't the same.  I didn't realize why until yesterday.  It is because I don't love her like I used too.  It is kind of sad really.  Fooling around with her that night was like fooling around with some girl you just meet at the bar.  You don't have any strong feelings for the girl at the bar because you just met her.  Well with Rosalyn, it was like I didn't know her anymore and it just wasn't the same.  It was like we were having sex, but not with the girl I used to love.  I will not tell her that, because I think it would upset her.   Speaking of Rosalyn, I hope everything is going ok with her.  I haven't heard from her all week, so I don't know what is going on with her.  Not that I expect her to check in with me or something, but we were getting along good again and she is going away on August 22.  So she is only near Summerside for another week now.  I know she has been extremely busy with school, work, and moving, but I figured she would at least send me an e-mail.  She rarely sends me e-mails, but sometimes she will send one saying she has been busy and hasn't been able to talk.  I am wondering if she is even staying at her cottage this week.  I miss her a lot, and after next week, I probably won't see her for quite some time.  We won't be talking with each other for like 3 1/5 weeks anyway because she is going back to the fucking shithole of a country that is Italy.  So if I don't talk with her next week, we won't be talking for at least a month and a half.  If that happens, I don't think we will be friends anymore and that kind of scares me.  But, if that's how it has to be, then that's how it has to be.  Why does be friends with your former love have to be so hard?

      So I am reading  urlLink www.punknews.org  and what is one of the headlines?  The guitarist from one of my favorite bands, Strike Anywhere, won the grand prize from Gillette for having a totally irresistable face.  Not only did he win 25,000 in prizes, but Anna Kournikova showed up at his front door to give him the news.  How fucking weird is this?  His girlfriend sent him a submission of him, without him knowing.  Then one day he gets a call saying he is a finalist, and he actually wins the thing.  They say he could also appear in an upcoming ad for Gillette, but judging by the lyrics Strike Anywhere sing about, that won't be happening.  But yeah, what a strange story.   And in other big punk rock news, NOFX were on Conan last night.  I taped it last night and watched it this morning.  They played Franco Un American, and El Hefe, Eric, and the keyboard player were wearing stop Bush shirts.  And Fat Mike was wearing a not my president shirt.  They put on a hell of a performance and changed some of the lyrics.  It was funny as hell.  The changed lines went something like this: "Don't anyone vote for Nader.  Our president is an imbecile, he likes Dick, but hates homosexuals."  How hilarious is that line?  He is referring to Dick Cheney of course, but you get the meaning.  They bleeped out Dick, but anyone with a brain knew what he said.  After the performance, Conan didn't look happy at all.  Usually he shakes all the band members hands, but he didn't shake Fat Mikes.  Not sure if it was intentional or not, but Conan looked pissed.  I was hoping there would be some mainstream coverage of it, but I haven't come across any yet.  Anyway, off to the gym soon!

      Another day is done.  Didn't really do a whole lot today.  Went to the gym after work.  Did some legs and back.  I really don't like the equipment at the Summerside AFC.  It is nowhere near as good as the Charlottetown AFC, but it appears to be the only gym in this god forsaken town.  Apparently some dude is in a standoff with police regarding child care payments.  No, no.  It isn't my dad.  He cleared up his child care payments.  Well, he didn't, but when I turned 18, they were automatically cleared up!  So yeah.  I tried going for a jog today too.  Then I quickly realized, "hey wait a minute.  I fucking hate jogging!"  But I did it off and on for like 20 minutes.  Maybe I should just buy some skipping rope.  It is better than jogging, and it certainly couldn't be any more boring.  Rest of the day consisted of the internet, and some television.  I wouldn't have been on the internet so much if my goddamn connection wasn't so fucking slow (no, I'm not bitter about it).  I signed up for high speed, but it is more like dial up if you ask me.  I've been downloading albums off of  urlLink www.supernova.org   what a great site.  But like I said, my connection is so slow that it takes like an hour to download an album.  Got Anchors Aweigh by the Bouncing Souls downloaded, now working on stuff by Strung Out.  I've got most of their albums right now, but I don't have Twisted by Design, or Elements of Sonic Defiance.  I had them at one time and I lent them to this retarded fuck.  They were "stolen" from him.  Yeah, sure they were Jason.  So I want to download those 2 albums.  Hopefully, that is what I am downloading.  Not much else to talk about.  I hate my keyboard though.  My hands are hurting after typing this relatively short message.  Also, the wet part of my bedroom floor seems to be expanding.  This despite the fact that I have had my dehumidifier running in their all day long.  I don't know why my stupid floor is wet, but it has been for weeks.  It is not just wet, but it is soaked.  It's like stepping into a fucking puddle.  I'm phoning my landlord tomorrow to see what the hell is up with it.  I'm really just killing time until the Strung Out stuff is downloaded.  Only 8 more minutes to go.  Haven't heard from Rosalyn in a while.  I figured she would have phoned this week or something.  She was supposed to have been moved out of her house on Sunday, so I figured she would be at the cottage as of Monday.  She sent a short e-mail on Saturday, but that was the last I heard from her.  I really got to stop sending her e-mails.  She never really replies to mine, but it wastes some time at work.  Perhaps I will concentrate more on the blogger at work instead.  It's going to be weird when she goes back to Italy.  I am not going to e-mail her then, and I don't expect her to e-mail me.  I don't know what will happen when she gets home.  I'm gonna let her contact me.  If not, then that will likely be the end of our friendship.  It's kind of depressing to think about really.  She was my bestest bud for so long.  But sometimes you gotta move on.  I feel embarassed even talking about this.  We broke up a couple of months ago.  It took a while to get over her, but I eventually did (thank god).  It is kind of scary being single at the age of 24.  You feel like you might never fall in love again.  Living in Summerside really fucked things up as far as meeting women.  The only thing I do up here is work, go to the gym, and get groceries.  I don't go out up here, and I don't have any friends up here.  Nor does it look like I will make friends up here.  Boy, do I miss Charlottetown.  The money sure as hell makes me happy!!  Goodnight blogger.

      So guess who is on Conan O'Brien tonight?  NOFX!!  I can't believe it.  I'm gonna set the VCR, and enjoy a nice live performance from NOFX.  Who knows what song they will play.  I am putting my money on Idiot son of an asshole (that's there unreleased track making fun of George W.).  Conan always has cool bands on his show.  So he is not only funny, but he has taste as well.  I remember when the Dropkick Murphys were on.  They performed blackout from their last cd.  Anyway, should be a good show tonight.  While I am talking about punk bands, let's talk about those political punks, Anti Flag.  I used to like them when they first came out.  I thought the split cd they did with DBS was pretty good (although DBS was the better part of that cd).  For those that don't know, that was Anti Flag's first release I believe.  It came out years ago.  I bought die for your government, but it didn't do anything for me and I haven't bought anything by them since.   Apparently they are being courted by the major labels.  There was even an article about it in the fucking Wall Street Journal.  How weird is that?  I read the story on  urlLink www.punknews.org , and of course, all the fans immediately start screaming sellout.   That term gets thrown about so much by "punks" and kids who think they are "punks."  It fucking pisses me off when these know nothing kids start dissing a band because they signed to a major.  It happend with Green Day, the Offspring, and more recently, AFI and Rise Against.  As soon as it happened, so called fans start screaming sellout and blah blah blah.  But why wouldn't a band want to sing to a major?  Not everyone likes touring in a fucking van playing in front of 150 kids.  A lot of bands are trying to make a living off of their music, and it is tough to do when you are on an independent label.  I mean, it is hard living on little old PEI and being able to get all of the cd's I want.  If I want a cd that is on a smaller label (like  urlLink www.g7welcomingcommittee.com ), then there is no chance of getting it on the release date in any stores here.  Sure, Back Alley can order it, but I would like to see it on the shelves somehwere.  This is the big advantage of majors, they can get cd's distributed better for bands.  Plus, they know a hell of a lot more about promotion, then some dude who runs a record label out of his apartment.  The above mentioned bands are not sell outs, they simply want to try and reach more people with their music.  Davey from AFI didn't start eating meat after signing a major, and none of the bands started playing pop music, so how can you say they are sell outs.  These kids who criticize the bands for selling out are either a) living at home with their parents and still in junior high.  B) working at McDonald's, or C) working at some other corporate job.  Some love their corporate jobs (and they work at places worse than fucking Geffen records), yet if a band signs to a major label, they are the sell out.  I can't stand kids like this, and whenever someone accuses a band of being a sellout, I immediately know that person is an idiot or a fashion punk.  They can't like a band if they are popular.  Well fuck that.  I hope the bands I like get popular, and continue putting out great records.  Tonight, watch Conan, download American Idiot by Green Day, and listen to some tunes.

      So I had just finshed typing up a new post when I accidently hit something.  Next thing you know, I'm looking at the google homepage instead of my recent blog.  That pissed me off.  You see, I hate my keyboard, and I hate typing with these keyboard.  It is uncomfortable, and I type a lot slower with this stupid keyboard.  So I wasted like 20 minutes typing out a nice blog about my weekend, Chixdiggit, cable and what not.  Now I can't be bothered.  The last thing I was talking about was music, so I will at least write about that.  I am currently listening too, and loving, the new Hives cd.  It's called Tyrannasouras Hives, and it is simply fantastic.  If I could be in any band, it would be the Hives (followed closely by Danko Jones).  Anyway, I just picked up the cd a couple of weeks ago, and it is going to have a nice home in my cd player for quite some time to come.  Also picked up the Velvet Revolver cd at the same time and I must say, the more I listen to it, the more I liked it.  I wasn't expecting much, I was just dying to hear a good rock and roll album, and that is what the cd is.  A good rock and roll album.   Yesterday I pre-ordered a couple of cds as well.  I ordered Rock Against Bush volume 2, and the new Rise Against cd Siren songs of the counter culture.   Both come out on Tuesday and I am looking forward to both.  I also heard the new Green Day single, American Idiot.  Good sounding track and hopefully the album will be equally good.  Apparently they describe it as a punk rock opera and they plan on playing the whole cd in its entiriety at future concerts.  I think that is a wicked idea, and hopefully they will come back to Atlantic Canada.  I saw Billie Joe and the gang (with the Riverdales as the opening band) back on November 1, 1995.  This was just after Insomniac came out and they were hugely popular.  It was also the first time I smoked weed (and inhaled too).  I was like 16 at the time and stayed at the UNB campus in Aitken house with my cousin.  Let's just say it was the funnest weekend of my life.  I was but a young naive lad back then.  Yet to discover the effects of alcohol, but boy did I discover it that weekend.  Good times man, good times.  And people are actually reading this blog.  How fucking weird.  I hope you people find something half entertaining on here.  But thanks for your comments.  Someone wrote about Chixdiggit and the Descendants.  I wish I could go to Moncton to see the chix's, but it likely won't happen.  I saw them a couple of years ago at the moncton skate park, so it is not too bad.  They put on a great show though.  But they haven't had any new material since then anyway, so I won't be missing too much.  As far as that new Descendants album.  I was quite excited as well.  Especially after hearing 'merican and getting the 4 track disc that came out prior to the cd release.  It is a good cd, but not as good as Everything sucks, but you can't complain too much about the descendants.  They are great pop punk and any band that sings about wearing glasses and reading, is cool in my books.  "Ain't got no biceps, ain't got no pecs. But I'll read you under the table, with my thick specs!"

      "After months of trying to figure out the where's and who's and how's, we have finally confirmed that we will start recording our next full length record in november. This bastard will smoke you fucks out of your holes. Good-night poser-bands of every genre. Nice knowing you."  Can't wait to hear this thing.  Propagandhi are one of my all time favorite bands.  I just wish they would put out records a bit more frequently.  I'm back in Summerside for the night.  Just ordered cable today too, so I will be backing spending some quality time on the couch.  It is going to cost me $77.30 to get it all set up.  That is $44.00 dollars for the hook up, and $21.00 for the first month of basic cable.  It ain't cheap.   Not much else going on.  No plans yet for the weekend.  I'm broke anyway, so I can't do too much.  Of course, I will scrape enough money together to get intoxicated, but that is about it.

      It is now August and the summer will quickly be coming to a close.  I'm up here in Summerside for the night.  Working tomorrow, then working in Charlottetown for a couple of days.  I wish I could work in Charlottetown a couple of times every week, but I can't.  Weekend was ok.  I actually don't like going to Charlottetown that much.  All I do is sit around and watch tv at my mom's house.  I went to the beach Saturday afternoon.  what a waste of time that was.  the weather was nice and warm, but the wind was so strong that it just sucked being at the beach.  it also completely turned me off from going to the toga party.  instead i went to stephen's and melissa's house.  it actually wasn't too bad.  we drank there then went to the lobster shanty in montague.  not a bad little bar, but montauge folks scare me.  i just keep thinking they want to fight.  we talked to this flames fan saying we were fans too, and he just kept looking at us like he wanted to punch our frieking heads in.  i wish i would have went to the toga party but doran wasn't going to go, scott wasn't going, and neither was marc.  brad and billie were, but i figured they would hang out with their girlfriends and i would be left alone at a huge party with a bunch of strangers.  plus i would have been stuck there.  i haven't heard how it went, but hopefully it wasn't too fun.  me and rosalyn went to dinner the other night.  we went to the deckhouse in summerside.  it was actually a really nice spot, and the food was pretty good.  after that, we rented butterfly effect and watched that.  the cable got turned off a few days ago, so the only thing to do is rent a movie.  we watched it, and it actually wasn't too bad.  then she said that she was scared to go back to the cottage because she would be alone.  i then offered to let her stay here.  she could take the bed, and i would take the couch.  of course, she wouldn't hear of that so she offered that we both sleep in the bed.  i said ok, and changed into pajama bottoms and a t-shirt.  i didn't expect anything to happen, but i was glad she was staying.  at first we had separate blankets, but we soon shared the same blanket.  anyway, one thing leads to another, and the next thing you know, we are going at it.  it was quite hot, but she started crying because she felt bad about doing it.  she doesn't want to hurt me again, and she is under the impression that i can be hurt by her again.  she did hurt me, but she won't be hurting me again.  i have moved on from her.  true, i still love her, but i also want to be free to do what i want.  i like to think that someday we may get back together, but i'm talking in a few years, not a few months.  there is probably no chance of it happening, and hopefully i will find someone else, but we made a deal that if we were single when we were 30, we would marry each other.  i would seriously stick to that deal, but who knows about her.  so yeah, it was an interesting weekend.  won't be spending much time in summerside this weekend.  doran talked about going to moncton this weekend with stephen and his friends, but i really can't afford it.  so who knows what will be going on this weekend.  rosalyn asked if i wanted to have supper with her tomorrow.  she asked last week, and i said i would like that.  don't know if she still wants too or not.  have to check my work e-mail tomorrow.  i think i told her i would phone her tonight, but i'm not going to bother.  i'll wait to read the e-mail.  bought a couple of cd's this weekend as well.  got the new Velvet Revolver cd, Contraband.  sounds like a very rocking release.  don't think it is a great album, but it is a good rock album.  also bought the new Hives cd, Tyrannosaurus Hives.  shaping up to be a great cd, and from what i have listened to so far, i would say it is better than veni, vidi, vicious.  have to give it more time though.
