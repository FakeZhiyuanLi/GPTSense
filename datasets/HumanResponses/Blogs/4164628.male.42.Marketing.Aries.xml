						    Yesterday Cora signed the contract to the house and we went celebrating in the evening having a great dinner. We both were sick last night though.. suppose that were the Vongoles (had tapas as a starter). If everything goes well (and we have no reason to doubt about it) she will get the key on the 30th of September. That is in about 6 weeks...  Yesterday, during dinner we talked about last few months, and how intense they were. Actually she said she would trade last 2 years for the last 3 months anytime. I feel the same. It has been an emotional period, and still is. But it has been a good time, being so open to each other and nothing left unspoken. I think we did it the right way. And now it is all coming so close it feels like we are in a "twilight zone". We can not even comprehend what it will be like, and that counts for all 3 of us.  We started to make a planning. Planning on the move of Cora, the things that need to be packed, cleaned out, and the arrangements for Lisa to come over here. Untill now we were not sure about any date, but now dates and times are involved it seems so much more real. Strange thing, time. October seems so far away, but 8 weeks seem so close. 12.000 miles seem so far away, but 13.5 hrs flight does not.       I once said ti Lisa: "The impossible I do instantly, miracles take a bit longer". And though things seemed impossible at the start, even in need of a miracle, it now comes down to just doing it. So as from coming week we are going to count down. Stay tuned!

						    Love is a drug, i am sure of that now (Thank you Brian Ferry!). Imagine what we all do for it. I mean who in his sensible mind would just leave his country to be with... well ok, it's me of course, that's a difference, but even so ;-). Love is a drug. The stupid grin on my face, the dreaming in full color, I even get up early in the morning to spend an evening with her! Now that does not seem a big thing, but believe me.. it is. That's a lifestyle change for me. But with everything you do, every letter you write, every decision you take it just feels so good. Another step towards being together. And thank you 10CC. Remember Lisa?

						    It feels like i have been asleep for years. I haven't, I know, have lived intensly, but dealing with mortgages, houses, so many decisions to make, it all feels like you suddenly woke up. And that's a good thing too. I just had a talk at my bank. They thought i was still selfemployed. So they must have lost track of me about 7 years ago. This kinda triggered the feeling.  I suddenly remembered that movie "Awakenings". It just feels like a fresh new start, a good feeling actually. I am really starting to enjoy it now. Not that i did not before, but i had a hard time allowing myself to feel good. But the good feelings are realy taking over now. Enjoying it!     oh.. lol just a note to go with that.. Have been on Red Bull and coffee most of yesterday after a night working and just 2 hours of sleep the whole day. now that must have had it's influence too.. Feel like ran over by a truck after sleeping for at least about 12 hours...

						     There is always pain in starting a new relationship if you need to let go of old ones. One of the difficulties is that you sometimes can not allow yourself to enjoy the excitement of the new one, the good feelings you have about all these things coming to you. It is not easy to hurt the ones you care about, but, it is something you just can't avoid. No need to rub it in, but it's like Lisa said, better do it anyway, it's like ripping off a bandage. You can't avoid pain, but it's even worse to let it last longer than you should. That's much worse. Going through the pain together is the best you can do.          As Lisa and I are getting so close to getting together we start to say goodbye in some sort of way to different things and people. That has a great impact. It is sometimes scary, sometimes just sad. Scary for example for Lisa as she is leaving her country to come here. Sad for saying goodbye to people you care about so much, or relationships changing, as with me and Cora or her and Doug. You let go of a way of living you're so comfortable with now. All the routines, the traditions, things that are done unspoken, feelings. It's a change process.           This weekend Cora and I sold our boat. That's like saying goodbye for both of us to a second love. Cora just bought a house and will soon be in the process of moving. So these are our last months together. Another goodbye. Lisa is saying goodbye to a lot of things and people, like to her very good friend Doug, and that will have even a greater impact as she will be so distant from them being here. It's a struggle. But what we always have to keep in mind that there is a reason for everything, and our faith and love will overcome these things. But we are ripping of a lot of bandages at the moment. It hurts.          Hang in there Lisa, Cora, Doug!

						    Strange. Sometimes i forget the most strangest things. There is one member of the family you did not meet yet. It's R채uber. Yes, that is a German name. Translates like rover or robber. He has been part of the family for so many years now. R채uber is our 14 years old black English Cocker Spaniel! He's deaf now, almost blind, but his nose still works like never before. Cora got him on the way back from holiday in Germany. She actually had two, one she left at her ex. R채uber is a sweety. Will tell about him more a lil later.

						    urlLink     Always hard to say goodbye to an old friend. Cora and I bought the boat 2 years ago. It has been like a second love for both of us. Now we are in the process of going our own ways we need to sell it. It's really hard, it feels like betray .  urlLink

						     A long time ago it suddenly occurred to me. Sometimes you just try too hard to do things right. This world is not perfect, and neither are we. My father always used to say: "Something worth doing is worth doing well". He expected others to be just the same. Needless to say he was disappointed a lot of times. It's the same with me sometimes. I just ask a lot of people, want it to be perfect. And I expect them to be as motivated and enthousiastic about it as I am... This drive sometimes leaves very little room for other opinions. That is hard enough when you are around me, but even worse when a few thousand miles away! Fortunately I am able to control this now, well... most of the time anyway ;-)          Why am i telling this? It has a lot to do with online relationships. You can share only a limited part of your life with someone else when online. You can't just go through your whole day, all the things you need to do, all the priorities, the daily work and routines. It would probably take as long as the day itself... So you tend to expect others to be as flexible and available as you are. I regret to say that I have been doing that as well the last few months with Lisa. Of course with all the best intentions, but it is just not right. You just sometimes have high expectations, without even being able to grasp how difficult that could be at the other end.          Example. We have 9 hours difference. So when she comes online, she gets a coffe, reads her offlines, her mail and starts to wake up. Fortunately we both are not real morning persons. But by the time she wakes up, I have had a full working day behind me and expect her to talk to me about things i have been thinking about, issues i want to discuss with her... Wow.. Can you imagine that before your first cup of coffee? Just recently i started to get up very early to be able to share her evening. Well that's a change for me! I need at least half an hour - 45 mins to really wake up, and she gives me all the time for it, patiently waiting for me to get up to speed. She's better at it than I am i must confess.           Another example. We do a Q&A through mail to ask each other some real important questions and get to know each other better. These questons sometimes take some time to think about. And then I have not even discussed the power failures she has been having that cause all your writing to vanish before your eyes! Well, there he goes again.. "Did you get my mail? Did you read it? Answer it? I did not get your reply yet..."           Man, i can be a real pain. Writing about it helps I suppose. At least I know that I do it, that's step number one. Just another lesson learned. One of my favorite quotes: "Did it ever occur to you that your purpose of living is to serve as a warning to others?" Now I did not write this post to stress that fact - I am here for another purpose I am sure. Yes, I have a strong drive in anything I do. Aries do tend to have that. It's just sometimes not very easy for the people I care about.            If you read this love, have a coffee, a siggy, hell, have 2 coffees. Wake up. Tell me to bugger off when you are waking up ;-). I will remember my own words.... Teach me a lil patience. Love you!!              Theo

						       You know how good it  feels when you wake up in the morning and the first thing you see is the one you  love? Well.. Just cherish that feeling. I had the same thing (more or less) this  morning. I got up early to talk to Lisa (9 hrs time difference..). My eyes were  still full of sleep, as i did not sleep too well. Actually i am a night person,  not a morning person. I went through my offlines, but did not even really  understand them yet, my brains were not into gear yet.&nbsp;But  then....&nbsp;WIDE awake all of a sudden when i&nbsp;saw her face on cam - no  coffee or Red Bull can have a bigger effect! Hardware problems prevented her  from camming a lot, I really missed her.. Felt so good this morning!! And doug,  thanks for the technical support ;-).

						     In every relationships, communication is key. It's so easy to be misunderstood! But when things are tense and deep emotions are involved, such as when you are getting to know each other, or when you are seperating, it is so important! It is easy to unintentionally hurt someone. You never intend to hurt someone you love, but you do. Little things can have such an impact. And often you just don't think it is that important, because your intentions are good and honest, but others feel that different. If you back at it, you understand, but by then it is already too late. You have stepped on someones heart. And by doing that you did not only hurt the other one, but you are hurt yourself too, knowing that you hurt the other.           I did that last night. The issue is not important now. I did not think right. I could have prevented it. And it hurt. Not only did I hurt Cora, but by doing that i was hurt too. First I just did not understand at all why she was so hurt. I mean, I did it with the best intentions, i was honest, respectful. But it did not feel that way to her. I felt so stupid!! Of course we talked about it afterwards and worked it out but it was just another example of how you sometimes mess things up when you are thinking too much of yourself, and not enough about the feelings of others.          I remember years ago I had a girlfriend, Greet. I visited her, all in good spirits because i had just had a great evening at work (I worked in a restaurant), had gone out afterwards end enjoyed myself. She sat outside in the sun, not looking too happy, and I just talked about how much fun i had the night before. It took me a minute before i suddenly realised that she was not looking very happy, and hurt. She had been to the orthodontist for serious surgery that morning and I had completely forgotten it. I still feel how stupid I felt, how mad I was I had just forgotten it, I could not forgive myself that I had been so very inconsiderate and self focused. There was nothing I could do to make it any better, I had done it.     I still feel that now, looking back at it. It creates a scar on your heart, and, much more important, on the heart of the other. It never heals.          In a normal face to face conversation you already have a lot of static. You receive whatever the other is saying, and interpretate it, influenced by the way you feel, emotions, and experiences. But at least you also have the help of body language, which can make up for the things you say, and help to deliver the messages. In chat you have just words. Sometimes not even a face to go with that, and if you do have it, it is normally just a bad small cam pic, that refreshes every second or few seconds without really showing all emotions, though it helps. Put on top of that the language itself (i mean I do understand English, but it is not my first language at all!) and the fact that written words can have so much more impact that just speaking (you can read them over and over again, and without knowing the intention it's up to you to interpret freely), and there you have it.... Miscommunication. And it's not easy to correct it either, because chat is also influenced by your typing skills and speed... Chat is an amplifier of misunderstanding.          Now what am I getting at is the following: I don't think I am telling anything new to anyone here. It is just that, whenever you really feel the need to discuss anything important with anyone, do it on voice please. It is so easy to hurt someone, and you will feel so sorry afterwards, but there is nothing you can do about it then. You got to prevent it if you can. Maybe when you have an important issue to discuss with a loved one online you will think back to what I wrote. And when you pick up the phone to call him or her, and work it out, you will know you did right. Just wanted to share. Online and offline: please keep talking.          I'm sorry Cora, I know there is nothing i can do to make it better. But I am trying hard.           Theo        added: Sometimes it is hard to keep a balance. This is a blog about Lisa and me, the things we experience, the joy, but also the difficulties on the way. In the past we had a lot of communications problems because of chat, and well.. it seems we are still having them now and then. That is what i wanted to illustrate. Now I upset two people over a blog.

						     Who are we? And why this blog? Let me start with myself. Theo - 42 years young. Born in amsterdam, I live in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. I work for a training company in Gouda (yes, where the Gouda cheese comes from!). I am responsible for marketing and innovation, which comes down to developing new training concepts. Our clients are callcenters, retail, ICT companies. We train commercial and service personnel in communicative and commercial skills, and combinations with product training. We have a vertical market in ICT (Information and Communication Technology), most big (moblie and fixed) carriers are among our customers. Ok. That's one part.          The other me. I enjoy sailing a lot! Done it since i was 8 when we moved to Lisse (many lakes nearby, so my father bought a boat). I am a good cook too, worked in restaurants for many years after I studies electronics (duh..). I just like to work with people. There is where my second hobby comes in: I do directing, theater productions. Currently for theater group "De Fakkel" (the torch) in Vlaardingen -  urlLink www.defakkel.com . Other than that i am an internet addict and enjoy all kinds of music. Made a few "the making of" websites for large opera productions and i had a world premiere of webcasting the first live opera in january '2000 - La Traviata. in 2001 I did Nabucco and in 2002 Il Trovatore. Links to those websites (with lots of pics, interviews in audio etc) can be found on my homepage  urlLink www.tekstra.nl . Sorry.. they are in Dutch!! And did I mention audio and theater technology? Well yes, everything technical I like too.. have my own audio setup for small venues, including wireless microphones etc. Will post a pic of me in the webcast room at opera in Ahoy later. I love my cats too! We have two maine coons, will post a few pics of them too.        And now my other passions... I have lived with Cora the past 11 years, but recently we decided to follow our own roads and break up. We still live together as i am writing this, but we are both looking for a new place to live, to start again. We are the best friends, soul mates even, so that makes it hard to do. But it just is the best thing to do. In March I met Lisa on the Internet. Actually i had seen her in a room before, but never got to pm her. When i looked at her profile one day I saw that she was interested in theater, so i asked her if she played as well (uhh.. in theater!!). We spent hours on-line, sharing music, getting to know each other. I kept a lil distance because, well, i was still with Cora! But by that time Cora and I decided to break up. Things evolved fast after that... I fell in love with Lisa and the rest is history as they say. She lives is SF, I live in Rotterdam. We are having all the problems of a long distance relationship, even though we already planned for her to come to The Netherlands. Can't wait! It's intense... But there is a time and place for everything. First i want to make sure Cora will be ok, have a place of her own, get settled. It has been 11 years.          I am not going to tell about Lisa, she will do that herself. So, we will keep you posted.. Love you Lisa!
