      Well last night was a lot of fun!! I got to see sammie (who i haven't seen in forever!!) and i got to hang out with Robin (one of the coolest Juniors...she's goin back to harrison :( but we'll still hang out!!) we went to her house and jung out for a bit with Matt then we went to Ross's house and played ping pong and watched the guys play video games lol and picked on Ross and Mark! then we went back to Robo's house and got a cup-cake and then went to Sonic and got a Vanilla COke and a large order of tator tots!!!! they were soo good but i had to hurry and eat it b/c it was passed curfue and i was prolly gonna be in trouble.....we were out till 12 and i was suppost to be home by 11:30 ooops....she didn't care though. it was cool everyone was asleep when i got home! I had a lot of fun last night just hangin out with friends...FYI Robin he is cute lol but kinda geeky if you ask me...he had the entire list memorized aw well it's cool!   Today i've done hardly nothing...i slept in until about 2:30 and that was good b/c i didn't get much sleep last night. i'm sore from working out and i was cramping BLAH....i hate being a girl when it comes to being on your period verses not having one like a guy. then i woke up and watched some T.V then i started cleaning my room....i didn't get very far until my mom came up and decided to take control...then she randomly left and i didn't notice so i got bored and came down here and got a bowl of chocolate cake ice cream!!! so healthy huh? well deal with it girls crave chocolate (or at least i do) when i'm on my period!   OK so 6 days til camp and i'm pumped....tmrw i'm going camp shopping and hang out with just my mom all day!! exciting (hopefully) I leave for Newton on Thursday and i'm soooo excited about that.I'm ready to see Richelle and the entire Britton family....b/c they are awesome!! OK well i'll get back with you later if anything interesting happens!  -Tori

      Well so far today has been a pretty good day! Me and SM kinda made up...i'm not completely sure....aw well we'll work it out (hopefully)!!! Ok so I went to church where i thought i was gonna be hounded on by people saying i hurt Cody.....and which he wasn't even there...which kinda shocked me b/c i was planning to talk to him and b/c i don't think he's missed church in a while. OK the 411 on me and Cody....as of right now we are over....but we were kinda talking i guess i dunno anyways....i really really liked him and all and i was wanting something out of it but then WAM came a ton of bricks (b/c like Alex said: everythings goin good for you. it's too good to be true right? well just wait it will come back and slap you in the face don't worry. Well FYI it did and it hurt big time.....i broke things off with Cody b/c things were happening that i didn't want to happen it didn't have anything to do with him or how he was treating me it was more so b/c i was having other feelings and b/c those bricks that hit me left behind broken bones. A lot of things started going wrong and i didn't want to pull him into it. So instead i cut him off and prolly hurt him even worse...and trust me i feel horrible so i let him down as lightly as possible...i guess i wasn't light enough...i feel horrible and to be honest i think i might still like him....i dunno for sure but i know that i miss what we had...especially our friendship....we don't even talk anymore and i'm kinda scared to call him (i dunno why though).   I'm leaving for camp in 7 days!!! YAY!! i'm sooo ready to leave this crap town...no offense to anyone i'm just ready to get away from all the drama! i get back on Saturday then i leave again on sunday to babysit Mark and Tammy's kids at Illiana! then i come home on Friday and leave again on Sunday for SITS then i come home on Friday and i'm home for about 2 weeks then i go back to camp on the 4th of July and get home on Saturday unless i go to MC to hang with those cool cats!!! Oh and more news..this week i leave on Thursday to go to Newton to hang with everyone there!! b/c Newton is the coolest town ever!! haha! love ya guys too! Anyways...i just talked to Tyson...what a great friend...he's workin at the put put place in Newton so i atleast get to go see him YIPPEE and i get to go to FLora IL to hang with Dave on Saturday for his party then stay the night there or at Molly's house and chill with them then head to camp which would be a blast!! Well needless to say i am VERY VERY VERY excited to get outta town and get my summer started...especially by going to Newton then Flora then OBCSC!!! the best camp ever by far...been going there since i was about 4 or 5!   Also another interesting tid-bit. I have a new crush but i don't want anything to happen in the love department until i am home for the summer b/c i don't want to accidentally start hangin out with a certain someone at camp...but my lips are sealed!!!! LOL well alright chew on that for a while and i'll get back to you later! have a god day everyone and have a great fun and safe summer!  -Tori

      i'm sorry...but 've noticed something that i really don't like and i think i'm goin to let you in on it....i hate when people judge me b/c i've gone out with a lot of guys....really i haven't gone out with a lot of guys b/c jr high really doesn't count....we are too immature to understand what we are doing and it's a retarded boyfriend girlfriend type stuff so if you would lay off b/c if you have problems with me and what i do confront me about it in person and not on here by being indirect and not letting me know who you are....it's rediculios...grow up....i hate being judged....thats why these days i don't tell people much b/c people are soo judgemental....i think i cna honestly only tell one or two people about my past and what all i've done without being judged by them and i'm glad i have them in my life....to bad they don't live around here.....evansville is crap...people here are soo stuck up and snoby...i wish we would move  it's sad...for the little time that i've been home...which is since saturday....i've already been judged poorly and looked down on....now isn't that sweet...i think not. I don't like this...my school is known as a school that doesn't care when actually we are the ones that care the most b/c everyone is always in everyones business and always judging people and i hate it sooo much....it can't get much worse...aw well...i've got my true friends behind me 100% and i'm glad to have em...all you other fakes leave me alone...thanks

      i'm home til tuesday afternoon.....tonight was fun....me and KK went to SNL for those of you who don't know is Sunday Night Live with CFC's high school group! that was a lot of fun! i got a lot of sleep today that i needed to make up but i missed church and i feel horrible about it.....i need to stop sleepin through church so much. Well last week at camp was awesome....even though there were only a few people there haha...it was good to hang out with Katy Walton and mallory Fisk they are  awesome people and Bobby came to visit.....i have a lot of witnessing to do....i've come to realization that i haven't been doing my work for Christ the way i should be and i haven't been setting the best example for my non Christian friends and i've noticed that b/c they kinda walk all over me and use me for whatever they can get out of me and drain me and when I am with them i don't act like a Christian....so i need prayer...i need to become a better witness to my non Christian friends this year at school and i need to date if and/or when i date, date a good Christian guy with strong morals and good standards. I know in the past i've slipped up a bit and fell on my face when i don't stick to what i need to in my walk with Christ and it is all coming to catch up with me....Bobby knows about this and quite possibly the only one who will ever know besides God and of course the people tht were involved....i have foresaken my king and Lord.....i need to want and desire him to always be in my life and heart...i'm strugling and being tempted by things and people....please pray that i don't fall into temptation like i have in the past...please help me to stand strong for my king and the lover of my soul. "You are the lover of my soul, Jesus i will never let you go." that's part of a song.   HUNGRY -title of the song....(i want to live this and have people be able to see this through me!) Lord I want more of you, living water rain down on me. Lord i need more of you, living breath of life come fill me up. We are hungry, we are hungry, we are hungry for more of you. We are thirsty, oh Jesus, we are thirsty for more of you, more of you. We lift our holy hands up, we want to touch you. We lift our voices higher and higher and higher to you.  if you would please don't ask me what happened in my past....if i want you to know i'll let you know....thanks  over and out TORI

      don't you hate when someone asks you to tag along when someone they know is going that would make the situation uncomfortable for you and they know it....arg thats why they do it so they know you will say no b/c they really don't want you to come but they feel bad for not inviting you b/c they've told you about it arg i don't like it at all and it annoys the crap out of me....if you're going to tell me about what you're doing and you know someone is going that i'm not comfortable around then why even bother inviting me b/c you know i'll say no....man ok sorry i had to let that out ARG alright i'm ok now

      well to those people who left those comments on my blog a couple of posts ago...i get what you're saying. I'm sorry that you think i just go for looks....i really don't....i mean yeah thats what firsts attracts me to them when i've never talked to them before...but the guys at Illiana are good friends that i'd never date considering most of them are in college but i did get to know them and they are all cool people then Ryan and Riley...yeah they are hot but i've literally known them all my life and the only reason i said that they are getting hotter everytime i see them b/c little RIley is growing up and i've gotten to know him a lot better and b/c Ryan and i have gotten closer and they are awesome people can i not say that they are hot without people gettin upset with me?! is that alright with you....trust me i've gone out with people who aren't cute but because i got to know them they became cute b/c of their personalities so stop accusin me for just lookin on the outside and not on the inside until you really get to know me b/c obviously you don't...actually i was just with a really cute guy and i broke it off b/c he wasn't my type! (we were talking so i got to know him....yeah so booya grandma) thank you!  Tori

OK so after that we went to the fair where i saw Levi and Mason. I also got to hang out with Ryan and Riley a lil bit that night....man riley's grown up a lot since we hung out last. Well at the fair we washed and fed Donna's pigs it was nasty smellin haha!!
