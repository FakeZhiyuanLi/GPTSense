       ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!  from a pretty good mood to a pretty bad mood geez i just typed up a 3 paragraph entry and because of my stupid downstairs internet connection its all gone... so sorry if this re-entry persay doesn't share the same enthusiasm as the one i had just typed up.  trying to remember what i was blabbering about***  oh ya its wednesday tomorrow meaning **dadadadum** FIREWORKS, haha enough hype eh, but honestly i think there a  tad bit  overated... not really in the mood to go but I WILL haha,, the one thing that annoys me about the fireworks is the marathon walking involved, lets say we go to 2 of the firework shows walking to english bay and back&nbsp;X2  &nbsp;i would say thats like walking from Surrey to New West,( or atleast it feels that way to me)  so ya good luck goes out to all you walkers tomorrow evening, cuz the next morning/s you will be sore and if your really unlucky you might just get beaten up :) j/k...  on the topic of special events i just realized that we are not good long-term organizers,&nbsp; i can't remember a time where we've planned out something a week or two in advance and followed up on it haha,, it seems as if everything we plan out is a day or two before it actually happens,,&nbsp; haha which causes some major planning cramming (if that makes sense haha) but ya i guess our short-term organizing style has worked pretty well sooo far  who else here is missing those&nbsp;crazy parties&nbsp;in the beginning of gr.10 (ie. choko's and tiff''s... more so tiff's for me haha) but ye we have to reinvent that theme we had going on haha.. i miss tasting all you girls' lips ;) haha... back to the basics: ALCOHAL, the fuel that starts my engine, the  liquid courage,  haha u know it, i was having this conversation with my older cousins and brother just last night, the term "liquid courage" holds true to its meaning, i swear all the Scarecrow needed was a shot of Crown Royal and all his fears would've been diminished... hahaha   just one more thing to mention...&nbsp;i have a&nbsp;Shaw internet connection between two computers (ie. wireless connection w/ router) and this downstairs comp that im on right now is seriously getting on my nerves, constantly logging me off and on on MSN, haha ye apologies to those annoyed people on my list.. and to top it off we called Shaw over to fix our problem,, and some guy comes over, and he has no clue of what to do... i couldn't believe this guy gets paid for a living, he came over and looked dumb-founded at the situation and i don't even think he touched our keyboard or mouse to try and fix it... end of subject, i've had enough already haha  imma boogy::   final note: please please pretty please can we recieve a boot my 6pm tomorrow

      Oooooookay...   So the time is 11:53 and&nbsp;right about now, the temperature is 22ยบ. I'm sweating so much. You know that feeling when you're done from P.E. class and you're sweating so much and you feel all gross and stuff, that sticky feeling?... YEA! i hate that. It's so hot that&nbsp;i wanna wear a speedo right about now...a neon green one.   So I just finished watching 'Boiler Room'. I watched it 3 times today; its so addictive. It's unfortunate that I didn't get to watch this movie before i got into telemarketing. This movie got me influenced into manipulating people and being a corporate gangster, LOL..I guess being a stock broker ties into telemarketing because it involves convincing people. It's all about salesman pitch, straight business.&nbsp;However, now i can't do that anymore cause i got fired...haha damnit! ...&nbsp;Whatevah! it's the summer, let's get crunk.   So, with that said...  Let's talk about summer parties shall we?   Yesterday was Bj's party, it was fun. Not as much people as i expected, but still pretty good. It's all about quality, not quantity right?  So yea i slept over. It was my first sleepover since like grade 5 so i was excited haha. I was too excited that i didn't sleep and i ended up jogging with James to Holy Cross and back at 4 in the morning and didn't end up sleeping until 11 a.m. When I woke up I had the fattest headache and i've been popping advil all day. But yea, i'd have to give it a 9 out of 10, Bj. Hope u find your hat.   But yea...   You know who i hate? Spiderman. I don't really know why though, but yea, yesterday i came up with a theory. Spiderman's only cool cause he lives in New York...wtf would he do if he lived in Saskatchewan. Seriously.   Well im out, I'm gonna try and watch 'Boiler Room' for the 4th time today. I wanna go for a world record. I doubt it though, i'm kinda getting tired of it and I'm pretty sleepy. I only got 5 hours of sleep today.   I'm out,  *yawn*   CHEDDA!&nbsp;

      3:15 a.m.   My thumb hurts...  I don't drink milk.  I think I have arthritis.   Currently listening to the Dj KaySlay "Pimp My Mixtape" Mixtape. Pretty tight, i like the 10 minute freestyle to the&nbsp;Deep Cover&nbsp;beat. I think Stat Quo or Game frees on it, not really sure. Nas rips it up with 'You Know My Style'. Nas is dope. He owns.&nbsp; Okay, so i didn't like Kay Slays last mixtape, but i've gotta give big ups to him. He's really pulled it off with this mixtape. Especially putting Ice T all throughout the mixtape talking about pimping--straight comedy, but he's so true. It's hard to explain, you just gotta listen to it.   Don't really know what to say right now but I'm gonna make an effort to put an entry everyday.   Let's see, what's there to talk about? Nothing really, I just basically slept most of the day, went to the mall, slept some more. I love sleeping, that's one of the reasons I don't want a job and also one of the reasons why im broke as fuck. Damn, i need a job.   I'm signing out for tonight, gonna try and drink some milk...  I seriously hate milk. You know what's worse?  CHOCOLATE MILK  or that strawberry nestle syrup stuff.  GROSS!   Peace,   CHEDDA!

         - This is  me      ARRITE..Its summer and this is going to be my first entry so gotta make it cool. its pretty late and&nbsp;Im&nbsp;one of the first to start this thing,&nbsp;kinda nerdish. Is this a journal?&nbsp;&nbsp;hmmm not sure if were going to continue this concept although this is kinda cool. We're a bunch of lil&nbsp;biters though,&nbsp;but i guess thats ok. everyones gotta bite once and awhlie.&nbsp;Anyways ...SURREY WHAT!&nbsp;im 16, i got my L,&nbsp;&nbsp;and girls suck. &nbsp;I kinda got my self into something and pretty much screwed myself over but its ok. It'll work. Cant really say on here&nbsp;because i dont know whos going to read&nbsp;this so maybe ill talk about it more later.. lets jus say theres 5 options.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyways..&nbsp; I love hiphop and it loves me.&nbsp;I go to fleetwood secondary school&nbsp;(honouroll student by the way..) and like to&nbsp;rock it freestyle.&nbsp;I like to be myself and think outloud. I might go to jh next year&nbsp;because im moving yet again&nbsp;but im having another get together this week. its&nbsp;going to be pretty much my last one. i hope i see girls wrestling in mud.&nbsp;drinkings bad im gona get fat. I want the bowflex. man i need to grow. i have nothing else to say but ivo told me to keep going. "talk about whats on my mind"..hmm whats on my mind.. pretty much this girl has been. she probably doesnt know. shes perfect..maybe too soon to say&nbsp;so maybe its jus a crush.&nbsp;haha man this is gay im gona stop now.   -surreysavages

       mmm eat eat eat...    i love eating!  (say that in a gay voice)      &nbsp;   ...But yea seriously, i need to gain weight. so i could turn my fat into muscle when i work out these sexy muscles of mine.&nbsp;I don't think i'm going to do that&nbsp;exhausting run anymore.&nbsp;By doing that i'll be losing fat and i don't like that and that'll defeat the whole purpose of me eating, like jabba the hut.       &nbsp;   Moving on...okay so let's talk about school --math for instance-- i'm glad i passed math even though i missed a hotel party which i heard was wicked hot but who cares, now i could go to a shitload of parties. RIGHT! Right? =/&nbsp;Well the parties i've hit this summer weren't alot but they were worthwhile...all i gotta say is that beach party numero 2... WHOA! * james we gotta get a permanent site cause we gotta post those pictures up.     &nbsp;  Okay well what are my plans for this summer you ask?   that's a good question considering the fact that&nbsp;I have a shitload of plans and&nbsp;I haven't accomplished anyone of them.  HOPEFULLY  (wink wink)&nbsp;we'll go rockcliming this week and yea chillitout. Who knows maybe we might catch a couple of snags with the fishing pole or maybe even get lost in the overwhelming amount of corn in the cornfields.    &nbsp;  Enough of&nbsp;this&nbsp;bland chit chat, lets talk about life?   Allllllriiighty then, &nbsp;don't you find it wierd how life gives you an plethora of twists and turns and all of a sudden, your well being could turn from sweet to sour. Wierd isn't it?   It's all about choice, life gives you a choice and it's up to you to make that choice, which could drastically change everything in your life.   I especially find it funny how life is humorous. It likes to poke a joke at you from time to time.&nbsp;It's funny how enemies could eventually become friends and devour that gangster image which we find today very childish and pathetic. It's funny how everything we thought was 'cool' turns out to becomes played out. That's life I guess. People evolve. It's Evolution. We've evolved from little kids who started summertime quarrels in the big VanCity to making songs on the computer which turned out to be a hit. =/ ??? haha. All i've gotta say is that we've come a long way and it couldn't have gone any better.    &nbsp;  Okay, now I feel akward and really damn gay right now but anyways...    &nbsp;   Let's drunk to the fuckin bone.     &nbsp;  I'll leave you guys with a quote...   &nbsp;   Learn as if you were going to live forever. Live as if you were going to die tomorrow.    -- Mahatma Gandhi    &nbsp;  I'm out, gonna eat. PEACE!
