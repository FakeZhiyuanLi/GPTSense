      today has finally come to an end! A new beginning for tomorrow! yeah. reborn once again. love this feeling. hohohohohoho. i'm gonna erase all the unhappy stuffs in my head. gonna go thru the usual routine AGAIN. haha.   i talked to riz online this evening. phew...he's ok. was worried he'll be very pissed off with me. thank god. was happy... However... i realized he's pissed off with 'someone'. not zin...but someone, his so-called buddy,X. riz thinks X interfered his life too much. i'm really worried conflicts may arise between them once again. i told riz X's trying to help him no matter wad. and that X treats riz like a buddy, that's y. really worried riz will argue with X. *keep my fingers crossed* pray that everything will be fine. all i wish for is to resolve the current problems and prevent more from arising. i know it's gonna be hard...but i know i have to go thru it. it hurts to see ppl around me leaving one by one or getting involved in many problems...just have to make sure i'm not there making things worse. yep yep. better stop bringing this damn thing up. haha.  my health is deteriorating...my cough is getting from bad to worse. gee. have to see a doctor tmr. MEDICINE...EEEWWW~~~~ no choice. it's already beyond control...the moment i breathe in, i'll cough non-stop...it's THAT BAD. argh. i'm gonna stuff myself with APPLES! an apple a day keeps the doctor away. smiles. haha. so lame. haha. hmmm...y a sudden urge wanting to eat CJ's strawberry pies eh? LOL. really damn yummy! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA... i love her butter cookies, pies, etc. hungry~~~~ *DROOL* haha.  well well...it's late. i'm tired too. so, GOOD NITE AND SWEETEST DREAMS~!!!! smiles :D

      sighs. it seems like problems are nv ending for me. i'm sorry... i really didn't want things to turn out this way...  the group had an outing yesterday. i went over to my hunny(zinmar)'s workplace b4 i joined the gang. got her a dolphin necklace. she loved it. haha. glad. Kel used CJ's phone to call me up. n as usual, the first thing he'll ever say is "TA MA DE.".yea. i'm very used to it. hmmm...i got there pretty late. so sorry abt it. got there and after dinner, they decided to go for pool. i talked to rizal about me n zin quitting. yep. i'm so childish to even think of that. i'm so irresponsible. sighs. it's understandable y riz got pissed. he got really serious in his tone. i was really afraid then. how i wish i could just run away. after CJ n jas talked to me...yea...they talk sense. haha. but it's too late. cos i've alrdy told riz abt it. n i dun think he'll wanna talk to me anymore...anyway, riz, we're staying. we'll nv bring up that stupid thing again. Boss sent me home after that. he's really nice to me. whenever i'm with him, i feel secure eh. cos he always say "dun worry, boss will settle everything.". haha. thanks, akil boss. huggles. he gave me assurance. i felt a whole lot better last night.   i woke up this morning. got online. was added to kel, cj, akil n jaisie's conversation. everything was pretty ok at first. but after all those poems kel wrote abt each of us, jokes aside, serious stuffs. kel kinda like blasted me. actually, in some ways, he's right. i was pretty lost, so i talked back. i was nv trying to argue with him or anything. all i simply wanted to tell him was that each individual has their problems. it's all abt each individual. but i think he's not willing to listen. dunno wad to do or say anymore. i was really lost...and in fact...really sorry and upset. i dun deny the fact that i was pretty hurt by wad kel said, "...the individual is u.". kel is nice n i noe he's always trying to help. so i kept quiet after that. i did cry. i'm not a crybaby,i cry only when i'm really upset or hurt. so i was indeed hurt. i was afraid cj will hate me for putting her thru these. but thankfully, she's doesn't. hugs for cj. kel's pretty pissed by me blasting him. he said he'll forgive but nv forget...well, it applies to most. i'm sure. i dun blame him. simply hope he'll eventually put it behind. thanks to kel, at least he cared to solve the problems. it's tiring to hate...i'd rather smile than sulk.  sighs...for each problem, it all depends on how u see it. and if u ever want all to think or feel the way u do, life's gonna be hard. so, when it comes to viewpoints and feelings that we can nv control, i always choose to advise then ignore. it's still up to that individual to love or hate, we can't force them to feel or think the way we want them to. talking abt love... i'm kinda like a fool in love. haha. zin's right, i'm unlucky with guys. haha. nvm, i'm waiting patiently for my Mr. Right.  :D  Gee...i wish for peace in the world. hopefully all the problems i'm facing will be resolved soon. PEACE~

      sighs. night classes today...cry.  &nbsp; hmmm...yesterday zin was asking me if i hate those 3 girls...i told her NO. i dun hate them. i'm already in a can't-be-bothered attitude. it takes a lot of feelings to hate someone...and i really dun hate them. i'm so numb towards everything. listening to F.I.R.'s   [our love] now. wad a meaningful song. i've been crying. at least crying made me feel better. i've been feeling very uncomfortable inside. dun feel like talking. been wishing to be alone lately. zin said i'm becoming too heck-care. smiles. guess so too. all i can do now is bury myself into work and studies. i dun wanna keep thinking abt my problems. there's too much for me to handle. how i wish i can find somewhere i can be alone, open up my feelings to. hasn't been to any green place lately. i need to. i love nature. it keeps me alive... &nbsp; i feel like i've been dead for months. i wanna do community service. be a volunteer. hasn't been doing that for quite some time. must do it again. smiles. only by doing that, i'd feel i'm living once again... &nbsp; gotta get going. cya...

      was told to meet at the audit at 9.30am this morning. got there and saw alot of freshies. haha. i'm finally a SENIOR! hohohohoho. the happiest thing was i got to see my hunny, Wendy!!!!! she looks so cute! as usual la. miss her so much! *huggles* was kinda excited at first...but after attending lectures n lectures...i'm dreading...lol. really tired. worse for tomorrow~ NIGHT CLASSES!!!!! we'll go home only at 9.30pm!!!! cry! sighs. i gotta work on wednesday still! been working so very much and i'm so very tired. money is indeed hard to earn. cry.   well well, met riz and boss in school today. riz seemed to be avoiding me. felt pretty bad. BUT i know i'm definitely not going back to the root of DRAMAs. i need some space to breathe. saw alot of new faces in our lecture group. some ppl changed eh~~~as in physical appearance. not really nice though. hmmm...my gang laughed at me~~~~they said tamagotchi's for KIDS. but mine's really CUTE!   i hate queueing up...so tiring. $30.10 gone...thanks to the modules' notes. sighs. those pig guys in my gang kept ogling at GIRLS. gee. guys ah...grrr. hmmm...dunno wad else to write. oh ya...was painting my nails just now. added some art to it. haha. nail art. i love it! lol.   erm erm...really dunno wad to write. oh, so sweet of my hubby to carry my heavy notes around. lol. thanks thanks. oh ya! stupid zhiwei kept teasing me since the moment we met this morning! argh. *kick* hmmm...looking forward to a date with SOMEONE(an idiotic pig who makes me hate and love him) this friday! lol. he's gonna buy me a pair of shoes. so happy!   [anyhow...i dunno if i am with him or not...i dunno if i still want to or not. i noe i need a special someone to lean on, but i dun trust anyone anymore...sighs. i dun see the future in us. i am realistic and i have to be. LOVE is not everything...we need many other more factors to survive in this world, esp. in Singapore! i do have feelings for him...and it's alot. but i dunno if it's still LOVE. i'm so lost. it's either i choose LOVE and might have to suffer in the future OR i choose the FUTURE and dun have love. life is always so full of choices and we have to make so many decisions. even when we dun wanna think about the problems, we're forced to face it and make a really difficult decision. FLY AWAY~ that's wad many ppl yearn for...i believe. i'm not being a desperado...i dun yearn for LOVE, i noe it'll come my way when the time comes. BUT sometimes...i wish it'll come by sooner...cos it's really tiring walking this journey alone...sighs. still, a wish is just a wish...]  good nite and sweetest dreams to all... peace.
