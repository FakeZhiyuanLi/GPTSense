        Heavy metal!&nbsp; You rock!&nbsp; It's mostly about the music instead of lyrics for you...but you channel most of the emotion through the lyrics! Mosh pit for you!&nbsp; Just be careful you don't give yourself a concussion with so much headbanging...   urlLink   What genre of rock are you?     brought to you by  urlLink  Ya so I was hanging out with Brittany, Spenser, Tina, Rachel, and Ervin today...Kathleen to but not until later.&nbsp; and we went to the lower dam and started walking around and shit and me and Tina had been fighting for some crazy reason like physical (just play slapping or hitting with grass stuff) and she yelled because she slipped into the water a bit and so I yelled "it wasn't me" because according to Brittany and Tina I was being "sick" today and somewhere between the yelling and "it wasn't me" she yelled "I'm wet" so again I was being sick and Tina decided that I was rape....not a rapist, not getting rape, I'm just the human incarnation of rape....I'm still not sure exactly what that means but it's...different. anyway it was a good day...AND I GOT JELL-O. only problem is i have to eat it tomorrow when spense, and brittany eat there's but they have the Redi-Whip so i don't get any :( it's so sad. but i'll get over it XP well i'm gonna head to bed because I'm bored so i'll talk to you later and Hi brittany i meant to post it on your site deally but as you can see...I forgot...sorry i'll do it eventually

      ok so some people say i'm a "man whore" or "pimp" but these are simply un-true statements...I just have a lot of me to go around... Spense: "You know the nazi's made the jews wear pieces of flair." anyway I had this really sweet quote that i said when Spenser and Rusty were here so I'm gonna tell you about it because it's damn funny...or i think it is and so does Spense and we're funny... Rusty: wtf. Spenser:&nbsp;lol...omg Steve: what the fuck, hahaha anyway the thing i came on to say is that I think that I'm going to dump kenzie and go for Maureen...you know what i'm talking about Kathleen go and ask her!...ya anyway so me and spense are gonna hit the...um...sack...and so on so we're going to sleep and listening to the Wicked soundtrack...and if you haven't heard it you NEED to!!!! because it Roxors!

      Well guys i'm here Sniper Steve, Steve, Steven, Steve-O...the list goes on and on.&nbsp; Anyway I've been bored as hell here just got undrounded. First thing i did, go to the drive in! ya...good times.&nbsp; I rode up with Ky and then we were in last in the "caravan" it was sad...but we passed people so it was ok.&nbsp; When we got there kyle did a crappy parking job so i went to fix it...but then we found out that stupid kyle overheated his engine by having the A/C cranked and the gas pedal floored for way to long.&nbsp; So we "worked" on it for like half an hour and I was saying it's over heated like the whole time but no one listened because they're all dumb!&nbsp; anyways....I Robot rules the world! everyone needs to see it.&nbsp; It's totally linked to the Animatrix wethere they like it or not.

      YAY!!! welcome home nick and by the way i know Montana sucks...anyway today was a good day i got up nick showed up i got dressed for paintball and we headed out for kyles to pick him up and go.  so on the way "to kyles" nick decides that he has to take a right turn on to Falcon from Wasson at like 25 at the last second so we go come about 1 foot from hitting a stop sign and then about 3 from a tree, the tire came off the rim and nick and Slingshot (david my little brother) put the spare on and then we headed to kyles long story shot we went to hudson fixed the tire went to the paintball store got pain and CO2 refills then went off to paintball which I did pretty good at with a 4-3 kill ratio...or something like that unfortuanatly slingshot got me with the slingshot the first round so i had to yell "I SUCK" and switch teams which sucked but it wasn't my fault i was busy paying attention to Jake (that's his name i think) and Nick who had GUNS on either side of me. anyway that was fun no sticks in anyones head. then we headed to Steve's Pizza where we were saddened because we learned that the cool waitress is leaving soon and we'll never see her again...she also gave us our pop for free because nick and myself commented on how we liked the bill before she put the drinks on (the pizza we pre-ordered so she just added to the reciept) so that rocked. then we went to rachels (sp?) and hung out there...by the way rachels (sp?) dad rules. anyway that was fun but we had to leave so we dropped off kyle and nick took me and slingshot home where i played and defeated with my 1337 "ribbon" skills Ace Combat 04.

      ok now i don't want to be mean but Spense you're being a fucking bitch my sister would suck it up better than you are we've been friends for a long LONG time but i just don't think with you acting like this that i want to keep our friendship going because you keep thinking that you're the only victim all the time sure you're sorry for what you did to Ky but you knew you were doing it you say that extreme happieness clouds your judgement that's bullshit because you said yourself you knew what you were doing you just didn't care and that pisses me off because you're better than that you aren't the kind of guy to be a bitch about stuff.  Also you say we ditched you I don't see it that way because you went off with Rusty you never said hey are you guys doing anything becuse i've got nothing to do but go home or something like that you just expected us to invite you which sounds like a Kenn thing to do (no offence but Kenn you gotta call people up if you don't want to get "ditched") if people want to do stuff then fucking CALL or TALK to people about doing stuff esspecially when you KNOW THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING.  on a totally different note I forgot to call my ex-girlfriend for one day now even though i said i would call her back tomorrow (which would have been today) and i feel really REALLY bad about it because i really meant to call and talk to kenzie but i totally forgot because i got up at 5pm. had a few "chores" to do and then my mom got home and i had to go get the lawnmower and decided to have spense over for dinner sense i was going over there anyway so then i ate and had to rush off to a play that me kathleen and molly planned on seeing (i only say those three because spense went with keli and other people that wanted to go...didn't) My Fair Lady which is really good and when that got out it was pretty late and i couldn't call her then so all in all it sounds like one big excuse but i really did mean to call so if you ever read this kenzie i'm really sorry.  and if you notice any grammar problems please post a comment and i'll think about reading it because i don't use punctuation and i suck at english but i read damn well.

      I do have a soul...it's sad...but i guess I'll get used to it. Also now having a soul I can say this. Well use these lyrics  Artist: Slipknot Album: Iowa Title: People Shit Text: Here we go again, motherfucker  Come on down, and see the idiot right here Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care What's the matter with calamity anyway? Right? Get the fuck outta my face Understand that i can't feel anything It isn't like i wanna sift through the decay I feel like a wound, like a got a fuckin' Gun against my head, you live when I'm dead  One more time, motherfucker Everybody hates me now, so fuck it Blood's on my face and my hands, and i Don't know why im not afraid to cry But thats none of your business Whose life is it? Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it? Spin it around so i can spit in its face I wanna leave without a trace Cuz i dont wanna die in this place  People = Shit People = Shit (Whatcha gunna do?) People = Shit (Cuz i am not afraid of you) People = Shit (Im everything you'll never be) People = Shit  It never stops - you cant be everything to everyone Contagion - Im sittin' at the side of satan What do you want from me? They never told me the failure i was meant to be Overdo it - dont tell me you blew it Stop your bitchin' and fight your way through it IM - NOT - LIKE - YOU - I - JUST - FUCK - UP C'mon motherfucker everybody has to die  People = Shit People = Shit (Whatcha gunna do) People = Shit (Cause im not afraid of you) People = Shit (Im everything you'll never be) People = Shit  this isn't always true but some times...this song just fucking clicks. anyway I'm gonna leave this at that and post tomorrow...I think I'm gonna use this more than anticipated.
