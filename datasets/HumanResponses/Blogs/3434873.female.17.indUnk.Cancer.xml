           Today is my first REAL post.  Andy did the other one for me.  Anyway, I am not a guest like andy was at jeffs im a CO-AUTHOR just so anyone reading this knows.  Oh, and if you think its silly that my bf and i are sharing a blog or mushy oh well.  I don't know how much it will get updated though cuz neither of us does a good job of that as you will see from the other ones if you go there.  In any case, I'm very excited because I have less than two weeks of school left and then it's summer and I get to leave for Europe and Virginia and Em is getting married :)))) and chicago, etc.  Also time with friends and things.          Right now I'm kind of depressed.  I don't know why.  I guess school can't end soon enough.  I hate acting like a stupid kid drooling over the highest grade so I will get into some great college.  I want a lot more.  Anyway, it rained yesterday! I love the rain :)        Alright that's about it.  Adios.

      Yikes so today was basically the count down. The review give out. The begging of the end of the school year, dont' worry i am pretty sure that the end of the world is at a later date. Only God can tell though. SO anyways i was completely unprepared for today, all i did last night was a art project, which was due last quater i might add. I ABSOLUTELY MUST finish my english paper due last wed or friday and i must finish an extra credit deal for mr. donahoe (the 92cent meals). Yep so i basically ate like a person on welfare would for about a week. It wasn't that bad acutally. I had peanut butter and jellly for lunch, ramam  noodles, eggs for breakfast, pretzels, and tv dinners oh and i had a few apples. THis is not that bad of a meal. THe only problem i saw was incoporating a full healthy diet. I added up all the calories and i found that i was being malnurished. I was only getting about 1800 calories a day. If i was doing water polo or swimming during this, i don't know waht would have happend to me. I suppose i would have withered away because of the intense exercise and not enough food. I ended up lossing about 5 pounds, but i believe it was in water weight.   LAtely i have been exercising a bunch, getting ready for Philmont, swimming, water polo, and stephie. (she's got to have a some what muscular person) Well i hope she would liek that i am trying to build muscles become leaner, etc. the "buff guy" maybe even the "ripped guy" who knows or i could jsut be andy the swimmer. or just andyswmr. Good stuff .   Right after i print this bad boy blog stuff out, i am goign to julies and help my dad with building her dad's ramp. He had alittle over half his leg amputated. So he's in a wheel chair, cruzin around. good stuff. I always wanted to see what it was like having to rely on a wheel chair. I don't know if i would mind having my legs crippled. I would porbally go into that wheel chair racing stuff. Looks really fun. ANd ur arms get really ripped from rolling yourself around.   Yep oh oh and i got my prom pictures which after we work on julies dad's ramp, i will proceed to stephanie's to show her the pictures and proablly give her most of them. I can't believe i spent 60 bucks on pictures. They turned out pretty good so that worry is gone. But now i just have like a bagillion pictures, and a couple ginormus ones. I think i will have mine framed or somethign of the sort.   Well i need to go turn this in, adios

      Anyone who wants a link from our page, please tell me and we will see if it is acceptable.  I figured it out. Wow u know html is kinda easy. you need to know the basic commands but like if u set up a item to be a certain size color etc, you can use the same settings for it by using the same tag for it.  I noticed that most of the blog template is a bunch of tags leading from one set to the other. I am pretty sure if i wanted to change the size, color, font. i could it might fry my brain alittle, but i could do it. HA YAY for me, thanks jeff for the assitance that u didn't really give me.   I love stephie

      I think i figured out what was wrong, and fixed it. Now stephie's name shows up when she blogs and my name shows up when i blog. Um the only things left to do are to add links and change the template. I have to say i am working on learning all of this stuff.

      So its about 12:04 Am. Its just tomororw right about now. I just took a run to burn myself out for sleeping. Today was lots of fun. I finished my sculpture in art and that felt wonderful. Like freedom from art. I am not taking it next year so that makes me happy. I can go create, imagine, design, love, and be happy without getting a grade. This is today which means that I have been going out with Stephanie for 4 months. Great times, I Love Stephanie. I have never felt like this for any other girl. Just soo happy, carefree, lost in love, Nothing can stop me when I am with her. I feel like just wow. I love her.   SO tomorrow is today which means there are three water polo games today and I intend to go to one or more of them. I know that I haven't shown up for any of the other games or any practices which is fine with me, I just hope that they will let me play if I show up. I am listening to this dude's songs. Very good. Completely unexpectedly good. And just very cool.  Kinda weird when I know that this person is kinda close to me, in a way that idk is ok. I am kinda afraid of the future. I don't' like knowing what will happen and what won't. I want to shape my future into what I see and want right now. But that's just not acceptable to HIm. He will direct me in ways unknown, He will guide me, I wish and pray for this girl, I hope He will direct her, and guide her, along her way, close to me, next to me, with me. I hope our paths are entwined to no end. As it was Said by Queeny "God is the ultimate wedding planner" Very good stuff that is. Anyways I best be going. Tomorrow, I mean today is upon us,  !!! I love Stephanie, PALABRA(word)

      yay! summer is here! i'sa so HAPPY!  on the last day of school, last friday, andy picked me up from school and we went to see Harry Potter with his little brothers.  Then we went to the Cardinals game- my first baseball game of the season!  It was so much fun and we won!  Andy didn't know too much about baseball which I found funny.  Anyway, then Saturday I went to Emily's bridal shower :) so cute and Andy and I went swimming and Saturday night I went to the mall with Kara to look for stuff for Europe and we went to see Raising Helen which was very good and funny.  Then Sunday I went to church which was so much fun!  And then Jen and I went bike riding at Creve Coure Park AWESOMENESS!  my chain pulled off though so we had to put it back on and get all greasy and oily and yucky :) yay.  Then when I got cleaned up I went to Adam's graduation party which was also fun and then later Andy and I went to see Mean Girls.  Andy's so cute.  He showed up in baggy jeans, this shirt I gave him as a gift, and hiking boots cuz he's getting ready for Philmont.  He looked HOT.  Anyway lol BUSY weekend.  Yesterday I went job hunting and looked places for apps and filled them out and did some interviewing to get a job.  Stephie's growing up lol.  Then once again I went to see Harry Potter with Andy and my parents.  I want to go see it again if I can go to the OmniMax.  Anway, on Friday Kara and I leave for Europe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I saw Emily at the movie theater last night and we talked about the trip.  It's gonna be awesome!  I can't wait!  London, Paris, Florence, Rome! mmmmmmmmm :) yay!  I will blog again either before I go friday or whenums I get backums.  Love ya. Stephie

      SO this is the first time I have blogged in about a baggillion years. SO I went to philmont, and came home, and started working on my eagle scout project. Lots of stuff has been going on.   The new house's roof is slowly being constructed. They ordered the wrong size of rafters. They were supposed to be 2x6 sizes but they gave us 2x4 sizes. They are stupid and its taking longer to construct.   IF you don't' know I was in a car accident. I am fine. No one else was involved. The car is undrivable at the moment. IT was purely accidental. The car started to hydroplane and we hit the median twice and rolled off the road. Good times...  I can't wait for tonight. WE, stephie and I, are going to the baseball game. It's going to be lots of fun. TO the baseball game.
