      My neat son just called me from DC to hear the horses hooves as the processional carrying President Reagan's body went past.  It was strange because I was watching it on TV and they were going up a tree-lined path at the Capitol Bldg.  When I called Steve back, he told me he was under the trees, away from the crowds.  He's off to get in line for the viewing.  What tales he'll be able to tell is grandchildren!

      I am sad over the loss of President Reagan.  I believe he was just one of us who went on to change the world.  I wish only the best for his family.  I pray they may get through this sad time and know that the nation truly loved and appreciated him.

      I had to create this to be able to respond to my son's blogs.  I hope I remember my address so I can come back and add more!

      Never paint your living room because it's never as simple as that.&nbsp; This past spring I decided to paint the grungy, fireplace smudged walls in my living room.&nbsp; So once summer came, and I had time to actually paint, I proceeded to my nearby paint store and brought home the pre-requisite 55 paint sample sticks.&nbsp; Needless to say, I could not decide which color to use, so my mother suggested I call a designer who could come up with a plan for my living space that I could work toward in order to have the Martha Stewart room.&nbsp; I met with Donielle and she said a plan would be ready within a week.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;I needed to paint the walls, but Donielle was still planning my room, so I called her twice and finally pinned her down on a color , which turned out to be a two color, ragged-on paint application in my lovely large 25 X 14 room.&nbsp; I worried and fretted over this two step process, until my sister finally showed me how this was not brain surgery and I could always re-do anything I messed up, so one week later my walls look great, but unfortunately, this aggravated my carpal tunnel symptoms, so now I'm looking at surgery sometime in August.&nbsp; Anyhow, back to the living room,&nbsp;&nbsp;I have now waited four weeks, and have no plan from Donielle, BUT my mother suggested I change the carpet to a lovely green.&nbsp; I did, and she was right!&nbsp; And not because she is always right, but this time she is actually right.&nbsp; Because the carpet is green and the walls are a darker shade than before, I need to change the curtains, and buy a new beige leather chair, as the blue stuffed chair I have is too dark, add a ficus tree in the corner, and order an upholstered bench for under the window.&nbsp; Oh, and because the living room is&nbsp; connected to the kitchen, I'll need to change the wallpaper in there, because it has no green.&nbsp; When I moved the furniture into the kitchen to have the carpet installed, my linoleum stretched, so now I need new.&nbsp; I'm thinking a wood laminate might be nice.&nbsp; Also, my foyer now seems too light, so I'll probably have to hire a painter to paint it since I cannot reach up into the stairwell to paint.&nbsp; So, like I said, never paint your living room.
