 Your element is Darkness: Self centered, strong
 willed, mischievous and mysterious. Your quite
 dark and often times frightening, although you
 may be good looking its just a costume hiding
 the darkness of your heart. You detest everyone
 but yourself, people are simply insects to be
 burned under the power of your magnifying
 glass. People are somewhat drawn to your
 mystery but find out to little to late how
 cruel you can be. But you have a passionate
 soul, that is unless you already sold it.
 Pursuing whatever you set your mind to, you
 look at life with a 'Shut up and leave me
 alone' attitude most often because people
 generally seem to annoy you. You may be the
 ruler of darkness but you can often times be
 generally lonely wishing for someone to share
 in your dance of darkness so long as they know
 who is the master.

 Ok... that's kinda true... You may not know it but I keep secrets... Nobody actually knows me that well... Or maybe you know half of me...? Whatever... But they do have some wrong info there. For instance, I don't love myself. I actually feel the opposite!
 
 
  
 You are Pluto...Abuse of Power, Darker side, Spiritual Outlook.You are associated with spiritual changes, development, and political power. Under the strong influence of this planet you will
 experience rebirth (transformations and regenerations of both the spirit and the mind).Pluto's energies are intense and when unleashed it can actually change your entire life, for good
 or evil, so much so that you seem caught up in a whirlwind until the phase passes and leaves a
 complete set of new ideas, ideals, or morals instilled in the very core of your being. It
 also has a purifying energy that allows you to rise to higher levels of awareness. Before this
 rise can come about one must consciously seek to eliminate anything that would hinder you.

      Here's something funny that I thought was hilarious, mainly because I was taking chemistry during the time I recieved this in my inbox as a forward. I just now found another copy of it at this web site:  urlLink http://www.ryanjoseph.com/~dgale/hell.shtml  . LOL And to think... My chemistry teacher offered extra credit if I could continue on with the explaination! YEAH RIGHT! LOL I can't do anything in chemistry the right way (except titrations...!) Well... I hope you enjoy it... that is, if you can understand it. And if it does offend somebody (I don't see how though...) I am sorry but you should take it up with somebody else... say... oh, I dunno... the guy who wrote that in his exam...? That sounds good to me. I really don't need the extra stress! Thanks!
 
 
   Exo or Endo?
 The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington Chemistry mid-term. The answer was so 'profound' that the professor shared it with colleagues, which is why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well.   
   
 Bonus question: Is Hell exothermic or endothermic?
 
 Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law, (gas cools off when it expands, and heats up when it is compressed), or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:
 
 First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell, and the rate they are leaving. I think we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.
 
 As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of that religion, you will go to Hell.
 Since there are more than one of these religions, and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project then that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.
 
 Now, we look at the rate of change in the volume of Hell, because Boyle's Law states that, in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:
 
 If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.
 
 Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature will drop until Hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Teresa Banyan during my Freshman year - that "it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you" - and take into account that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then it cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic, and will not freeze.
 
 The student received the only 'A' given.

 Um... I care about alot of things! LOL Whatever...
 
  
 You have a Lost Soul. No one is really sure what
 that can always mean, because it can be defined
 in many ways. As Legend goes, lost souls were
 the spirits of passed away people who are
 neither in heaven nor hell. They walk the
 earth, brooding mysteriously, always appearing
 when you expect it least. So hence, if you have
 a Lost Soul, then you are probably very
 insecure and shy. Stuck in your own little box,
 you watch the world fly by as a loner. You dont
 know your place. You seemingly dont have a
 place in society or an interest. You are a very
 capricious person, and are confused and
 frustrated about where you belong. You crave
 for the sense and feeling of home-but have not
 obtained it yet.
