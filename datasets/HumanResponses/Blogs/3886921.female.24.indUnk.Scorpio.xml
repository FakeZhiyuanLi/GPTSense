      Ok i have NO clue what to write about...Im just doing this cuz i feel like I have to. Um...i went to walmart today...WOOoOOOooOOhhOOooOo! Had to buy cleaning stuff to clean the bathrooms. Fun. Then i got Arjuns haircut...then went to toysrus. My life is SO interesting. As I sit here and wonder if this skirt im wearing is TOO short....im also wondering who the hell is gonna actually read this? I mean..its an online diary right? except its not private cuz we're supposed to WANT people to read this? Well...im sure at this point if ur reading this, then you've already stopped...if not..READ ON! I did an ab workout this morning...got to burn the last 10 lbs b4 the abs can show though =(. OH and i can BARELY sit my ass down after doing those damn lunges 2 days ago! =( Im so sore. What else...its nice outside..maybe I should frolick through the grass wearing a frock. OK im ending this blog...so let me end it like this...not for the fobs (o)(o) lol  My Old School Rap for the day:  Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis  When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this  50 inch screen, money green leather sofa  Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur  Phone bill about two G's flat  No need to worry, my accountant handles that

       i can't believe i am ACTUALLY writing again. I honestly didn't think I was going to. So..i spent WAY too much time online today. More than I should...I think from Monday I'm going to stay away from the computer..BUT I CANT !!! Its my only connection to the real world and adults! Ok...well adults that act like they are still 5.&nbsp; Ok so..Monday..less time on the comp! I did an intense cardio workout today. And damn my whole body hurts!! I need a break tommorow. Well..time to go! Crabby Patty Is awake....     few hours later.....     &nbsp;   Someone shoot me please...i can't take anymore screaming baby for no reason at all! I've had it this evening now...I jsut want her to go to sleep a few hours early...WHY ME??? WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG???? Dang. I can't do anything to make her happy...all she wants to do is sit right on my face. She cant be tired, she jsut ate, she had her water, her diaper is fresh...what else is it??&nbsp; Anyways, she's better now. We're going out for dinner WooOohhoooOO! I've been craving mexican. All cheesey..mmmmmm cheese I LOWE CHEESE.&nbsp; SO...as I wait for my man to finish his weightlifting...i'll end this day with a rap from a little back in the day...    &nbsp;    I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
