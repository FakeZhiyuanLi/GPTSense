      I joined the concert/military band in the chinese high school, taking up the Alto Saxophone for 2 years before slacking off due to some private reasons and then i decided to rejoin the band in acjc. so far the experiences were rewarding and wonderful, my skills have improved tremendously... come on la...my standard is like a newbie when i joined. wonderful band with wonderful bandmates, teachers and conductor, respectfully known as Dr Lee Tian Tee. But this band a bit slack... If the band push more, i believe we, together, can make beautiful music that will create lasting impressions in people's mind, and probably their ear drums.  no need for any intro, people who come here should know who de hell i am... argh... holidays has ended... parents are back, can't play games till late at night anymore... anyway... they went to china, finland and russia... bought me this mp3 cd somewhere that has 180 mp3s... all the mp3s are saxophone pieces... Neat. Got pieces like Lion King, I just called... so many pieces... don't wanna waste my time typing names out.  anyway... at least one concert is over and done with... although many people say itz great, i dun really think so. STAR WARS was sarkie, Slavonic March (dun wanna say much la har...), Chorale and Shaker Dance and Ukrainian Rhapsody i not so sure yet. Lion King and Robin hood was alright i suppose... Pirates of the Caribbean i suppose everyone's fav was alright i think... overall... not so good... my conductor dun seem to be satisfied although he said "Great Job" to everyone. argh...guess we just have to work harder for the next concert.  just went barker's concert. the pieces are nice but the way they played... hmmm... still requires more practise and their concert etiquette still have a great space for improvement. Tapping of foot etc.  ALright, now in the middle of term exams... waiting for it to be over so that band can resume and we can proceed with our switzerland trip preparations...  7 more days to Switzerland trip
