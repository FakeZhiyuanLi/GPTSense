      A funny thing happened to me last night.&nbsp; One of the things I liked about heroin when I first did it was how cheap it was.&nbsp; 5 dollars would get me as high as a kite.&nbsp; However, very quickly it became the most expensive habit I could ever imagine.&nbsp; I worked at a Dry Cleaners for 7 dollars an hour which was definately not enough money to support my habit.&nbsp; I would steal enough money each day from the register so that my boss wouldn't notice.&nbsp; This was not enough either.&nbsp; I did countless other stupid things to get money of which I am not proud of.&nbsp; One of the things I did religously, though, was to steal money from my moms purse.&nbsp; I thought, hey, shes the one who left it unattended, thats what she gets.&nbsp; What a justification.&nbsp; My rule was that I would take one of every bill that there were more than 2 of.&nbsp; Then it just escalated to that I would take however much I needed.&nbsp; Anyway, last night while my mom was asleep I went into the kitchen to get some water.&nbsp; Her purse was sitting on the counter, open.&nbsp; I think I noticed it out of habit and the first thing that went through my mind was to take some money.&nbsp; I could see the money.&nbsp; But then, I realized what I was thinking and I just laughed.&nbsp; I didn't have to steal any more money, so I got my water and I went to bed.&nbsp; I guess its a completely inane story, but it made me feel good.

      I am grateful to be alive tonight.&nbsp; Its absolutely beautiful outside.&nbsp; Its raining, but warm with a nice breeze.&nbsp; I was sitting outside reading and smoking a cigarette and the smell of the rain just made me feel so alive.&nbsp; For once I think I actually enjoyed being alive without the thoughts of drugs running through my head.&nbsp; Im winning.&nbsp; Im beating this game.&nbsp; All I ever talk about is my recovery, but right now I dont feel like talking about that.&nbsp; Im doing just fine and Im proud of myself.&nbsp; My mom is real stressed out lately, but I cant blame her.&nbsp; Shes a perfect, innocent, beauty queen with a heroin addict daughter.&nbsp; Ironic if you ask me.&nbsp; But I love how good we're getting along these days.&nbsp; Im happy to be alive.&nbsp; I miss my dad, hes in Wisconsin.&nbsp; I wish that I wouldve spent more time with him over the past years.&nbsp; I miss my brother too, but he is so impossible to get along with.&nbsp; He really doesnt believe in me and thinks poorly of my mom.&nbsp; I think that those things reflect more on him and how he is than on us personally.&nbsp; I love my family,&nbsp; I have a 3 year old neice Mariah.&nbsp; She is just gorgeous and she tries to act just like me.&nbsp; I am happy that I will be able to be a positive role model in her life, and that her mom is starting to trust me to be alone with her.&nbsp; Back in my using days we would have to be supervised because no one trusts me.&nbsp; Thats all changing now because I changed.&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; I love being alive and I love my family.&nbsp; I may not have everything I want, but I never will.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very grateful for what I have and if I am selfish I will never feel satisfied.&nbsp; But right now, I do feel satisfied.&nbsp; I am happy with the person I am and the person I am becoming.&nbsp; Im excited to start school soon, and my 17th birthday is on Wednesday.&nbsp; Im very excited for that.&nbsp; Im also excited to go to Wisconsin for a few days in August to see my father.&nbsp; Im happy to be alive

      I relapsed.&nbsp; I really dont want to talk about the actual relapse, but I can tell you it sucked.&nbsp; I feel very guilty for having disappointed everyone, especially my mom.&nbsp; I feel ashamed for having let myself down, and I feel embarrassed for having to stand up in my meeting and get a 24 hour key tag 3 days after I received my 30 day key tag.&nbsp; Thursday night was when I told my IOP.&nbsp; No one else knew, and they were the first that I told.&nbsp; Of course the next step was to tell my mom, so that was what I planned to do when I got home.&nbsp; Its a long drive from Mesa to where I live, so I had a lot of time to think on the way home.&nbsp; I was so scared that I literally caught myself saying, "God, please let a car cross the yellow line and kill me, Please".&nbsp; I thought about it for a little while and then I said to myself, Come on, are you that pathetic?&nbsp; Your literally that selfish that you think dying will solve the problem?&nbsp; Because although I may not have to deal with it, my mom will still find out that her daughter relapsed, but now she'll have to deal with her only daughter's death as well.&nbsp; So obviously that wasn't a good decision.&nbsp; I kept driving and all of the sudden the thought came to me that I should run away.&nbsp; I could live with friends for a few days and get some money, and then I could go to Mexico.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought to myself, yeah because then my mom would STILL know that I relapsed, but she wouldn't know whether I was dead or alive.&nbsp; Plus, I know that if I ran I would go fully back into and shooting heroin and living on the streets in Mexico, I dont really think Im going to live too long.&nbsp; By this time I was almost home and the final thought popped into my head that if I had to go home and tell her, I could atleast get high first.&nbsp; I said outloud "2 minutes until Im home, and my mom will be there and then I will be safe.&nbsp; Just drive home." and that is what I did.&nbsp; However, apon arriving home I found that my mom was not there.&nbsp; So I had the house to myself and I was entertaining the thought of going out and getting high one last time.&nbsp; I realized however, that my problem was that I relapsed, and do I actually think that relapsing again is going to improve my situation in any way?&nbsp; And why am I hiding from these feelings?&nbsp; Dont I know that running from feelings is what got me here in the first place?&nbsp; I had a decision to make, I could either do whats right and sit there and wait for my mom to get home, and tell her, and begin dealing with things, or I could take the easy way out, and kill myself, run away, or get high.&nbsp; Im actually very proud of myself because I chose to do the right thing and I sat there, as hard as it was, I sat there and I waited for my mom to get home.&nbsp; The whole time I just kept telling myself that no matter how hard it seemed and no matter how easy the alternative would've been, if I just did the right thing and kept doing the right thing, eventually the right thing will be the easy thing.&nbsp; And that really got me through it.&nbsp; My mom was disappointed and angry, but after those subsided, she was supportive and is really happy that I faced up to it and didn't fall right back in, and I am too.&nbsp; Im glad that I can go to my meeting and they will accept me back there and not judge me or be ashamed in me.&nbsp; Im lucky to have the support that I have, and with that I'll pass.

       Everything crashed down at once,    Her life seemed unlivable.   The mistakes she had made,   Appeared unforgivable.    &nbsp;  She knew that it must end,   She couldn't go on living this way.   She surrendered to the unknown,   And gave all that she had, to live each day.    &nbsp;  It wasn't pleasant and it wasn't easy   But she beat her addiction.   She began to love life as a   A statistical contradiction.    &nbsp;  She never took anything for granted,   and never asked why.   She had learned that "why" was not a question,   but a lesson learned in time.    &nbsp;  She lived everyday to the fullest,   No more needles and spoons, no more pain.   All of the things&nbsp;and friends she lost   Made no comparison to what&nbsp;she gained.    On&nbsp;a&nbsp;warm July night,   She was driving&nbsp;home from town,   When a car&nbsp;crossed that yellow line.   Next thing she knew&nbsp;she was laying on the cold, hard ground.    The paramedics were all around her, She couldn't speak, but she knew she was going to die. When she heard the police man speak, All she could think was "why?"  He told another cop about the man driving, That he had fallen asleep at the wheel. He admitted to being on heroin. She couldn't believe this was real  As she breathed her last breath she thought her last thought. My whole life heroin wanted to beat me, it wanted to win. I wouldn't let it though I wouldn't give in.  Well I guess its all too powerful. The Devil will have his way, and as she accepted that Heroin had finally killed her, She slowly drifted away.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

        Trust.  Assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, and truth of someone.&nbsp; I do not trust others for one very simple reason, I do not trust myself.&nbsp; I am like two people in a way when I think about it, because how can it be possible for someone not to trust themself?&nbsp; I know that I lie to others, but to accept the fact that I lie to myself is not possible in my eyes.&nbsp; I know that I do it though, and I know that I must change that.&nbsp; I want to analyze the definition above in relation to myself.&nbsp; Assured reliance.&nbsp; The ability to be confidently dependent apon.&nbsp; Can I confidently rely on my character?&nbsp; Character.&nbsp; The complex mental and ethical traits of an individual.&nbsp; Ethical traits; moral qualities.&nbsp; Let me speak about my mental and moral qualities.&nbsp; Mental.&nbsp; Relating to the emotional and intellectual response of an individual to external reality.&nbsp; Hmm, considering for the past 6 years I have not only avoided, but literally escaped external reality that I must not be to good, mentally.&nbsp; I lied and manipulated myself and others, I slowly killed myself, fully consious of what I was doing. I am filled with feelings that I fear and have no idea how to deal with.&nbsp; My moral qualities have gone to shit.&nbsp; Dont lie, dont steal, dont intentionally hurt people, dont manipulate, help others, do not be selfish, work for the common good, treat everyone with respect, especially your parents.&nbsp; I have not followed a damn one of those.&nbsp; I can confidently say that no, I cannot rely on my character.&nbsp; Can I confidently rely on my ability?&nbsp; Concidering I could not follow my&nbsp; morals, I did horrible things to undeserving people, and I failed at nearly everything I did, or attempted to do.&nbsp; I could not control myself and I let my life become unmanageable.&nbsp; I know that if heroin were in front of me right now I would do it, in a heartbeat.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot confidently rely on my ability. Can I confidently rely on my strength? Strength; The power to resist.&nbsp; No I cannot.&nbsp; I give in.&nbsp; I give in to myself, I give in to others, I give in to my needs, my wants, and my desires.&nbsp; I give in to drugs, and I give in to happiness.&nbsp; I cannot rely on my strength.&nbsp; Can I confidently rely on my truth, in other words my honesty?&nbsp; Absolutely not.&nbsp; As hard as this is for me, I have just outlined and analyzed the fact that in no remote way whatsoever, I cannot trust myself. How shitty is that?

      I hate myself.&nbsp; I think that I just realized this today.&nbsp; I have said it many times before, but only meant it in the sense that I hate my lifestyle.&nbsp; Well, I quit heroin, I came clean, I was forced to be brutally honest.&nbsp;&nbsp; I failed that.&nbsp; I realized today that I am still living like I used to, I may not be using, but Im still Lying, manipulating, scheming, and fucking things up.&nbsp; Although no one knows, I am hurting others, and I am hurting myself.&nbsp; I have decided to come clean to myself and to God, and that tomorrow, I will start new.&nbsp; I will strive everyday to be as fucking honest as possible and I will not look back at the past.&nbsp; I feel no need to tell everyone everything that I have lied about because I cannot change those things.&nbsp; The only thing I can change and control is myself in the present and in the future.&nbsp; God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am very confused. I hate that I have no control, over drugs and over other people.&nbsp; My old best friend, until recently anyway, is still using, she is lying to me when I can flat out see the track marks in her arms and I know that she is still buying dope daily.&nbsp; I hate it.&nbsp; I hate that she is killing herself and I hate that someday soon I will hear that she has died.&nbsp; I cant take it.&nbsp; I have one other friend who has tried desperately to quit junk and has now found himself addicted to it once again, I want nothing more than to be able to help him, but I know that I cannot.&nbsp; I can only offer my support.&nbsp; I also have 2 family members, my brother, an alcoholic and my uncle, a tweeker to say the least, who I know are at the end of their ropes.&nbsp; I wish I could make them see what they are doing to themselves, but I cannot.&nbsp; All I can do is hope.&nbsp; The last person that I wish I could control is my father.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a hardcore alcoholic his whole life.&nbsp; He has now been sober for 8 years.&nbsp; I watched him go from a horrible unhuman being, to the most loving and caring person I have ever known.&nbsp; He has now gone to Wisconsin and he shared with me his concern that he is very aware of how easy it would be to sit in his house up there all alone and have a drink, and no one would ever know.&nbsp; This kills me.&nbsp; He is my inspiration and if he began drinking again my life would fall apart.&nbsp; Thats all for now

      The question why is never one that I have ever dealt with because I thought it pointless.  Things are what they are and why is neither here nor there, it is simply a question to which the answer is irrelevant and cannot change the present.  I have a whole new outlook on the question why.  It can be asked and answered to anything.  What Ive been thinking about tonight is Why did I do what I did, and what do I think about  the "disease of addiction".  The disease part is part of my first step which I started tonight.  To me, the disease is confusing, but tied into why I did what I did.  I was born with the predisposition to addiction but that doesn't mean shit.  Everytime I used, or did something stupid, I knew full well what I was doing and how bad it was.  But yet I still did it.  I wanted to use, and then I "needed" to use, and then I used, and when I used too much is when it turned to addiction, but even after I was addicted I made the conscious choice to use each and every time I did.  However, I do believe that I now suffer from this "disease" and it will never go away, although I am not going to blame any of my actions on my genes or my "disease" because I did what I did because I wanted to do it, not because my dad was an alcoholic and it was my fate to be a heroin addict.  I also think that I have figured out why I wanted to so bad.  I wanted to get fucked up because I didnt like being sober.  I didnt like being sober because I was scared of the emotions I was having and I didn't want to deal with them.  The emotions were guilt, shame, regret, and anger that I knew I shouldn't have.  Even though what I continued to do intenisfied these feelings and in the end made them worse, it temporarily numbed them and that was what I needed.  But why was I so angry and who was I really angry at?  It would appear that I was always angry at my mom. Although she is a wonderful person, she just plain pissed me off.  It is because she tried to control me.  Why did I hate being controlled?  Because I knew that I was out of control and being controlled just intensified that knowledge, which made me more guilty and shameful, and let to more uncontrollableness, followed by more attempted control and more anger.  I dont know what any of this means, but I am really proud of myself that I am actually dealing with feelings and that haunting word, WHY.  I must be getting better.

      I have been writing in this for a few days now, and I think its time to share my story.  Its not the worst drug horror story, actually to most it might not even compare, but it is mine.  I have a hard time remembering a lot, but I will write what I know.  It started when I was 10 years old and my older brother, who was 14 at the time convinced me that it was okay to smoke pot.  I tried it, and I didn't really get high. The next few times I smoked with him throughout that year, he thought I was a real hard ass because I could smoke so much, and I did too, but in reality it wasn't doing anything to me.  I dont remember the first time I actually got stoned, but I know it was sometime when I was 10 and I was with my brother, and I loved it.  I continued to occasionally smoke with him until I was 12.  Thats when I discovered alcohol.  My father had been a hardcore alcoholic and I never understood that, until the first time I drank, the first time I got drunk.  I had stolen my mom's bottle of Kahlua and I spent the night getting trashed in my room and making random phone calls.  I continued to do this weekly until I met my best friend (to this day).  From then on we would spend Friday and Saturday nights taking Tequila shots and getting stoned.  Life was great.  When I was 13 and in 8th grade this girl and I decided it would be "cool" to call in a bomb threat to our school. We went through this whole ordeal and ofcourse got caught and charged with three misdemeanors, trespassing, threatening, and vandlization, as well as two felonies, threatening an educational facility and extortion. At 14 I started my freshman year of highschool with a sentence of one-year probation and 60 hours of community service, I got lucky.  Anyway, Lucky for me, there were no drugs involved with the charges so my PO found no reason to ever drug test me.  I had stopped talking to my friend for the time being, but I had new friends, two guys, both a few years older than me, Matt and Jon.  We got stoned everyday before and after school, and on the weekends we spent the nights in Jon's room drinking warm beer and smoking out of a hookah.  I eventually started dating Matt when I was 15 and he had stopped smoking pot, so I did too.  But he was an alcoholic, and I began to drink 3 to 4 times a week.  I also sadly got addicted (in a way) to vivarin, an over the counter caffiene pill.  I would stay awake for a few days and then sleep mostly the whole weekend. I "needed it" though, with the stress of school and work(at Blimpies) and all.  Anyway, I quit the pills but kept on drinking until me and Matt broke up, the summer I turned 16 and all hell broke loose.  I got an awesome truck, I had tons of friends, life was great.  I would smoke pot before school, after school,and all day until I went to bed. Then things got even better because my friend hooked me up with a job at a cleaners where I could smoke pot out back and steal money from the register without anyone knowing.  Things continued like that until March of this year.  My mom took my family to Cancun for spring break, and I bought as many pain killers and muscle relaxers as I could smuggle onto the plane.  When we got back I started regularly taking them and on the second day of being home I was so out of my head that I thought it would be fun to run away to California.  I took my friend Kris and we left, I told my mom I was going to work.  After running from the cops and scavenging for food and a place to sleep for a week, I decided to go home. I also decided that I would quit doing drugs and rebuild my relationship with my mom, that decision lasted 2 days before I was getting stoned again, but I wanted something more.  I bought Ketamine. I had no idea what it was, but it was pink and it looked exciting.  So, i bought it and I loved it. It made me feel drunk and it made me not care about anything.  I stayed on that for a week or so until I was out of money.  I was intensely grounded for running away, and so desperate to get high that I spent the day while my mom was at working huffing nail polish remover, gas, and anything else I could find.  Finally I got off grounding and I met a new friend, Taylor, a cokehead.  I started doing coke and binging on it for a few months.  I lost a lot of wait and just looked like hell.  Finally after a bad dose I decided to quit and go back to smoking pot. Thats when I met Rylea. We were best friends from the moment we met, she convinced me that I hated Taylor, and I ended up pulling Taylor out of her house and beating the shit out of her right in front of her family. Anyway, Rylea and I smoked pot together for a few weeks, until she introduced me to heroin. It was instantly my best friend and I was instantly addicted.  Although I was only on it for about a month, I have very little recollection of that month, except for the excessive sleeping and craving. I do know that during that month things got unbearable, unmanageable, and I was a walking dead girl.  Although it may not seem like a lot, its sad that it took me all that to realize I had a problem, thats when I checked into the detox center and I have been clean ever since.  And thats my story

      I don't really know what to write about tonight, but I know that I need to write.  I need to write and I need to vent or I will get high.  There is no question in my mind that without getting my feelings out and being completely honest with myself and everyone around me, I will get high.  I dont want to get high.  If I get high, I hope that I will overdose and die because there is no point to another wasted life and more wasted oxygen.  If I am using that is what I am doing, wasting oxygen, killing myself, hurting people, leaving a path of destruction and ruin in every aspect of my life.  Going nowhere, taking one step forward and two steps back.  Ruining.  I am sick of ruining, and I am sick of running.  I am sick of being a hardened person with desires and obsessions. I am sick of being a slave and a bad person and doing bad things because I am not able to take control of my own life.  Why the fuck did I sell my soul?  That is exactly what I did.  I sold my soul to drugs every day of my life.  I was a slave to them.  I did what they wanted me to do and they controlled my body, my mind, and everything about me.  They destroyed my relationships, my self worth, my appearance, and my life.  They turned me into this thing that was not even human, this being that walked the earth and lived to stick a needle in my arm.  To feel the rush, the warmth, the high.  I needed it, I wanted it, I got it, I thrived off of it. I got high to live and I lived to get a high.  It is one big sick twisted cycle of shame and getting high and needing it and getting it.  There was no being without.  It was my top priority above honesty, my family, my hygeine, sleep, above my fucking sanity.  There was nothing more important to me than getting high, and I was damned good at getting what I wanted.  I am the best fucking manipulator and bullshitter that I have ever met.  That is what we as addicts are best at, because it is all we know.  To me, the truth was never an option.  It never even crossed my mind that it might be easier or better or RIGHT to tell the truth.  "The truth will set you free" yeah right mother fuckers the truth will send me to rehab or jail or God knows where else it might send me, but it definately will not set me free.  Well, look what happened, I told the truth and I am in rehab and Im not free.  But Im getting there.  Im fucking getting there and that is better and more significant than any other thing that I have ever done in my sad, little cycle of a drug addicted, dope feining life.  What was it that I needed?  What was it that I felt I could not obtain from sobriety?  Could I really have been so dense as to think that my life was okay, and that all the bad shit was everyone else's fault?  Did I honestly not see how badly everything was and that it was all my fault?  Whatever it was that made me realize it, whether it was not being able to look myself in the eye, or detoxing in a hospital, whatever the hell it was I am thankful.  I am truly thankful that I pulled my head out of my ass long enough to see the world from a new perspective.  A perspective that showed me that I was powerless and I was unmanageable and I never wanted to go back to that again.  A perspective that got me to where I am right now, proud, and sober.

      After getting a shitty night's sleep, I somehow feel rejuvinated.  I read a lot last night in a book called "a million little pieces".  Its about a guy going through the detox off cocaine.  Its an intense book and it made me feel lucky to have detox behind me.  I guess I need to share my story.  Just for now I'll share the end of it.  My last use date was the night of Monday, June 21st.  I remember the night well, but at the same time I have no recollection of what I did.  Anyway, I woke up Tuesday afternoon (after getting my usual 18 hours of sleep) and I was sick.  This wasn't the first time I had a dope hangover, but one of the few.  I went into the bathroom and threw up.  Then I looked in the mirror, and for the first time, realized that I have a problem.  It may sound self centered, but I know that I am a very pretty girl.  When I looked into that mirror I was atrocious.  My hair was greasy considering showering was never on my list of priorities.  Although I slept 16 to 18 hours a night I had dark bags under my eyes.  I had significantly lost weight and my clothes appeared to hang off of my fragile body.  My body was covered in bruises and odd cuts that I had accumulated without knowing exactly how, "probably just from passing out" I thought with such arrogance.  My arms looked like I had been beaten with a stick full of nails.  There were track marks like all hell, surrounded by black bruises and swelling.  but worst of all, I couldn't even look myself in the eye, because when I finally did, it hit me with a shock of pain down my spine.  I was not Kathryn.  This was not me, and not anything I had ever wanted to be.  I was a junkie, a penniless junkie that needed help.  There was no connection to my soul when I stared into my eyes, just a pale blank stare looking back at me. It had been a miracle that my mom had stayed with me through this, I guess relying on the miracle that she had no idea what was going on.  I went to her and told her everything, I just broke down.  I told her that I was scared, and I didn't know what I was supposed to do, but I knew that I needed help.  She immediately checked me into the detox center at the hospital, and after a few days of withdrawls including sickness and extreme pain, things got better.  I was there for 7 days and I am thankful that they kept me there that long.  If my mom hadn't been there to help me I don't know where I would be right now.  Probably close to death, thats definately the road I was headed down.  But today I am looking better.  Only 22 days clean and the track marks are healing, Im beginning to look and feel healthy, and I now shower daily.  I can't say that the sparkle is back in my eye, however, since I am still so ashamed with myself that I have avoided looking myself in the eyes ever  since that day. Anyway, I feel wonderfully rejuvinated today.  I know that I dont need to promise that I am going to stay sober for ever, just for today.  And I KNOW that I am not going to get high today, so thats all that matters.

      Okay this is a little weird.  Im not really big on this whole computer thing and I just came across this website where I can have a log for free and write whatever the hell I feel like?  I guess its kinda cool. Anyway Im having a horrible time.  Im in recovery for heroin and Im 21 days sober today.  I guess thats really good, and I am proud of myself its just that Im in a really weird place.  Ive been doing drugs for the past six years, and Im only sixteen.  Drugs is all I know and the drug lifestyle is the only one Ive ever lived.  I guess its just that, to me, I am at a place where I have to make a huge decision.  I know that I am a drug addict and I will never be able to socially drink or use, so I have two lifestyles to choose from.  1.  My old lifestyle, getting high all the time and not caring about anything, while my whole life spirals down the drain and I lose everything that I love.  Okay, while getting fucked up is really fun and if I didn't love doing it I wouldn't be where I am today, I just do not want to return to that lifestyle and die a lonely death with absolutely nothing.  Its insane how easily drugs will drain you of your money, friends, family, and more importantly, your emotions.  2. The sober lifestyle, which Im sure is great, but its unknown territory to me.  Plus, this may sound shallow, but it sounds boring as hell.  I hate routine and the thought of going to meetings everyday and struggling with addiction for the rest of my life, seems extremely routine and boring.  I dont know why, but it really bums me out that I will never really be a sober person, I will always be a drug addict, a sick drug addict, struggling each day to stay sober, for the rest of my fucking life, which, since Im only sixteen, is a long fucking time.  Anyway, Im just really in an odd place right now because Im faced with this decision between two places that neither one of them do I want to be in.  I know which one is the better choice, the smarter choice, and the healthier choice, but the fact that Ive never lived that way,and that I look at it with such an impression that it will be boring, just pulls me back to the using lifestyle which really sucks. Hopefully I will get some sort of insight as to where I need to be, and also where I want to be.

      I haven't written in such a long time it seemed I forgot that I even had this.  I need help.  I need help real fucking bad.  I feel like Im going to relapse, Ill talk about whats going on with me.  First of all, I liked this guy, Bobby.  I liked him a lot.  He went back out, he's still back out.  I had so much faith in my friend Alex, he was staying sober and doing so well.  He went back out, hes still back out.  My brother is not supportive.  My dad is still in love with my mom, and wants her back but there is no way she will ever go back with him after the things he did to her while he was an active alcoholic.  I have lost all of my old friends, I feel alone.  Except for one friend, Sal, who I feel is confused.  I want to help him, but I dont know how.  Im lonely, Im so codependent its sick, and Im very lonely.  My sponsor is going through some tough times and I try to be there for her, which I think takes away from her being there for me.  My exboyfriend, the love of my life, the only guy I have ever truly loved, is still using.  He just today told me that he thinks it is in my best interest if we never talk again.  He said it so nonchalant like it doesnt even fucking bother him.  Well it bothers me, it fucking hurts.  Not only that, but his little brother, one of my best friends, told me this afternoon that he thinks he is in love with me.  I started my Senior year of high school today.  Shitty.  I like my classes but everyone knows what happened to me and I dont like that.  I dont like my shit advertised and gossiped about all over campus. My college applications are due in 2 months.  Im scared, Im scared of not being prepared, Im scared of rejection, and Im scared of dissapointment.  Im scared of not feeling good enough.  This may not seem like a lot, but Im hurting very badly.  I have 31 days sober today.  Its a big deal, because this is the longest I have EVER been sober.  Im fucking scared, and my heart fucking hurts.  I need help
