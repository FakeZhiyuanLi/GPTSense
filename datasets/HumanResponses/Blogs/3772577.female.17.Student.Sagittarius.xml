      so i've been wanting to phone up megan for months now, and haven't been able to until a few days ago I decided that this is enough, I have to do it now. B works today so all afternoon I rehearsed what I would say and started sweating and shaking. I dialed her number; she was there. I started by saying something about how I was sorry about being distant and not talkative and getting my noise out of joint, when she interrupted me by saying she had to go eat supper. Oh, ok. She'd phone me back. I paced around waiting for the phone to ring. pace pace. Ring. We talked as if nothing had ever happened, like it was last summer all over again...well not really. We were both nervous and a little weirded out and nothing was really the same. We hadn't phoned since November. Us who had spent everyday together last summer. I tried explaining how much it hurt seeing her ride by everyday, on a new horse, on the seventh horse she's had while I had my one, with that look that cowgirls in calendars and magazines have, where everything looks just right, that I have envied all my horse owning years. I didn't tell her all that of course, I don't know if she even understands what I did tell her. I asked her if maybe she could take me for a ride sometime; it would be the most important thing she could do for me ever. I mean I haven't even touched a horse since He died. Except for that pony in November which I reluctantley scratched for 2 seconds which doesn't count. I  cannot  describe the pain that I feel about this whole horse, dead Horse, pain, grief, thing. The only person that I have tried to explain it to is M. I feel so vulnerable. Laying my heart open to her and leaving it up to someone else to decide if they will break it or not. Anyway she said taht she would have to ride Mirage some more, becuase she is pretty green and wild lately. So there is some hope. But I was thinking today...no don't be disapointed. I refuse to be. Just now that I've made this step I want to go all the way with it, not wait around. I am scared. I am hopeful. I am mournful. And the only thing in my mind is a beautiful bay gelding galloping free of any arthritis or shortness of breath, or back pain and I know that I made the best choice.                             tear       urlLink ">Link

      Today was the longest day I have had the displeasure to experience in a very long time. The hours, the minutes dragged by endlessly. Painfully. Usually I spend every minute with M, now he's gone off to Q-town to work, lucky him, and i have nothing to do but wander around, weed my garden, read, tan; all of which I love doing...in moderation and while I enjoy it. I sound spoiled I know. But when I am used to always doing stuff this empty void of endless blank days frustrates me. Lucky M, he has a job, I need one very badly. I have been looking since March, nothing. Yes I know I have been picky, but I don't want to stoop to the level of clog-your-arteries stink-like-grease-after-ten-showers would-you-like-fries-with-that quite yet. I plan to work this summer,  save  my money, work as far through the last school year as I can considering the amount of homework I will have, and graduate. I plan to have sent off my application to university in Ireland in the grade 12 school year,  get accepted , and leave for Ireland around August. In between Graduation and Leaving I say my goodbyes. That will be so hard. I want to go up with M to see Karin and Dale and the trapline before I leave. And the other goodbyes...M's goodbye will be the hardest. I haven't figured that one out yet. B droppped me off at the library today. She left and only then did I realize that the library opened in half an hour. I counted red and white cars until sharp ten when I figured they would open. I come in and the place is packed with people well established and settled in. When did they then open? I was grumpy from then on. The day contined like this. Very long. Finally we got home. A friend returning from Italy came and reminded me of how much I want to see Europe. I am tired of this North American blindness. I want free and sophisticated Europe very badly. Only one and a half months till Ireland. :) M phoned last night. I got all choked up. Hearing his voice was good, very good. His aunt already introduced him to some young pretty ladies his age...ggrrrr. "Uh Aunty, I have a girlfriend..." I don't think she heard. One was cute he said. Not to worry. He wouldn't do anything. His devotion stops him. I wish he were here...no I don't want to hinder him from experiencing this great opportunity of his. It's good for him to be away, to work, to see new people. I can survive. He comes home on Thursday though. I am looking forward to seeing him. I wonder what penalty his parents can concoct this time. We left his house on Sunday, went to mine, and said our 'goodbyes' in our own way. He stayed too long(read: 20 minutes); they heard when his truck left, his mom sped to stop him, yelled some power hungry fascist threats and drove away. I thought she would drive in here too, to condemn my soul, so I locked the door. She didn't though. He needs to get away from his parents most of all. I would change this for him if I could. Sometimes I wonder if that is the meaning of love; to want to do everything in your power to end the discomfort and misery and pain of someone else. Or is the meaning of love feeling the other person's pain in every part of your body when they hurt? Or the feeling that every cell in your body is the same and mirrored in their body and there is no such thing as two people but one glowing shimmering whole. I don't know...maybe the meaning of love is that it has many meanings, a meaning for everyone who has ever experienced it. Anyway there's my sappy end to this self-centered post. I hope tomorrow is better.       urlLink ">Link

      I recently finished a book by one of my favorite authors, Donna Jo Napoli, called Song of the Magdalene. It, like many other Naopli books, takes a relativley well known story or chracter, and looks at it from a completely different perspective. Other books like this are Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley. In this case the story told of the events in her life that lead Mary Magdalene, or Miriam of Magdala, to seek Christ. I wonder sometimes how much of all this is true. Is the usual story true, the one which includes the seven demons, six fingers, people turning to stone, magic swords, and the like, or is the opposite side true. That these were real and human people, with their own fears and trials and sorrows. And the tales that have sprung up around them were simply bred from other ignorant people's distrust, supersticion, and fears. I don't know.I do wonder though...It makes more sense to see all these fantastical stories as how they really could have happened. To look at the grain of truth behind the myths is intriguing, I find. It makes me wonder about world mythology too; stories like the tale of Isis and Osiris. Were they real, what were they like, what made people turn their lives and love into a fantastical myth? Anyway, B and I are planning a day on the road on Saturday. We don't know quite where we want to go yet. Either Mt. Robson like last year, or Kelowna; someplace different and warm. She asked me yesterday whether I wanted to go to the W.L. Stampede. Oh the IRONY. Every year since I can remember I have wanted to go there. So.Incredibly.Badly. This is the first year that I definately dont' want to go. I cannot be around all the horse-iness of the event, of the culture, cannot be around cowboys, of three year olds learning to ride before they can walk, cannot stand all the people that I was...that I want to be. I am not them anymore, not since he died. I want to be a part of that vast horse community again more than  anything . I can't and it hurts so bad. I don't tell B this however. Like I said, I am afraid of showing weakness. See the paradox. Yeah I know...get over it.

      Well, this is my first time doing this; bear with me. I don't want to feel that I should be living up to any expectations in this blogging process, but yet I feel nervous. I do however need to do this. My summer will be lonely; I feel it. With Futt Buzz, Stino, Chocolate Momma, and Mr.Oscar gone I will wander around here with aching thoughts swirling around my head in circles. I hope that this will serve as a release. Up until now my release has been poetry. Due to emotional/physical experiences this has somewhat dried up but now and then a trickle does come forth. Here are most of my poems if anybody is interested. www.allpoetry.com/poets/Wind%20Child But I think that I will wrap it up here; I am tired and it's 12:30, I am wishing I were not here but 2 hours to the south, curled up in M's (aka Mr. Oscar) arms, knowing it can't happen, generally feeling sorry for myself, and very overfond of semicolons; they just look so useful. Toodles

       Here's the link to the  urlLink webcam &nbsp;to the town where we lived in Austria. My grands still live there. A sleepy little village 25 k outside of Vienna on the Danube. It's strange having lived in many different places you leave a part of yourself everywhere but you also have a home everywhere. Some days I miss Europe so much, and I know that when I leave here I will miss it too.

       Angry. Why am I angry? frustrated. Why. mad, confused burdened miserable, hypocritical upset moody. Lonely.&nbsp; He knows nothing about what he's talking about. He asks questions that he doesn't know the answer to, doesn't know what he's asking or expecting the answer to be.    'Be your own person,    there's more to life than me and horses.' Frick. I think i know that. it's you who doesn't seem to grasp that there's more to your life than me. Turn it around and he doesn't know how to deal. He's a one way street man. What does he know about what life is to me without him or horses. He doesn't know the real me and never has.    'Find yourself Where&nbsp;is teh real you?'   I&nbsp;misplaced her.   'Where? Find her'   She's gone in a yellow and white shoebox under the bed that contains&nbsp;the remains of&nbsp;a happier life. You're not touching her you've never known her...   She's dead   'Why?' She died with The Horse   'So what without your dead horse your not happy?' 'Don't expect so much to happen...just relax, don't want so much'    &nbsp;   There's more to life than horses you know it's true just listen to me i am giving up i try to help there's more to life find things that make you happy this is a breakthrough, why are you miserable, i love you babe, without some dead horse you're not happy?....There's more to life than horses you should realize that...       &nbsp;  I don't know what more to write I am&nbsp; numb I am confused at my own anger and emotions in a way not though i feel better having cried but worse for this outburst because even&nbsp;for all these words I can't find&nbsp;a reason for it. The Horse meant so much more to me than he will ever know and that makes me upset because I love One Way Street Man, and I want to share everything with him, every experience every pain every joy, just as I want him to share his with me. I can't though I have a block I feel that since he doesn't know at all what i am going through&nbsp;my confidences with him are wasted. He doesn't know where to begin to help me. I dont' talk to him about all the times that I cry and all the days of pain but it hurts so much more not to tell him. In a close relationship like ours, that we shouldn't even be in at our stage of maturity, you feel so incredibly close to your partner that you cannot hide anuthing. aaaahhh running in circles here.&nbsp;    I know that I have lost who I am. and I have given up hope on that. it's ironic taht&nbsp;he should bring up that I should be myself when it's he who was the reason for my loss of self.I'll remember that though. It's gonna come up again, this find yourself bulltweet. When I go my way; 'well sweety i am being my own person, i've found who I am'   yeah right i am too attached. But that's a whole other heartache.    'Think about what I said'&nbsp; (Which was all spit in the wind)   I don't want to.   'Chickenshit'   ...ouch. i love you too.   That too will   come to bite you in the ass my friend. That too.    I jsut don't want to fight with him. I want to be ok with him, but why taht is not so is also a whole other story. I thought taht this rant would make me feel better. Before I wrote this I cried and yelled and mowed the lawn with such force it was done in less than half the time it usually takes. I was purely emotional then. Now I am upset deep in me I feel the hard coil of upsetness in my stummy and it's not a good feeling. I don't want to go to sleep like this and don't want to feel that familiar dark scary/yet confortable cave feeling of depresssion settling in. But it is.    I want to enjoy life i do, he does't realize that at all, but I can't. There is nothing for me without horses. Instead of saying find other things that make you happy besides horses, why didn't he ask me why I can't be happy with horses again because really that's what my healing quest is all about. To be able to be happy around horses again and not feel physical pain. Horses = Life&nbsp; I am hollow otherwise. I wish he could be here to read this adn then to hug me...after I use him as a punching bag. Is love like this? Somehow I don't quite think so.    &nbsp;  "A sea of salt tears that the angels have cried..."   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Jerusalem by Yael Wand    &nbsp;  that's all for tonight folks

      So I was writing for about ten minutes when my computer froze and I was scrolled down a ways so I couldn't see what I had written. Argh.  Today was another very hot day. I painted the porch and hate tan lines so I did it nude. It felt great and liberating. That's a good thing about living in the country you can pretty much do what you want. Often in the summer I run around either scantily clad or not clad at all, and it feels great. I hate having to wear clothes in the heat, and can't understand it other people do so. M came home today and he can't seem to get away from my anger. When he left for Quesnel last weekend I was mad, and when he came home today I was mad.&nbsp; He just seems so, 'inconsiderate' seems too harsh but he can't seem to put himself on other people's positions. Here's the poem I said I would post, doesn't have a title yet and needs some tweaking::  intersting how so little can start so&nbsp;much an invitation dangles on your lips as an anxious tooth bites the lower one your expectantly waiting eyes burn  with desire the kitchy cliche must be used I'm afraid They take on an intense flame of all the things you'd say to me speaking with your hands and lips or your voice, the difference doesn't seem to matter our bodies move, edging closer, the wrong and right sides of two magnets push and pull us your lips still wait slightly parted, as if you've just said the most important words of your life If I jump who knows how deep I'll go? I can simply break this spell by looking away then the magical droning of rushing blood in my ears would recede but before the question is asked the desicion has&nbsp;already been&nbsp;made the negative space between us  shimmers, sifts, contracts, closes, is gone. the questions that hung there  dissapear, smothered, answered. hands fly to my hair dig deep deeper fingers become claws through their need nails dig deep wanting always more wanting the full pallete all the colours, the fireworks, and explosions what is this need? Is it for completion? For acknowldegment? For acceptance? For the unspoken approval, Your all grown up now it's an illusion fingers still fumble in the darkness and selfconsious thoughts and giggles ripple the steamy surface of a constructed widescreen love scene it is sweet nonetheless and even when your hands aren't  insistent claws clutching anymore and when our bodies make a sundial marking the passage and lack of time in its many metaphor forms I already see next time and imagine the question that's not quite a plea for mercy in your eyes I wonder if that decision is already made too.  &nbsp; Today we ate the first potatoes from our garden. I love having a garden. Everyone should have one.&nbsp;

       Hot day today. The heat makes me emotionally nauseous. There's something weird going on. A first in my life. I miss the company of people, of peers. I want to be in a crowd. This is alien to me. Before I was just a happy kid, following my dad around or sitting with my mom as she sewed. Or I would play by myself. Then there was always  urlLink The Horse  that I could be with. The only  urlLink friend  and company that I needed. And then there was M&nbsp;this past year. Now as I have neither of these two loves I find that I crave the company of groups of peers. I want to be doing something. I want to go to parties, I want to, in the fall, look back and remember good times with the gang. It's strange becuase I have never missed that. But today I saw all these people going everywhere, hanging out at the park, riding their bikes to...anywhere, cruising around in the car; I miss that.   Anyway, enough of that. What else is there to say. We got our tickets for the trip to Ireland in August. Exciting. Hopefulling everything thing will&nbsp;be wonderful.   I wrote another poem the other day. I just need a title for it. Don't know about taht yet. I'll post it up here tomorrow, well today in a minute.   Sorry about the links, they're just personal pain reminders, meant for nothing other than, "look what you don't have anymore" stupidity.    I am very tired.

       It's all about what people want isn't it. I mean it's not about what is right, or how it's supposed to turn out, ever. It all depends on how much someone wants something, no matter if you do or don't.   Today some guy asked me how I was and I was reminded of how dishonest we are when I, without even thinking about it, automatically answered, oh good. I had a miserable day. Why do we do that. And also, all those times when you cry, alone, for whatever reason, whether you're crying yourself to sleep, crying while driving, while just being alone, will anyone ever know about all those times? Do they matter to anyone but you? Will it, at the end of the day, just be another one of those things that you know you got through, and you know that it only can matter to you, becuase it's about you and no one else even needs to know?    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Today marks the 9 month anniversary of&nbsp; His  death. Funny but the months don't mean anything to me. They just mark the passage of time, not pain or memory. I cried again today about him. I thought I was beginning to get over it, but today was a step in the other direction.

      The feeling of wanting to be somewhere else is very strong. I just came back from Quesnel to visit M for the weekend, and now being home, not doing anything, by myself, I feel useless. If I were with him we would both be happy. I feel like I need to be there when he comes home from work, need to be the arms he comes to when he needs comfort, need to be beside him to drive away the sleepless nights. Here all I can do is think of these things, pray that he is safe, that he'll come home to me safe, that I will see him again on the weekend. I wish I could spend my summer down there with him, but I have to work, I need to be here and earn some money for after school. Maybe this will teach us how to be apart though; how lucky we were when we saw each other everyday, how lucky we are to live beside each other. Thinking about my future with M scares me. Yesterday I suddenly stupidly imagined what it would  be like if he died. And I can't imagine it. It doesn't work in my mind. The possibility doesn't exist. Even the thought of us breaking up and after some time being with other people doesn't work in my mind, although this is the more logical and likely outcome of the two scenarios. After all you go through with someone, after how indescribably close you become to someone in all sorts of ways, how can you be with someone else after that and forsake the first person? I don't understand that. But all I can do for now is think of what he is doing right now, what he's thinking, wait till I can phone him, and dream of when we will see each other again. I sit here writing this wearing one of his shirts. The smell and feel of him encircles me.

      Does anyone really know with certainty what they want to do with their lives? Sometimes I think so, other times I think that people may know what they don't want in life and everything else they just have vague ideas about. I mean sure people say they want to become a certain profession, and have 4 kids, live in a certain country or city, but that's not what I mean. Do people know if they want to live their life helping people, or making people happy, making themselves happy, making money, being honest, being smart? I know that I don't want to stay here for the rest of my life, even for the next five years. I mean I love it here, but not for what this town is, I love it because it is home. I know that I want to find lasting love, I have found true love, but not lasting. Both people need to want love to last. I know that I want to be a mother. There is doubt whether that is physically able but the hope is still there. I know that I don't want to be viewed as normal and typical. I want to travel and have people think that I am intersting. I want to know as much about everything as I can. I want to help people, make people happy, make a difference. I want to die, having said my goodbyes in whatever form they might be. I do not want to go to sleep on any night feeling disgusted with myself, knowing that I let myself down. This is what I want from my life.

       The countdown to Ireland is getting shorter and shorter. I leave today for Quesnel, spending the weekend camping with the Boy, go to Vancouver on Monday, stay there, shop tuesday, depart vancouver at 4 in the afternoon en route to Dublin. We land in Dublin at 5 in the evening Thursday. B still wants to go techno dancing or something that night. Fine with me, but I think she'll be too tired.  I am very excited. It seems like whenever I go on a big trip, I think about it so much that when I actually leave it seems so surreal.    Speaking of surreal...my day yesterday was so insane. Rafiki and I went to the PGX, saw old teacher, looked at the animals...lots of jokes only her and I would appreciate followed. We didn't stay long. Headed over to the art gallery, got in free, rafiki fell down the steps, more laughter. We played in the kids area upstairs for a long time. Costumes, magnets, puppets...tehehe. ran through the sprinklers, got soaked, see through skirt...yeah. Layed on the grass, talked about sex, loosing innocence, the usual. rafiki and I are more alike in taht department now again. after a year. sad and not so.   I needed to say goodbye to Eevy. Even if he didn't come out for supper, I had to speak to him. I did. I was shaking. He felt awful about not coming for supper, he wasn't there, and since I'm leaving today, he wouldn't have time to. So I asked if he could take a break and get some coffee. Which has been a dream of mine forever, to go get coffee with him and just talk. Which is what happened. My skirt was still a bit wet and I was very self consious, which kinda made things uncomfortable, but still a dream fulfilled is always good. He is amazing. I kept thinking how crazy this is while he was talking I would just look...man you are so beautiful. We stayed there and talked for about half an hour, then he ahd to go back. Walked me to my car, and then there was that kinda akward few seconds when he stands close and you know he's gonna hug you, which I couldn't believe at teh time either, it all still seems like it didn't happen.  but it did and he did hug me, a one arm stiff hug, but still. I drove home with a huge grin on my face, my cheeks hurt afterwards. i will not tell M. he knows nothing about Eevy, and would ruin this for me completely. I don't need that and he doesn't need to know.   Got a phone call from my father. Also very weird. I think he was drunk. It has to have been that. He is never that happy. He told me 5 times to write him... and Dawn  from Ireland, and talked a whole bunch about how to go about homeschooling, so I'm assuming Dawn has a kid. He even laughed, he cracked jokes. That mike is the mike of my childhood, not the mike i've known these past 6 years. anyway everything seemed a little out of whack yesterday.   Watched the meteors night before last. Beautiful.   M's aunt said we can share his tent...wow. The first time i've been given permission to sleep with him. she's like well she's going away for a while so they'll want to ahve some time together, they can share the tent but I don't want to hear anything. Now I feel pressured, and I don't want to feel that. I want to still have a say in whether I want to or not. Whether I just want to sleep with him or  sleep   with   him . We'll see.    So I dont' think I will  be updating very much. Maybe I'll get a chance in Dublin or Galway. If not then I will be back on the 5th of september. If anyone actually reads this blog I will gladly tell them all about my trip. I probably will even if nobody reads it.   toodles

       So Father Dear showed up at our place at 10 to 8 in the morning.  Yeah.  The first time that i've seen him 2x in a year since he left...which was like 6 years ago. Anyway we lured him inside with coffee, and he managed to sit relatively still and grumpyless for a few hours....across from my mom which was even more amazing. Those two haven't been able to talk until a few years ago, and today they sat across the table from each other for upwards of an hour. We bummed around town for the whole day, Farmer's Market, China Cup, etc. When he lived here and I was Daddy's little girl, we always went to the pony club. He doesn't know what The Horse's death did to me and so we went there today. That's the closest to horses I've been in....9 months. That was sort of painful but more..exhilirating, maybe in a good way, maybe not. I don't really know. I want to ride sooooooo bad, it burns me up inside, burns, hurt,pain, tears, fuel, smell, betray, hear, hooprint, sawdust, hay, swish tail, gallop, drum, heart, tear, pain. It felt weird as always to be with Father Dear. The Familiar Stranger. The man I miss who isnt' the man I miss. I introduced him to M and Murray. That felt weird too. Murray and him talking; my two fathers. So to speak. Murray looked long and hard at me in that way of his.   I finally went to sna this weekend. Hour long instead of the 2 hours of yesteryear but better than missing it again. Saw mike-The Beard. How I miss that man. Rafiki wasn't there, but I hung out with Stino the whole time. She's having a "love" dilemma with Paul which I can't really help her with; I already went through a "love" thing with him. We had a bunch of time afterwards adn couldn't make up our minds as to what to do. Stino came up with the brilliant idea of...'let's go skinny dipping!!" All gung-ho (tehe) for that...except where? Nechako by the bridge is too shallow and people on the bridge can see, which you know I don't mind seeing as they will only see flashes of white in the dark, but still waht if some adventourous boys come down to see. Nope. Fraser? No. Current and where and ....it's not gonna work is it? no no it's not. We're not gonna see each other till september, so we've made it a date. Although that's gonna be bloody  cold.  Should be fun.   Anyway I am tired and kinda sad, just watched Frankie &amp; Johnny, still confused about me and M and all that involves, and... 12 more sleeps till Ireland!!!

       Last summer, when I hopped on this train which I am still riding,   I thought of this theory... Virginity is a state of mind . Now that things have...progressed, I wonder if I still think that. I was just picking blueberries in some wet weather outside and my mind was wandering. If virginity is a state of mind, let's say you are one of those saints, virgin, dedicating your life to God, get raped, in a martyr-ish way, and can you still live your virgin life? Seeing as you didn't lay down your virginity; it was taken. But if you did happen to lay down your virginity (stupidly)does that mean you can still be innocent; regain that innocence, later in life? Or even if you don't lose your virginity, that doesn't mean you aren't innocent. Or is virginity just a state of being? Is innocence lost forvever?   Speaking of which... urlLink August 1st is Lughnasadh , the old Celtic festival celebrating the first fruits of the harvest after the summer's work. Interesting to note, Lughnasadh was a time to make oaths, such as marriages, matchmaking and business deals.  Ironic. So very ironic. I wonder if there is a more binding oath than giving your body and your dreams and your purity to someone else. That someone didn't even realize it. The powerful mix of blood and seed and sweat. That magic moment lost in the damp dark rustling confines of a tent one Lughnasadh night. On Saturday night I couldn't sleep. I was remembering a year ago, wishing it never happened, wishing for things I can't have, glad to be alone. M didn't mention it of course. He doesn't even know what day it happend on. He doesn't know one of the three most important days of my life. This is too depressing.

       So I don't know what's going on with my blog I hope this post shows up alright. Things haven't been quite so boring and lazy around here anymore mainly becuase M was up for the long weekend, from friday unitl monday. That's the longest we've been together since June. Things weren't good. I don't know if it was just me, I have phases of being extremely annoyed at everything he does, or if he really is that annoying...my One Way Street Man. Things started on Tuesday as seen in my last post, and continued in like fashion for the rest of the weekend. Except, you know, if it were all fighting, or being mad, that's one thing. But it wasn't. It was, 'you piss me off so incredibly much it burns the deepest depths of my soul' and in the same hour : 'ohhhh man take me now, you shimmering god of my idolatry'...or something along those lines. And it gets so confusing, he throws me off my resolve so easily. aaaaargggggghhhh.    Stino, Rafiki, Troy, M, and I all met at sna on saturday which got canceled, so we headed down to Fort George park instead with a bunch of frisbees and blankets and immaturity. It also was a time of very mixed emotions. I find that when I am with a bunch of my friends I get...different...I laugh harder and run around more and am just...aahh. It seems like I can't jsut be myself with them. But it was also the first time that a bunch of us have hung out since june so that was awesome. We're all so brown, it's funny...well not M but he's inside all the time. And I got annoyed at him again that night. He likes to be...'physical' in little ways, and it makes me so uncomfortable becuase it makes all my friends uncomfortable. And when they're like...'' whoa...seen too much" or " that just makes me sick" that feels degrading. I feel so dirty and used in their eyes, and M doesnt realize it at all. Or if he does he'd just say taht they should screw themselves or something like that. Frick why am I with him...?       On to a different topic....14 sleeps till Ireland!!!! Yeah. I am very excited. But also a little scared. I still don't know why I want to go there for university, which would lead to living there and working there. What am I doing?? And this all means that in a year I will have moved out of the house! That means no more PG, no more mummy darling, no more running errands to the Hart, to more Nukko Lake sweet country community, no more PGX, no more stupid 94X, no more christmas wish lists, no more allowances, no more Chocolate Momma, or Rafiki, Stino, Futt Buzz, stupid Kelly Road, Drive-In, my sweet cat, this place which is home more than any place in which I've lived...and most of all no more M. ....and once again I make myself too sad, too confused.      I am finally learning how to spin. Yeah I know I sound old fashioned but I've always wanted to learn some "old arts" *giggle* and now I finally am. After the first day of almost wanting to throw the damn wheel out of the window...or off something since i was outside, the cursed wheel broke. Now I have a new one and had a short lesson which helped quite well. Now I can sort of spin. yay me. Tehehehe, something else to add to my dowry as Rafiki says. Along with my none existent goat and sheep. No cow just yet. My dowry for Eevy. lol. Eevy of the long hair and video aisle prowress. Eevy of the half-lidded brown eyes and smooth talk with the ladies. *swoon* .... Rafiki thinks I stalk him. I disagree. It's just that I happen to know an amazingly lot about him. His last name, which led to where he lives, which led to his phone number. I know what car he drives, which lets me know when he works. And most of the other stuff I know is just what he tells me. hehe B thinks taht we're meant to be together. Rafiki's view, " maybe you'll end up in the same old folk's home." ggrrr.
