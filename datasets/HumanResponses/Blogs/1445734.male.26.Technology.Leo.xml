      This is a sample post  Google is hoping to convince us to use its forthcoming Gmail service for our lifetime e-mail needs.   Once signed up to the Gmail system, every user gets a gigabyte of free Web-based e-mail storage. That's about 100 times the number of bits Microsoft's Hotmail accounts can hold.   It's a generous offer. But should we take Google up on it?   Right now, people who use Web-based e-mail can't squeeze that much in the cramped 4 megabytes or so that Google's competitors offer their nonpaying subscribers. What that means is that the impact of a security breach or privacy incident is sharply limited; your entire online life wouldn't be on public display in the case of one. With Gmail, on the other hand, you might have 20 years' worth of correspondence protected only by the thin shield of a password.   My concern is not about Google's management, who have been upstanding corporate citizens. They've maintained a firewall between advertising and search results, and have resisted the temptation to follow Yahoo's "paid inclusion" lead. Google has stood up to censorship and, in general, has alerted its readers when it's legally required to yank sites from its index.

      I've always wondered what extra does it take for an engineer to be as proficient and worth while as an MBA. I've found many answers and yup, we do need those institutions (Read IIM's et.al.) that embed the qualities that make a difference in the professional world that we are living. But some can be groomed on the job. Some cannot. Some come by experience. All I am saying is that at the end of the day how productive are you to the company, and how much are you benifitted after putting in your efforts, is what counts. To me an MBA with an engineering mind is the best bet in today's IT scenario. I don't have an MBA but I do keep my eyes open and try to imbibe those qualities which may not be existent in an engineer. I think an MBA without an engineering mind is like seeing stars while your tent is stolen. I got this in my inbox which depicts what I am trying to say, rightly...  A MBA and an Engineer go on a camping trip, set up their tent,and fell asleep.  Some hours later, the Engineer wakes his MBA friend. " Look up at the sky and tell me what you see."  The MBA replies, "I see millions of stars."   The Engineer asks "What does that tell you?"   The MBA ponders for a minute :   Astronomically speaking, it tells me that there are millions of  galaxies and potentially billions of planets.   Astrologically, it tells me that Saturn is in Leo.   Time wise, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three.   Theologically, it's evident the Lord is all-powerful and we are small and insignificant.   Meteorologically, it seems we will have a beautiful day tomorrow.   What does it tell you?"   The Engineer friend is silent for a moment, then speaks.   "Practically...Someone has stolen our tent".

      MSN Search's response to goglge.com   Sorry, no results were found containing "goglge.com"  Did you intend to go to one of these similar Web addresses?  * www.gogle.com * www.ggogle.com * www.goglee.com    (via  urlLink OK-CANCEL )   That hints for the rivalry  urlLink MSN  has with  urlLink Google . Can't get further than this. Can it?

      This is one question that all believers ask themselves at one point or the other in their esteemed present life. I for one started to stop believing that I had a previous life. Aka. incarnation. I don't believe it. That's my current stand for that topic which is known to be esoteric amongst most reason-oriented geeks like me. Beliefs apart, I love this nice program which supposedly tells you about your past life. Just input your date of birth and boom....there you go...    urlLink http://www.thebigview.com/pastlife/    Its always interesting to know and read fantasy stories. For I love to imagine the history.

      Had been to watch Spidy-2 on a cheerful saturday evening. Didn't have any hopes that 'll get tickets. Tried getting one through people who sell black tickets. No one had. At the parking lot, at the security, gatekeeper, no one had. Hardly 2 mins left for the show. No tickets. Thought would wait and try to get one for the night show.  A guy appeared from no where and asked - "Do you need balcony tickets?" "At what cost?" "Dont worry sir, its not black. No. not a black ticket. Ill give you corner seats. Come with me" Got into the theatre's ticket room. The guy got us two tickets, corner seats in the centre, same window price. Thanked him and rushed into the movie hall. Was wondering still these kinda interesting things happen at the movie theatres. Why?  Spidey-2 was fabulous. A nice story, emotions, nice and slick special effects, good action sequences, especially the train stopping one. A good overall family entertainer. Kids would love this one, all the time. Happened to see a kid enjoying in the movie hall with his spidey outfit on. Cute kid that he is...

      Got to read this piece today on  urlLink Smita's blog , in one of the comments posted by someone called Bims. Quite inspirational. Wish I had read it when I was in such situations in the past. Worth a read anywaz. Thanks Bims.  After awhile you learn the subtle difference Between holding a hand and chaining a soul. And you learn that love doesn't mean security, And you begin to learn that kisses aren't contracts And presents aren't promises. And you begin to accept your defeats with you head up and your eyes open. With the grace of maturity, not the grief of a child. And you learn to build all your roads on today Because tomorrow's ground is too uncertain for plans, And futures have a way of falling down in mid-flight. After awhile you learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much. So you plant your own garden and decorate your own soul, Instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers. And you learn that you really can endure... That you really are strong And that you really do have worth. And you learn and learn and learn...

      Bangalore may have become only the second modern city in the world to be turned into a verb - after Shanghaied, a word that broadly means to force -thanks to the outsourcing controversy.   An online anti-outsourcing website is marketing a T-shirt with the legend "Don't Get Bangalored," a term suggesting losing one's job to outsourcing. The T-shirts, in two separate designs, are priced at $ 15.99. The word has already found a place in online discussions. "I am a software developer who is about to be 'bangalored.' Fine. I am not going to pout about it," a participant in the forum Technewsworld wrote this week. "The media writes that we are in a global economy so deal with it. Okay, I will." If the word sticks around, then it will quite likely make the annual addition to various dictionaries. Although there have been other geographical places that have been turned into words (called toponyms; eg Frankfurter, Marathon, Balkanization, Finlandized, Detroit), few cities have taken a verb form.  Bangalore itself is already associated with a torpedo which was devised by a British army captain in 1912. Bangalore Torpedos were used to clear barbed wire entanglements in World War II, especially in the D-Day landings, and are in use even today. But Americans are being ribbed even while trying make a few bucks of the outsourcing controversy. On a separate forum, an Indian named "Harish" joked that $ 15.99 was too high a price for a T-shirt and suggested the manufactured be outsourced.   A separate website of American info-tech professionals sells an even pricier T-shirt ($ 19.99) that reads "My Job Went To India And All I Got Was A Stupid T-Shirt."  The T-shirt flap aside, Bangalore has certainly entered the American lexicon.  Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry recently suggested at a meeting that he wanted American cities to be wired like Bangalore, perhaps not realizing that for all its vaunted reputation, the city has dismal connectivity.

      Got this info from a friend in my inbox today. Guess I need to follow this to reduce my stress level as well. Be quite helpful if you spend long hours at your office desk.    I do not know how many of you would actually do it. But, I thought the information was priceless, hence am forwarding it to all my dear ones. think about it........  This will save your life, as life is not worth living without the eyes. During a recent visit to an optician, one of my friends was told of an exercise for the eyes by a specialist doctor in the US that he termed as 20-20-20." It is apt for all of us (and also guys who send many mails), who spend long hours at our desks, looking at the computer screen. I Thought I'd share it with you. 20-20-20   Step I: After every 20 minutes of looking into the computer screen, turn your head and try to look at any object placed at least 20 feet away. This changes the focal length of your eyes, a must-do for the tired eyes.   Step II: Try and blink your eyes for 20 times in succession, to moisten them.   Step III: Time permitting of course, one should walk 20 paces after every 20 minutes of sitting in one particular posture. Helps blood Circulation for the entire body.   Please circulate among your friends if you care for them and their eyes. Your eyes r mirror of your soul, so do take care of them, they are priceless.............

      Looks like this was expected..There is this time where I was sitting reading some material or trying to get a hang of some knowledge base articles on C#, and I was expecting something to come my way. Now I've been asked to do a feasibility study and estimate for a new ASP.Net project that's coming up. Lot of simple things are to be sorted out in this. Let me see how I do it. Couple of days is all I have.  AutoRickshaw meter reading is 10Rs, whenever I get down during my commute to office and back home. Today once it was 12.50Rs and once 11:00Rs. Wonder why incorrect meters always are defective on the +ve side and not -ve. I only managed to give 10 bucks to the rick guy, explaining him that the rick meter has an incorrect reading. And that was for the 2Kms commute - office to/from home.  My travel is still on hold status. No signs of which way its gonna turn. I may go back to Sydney or may not. I am fine either way on the outlook, but would prefer staying back here and wait for another opporunity.

      Hurrahhhh !!!! Thanks to TP and my message on  urlLink Orkut . Finally I got to setup a GMail account, what I've been waiting for since April 1st. I've already imported all my contacts from Yahoo, Plaxo et.al on to GMail. Alas ! figured out that hotmail doesn't have options to export my contact list. Any pointers?

      Due to increased and unmanageable comment spamming at my Moveable type site, I have decided to move back to blogger. That way I can also save some money on hosting and the like. Savings apart, my blogging apatite is back and I will be looking forward to post regularly and interestingly way forward.  &nbsp; I am also gonna be updating my blogroll and would have new blogroll that I strictly use and not one and all as we used to have previously just for the heck of it.  &nbsp; Let me see how far I go.

      I found this text on  urlLink History News Network 's discussion threads. It quite reflects my idea of theory behind pyramids and ancient civilisation. Being an avid history follower, I always believed that the academic history that we know, learnt in academics is authentic yet incomplete, scientific yet untrue. Startling revelations are yet to be made in what we know as HISTORY. Mark my words.  The exsistance of the pyramids indeed reign as the greatest enigma of modern man. The question is who built them, when, and for what purpose ? The facts are many , yet conclusions remain elusive. My opinion is as follows.   In millenia past - say 5000- 10,500 BCE there exsisted on Earth an advenced ciziliztion of man. A civilization highly advanced in astronomy, mathematics, agriculture, and other high skills. These people were keenly aware of the astronomy of their day and knew that a catastrophe was impending on their very survival. Cometary impact destroyed this civilization, but not before they where able to create the edifices that prove their exsistance to us now, yet continue to be shrouded in mystery.   In a global catastrophe, the magnitude of which has not been even remotely witnessed since, the advancement of these peoples was brought to an end. Survivors there where, but few in number and lost in a world of climactic upheaval. As time passed, these survivors repopulated , first along coastal waterways, then further , across the expanses of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.   The Pyramids of old still stood. Shaken yes, but intact, and served as a reminder to the surviving hoardes that greatness had been achieved in time past, and the future of mankind, at least in the primative sacle was preserved. THe enigma of the pyramids spread throughout the world, where on each continent they where revered , and though of as places of worship and or burial / sacrifice. The tomb theory of Zahi Hawass and the Egyptian governemnet is true to the extent that the purpose of the pramids to these later survivor races was indeed as stated.   The current theory on the data regarding the dating of the sphinx helps to illustrae this point. Being not omnly built in laborious stages, but also showing signs of water, not wind, erosion do much for the case of erection from antiquity. To me it seems rather obvious that the buliders of the oldest pyramids where well in advacne of the current theory as far as civilization is concerned. THe argument for ancient civilizations will not be settled any time soon I fear.   I look forward to any comments

      We saw Google in Circa 1960. Now here is Google in 2005.   urlLink Google in 2005   Looks interesting? Or absurd?  PS: abusrd, we are talking about  urlLink invisible tabs  here.  GoogleGuy says :-  I thought it was really, really funny. Nice to see people taking google back to the future. :) Has anyone seen Danny Sullivan's slide ("google in 2010", or something like that)? It's a google front page with like 30 tabs. Also pretty funny..

      Couldn't post something for the last couple of days. Was amidst something which took some good amount of energy and efforts at work. So all set and will be back to Sydney this week. Same people, same place, same but more work on the anvil. Looking forward for a very good experience atleast this time. Atleast would like to have no hassles, tension free trip this time. Hope it works out that way. For my last two trips to sydney weren't as great as I expected them to be. As many of my blog readers know when it comes to Nature, short trips, photography I've enjoyed the most in those 6 months, but they were never tension-free. Hassles, follow-ups and more. To a certain extent life's challenges are good to face and are healthy. But they shouldn't really get burdensome and take some toll on you. That's what has been happening since a while. Looking forward to a good trip. This time around in all probability I might be flying over Kaulalumpur, which is different than last time. Enough of Singapore. Let me see some new place, rather airport atleast. I always loved Malay language. Its more soothening to ears than chinese or japanese somehow. Don't know why. People not sure as yet. Let me see.. Will update once I get settled back in Sydney.   Wish me more luck this time. Cheers....
