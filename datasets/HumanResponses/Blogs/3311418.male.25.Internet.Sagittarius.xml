Mobile operators are selling much-improved services that help users locate friends or get directions to the nearest train station, but they have to fight off consumers' bad memories from 2000 and 2001, when they offered illegible maps on tiny black-and-white screens.

        urlLink Photos Show Rape of Iraqi Women by US Occupation Forces     Please Note: Many of the photographs showing the rape of Iraqi women and the sodomization of Iraqi POW's at the Abu Ghraib prison are now at USA pornographic websites pointing to the possibility of collusion between the depraved US soldiers in the pictures and US based Jewish pornographers. Many of these photographs were also freely disseminated to US occupation forces, perhaps to inflame their nefarious desires and to motivate them to strike out against the Iraqi populace in these perverse ways.)       The release, by CBS News, of the photographs showing the heinous sexual abuse and torture of Iraqi POW's at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison has opened a Pandora's box for the Bush regime. Apparently, the suspended US commander of the prison where the worst abuses took place, Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, has refused to take the fall by herself and has implicated the CIA, Military Intelligence and private US government contractors in the torturing of POW's and in the raping of Iraqi women detainees as well.    Photo 1    Photo 2    Photo 3   Photo 4   Comments By Me:   Okay so this is what the fuckin American Soldiers doing their fuckin shit stuff out there? This is the war against terrorism, pardon my spelling and fuckin grammar coz it is not my mother tongue.   I am here in USA for last two years, really like the people here, specially cali people are very nice, some how I start thinkin by lookin at the neat and clean streets, proper system of banking, the nice StarBucks , the yummy Burger King, and Westfield Shopping Malls around my home, they are so superb! and the traffic system is awesome! but hey! what happened to their soldiers? i mean come on, soldiers , army military are all made by those people who are American? So what happened to them? Ain't they know one thing that "Human Being Respect" is the primary objective of any war? I am muslim, we are not terrorist, we are not doing any kind of barbaric stuff.  We learn how to be human since we are in craddle, how to behave how to react on anger how to make our god damn mind when we are confused , how to make the nice neighborhood, how to interact with the muslim and non-muslim ... only in Human way... and only in nice way! we must be nice , thats what Islam taught us. It is not about "You are Non-Muslim" and "I am Muslim" ... the religon teaches us "We are all Human" ... "So Be Nice!"   But hey they are American soldiers, they are super power eh? Well lets wait and see, God is there and He is watching each and everything whatever is hidden and whatever is revealed... ;)  hope things will be fine in couple of years!

There is some evidence that the invading US forces were provided with amphetamines and pornographic materials to incite their thorough ravaging of Baghdad.

        urlLink Worst rape photos of Iraqi women detainees not yet officially released The new photographs released today of the depraved sexual abuse of Iraqi POW's by the US Military Police on orders of CIA and Israeli operatives at the Abu Ghraib prison still do not show the worst of the war crimes. The photographs so far officially released are, without exception, only of male Iraqi prisoners of war. According to returning Mexican-American soldiers and staff members of Congressmen who have viewed the videos and photographs in private sessions, there are far more shocking photographs that have not been released to the public. Senator Richard J. Durbin himself said "There were some awful scenes. It felt like you were descending into one of the rings of hell, and sadly it was our own creation". Other members of Congress said, after viewing the images, that they included Iraqi women exposing their breasts and other private parts. Congressman Martin T. Meehan said, ''I was obviously shocked and horrified to discover that the new photos are even more gruesome than those we have seen in the media. Some of the pictures and videos show actual intercourse between male and female soldiers." In addition, the May 10-17 issue of Newsweek said that yet-unreleased Abu Ghraib abuse photos "include an American soldier having sex with a female Iraqi detainee and American soldiers watching Iraqis have sex with juveniles."

        urlLink "How will it be done?" is heard in the Nick Berg decapitation video! Los Angeles, Alta California - May 19, 2004 - (ACN) With the overwhelming evidence that has now accumulated proving that the Nicholas Berg decapitation video is a fraud, it is time to call for an international inquiry into the crime. Besides the evidence that the video was actually filmed at the Abu Ghraib prison as outlined in a prior article titled, "Berg decapitation video was filmed inside the Abu Ghraib prison", La Voz de Aztlan has, in addition, completed a sound analysis and isolated about 10 seconds of the sound track at the end of the video. A western voice saying "How will it be done?" can be clearly heard after two shouts of "Allahu Akbar". "How will it be done?" is heard after a gap of silence and after the last "Allahu Akbar". It looks like the "editors" in their haste to complete the bogus video for propaganda purposes have left a lot of evidence behind. The voice left inadvertently in the video can be heard on this web page. The short wave file can be repeated by refreshing the web page.

        urlLink Berg decapitation video was filmed inside the Abu Ghraib prison : "Berg decapitation video was filmed inside the Abu Ghraib prison"  There is now ample evidence that the video showing the decapitation of 26 year old Nicholas Berg of Philadelphia by purported Al queda members is a complete fraud. The real Nick Berg may or may not be dead, but the heavily edited video is nothing but a fake. This is the conclusion of La Voz de Aztlan after a frame by frame analysis and the conclusion of hundreds of film, medical and other experts world wide who downloaded, viewed and analyzed the video as well. Literally thousands of persons world wide requested the video, which is rapidly disappearing from the Internet, after our news service published "Nick Berg decapitation video declared a fraud by medical doctor" on Wednesday May 12 and which was linked by other independent news services on the World Wide Web.

       Hi! All,  Thought loads of stuff have been told about Al-Qaida and Islam , there relationship in particular.  Let me clear few things from our way shall we?  Is Al-Qaida is really following the Islamic law of Jihad? so the thing is what exactly does Jihad mean?  the answer is as follow:    One of the commonest terms known of Islam, it is often misunderstood. The term Jihad comes from the Arabic root 'jahada' meaning 'to struggle'. The most famous use of the word Jihad is as 'Holy War', and Islamic guerrillas fighting state authority in various Muslim countries use it freely to describe their struggles (please note, the one who are killing innocent civilians are not obeying the Islamic Law of War). The fighter who fights a Jihad - a Mujahid - is believed to go straight to Paradise if he dies and his enemy will go straight to Hell.  But Muslims point out that the term has a much wider significance, meaning any kind of struggle which has spiritual significance. Giving up smoking can count as Jihad, for example, or controlling one's temper. In Islamic theology, these struggles inside the personality are termed 'the Greater Jihad' and struggles with outside forces such as state power or tyrannical armies 'the lesser Jihad'.  All the same, the culture of Jihad and the 'martyrs' or shuhada it produces is pervasive in some Muslim countries. In the Palestinian territories, for example, during the Intifadah against Israeli occupation, such as was the prestige of dying as a 'shaheed' or martyr that even those who died in car accidents who had nothing to do with the political situation were termed 'shuhada' by their relatives.      This is the excerpt from : GEORGE JOFFE from his website  urlLink Political Islam   Now read this:  Like Christianity, Islam permits fighting in self-defense, in defense of religion, or on the part of those who have been expelled forcibly from their homes. It lays down strict rules of combat that include prohibitions against harming civilians and against destroying crops, trees and livestock. As Muslims see it, injustice would be triumphant in the world if good people were not prepared to risk their lives in a righteous cause.  One reads in the Qur'an: "Fight in the cause of God against those who fight you, but do not transgress limits. God does not love transgressors." (Qur'an 2:190)  "And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for God. But if they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrongdoers." (Qur'an 2:193)  "If they seek peace, then you seek peace. And trust in God for He is the One that hears and knows all things." (Qur'an 8:61)  War is therefore the last resort, and is subject to the rigorous conditions laid down by the sacred law. The often misunderstood and overused term jihad literally means "struggle" and not "holy war" (a term not found anywhere in the Qur'an). Jihad, as an Islamic concept, can be on a personal level--inner struggle against evil within oneself; struggle for decency and goodness on the social level; and struggle on the battlefield, if and when necessary.  Source:  urlLink Islamic Web    Do you think Islam allow the so called Al-Qaida "Jihad" , when the Islam says NO means no, so Islam is sayin no to the killing of innocents. So how come I or any sensible person , sensible Human can call Islamic Terrorist? You have to decide yourself what u gonna say next time when u gonna hear Islamic Militants... I am sure you will say "Terrorist" or "Militants".   What are the Islamic Laws for Wars and comparision of International Law concerning Wars:  Islam permits war but keeps it within the limits of mercy at which the twentieth century civilization has not yet been able to arrive, not even to come near to. Islam has set down certain rules, the most merciful and considerate to people, and required people to observe them.  Such rules go in line with the principles of international law in many ways, but differ in that they are divine rules legalized through religion and executed through the faith of Muslims. The principle of international law lack this authority that ensures putting them into practical effect. Scholars even say that considering international rules as laws is a kind of leniency. A law is a law only when it is supported by some force that ensures its performance, and there is no such force for international law. The Muslim rules, though they aim at justice and mercy, have the faith of Muslims as an authority to ensure their being carried out.  A. International law determines that the citizens who are not regular members of an army are not considered as fighters, and hence should not be inflicted with harm; only regular soldiers (or armed men engaged in a war) are considered as fighters.  The Shariiah agrees on this point, for the Qur'an says: "Fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not transgress limits. God loveth not transgressors" (2:190). It is an act of transgression to when believers fight those who do not fight them, people like their enemy's children and wives, as well as their sick, old and clergy.  In the Raid of Mu'tah, the Prophet instructed his men, while about to set on, "Never kill a woman, a weak infant, or a debilitated old person; nor burn palms, uproot trees, or pull down houses!"  B. International law forbids killing the wounded, torturing the enemy, destroying them by treachery or deception, or using bombs, missiles or weapons which add to their torture. It also prohibits the poisoning of wells, rivers and foods; it recommends that the corpses of the dead be respected, and prohibits any severity or mayhem be inflicted on them, regardless of the nationality of dead people.  Islam applies the same principles, for when the Prophet appointed an army or troop leader he instructed him to be always God-fearing, and added: "Never transgress limits, or take your enemy by surprise or perfidy, or inflict atrocities or mutilation, or kill infants!"  Abu Bakr, the first Caliph in Islam, instructed his senior officer Oussama, saying, "Never betray, or transgress your limits, or take the enemy by surprise or perfidy, or inflict atrocities or mutilation upon them; nor kill young babies or old people or women; and never injure or burn palms or cut down a fruitful tree, or slay a sheep, a cow or a camel unless it is for your food!"  C. International law prescribes a number of principles regarding the proper treatment of captives. They should not be killed, injured, ill-treated or humiliated if they surrender or if they are deprived of their freedom.  Islam also urges on the polite treatment of captives in general, and God commends the righteous who treat such people hospitably, saying: "And they feed, for the love of God, the indigent, the orphan, and the captive, (saying), 'We feed you for the sake of God alone; no reward do we desire from you, nor thanks'" (76:8-9).  The Prophet was generous to his captives, but in return fir his setting them free he asked them to teach Muslim infants writing.    So do you think at any point the recent  urlLink Beheading of American  by Militant is justifiable by sayin coz it is lawful by Islam? I dont think and no muslim approve this! coz it is totally Animal kind of stuff, and Islam teach us to be HUMAN and be peaceful!

You will get a grid that displays data in set of pages. The default paging mechanism of Datagrid will display page numbers either numerically (i.e. 1,2,3) or as Next and Prev links. This article will explain how to change this and implement a paging mechanism, which displays page numbers in a combo box and first, prev, next and last links similar to the pager hot mail.

The World Wide Web and electronic mail have become very common to our life, and it's our duty to tell the story behind their creation to our children and grandchildren. More importantly, as the importance of a technology increases, so does its usage--and thus the need that we'll need to understand what's happening at the protocol level in order to debug and/or diagnose problems. To do that, we need to understand how to work with sockets at the most primitive level, and to speak and understand the SMTP and HTTP protocols "in the raw". Fortunately, Internet protocols aren't all that hard to understand. As I took a closer look at SMTP and HTTP for the first time, I was surprised how simple they are.

The techniques work in both pre-production and released systems.

Not just is much design activity ridiculed as 'Big Up Front Design', but such design techniques as the UML, flexible frameworks, and even patterns are de-emphasized or downright ignored. In fact XP involves a lot of design, but does it in a different way than established software processes. XP has rejuvenated the notion of evolutionary design with practices that allow evolution to become a viable design strategy. It also provides new challenges and skills as designers need to learn how to do a simple design, how to use refactoring to keep a design clean, and how to use patterns in an evolutionary style.

To see what I mean, just check out the boxes on the left-hand side of Amazon.com, or the boxes on the left-hand side on DataWebControls.com.  Creating such a rounded corner interface isn't terribly difficult.  Essentially, you use a graphics editing program to create the rounded corners.  Then, use an HTML   with three columns to display the left corner, the middle, and the right corner .... from Scott's Blog :)
