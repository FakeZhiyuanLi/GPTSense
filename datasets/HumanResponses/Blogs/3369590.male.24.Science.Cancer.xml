      Today I'm going to rant about everybodys favorite subject:  terrorism.  Specifically terrorists and the overuse of the word.  I've noticed a significant rise in the use of this word since 911.  No suprise about that.  My problem is that it has increasingly been used as a general synonyme for "bad guy."  No doubt this missuse has been exasserbated by our wonderfully rhetoric president.  Bush calls everyone who disagrees with him a terrorist, liberals call Bush a terrorist, Iraqis call us terrorists, Microsoft calls Linux users terrorists, and the meaning of the word seems to have been lost.  Let's get one thing streight, a terrorist is someone or some group or corperate entity that attempts to use fear and doubt as a weapon to accomplish a political objective.  The IRA and PLO are terrorist orgaizations.  They attempt to create a climate of fear in order to accomplish political freedom.  Recently Libia has decided to give up it's WMD program.  The Bush administration has indicated that that was the intended goal of the Iraqi war.  If so that means that they attacked Iraq in order to create a climate of fear in other countries with WMD programs with the political goal of getting them to shut down their WMD programs.  ie, terrorists.   That's not a bad thing.  Most states and many organizations engage in terrorist activities from time to time because fear is a legitimate weapon to use.  In fact it is far preferable to use fear to accomplish your objective than to use violence.  At least with fear you usually end up with usable people on the other side.  Al Queada is not, I suspect, a terrorist organization.  They are definately Bad Guys, but I confess to a suspission that their goal is not to cause fear, but to kill people.  Similarly, whenever I argue about the Isreal/Palastein situation with my liberal friends, they play the sure-the-Palastinians-are-terrorists-but-so-is-Isreal card.  The Isreali government can be and often is murderous and zealous, but if they were attempting to win through causing fear, they would use different tactics.  My point is that not all terrorists are bad guys, and not all bad guys are terrorists.  Confusing the two is incorrect and paints a very dangerous picture of the world.

      I should probably introduce myself and say a bit about what I'm trying to do here.  My name is Josh and I am a Graduate in molecular biology soon to be starting graduate school.  Politically I consider myself an Objectivist, but other objectivists would probably rip out my throat with their teeth if they heard me say so.  Think of me as a libertarian on sterroids with occasional flashes of sanity.  I intend to use this blog to sound off some ideas that I've had, but been rather reluctant about sharing in polite company.  Some of what I post here will likely offend some people.  I would hardly be doing my job if it didn't.  Bear in mind that I don't necessarily believe in all the ideas I espouse here, at least not all the time.  I appreciate your feedback though I will ignore flames and I don't promise to read your insightful comments either, it depends on how busy I am.  Also note that despite being a general technophile, I have never done a blog before and don't actually know how these things work, though the user interface seems easy enough here.    I will probably post here about whatever has pissed me off lately, generally something political or scientific in nature.  I will also use it to put forth my views on some issues that I probably am not qualified to have views on.    I know my spelling is bad.  Don't send me corrections.  I know I'm a heartless bastard.  Consider me already chastised.  Other comments are welcome.  Josh
