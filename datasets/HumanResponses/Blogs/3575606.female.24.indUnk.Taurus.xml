      How come everybodys gotta go away?For some reason everyone just disappears..for no reason.I dont get it.What did I do that was so bad?Its really fucking hard to type.I cut the shit out of my finger the other day.Yup got me 5 stitches.It hurt so bad.I cried and said the "f" word over and over and jumped up and down thinking it would stop and I kept bleeding everywhere.It looked like someone had gotten shot.made me very lightheaded...Oh well its patched up.And tho I cant move it really, it still somehow hurts like hell.

      I had to see the Raggedy Ann reject once again.Damn trailer trash whore.I had to make food for her cos she came to my work..I made it all nice and pretty and charged her a very obscene amount of money for a medium pepperoni pizza.She of course didnt pay the full price cos I didnt want to see her fucking ugly face so I had to have someone else check her out cos yeah...I hate her..I mean I stood close by there but I didnt have to speak to her or almost touch her hand while giving her change back.Other than that I was late to work.Was behind most of the day.Felt like puking all day long.Wanted to go to sleep.Couldnt.I wanted to talk to somebody but I didnt.I dropped some boiling hot spaghetti sauce on my leg and now I have this huge red burn mark down my leg..yeah..really sexy.Guys will be all over me.All cos of the big red mark on my leg.Shit I feel all itchy.Something really fucking awesome better happen tomorrow or at least sometime this week to make up for the shittyness Im feeling now!  Damn you bastard damn you to hell!

      Thinking gives me a headache.I hate to think, but then again, I love to think.Im thinking Im confused.And I think people make me think and make me confused and give me a headache.Im not totally sure what to say.I dont know what to think.Thinking of what to think blows.What if I should never think again?Im not gonna do that cos of reasons.I just dont get some people to the point that all I do is think about them and why the hell they do some of the things they do.Im not obsessive just curious.People make me curious just like they give me a headache.HMMMMMMMM.I dont understand how sometimes you have friends and sometimes you have no friends.One day people like you, the next day they hate you.What can ya do?Not a damn thing.One of the most uncool things in the world.Wow I just now almost fell asleep.I dont like it when people do that shit.Not fall asleep, but choose days to like people and dislike people.I know it happens cos I used to do it myself.But I was just stupid.Im not anymore.I just dont get it.Ive done something wrong.I dont know what I did.I really wish someone would explain it to me!Shit.Is it really that difficult?What the hell?Shit my head hurts.

If I have its gone away very quickly.Im starting to think there is no such thing as "happy" "loving" "cheerful" "lucky".Theyre all words used as some sort of hmm..drug maybe,in my life so that I will keep thinking something great is going to happen but it doesnt.Its a joke.Theres nothing for me.

       Second attempt at going to sleep..Failed.Of course I knew that was gonna happen.OHshit ya know what I just really dont get???Why do couples with AOL use each others screen names???Whats the fucking point?Are they that insecure?Or just bein lame?I think its really stupid.Something else that totally blows..Is that weve been having awesome sex weather the past few days and I cant get laid.It really pisses me off..I may have to start asking for volunteers for things like that.I dunno.

       haha..yeah Id slice someones ear off.So I guess I should have ate something earlier..but Im a loser and I didnt so now its been nearly two to three days.I still feel like Im gonna puke a little.Not so much.But enough to make me not want to eat.Oh well...most of today sucked my ass.Actually all of it.Im totally convinced everyone just really fucking hates me and Im kinda not likin them all that much either.I guess in the end it evens out.I dunno what Im talking about.Im becoming delierious.I should just go to sleep.Yup I should do that since SOMEBODY has a crappy computer and wont kick it like I said and SOMEBODY cant talk to me anymore cos they wont kick their computer...I have no one to talk to.Bummer.I attempted to talk to some "OKC" persons..basically they had nothing to say except they all suck.I refuse to be on a first name basis with THAT many people I dont actually talk to in "real life".Damn..Bambi came back.Again..I guess she doesnt want to stay at her OWN home..haha shes a goober.But whatever.So I gueess Ill go to my sleeping place now.Which would be my bed.Cos thats where I sleep.Yup.Sometimes if Im watching tv I may fall asleep on the couch or the floor..but usually my bed.With my most awesome Sailor Moon sheets and comforter and matching pillow case.

Nope..it cant ever go away.Bein sick sucks only I dont really think Im sick. just depressed.Kinda.Maybe not.Ok yeah Im sad.A little.Angry at someone possibly others.I wish my tummy would stop hurting it makes sleeping very uncomfortable.I just think some people should stop pissing me off.Yup.They should.I was having a pretty gosh darn good week too...and then this.Stupid motherfucker.

       I was right.Today is pretty shitty.So far anyhow.I wanted to go someplace but its raining and this place is kinda far and I dont feel like driving in the rain.Dammit..the viewing guide thing says Blue's Clues is supposed to be on but its not.Damn damn damn.Oh well Joe was probably gonna be on there anyways.I dont like Joe.Im kinda really fucking pissed.If I wasnt before I definately am now.No reason really.Yeah right..theres always something.What the hell?Not only is Blue's Clues not on like it said..But Rugrats are on and Ive seen this episode twice already today.Even more reason to be pissed.Now I have a tummy ache.The kind that makes your head hurt.And your knees ache.And makes you feel like puking.Puke until you cant puke anymore and your eyes are all watery and your throat is burning and vomit came out of your nose and it stinks and its all chunky in your nose.And so you have to gargle with water to get the burning feeling out of your throat.And try to blow the chunks out of your nose.And when youre done you just fucking hate everyone around you cos they all fucking suck.

       I woke up way too early.Even tho I didnt have to.I just sat there and watched tv.Yup I watched Mommie Dearest.Faye Dunaway is so freaking ugly.Not just as Joan Crawford..just as Faye herself.Shed creep me out if she were my mom.Well I guess I wouldnt know anything different so it wouldnt matter.But if I were little and my friends mom looked like her..Id probably run and hide when she was around.I also watch Malibu's Most Wanted.Hahaha..it was on HBO or somechannel like that.I also have it on dvd.Its so fuckin dumb but it isnt.I dunno I think its swell.OHHHKAAAYY....SO I had a pretty super awesome day mostly.Unusual...difficult to explain.No problems tho.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its a secret and I cant say.Tomorrow is going to suck tho I just know it.well maybe not and Id rather it didnt.I have no plans tho and no money and no friends so..I bet it will suck for the most part.Im actually really tired.I hope I am able to go to sleep that would rule.I just dont wanna dream about anything.I had the saddest dream last night.It sucked..it was so vivid.It depressed me.Its probably why I couldnt go back to sleep and woke up so fucking early in the morning.I didnt want to remember it but..oh well...I really do need to get some of that waterproof mascara remover before I pull out all of my eyelashes with this shitty turbo boost whatever.

      AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Id so rather be anywhere else right now than this house with all these shitty people.Yes theyre my family but..damn...I feel like I should pass out some Valiums.Xanax even.Did I spell that right?I dunno.My cousin has the loudest kid ever.Hes over a year old and all he does is walks around and screams and screams and cries and its very aggravating.Aside from all of that..I think my blowdryer just tried to electricute me.I was sparking pretty bad.It didnt smell or anything just sparks started coming out of it.So now I have to wait for my hair to air dry.Which sucks cos its going to take forever and a day.Maybe longer.Im not sure.It smells good tho.My hair I mean.Cos I washed it.Yeah.With shampoo.Some berry scented kind.Yeah.So there.Huh?

      Ok well I think Im just abou totally finished playing "depressed loser self pitying drama queen"   :)      YAY!!!! Were going to the park today.As soon as someone stops being a lazy ass and watching tv.Soooooooooo...Its my day off..Eh I hope anyways cos if not Imma be in a lot of trouble.No ones called yet but then again if I werent off today, I would probably just now be getting there..This hair color totally sucks.I tried to wash it out and it wont work but its like too bright to just dye over it and even if I could do that,it just wouldnt look rigt cos its too fucking bright!!!Fortunately I can blame it on someone else.Cos if I had picked it out myself,it wouldnt be so bright.Not this time anyhow.DAMMIT I just wanna drive someplace!Its too bad for me that the car I have is a piece of shit and feels like its going to fall apart at any moment.I want my own car back like right now.Thats not going to happen tho cos its gonna cost way too much to be fixed..Damned car radio thieves.

      Oh happy day!Ha maybe not.Not too bad tho.Well..actually..that one thing happened..yeah at work.I had to leave and come all the way home.Which wasnt too bad cos it was nice to not be at work.So I went back and thats about it.Then of course,I came home and went to sleep.When I woke up, I dyed my cousins hair.Yup put some blonde chunks in it.I dyed my hair too..it was supposed to be streaks but didnt turn out so well but..I dont care.My hair just sucks.And ICED TEA RULES!Yeah!Rock on tea! oOOOOOHHH Linda gave me my money back..well kinda.I gotta go pick it up from her tomorrow cos she hasnt cashed her check yet.I wasnt even really worried about it.Linda rules,I trust her.Im sure she will pay me back.I dont know why I keep mentioning it.Maybe cos shes my only friend and its the one thing other than work that I can think of right now.Oh how sad.So...I think I need about 75 bucks to for certain expenses..and everything will be good to go for quite a while..assuming neither Maya or myself gets sick. Ball and Chain?Isnt that a Social Distortion song? Im thinking it is. Ah well.

      Somewhere between here and there I kinda got this strange feeling like I temporarily slipped out of reality.The sun was super bright.The sky and the clouds looked matte kinda like a painting.I was driving and it just felt really fake.Other cars on the road were moving like they were floating.Gliding maybe.I dunno.There were cows but they werent really moving at all, not that they are usually extremely active but the grass and little hills made it look like it wasnt real.I saw a few cars just parked on the side of the road.One car by the lake.Their stillness just seemed eerie.I didnt actually see anybody at all.Just other drivers as they drifted past me and I drifted past them.I didnt really look at them tho, I never do.Ever since that day with the guy with his pants off.....yeah..I didnt really look before then, just the one time..and BAM!&nbsp; nasty pervert..Anyhow.It was weird.I felt like something super cool happened or was just about to happen.Uh not still talking about the old pantless perv.But nothing happened I dont think.Maybe it did Im just tired or something.I dunno.I havent been outside since then..it might look bad.Not fake anymore.Back to being normal and not so interesting.I see it all of the time so I guess it gets boring..same road almost same cars same people..ya know........

      I feel like I try too hard.Even tho it doesnt seem like it.Cos I dunno why..its just one of those really weird things that only happens to people like me. For instance..when I first opened my checking account...it took a whole month for them to actually send my checks and then I never got my checking card haha because the place that makes the cards "ran out of plastic".Yes.They ran out of plastic.Or any day now Im going to be the one dipshit that gets a ticket for running a stop sign in a parking lot at 3 am when there is absolutely no one else around..in a dark parking lot..just taking a short cut.Now I totally forget what I was thinking in the first place.Either way Im bout to piss my pants.Yes.Piss.Oh yes and of course the moment I decide to go pee..so does everyone else in the damn house.Piss..How unladylike of me.At least I didnt go into detail.Like saying it burned my eyes.Oooh yeah..thats what the guys really wanna hear..all about my trip to pee.Uh.....No..Ew..No dirty old men better Email me cos of that either ewwwwwwww.

      Fuck Full House.Fuck Roseanne.Damn addictive bitch keeps me up all night.All I do is sit and wait for it to be time to watch Roseanne.And Full House.Hmm..yeah.Nick at Nite rocks my socks man.Im thinking...nothing really..I just now almost choked on a gummy bear.Could have made someones day.Someone who doesnt like me.Its not hard to think of several people who dont like me.I dont care.I just want something to do.Im trying to avoid watching tv.theres nothing on there I havent seen before.Especially Nick at Nite cos all they do is show the same shit over and over and I already watch a few hours of that..so ..I pretty much have seen whats going to be on for the next 12-18 hours.I wish I couldnt stop smiling for a little while.But I dunno..Id have to get really high or something..So..I wont do that.I have to go to work in about 4 hours or so..Yup fun stuff.Hopefully I dont have too much to do cos I just feel like a lazy ass.

      I bet its all your fault I feel like puking.I actually know so.Just the mention of your name....makes me wanna blow chunks.But..whatever.  I need a dollar...so then Ill have 40 all together...instead of just 39...I dont want quarters or nickels or dimes or pennies..just a dollar bill.and I probably wont wanna spend it.Which would be a good thing cos I havent been keeping up with my money too well ever since..hmm..ever I guess.Anyhow...Im going to go take some really icky little pill for people who cant stop puking.

      I feel like Imma puke.Yeah all day.Well at least for the past 5 to 6 hours.I dont know why but I wish it would fucking stop.My eyes are getting so extremely heavy.I think Ill go to sleep sometime soon but once I tried, and I just kept feeling chunks in my throat.SO I got up and here I am.Again.Yes.With nothing to do feeling like shit.Oh wait maybe if I smile..it will go away.Or not.I just dont know.I wish I could just go to sleep and stay asleep for a long time.Maybe not a long time but a more than 2 hours.So I guess the average 8 hours would be a pretty long time for me.Oh well fuck sleep.

      Just thinking........of you.Somewhere away from me.Thinking of someone else.Of course.  I wish I could go to sleep and dream of something super cool.Its been so long since Ive had a great dream.Here lately theyve sucked so much that I havent remembered them any.I wish I could explain in more detail.So maybe you could know too just a little at least.Things might be easier.If I could just stop thinking of everything,I wouldnt have to feel anything.Id probably be more pleasant.I keep worrying.I cant eat.I cant sleep.I cant talk to anyone else.I cant dream of anyone else. I cant think of anyone else.Early in the morning, when Im watching my fan spin or when Im driving in my car going nowhere,Im thinking of you.Even when Im thinking of someone else..I think of what you might think or what it would be like if they were you.I think of you before I sleep, hoping to see you in my dreams.When I go anywhere I look at everyone I can see, cos I think maybe Ill get to see you again.When it rains I think of sleep and I think of you.In silence, I think of your voice.I think of you knowing its not so bad.I think of you not being so negative.Thinking of you makes me feel kinda giddy.I keep thinking of you coming over.Maybe you meant to call.You probably dont have the number, right?Its ok.Im not crazy.Really.Its not normal but still...You rule my world.Youre all I think of,yet I dont know you.

      Sometimes I feel like someone is standing on my chest.Just for a second.I bet Ive already said that but...It happens way too often.To where I can actually hear myself gasp for air.Its strange.The weird thing is, I know where its coming from.Another weird thing is that if I tell anyone they will either laugh for think Im insane.So..Ill just say nothing more.Its hard to explain anyhow.Hmmmmmm....Im so bored still.Im never going to be not bored.Well except for the next time I go to someplace.I dont have any money.And when I do get money, I have to get the car that isnt mine fixed..and save the left over money for the car that is mine to be fixed. My sisters went outside..I guess to smoke.Or maybe theyre meeting someone out there.I dunno they go out there late at night way too much.Sometimes Ill go out there, and they wont even be there...and the next day Ill ask where they were and they will say "we were sitting right there"       yeah right.Hookers.

      Ok not really.I hate wearing hats.Probably cos my head is so freaking big.My car sucks.Linda should give me some of my money back so I can fix the damn thing before it explodes or something.I dunno I just really hate it so much.Its not even my car.Ive spent 40 bucks buying gas for different cars Ive driven during the week..and what sucks is that I havent driven them several times.Maybe just once to work, or once to the store...stuff of that nature..its not like I was out partying and driving other peoples cars.Oh well tho.I feel so much like shit.Too much like shit.I need a hug :(    Thats never going to happen.I should just forget that.I should go see a movie.Ive been so bored.Yeah maybe Ill do that.Actually I probably wont.But Itd be cool to think I had something to do with my Friday.Bummer.

      Today sucked so much.I went to work this morning and I got there at about hmmmm 8:23 am..I did a bunch of stuff there..then I did a bunch of other stuff later.When it was time to go home, I didnt go home cos I told someone Id stay there and work for them to be nice..so I had an hour to do nothing although I did end up doing something..It sucked.SO when I finally got to leave work, I came straight home, took a shower, and went to sleep.And now its almost 4 am and Im wide awake with nothing to do or anyone to talk to...wait Im like that almost all of the time.

      Ive decided to learn how to properly iron my clothes.Yeah..and Ive also decided that I think Im gonna go marry me some dirty pervert of and old man (cos theyre the only ones interested in me in any way) and were gonna have about 5 kids.He better make a lot of money cos I plan on being one of them stay at home moms.So Im going to spend all day cleaning stuff up or cooking and taking care of my family.I doubt Ill get lonely or depressed then cos I have come to the conclusion that there is not any person anywhere who likes me in any way.Even just other chick friends..So Ill just stay home and do that thing I do for the rest of my life until I end up shooting myself in my fucking fat ugly head.Who knows?Well actually I know.I know I suck.I know I have some kind of special ability to repell every single person I ever meet.Kinda like OFF..only its not for bugs..its specially designed for people I like.Damn that dirty pervert to hell..I think Ill just go crawl in a hole someplace and die.

      Goddamn..this is going to be the third time I attempt to do this..........but I guess its ok cos I dont got much else goin on. Ever.So I have plenty of time.I think I recently made the mistake of loaning a friend a not too small amount of money.Shes awesome tho but I dunno Im just worried something will come up and she wont be able to pay me back. Im sure itll be ok tho.Shes pretty responsible and shit like that.Oh dammit I keep coughing it totally sucks.Someday Id like to do something..I cant say its hard to explain so Im not even going to try to explain and make myself look like a fuckin idiot trying to.Hmm.Yet Ive done it anyhow.. I totally cleaned up my room today.I got rid of unnecessary things I found here and there and things that were just collecting dust.I had a rope light..a purple one..I tried to get rid of it but nobody likes it I guess.O well Ill probably end up throwing it away.

      How do you "learn" how to paint?I dont think painting is something anyone learns.I just think its one of those things you either can or cannot do.And that is it.Yeah I just saw this book and it made me think of that...so there ya go.I went to Wal Mart.Yes, Wal Mart.I got some detangler for my hair.It rules.It was a pretty quick trip..In and out.Except when we got in the car,Linda's door wouldnt shut.I guess its happened before or something cos she knew how to fix it.Kinda.Some lady stopped and helped her I had no idea how to go about getting the damn thing to stay closed anyone.Oh well.So after that I was home pretty quick.Eh.I dunno if it matters.I guess not.My throat feels all itchy.I better not get sick.Im gonna be so pissed if I do.I mean I know people get pissed about being sick but I may get violent.I went to the park today also.Nothing really exciting goin on there.So..yeah we just sat.I wonder...wonder wonder wonder......I guess.I dunno.

      Weirdo..Yes.Totally weird lookin at chicks asses and just being way too quiet.I dunno.I was so busy today.I got really far behind on things I shouldnt have gotten behind on.I think mostly cos I kept talking to people.Haha.Too much chit-chattin goin on.Ugh so now I have to go to work extra early so I can make up for the crappy job I did today.Its ok tho.I suck.On a Saturday night Im sitting here....doin nothin.Pretty much talkin to myself.Listening to my brother talk to himself.Sad.Yup.Im not sad tho just the though it saddenning is that a word?I dunno.Hmmmm....what to do?Nothing I should probably go to sleep but Im not too tired.Kinda wishing I could go ahead and go to work and get all that stuff done and then come home and go to sleep.eh probably not.I need some money.Not really I just got paid.I dont really need to spend money on everything cos I got most of the stuff I need.So.I guess I dont need money.Um yeah just forget I ever mentioned it.I wish I had something I could paint.Not like a picture but a wall or something like that maybe a chair.Painting stuff rox.I wish I could pain my room blood red.But....I cant..so..I guess I wont be doing that.My nose is all stuffy.I wish all this snot would just come out and leave me alone!Damn stuffy noses and sinus problems.Math totally rules I might screw up on it a lot but its just so fun to sit and add and divide and all that stuff..I like writing it out.I hate using a calculator unless Im in a pretty big hurry.I guess Im a nerd.I dunno..its not like I took some Honors Algebra Trig.classes or anything or ever will..I just think its fun.Aw Im so bored.Someone should come pick me up and take me far away.Yes I do have a car..but I dont wanna drive.I dont think I know anyone who would come pick me up even if it wasnt 1:15 am.So..I guess Ill just be stayin home then.Fiji water rules man.I dunno what it is about it but its just so awesome.Im trying to think think think..........and I know.........Nothing.Sometimes I feel Ive go to...........RUN AWAY..........Ive got to........GET AWAY....from the pain you driiive into the heeaarrrt of meee...the love we share seems to go nowhere and Ive lost my light for I toss and turn I cant sleep at night.        Huh?Sometimes I just wanna sing.So I did.And now its over.I dont get it...I just dont get it and I never will.I have some weird effect on people.They just totally like to ditch me.I just have some sort of appeal that makes people just wanna treat me like shit.Im forever getting ditched.All by my fucking self for no goddamn reason..if there is a reason Im sooooooooooo missing out on what it is..Id kinda like to know so that whatever the reason is, I could try to make it better.Ha..like anyone would actually tell me.Meanasses.

       For some reason this has been all screwed up.I had a bunch of stuff to say too.Dammit to hell.SO anywho..I did get to see Shadows Fall on Monday.It was alright.Bunch of little kids there.The first two bands sucked giant donkey balls.Sweaty ones.I dunno....we should have been late.I started drinking like the minute I got home from work.It was so hard to drive.I kept wanting to stop and look around at things.Had to stay focused.Which was difficult.But I managed.I rock.Not really but shit my arm itches.All of a sudden out of nowhere the damn thing is burning Im trying.Aw my friend isnt here.I have no one to talk to once again.Damn.Soooo..what else?The Pillow seems to have gone into hiding.Havent seen her for a while.Just vanished.So I have no one to make fun of either.Yup.Fat bitch.Maybe shes burning in hell.Not likely tho.Shes Catholic.Someone totally fucked up my Twisted Metal disc.I was kinda upset.But I figured if I havent seen it in that long...its my own fault.

       I think its working ok now.But so anyways I had said before..and it didnt show up..that yesterday was a pretty ok day..work actually went well and I made 25 bucks whoo hoo.And yeah other stuff and it was kinda strange but it was awesome.Today on the other hand totally sucked big donkey balls.I woke up late and so did someone else from work so we were really behind and busy and I thought I was going to lose my mind.I didnt.But then I came home and it was super hot in here and Maya was being a pest.It just really sucked.So we just took a pretty long nap and now I am bored.Shit.I hate when stuff like this happens.Ohhhhhhhhhh but its ok cos tomorrow is Monday AND Im goin to see SHADOWS FALL.Yay!Not only is it Monday but the first Monday of August yippeeee!Im still depressed tho and pissed about today and this morning and probably later and probably tomorrow morning and about Maya and my cousin and my friend and my car.Yup.Oh well what can I do
