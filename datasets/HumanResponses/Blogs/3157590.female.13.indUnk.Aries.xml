      In school right now, we are taking the 7th grade WASL. Woohoo, what fun! LOL, omg, not. Sooooo not! There are actually two sides of it. The bad side is that the WASL is a synchronized (is that the right word?)test that you are assigned to take by the government. We have two periods to take it, and it's not that exciting. Actually, it's very tedious. (Yesterday the test was really hard, because we did the first math section. I finished just on time, before the bell! We do get extra time, but you have to go to another room, and it's just weird.) The good part is that we get, like, no homework. That's actually really great, because dance rehearsals each night wears me out enough. It's not like I need some extra fatigue. Also, the second math section, which we took today, was suppppper easy. I finished in one period, and everyone was finished 30 minutes before the bell. Since we had to stay inside the classroom, we played heads up 7-up a few times, then we played telephone. Some of the nice parents drop some food and water for the laborious time that we have to take the WASL, so that's pretty cool. Today they brought us yummy cheese sticks, but i'm sure this story is getting really boring, so I will stop.  We have dance performances mostly this week, and  ALLLLLLLLLL  next week. The time varies, but we can go anywhere from 2 hours to 3 hours. The best part is hanging out with all of my friends that I don't get to see very often. The bad part is when dancing gets realllllly tiring, really boring, and really upsetting. But hey, life is tough. Deal with it! (A little advice to myself.) And I know this may sound weird, and people will ask "then, why are you taking ballet?", but I have to say it. I am not excited for the performance. I am so fatigued all of the time, and rehearsing for it is so annoying! But it will pay off.....probably. Tonight at 6:15 PM, I have Hip Hop rehearsal for an hour. Hip Hop is my favorite! My T-shirt is partially done, so so far I just have the writing on it, and the sides. It's so awesome! LOL, sorry, i'm upsessing about my shirt. Wait, sorry, obsessing. Ahhh, major brain clot there! Ok, moving on........  OMG, I am so happy! I actually think that I have a chance becoming a real writer. Ok, so, remember that assignment that I was telling you about (The historical fiction story that we had to write)? Well, we got them back today. This is what mine says: 50/40. (that means 50 out of 40. That's right, I got ten extra credit points!) Very Very Good! You have a great gift for this. Your imagination + hard work produced a great story. That's what it said. Well, except for that thing that I added in parentheses. Isn't that cool? He thinks that i'm a really good writer. And then, when I was in Study Hall for 6th period, I went to the library. Our librarian told me that she had read my story (I don't know how), and she thought that it was amazing. She was ranting on about how it was such a great story. I was so elated! I'm sorry if this sounds pathetic, but it makes me really happy when adults truly compliment me on my writing. (By the way, usually my story writing is a lot better and more laborious then my diary writing!)  OMG, time for TV talk. The O.C. is on tonight! I cannot wait to watch it! Yes. In the previews, it shows that Theresa is probably pregnant. I am so excited. Also, since Adam Brody is my super super crush, I completely understand those other girls who are in love with him as well. That said, I will let you guys know this. He is appearing on 2 shows! Well, actually, he has already appeared on one. He has appeared on Punk'd (a show on MTV where Ashton Kutcher punks his celebrity friends), and he will be appearing on Grounded For Life. It is on this Friday, at 9:00 PM, on the WB. Be sure to catch it, because you know that I wouldn't miss it! Speaking of TV, I can't wait to see the new movie  Mean Girls , that is coming out very soon in May. It looks so good! My sister and I are obsessing over it! I am also excited to see  13 Going on 30 , and some other upcoming movies that will soon hit theaters near you. Haha, I sound like one of those commentary guys that's talking while they're playing trailers on TV.   Ok, well, I should probably go. I have to edit my website, get dressed for dance, and make a snack for it. Even though that will be pointless, because we will never have a break. But anyway, ciao! See ya on the flip side. OMG, I don't even know what that means. Please let me know. Arrivaderchi!   Much Love,           ~Sophs~:)

      Oh, my, god. I am sooooooooo truly glad that it is Saturday! I would have written a little more this week, but I was amazingly busy with school, ballet, Hip Hop, and other things in my life. Yes, that's right, I have a life. LOL, at least I think I do. No, I do. Anyway, I had so much going on this week, I need to record everything!   I had so much homework. Especially this one big project. The assignment was to write a story however many pages you want, about a person your age, in whatever previous time period you wanted. It was exciting, because there were no guidelines. I chose World War II, because that's the most interesting time period, in my opinion. Partly because Anne Frank was in it, and I really like her. (She kept a diary while she was in hiding with her family from the Germans, for those of you who don't know who she is). Anyway, my story ended up to be exactly 13 pages. I think it turned out pretty good, if you ask me. It is called Hope In My Heart. I will tell you what I got on it, after I get it back from the teacher. (We have the WASL test next week, so that gives me two advantages. Firstly, I will have less homework, so I can write in here more, and secondly, he can correct all of our stories. Well, actually, that's an advantage to him, but oh well). I also had tests to study for, and I had to make a T-shirt for Hip Hop (I'll explain later).   OK, I was having an AIM conversation about 15 minutes ago with one of my friends, and I decided to be different. Whenever IMing, people always ask the same question. "What's up?" or "How are you?" or something else related to that. So instead of explaining all of my news from Friday to now, I will paste in what I told her. (Everyone says in response to what's up, "nothing." Well, that's physically and mentally impossible, and so I decided to actually tell her what was up with my life. LOL, so here's the full blown news:  So I went to school, which was very boring. ( Very boring ). Then I went to Hip Hop from 3-5 o'clock. That was really fun. Our teacher brang her new (since 4 days) little puppy that's half rotweiler. He was so cute! His name is.....ummmm.....ahhh! Oh yeah, it is Tyson. He kept running loose, and winding his way through us dancing. LOL, cutie. I got to walk him outside. Anyway, then, right after that, I met Alyssa at thriftway, and we sold tickets to La Sylphide (the upcoming blue heron ballet) for an hour. No one wanted tickets. It was fun and boring. Everyone was like "no thanks" or "no." boring. Then I got home, was bored for an hour, watched my Friday TV shows for 2 hours, and then I watched the movie that I rented called Camp. Then I went to bed. Today, this morning, I had to get up at 9:30, so I could go to group harp (which is on most Saturdays). It's where me, Mia, Megan, and our teacher (all harpists) meet, and play songs. Great fun! Not. So not. It's not fun getting up way too early for Saturdays. Then after that, my parents picked me up, and we went to check the mail. My dad and I got our package from Amazon. It was the 2 books that we ordered a week earlier. My book was  Princess in Pink  (part of the princess diaries series). Then I got home, and then went to the little house to pick grace up, and got chocolate. Then I got home, was bored, and then went back to the little house to buy a cute diary (that has a side lock) that I had eyed earlier. Then I got back home, and got online. That brings me to right now, typing this.  There! Nothing much else happened this week except for lengthy dance classes, and everything. Oh, yeah. In Hip Hop, our teacher (Barbara (she's soooo great)) told us that she wants us to come up with a name for ourselves, and she wants us to actually get kinds of gigs that are not before the ballet performances. (Which we usually dance at). One of the girls in my class has a band name suggestion. It was this: Totally Knocked Out (TKO). Isn't it cool? I really like it. Tell me what you think, to the people who are reading this. Also, tell me your suggestions. Thanks! Well, I better get back to editing my website. By the way, if you didn't get to this blog from my personal website (Twisted*Starburst), then please visit it, and bookmark it!!! The link is:  urlLink   Please go there! Thanks. (It helps cure boredom). Ok, well, CIAO FOR NOW! I love you all.  Much Love,         *Sophs*

       Sat Apr 17, 07:42:30 PM  .  (This is the actual date).   Sometimes I wonder about people. No, not just people. People’s emotions. Sometimes they are hard to forget. Sometimes they are hard to let go of. I mean, does an average person really understand another person so well, that they are compatible? Or do they just think that they understand the other person? Most people…they just look into the eyes of others, not really knowing them. Not knowing who they are exactly. Not knowing how they feel exactly. Sure, some people have to find their selves. But really, they’re finding their soul. They’re finding who their soul is. To actually accomplish such a thing requires bravery. It requires believing in you. What matters most is what you think of yourself. People take a glance at others, not really knowing. Not knowing one thing. They don’t know what’s on the inside of the person. What’s in their soul. This may be hard to hear for some people, but only one person can look inside their soul and really…really feel and know who and what they are as a person. No one else can cure a person. Only one person can cure their selves. Only one person can be their self. The fact is this…life is like movies in some ways. In movies, people think that the ending is the most important part. They think that when the ending is happy, and everything else is tough, that the movie was not depressing. The truth is this…the journey is the most important part of a movie. Sure, the ending is what wraps it all up, and it’s important. But the journey is what gets you to the ending. It’s the progress along the way to your dream. It is always tough. It makes you want to give up. But you just have to keep trying. This is the same in real life. The journey is how you find yourself. It’s a deep look inside your soul. The ending is when you’ve found yourself. Most people don’t think or know that the journey is the most important part.   I can't write for long, because my sister wants to use the computer to print out a prom dress. (That's right, it's that time again). Anyway, I watched White Oleander earlier today (I know, I know, I watch a lot of TV), and it was really sad. (That's what inspired me to write what I wrote above). It's a really powerful movie. I really like Alison Lohman. She's such a good actor. But it's weird that she's 21 years old! I mean, she looks so much younger. (Yeah, I shouldn't be talking either, but oh well). Anyway, I need to figure out some way to get these posts published. I'm having some trouble. Ciao for now!   Love ya,  MUAH (I don't know how to spell it, but it's French for me! lol.)

       April 15th, 2004   April 8th was my birthday. It was great! I got the DVD Freaky Friday, two Chicken Soup for the Soul books, some candy, a Mustek digital camera (4000) (!), and some other stuff. Isn't that great? The cam is totally awesome! I love it. I love experimenting. It can not only take digital pictures, but it can also record videos, store MP3's, and record voice messages. It's so fun, because I can record myself being other people. Haha, it's great. You have no idea.           I am watching Friends right now. It's not a new one, but the one prior to this one was new. It's such a shame that Friends is ending. This is the last season. At least I have a Friends trivia board game that I bought recently. It has like, a billion questions that are actually really hard. Usually. Anyway...         Yay, the 5th Gossip Girl book is coming out soon! Score...I can't wait. Hummm.....god, I wish that I knew who Gossip Girl really was. I mean, which character she is. If she is even a character, for that matter.  You know you love me.  Gossip Girl

       April 7th, 2004 (the real date).   I am Gossip Girl. That's me. Yes, i'm a real person, and no, my birth name is not Gossip Girl. But have you ever read the book series  Gossip Girl ? If you haven't, you should really give it a try. If you like fashion, gossip, popularity, and great books, then this is probably a great book for you. It's about these teens living on the "Upper East Side" of New York, living their life, one day at a time. It's that kind of book that sucks you into the fabulous, glamorous story.&nbsp;The 5th one's coming out on May 5th! I am so excited! But enough about that book, lets talk about me! OMG, The O.C. is the best show  ever!  It's on tonight, and I can hardly contain myself! I am in love with Seth Cohen. He is so attractive, hilariously funny, and SUCH a good actor! I mean, c'mon, who couldn't love him? I heard that they were taking a character off the show (as in dying) at the end of the season, and I keep on wondering which character it will be. Ryan? Marissa? Kirsten? Seth? (God, no!) Luke? Sandy? Jimmy? Julie? Summer? I love  The Princess Diaries  book series! Mia is, like, my favorite book character ever! And Meg Cabot is a fabulous, glamorous, glitzy author!!! I can't wait to read her 5th book,  Princess In Pink ! CIAO FOR NOW!   You know you love me, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gossip Girl

      Hey! Now I have a diary of my own, but it's online! I'm very excited. Yes, I keep a diary on paper, but I think it's finally time to have an actual blog that I stay with for more than a month! I have tried other hosts, so I hope that this one works how I want it to. I tried to put my blog on blogger, and have it on my personal website, but it just would NOT work! Ahhhhh...it made me really upset. :( It is really frustarating, because I want to put it on my website, but the stupid thing wouldn't work! I hope this works okay. Humdedum...  So you want to know what i'm doing right now? Currently? Right this very second? Well, if you want to know so bad...I am watching  One Tree Hill . It's a show with Chad Michael Murray. He's such a hotty! And he's really romantic and sensitive. I love him. And I really like the show. Just so you know, I kind of watch a lot of TV. Yeah, do you want to know all of the shows that I just wouldn't miss each week? Ok, you asked for it! Here's the list:  *7th Heaven *Everwood *Gilmore Girls *One Tree Hill *THE O.C .(omg, such a good show!) *Friends (ohhh...it's coming to an end.) *Reba  *What I Like About You *Grounded for Life   And here are some of the shows that I like, but don't care if I miss:  *Ally Mcbeal *As Told by Ginger *Real World *American Idol   Wow, that's all that I can think of right now. Sad. Anyway, I  do  watch a lot of TV. Maybe even too much (ok, definately), but that's ok. Lets start with some basics about me:  I am 13 years old (as of about 2 weeks ago), and I live on a small island close to Seattle, Washington. I love to write, read, draw, watch TV (lol, surprise!), get online, talk to my friends, blog, read, read, and read. Oh yeah, I also love gossip. (Guilty.) My favorite color is blue, my favorite foods are spaghetti, nachos, and a LOT of fruit. If you ask me what my favorite book is, I won't be able to say, because I don't have one. For me, it's not possible. Actually, it's not that I never have one, but it always changes. Right after I read a book, I usually think that that's my newest favorite book, because it's fresh. But honestly and overall, no favorite book. And it's the same thing with movies. I have one sister who is 16. I am actually glad that I have a sister. I love my sister. Yes, we fight like normal siblings, but sometimes we can be really good friends and talk about things. That's about all. Anyone who reads this will probably learn more about me as I start writing more entries. Humdedum...  I really do not want to go to school tomorrow. Honestly, I really hate school. I really do. It's sooooo stressful, and it's not fun sitting in tight rooms listening to lectures for, 6 hours. Is there anyone who actually does  like  school? Because I don't know anyone who does. Well, I do, but they don't love school. I hate getting up super early, but I guess that's life. And if Meg Cabot (a famous author) went through school, then I can survive through it as well. (Well, at least that's what she said in her blog. To read the coolest blog ever, go to  urlLink    I should probably get going. It's almost 10:00 PM, so I have to go to bed soon, once  One Tree Hill  is over. (Which is at 10:03 PM). Well, hopefully I will write again very soon. Ciao!!!  Love ya, ME

      I am sitting on my bed for two reasons. Firstly, I was sitting on the couch, because there was an evil spider on my computer table in the living room. That’s right, evil. I hate all spiders. It may be a crime to hate those innocent creatures, but I for one would rather die than have spiders crawling all over every speck of my body. Well, maybe not die, but you get what I’m saying. Right?   Anyway, once I moved to the couch, my dad came in from working outside, and he turned on the TV. That’s right, the TV. The tube. The boob tube. The good for nothing, no good, tedious TV. Normally, I love TV. I have many weekly shows that I find very amusing, engrossing, and not tedious. However, I have watched soooooo much TV in the past few days, I don’t know if I can utterly stand it anymore! As you know, it’s Spring Break, and whenever I’m bored, I usually turn on the TV, because there is absolutely nothing else to do. Well, at least in my mind there is nothing else to do. Anyway, I got sick and tired of listening to the TV, and so I moved my business into the bedroom. Business, as in homework. That’s right, I was doing my homework. And why aren’t I doing it now, you ask? Because I got bored of it, and I thought that this would be more interesting. I also got writers block from it. Not a good sign. That means that there is something wrong with the story. (That’s what I read online at a website). My assignment should be very fun. And it is pretty fun at some parts, but right now I am lost. And whenever I am lost, I usually just set it aside and wait for ideas. Even though I am really bad with coming up with ideas. Authors continually say that ideas just pop into their head, but it’s a different story for me! Usually. Anyway, my assignment is for my Humantities class, and we’re supposed to write a historical fiction short story that took place in any historical time period. I chose WWII, since I know a lot about the Holocaust. Well, I gotta go eat something.   Ok, i'm back. Oh my god, I really do not want Spring Break to end. Yep, and it's already late Friday night. If there were smily face options on this thing, I would paste in a sad face. But there's not, so i'll just have to say that school really sucks. Yeah, sometimes it's worthwhile. But most of the time, I long for the time that I can spend at home.   If you didn't know this about me, i'm telling you right now. I have always (and still want to, by the way) wanted to publish a book. I don't mean small fame, and self-publishing. I mean I want to be famous. I have always loved writing. Writing is my passion. Just like Meg Cabot's passion is writing. I want to be an author just like her. After all, she DOES write one of my absolute FAVORITE book series (The Princess Diaries Series). Ok, well, I have to get offline soon. Why, you ask? Because my parents are going to watch a movie. Ok, I seriously need to get off now. Ciao for now!!!   Love you all,  ME

      HeLlO!!! I am at school right now (in Computers class). I'm not sure if I am allowed to do this, but it's not like i'm checking my email or anything. So anyway, ahhhhhh. LOL. My friend (Callie) is reading my diary page right now (this one). I hope you like it, Callie! Anyway.....  I really cannot talk long, because for some reason, I am afraid that I will be cought (I don't know, i'm just always so paranoid! LOL.)   Yesterday I thought that I lost my Pointe shoes, because I didn't have them. So I had to go all the way back to my dance (ballet)class, and see if they were there. Well, they weren't. I was really upset. So then I went all the way back home. Then my sister said that someone had left a message. It turned out that it was Caroline, saying that she had gone back up, and saw my Pointes. I was so grateful! Hehehehe. She said that she took them, and now she is giving them back to me today, at break (which is right after this class).  Uh oh, the class is ending in five minutes. Ciao! Oh, by the way, I am trying to learn Dutch. It's exciting!  CIAO CHUMS! (I know chums is in England, but oh well.)  Love you all, Sophs

          I just finished the book  Princess In Pink . Oh my god, it was sooooooooooooo good! I can't help but beaming when I reach the near end. I feel like I  am  Mia. Therefore, I get really elated when great things happen to her. But then, afterwards, I feel jealous, because my life is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO not as good as Mia's! It's not fair. Well, I guess it is. Wait, no it's not!!! Ahhhhh.......seriouisly, though. The great things that happen to her (by the way, if you have not read this book, are not at the end yet, or plan to read this book, then don't read the following, because it's a "spoiler alert"!): BEGINNING OF SPOILER ALERT!!! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Mia gets to go to the prom with her one true love of her life!!! (The hunk, Michael). *Mia gets to have her prom on the Empire State Building, just because her grandmother has "connections"!!! *Mia has a little brother! (Although I REALLLLLLLLLLY did wish that it was a girl.) *She "may" have gotten to second base, but she doesn't know. (LOL!) *She's a princess, afterall. Yes, this is definately not the best thing in the world, because it's stressful and hard, but she sure has quite an interesting life. She always has something unbelievable going on to write about. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * END OF SPOILER ALERT!!!  Sorry if I kind of copied Meg Cabot on that one. I have to give her props on her teen personality, amazing books, and awesome blog!!! I haven'st read all of her books....yet.   Well, on Tuesday, Zelda and I were chatting online. She said that she did something TERRIBLE, and that I would be really super mad at her. I begged her to tell me, but she said that she wouldn't, that her crush is really mad at her, and that it had nothing to do with me. It was weird though, because she said that I would not be her best friend anymore. On Wednesday, she was late to school, because she felt really sick, but she told me in the last class of the day, 6th period, Study Hall. I can't post it in here, because that would be gabbing to someone (everyone and anyone who reads this), but I was disappointed in her. She promised that she would never do it again. Her and her crush worked it out, they both like each other, even though they're not going out, so it's all good.   Performances are over!!!!!!!!!!! Yes I am happy, but also quite sad. It was sad hanging out with all of my dear friends, but happy leaving all of the stress and jet lag behind. Actually, the jet lag has not been left behind. I still have these moments during the day where I all of a sudden get really exhausted. I mean, on Monday I fell asleep on the couch for two hours, and woke up at seven o'clock. It was really weird. A weird feeling. I can't really explain it. I usually wake up really early, when it's dark, and i'm tired. But this time I woke up before that, and before bed. Weird. On Tuesday, we had our cast party with all of the dancers (well, a lot of them), and our dance teacher awarded the last apple award (for Sunday). I got it! Cool, huh? Even though I got it a year ago for Cinderella, but she couldn't remember. An apple award is a thing that we dancers get awarded for each performance. For every performance night, an apple is given out to the best dancer as an actor and expressor onstage. This includes smiling, looking out, acting their best, and being someone else. I love getting things like that where I am honored. But then again, who doesn't?! I felt so happy. Automatically, when she said that at first I didn't want to perform (which was a long time ago), I knew it was me. Because she ALWAYS has to mention that detail. LOL, she's a really great teacher.  I am so sad. All of this week (mostly last week) there were season finales of alllllll the best shows! And for  F.R.I.E.N.D.S , there was a series finale. Tear! It was so good though. I loved the end, where everything was happy. (Besides the whole Monica and Chandler moving away thing.) That was funny when they didn't know that Erica was having twins! LOL. I am going to miss a lot of my favorite shows over the summer, though. Like, for instance, Everwood, Gilmore Girls (actually, next week is the season finale of that), One Tree Hill, Grounded For Life, What I Like About You, and don't let me forget THE O.C.!!! The best show ever. As the end came nearer, I was actually about to cry! I mean, Seth is going on his boat to Tiwauna (or however you say it). At least I think he is. That's what one of my friends said. And Ryan is leaving with what's-her-name, because she is pregnant! I mean, what is all of that about????? Normally, I do not like Ryan. However, the show could not be the same without him! Personally, I think that Theresa (oh, THAT'S HER NAME!) is going to get a miscarriage, and he will come back to Orange County. OMG, did you see Julie's mansion? That was actually amazing. Julie and Caleb......ewwwwwww. I feel so bad for Marissa! She's getting ripped off. Bribed.   Ok, well, I better go. My mom has to call her mom, or something like that. Ciao my dear fan readers!!!!!!! I love you all, especially the ones that love me. Ok, arrivaderchi.  Love,  ~Sophs~  P.s. I finally wrote Belen back! Yay! I can't wait until I get a response. I will keep you fully updated.

      We are finally done with the WASL, I just thought that you should know. (Sorry if this blog is totally boring, but I just write what I know. And isn't that what everyone tells you?) Anyway, we had a celebration thing with cupcakes and apple juice. Yeeeck. At least we're done, though.   Ahhh...I have a Science test today. Could this get any worse?...  Umm...apparently, yes, it could! Dance rehearsals are actually getting amazingly tedious and LOOOOOOONG. I know that we need the practice, but some people hardly ever get to do their dance, and yet they have to come for the whole thing. I don't think that that's fair to them. :( At least the performance will be over soon enough. Plus, it's less than an hour, which is very short. In Hip Hop, our teacher told us to make up a rhyme, so Danielle and I found one, and used it. (When we are on the stairs, we say it). It went like this: I should worry, I should care I should marry a millionare He should die, I should cry Then i'd marry a richer guy! And now we can't do it, because the dance director thought that it was too "inapropriate." She said that she had a bad feeling about it. And our teacher wasn't there that day, so we got her in trouble! That's really annoying. I mean, we didn't mean to do that! She could have gotten mad at us (even though the rhyme was totally ok). Plus, it was from a little kids rhyme book (in the jump rope section). Well, that sucks, but oh well. I guess it was like offensive or something? Whatever.  I have to go soon, because we have to leave for school, and I usually don't write in here before school because i'm doing something else, or i'm too tired. LOL. But I did today. I love this blog! It's so awesome! This is like a record for how many entries I have written in one service.  BLOGGER ROX!!!!!! Meg Cabot, when are you going to come to Seattle again?.......still waiting. LOL.  Ok, well, ciao chums. Arrivaderchi!   Ti amo tutti! (Italian), Sophs

      I can't believe that I have to go back to school tomorrow! Ahhhhh. I hate school. It actually sucks badly. I wish it was a lot more fun, and I wish that we didn't have to wake up so frickin early! Besides, I can never ever get to sleep on Sunday nights. The past two Sunday nights went by very slowly, because I could not get to sleep the entire night. And I am not even kidding you. I mean I lay in bed exhausted, but not being able to actually get some shut eye. It was so irritating! So I hope that this Sunday is different. I'll let you know. School is a nightmare come true. Well, it's not THAT bad, because it's not scary, but it is so un-fun. I'm being honest, and saying that school officially sux! Most of the time. LOL.  This Saturday (yesterday) was the first day of my mom's open studio. (She is in the art tour on the island.) My dad just finished remodeling the front section of our garage and turned it into a beautiful studio where mom hung her artwork. If you don't know what the Art Tour is, then I will tell you. It happens twice a year, where artists from all over the island hang up their new artwork in their studio, or another place. It is published in the newspaper, and a lot of other places on the island. Everyone knows about it. Then people just go visit all of these art galleries, and buy different kinds of artwork if they are interested. Anyway, i've just been, like, sitting out there. People come in, and they look around. I actually think that her artwork is pretty cute. Most of the time. She's earned a fair amount of money so far as a first-timer. It also happened today, and will happen next Saturday, and then Sunday. There is only four days of the art tour twice every year.  Our dance performance (La Sylpheid) is on this coming Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Everybody should come! I will be in ballet and hip hop. It will be fun. I just don't like the time consuming, tedious rehearsals each night. But I do like seeing my friends. Some of them I don't get to see that often.   My dad went to Chicago today, and he's coming back Friday night. :( He's going to visit his parents. I have not seen them forever.   Oh my god, you will never guess who I got a letter from about a week ago. Ok, so there's this thing that I participate in each Winter called Operation Christmas Child. Actually, my mom kind of runs it. She collects shoeboxes on the island from islanders who care enough to pack shoeboxes. This operation runs through the United States. It is where you can pack a shoebox (or more than one) with basic items like a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, soap, candy, notebooks, pens, pencils, etc. Then you drop them (or it) off at your local drop off location, and they send them to different poor countries of poverty. You can include a letter, and if you're lucky, then they could write you back if they know English, or can get a translator. Anyway, I got this letter dated April 2nd. It was sent by airmail, and when I opened it, I was amazed! It was from a girl named Belen V. Doctor. She will be 13 years old in October, and she lives in the Philippines. She said that she got my shoebox, and she is VERY grateful. She also wished me a very happy birthday. She was so sweet. She said that she is the youngest of two sisters and a brother, and she wants to be my friend!!! Best of all, she sent a mini photo of her! She is really cute. I cannot wait to write her back! I just don't really know what she does and doesn't know. But still, it will be awesome to have a real penpal.   Ok, well, I should go. It's after 9:00, and I kinda want to get some sleep, or get ready for bed, or just read. Who knows. Ok, ciao for now!  Much Love, ~Sophs~

      Wow, I hate this thing! I was typing this long thing in Blogger, and I just lost it! Ackkkkkkkkkkkikkkkkkkkkk. This sux. I hate losing writing things. Oh well. I guess that I will just have to start ALL OVER AGAIN! Ok, calm yourself Sophs.   Anyway.............  Guess where I am righ now? No seriously, guess! Ok, i'll tell you. I am at................................................. .......................................................................................................................... .................................................................. .......................................................................................................................... ...................................................................................................................... ....................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................ ........................................................................................................................ ...................................................................CORNISH! Ok, maybe it's not as exciting to you, but who  cares. Not me, obviously. LOL. I am in the waiting room at the NEW and improved building, Cornish. Yes, they build a new one.  It is different, and not as hallwayish as the last one, but it's okay. I mean, I think that I like the other one better, but  this one is still cool. ESPECIALLY because they have two computers in the waiting room or hang out place. They are pretty new,  and flatscreens. :) They're so cool. Molly, Chelsea, and Amanda are with me. Julia is in Ballet 3/4 right now, but Chelsea, Molly,  and me take ballet 5 at 10:30 (a.m.), so we are chatting on AIM buddy express and hangin' out and stuff. Amanda takes Ballet 7 (!)  about the same time as us, but she REALLLLy doesn't want to do it. She wants to be in our class. Which I totally agree with by the way.  I mean, it seems so hard! Ackkk. LOL. ROFL. (Rolling on floor laughing.) Sorry Amanda:(, if you're reading this. Hummmmmmm.....de....dummmm..... Cornish is fun so far, but that's because we haven't started taking classes. LOL! Anyway, hummmm. This is fun. I love hanging out at Cornish here. I haven't seen these people in veryyyy long. LOL. I refer to them as people. :)   Well, since it is Cornish, it is OBVIOUSLY Summer now! Yes, school is out! We got out on Monday. It was a half day, where we all signed out yearbooks. The yearbooks were ok, but they were really thin. And parts of it were really lame and pointless (I think, anyway). Danielle came over yesterday. (After I got my haircut about 3 inches. I guess it's okay.) Anyway, we had fun. We jumped through the sprinkler, put it under the trampoline, and ate yummy foods. Ahhhh....summer. I love summer. But then again, who doesn't? Seriously, do you know ANYONE who dislikes summer? Well, of course not, because it is the greatest!   Well, I'm going to go now, cuz I have pretty much nothing else to say, no new news, and I want to surf the web before I have my first Cornish class in exactly 25 minutes. :)  CIAO! I LOVE YOU ALL!    Much love, *Sophs*

      Oh my god, I am so sorry for not writing for more than a week!!! I really have, like, a goal to write more than once a week. Honestly. I want to write at least.....three days a week in this blog.   My website kinda sux. Ya know why? Because no one goes there! Only 80 something people have been there. I know, maybe it's selfish, but I want business! LOL. I want the forum to get started and be a comfy, chatty place. I want guestbook opinions. I want people to read this! Ok, sorry, but I just really needed to get that out and said. I just want people to come here and have fun. I know it's not a domain name, and that kind of ruins a lot of the popularity, but still. I hope gradually, more people are getting in the know. Just tell all of your friends, and just anyone you know! Thanks.   Right now I am sittin on the couch, typing, and watching the MTV Movie Awards!!! I love it! This is the greatest award show. Well, pretty much. It's funny. I think it's cool that Lindsay Lohan is hosting the awards. I hate how everyone is like "Oh...my...god! Lindsay Lohan? She is such a bitch! Why doesn't she lose some weight?" It makes me so furious! No, of course i'm not one of those suck up, "oh Lindsay, you are my hero!!!" type girls, but I don't have anything against her. I mean, she  is  a good actress, and there's nothing wrong with her. People just like to gossip and talk bad about other people, because they have absolutely nothing better to do. The next time you say you hate someone, think about why that is. Think about what they have done to someone else or yourself. It is hard for me as well, but my sister gave me that advice a long time ago, and it's a really good rule to follow. OMG, I sound like a mother! Ahhh! Ok, i'm going to stop now. But still, the MTV awards! Yay! Aren't you guys happy? I wish I was there. That'd be so cool. It would be much, much cooler than sitting on this lame couch in my tiny house. I hope there are many surprises along the way! I think Paris Hilton and Christina Aguilera actually look pretty and/or cute! But Eminem? God, no! Ewwwww. He is so sick. I hate him. (No offense to all of you Em lovers out there, just an opinioon.) I just think that he's really retarded, has bad messages (in his songs), and screwed up his life. I don't know, I guess that he's okay some of the time.  I am so jealous of the Harbor School here!!! They get out today.  TODAY!!!  I am sorry, but that is just way too unfair. Guess when we, us public middle schoolers, get out? The Monday after next. Yep, that's right. We have one week to go, and then a Monday. Why, you ask, do we end on a Monday? Well, we got almost a whole week off in the Winter, because it actually snowed! So we had snow days! Oh, and then the power went out. But anyway, we have to make up school for that. The government requires a certain number of days of school, so we absolutely  have  to end on a stupid Monday. I am really unhappy about that. A lot of people aren't going to come on that half-day, Monday, because some are leaving on Summer trips, and some just don't care.  Well, the staff knows that, so that's why they are not going to let anyone get their yearbooks earlier than that. No exceptions. Seriously. We have to wait until Monday to get our yearbook. I hate that. And I start Cornish, the dance college, that day! I'm not actually going to college, but i'm taking classes there. I'm sure that I already told you about this, but I can't even remember! LOL! Anyway, I am going to miss my first day of Cornish, but that's only because I want my yearbook, and signed!  Hahahaha, Carmen Electra kissed Snoop Dog AND Paris Hilton. LOL.  Anyway, I will talk about Cornish now. I am going over with Julia and Danielle (yes, it is final), and then our dance teacher will pick us up. (Christine, the one who teaches here, as well as at Cornish.) Anyway, I am taking Ballet 5, Intro to Pointe, and Jazz. This is the first year I am taking Ballet 5. It is for 13 years old and up. I basically just turned 13, so that is kinda scary, but I instantly heaved a sigh of relief, because Amallia (Christine's daughter) will be in that class. I met her last year. She's really nice. Molly and Chelsea are also taking that class. And then I have Intro to Pointe when I am supposed to have my lunch break. It is for an hour, and I can't stand to wear my Pointe shoes for an hour. I start hurting after, like, 10 minutes! But oh well, my friends will be in the classes. And then I will eat a very fast lunch and get to Jazz a little late. I hope Jazz is fun. Last year it was. The only reason I say that is because it's for 9-12 year olds. Now, I know that would rule me out, but last year it seemed like it was for about my age. I don't know, 9 year olds aren't very good at it. They just can't do it. :( It's sad. Hehehehe, both kinds of sad, by the way. LOL. Oh, by the way, when I first get to Cornish, I will have about an hour and a half of a break until Ballet 5 starts. That means that I get to do anything! The best part is that there is a computer up the huge metal staircase enclosed in this big room. It is at the top of the stairs, and barely anyone goes up there. Except for those two girls last year who were really rude and were like "oh my god, you guys know about AIM? Aren't you, like, 9?" Well, they are just stupid. We were on AIM chatting. It was great! Anyway, I can probably write and update my diary while i'm there. It will be wonderful fun. I am so excited!   Ok, well, I SERIOUSLY have to go right now. It is almost 10:00 PM! But tomorrow's Friday, so, yeah. Ok, well, ciao my fans! JK. Love you!    MUCH LOVE, *Sophs*

      Hey all of you readers (hah, aka, Amanda)!!! Here is an unfinished&nbsp;story that I wrote at Cornish that I couldn't save on a disk (the floppy drive was crapped up and wouldn't work), couldn't put on my website (couldn't access my account), so have no choice to save it on here. Since I want to finish it and everything, I can always go here and get the beginning, rather go to Cornish again this summer. Haha, which is impossible. Anyway, here it is! Tell me how you like it... &nbsp; Name: Madison  Guy: Julian  Pet: keiko&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Tuesday, June 10th, On my bed, 11:30 a.m.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, I have decided to start a record of my life. I am starting a diary! This is my very first one, so you can see how I am vastly excited and anxious! The idea came to me as I was standing in one of my local bookstores. It’s huge, and so far it’s my favorite place in this small town. I was standing in the far corner, at the edge of the teen book section. The book Miss Smithers was in my hand, and my head was engrossed into the tenth page. I had already read the first one in the series, and now, reading the sequel for the first time, I had the most dazzling, spectacular, and astounding idea yet. I couldn’t believe that I had been reading teen fiction diaries for as long as I can remember, and never thought about actually starting one. I guess that I secretly always thought that if I started one, it wouldn’t be as funny or enchanting. But now that I have, it makes me feel ecstatic! You see, when I read great books, inspiration hits me like a bolt of lightening in a thunderstorm!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now that I have started my actual, first diary, I will begin with an introduction to my life. You see, my life is very simple. It’s very simple, but it’s also very complex. I will begin with myself. My name is Madison Malone. I have lived in upstate New York for all of my life, which would now be for 13 years. I have been an official teenager since May 7th. Living in upstate New York all of my life has taught me many, many lessons. For one, I have learned to be a more independent young teen, since you have to walk absolutely EVERYWHERE here, where I live. Of course, there are taxis, subways, private cars or walking. Walking is your last resort, but somehow I find it comforting and refreshing. Plus, I never have enough fare money for a taxi (what my parents call, unsafe), and the subway creeps me out. Ok, now you’re thinking, now why would she think that taxis are expensive? The only reason my parents think that taxis are dangerous, is because something realllllllly creepy happened to my mother when she was going to her sister’s house a year ago. Alright, let me explain………  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a foggy morning on a Sunday, and my mom was going to visit her sister (my religious aunt). The next day was school for me, so the plan was to come home in the early evening. My mom left in a taxi (which was when she thought that they were perfectly fine), and everything was fine. She went to my aunt’s house, drank some green tea, whatever, and then hailed a cab. The driver was a male Mexican. He had short black, greasy, slicked back hair, and professional taxi clothes. He was your average man. He wore a white tee, striped black tie, gray pants, and black slacks. (By the way, I know this because I saw him later in the arms of the two cops.) Anyway, while she was riding in the taxi, the man kept staring back at her in his rearview mirror up front. My mom was totally creeped out by him… &nbsp; Ok, that's all I have so far. Gotta go. Ciao!  &nbsp; &nbsp; Much Love, **Sophsalophs**

      Heyyyyya! I'm currently at Cornish, sitting in the hanogout place with all of the computers. Julia (my friend, and also fellow dancer:) is making a blogger account as I type.   Oh my god! The  WEIRDEST  thing happened to me today! Ok, so, Julia and I were on the ferry (the Sealth ferry, if you are a detailed person), and she was talking, telling me  something.  Anyway, I was thinking the most randomest thoughts. So in my head, I was like, whoa, that would be pretty cool if Mr. Kirk was on the ferry, because we aren't going to see him that much, since he is retiring from his position as principal for my middle school.   Anyway, I imagined him walking by and saying hi (I know, i'm crazy, but I have a verrry random mind)! Anyway, THEN, the WEIRDEST thing happened. (Oh, by the way, I did not tell Julia about my thought, cuz it was just a thought.) So then I hear a voice, I turn around, and it's MR. KIRK!!! OMG, I started COMPLETELY freaking out!   I was going to tell him about the weird thought, but then I decided not to, cuz then I would sound like a goofball. lol. But it was just really weird. So I told Julia about the whole thing afterwards, walking up the dock, and she was like, why didn't you tell me this before? I dunno, it was just a very weird moment. :) Don't laugh!  Hummm...anyway, OMG! I almost forgot to tell you! Ok, I have published my first zine! Ok, maybe not  published,  but I have created Issue 1! Meaning, I have copied all 25 copies of my zine, and they are awesome! Kinda. ANYWAYYYY...you don't know what a zine is? OMG! Well, it is a mini magazine (but don't call it a magazine, like some people, cuz it's not!) that is written by an infamous, normal person. Not a big publisher and crew, like Seventeen, but like a city person who makes a zine and drops it off at the local Tower Records.  Yeah, they actually do that. So now that you know what a zine is, I can say that I made one! Sure, it doesn't look or sound so impressive (because it's only about 10 pages, and on paper), but it took a lot of work! I had to write all of the articles, then type them up, print them out, and paste the typed up articles onto the sample booklet (not stapled together), and then go to the copy store. From there, I had to copy 25 sheets of each page (there are 3 WHOLE pages in all), after learning how to put the paper in the write way, and THENNNNN I had to fold all of the pages in half, and then put them together, and then FINALLY staple them! (After we had xeroxed all of the papers, we learned that there was a machine that could actually have folded all of them and stapled them! But it would cost more money. So we ended up staying there for, like 45 minutes, folding and stapling the damn zine! LOL, sorry. I like my zine, but i'm just saying that it took a lot of work. Surprisingly.)   SOOOO.....if you want a zine (which, i'm sure you do, cuz they are special. lol), you can ask me, and I will surely give you one. For now, they are free, but if they are popular (haha, right), then maybe I will charge, cuz it cost money to make them. But anyway, please ask me, because they are awesome. And I hope you agree. By the way, the name of my zine is TWISTED. :)  K, well, I gotta go. Partly because I am tired of typing on this reallllly stiff keyboard (!), and also because I want to do something else.  I will type again from good ol' Cornish!  Ciao fellow fan chums!  Love,  Sophie (AKA Sophs, Soph, Sudzy Sophs, Sophsalophs, etc...)

       I know that I haven't written for a while, and I am truly sorry about that. I am trying to write more thoroughly, because I really like doing this. Anyway, I am at Cornish right now. Ballet (5) starts in about an hour. Humdedum.................  Oh my god. Something terrible has happened on the island that I live on. There was a car accident! I was actually so sad, because my dad and I drived down bank road to see where an accident could have been. And we saw it. We saw a hugely bent telephone pole that only a car could have hit. So then my dad got on a Seattle news website, and looked up an article. It said that one seventeen year old (who was killed), and three 16 year olds (who were badly injured and our now in the hospital in Seattle) were in the car.   Later, Danielle called me, and we talked about it. I found out who was in the car, but i'm not gonna post it online. It will most definately be in the local newspaper. The worst thing was that they weren't even drinking (or on drugs). They just missed a turn, and then the car turned on it's side, and started rolling. Another car (with a 23-year old, don't know the name) was in another car, trying to avoid the teenage car. So it swerved out of the way, but then the 23-year old hit the telephone pole. It is so terrible. I get so shocked that something like this could happen AGAIN on our tiny little island.   Not that I don't know that there is so much crime out there. But lately, our island is getting more and more devastating. Geese. Imagine if you were actually IN the car. It makes me appreciate life a lot more. Every day that we live is a blessing.  Ok, didn't mean to sound all spiritual on you. But I have to go now, because I am hungry, and I want to go to other websites. I will try to write as soon as I can.   Ciao for now!  Love,   *Sophie*
