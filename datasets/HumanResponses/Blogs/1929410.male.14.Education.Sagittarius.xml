         Today was surprisingly shocking.  When I attended the first session of the briefing of 'Mr and Ms Teen', I learned that we had to perform either a skit, a dance or a song!  Well, I called my emergency hotline (Mrs Kathryn Koh), and oh...she was so swift in getting things done.  She wants to use up the time to its max (5 minutes), and already got the script and the necessary chroneographer (however you spell it) ready.  That's fast.   Hmmz, went for my first session of A Maths Remedial...they were so bored, that Kwang Ren actually suspected I dyed my hair, and it led others to think so!  He even bothered to ask LG whether it's really true...she just gave a smile, and I'm not sure what that means...even Kr suspected I do some 'rebel' things.  Sheesh.  I made it a policy in life not to drink, not to take drugs, not to smoke and all that for the sake of my health.  But since they can't believe, oh well.

       So happy!  I received a call from the Bradell height committee, that I got through the next round of Mr and Ms Teen Awards!  It's the last round, and they are going to train us to be de Mr and Ms Teen for our schools.  I called my 2 'benefactors', Mrs Koh and Mrs Wong and informed them about the exciting piece of news.  They were also surprised...i mean, with 1000 contestants from all over the country, anyone will get surprised too!  I'm now assured of for the $500 Consolation Prize...of course I hope I win, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  This week is looking up on me, as first i clinched a job deal with ST for their new teenager newspaper, which will be launched next year.  Then, I got through Mr and Ms Teen Awards!  -_-

       Muahaha, finally I have Gmail!  With this, I can store 1Gb of mails, way way way cooler than hotmail or yahoo.  1Gb is very important for me...need it to send and receive projects, and stuffs like that...especially when it comes simultaneously.  No longer will I need to wait for the e-mail to come, download the necessary files and delete it.  Now, I can just store it!  Haha, can laugh at hotmail users...wait till we send out more than 6mb e-mail to them...(ERRR)...and as for my teachers, they are stuck with their edumail...always hit by server problems, server maintainence...how to e-mail them important stuffs like that?  With gmail, it's all different...the interface and all...

         Yeah, just concluded the ST Media Camp yesterday...the 2nd of the series of my camp this holidays...once I get over my last camp this week, I'm free!  Although the Publications still got a lot of administrative stuff to conclude...oh well...    Happy that I got a job invitation...a first in my life -_-.  This December, I will be working with ST Life and Sumiko Tan for a week.  After which I'm to observe their sub-editing and management work, before embarking on a 16-page teenager newspaper, which will be inserted into the ST.  Cool huh...of coz, not one's gonna noe anything as we are to keep it a secret till the newspaper actually releases...which is next January...    Had finished my Biology and SS homework...finally, I'm into my final phases of my homework, the E & A Maths Homework, of which I'm finishing E Maths Assignment...but it's the last obstacle which I hate most: Trigonometry and Geometry.  For some reasons, I can get over algebra and a whole lot others, but not these 2.  Troublesome man.  Desmond Chew out-
