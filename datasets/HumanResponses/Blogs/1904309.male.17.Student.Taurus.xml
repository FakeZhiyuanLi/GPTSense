      What up. Whoops, I skipped a day.....oh well executive privilege. Plus that last post got some pretty long replies, but I guess that's politics for you. Just got back from a nice run. Lately I've been running a whole lot, not sure why. It just makes me feel better that I eat way too much crap I guess. Meh. Onto other things. Today I plan to worry some more about how two hurricanes are blasting their way right through Morgan's cruise. The best part is I haven't heard from her since Saturday, nor can I due to excessive phone bills and ironic circumstances. So today's paper informs me that I know nothing about flirts twin hurricanes, or her safety. I have one word for that. Shit. Beyond that I plan to blast some heads off and get AWPed a lot while playing Counterstrike. Its fun and it helps me relax with all the crazy stuff going on in my life. Its been so crazy lately, that its even more crazy than crazy. Nah, I'm such a liar, nothing is going on. I thought I'd jazz things up a bit. Oh and the iPod still rocks. Whoever can correctly identify the source of this posts title first gets a whole post dedicated to them.

      What up. It feels good to finally be back in New York. Now that I'm home I have some concerns to voice. I think everyone needs to chill with the extreme views on both Bush and Kerry. On one side, Bush is not the evil money grabbing oil tycoon mass murderer as everyone on the loony left is claiming. If extreme liberal Michael Moore is to become the ultimate authority on the truth, then I am deporting myself to England. While I'm sure some of his movie was somewhat close to the truth, his 'facts' do not convince me. How can you listen to someone so totally bias in everything they say? Its difficult for me to believe he didn't tilt a little left with some of the material. So give Bush a break, everything he does from a round of golf to important speeches seems to upset everyone so much. Everyone says he talks stupid, yeah well he has a pretty damn good education, no doubt about that. But enough with criticisms of the Liberals, the Conservative side has its many issues as well. John Kerry is not a criminal who stole a Vietnam record, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. He served his time, so give it a rest. He saved a life. He was brave. I do agree with looking further into his record only for the fact that he made an integral part of his campaign beefing up his heroism, but stop the slander for crying out loud. This is a political race, not a finger pointing who-sucks-more-a-thon. This election is almost as bad as the Miller/Budweiser commercial war. Is Kerry a flip flopper? Yes. Does Bush has some severe sentence structure issues? Yes. Does Kerry look like Herman Muenster? Yes. Does Bush not give a shit about the UN? Yes. Does Kerry have some very unclear plans? Yes. Each candidate has their flaws. The country seems to forget that NO ONE is perfect. What I personally would like to see is not another Bush is ruining our lives article or another Kerry said this last week and now says this article. How about a side by side comparison? Personally the debate (there will be one right?) will settle this election for me. Until then if all I read is about how evil Bush is or about how weak Kerry is, I'll remain for Bush. And this is why: A) I think everything Michael Moore says is crap and B) The terrorists know that Bush will come after them without the support of everyone in the UN and without a thought. I'll just be glad when this election is over and we stop fighting like this is sports or something. Despite our efforts, we are still susceptible to attack. And being divided into blue and red isn't going to help us unite against the terrorists. They are, after all, the biggest block to World Peace right now. I don't care who does is, Bush, Kerry, Nader....I would just like to see terrorism end, and the world lose its need for fighting. Imagine all the people, living in peace. Good old John Lenon. Man he would've hated Bush.

      What up. Wattup Brian, what's goin on man? Haven't seen you all summer. Hope life is good. Tell Veronica I said hi. Aight, on to new business. This post has one purpose, to alert the general public on the amazingness of the apple iPod. A few days ago my Dad got one for free for speaking at this conference in SF. This morning I awoke to the beautiful sounds of an Italian aria....But no, unfortunately it was not Nici Paggs and her angelic voice. Yet it was almost as good. I found an ear piece in my ear and my Dad grinning. Last night we bought the USB cable we needed to hook up the iPod, which I otherwise had figured out, to my Dads laptop. This morning he set up iTunes to organize all the music he had onto the iPod. The gorgeous sound that the iPod pumped out was amazing. I was literally dancing around the hotel room grooving to everything from 50 Cent to the Jayhawks. Those commercials with people dancing do not lie... This thing really makes you dance like no one is watching. The sound is so full and incredible, props to the guys at Apple CA, the crew who made this thing the awesome machine it is. Its lightweight, slim and VERY portable. But the best part is the 15 GB hard drive, able to hold over 10,000 songs. That means every song in my house will be on this thing with room to spare. The ultimate song library. Hell, its already the best thing ever and it only has 300 something songs on it from my Dads laptop. The plane ride will be anything but boring now.

      What up. Damn I walked a whole lot today, and my feet feel like Mike Tyson last week. Man he got his butt whooped. Anyway I started off my day with a terrific trip to the top of Coit tower. The tower is shaped like a fire hose nozzle, but resembles other things as well. It's a monument erected (clever choice of words here) to honor firefighters who.....Wait I mentioned this yesterday right? Well instead of finding the bus we decided to climb the steps to the tower (since its on the biggest hill in the city, which coincidentally is full of hills). 424 steps later we stood at the foot of the tower, where it was either more steps, or an elevator (guess what we picked). Great view. From the top you could see the whole bay, except Alcatraz, which was covered in a mysterious fog (ooooooooo). Our next stop was pier 45, where we got on a boat and sailed off to Alcatraz itself, also known as 'The Rock'. It has a creepy presence, but the history of the place made walking around the island very fun. After much walking and exhaustion we wound up very tired, and walked about the piers till we decided to head back to the hotel. Here we sit, my dad sound asleep in a chair, and I quietly blogging in the background. Dinner after a long needed nap. I'll leave on this note... San Francisco is most certainly a very accepting community. Besides the abundance of heart statues (all painted differently, apparently some sort of theme here in SF), I saw an ad in the trolley today which cracked me up. It was an advertisement for a store called 'Gay Pride' reading: "My Dad went to Gay Pride, and all I got was another Dad". Funny stuff.

      Tonight me and my Dad stumbled upon the Bank of Guam. Matt and everyone from my French Class in tenth grade should be amused. Would you like a traditional Guamish meal of Guamza and GuamCola? Or maybe you just want to watch me walk into Matt's see-through french doors, or perhaps watch Matt make an absurd noise and cause me to spit soda all over him... All highlights of our 10th grade french project. See the timeless story of Pierre LeTrec as his helicopter crash lands in Guam, inadvertently landing him right near his long lost cousin. What a captivating story. Starring Joe Puglisi and Matt Singer, written and translated by Joe Puglisi, taped and narrated by Mike Melita, edited by Matt Singer. Featuring Music by the Julliana Theory and the latest helicopter special effects. Stay after the credits for special only-seen-once-in-our-french-class bloopers. Now available on VHS. This is film is not yet rated. Void where prohibited. Batteries not included. Sense not included either. No animals were harmed in the making of this film.

      What up. Though the title of this post is far from a possible nickname for me, I thought it would be an entertaining name, since an LL Cool J track from the eighties is now playing in my hotel room. Weird, huh? I just got back from a party at the W, a trendy hotel here in SF. The beat was hot in the XYZ bar, the second floor home to alcohol in the W; one of the coolest bars in town. Hell, the bar changes colors, how awesome is that? The conference my Dad spoke at today had a party there to celebrate winning magazine of the year (check it out, the name of the magazine is  urlLink ComputerWorld ). The editor in chief, MaryFran, is a nice lady, we chilled with her and this 30 year old my Dad knows named Katie. She was cool too, everyone thought I was a college kid, but whatever. I would have fit right in with the 20 something year olds who talked about the exact same thing as girls my age would anyway, like roommates and orgasms and other high school stuff which I was surprised yet expected to hear in a trendy bar in San Francisco on a Thursday night. Whatever, the bar was open and free, my kind of place. Also they had free food (dumplings and other hors d'oeuvres), which turned out to be quite a blessing. Dumplings must be the most misleading food in the world, because while the name dumplings, along with the appearance of dumplings are horribly unattractive, they are quite a pleasing food. The irony of the Chinese. Anyway, I forgot to explain how an LL Cool J CD got into the player here in my room...They were giving them out at the party since the theme of the bash was J-related. On the back cover they even make a list of similarities between the old-school rapper and ComputerWorld. Funny stuff. The party was even called "Don't call it a comeback", alluding to an LL Cool J song. On the table along with the CD they were giving out pimp necklaces with big money signs and stuff on them. The line of the night goes to the waiter who answered my "where's the bathroom" query. His reply: "Right there on the left, next to the bling bling table." Priceless.  P.S. I'd like to know if the readers think we should consider going back to Ask Madden, or keep up Wing Night. Add some extra sauce and lemme know what you think.

       holy shit i just made the best sandwich. i took healthy ingredients and made them kick my tongue's ass! (yes i know my tongue doesn't have an ass because then i'd be kissing ass all day) i took a boneless skinless chicken breast and diced it up, soaked it in hot sauce, cooked it. also sauteed up tomatoes and onions. put all ingredients on rye bread w/ red. fat cheddar on top. HUNGRY YET?? fuck wing night, now i can have a spicy chicken sandwich whenever i want and it DON'T COST A THING!!          yeh, anyway, today i told off one of my coworkers and almost pushed him into a pool. i havn't had the best week, you know, and he wasn't helping much. i decided it would be safest to just curse him out and go home. so i got home at 2, and am leaving my cell off so work cant call me. oh yeh, speaking of work if you for any reason go into my shop and the girl who answers phones asks about me (not expecting this to happen to anyone) i'm gay. i had to convince her i was gay this morning when i realized she was hitting on me. let me tell you, i am an AWESOME gay! i do it so well. well now i'm gonna go question my sexual preference and cry because i'm questioning my sexual preference. . . . sniff. . . bye.      1

       What up. Matty K was correct in saying that I'd be off West Coasting but no one counted on ethernet access at my hotel. This of course means regular updates while I'm here in San Francisco. Gangsta.   Anywho, I'm here in the lap of luxury in the Four Seasons Hotel on Market Street. Very cool. Can't say much more, gotta go grab some lunch. Count on regular posting while I'm here. Also count on sushi, because oh man is sushi big here. Expect sampling. Lots of it. Aight, Dad is hungee, and so am I. Stay tuned.

      ight yes. . . i know we just got this shit goin, but joeflyy and myself are taking a vacation. putting one entry in a new blog and forgetting about it is a hard job, you know. i'm leaving for new hampshire on saturday and i won't be back until the 23rd. i might get a chance to post while i'm up there, but chances are slimmer than. . . ight i can't think of anyone who's really skinny right now so put your own in there and laugh the night away. anyway , THEY'RE SLIM . hopefully i'll come back with some good news. i havn't heard good news in a long while. this world is overdue for some. as for my loyal teammate, he left for the west coast (the home of shitty rap music with no flava EAST COAST MOFUCKAS!!) with his pop late last evening. i'm not sure when he's returning but i'm sure he'll fill you in upon his arrival. well i have to head off to job # 2 (# 3 if you count this blog as a job, but i was just using that as a pun or whatever i did) so take it easy until i post again, and peace to all of you who say peace.  1

       What up. It appears that all it takes is a one and a half month absence from blogging to be unjustly thrown from what you have helped to create. Fine with me, myself and the man known as Stinga can hold our own, and of course any other refugees from the sinking of Ask Madden may also join us. Just contact me or Stinga and e-mail invites will fly. Anyway as for the history of Wing Night, the few very old fans of myself and Stinga's first rough attempt at a blog may recall this name was the original anti Ask Madden. Of course we were invited to join up shortly after its creation and the original does in fact still exist somewhere out there, but this is certainly an outrage bold enough to recall our old mantle for new use.  We will both of course be needing space to waste time and talk about our pointless existences once school has started again. I assure you the summer vacation whitnessed at Ask Madden will not occur here by myself. I will uphold this blog to the best of my abilities. So I hope that we can build as loyal a fanbase as Ask Madden had while it was in full swing. We will not betray you Loyal Readers. On with the blogging!

       my name is M! K! S to the tinga!  my flow is crazy and it aint no thing-a!  now that that nonsense is out of the way, welcome to the resurrected wing night!! blog.  i noticed that adam has booted me off ask madden, and rightly so i suppose seeing as i did not blog for a fortnight or so.  (fortnight definition, anyone?  streva?)  maybe i'll keep this one up to date, we'll have to play it out.  i have a lot of devastating crap i could tell you, but i'm bottling it up for now.  we'll see how shit goes down.  i am posting from ali's room simultaneously with joeflyy because we know how to get shit done.  i'm taking off for new  hemp shire on saturday.  i'll be there for a few weeks.  and, no, i was never in idaho.  miscommunication i sum it up to be.  yeh well i'm out cuz i don't like to type, especially when it has to make sense.    1
