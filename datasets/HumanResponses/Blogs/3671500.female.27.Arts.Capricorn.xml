						   While revisiting the debate over Columbus' heritage, I recalled the media frenzy surrounding former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright when a writer for  The Washington Post  uncovered her long-lost Jewish heritage.  Albright's surprised response to the discovery provided much critical fodder for the opponents of her politics.  I googled around and found some articles both  urlLink  against   and in  urlLink  defense   (and others more  urlLink  neutral in tone  ) concerning Albright.  Had the media of today been around in Columbus' time, is it safe to assume he might have been lynched for concealing his identity?  Certainly if he were proven to be Jewish, its safe to assume he would be burned at the stake by the radical Christians of the time!

						   Not many people are aware of this, but there has been an ongoing dispute centering on the remains of Christopher Columbus.  Both Spain and The Dominican Republic claim to both possess the true remains.  Imagine the tourist revenue that would be forfeited if the remains of either country to be proven fake.  Both countries apparently did, reportedly denying scientists the opportunity to perform genetic experimentation to confirm the validity of their respective remains.  Well, in a exciting turn of events, Spain has finally agreed to allow scientists the opportunity to exhume what "remains" of Columbus from his tomb in order to confirm their authenticity.  The Dominican Republic, however, remains cagey, again denying (by simply not responding!) the scientists from laying a white gloved finger on their tomb!  Please visit  urlLink MSNBC's link to read more on this fascinating story .  What's so awesome (yes, AWESOME!) is that DNA testing could lead to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to finally unearth the origins of Columbus' heritage.  Long-recognized as an Italian, some scholars have argued that Columbus may have been Catalonian or even Jewish.   urlLink Check out this COMPREHENSIVE site to read more on the debate that rages on .

						   Did you know that San Francisco's been celebrating Columbus Day for over 135 years?  Neither did I.  My fellow peeps in San Francisco put on an annual  urlLink Italian Heritage Parade  celebrating the achievements of Italians, including that most famous "Italian" of all, Christopher Columbus!

						   The arguments dismantling Columbus' Italian heritage are more than just wishful thinking.   They stem from thorough academic research into the the many inconsistencies surrounding his life.  This  urlLink essay  addresses those things already known about Columbus that could lead one to believe he was in fact Jewish.

						   Well, who would have thought  Weekly Universe  would actually have a  urlLink serious piece  featuring controversial "facts" on Christopher Columbus.  Some of what they bring up are points brought up by serious scholars of Columbus.  If you don't visit their homepage, you'd think their whole enterpise was legit.  That is to say you should visit their homepage and learn a little something about space aliens too!
