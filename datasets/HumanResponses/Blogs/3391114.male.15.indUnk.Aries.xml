      Well, May 28th, 2004. G-Day. TechTV and G4 merge. To form one network. G4TechTV. Very original name ain't it? So far I've seen only one TechTV show on, which was X-Play. At 7 The Screen Savers will be back, thank god they didn't get canned. Anime Unleashed will be on tonight at midnight and will be running for a few hours. Before that Unscrewed with Martin Sargent and Laura Swisher. Basically, the best and some of the worst (like Robot Wars etc.) was carried over from TechTV and G4 took all their (in my opinion, shitty) shows and slapped a new logo on the TV station... great...

      Well well, I went to the top bunk of my bed, searching for Freelancer, and what did I find? I found the power and AV cables for my Dreamcast. So I went under my bed and found the old white beast. After dusting it off I plugged in all the connections, put in my Quake III Arena disc, and asked myself one question. Why did this thing fail? Visually, it's better than the PS2. Controller wise, it's better than the XBox and the GameCube. (The Playstation controller can not be defeated, it is the standard IMHO) The Dreamcast is a great system, again, in my humble opinion. Why oh why did it fail? I'll never know...

      Ah, as I sit back, and look at the title of this website, it's very vague. Well, lucky me! I can put EVERYTHING that interests me (material interests) in here. Well, where to start. Here's the product of a Photoshop tutorial by Digital Disguise...     Well, here are some interesting conspiracies of the day...  Washington DC, is it satanic? My personal opinion is that it is evil, the government is an evil thing, but that doesn't make it satanic. To many conspirators Washington DC is full of cover-ups and secrets. If you look at maps of DC, you will notice that it is laid out in pentagrams which are masonic symbols. Some say that the city, when it was designed, was made to be a power to rule the world, a central source of satanic power.  The Pentagon, HQ for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. The shape and name itself only fuel the fire of conspirators. It has been behind such happenings like the testing of LSD on GI's in the 1950's and spraying germs on U.S citizens in a subway experiment, by the way, the citizens didn't know. Now, what is my opinion on all of this you ask? Well, I believe that it is NOT a coincedence that Washington DC is laid out the way it is. The designers knew what they were doing. I am certainly not pro-government. They have done a lot of things in my mind that are just wrong. So I believe that it is totally possible that Washington DC was laid out to be the ultimate satanic world power, a central point of all eveil. The Pentagon, yes well, it has all branches of the armed forces in one place. It has so much security and a LOT of the information of what goes on there is not viewable by the public, not even under the Freedom Of Information act.  Gay marriage in Massachusetts: Good.   Iraqi prisoner abuse: Only about 10% of all the abuse will be publically known and in the news. The other 90% is so bad Rumsfeld won't let it out.  Well, that's about all I have to say for today. I bid you adieu.  Digitally Yours, FreakLikeThou   All images hosted by ImageShack.us

      Well, G4TechTv is about two weeks old now (I think.) Regardless, here are my opinions on the new channel. Most of G4's shows are pieces of shit. Sweat, is stupid. Cheat, we don't need a show with a moronic and cheesy host about cheats. Icons, is actually good, I like it. G4TV.Com, I've yet to see a new episode. Players, dumb. Arena, 90% of the teams are cheap players aka campers. So yeah, those are basically my opinions of the shows and the new chennel... but I still watch Screensavers (which just started) every nite. Bring back Leo god damnit.
