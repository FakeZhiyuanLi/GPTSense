      At the moment, I'm in an odd sort of mood. It's like a surreal incompletion. An empty serenity - a nearly eerie contentness.   It didn't rain today - it poured. The sky opened up and it seemed as if solid walls of water surounded us. Of course I started the day off right by running and dancing in it with my friends. I love the rain, espescially when it's appropriate for playing in. Really heavy rain can lighten everyone's mood, if you're out in it. Others see it as a limitation - an obstacle that leaves them trapped indoors. But what harm did a little water ever cause anyone? It's like a swimming pool in the air!   A freshman thought I was a sophomore. Some of my mother's friends thought I was 14. I don't wanna look old, I deffinately don't want to look like everyone else - I like being me usually, even if "me" appears to be 14. But I would like to feel atractive every now and then. I mean I'm not a beauty queen or love goddess, but I like to think I'm a nice girl, and that surely someone wants my company. It would be nice to be asked on a date or something - just something to make me feel not completely repulsive.   I mean, I'm happy- I played in the rain and danced around with people I've known forever and people I've known a few weeks and they love me and I adore them. I just wanna be pampered I guess, once in a while. Ya know, feel like a girl. *sigh*  Anyway so I'm in a kind of daze, a place of wonderment at my situation of happiness mixed with a false loneliness. I suck at putting this into words. Is it too cliche to say I just wanna be held?   ick. that just sounds so- girly mushy gushy. I disgust me sometimes. :/  My bed is calling however, and I cannot deny it my presence.   Dreams yo.

      Okay so I'm still not completely done pasting stuff from my old blog, but I'm close. This is stuff that I didn't write, but I think is absolutely beautiful.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Haiku Innuendo  Solace from such small words...   So rare a flower Delicate to touch and taste To own it blasphemy   ~Derek~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I'm 'back' persay. Return? What the hell would that be?  I say it doesn't exist - any real 'return'. 'You' cannot return because 'you' are no longer 'you' when 'you' leave a part of 'you' behind.   ~ again Derek, written upon his return to TN, perhaps some of the most painful words I've ever read ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I find myself yet again a chrysalis of pain and hate. I don't think I'll ever escape it. Or want to. It's comfortable to me now. So easy to hate, to destroy; eventually we all succumb to it, I have only lept time and begun my ascention early. Or rather, reclimbed my old pedistol, rejoined my old self. Foolish of me. I cannot help but wonder what is in store for this aggression I hold so dear. To what end do I clutch it so dearly? At the same time, I clutch eagerly to the better qualities I possess. I'm not all pain and hate, as no one can claim, and what many have; I am but human, and therefore have my own demons to subdue.    ~yup still him~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  La Belle Dame Sans Merci I saw their starved lips in the gloam With horrid warning gaped wide, And I awoke and found me here On the cold hill's side.   And this is why I sojourn here, Alone and palely loitering, Though the sedge is withered from the lake, And no birds sing.    ~an excerpt from a beautiful poem we studied in class~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "Nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands" - EE Cummings.   ~~~~~~~~~~  A Touch. Like Cold Rain. Perhaps we should kill the pupa? Let life suck us dry? Maybe we should cut it down, maybe force our dreams to die. Perhaps we should make it suffer? Torture; make it squeel. Let us then stop the chrysalis! Let's finally crack the wheel, break the cycle, and end the game; Destroy the circle, and finally cover these fruitless shames.   ~Derek~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   The essence of your presence presents Me with a sunset, an eye set, something God-sent, To which I give thanks for, And why I speak frank more, And more is what you hand to me In each grasp of palms, Every contact of calm, And you come to me when it need not be, Though I love and need you like a sea inside me, A storm of care that dares to be bare and fair, All that which I find rare is borne from the scent of your hair, So that I forevermore am never sore In the softest place of my body, my heart, Because to me you embody the part That was left missing, even before we met, It was you I was missing, And now you are here and only your voice I hear, Even when you do not speak, you are the most clear, Because your language is love, not at all foreign, It is as universal as purity and sin, Yet you are the counter to all that is wrong in my soul, You are the counter I lean on, my ultimate goal. I love you.   ~Amin Issa~    Written for a girl he's apparantly been dreaming of for 3 years. That part is irrelevant. What is relevant is that in my entire day of anger at politicians and teachers and my best friends, in discovering with each new step that something else is wrong with the world, I come home and he says can I show you this poem I wrote? I have much to learn and think about.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Never Let you down  We are all here for a reason on a particular path You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math Kats think i'm delerious but i'm so damn serious That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world I'm tryna make it better for these little boys and girls I'm not just another individual My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual But i get my hymns from him So it's not me it's he that's lyrical I'm not a miracle I'm a heaven sent instrument  My rhythmatic regement navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental That's why i'm instrumental  Vibrations is what i'm into Yeah i'm makin my loot everyday But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kuinte I'm tryna give us free like ---------------  I can't stop that's why i'm hot  Determination dedication motivation I'm talking to you of my many inspirations What I said I can't let you or self down If i'm on the highest cliff On the highest riff And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life And my grip I would neva eva let you down And when these words am found Let it be known that gods penmanship has been signed with a language called love That's why my breath is felt by the death And while my words are heard it confined to the ears of the blind I to dream in color and in rhyme So I guess i'm one of a kind in a full house Cause whenever I open my heart my soul or my mouth a touch of god reigns out  ~Kayne West~

      Okay so before this blog I had another, which I allowed noone but my very old friend Derek to read, because for some reason which I've really never understood, I've never felt the need to keep anything from him - not that he cares about any of it, maybe that's the reason, but I don't have to be afraid to be human and be vulnerable with him. Anyway so I wrote and he knew it was there whether he ever read it or not i really don't know, but now I wanna progress to my own blog, partially because I forgot how to log in to my old one, but also because while I love him, and miss him, that friendship isn't what it used to be, which, is a good thing, for we both grew to a point of independence that I didn't know I could achieve. Anyway, so I'm here now. These are excerpts from my old entries, things I didn't wanna forget. (be glad I didn't repost the entire journal).    ~~~~~~~~Jan 18~~~~~~~~~~~~  The other day I told Derek I'd love to lean over a cliff, one of those that hangs over the rocky ocean waters of california. I want to lie down on it and hang my head over the edge and scream at the waters until they listen to me. Until they're quiet and I am the presence... with the power of the waves to crush anything against the jagged rocks or pull it away, with the beauty of the sunlight reflected in the waters, to capture any one's heart, and the serenity of the waves steady beating against the shore to comfort anyone who was hurting.    I want to know I'm alive. I want to run screaming naked down the beach, or climb a snow-capped mountain and stand atop it and watch an avalanche somewhere beneath me.  I wanna go dancing, and I wanna flirt with the band until they let me sing lead-- sing the way I sing at home with a good bowl of ice cream and the right music.  I want to tell somebody I love them, in a way they can't help but love me back. I want to die in a storm out at sea, on a sail boat.    The other day, Mandy, only half joking, said she wished that she could have an adventure like in her video games, and books, and anime shows. "Life is so boring" she said. But it isn't. It's just us, we're too stubborn and sure that it has to be a certain way to be good. It's so sad. I hope that no matter what I do, I never forget what it is to feel like this.   ~~~~~~~~~~Jan 19~~~~~~~~~  ...So I tried to unleash the emotion on the piano, and I couldn't play anything right. Not even Eyes On Me. I wanted so badly to scream. It's always been kind of my dream, along with dying in a storm out at sea, I'd like to let down my gaurd long enough just once to throw a real fit, to yell and kick and punch and throw things, breakable things. And then have someone there to catch me when I fall back crying. So many times I feel like doing that, but so far I've been the well reserved, fair mannered child.   I made another list of wishes:   How I wish I could play the drums well. Just sit down and turn up the stereo and let it all out, and be happy again. Or run, throw on the sweats and run for miles until I'm so tired I can't remember what was bothering me. Or drive, drive so fast and far that I get completely lost. I don't want to know where I am anymore.   ~~~~~~~Jan 21~~~~~~~~~  an excerpt from an entry inspired by an old note I found from my very dear friend John:   My Dearest Little Sister,  Sometimes in life we fail to see the happiness that one brings to our life to the fullest extent. Missing the subtle, selfless acts that some people do for everyone's benefit, we foolishly take these people for granted. You are one of those people, Sis. No matter how many times I look into your eyes, I can't help but see a beautiful and loving person inside.   With every smile and hug you give, you brighten another person's day. But we take for granted the fact that you are a very caring person. We take for granted the fact that without you there to brighten our day we would all be lost to fits of depression. We take your love for granted.  ~John~    ...The goodness of John. The innocent naieve lovable John. How could I have let him go ever? How I love him. He is the person described in his letter, Not me...I'm so inspired. By John, by Charlotte, by Ben to better apreciate the people around me. I'm so in awe of Monica to live so openly, so uncautiously. Mandy, the one most taken for granted, most often overlooked. She has a heart that most never see. She's more easily shattered than one might think, oh but she's so strong, for her mother. She'd give her life away so that her mother would be happy -- Selfless. I want to become them.  ~~~~~~~Jan 30~~~~~~~ On nights like these he(Sam) makes me thankful that there are people in the world that don't put themselves first. I always wanna be one of those people, but I'm not.   ~~~~~~~~Feb 05~~~~~~~~~~ My life is a song without Melody. I hate songs without melody. They tend to go on and on building tension or excitement, but never provide a release. My life is a song without melody because I can't prioritize. Familyschoolfriendsmusicmocktrialsyouthlegboyfriendsliteraturereputationsleepeternalquestionsfuturepastpresentverbalvommit. That's the name of my song. I wish I were a cat, with 9 lives. one to screw up with- to learn. a second to be rich with. a third to be dirt poor with. a fourth for law. 5th for psychology. 6th for music. 7th and 8th to love with. The last to teach with.   ~~~~~~~Feb 17~~~~~~~~ Ew. That's my reaction to life right now. It's a gooey green glob. Not even green. At least that's a vibrant color. No, it's grey. It's a murky grey glob. And someone has poked it with a stick.   ~~~~~~~~Feb 26~~~~~~~ How do you fix things like this? I envy John on some levels. Like I told Ben, I wish I believed enough in prayer to think it would help. Or like Tara in fate and Karma. I wish I could believe that everything I did was irrelevent in the divine scheme of things because it's "meant" to be a certain way. But I'm stuck in a world where everything I say or do has consequences. . . And we will get past it but we will not mend . . . I hate that life is real now. It used to be so escapable...  ~~~~~~Mar 13~~~~~~~~~~ I will say this. This mood I am in right now, is only a half truth. It is not completely real. But then again, what is? I have lost respect for someone that I have always admired and I am hurt because of it. Last night, I had a lot to think about, and it consumed me, and reality crushed my naivety. Today I have changed but then when are we not changing? I used to run screaming from the thought, and now I accept it. Change is a part of life. The way in which we apply that change is where its worth is measured. I don't know a lot of things. I don't know what I want out of life, or an after life, or what of any of it is real. But I do know that if I ever stop learning from others, I have become someone that I do not want to be.   ~~~~~~~~~Mar 20~~~~~~~~~~~~ proof of beauty within... tonight was the first time in a very long time that I've felt even remotely at home in the world.

      Written on Valentine's Day - There exists both a literal and symbolic meaning behind my riddle, but I would be more than a little surprised should someone understand my origional meaning. Anyway I thought it sounded pretty so I'm keeping it from my old blog.    Velvet Red  So coveted. So Admired. Picked from a million only you, alone.  Your thorns gone away --  Only the soft red velvet to carress my lips. Only the sweet enchantment  to draw my nose to thee.  My life flows through thee; you open unto me.  How do I best enjoy thee? Your thorns gone away, I am not afraid.  Vulnerable Delicate Beauty,  Dare I reach? Velvet curls,  sooner worn and tired.  Dare I tear? The velvet spread around, to be loved, once. Never whole again.  Or do I preserve? In your entirety, your beauty and your sanctity. Your life denied, radiance stolen.  Always there are others. Always, I want you.

      So I've screwed up a lot, yet I've survived. I've made new friends and by some miracle held on to the old ones. I'm stronger. I still feel young and bewildered by my suroundings. Sometimes I feel lost, and always I am without direction. Disapointing, discouraging, dissatisfying - the three d's of my past year.   But I survived! I'm me, more than ever before. For the first time ever I'm not following people around with my tail between my legs trying to squeeze into conversation - I'm just naturally welcome. It's so nice to not be afraid to be alone.   As with so many things, I wish I could explain it. There are a few things I would have done differently, but I didn't know then what I do now, as lame as that sounds.   Anyway I'm happy. I look forward to tomorrow whatever it may hold. And I think I like my new blog. I wonder if I'll let people read this one.

       Last night was so great. I wasn't locked out of the great secret circle of people. There was no secret circle it was tons of fun and almost like old times. New kid- Nathan- very awesome guy. cept that he doesn't vote, that will have to be remedied, but for real,&nbsp;I think he'll fit well with the rest of us.     &nbsp;  I wish here was someone to be all excited for me about today. I can drive! woo hoo.    Dr. Dillaman, if something bad is happening to the animals, we've got to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a wizard.  &nbsp;

      In the mood to be beautiful. Want a guy to take me out somewhere nice and treat me special just for one night.  &nbsp; I'm not like other people. I guess I come off as immature, but my naievity is more than that. I respect myself, and I learn from the mistakes of others, as well as from my own. I'm content. I just wanna be pretty.

      so today sucked and i have all sorts of ugly words running through my head right now. i want to be strong. i want to be happy. i want to be respectable. i want to be good at something. i wish i could control my tears better. i wish i could keep more inside.  &nbsp; but i'm so glad for people. for people that hug me and make up stupid songs and dances for me and try and tell other people to go away for me and look at me with eyes that say what words just can't. &nbsp; people are so funny, how they can be so comical and hardened against any real thought or emotion, then suddenly become more sensitive than could be thought possible. Like that time I was at Jeffrey's and he was playing with his cat. His face got all soft, relaxed. Standing in line at Disney, little kids playing with older brothers, you know those teens don't act that way around their own friends. (btw there is nothing more sexy than a guy good with kids).  &nbsp; God I hope I'm not on a gong. I don't wanna just be there, I want to have a purpose. I wish I could go running right now. Oh how good that would feel.  &nbsp; anyway, g'night - here's hoping for a better tomorrow

      Okay I danno how to spell Cochroach, but there was a HUGE one in band today. Jeffrey saw it first and scrunched his face up all funny, and then he showed Jessica and she kinda shrunk away from it with her "Eew" and then we all craned our necks to see what Jeffrey described the Mother of all Cochroaches. Dave made us ignore it. A little later it crawled past me. I feel sick thinking about it. I don't take well to bugs. Espescially big gross ones. And I mean he was soooooooo big and gross. And I've never really studied a roach before ya know, so now I have this image in my head of this huge ugly thing and this line down the center of his back with little white lines going horizontally across it and lots of legs and it just crawled and crawled. Ew. I feel quezy now. Anyway it went over to Lindsey, and I caught her attention and pointed it out and she made faces, and Rickey saw it and came over and kicked it out from her playing spot and then squashed it. I didn't witness the actual squashing, but I saw him kick it and then I heard the stomp of his foot and the poor gross thing is now a pile of mush on the floor. With the stomp came chills. It took me a sec to shake them. It was gross and I don't like bugs, but it must've known it was going to die, doncha think? With the kicking and all I mean, and it was so helpless. Just squash.   Dave missed rehearsal yesterday cuz he had to go to a funeral. Today we talked about death. Funerals we've been to- we shared stories about touching dead people in their caskets as curious children. Suicides- jumping from buildings, the emotional scars that must leave on everyone that sees it. Fears- ways we absolutely would hate to die. Even hopes- if we could choose, how would we go.   Well I'm tired and still feeling cruddy about the roach. I'm off to bed, another long day awaits me.

      this has got to be like my 3rd or 4th entry today but I'll be gone next week so that's okay.   Derek lives!!!  nothing makes my day more than a random "I love you" in an IM. I bet it's been more than a month, maybe 2 since I've heard from him. I had just convinced myself that we'd finally grown apart and that somehow that was okay because we're both okay on our own now, and the important thing is we helped each other get to where we are now. But when his little messaging window popped up I knew I must've been smokin somethin cuz I still love him like mad and no matter how much our lives have changed or how little we see each other, he's still Derek, and the magnitude behind that title, as most of my oldest friends know, is immeasurable. And, he said "I love you" - 6 years ago he would've never done that. It's wild. But it meant that I'm not clinging hopelessly to a lost friendship. "Where've you been?" "away" - some things never change. He is the mystery of my life. Well, one of the many, one of the best. Maybe he'll come see me for my birthday. I wonder if he has his license yet......  okay so I'm in love with the world and i get to go to disney world and party while mandy and charlotte and ben serve as my servants, checking my email and calling me to lemme know about the stupid school stuff. I'm so happy. I want a trampoline. I wanna jump on it and yell and sing and then take a pillow and blanket out to it and sleep under the stars.  Happy 4th of July everyone.

      When I was doing research on the stupid situation with the school board, I found this:   I shake with chills and wonder why   it's colder than outside.   My textbook pages need some glue;  in fact, it seems I'm missing two.  The halls are packed, my locker's broke,  the lunchroom's fogged in hazy smoke.  The doors don't close; the window sticks.  My novel's dated '46.   I gasp as my aged desk chair creaks.  It hasn't broken in two weeks.  We need relief; it's not too late.  Today the lights are working great.  With budget cuts and stacks of bills,  rain pours through cracks; the classroom fills.  Our classes were outside last week.   No need to worry; just a leak.  The ceiling's cracked, the walls are chipped.  The chalkboard's white and the floors are tipped.  We only need a little aid,   if just to buy a can of Raid.  In smoky, musty, freezing air,  I cough and shake. It isn't fair.  Jessica Boelter, age 17  New Ulm High School, New Ulm   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  They are going to cut all the first-year teachers. Why would the governor want to cut our education when he got his education? That is so stupid.  Mercedes Steward, age 9  Marcy Open School, Minneapolis ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I think that cutting school budgets is a bad idea if we kick teachers out of their jobs. How do you think they would feel? Think before you do something. They should give schools more money because some schools can't even afford stuff like computers, laptops, desks, chairs, books and other important stuff. I thought Jesse cared more about education. Think about the students' future. How can we get jobs in the future without an education?  Yeng Yang, age 11  Hancock Hamline University Magnet School, St. Paul  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I don't really understand the budget cuts, but I may have come up with a solution that I think may work. We could sell all the schools and everything in them and use the money to buy a laptop computer for everyone. The schoolwork could be e-mailed every day to the students, and when the work is done, the day is over. If the work is not done, a private tutor paid by the parents would come to help. After a student learns so much, they can take a test that determines whether he can move up a grade or stay at the one they're on and learn more. Each district can keep one or two buildings for meeting once a week. In order to fit all the kids into one building, they would have to break the kids up into groups and have one group meeting a day. I think this could work someday. I know it would work for me. I wouldn't have to get out of bed as early.  Kyle Vasen, age 13  Coon Rapids ACE, Coon Rapids ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  At least the kids are trying. What's wrong with this country, that kids understand things so muhc better than adults do?

      When was the last time you looked at an infant and thought, "well his life will be a complete waste and failure"? When did you last know someone that died with absolutely no regrets?  If these occurances are so rare, then why is it okay to look at a school with 1800+ teenagers and not only accept but anticipate the likely failure of 70% of them?  I thought this was America, the land of the free. I thought that all men were created equal, and that everyone was supposed to be given a shot at life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I guess I missed the memo that teens are exluded from these opportunities, espescially those from poor families. Since when is 15 old enough to label someone hopeless? When did it become okay to stop all efforts towards a decent furture for kids that made a few mistakes, or worse, because their parents did?  I think I know the answer- since certain adults found their way into power and money, they have the responsibility but not the time or concern for these "hopeless" teenagers.   I'm disgusted. My local school board and county commission are too busy feuding with each other to do their jobs. The final vote on budget cuts will come on tuesday, and the vote on the supposedly neccessary tax comes on wednesday. I'll be gone for both. I doubt that even with these massive cuts I'll be dramatically effected in my last year of school, but others will, and in the years to come it can only get worse. Just the thought, of grown men and women - educated and trusted by the community, being so immature and at such an enormous cost, it's mind numbing.

      just wanted to say hello. today was interesting. bryan came. i miss him, adore him.   i was delerious at lunch, andy's sister's are probably scared of me now- sleep deprivation can do strange things to a person. i'm just kind of hovering now, until time for bed. but still i've enjoyed the day. tomorrow is a half day- so i don't have to do everything tonight.   It's not weird being a senior, tho i thought it would be. What's weird is looking at Jeffrey and Jessica and AJ and thinking about them being juniors. That makes me feel old. And none of them are taking AS. I'm dissapointed, but I can't really blame them. band and AS and a job plus their very active families would be a lot to swallow. Still, they're old. Only they're babies. I wonder if they'd be offended that I thought like that.  I love our teachers this year. Dave. Heather. Lee. I wish we never had to spend time with the rest of the band, or espescially other instructors. I wish it could just be us all day.  I'm learning to march. The drum doesn't even hurt my back anymore. Of course I have like the smallest one, heh. My legs cramp a lot tho - not that that's new, it's just a pain when marching.   It's still raining. That makes me so happy. So relaxed, and still very delierious. Ignore the bad spelling. Ignore this whole entry - it's full of senseless rambling and poor grammar too.   my friends laugh at me cuz when they say something bad about the pit and i get defensive, or when i'm excited over something like my car, my eyes get really big.  yup.  there's this freshman named Rickey, he's a doll. his brother graduated my first year, and then last year his sister came and we were friends, and now he's here, and so excited about everything. it's so easy to work with kids like him.   Billy is playing the timpani in the ballad. he's a brave kid. I'll miss him when I graduate.   I want something, but I danno what. Besides sleep- that's obvious. I danno why I'm this tired, but it's kinda fun. Anyway, happy unbirthday.

      I'm still here, believe it or not. Tara has kidnapped me and taken me to the land of Xanga, which is lame cuz everybody and his mother reads it. How can I write anything worth reading if I know someone will actually read it? Anyway I've escaped long enough to write an update, cuz if I don't write now I just might explode later.  I like AJ. Complete honesty in this journal, if I put that in the other one he'd end up reading it one day or some one else would be like.... ew she's a child molester or somethin. I can't spell molester. :/ Anyway I can't help it - I do like him, I mean, I think he's awesome and I love spending time with him. Really I'd love to spend more time with him no matter what level it's on. But I'm also catching a bit of spring fever here at the end of summer, so it's hard to be around him and not overflow with emotion.  It's also incredibly annoying for me to be so not in control of the moment.  Two years ago it would not have been a problem. But then, that was when my life was all about falling in love and raising happy little kids and spreading happiness everywhere.  Those things are still important to me, but in a much more realistic way.  After my break up with Coozer at the beginning of sophomore year, I wanted alone time, really for the first time.  But then I got so used to my own independence, that when Sam came along, I couldn't committ. There were a lot of issues that factored in to the failure of that relationship, but a big problem was that it was my first serious relationship. When I say serious, I mean that I grew a brain. For the first time I wasn't drueling over some picture perfect imaginary future or falling for lines old as time. He wasn't asking me to. But since I wasn't doing my usual naive cartwheels of joy, I knew something was missing. I couldn't adjust despite my own desires to. I wasn't happy cuz i was so busy thinking about what was wrong or would go wrong yatta yatta. I refused to let myself trust the relationship or any possible future. So that ended and I spent more time alone, and happy to be so, might I add.  Untill now anyways.  Now i'm alone and I don't want to be. I can be, I'm not afraid to be. I mean, couple events make me lonely kind of, but having a bf isn't gonna make me enjoy the concept of hanging with multiple friends and ignoring all but one.  I don't like couple things.  It's more the thought of having someone close to me.  All my best friends have their own partners to spend 24/7 with and tell all their secrets to.  I'd be happy with a best friend, I mean, I have that in Mandy some, but even there boys have taken over a few of my duties. so yeah, that's life i guess. Anyway I could deal with it, it's not like i just went eanie meanie miny mo, and picked a crush. The aj thing just kinda happened. And it's far from head over heals, I don't know how to explain it.  It just bugs me cuz I didn't decide it was time for it to happen or that he would be a logical person for me to like. I really don't know him at all. It's lame. Completely. But I'm around him and I feel like a middle school kid. I want to just tell him, take action of some sort and put myself in controll somehow. I feel like even screwing up and being disapointed would be better than complete helpless ignorance. Espescially watching Becca talk to him. She's awesome and really would be way better for him, if they're more than friends, which I wouldn't know, cuz I danno him! AH. But it's too early for me to say anything to him. One day, I'll explain all this, some how. If he's not taken by then heh. I'm just frustrated. I hate talking to him and wondering if maybe tara told him, even tho she said charlotte was on crack about the matchmaking thing. Or maybe he can just tell.  I hate talking to him and being giddy instead of focussing on friendship. I feel like I'm cheating both of us, in the same way that i used to handle my relationships. Bleh. Impatience.  In a kind of related note, I've been full of energy lately. Even something as simple as breathing is awesome, it's like i'm thirsty for air. I wanna be pretty, but more importantly I wanna be dancing, all the time. Music is bursting out of me. That's the only way I know how to explain it, I don't know if it makes any sense at all to anyone else. Anyway, I don't think that relates to aj, at least, aj doesn't cause that happiness, but it could be that happiness that causes my feelings for him. Who knows. I hate not knowing.  I do want a slow dance tho, with him. AHHHHHHHHHHHh. Ima have to tell him.  dang this drives me mad. toodles.
