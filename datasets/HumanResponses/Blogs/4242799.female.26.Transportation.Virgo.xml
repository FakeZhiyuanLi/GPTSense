       "This Child of God" is a poem that was written by my mother and I'm adding it on here because it sort of sums up how I've been feeling lately.  Here it is:      This Child of God      I thought today, as time went by,   The many times I've failed....it made me sigh.      Hills I thought were important to climb   Causing nothing, but more wasted time.      A relationship with one to heal this heart   Mislead through blinded eyes, tore us apart.      Another scar appeared on my soul   Falling down too many times takes its toll.      I'll stand once more and clear my view   Love comes so seldom...if I'd only knew.

       My first blog is basically for those females who are married and unhappy in their marriage.  Let me ask ya'll a question.  If you're so damn unhappy that you flirt with the guys at work, call them on the phone, sneak around to meet them in parks, at restaurants, etc....AND you get pissed off at the females who are single that talk to the men you want....why the hell do you stay married?  Yes, I am the single female that the married females at work are getting pissed off at.  There are 2 guys that I work with that I talk to.  Because I talk to these two gentlemen, there are 2 MARRIED.....females....at work that get pissed off at me every time they see me around these two gentlemen.  Why? Because married female A...we'll call her "Sue"....wants single guy A....whom we'll call "Paul".  Well, I'll tell you right now that "Paul" and I are close and we talk about everything.  "Paul" has feelings for me and understands that I need time to be single because of my coming out of a relationship not too long ago.  Well, hell, "Sue" can't stand that and shoots daggers in my back every time she sees us together.  As for single guy B....we'll call him "Ron"....I like him quite a bit.  Well....of course married female B...."Karen"....acts like she's got ants in her pants every time she knows that him and I have been talking or in the same friggin room together.  I know I'm venting and I apologize to ya'll...but my point is this....if you are married and you are unhappy in your marriage....DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE MARRIAGE!!!  And cheating on your spouse is not the solution I'm talking about.   Be a freaking woman and either be faithful enough to your husband to work it out with him or end the damn marriage.  If you choose to end the marriage...THEN...AND ONLY THEN....do you have the right to flirt, talk to, call, sneak around with whomever you choose.  I mean, come on people, what happened to the sanctity of marriage?  Why the hell get married if you're not done dating yet?  This is for the guys and the girls who are married and cheating on their spouse...GET SOME MORALS!!! People who cheat on their spouse make me sick and I have no respect for you.      Thanks for listening to me vent ya'll....I'll catch ya'll another day. :)
