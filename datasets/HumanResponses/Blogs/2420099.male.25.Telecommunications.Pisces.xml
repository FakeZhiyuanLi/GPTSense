      I love video games.  I've been playing Return to Castle Wolfenstein, but today I popped in some Madden and resumed my season.  Bam, Ahman Green rushes for three touchdowns!  THREE!  What a great game!   In about 10 minutes ESPN is going to have a retro basketball game on.  This should be interesting.  Besides the retro uniforms, the announcers will dress like it is the 70s and they will use the 1979 ESPN graphics for the game.  Sweet.

      Sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes you get really lucky.  First off, I got a great card from Jamie, thus permanently raising the bar of what is a great card.  All it says on the front is "high five".  Awesome.  Second, I got a pack of post it notes from 3M.  No explanation, they just showed up along with a coupon book.  Third, I got one of the free magazines I signed up for back in December.  Sweet.

      I know why my site is getting so many hits now!  It is from perverts looking for porn, or pr0n, by searching for "Morgan Webb Pics".  See, a while back I did a thing on how hot she was and included a pic of her, so Google being the good little engine it is logged that.  Now it shows up on some weird searches. In order to skew some more results, please ignore the following lines: porn, pr0n, sex, hot, girl, babe, model, nude,WWE, Yu-gi-oh, pokemon, NFL, NBA, baseball, germany, midgets, pi, MP3

      TWoP is the best spot to go if you have a favorite show that is a drama or reality show.  A few random quotes:    On The OC : The little lightbulb that goes on above Marissa’s head when she meets Natalie? Totally a 20 watt. Welcome to the plotline, Marissa.    On American Idol : Katie Schnozzola - Ooookay there, Screechy McVegas, I'd love to see you at about a five, and right now you've gone to eleven. There are dogs who got their eardrums blown out. And Phyllis Diller called - she wants her hair and her scary faces back.    On American Chopper : YIKES ! I was fearing for that poor baby when Paulie's girlfriend was touching her with those claw fingernails. Trim 'dem things girl !

      Tonights OC was great.  Nice to see that Oliver probably won't be around for a while, although the fact that we might not see much more Anna is a sad thing.  I really liked that girl.  :(  Maybe her and Luke can hook up?

      Dear KMTV.  I do not plan on watching your channel until you stop letting Travis Justice do political commentary on the evening news.  The 10:00 news feed is not the proper time or place for that.  You can let me know when it is ok to watch your network again by posting in the forums.  Thank you.

      For those of you familiar with my apartment, there is a door to the right when you first enter that is never spoken of.  Well I went through it, literally threw away half a dumpster (I'm not exaggerating either).  I took these pics before I was done loading it in, but all that is in the closet now: vacuums and broom Shoe hanger and ALL my shoes Hooters Bucket of shoe stuff (polishes, laces, what not) Gym bag Laundry supplies (Tide, Clorox, Bounce, what not) PSX Racing Wheel (Untill I make space on my gaming shelf) Clothes in storage Coats and cold weather clothing some stuff that belongs in the apartment that I don't use

      Well I get off of work to find out that they have changed 93.3 THE DAM to... get this... A COUNTRY STATION!!!  Bleh, now there is nothing to listen to on the radio.  Almost half is country now and the other half is that hip hop pop junk.  Blargh!  Gee... I could always listen to that one station with the two old farts that laugh at their lame, stupid, and not funny at all "jokes".  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go break something, or someone.

      Sharing your MP3s is illegal.  If you see something on my MP3 list and really gotta have it, check if it is copyrighted or not.  If it is public domain, such as an indy band that put it on mp3.com in order to get exposure, I have no problem if you IM me for it.  I believe in the free exchange of music when the artist wants it done.  If it is copywritten though, don't be cheap.  If you want it enough to ask some punk webmaster for it, you want it enough to buy it.  With CD prices coming down again, you can afford to buy your music again.  I reccomend going to your local music store instead of a chain, they will treat you better and take care of you as you buy more.  Oh, and if you are one of those people stealing MP3s and the RIAA busts you, I'm gonna laugh if there is any 'Barney - I Love You' on it.

      I'm pretty sure today must be Wednesday.  Anyway, I'd like to start with a huge shout out to anyone from the train that may be reading.  My mom and dad are so awesome.  Now everyone knows that I'm hard to shop for, unless you go on my Amazon list (love you Jamie!), so rather then buy me something, they paid my dry cleaning bill from last week, which included my heavy coat and ran around $35.  Love you mom and dad! Beavis is also awesome, besides taking me to the train station at an ungodly hour in the morning, she also taped Sopranos for me and is making me dinner on Sunday and we're going to watch last weeks and this weeks episode.  Love you Beavis! Big props to Becki, she picked me up at the train station, and hung out as my train was a little (hour) late.  Love you Becki! Of course Heather was a huge help with the Internet while we were out there.  Now I am able to research some things.  Love you Heather! Major thanks to TJ and his lovely wife Jennifer for the use of luggage for this trip.  I really should buy my own one of these days.  However, Jennifer has some really nice stuff.  I also used Rose's gym bag as a carry on. Ya know, I didn't think I would miss Omaha so much, but I did.  It's weird, I went away for just as long last fall but it didn't seem so long away from home.  I love Omaha. I really missed Melly too.  Nightly chit chat with her is awesome.  Steve and Cindy and Claye too! I have pictures and I'm going to start showcasing some of them on Yahoo, I'll link once they are available. I'll have a lot more commentary later, but I'm still settling back in.

My train left Denver on time and is expected to be ahead of schedule in reaching Chicago.  Cool.

      I am so looking forward to this trip.  Not just because it is NYC, and not just because of the train ride.  All that is icing on the cake, I get to see one of my best friends who I don't get to see very often!  That is the reason I'm willing to drop everything and venture East again.   A little of my plans: Leave town tomorrow morning at 6am *groan* on Amtrak number 6, the California Zephyr.  At 7:00pm I will board the Lakeshore Limited in Chicago.  From there it is overnight to Croton-Harmon.  Jamie luv, you best be on the platform playing like it is 1920 and you haven't seen me in ages!  :)   Saturday we are seeing 42nd Street.  I think it is in a theater on 42nd street, I'm not sure.  :)  For the weekend we also have tickets to the Empire State Building.  I also plan on getting a metro card wallet to put my work badge in.  Because I am a loser like that sometimes.   A few other trip notes.  I picked up some water and granola for the train ride today.  In Chicago one the layovers I plan on seeing one of the museums and the top of the Sears Tower.  My little digital camera is in for quite the workout.  I'm packing, and it looks like one suitcase and a carry on bag.  I'm trying to see how to lighten my load, if possible.  wish me luck.   Ok, so since this is like my longest Blogger entry ever...  I'm just rambling now...

      I realize there are many times I don't tell everyone everything and I assume I did, so here goes an attempt to bring everyone up to speed:   1) I am in the process of changing jobs at work.  I want to go back to school to become a network engineer and need to lower the stress levels in my life before I can do that.   2) I recently started working out at the new company gym.  I am doing a heavy cross-training schedule.   3) I meditate each night before I go to sleep.  Because I want to.   4) When most people dream of their future they see kids or marriage or what not.  I literally see money.  I want to have enough money to have my own place out in the middle of nowhere.  I don't need to be rich, just comfortable.  5) I have hypertension and keep it under control with medications.  Wanting off the meds is a key reason for Item 2.   6) I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea but refused treatment.  60% of all patients that begin treatment quit in the first year.  Many of the remainder don't use it properly.  It is difficult to find a mask for a stomach sleeper, not to mention the fact that every mask I tried on made me feel like I was choking.  This is a non-issue, meaning do not bring it up trying to be a good friend, it is a really easy way to upset me.   7) I have all but quit drinking.  It occured to me one day that it wasn't much fun and I was spending alot.  The only booze you will find in my apartment right now is a few bottles of beer.   8) I am extremely antisocial.  I don't like crowds.  I don't like being forced onto new people.  Most people know this, but it is always worth repeating.  There is a reason I have such a small circle of tight friends.  I prefer the company of Xbox Live over going to the club with 150 strangers all violating my personal space.   9) On a related note, I heavily value my personal space.  If you aren't one of my close friends, stay out of it.  There is nothing I hate more then being on an elevator because nobody respects personal space in there.   10) I am not a religious person.  It is not that I am an atheist or just a non-practicing christian.  I mean religion plays no part in my life as a presence or lack there of.

      I'm so tired of being here. Suppressed by all my childhood fears. And if you have to leave,  I wish that you would just leave. Cause your presence still lingers here, and it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal,  this pain is just too real, there's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears, When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years.  But you still have... All of me. You used to captivate me by your resonating mind, Now I'm bound by the life you left behind. Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams Your voice has chased away all the sanity in me. These wounds won't seem to heal,  this pain is just too real, there's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears, When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years.  But you still have... All of me. I tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone. But though you're still with me, I've been alone all along. When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears, When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years.  But you still have... All of me.

           I figure I owe an explanation to some people (Thanks for the heads up Mark!) on what happened with me and why I am not at the bank anymore.  Back in January, I had a chat with Kim and told her I was too stressed out and work and would like to post within the bank.  We eventually set an end date for my stay in Systems.      During the posting process, I decided to explore some options outside the bank.  I ended up at West working an insurance line group.  I am very happy with my newfound stress-free life, but have been considering some more options.  Once I am into the phase where I can play with my schedule, I am seriously considering going back to First National to work part time, possibly with Cardmember or Merchants, doing phone work.      Trust me, all is good.  Actually, all is great.  I have absolutely no stress whatsoever, and that is a phenominal feeling.  Also, a quick shout out to the Rats!

      MST3Claye: So.. Tuesday night Bongo and I were chatting away about Star Wars novels.. I went to a site he was talking about and then lost connection. I figured it was one of those dsl things where you wait a while and it'll return. So I played one of my games for a bit then went to bed. I was busy Wednesday so I didn't get a chance to check on it till I got home around 8:30 and there was a problem. I tried disconnecting the router.. and still no c   MST3Claye: the connection with the router was fine.. my brother and I were still connected.. So I figure it might be the modem.   MST3Claye: I did the usual turn off/unplug stuff and left it unplugged over night.   MST3Claye: yesterday I decided to call bellsouth about it.   MST3Claye: bellsouth told me with their automated voice that there was a network outage and that the estimated time of resolving it was not available.   MST3Claye: so about 1am last night I called and their menus had changed and I got connected with a REAL LIVE PERSON and they said it would be fixed around 2:30am...   MST3Claye: and I guess it was. :)

      In case anyone wondered about the software I use for the blog portion of bigmerl.com, it is called blogger.  They recently redid their main page and it is TIGHT.  Anyway, this software allows for multiple people to update the blog (As seen by the occasional posts by LCX and Rose) without installation of any software.  It works in conjunction with the  urlLink Google Toolbar  which I think is a needed tool for anyone using Internet Explorer.  Anyway, that is all I have right now, off to finish my book.

If anyone wants to add theirs, email it to me and I would be happy to post it.  10) MASH - The death of COlonel Blake   9)  South Park - the debut episode   8)  I Dream of Jeannie - The wedding   7)  Friends - Ross buys a new couch that doesn't fit up the stairs   6)  The O.C. - Anna leaves for Pittsburgh with the message "Confidence Cohen"   5)  Playmakers - Guerwitcz makes the pro-bowl and addresses the team on his homosexuality   4)  The Twilight Zone - It turns out "To Serve Man" is a cookbook   3)  Just Shoot Me - Mya meets Elliot's 'special' brother   2)  Beavis and Butthead - The debut of Cornholio   1)  The Sopranos - The death of Ralphie

      If anyone had noticed that I haven't been updating anything off the main page, there is a good explanation.  I had to format my PC and now I can't find my Office 2000 discs.  So it may be a while.  At least Blogger still works.  :)

      My Aunt Sandy was a wonderful woman.  I spent time with her growing up, she was a cool aunt, let us do things our mom wouldn't.  I do not think she had the ability to be mean, this world is a lesser place for having lost her.  Big love goes out to my cousins, especially PJ who has had a rough go of it lately.  I love you guys.

      By family, no I don't mean Tony B got whacked by Johnny Sach.  My Aunt Sandy passed away this past weekend.  It shook me up a little, funeral is on Wednesday.  My heart goes out to my uncle and cousins.

      As some of you may know, after my Amtrak trip I fell in love with train travel.  If you ever wondered where someone that wants to talk about train travel goes, wonder no longer.  Also, seek professional help.  That is all.

      I just realized it has been a while since I posted any original content to the site, so I figured I might as well.  Gotta fill the space next to the info box anyways thanks to my posting of that comic.  :) Lets see, I didn't win the Powerball, I did win the Who Wants to Be the Big Merl contest that was run last week though. I have been contemplating rearranging my apartment.  Partially because I want a love seat in my bedroom for when lounging around watching tv.  It's all good. Not a lot, life is pretty quiet lately.  Oh, and if you are visiting tonight, HI DON!

      BigMerl.Com is going under some MAJOR changes today.  First the bad news, I deleted the message boards and Star Wars sub webs.  Now the good news:   1) There are now comments pages for every post on the site.  On the summary line it says "comments", well if you click there you can add to the article someone already posted.  Of course, if you want to add articles to the main page,  urlLink just let me know .  2) There will be a revitilzation of the Front Page sections of the site too.  I haven't decided what yet, but there will be stuff.   3) I am adding some external links on the navigation bar to the left.  Expect cool things there.   4) More as I think of it.

      Big Merl is in a very weird mood today, listening to LIMP and just chilling at the Hoeliday Inn.  I'm thinking its the bottle of C2 I bought.  I'm afraid to open it if it is already having this effect on me.  :)   Looks like I'm gonna do  everything myself  (everything myself!) Maybe I could use some help but if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself! Maybe life is up and down, but my lifes been what till now? I crawled up your butt somehow and thats when things got turned around. I used to be alive (used to be alive), so pathetic but now I get it! What's done is done, I know, you just  leave it alone  and don't regret it!   But sometimes some things turn into dumb things and thats when you put your foot down! Why'd I have to go and meet somebody like you? Why'd you have to go and hurt somebody like me? How could you do somebody like that? Hope you know that I'm never coming back!   Depending on you is done! Giving to you is done! No more eating or sleeping or living it's just more giving to you and I'm done. Depending on you is done, and giving to you is done! No more eating or sleepig or living it's all just more giving to you and I'm done! The hiding from you is done! The lying to you is done! No more eating or sleepig or living it's all just more giving to you and I'm done! (and I'm done!)  ok, I'll kill the lyrics :)

      Have you always wanted to write for a top notch web site but were too lazy?  Now is your chance to write for a horrible site but with no deadlines.  The pay isn't too bad, if you don't insist on being paid, and the atmosphere is fun.  If you would like to be added to the bigmerl.com blogger account, just let me know.  The only request I have is please help keep it PG.  :)

      I recently reinstalled Diablo 2 and have started playing for the first time on patch 10.  To my suprise, when I get the cube I'm having trouble making potions.  Since I play a barbarian, you can bet that is alarming.  So I go and search the web, and find out that you now need gems to make potions.  Gee, thank you Blizzard for messing up the game. So now I am at a crossroads, my barbarian needs better potions to keep moving on, but the better potions are only going to come with tons of time killed running through the early acts looking for gem pieces to build the potions.  Makes a guy seriously consider cheating.

      I found another interesting Blog, this is an older blog that is still active, you don't see those too often.  A more intriguing template, works for her site but I don't think it would gel out for BigMerl.com.  I'm seriously thinking of changing templates again, I'm just not overly happy with mine right now. Anyways, I think this person likes to check their stats (I should check mine) so go ahead and click the link, lets see if my phantom visitors (feel free to comment whenever folks1!) can have some sort of /. effect on her stats.  >:)

      OK, so this update isn't all that super, so sue me, but I felt like calling it super.  It's all good.  :)   Hi Lindsey!  I had a dream that I kept getting mail from Yahoo!, this morning I checked my email and the post notification had all your posts on it.  So I can now account for at least one thing from my bizarre dreaming last night.  :)  I linked you on the right side of my blog, since I saw you had done the same.  RIP Rick James, he's dead *****!  I have found the meaning of life.  Yea, ham.  NO NOT HAM YOU FAT ****!  It is sleep.  Sleep is the reason we are all here.  You ever find an obscure MP3 and years later have it come up on your playlist, and you wonder whatever happened to those guys?  I burnt a new CD for my alarm clock, I now wake every morning to Limp Bizkit - Rollin (Urban Assault Vehicle), Stevel surrenders ninja style  I haven't linked them in a while, so visit  urlLink FARK !  Ruben Bear is watching the AMA Motocross series right now, so he can't pose for any pics, sorry Mel  LCX = NEEDS TO GET RAINBOW SIX THREE  You ever notice that they call them bullets, but they look more like dots?  SWEET!  Deano Martin just popped up on WinAMP!  I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  I knew a man Bo Jangles and he danced for me  Sometimes when we touch the honestys too much  I want to **** you like an animal  One of those four lyrics is not like the other...  *clap clap clap* WE LOVE OUR JOB *gag*  I'm gonna go play Xbox.
