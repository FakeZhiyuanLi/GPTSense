      Love. I say this single word and then my entire mind goes blank As if through all the experiences in my life this is my conclusion. Then what am i living for if it is truely nothing To saythat my goal in life doesnt exist is to say my existence means nothing Maybe this is so for my blank mind cannot conjure even so much as a theory anymore Maybe every conjured thought was mearly a thread of hope; and slowly as time passed each thread desipated until i was left in complete dispair

      This is something I must say, Not only because I have been forced to say it, But because it needs to be said, Except, I really don’t know how to, Anyone can say sorry because it is just another word, No one knows whether you really mean it, I believe it is beyond human affection to truly be sorry. I have lost my humanity, Or rather I have lost myself in a shadow, What I am seems only false, artificial. I try to become what it is I wish to achieve, But I only succeed in being that which I condemn, It is a powerful entity, which takes hold of me, I am not human, only an animal, Craving only what an animal yearns, I am afraid of everything when there is nothing, I am an animal in the dark incapable of rest, Forever looking over my shoulder. I am an animal and nothing more, I cannot say I am sorry because I can never truly mean it, I can only sit in remorse, It is beyond me how one can say I am sorry and be accepted, To show you that I care I will not say these false words, What is done is done and it may happen again, But I promise to try harder that much I can do, This is not beyond my rationality or showing that I care, It is all I can offer you.

      Have you ever noticed how a sad man only is happy when he is sad? He must always be around the desperate and deranged, And then he must always be the worst of them, He competes with others to see witch is more pitiable, Then he refuses pity, He refuses partly because he does not deserve it, For his mistakes and misfortunes are his doing, But he also does not know how to receive it, It is a gift that is either not wanted or desperately needed, A sad man refuses pity because he does not know how to give it, It is truly an elusive gift and yet it is also a powerful scorn.

      The walls that once stood strongly by my side have collapsed, I catch myself about to cry in the open and stifle my tears, In the darkness I can think and weep undisturbed, Oh, I have done terrible things, Things I should ought not done, I have taken so much and hurt so many. What am I good for if I am but human, I am afraid of my own truths that keep shelter deep in my mind, Some lay so deep that they are utterly forgotten, Yet some are so terrible that they can never be so, I would to find a way to end this misery, Such a sweet thing as an end should never be so to me, For as all things even mercy shall abandon me, And I shall be here drowned among my truths, banished in selfishness.

      I often wonder about with nothing but a song in my head, Something soothing something sad, I don’t know why it is so hard to be happy, To enjoy the things I have, My life is an ever waking nightmare both too horrible and too explicit to explain, I cannot sleep for when my eyes close I am haunted by my own demons, Each seems to be created for a purpose, So I lay awake in a daze of what my dreams should be, But only so long as my eyes are open, Even then it is as if they are taunting me, Showing me glimpses of my nightmares as I blink my eyes, In these times my emotions fly not really in a particular direct, but every which way And reign free upon the shallow gravely memories that my mind tries so hard to forget, For my mind in its turmoil whips like a hurricane, Tearing at my emotions and every shred of my humanity, Yet to others I am happy always smiling without ever a frown on my horizon,  But that is not who I am, For who I am is beyond even my comprehension, For I know that I am the child who cries himself to sleep, Then cries in his dreams.

      My heart folds in and hides from the world, Keeping its fresh wound from curious eyes, Though I know they know its there, I hold my head up and move strong never allowing any doubt of my true emotions, But I cry in my pillow wishing for so much, To have another life and yet maintain my own, To try and live more then one life is to stretch yourself to thin, But just because something is wrong doesn’t mean you don’t do it, I do bad things things knowingly and openly, I stretch myself thinner and thinner, I live for everyone else but myself and what does that bring me?

      Ill go with you if that’s what you think I should do, I promise not to get in the way, If I could do the things I know you could, I know you would let me stay, But I am too small to do most things, And to big to run away.

      It is remarkable isn’t it? How we can say something new every day, To see constant change that seems incapable of repeating its self, We see the same things but never in the same way, Always there is change, With everyday a new sunrise, With every story a different version, With every person a different face, It is remarkable isn’t it? My life is just starting and every day is a new beginning.

      He did not see the dark storm, He did not see the great clouds, Flowing like an endless wave, He did not see the rain turned violent by the wind, The storm reached down, Ripping and tearing at every living thing, Standing there afraid, He did not see the dark storm, He only saw the lightning, He only heard the thunder.

      I fell one day and kept on falling,  In what was a short forever, Blind were my thoughts, Yet my thoughts were clearer, All at once I was gone, Yet all at once i was still present, My life a short forever.

      I think I’m falling in love, It’s strange to say I feel something knew, For I have never felt so before doesn’t make it strange, It was coming this I knew, And what feels like bliss will turn to a straggling pain, Knowing all this and still striving makes all of this strange.

      Do not speak to me of love, It is a word to strong to have ever existed, Boundless in its quantity, Do not speak to me of love, For I do not believe it exists, It is the illusion of wanting, Do not speak to me of love, I have searched for her and she hid, When I reached she moved away, And when I was utterly without wanting, She came.

      I feel very sad and completely lost, For the cold drafty winds of the sky beat down upon me with its tears, I feel very sad and completely alone for I forgot the things I do in the rain, For the rain beating down shows no relent in its down- pour of sorrow, I sit at my window and wonder about things, Things in which I could do if the sun rose high in the sky, If the wind stopped and life was at every sight to be seen, Where there is now darkness there would be light, I embrace my warm memories and let them sweep me into the abyss of my dreams, Then I awake to the never wading present, I sigh and continue gazing from my window, I cry letting my tears join that of the rain and wallow in grief These are the things I do in the rain.

      Assurance has abandoned me and left me without hope, Depression is the blood that flows freely, I know where I am and do not care, I am alone with no indentation of what I will become, I fell deprived of all emotions except fear and expectance.

      Tears hurt, I never asked them to, I never wanted to cry in the first place, Still I cry with endless relent, I often wonder were I am, Do I have to do the things I do? I know that I never say things at the right time, I say things I should never say, When I look at the bad things I’ve done, When I look at the things that have been said, It doesn’t feel so bad to cry, Tears come and I am not ashamed, So still I cry.

      I long for someone,  I wait in the wonder of finding what I never had, It hurts to know what I want will end, It hurts to know I never had it, My hurt is the longing of companionship, It will not hurt to stand-alone and wait, To wait in the cold of winter, To wait in the heat of summer, To wait in nothingness as love shows its face.

      Calmness whispers its sorrow, I listen in pity, Knowing all to well the broken serenity, Calmness turns to stillness, And stillness to oblivion, The bliss of oblivion is simplicity, That simplicity burns into me like a brand, And the calmness‘ broken peace becomes my own, How now I wish to go into oblivion, And so calmness pities me…

      My kitten is a cute ball of fuzz, The only one I trust with my secrets. My kitten will never grow up, She will give me the same puzzled look; the same playful loving  purr.  I love my kitten more than the day, Her eyes so innocent and awe&nbsp;inspiring. I live for her  purr  and her company, The satsifaction of simply being with her. When she lays on my leg and rest, i rest. These moments are like candy to me. Nothing can ever go wrong when im with  my kitten; and I will be with her forever.

      I enjoy dreaming and so as my gift to you, I shall offer my dream: We are sitting alone in the quiet of the woods, I have you in my arms as you have me in yours. We talk but only to ourselves, As if to whisper and hide a secret from the trees, And sometimes we don’t even talk… Just sit and enjoy each others warmth. I could never dream as sweet a dream as I did. And I will dream it again some night,And maybe you can come with me so that we could sit together.

      I am bound to this world, Chained somewhere near life, I cannot die for my will shall not commit it,  I am bound to this world, I have been here for the entirety of my existence, Life never seems to change, The lost have no place to go so they remain lost,  I am bound to this world, Every scar upon my body is another moment past, Every motion I make is pointless, Every reality eludes me,  Forever am I chained here between compassion and sin… Here between life and death, I cannot tell which one comes easier, I cannot see what path I have chosen,I do not know if I have even chosen a path.

      There is a thought in my head I cannot seem to get out It haunts me just below my own surface then ducks away where I can’t find it I feel a stranger to my own mind But this cannot be for to think at all I must have possession of some of my mind Perhaps I have two minds. One which thinks and the other tease’s it. However crazy this may be it is how this part of me thinks Call me strange if you wish or even deranged but it cannot erase these things I feel I will always think this way That I know that much more about myself than anyone else Yet still a stranger to my own mind

      Maybe I should just stay home. There isn’t much need for me to go anywhere And I am perfectly content right here. I guess I should go to the store But that can wait. There is no need to rush. I will go tomorrow perhaps, yes tomorrow.  I wonder how my friends are doing. Well I’m sure there doing fine, but Perhaps I should call. No they are all busy and about here and there, They do not need me pestering them. But still, perhaps I should call I have not talked to them in so long and they May worry. Perhaps tomorrow. Yes tomorrow I shall.  I have missed so much being confined to my home. For an endless time I have been tied to this chair. My cabinets are bare, There rich mahogany has become pale as though It has seen the last of its days. Oh! My friends, they Have fled and gone but to where I do not know. I should search for them. But I fear to leave the Comfort of my chair, the Hallow of my home. Perhaps tomorrow… yes tomorrow I shall. I have waited for my tomorrow and it has not come, But perhaps tomorrow.

      A child looks at himself and denies only what is not obvious, They are blind to the world and yearn for the warmth of another, They do not understand the importance of anything known to mystery, They know the unknown knows what can only be called mystery, Still is it mystery if anyone knows? Is this not the reason in which to keep things secret? To protect those that know enough…

      I once made myself to believe I didn’t exist, In that moment I did not, For at that moment my heart grew cold, My breath grew shallow, My body abandoned, And I was lost to myself,Adrift in an all too crowded river.

      I awoke one day to a silver moon, Its glow was as warm as the sun, As I stare out into the vastness of my mind, I am mesmerized by a single rose silhouetted by the moon, Its simplistic protrusion allured me, And as I drew near to it I become oblivious, Oblivious as I sank into its warmth, Oblivious when all was quiet and perfect, Oblivious, alone with my rose, And as I awoke I thought what is more perfect then a dream.

      I hold my rose close to me, For I like nothing more then to bask in her beauty, I stroke her petals for hours, As if in that next moment she might disappear, I stay a year by her side in silence, So I may hear her voice as the only precious sound in my mind, To look into her eyes is to glimpse the whole of heaven, For this is how I love you.

      Isn’t it amazing that after an eternity of history we can still say something new, That we may go out and see things that no one else has ever seen, To be capable of things that we were never able to do, But what happens when we have done everything? What happens when we wake up to a world that cannot change? A world that is without new emotion and without charisma, What happens if there is no world and everyday is a waking nightmare?

      i am afloat, adrift in the pool of compassion, i dream sweat dreams of a future that evades me, a stillness grows in me, it is the fear of what is never to come, to have not life cut short but to never fulfill my life, my dreams turn to nightmares, and i wish for absolute stillness to come over me, to awake to a new hope, those sweet dreams of my future evade me, adrift in a pool of compassion.

      I had a love once, though i forgot her name, I never thought a name to be important, I will never forget her though, She smelled of cedar, Her hair was a dark sky, Oh i had a love once, Though i forgot her name, Her skin as soft and smooth, Her chin stood straight and her shoulders thin, Her eyes were dangerous,like that of a hunting animal, Oh yes this was my love that i remember, I had a love once, though i forget her name.

      You are the rose,The definition of beauty,Soft and firm each pedal stands,your lips the softest of pedals which my lips strive to touch,every thorn an obstical which pales to your radiance,you are the rose never to be had,always within the brush,forever out of my reach.
