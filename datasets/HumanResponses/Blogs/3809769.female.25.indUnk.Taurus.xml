						   Put your arms around me just one more time and never let me go... In a world of their own by just a gentle touch he stimulates her entire body & soul by just a look a conversation of a thousand words by just a smile a life time of happiness  a kiss that can melt a thousand frozen lakes and set off a million volcanoes day to day wishing not to live one with out him by my side when I feel alone just a touch of a finger I feel whole again with just that touch, I have experienced true love making with just that touch, that smile, that look  with just him I feel complete

						   She lays awake at night as he runs through her mind. She lived in this world of make believe but he pulled her out and showed her reality, reality that she was terrified to face but now know there was nothing to fear, she asks him ,"Now can I show you my world? It's a place with no lies, no fear, no hurt." it's a place that she has control over who comes in. She allowed no one in ever in her world. She realized he must go there, when she looked in his eyes. In her mind she brought them both there, and when they returned, she gives him a  look ... A look only she knows, a look of the make believe world... soon he will understand all eyes..

						   Looking in his eyes, feeling the comfort never thought. Comfort not to look around, but only in his eyes. If he's not around she closes her eyes and imagine his.  he raises his eye brow with confusion she gave him with just a look, confusion she loves to see. at night when she lays to sleep, she hold her blanket and imagine it was him, closes her eyes and imagine his, hears a sound and imagine it was him. a world of imagination she lives when he is not around, but when he returns, his eyes she sees and comfort she feels....

						   did you follow me home tonight? will you be knocking on my door in the morning? will I be held in your arms again? will I ever feel that love again? that feeling that was, oh so intense!! will you return where you belong?!!!! you belong with me!! not to sound crazy. but if I feel so empty with you not here, then I believe this is where you should stand!! I'll wait if you want. but I'll never give up. you have one life and the only thing you have control of is your happiness, so why not conquer? i need to move forward but i need to know, will it be you thats stand by me? or do i dream to much? i always knew you were a dream.  i just wish i could go back to sleep.... my soul is burning with my memories of you,  how can such a small part of your life hurt for so long? why is it that i feel as though i still need. i think i needed you before i meet you. how did i let you go why did i ?????
