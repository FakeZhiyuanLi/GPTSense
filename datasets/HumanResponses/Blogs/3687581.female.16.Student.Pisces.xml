      Salamat sa kung sino mang ngbabasa nito ngyn...  pg tungkol to sa iba't ibang ka-ek ekan ng  buhay, natural, wel, at least mdalas, binabasa  tlga natin, db?? tulad ng LOVE!? mdami sa 'tin  dyan, in love sa "LOVE" itself.. o d kya  sa "FRIENDSHIP", may mga interesado rin d2, dhl  besides their family, friends agad ang next..  may iba nmn, pg "SEX" ang pinaguusapan, ayun..  ngsisimula na.. pro pag ssbhn kong  this message is about GOD, babasahin mo ba to?  Malamang hindi. Baka nga i-close mo to agad eh!  tama ba ko? Pero kapag sa ibang bagay may  panahon tayo noh? Kapag Siya na, OOOPPSSS, SORRY  GOD, IM KINDA BUSY! busy with what? Chatting,  malling, texting, PC Games, beauty rest,  watching et cetera et cetera! Lagi namang ganon  eh no? Minsan sasabihin pa, eh sayang ang oras,  mahal mag-internet...bakit ko pa pag-aaksayahan  ng panahon to e nagsisimba naman ako tsaka  nagdadasal naman ako minsan e! pwede na yon!  HINDI SAPAT YON! nagsisimba ka nga, pero bago ka  mapilit ng parentz mo, pahirapan! nagdadasal  nga, pero halos paulit-ulit ang sinasabi natin  gabi-gabi! Laging LORD SANA ganito ganon Lord  tulungan mo ko! Lord Favor...wag na kayong  tumanggi, ganyan di ako noon. LIFE IS NOT ABOUT  HAVING FUN! LIFE IS NOT ABOUT YOU OR ME! Ang  buhay ay puno ng problema! At dapat tayong  magpasalamat sa mga problema na yon, kasi kapag  may problema lang naman tayo nakakalapit sa  Diyos eh, tama ba? Nung Sunday, tahimik ka sa  church..hindi nakikipag-usap sa katabi...kumbaga  well-behaved...pero itanong mo nga sa sa sarili  mo kung naintindihan mo yung sermon ng Pastor!  HINDI MO ALAM NO? e syempre, tahimik ka nga at  nasa simbahan ka nga, PERO LUMILIPAD ANG UTAK  MO! kung ano-anong iniisip mo...anong kakainin  ko mamaya, saan ako pupunta, sino na kayang  tumatawag at nagtetext sa fone ko? sagutin kaya  ako ng nililigawan ko at marami pang iba! Sayang  yung chance na nakausap na sana natin ang Diyos.  Simula ng ipanganak ka, nasabi mo bang  nakapaglingkod ka na sa Diyos? naiparamdam mo na  ba sa Kanya na mahal mo Siya? Hindi pa cguro!  pero kapag sa mga GILFRIEND at BOYFRIEND gagawin  natin lahat masabi lang natin kung gano natin  sila kamahal. Nasa kanila lahat ng oras natin,  but kapag kay Jesus, kahit 1 minute wala. Try  nyo kayang bawasan miski 30 minutes lang ang  panonood ng tv and makipag-usap kay God or  basahin ang Bible... Di ba kayo kapag hindi kayo  pinansin ng taong mahal nyo kahit lahat na ng  bagay ginawa nyo, MASASAKTAN KAYO? ganon din ang  DIYOS. kasi binabalewala natin sya eh!  Ipinanganak tayo para MAHALIN SIYA! WE ARE BORN  FOR GOD'S PLEASURE. WE ARE BORN FOR HIS PURPOSE.  WE ARE BORN NOT TO BE SERVED BUT TO SERVE.  Siguro itatanong niyo: sino ka ba para sermonan  kami at para magsalita ng ganyan. Kristiyano ako  at ginagawa ko lang ang purpose ko. Dati, hindi  ako religious,tamad magsimba at paulit-ulit lang  ang prayers ko, pero gusto kong makabawi kay  God. May panahon pa para magbago. Ang dami ko pa  sanang gustong sabihin,kaso kulang sa space. Try  nyo nalang basahin yung book na "THE PURPOSE- DRIVEN LIFE" at baka sakaling maintindihan nyo  yung mga sinabi ko. SANA mabuksan na ang isipan  nyo.

      Lady: Why do you like me..?  Why do you love me?   Man: I can't tell the reason.. but I really like  you..   Lady: You can't even tell me the reason...  How can you say you like me?  How can you say you love me?   Man: I really don't know the reason, but I can  prove that I love you.   Lady: Proof? No! I want you to tell me the  reason. My friend's boyfriend can tell her why  he loves her but not you!   Man: Ok ok!!! Erm... because you're beautiful,  because your voice is sweet,  because you are caring, because you are loving,  because you are thoughtful, because of your  smile, because of your every movements..   Unfortunately, a few days later, the Lady met  with an accident and became a vegetable. The Guy  then placed a letter by her side, and here is  the content:   Dearest,   Because of your sweet voice that I love you...  Now can you talk? No! Therefore I cannot love  you. Because of your care and concern that I  like you.. Now that you cannot show them,  therefore I cannot love you. Because of your  smile, because of your every movements that I  love you..  Now can you smile? Now can you move?  No, therefore I cannot love you...  If love needs a reason, like now,  there is no reason for me to love you anymore.  But does love need a reason?  I still love you... Because love doesn't need  one...

      Message:  A girl asked a guy if he thought she  was  pretty,   he said...no...   She asked him if he would want to be with her  forever....and he said no...  She then asked him if she were to leave would he  cry, and once again he replied with a no...   She had heard enough.   As she walked away, tears streaming down her  face the boy grabbed her arm, and said....  You're not pretty...you're beautiful... I don't want to be with you forever...i need to  be with you forever...  And I wouldnt cry if you walked away...I'd die...

      I once loved someone who loved me back. But he didn't want to stay ... so I had to let him go.   I cried. A lot. I spent countless nights  wondering what went wrong, muffling my sobs with my pillows so my parents wouldn't suspect that something’s amiss.. I'd reminisce about our happy times, then break down when I realize that he’s no longer mine.. I analyzed every single  detail of our breakup.. I wrote long e-mails to my closest friends. I talked endlessly about my situation.. I spent my nights in tearful telephone conversations and my days in daydreams where we'd end up in each other's arms again..   Sometimes he’s still my angel, still my knight in shining armor who I'd do anything for just to have back. But sometimes, I see him as the devil incarnate who broke my heart in the worst  possible way, and who deserved to be horsewhipped at the very least.   I told myself that it was all for the better. That this is what’s best for the both of us. That this is God's plan. My friends offered similar advice, none of which I hadn't heard before: "It's a sign that you're not meant for each other," "When God closes a door, He opens a  window," "Someone better is coming for  you," "There are so many other fish in the sea,"  etc..   But it didn't work. Because deep down, I still believed that he is the one, the only one. And I couldn't understand how this is all for the better ... when everyday seemed more torturous than the last ... not being able to be with him the way I wanted to be, seeing him so  unaffected, and dealing with my broken-and- smashed heart and my bruised ego.   I tried to immerse myself in other activities to forget about him. I went out a lot and tire myself to sleep. I filled my schedule with T.V. and movie marathons, shopping sprees, and Music  Maniax. It worked for a while ... but then there were times ? times when my mind was cleared of the busy thoughts, I tried to occupy it with ? that I would think of him. His memory would sneak up to me on tiptoes, catching me in my  most vulnerable moments.   I tried to show the world that I am OK.. that I am over him.. that it was fine just being friends. I didn't go around with a big "X" on my forehead, nor did I go around with puffy eyes and tissue box. I tried to live my life as I knew it before I met him. People thought that I  was doing great.   They heard me laugh and they saw me smile; I seemed happy, they said; and I told myself that I am. But in the solace of my room, where I tried to organize my thoughts and sort out my feelings, I had to admit to myself that I am not truly happy. Because I am still yearning for  someone, and my heart still ached for something that could not be.   It's been over a month now since we broke up.. Surprisingly, things have gotten better. I've changed. Somewhere along the way, I realized that he’s not the only one out there for me. I also realized that there were valid, powerful reasons why we split up.. And I' ve become stronger, older, wiser.   He's changed as well -- when I look at him, sometimes I still see the boy I fell in love with. Sometimes I think that he's the same person ... he still has the same goofy smile and mischievous charm that I fell for, and I like to believe that the rest of him is unchanged as well. But then I take a closer look and I realize that he HAS changed ... that I don't know him anymore, not really ... not enough to  love and care for him as I once did.

      Kakauwi ko lang from school. Pag uwi sobrang  pagod. Binaba ko bag ko at nahiga sa sofa. Sarap  ng pakiramdam ng mapahinga. Matagal akong  nakahiga nang di ko namalayan na nakakatulog na  pala ko. Biglang nagvibrate ang celfon ko. I  checked kung sino. I opened my inbox---   “misan akala mo nasasayo na ang lahat pagnasayo na ang taong mahal mo. Pro lahat na nga ba? Gano ka kasigurado na iyo na sya Habang buhay? Kaya ngyn plng alagaan m n Habang nandyan pa!” Sender: BaBy koW  It’s a usual quote coming from my  girlfriend. Dahil sa antok ko, di ko na  nireplyan. Again my cell vibrated. 1 message  received--- “nVr hold in2 smtnG too TyT.. Cz smWer N d MiddLe U MyT Lus heR. Dnt put UrseLf in2 smTng U knW U cnT Let Go..” Sender: BaBy koW  naku naman pagod na pagod ako so tinuloy  ko na ang pagtulog ko. Hindi ko na maintindihan  ang sense ng message niya dahil sa antok so pano  pa ko magrereply? Again nagvibrate nanaman pero  di ko n pinansin pro ayan nanaman. 2 messages  received--- First message: “I jst wnt u to knw dt I love u&evn God takes me away from you It wont change.You own my heart Till d very last breath il take.” Sender: BaBy koW  Pinatay ko na ang cell ko ng hindi  binabasa ang isa pang message. Kaya natulog na  lang ako ulit. Paggising ko wala na kong battery  so I charged my cell and I tried calling her  with my landline. I tried 5x kakatawag pero wala  talagang sumasagot. After 30 minutes my landline  rang. Sister ni Maila(baby kow), so I asked her  “bakit walang tao sa bahay niyo?” Di siya sumagot.Umiiyak siya. So I asked: “bakit? Ano nangyari?” Biglang may naghello, ang dad nila ni Maila  pala, so I asked “Tito ano po nangyayari?”  Sinabi niya sakin ng walang pagaalinlangan---  “Umalis kami nanood kami ng sine. Nagpaiwan si  Maila dahil ang sabi niya pupunta ka daw dito sa  bahay. Hihintayin ka daw niya. Dahil sa sinabi  niya iniwan namin siya…..”  Nagulat ako sa sinabi ni tito. Ngayon ko lang  naalala na pupuntahan ko nga pala siya. Hindi  ako nakapagsalita dahil bigla na akong kinabahan.  Tinuloy ni tito ang pagsasalita---  “pagdating namin nakita nalang namin siya na  patay na. Sinaksak siya ng mga nanloob sa bahay  namin. Wala na siya.”  Nagblanko ang paningin ko pati na rin ang  pagiisip ko.  “Di ka kasi pumunta. Inuna mo ang kung anoanong  mga bagay.Di mo man lang siya naisip.”  Di ko alam kung sino ang nagsasalita konsensya  ko ba to o ang daddy niya?! Do ko na alam ang  nangyayari sakin.  P******** nawala na sakin ang mahal ko!!!!  Di ko alam kung sa anong dahilan pero binuksan  ko ang cellphone ko na 5 oras na plang nakacharge.  Ang message nya na hindi ko binasa nandun pa  rin. Hindi ko alam kung bubuksan ko pa o hindi but  still binuksan ko na rin---  “B TULNGAN M KO PAPATAYN NLA KO!!!”  Sender: BaBy koW  Di ako makapunta sa bahay nila dahil sa hiya. Di  ko man lang madalaw siya dahil di ko matanggap  sa sarili ko na makikta ko siyang nakahiga na. Di  ko maisip na wala na ang taong pinakamamahal ko. Di  ko matanggap na ng dahil sakin kaya nagkaganon  siya. Ano pang silbi ng mga sinabi ko skanya  noon na hindinghindi ko siya iiwan…… Na hindi ko siya pababayaan.. na hingding hindi siya magiisa... Ano na nangyari sa mga sinabi ko sakanya??... Wala na siya… Wala na ang taong bumuo ng buhay ko… Wala na….

      If you smile at them, they think pa-cute ka; If you don’t naman, sasabihan kang suplada If you respond love agad, thy think you’re easy to get If it took years to decide, sobrang kang pa hard-to-get If you go out with himm alone, sasabihan kang liberated Kapag may chaperon along, badtrip kasi ma-didisturb If you go out with him alone, tingin sayo playgirl; Pag sick ka sa kanya, they’ll proclaim youre dead na dead If you ask him where his been, sasabihan kang over-protective Pag pinabayaan mo naman, they’ll think you’re fooling lang If you let him kiss you, he thinks you’re cheap If you refuse naman, he’ll go and find another chick… Girls are just humans and makes mistakes din, And we often wonder, Ba’t ANG LABO NINYO MEN?!
