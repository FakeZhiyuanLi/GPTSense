      I won't be writing for the next few days. I am leaving to go my friends cottage tomorrow and won't be back until Sunday some time. Then on Monday I am going to my grand parents for about a week. I do not know If I will get a chance to write there or not. I am looking at this msn group called Ask A Witch Community. The title of this post is a link to the webpage if you want to visit it. I joined, it seems good so far. I am waiting for someone to book the chat room for a wicca class. Not that I really need it, but I would like to see what it's like, I have never talked to another wiccan over the internet, or get taught a lesson by someone else. I might learn something to, wich would be cool. I always taught my self by trial and error. I really would like to open my own wicca/pagan website, maybe on geocities or something. Maybe one day, maybe not. I really do wish I knew of other wiccans/pagans. I have never met a pagan, and I have only spoken to a few other wiccans. I hope, one day when I have children, they will take to paganism or wicca. I would never push them to. It really is a lovely way to live. Less stress because your mind is more open, and developed to deal with things, and figure ways out of problems. It is hard to explain. I will try to write on Sunday if I can, but I do not know what time I will be getting home, and I leave early Monday morning, but I will try.

         This is my first time posting anything, so let me explain why I named this blog Me,my self and I. I named it this because, that is often how I feel. I feel like I am split up into more than one person. I often have conversations with myself. I take a walk and go sit by the lake, and I ask myself questions. It is almost like I am asking my deeper thought for advice, and it answers. I am now 13, and have been doing this for quite some time.

   There was times when I was much younger, like 8 and 9 when I did this a lot. I use to talk to my stuffed animals and pretend they answered me when I needed guidance. Then when I got about 10 I stopped talking to my stuffed animals and started talking to myself. All along it was me who was answering the questions, not the stuffies and when I got to be about 10 I understood that. Then, there was about 1 1/2 years of my life that I stopped.

   I stopped because I was getting older and you would here people say that if you talked to your self you were crazy and I felt stupid for doing, even though I didn't talk outloud to myself. So I blocked my inner thoughts out for about a year and a half. 

   It wasn't until I moved that I started again. I was about 12 and 3 quarters old, almost 13 when we moved. We moved to a farm, I have always lived on a farm so I loved it. But the time we moved was the last week of school before summer break, so I never got a chance to make any friends for the summer. 

   I spent that whole summer alone. It drove my crazy and I was so bored, I had always lived just outside of the city, so I was always walking to someone else's house, but here, it was about a 2 hour walk to town. That's when I started hearing things, almost like a small voice in my head. It was quite, and I would shut it out and continue to think of something to do. Then, I took a walk to the lake and that is when the voice got loud, and consistent. I didn't even care what it was saying just to get it out of my head, because people would think I was nuts. But then, I listened to it. I listened and it gave me ideas for things to do. I wasn't bored anymore, I had constant ideas and inspiration flowing through my head.

   To this day, I spend a lot of time, laying on my bed with my music turned on low. I run every thing through my head that happened during the day. Sometimes I will get in bed at 9 and start thinking and asking my inner self for guidance, and as soon as nothing else is coming to mind, I don't push for things to come to me, so I will stop to go to bed and it is 12! I can't believe I spent all that time thinking. I almost totally block out the world. I do not hear or see anything but what I am thinking in my mind. I do it at school sometimes. I will get into deep thought and the teacher gets mad because I just stare at something, and don't do my work. 

   I think my inner spirit is very strong, because of me doing this every night almost. But again, I never push for it to happen, or stay longer. One, because it doesn't work, and two because it gives my a head ache. It always comes to me when I need to make a sudden important decision. It also keeps track of things I do. I will be running things through my head and remembers something good I did, or something not so nice I did, and remember not to, or to do it again.

   I think it could do everyone some good if they exercised there inner mind more, wiccan, pagan and all.

      I am so glad to be back home. I feel kind of bad about disliking it so much there, at my grandparents I mean. They are just such different people than me, it is hard to know we are related. I live on a horse farm, love working hard and having fun at it, and I love being outside. We have 95 acres of land, mostly forest and hay fields so I am outside a lot. They, live in a suburb, terrified of horses, think that trees and rivers are to be looked at from a distance only and hate doing anything that might get you dirty. I went mainly because my grandmother is in the hospital being treated for lung cancer, 2nd time and it is really hard for my grandfather to be alone all day, cook, clean and run 2 jobs, his own and my grandmothers. I think he really enjoyed having someone to talk to, and I learned how to cook all different kinds of food (by trial and error!). It was different, but not my style of living. I will most likely go back before my summer break is over, to help out. While I was there, in ste-agathe that is, I met a very nice man on the train. He was obveously wiccan, he was wearing crystals and a silver pentagram around his neck, so I brought up the subject of wicca. We had a nice conversation about it, I told him what I though about it, and he told me what he thought about it. I think he is one of the braver wiccans, I would never wear a pentagram that was visible. I would be teased so badly and sent to the office at school for  disturbing the peace' . I would much rather laylow about it, just my point of view. I hate it when people start calling you a devil worshipper, and a Satanist. They are obveously totally ignorant to anything about wicca. I saw a quote on a wiccan website that said people that say wiccans are devil worshippers should be told by the wiccan, "I think I'd know if I was worshipping a divinity from another religion." I could not explain how I feel about it any better. It just gets on my nerves so much. My stepfather is like a 3yr old. He always thinks he is right. We had an argument about the word stag. My stepfather said that stag was not a male deer, and I said it was. After arguing about it for a while, I got the dictionary and looked it up. One of the definitions for stag, was male deer. I showed him and he still said it wasn't! Like the book is wrong. That was about a year ago. I have now learned that you might think the person who always thinks they are right is an idiot, but you are an idiot for arguing with them. Wow, I wrote a lot today. I guess I was making up for the short post the other day! Well must go not, I think Wayne and Pat are home, bye!

      I am at my grandparents, and wish I wasn't. Not that I don't like them, just they are very different than I am. I am going home tomorrow though. I miss Pat the most, he is so cool. Well I don't feel like writing much right now, I am going to bed, later.
