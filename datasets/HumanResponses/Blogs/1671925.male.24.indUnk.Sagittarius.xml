       urlLink Multicasting  is the ability to transmit a single stream to multiple subscribers at the same time. It does not need one stream per recipient, instead, there is one stream on any one segment of the network on which there is a subscriber. It is the task of the routers to track subscriptions and to create copies only on an as-needed basis.  Segments on which there are no subscribers do not receive the stream.

      I read something interesting today.  "Bush is the Devil himself, and you can't beat a  urlLink Shaitan . Saddam will magically appear in cuffs two months before the elections and American soldiers will be at their homes partying by New Year's. The ground will start spitting up WMD's and al-Qaeda links the moment he touches the ground with his nose, and he will be the next american president."  Here's me making an effort at being politically conscious.  At heart, I am actually extremely apolitical - I hate conflict and arguing moot issues, I mostly prefer to be couped up in my bubble listening to the Beatles; and not be bothered by all the suffering and injustice that goes on in the world.  It is a daily struggle between the half of me that just wants to chill and enjoy what's going on in my surroundings--knowing fully well that my voice can't make an impact on people's lives halfway across the world--and the side that feels selfish and beligerant not speaking out against what I know is wrong...

       urlLink With Cable TV at M.I.T., Who Needs Napster?  AWESOME. "The quirk in the law that makes the system legal, Mr. Winstein said, has much to do with the difference between digital and analog technology. The advent of the digital age, with the possibility of perfect copies spread around the world with the click of a mouse, has spurred the entertainment industry to push for stronger restrictions on the distribution of digital works, and to be reluctant to license their recording catalogues to permit the distribution of music over the Internet.  So the M.I.T. system, using the analog campus cable system, simply bypasses the Internet and digital distribution, and takes advantage of the relatively less-restrictive licensing that the industry makes available to radio stations and others for the analog transmission."

During that time Jews were in flight and since temples and synagogues were built of wood, they evolved a code to use in knocking on doors to gain admission. Since this resulted in lives being saved, it became commonplace to knock on wood for good luck."

       urlLink Fast Company | If It's Broke, Fix It  Put yourself in your customers' shoes, see what's broken about what you do, and fix it. / Interesting fastcompany article. Typical Godin.   "What about tollbooths? If you live in the Northeast, you know that bridges almost always have tolls, which were originally put in place to pay for the bridges. But do we need tolls today? For every dollar collected on the George Washington Bridge, the government is effectively taxing the people waiting in line. That's at least several dollars in wasted time. You lose the time, but the government gains nothing. There's probably no less efficient way to collect a tax (and that's what a toll is) than making people wait anywhere from five minutes to an hour to pay a few bucks to use a small piece of road. There are dozens of ways to fix this and other things that are broken -- ways that save everyone time and money."

       urlLink Circumcision FAQ   When and why was routine neonatal circumcision introduced in English-speaking Western countries?  Doctors in the English-speaking countries started circumcising babies in the mid-1800s to prevent masturbation, which some doctors claimed caused many diseases, including epilepsy, tuberculosis and insanity. Of course, these arguments are not accepted today.  Nonreligious infant circumcision is not an issue in European, Asian or South American countries. In Canada the average rate of infant circumcision for boys is roughly 25%, with large regional variations. The rate in the United States has dropped to less than 60%, and will drop below 50% in a few years if present trends continue. This is already true in the Western US (35% in 1993).

      Monster Survey Compares Vacation Time Around the Globe   MAYNARD, Mass. - August 27, 2003 - Confirming beliefs that Americans spend more time in the office than their European counterparts, a recent poll of more than 86,000 workers worldwide reveals that 70 percent of Americans and 61 percent of Canadians have 15 days or less of vacation time per year. Comparatively, 82 percent of Europeans receive a minimum of three weeks (a). The Monster Meter, a product of Monster, the leading global online careers site and flagship brand of Monster Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ: MNST), is an ongoing series of online polls that gauge users' opinions on a variety of topics relating to careers, the economy, and the workplace. In the United States, 40 percent of workers respond as only having 10 days or less of vacation time during the entire year, while 30 percent of Canadians take similar time away from the office. However, in Europe, just 5 percent of respondents have 10 days or less of vacation. In fact, 61 percent of workers in Europe enjoy 26 days or more of annual leave. In the U.S., that category accounted for just 1 percent, and in Canada, 11 percent.  "Historically, many European governments have regulated mandatory vacation packages to their employees - a tradition that remains despite heightened unemployment," said Jeff Taylor, Founder and Chief Monster. "The U.S. work culture, among the strongest worldwide, has been defined as driven by high demands, tight deadlines, and long hours. While today's economy limits the amount of vacation time some employees were accustomed to a few years ago, it is important for employers to find other ways to recognize hard work and dedication."  The Monster Meter asked American, Canadian, and European Monster users:   How many days of vacation time do you get per year?   Monster U.S. (b) Monster Canada (c) Monster Europe (d)   10 days or fewer 40% 30% 5%  Between 11 and 15 days 30% 31% 4%  Between 16 and 20 days 17% 16% 9%  Between 21 and 25 days 12% 12% 21%  26 days or more 1% 11% 61%  These findings follow the release of Monster's 2003 work/life survey results, which found that 57 percent of Americans consider themselves overworked (e), 80 percent of Americans are unhappy with their work/life balance (f), and 71 percent admit to clocking more than 40 hours per week (g). Yet another proof point that U.S. workers are struggling to achieve work/life balance in today's continued slow economic period.   For more information on the 2003 Global Vacation Survey including specific country results within Europe or to view the complete 2003 Work/Life Survey, please contact Kevin Mullins at 978-461-8751 or kevin.mullins@monster.com.   (a) Several European countries mandate a minimum annual vacation leave for employees.   (b) The results of the Monster Meter are based on 72,713 votes cast by Monster U.S. users from July 7th to July 14th, 2003 on the Monster homepage. Only one vote per user is counted toward the final tabulation. Anyone interested in voting in Monster's current online poll may do so by logging onto Monster at www.monster.com. Users may review the results of this poll by going to forums.monster.com. These polls are not scientific and reflect the opinions of only those Internet users who have chosen to participate.  (c) The results of the Monster Meter are based on 3,770 votes cast by Monster.ca users from July 7th to July 21st, 2003 on the Monster.ca homepage. Only one vote per user is counted toward the final tabulation.  (d) The results of the Monster Meter are based on 10,251 votes cast across 13 Monster Europe sites: users from July 7th to July 21st, 2003 on the corresponding homepage. Only one vote per user is counted toward the final tabulation.  (e) These results are based on 61,346 votes cast by Monster users from April 14th to April 21st, 2003 on the Monster homepage. Only one vote per user is counted toward the final tabulation.  (f) These results are based on 36,128 votes cast by Monster users from June 16th to June 23rd, 2003 on the Monster homepage. Only one vote per user is counted toward the final tabulation.  (g) These results are based on 64,324 votes cast by Monster users from March 24th to March 31st, 2003 on the Monster homepage. Only one vote per user is counted toward the final tabulation.

But if there is some sort of disaster in Iraq or the economy clearly hasn't gotten better and more jobs aren't created, no amount of rhetoric will save this president.  This is after all a 50-50 nation, split down the middle. It won't take much to tip the election one way or the other."

Now, the only Xenadrine available from Cytodyne is Xenadrine EFX, which is the ephedra free version. This, really is no surprise following Muscletech recent formulation change of their original Hydroxcyut to epherdra free hydroxycut.  The original Xenadrine RFA-1 contained ephedrine. The new Xenadrine EFX by Cytodyne has completely gotten rid of ephedrine, and in place of it, a good mixture of better ingredients. Read our Xenadrine EFX review here. Being ephedrine free, Xenadrine EFX is a much 'friendlier' diet and weight loss supplement than the original RFA-1.   The new ephedrine free Xenadrine so far has shown promising results, with many users reporting excellent weightloss results. Clinical studies have also reported exceptional results with Xenadrine ephedrine free.

       urlLink DJ Dangermouse - The Grey Album download : "DOWNHILL BATTLE -- DJ Danger Mouse's recent Grey Album, which remixes Jay-Z's The Black Album and the Beatles White Album, has been hailed as a innovative hip-hop triumph. Despite that and the fact that only 3,000 copies of the album are in circulation, EMI sent cease and desist letters yesterday to Danger Mouse and the handful of stores that were selling the album, demanding that the album be destroyed.  'EMI isn't looking for compensation, they're trying to ban a work of art,' said Downhill Battle's Rebecca Laurie.  'Special interests, including the major labels, have turned copyright law into a weapon,' said Downhill Battle co-founder Holmes Wilson. 'If Danger Mouse had requested permission and offered to pay royalties, EMI still would have said no and the public would never have been able to enjoy this critically acclaimed work. Artists are being forced to break the law to innovate.' The Grey Album has been widely shared on file sharing networks such as Kazaa and Soulseek, and has garnered critical acclaim in Rolling Stone (which called it 'the ultimate remix record' and 'an ingenious hip-hop record that sounds oddly ahead of its time'), the Boston Globe (which called it the 'most creatively captivating' album of the year), and other major news outlets."

However, the timeline for the introduction of this product must be moved up, or at least Apple should announce that something is coming soon, rather than sit silent like they always do. For every Mac user (and PC user) that is PDA-dependent (and there are more than you might think) who want to upgrade their Computer this year just got a pretty good reason not to buy another Mac. I can hear some of them now; �If I buy that new Mac I won�t be able to use that new Palm-based Clie I�m waiting for!� (I'm Clie biased, I own several and think they are best Palm-based PDA you can buy)  The timeline for this product is an introduction by July 2004. Hopefully Apple will deliver it sooner now that Palm has gone public with its withdrawal of Mac support."

       urlLink My CL Date (WTF!)  I'd be interested in getting people's opinions on this funny (as in "jokes on me" funny) dating experience. What a b*tch! I've changed a couple of names to protect the innocent/guilty. So this is about a girl I met on CL but not in the typical manner. Any input would be nice.   Background: I'd been thinking about buying a motorcycle---the upright kind, not a crotch rocket -- and so I was looking at used bikes on CL. Usually you send an e-mail to get more details and pictures of the bike. So I saw 6-7 that I was interested in and asked for pics/more info. One bike that I liked was a large engine European model >1000cc. It was a little more expensive and bigger than what I wanted, but it was a cool bike and everyone said get a bigger bike b/c you'll eventually want that anyway.   Story: Of all the replies I get, the reply for this bike is the only one from a woman--her e-mail was signed "sarah". Now realize that almost all motorcycles (not talking scooters here) are being sold by men. So falling back on my tried and true stereotypes, I assume that the woman selling this (fairly big) bike is a 300+ pound bull dike. No big deal--I'm not going to date her, I just want to check out the bike.

       urlLink Gates Backs E-Mail Stamp in War on Spam : "February 2, 2004 Gates Backs E-Mail Stamp in War on Spam By SAUL HANSELL  Should people have to buy electronic stamps to send e-mail? Some Internet experts have long suggested that the rising tide of junk e-mail, or spam, would turn into a trickle if senders had to pay even as little as a penny for each message they sent. Such an amount might be minor for legitimate commerce and communications, but it could destroy businesses that send a million offers in hopes that 10 people will respond. The idea has been dismissed both as impractical and against the free spirit of the Internet.  Now, though, the idea of e-mail postage is getting a second look from the owners of the two largest e-mail systems in the world, Microsoft and Yahoo.   Ten days ago, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that spam would not be a problem in two years, in part because of systems that would require people to pay money to send e-mail. Yahoo, meanwhile, is quietly evaluating an e-mail postage plan being developed by Goodmail, a Silicon Valley start-up company.  'The fundamental problem with spam is there is not enough friction in sending e-mail,' said Brad Garlinghouse, Yahoo's manager for communications products.   The company is intrigued by the idea of postage, Mr. Garlinghouse said, because it would force mailers to send only those offers a significant number of people might accept. 'All of a sudden, spammers can't behave without regard for the Internet providers' or end users' interests, ' he said.  Neither Yahoo nor Microsoft have made any commitment to charging postage, in part because the idea still faces substantial opposition among Internet users.   "Damn if I will pay postage for my nice list," said David Farber, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who runs a mailing list on technology and policy with 30,000 recipients. He said electronic postage systems are likely to be too complex and would charge noncommercial users who should be able to send e-mail free.   "I suspect the cost of postage will start out small and it will rapidly escalate," he added.  In the meantime, the big Internet providers, including Microsoft and Yahoo, in recent weeks have renewed talks that stalled last year about creating technological standards to help identify the senders of legitimate e-mail. That way, spammers would either have to identify themselves or risk that users would discard all anonymous mail.  But for the big Internet access providers, or I.S.P.'s, the prospect of e-mail postage creating a new revenue stream that could help offset the cost of their e-mail systems is undeniably attractive.  "Sending large volumes of e-mail involve costs that are paid for by the I.S.P.'s and eventually by consumers," said Linda Beck, executive vice president for operations at EarthLink. "Should there be some sort of financial responsibility borne by the originators of these large volume programs? I think there should." E-mail between private individuals, she added, ought to remain free.   Differentiating among classes of e-mail is one of the substantial technical difficulties that e-mail postage proposals face. In wrestling with this matter, academic researchers have proposed complex stamp systems in which each e-mail recipient sets the price for a message to enter his or her in-box. Mr. Gates talked at Davos about a system that would allow users to waive charges for friends and relatives.   Goodmail, founded by Daniel T. Dreymann, an Israeli entrepreneur, is developing a system that it hopes will be easier to adopt. It proposes that only high-volume mailers pay postage at first, at a rate of a penny a message, with the money going to the e-mail recipient's Internet access provider. (The company suggests, but does not require, that the Internet providers share the payments with their users, either through rebates or by lowering monthly fees.)  The Goodmail system is designed to work even if not all senders and not all Internet providers participate. A mass e-mailer would sign up with Goodmail, buying a block of stamps - actually an encrypted code number - that it would insert in the header of each e-mail message. If the Internet provider of the recipient participates in the system, it decrypts the stamp and submits it to Goodmail. Only then is the sender's account charged a penny and the receiving I.S.P. paid the penny, minus a service fee by Goodmail for acting as a clearinghouse.  Senders do not pay for stamps that are not used, but they do pay whether an e-mail recipient reads the message or not.   Under this plan, Internet providers would still accept incoming e-mail without stamps. But that mail would be subject to the same sort of spam filters in use now, which can at times divert legitimate mail. The Internet providers would deliver all stamped mail without any filter. Goodmail does not require that stamped mail be requested by the recipient, the so-called opt-in requirement of most other anti-spam systems.   "The very notion that I have to get permission to send you a marketing message doesn't make sense and is not good public policy," said Richard Gingras, Goodmail's chief executive. Even so, he said that Goodmail would require mailers to verify their identities and to take people off their mailing lists if such a request was made.  This kind of approach would require major policy changes by Internet providers, which all ban unsolicited e-mail even if they have little ability to block it.   In fact, some experts worry that big spammers will indeed pay the postage. Charles Stiles, manager of the postmaster department at America Online, said he was concerned that such a system might restrict the wrong mail, adding, "It is the spammers who are the ones with the big pockets."  AOL is taking a different approach and is testing a system under development by the Internet Research Task Force. The system, called the Sender Permitted From, or S.P.F., creates a way for the owner of an Internet domain, like aol.com, to specify which computers are authorized to send e-mail with aol.com return addresses. That allows a recipient's e-mail system to determine whether a message being represented as coming from someone at aol.com really is from that address. Most spam being sent now uses forged return addresses.   Microsoft has been floating a similar proposal, labeled "caller ID," that could be expanded in the future to accommodate more sophisticated anti-spam approaches including Internet postage systems. Discussions are under way among the backers of S.P.F., Microsoft and others involved in e-mail to reach a compromise sender notification system.  All these proposals can run into problems because there are legitimate cases when mail sent by one domain claims to be from another. For example, online greeting-card services will send messages with the return address of the person sending the card, even though the message does not go through the sender's e-mail account.  People taking part in the discussion say that companies like greeting-card services may need to change their e-mail software to comply with the new standards.  "Every proposed scheme will break parts of the way e-mail works today," said Hans Peter Brondmo, a senior vice president of Digital Impact who has represented big e-mailers in the spam technology negotiations. The challenge, he said, is to find a system that will require as little retrofitting as possible to e-mail systems.

And all because Janet Jackson showed PART of her breast during the Super Bowl. I don't blame Jackson for the resulting backlash. Part of the blame can be placed on the FCC and reactionary puritanical individuals or politicians of any party who go too far in towing some "indecency intolerance" position swaying whichever way the political winds blow to get votes inspite of rights and freedoms that are guaranteed by the constitution. Those people and also religious zealots are to blame for trying to dictate to the rest of the country what they can or cannot see or hear on radio or tv that was previously acceptable for years but now all of a sudden is not.

In 46 BC, Julius Caesar, pictured above in a self-decreed minted coin, created a calendar system that added one leap day every four years. Acting on advice by Alexandrian astronomer Sosigenes, Caesar did this to make up for the fact that the Earth's year is slightly more than 365 days. In modern terms, the time it takes for the Earth to circle the Sun is slightly more than the time it takes for the Earth to rotate 365 times (with respect to the Sun -- actually we now know this takes about 365.24219 rotations). So, if calendar years contained 365 days they would drift from the actual year by about 1 day every 4 years. Eventually July (named posthumously for Julius Caesar himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter! By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years, the calendar year would drift much less. This Julian Calendar system was used until the year 1582 when Pope Gregory XIIIprovided further fine-tuning when he added that leap days should not occur in years ending in 'OO', unless divisible by 400. This Gregorian Calendar system is the one in common use today. "

It depicts more or less every aspect of the phone - other than the actual operation of Windows Mobile - and seeing it handled in person is even better (to me) than the previous previous videos, which looked like somewhat more 'marketing' focused."

It's much more usable as a phone, however, with dedicated call and hang-up buttons that with characteristic Danger ingenuity, nestle around a more discreet, redesigned wheel. Which also doubles up as the earpiece. Over on the left are the familiar Menu and Jump keys, but are joined by a new D-pad. "

On the face, the new model has a couple of new buttons, a new speaker and mic, and we hear there�s a new screen that looks much better [Editor�s note - turns out this isn�t the case]. But the big news is that the camera is finally built in (with an LED flash), and apparently it�s VGA quality. One of the prominent member Hiptopper took a picture with his new baby and posted it to Hiptop Nation, then whoops, Danger asked him remove to the pic. He did, but that didn�t stop a loyal devotee from posting it to his own site. "

Out of the hundred or so meetings of the principals or cabinet level officials in the Bush administration, only one was about terrorism. Instead, the White House said it would have Vice President Dick Cheney head up a task force to analyze the threat himself. The administration waited five months to create the task force, which then never met.

       urlLink p l a y f a i r : "When Apple opened the iTunes Music Store, they incorporated a technology called 'FairPlay'. FairPlay is a Digital Rights Management (DRM) system that limits a users rights on a digital media file that they've purchased and presumably downloaded. In the case of Apple's iTunes Music Store, when a user downloads an audio track from iTMS, it is a 'Protected AAC Audio File'. When used as intended, these files can only be played through the iTunes program itself. Furthermore, a particular computer must first be 'authorized' to play the given file. FairPlay allows up to three computers and unlimited Apple iPods to be authorized to play the file. As DRM schemes go, FairPlay is only moderately offensive. So what will playfair do for you? The playfair program is quite simple. It takes one of the iTMS Protected AAC Audio Files, decodes it using a key obtained from your iPod or Microsoft Windows system and then writes the new, decoded version to disk as a regular AAC Audio File. It then optionally copies the metadata tags that describe the song, including the cover art, to the new file."

       urlLink HOW TO Tuesday: Make digital movies the easy way - Engadget - www.engadget.com  According to some estimates there are about 60 million (if not more) of you out there with Digital Video Camcorders, just about all DV cameras have Firewire (IEEE 1394) output/input and there are hundreds of millions of DV tapes being shipped per year. The bad news is, we know exactly what happens — you record a lot of stuff to DV tape and never do anything with it. It’s a bit of a hassle to sit and edit for hours when all you want is a 2 minute clip from that birthday party or event. And the truth is, most of the stuff we all shoot is crap since we just aim and record everything. So in this week’s HOW TO Tuesday we show you how to make use of that footage to quickly and easily make movies and automatically add a soundtrack.

The Pilkington Activ glass has a special nano-scale - extremely thin - coating of microcrystalline titanium oxide which reacts to daylight. This reaction breaks down filth on the glass, with no need for detergent. When water hits it, a hydrophilic effect is created, so water and dirt slides off.

It could be that the move is limited only to the Russian market, which is why it hasn’t been announced anywhere else, but c’mon, with sales of regular film cameras flat or falling, you know it’s only a matter of time until all of the big five (which besides Pentax also includes Canon, Konica Minolta, Nikon, and Olympus) kill their consumer film camera lines in favor of digital, leaving film the domain of the professional.

It’s just that the EOS 10D costs five hundred bucks more. So are hacking the firmware on their Digital Rebels so that they can get access to all of the special features that are disabled on the camera that aren’t on the EOS 10D. Which has got to annoy Canon.

Fortunately for you, that was only like last week, and the information is no less pertinent. In fact, with the Sidekick II and the Treo Ace/610 just around the corner, bargain-minded shoppers would do well to pay extra attention to the two devices that are still plenty capable and about to get plenty cheap."

Some of the rumored upgrades: a smaller form factor, similar to themMini in design (which probably means the new scroll wheel), a bigger hard drive and a bunch of color options, such as purple, orange and yellow (why do you taunt us Apple?).

      Yahoo!, Hotmail and Excite Respond to Gmail  Yahoo! Mail has recently enhanced its standard and premium services in response to Google's upcoming Gmail launch. On June 15, Yahoo! Mail increased its storage space to 100 MB for standard users and 2 GB for Yahoo! Mail Plus users. The 2 GB for Plus users is double the storage of Gmail. Yahoo increased the maximum size message that users can send and receive, now up to 10 MB per message.  Yahoo! Mail improved its email search capability and will put more than 50 million email addresses back into distribution. They have also redesigned the web-based email user interface to increase usability.  Hotmail has announced July 2004 plans to upgrade its free email offering in a similar manner to Yahoo! by upgrading services and mail storage capacities. They plan to offer free subscribers 250 MB of storage, up from the current 2 MB limit. Hotmail also plans to offer its anti-virus service for free: it will clean any viruses identified in a subscriber's email. Until now, Hotmail has alerted subscribers of a virus, but not cleaned it or removed it from access.  Excite will soon be increasing storage space from 3 MB to 125 MB for its free email users. They will also increase the maximum size message that users can send and receive, similar to Yahoo! Mail, to 10 MB.

It now advertises itself as the “Gateway of the Americas”. But why should an ambitious Florida city stop there, when “Capital of the Americas” beckons? Or even “Centre of the New World”, as one of its glossy brochures has it? For that is what Miami is now pitching for: already it has launched a big campaign to host the headquarters of the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)."

According to the source, Motorola is still working on the firmware and deciding how much ram should be in the model (initially they were talking about 32MB, which is almost preposterously low for a high-end model like this, but it's since been bumped to 48).

       urlLink T-Mobile Sidekick II Reviewed  So, uhm, I guess the wait for the T-Mobile Sidekick II is about over since PC Magazine just put up a review. Way to start the hype machine, Danger! Maybe they decided not to really talk it up because it looks sort of, you know, bland. I mean, come on, VGA camera? Is the Sidekick destined to remain the sort-of-cool cellphone with the crappy camera? How about user-developed applications? When do we get those?  I guess I'll reserve final judgement until I can play around with the new unit, but for now it looks like a modest upgrade to a unit sorely in need of some juice in the first place. Also, I'm still a little bit bitter Danger got so fussy a few months back when we leaked the images of the Sidekick II. We only leaked because we cared!

They say the camera sucks: "The new model integrates a VGA camera with flash and adds new buttons so you can take pictures with the screen closed. The camera was slow to start up, and our photos were somewhat blurry and full of halos and strange color effects." The old cameras sucked more though.

Since hardly any landline phones can receive text messages (believe it or not, there are actually a few out there), BT’s service uses text-to-speech software to convert the message into a voicemail, even translating that text shorthand favored by teens into something a bit more comprehensible. Or you could just call and leave a voicemail in the first place. Your choice.

What makes the R3 the hands-down best sub-notebook I've ever used? Well, for starters, it actually usable.
