						     Like others before me, this is my first posting to my very own blog. My intention in this blog is to put down at least one specific thought for the day and various other random thoughts I capture. Today, my thoughts are...      Today's thought: Starting this blog      - Filling out the profile on myself for this blog was somewhat of an odd experience. Never having done this before, I found that choosing the "right" personal information wasn't as natural as I thought it would be. First of all, I had to consider that this information may be seen by virtually anybody who wishes to view it. Then I waded through our family pictures to find a "suitable" image of myself, one that was flattering and exhibited the "face" I wanted to show the world. I started to think "What will the viewer/reader conclude about me?". As anyone who knows me or those who read my blog in the future will find out, I tend to be reflective and try to be aware of what I'm feeling/thinking and why. So, recognizing that I am  concerned  about how people will view me based upon my profile made me ask myself the question, "Why do you care what other people will think?". For me, a self-described "easy going person", it came somewhat as a shock that I apparently still have some layers within my personality that aren't as confident and grounded as I thought. Hmmm... Obviously, I still have a long way to go as I try to shape my personality the way I want it to be. More thought required...        Other thoughts     - Lately, I've been studying several "self-help" resources:      urlLink  Today Matters     by   urlLink  Dr. John C. Maxwell      urlLink  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People     by   urlLink  Dr. Stephen R. Covey      urlLink  Lessons in Mastery     by   urlLink  Anthony Robbins      I will try to write about each one of these resources in turn.    - I'm making an effort to create new daily habits that will be beneficial for me. One of them is to try to think of an original idea each day (a suggestion from    urlLink  Thinking for a Change  ,  another  book written by   urlLink  Dr. John C. Maxwell   ). Today's original idea is:     "Could it be that, life is genetically tied to the dimension of time ?" I'm thinking that it seems obvious, but has science overlooked the idea that life progresses in step with time? Since Eistein first postulated the idea of the speed of light and time reversal, it seems to me that science has been enamored with exotic calculations of astronomical events, the content of the universe (dark matter), and the origins of the universe. Although I'm no physicist, it seems to me that underlying all these principals is Einstein's theory of relativity. True? If so and if somehow it were proven that time can not be reversed, what would be the impact to astronomy and other sciences? And what if time were reversable, but the reversal was not symmetric? In other words, if time were reversed, maybe time would take a different path. Wouldn't it be possible to satisfy other scientific laws of the universe (like conservation of energy) but reverse time in an alternative way?
