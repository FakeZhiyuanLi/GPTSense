      Back in Oregon again, it feels great!  I am on the coast right now, just hanging out till I go back to Portland tomorrow for my job interview.  I hate job interviews but I guess I have to do it if I want the job eh?  Then we'll go to REI and hopefully I don't buy too much.  I tried downsizing my wardrobe but REI is just too good...STOP THE INSANITY!  Shopping is bad and addicting, especially when you have some money to spend.  I have lots to do tomorrow though.  interview, bank, register to vote, get an ID card, go shopping and then we're spending the weekend at our friend Jamie's cabin.  It's going to be so much fun just hanging out in the woods!  Feelin' it!  Don't know how much I'll get to blog since I don't even have my place set up yet.  I don't even have a computer but my future rooomate Erika! has one so hopefully I'll be updating soon.  Not that anyone reads this...

      Never talk politics with your grandma.     I didn't do it on purpose and I really don't know how it came up.  But it did.  We were in the car driving to a picnic when we saw some army people walking around.   Here is the conversation that followed...     Grandma:   I thought you would have joined the army someday and been a good soldier.   Me:   Well I don't believe in war.   G:  It's not always about war.  They protect our country.   M:  But it's always about money.  In war you are killing thousands of innocent victims.   G:  What about Japan and the bombs?   M:  Yeah that was all wrong and they were all innocent.  It's the government.   G:  No it's not all about money.  What about Pearl Harbor?   M:  That's a whole 'nother story.  Well this war is about money, and oil.  G: No it's because of what they did on 9/11.   M:  They never proved anything yet.  Where are the WMD in Iraq?   G:  What are you reading or watching?  They are telling you lies.   M:  We're in a war we shouldn't be in, killing innocent people.   G:  They have cells all over the place and they killed thousands in 9/11.   M:  Bush just wanted to go to war.   G:  They had a threat in Clinton's time.   M:  It was Bush #1's unfinished business. Oil.   G:  Stop Bush-bashing.   M:  It's a free country.  (Did I really say that to my grandma?!  yikes)   G:  People die for your freedom.   M:  They do, because they are told to.    Yeah that was a heated conversation I didn't want to have.  War sucks.  I love my grandma but she doesn't see all the wrong in this war.  Why are we there still?  The Iraqi people do not want us there.  No one likes Americans.

      so i've been working on my webpage.  surprisingly, this can take up lots of my time.  how did i have time to do this before and study??  hmm...it is totally fun though and I doubt anyone looks at it.  why don't i have anything interesting to say?  i planted some bell peppers in my grandparents garden today and i'm going golfing tomorrow...excitement here!!  i want to see farenheit 9/11, anyone seen it yet?  and i won't be here when it comes out to the $1 theaters either.  shucks.  i've added lots of sections to my page, the biggest one today was on simple living.  i am trying to be more simple.  don't laugh okay?  i am a pretty complex person with lots of junks and i am trying to live with less...is it possible?  i hope so.  having 4 of the same shirt in different colors is not a good thing.

      The key to this blog really is boredom because without it I wouldn't be on the internet.  I could either go to sleep or cruise around on the net.  I was watching tv and I also went to workout but man this is too much fun...right.  Who reads these things?  Not me.  Last night I was checking out the schedules for the upcoming PAC-10 football season.  The BEAVERS will have a tough opening at LSU but hopefully we'll be somewhat prepared.  Other than that I think our conferece season will be competitive but we will come out on top.  OH YEAH BABY!!  Especially with some key teams coming into Corvallis.  Watch out little duckies.

      I have tried this before and really I don't think anyone read it so why am I doing it again?  I don't know and maybe it's just pure boredom.  Maybe this time someone will read it.  Maybe...Who cares, I am here and writing and that's all that matters.  There are so many pages on the internet that no one reads anyway, it's just a big giant space cluttered with pages and pages of stuff.  Kind of like my life, but I am trying to clear that up.  I am simplifying.  Yes this seems crazy since I am making it more difficult by creating a blog that will essentially tie down a part of my day.  Or many parts.  When I did a blog on xanga it was pretty obsessive and then I realized that everything I wrote my mom could read and tried to delete it cause it was nonsense you wouldn't want your mother to read.  But I couldn't delete it so I just made everything white.  If you highlighted it you would be able to read it but I don't think she would've thought of that.  Anyhoo that's it for now.

      i've noticed that people that live in the city are pretty crazy.  take the man next to me at the computer for instance, he placed the monitor up on a stack of telephone books and is currently cleaning out the computer mouse (which was invented by an OSU graduate).  he took the ball out and is blowing into the poor bugger.  what a weirdo.  then there are all the homeless crazy people who yell at you and ask for money in the same sentence.  like i'm gonna give you money if you're yelling at me.  fuck off.  i am sure they are all nice people with shitty lives but don't yell at me man.  other than the crazies, portland is great.  i don't have a job yet and really haven't done much more than explore the city by streetcar and walking but hey it's fun times.  i need a job.
