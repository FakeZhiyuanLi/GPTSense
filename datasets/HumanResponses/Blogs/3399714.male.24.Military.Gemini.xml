      You know, you think that a weekend is just a construct of our 40 hour work week, but here, I feel myself much less motivated on the "weekend."  Most times I don't even know what day it is, but I have a harder time waking up.  (Yes, hardER time.  We all know I have a hard time waking up as it is.  Except this one time, I got a buddy of mine to wake me up and hand me a cup of coffee.  That was awesome!)  Anyway, so it's Sunday here and I have the wonderful opportunity to be in my PTs at 10 am!  (Also drinking some WONDERFUL black coffee.)   So, another little story about the trash cleanup day.  We're driving around, giving out trash bags and taking pictures of people cleaning up.  We get to this one apartment were no one is working.  So, we get out of the truck and are trying to figure out who is the apartment manager.  Meanwhile, bunches of kids start showing up (I swear they have kiddie observation posts to track the CPT's movements).  They're doing their typical "Meeeeester Meeeeester!  Gimmie food.  Gimmie water.  Gimmie that.  Gimmie this."  (Donk, I know you know what I'm talking about here.)  We're trying to get them to help out picking up trash but they (all of a sudden) don't understand any English.  We're trying for about 5 minutes and then the Captain asks us for one dollar bills.  He does nothing more than flash a few one dollar bills and the kids go NUTS!  They're grabbing bags from each other, flinging trash in the bags, RUNNING to pick it up.  It was like the Tazmanian Devil at work.  Amazing what a simple good old American dollar bill will do here.  If only everyone was like that.  Here IGC, here's a dollar.  Play nice with each other and get this country working again.   You need candy too?  Okay, here's two butterscotch disks.  Go rebuild Iraq.   June 30th is going to be a VERY interesting time.  Iraq is becoming a soverign nation.  I have to say, it's pretty cool to be here at the birth of a nation.  And for all of you who think the new government of Iraq will ask the American soldiers to leave.  Not a chance.  If that happens, they'll be a new government in Iraq the next day.  Yeah, say Hi to Mr. Coup.  The Iraqis do NOT want us to leave.  They love having us here protecting them and keeping them safe.  Do not let the media tell you different.  B

      Yesterday I saw something I did not think I would see here.  We had an cleanup day in the apartments in our sector.  I truthfully thought that no one would really come out to clean, especially since the apartments have been TRASHED for forever.  When we rolled into the apartment complex, almost everyone was hard at work.  Picking up garbage, sweeping sidewalks, trimming bushes.  It was amazing.  Iraqis actually taking pride in their living areas and putting in several hours in 110 degree heat to make it nicer.  I swear we gave out about a hundred big trashbags.  Amazing.  After they got finished, the area looked SO GOOD.  It was absolutely shocking.  Actually, the shocking thing was that the majority of the residents wanted to do this at LEAST once a month.  That's almost unheard of here.  WOW.  Maybe we are making a good impression here and positively influencing people.  So, time to get back to work.  B

      This has been a phenominally better day than yesterday.  I'm actually in a good mood.  Lol.  Gotta finish typing up these debriefs, drop them off, and then maybe do some PT.  I'll type a better entry later.  B   Quote of the Day:  While I was taking a picture of a man and his family.  He points to his wife (who knows no English) and says in a perfect monotone "This is my wife.  I want to push her in the river.  Stand right there honey."

      Today was an INCREDIBLY long day.  Wow.  I finally got back at 9:30 pm.  No dinner and I hate MREs.  But I ate one anyway.  Started out wierd...ended weird...lots of wierd in the middle.  For some reason today was "Fire lots of Rockets into the Green Zone day."  We had 5 impacts here today.  Um, that's an increase from normal by...um...FIVE.  Lol.  No damage and no injuries, thank God.  The one I got to analyize did make a heck of a crater.  It was about 2 feet deep and 3 feet wide.  A pretty nice one.  Anyway, I think I'm going to tuck myself into bed now and prepare for another fun "Meet the Community" Tuesday.  Whoopie!  They usually turn into LT Hall takes names and pictures to issue ungodly numbers of badges.    Quote of the day:  "Bring my truck here, I need my phone."  Said from the commander to his driver 200 feet away.

      So, here's another one for my great stories collection.  I've finally sat down, loosened up my boots, and started to watch a little TV.  One of the guys on radio comes in and tells me that we have a situation.  The guy controling power to a large part of the Green Zone has shut down the power and locked himself in the power station until he gets paid.  So, I jump up and go to the radio to find out more information.  This guy has gotten 4 guys with AK-47s to protect him inside the building and is demanding 4 or 5 dollars to turn back on the power.  FOUR or FIVE DOLLARS?  I call back and ask if someone has considered just giving him 5 dollars.  Of course I'm shaking my head.  They come back that he wants 5 dollars from EACH FAMILY he supplies power to.  He supplies 30 families so that makes about 150 dollars.  He's shut off power to an American checkpoint for 150 dollars.  That not make sense to anyone else?  And of course, after briefing our Commanding officer, he goes running out to the checkpoint to, I assume, meet the business end of MR. LONG RIFLE.  :-)  LOL.  So, I'm still waiting to hear the end of this one.  I'll update this when I find out.  UPDATE:  Sure enough, they did a cordon and raid.  Meaning, they surrounded the building and then told the people inside we would shoot them if they didn't come out.  There were 2 armed guards (who were FPS Workers, Iraqis we hire, give uniforms and weapons to guard things in Iraq) who tried keep their weapons.  Apparently, put your weapon down or we WILL shoot is an effective statement outside of movies.  So, endstate is power back on to the checkpoint and to the families.

      Every day I check the news and swear for a week there's been something about Abu Ghraib there.  Yes, it was no way to treat prisioners but I have a few observations.  First, we're supposed to treat prisioners with respect but what happens when an American soldier gets captured?  He's beaten, tortured, hung from a bridge, beheaded, need I go on?  But that still doesn't give us a right to treat prisioners badly.  Next, the people in Baghdad do not care.  I've had the opportunity to ask around and no one cares.  The comment I've heard most is that if they hadn't done something bad in the first place, they never would have ended up in Abu Ghraib.  The media has built this up into some sort of atrocity that has outraged the Iraqi people.  The day (last Wednesday) that the first American soldier was put on trial, we were expecting a protest to number in the thousands.  100 people showed up.  ONE HUNDRED.  That's it.  And most of them had signs saying "No to Terror."  They walked around for about an hour and left.  That doesn't seem to me to be widespread outrage of the Iraqi people.        And lastly, we were having a conversation about the subject and an NCO made this point.  It's never the front-line combat soldiers that do this type of thing.  It's always some rear echelon non-combat puke 3 times removed from the action that does it.  There are so many good men here that would never do anything like that.  Especially taking orders from who they're claiming they took orders from.      I hope all that made sense.  After another cup of coffee I'm going to reread it and make sure it makes sense.  Just to be clear I do NOT condone what happened at that prision.  But it is not the outrage here among the Iraqi people that the media is making it out to be.

      One of the interesting things here is that Friday is the day off here.  Yeah, the only day off.  So, you know what that means.  All the Iraqis get drunk and party on Thursday night.  Lol.  And yes, for those of you who thought like me, that there's a stigma on alcohol.  NOPE.  They get raging drunk just like us.  They especially like to get drunk and drive by our FOB flipping us the bird.  We just laugh.  And, humorously, they have no minimun drinking age.  That reminds me of a funny story.  Me and this SSG are sitting in the back of a Humvee chilling waiting for the XO to get done with an errand.  And of course, as we sit there, all the kids are driving up on their little scooters (I swear, all of them have one) asking us if we want to buy DVDs.  These two ride up and I notice that the scooter is kinda swerving.  The kid gets close and I swear he'd been smoking some wacky weed.  So, the SSG and I are teasing him.  "Dude, you're stoned out of your mind."  He finally goes  "3 beers!" and almost falls off his scooter.  At that point, I'm ROLLING.  Then he zips off, swerving all over the road.  ROTFLOL!

      But as my boss says, sleep is overrated and that's why coffee is very much my friend.  I don't even put anything in it anymore.  Black as motor oil to get me going in the morning.  But at least it's always something different waking me up earlier than I want to.  Sometimes it's car bombs, sometimes rockets, sometimes people at one of the checkpoints who have "information", and sometimes just choppers buzzing our building for no apparent reason.  Like I said, at least it changes.  Green Day's Time of Your Life just came on the radio.  Wow that brings be back to freshman year in college.  Who would have thought I'd be sitting in Iraq 5 years later.  Jeez.  Anyway.  I gotta get back to entering the rest of the Iraqi names I've got into my database.  I swear these people need birth control bad.  Dude 60 years old, 10 kids...in a 2 room apartment.     Something just wrong with that.  But props to the old dude.  ;-)   Lata.

      Today was a badge making day.  For those of you not up to speed on what's going on, I'll put together a post explaining all about my job here.  But for now, all you need to know is that I'm in the Green Zone of Baghdad, Iraq, responsible for the security here.  In that job, we have to make sure that the only people in the GZ are the ones that live here.  In order to regualate that, we have to make badges.  These badges are such a pain in my butt.  Instead of just making a decision to issue out all new badges to everyone living here, the powers that be are trying to pass the buck to someone else.  The CPA wants us to do it.  We want the CPA to issue a badge.  I'm thinking that it'll end up being ME and my company issuing badges.  The badges issued by the unit before us were VERY simple.  One sided and easy to make.  But also, very easy to counterfeit.  Battalion decided we needed to make badges that were hard to dupe.  Without getting into the details of it, I enlisted the help of some SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) in the field of ID card making (;-)) and came up with a pretty good badge, if I do say so myself.  But the kicker is that they're harder and more time consuming to make.  This isn't a big problem when you're making 10 or 20.  But for the 10,000 people that live in the Green Zone, it's a BIG deal.  I only made 70 today and it took me all afternoon.  Heaven help me when it's decided I have to make all 10,000 badges.  Well, 9930 badges.  Alright.  Time for a shower and my bed.  Later!

      My first post on here.  I've thought about doing one of these for a while now and finally decided it might be a good way to keep track of what goes on while I'm in Baghdad.  Quite a lot of interesting stuff goes on here, and I'll do my best to keep up with it.  I hope ya'll enjoy reading about it and please let me know if you do.  B

      So, it's nighttime on the 30th of June.  They transfered power two days ago and NOTHING has happened.  No massive attack.  No volleys of rockets screaming into the Green Zone.  No VBIEDS.  This is totally unexpected in it's quietness.  You can feel the tension, as everyone is actuely aware that things could get out of hand at any moment.  This is a terrible place to be, afraid to be happy that things went smoothly and afraid that the attacks will start at any minute.  I even had a dream last night about standing on the top of an apartment building watching hundreds of rockets impact on the Green Zone.  Not exactly a plesant dream.  Anyway, so, even the news is covering other things than Iraq.  In fact, not one article on my yahoo homepage is about Iraq.  Kinda feels wierd.  Like, that this isn't a good thing.  That the only way things get covered here in Iraq are if people get killed or seriously hurt.  OR if we mess something up.  Then for sure it'll be covered.  Anyway, so we're just waiting for the other shoe to drop.  The more hopefull, optimistic side of me is hoping that all the bad guys have decided to wait and see if Iraq really can be governed by Iraqis.  The more realistic side of me thinks that they're just waiting a few days until everything calms down a little, and then they'll launch their attacks.  But, I don't think anyone really knows what's going to happen.  So, as usual, I'll keep ya'll posted!  B

      I wake up this morning to the words "hey, they're turning over soverignty in like an hour.  wake up."  Lol.  Which, of course, confused me so much cause I knew it wasn't Wednesday.  But as I woke up, I realized that it was a fantastic idea.  If it caught all of us off guard, it certainly caught all the bad guys off guard.  Paul Bremer only knew 30 minutes before we did.  In fact, I went to my normal monday meeting with the Iraqis in our area, and THEY didn't even know.  I had to tell them.  Hey, congrats.  You're in charge of your country now.  Enjoy!   They seemed all happy at first, but then, I think they realized all the things the Coalition was doing for them, they had to do now.  For themselves!  I'm pretty sure they wanted to give their soverignty back.  Lol.  Unfortunately, we're pretty sure the bad guys will still try to do lots of damage, but at least they can't impact the change in soverignty.  That's the good thing.  So, that's about all that's going on right now.  Tomorrow should be a very interesting day.  Stay tuned!  B

      This article is written by an embedded reported that came here for a few days.  Enjoy.   Green Zone: Safest place to be in Iraq  U.S. troops who guard Baghdad's Green Zone confident but cautious  10:52 PM CDT on Friday, June 25, 2004 By ED TIMMS / The Dallas Morning News   BAGDHAD, Iraq – Baghdad's so-called Green Zone is Iraq's ultimate gated community.   Heavily armed soldiers control access to the area's closed-off streets in central Baghdad, aided by a seemingly impregnable maze of dirt-filled barriers and imposing concrete walls topped with razor wire. From observation posts above, troops monitor potential threats.   Because U.S. occupation authorities and members of the emerging Iraqi government live and work in the Green Zone, keeping it safe and secure is a top priority. U.S. soldiers and Iraqi National Guard forces search thousands of pedestrians and vehicles that enter the area daily. In addition, high-tech sensors and dogs trained to sniff out explosives help keep bombs from getting inside.   First Lt. Jordan Enger, 24, of Houston is a 2002 graduate of Texas A&M University who serves with the task force responsible for defending the Green Zone and some of the adjacent neighborhoods. He said tight security "creates a much different atmosphere" than the rest of Baghdad.   "With our presence here, it's definitely the safest place to be in Iraq," he said.   In fact, life inside the Green Zone is more low-key. Pizza takeout is available. Nonmilitary personnel can visit several bars. Soldiers can walk around their compounds without helmets and body armor..   Civilian joggers in shorts and T-shirts or tank tops run along the streets unarmed. Women, including Iraqis, are more likely to wear Western clothes, including jeans and short-sleeved blouses.   But the Green Zone is a big target for insurgents who want to sabotage U.S. efforts to establish a more stable and democratic government in Iraq.   "If we don't protect this base of power, then we'll never get a reasonable democracy or government stood up in this country," said Lt. Col. Robert Campbell, 42, of Bonham, who commands the nearly 1,100 soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division's 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, and other units that comprise "Task Force Warhorse."   His soldiers are taking additional measures to beef up defenses and rehearsing for possible attacks in the coming days.   Even now, the Green Zone is not immune to attack. Mortar shells and rockets randomly detonate within its boundaries, usually harmlessly. Occasionally, car bombs – to date, the deadliest method of attack employed by insurgents – explode just outside its boundaries.   So far, none of the car bombs have made it past the defenses. Insurgents sometimes fire at the soldiers manning the checkpoints, from the cover of buildings or from vehicles. But the task force has suffered no fatalities.   "It's like water coming up against the dam," Sgt. Daniel Stinebaugh, 43, of Killeen, said of the violence on the Green Zone's edges.    No illusions of safety   The soldiers have no illusions, however, that they have it safe or have the luxury of relaxing their guard. They know that insurgents would like nothing more than to successfully launch an attack against what is effectively Iraq's political and military nerve center – and that their security measures are constantly being probed for weaknesses.   "It's very hard to stop somebody who's willing to give their life for what they believe in, right, wrong, or indifferent," Col. Campbell said. "We know we can't stop a car bomber from setting off a bomb outside a checkpoint, or right at a checkpoint. What we can do is limit the number of casualties."   A tangible reminder of the risk is gouged into the road that passes through Checkpoint 11. The filled crater marks the spot where a car bomb exploded on May 6, killing Arkansas Army National Guard Staff Sgt. Hesley Box Jr., 24, of Nashville, Ark., and seven Iraqis, shortly before Col. Campbell formally took command of the area.   At checkpoints, soldiers give Iraqi workers and residents the most scrutiny. Residents have been issued identification cards. They can receive visitors from outside the Green Zone but must meet them at a checkpoint and surrender their identification cards, as must the guests. The documents are returned when the visitors leave.   Iraqi workers and residents sometimes must wait for hours in line to be screened before they can enter the Green Zone.   "At the same time, there are ways that you can show that you care," said Staff Sgt. Richard Barrera, 25, of Fort Worth. "Some guys who are sweating in the hottest part of the day, maybe you offer them a drink of cold water. Somebody who looks like they're hungry, you offer them a little food."   This week, traffic at one checkpoint was halted for more than 90 minutes when tests indicated that a car might be carrying explosives.   "We upset some of the residents who live here ... but we don't want anyone driving through here while there is possibly a car bomb," said 1st Lt. Bryan Frizzelle, 24, of Baltimore.   None were found in the car.   The soldiers who man the checkpoints develop a knack for spotting vehicles and individuals who merit more scrutiny.    The 'low-riders'   Sgt. Edwin Ordanza, 36, a native of Baguio in the Philippines, looks for "low-riders" – cars that seem weighted down. People who seem nervous, appear to be sweating excessively, or whose hands shake as the soldiers check their identification also are more likely to get more attention.   Some soldiers are able to tell when a vehicle that's not normally in the neighborhood is parked on the street, potentially a car bomb.   Getting to know the neighborhood also may lessen the chance of a misunderstanding with potentially dire consequences.   Spc. Joseph Lampron, 43, of Rumford, R.I., one of several Rhode Island National Guard members who volunteered for service in Iraq, learned that some Iraqis living near Checkpoint 11 raise homing pigeons and wave flags to get them to land or fly. Soldiers who were unaware of what they were doing, he said, thought it might be a signal to insurgents.   To break the monotony, soldiers rotate through different positions at the checkpoints, and many go on patrols through Iraqi neighborhoods in the Green Zone, or in adjacent neighborhoods under Task Force Warhorse's control.   "Everybody likes patrols," said Sgt. 1st Class John Kaasch, 40, of Columbus, Neb. "One reason is that you get out and mingle with the civilian population."   By cultivating relationships with Iraqi residents, the soldiers said they hope to encourage their cooperation in helping deny insurgents use of Iraqi neighborhoods in the zone to launch attacks. They also said they want to help Iraqis improve their neighborhoods.   Capt. Alexander Rasmussen, 27, of Crown Point, Ind., the task force's civil affairs officer, said projects valued at about $500,000 – ranging from sewage system improvements to school supplies – have been funded in its area of responsibility. Task Force soldiers have helped jump-start neighborhood governing councils and provided aid to businesses.   Capt. Henry Alvarez, 31, of Roswell, N.M., whose soldiers operate in the Iraqi neighborhoods inside the Green Zone, said he is asked to help resolve everything from housing issues to domestic disputes.   "The only thing I have trouble with is everybody wants me to come over and eat at their house – and the Iraqi food kind of tears me up sometimes," he said.   http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/ latestnews/stories/062604dnintgreenzone.746f.html

      With what's been going on here, I got tasked to work night checkpoint last night.  Wow, what a tedious boring shift.  I stood up in one of the guard towers and watched traffic.  Woo hoo.  I ate so many sunflower seeds it wasn't even funny.  But, it was pointed out to me that being bored is much better than the alternative.  I was so glad to get back and fall asleep.  Especially since I hadn't really slept in like 3 days.  Anyway.  So, Baghdad.  There's just this...tension right now and we're still FIVE days away from the transfer of power.  And there's not guarantee that things will calm down after that.  Some here think it's going to be just like the year 2000 thing.  Lots of freaking out before hand and absolutely nothing happens on the actual day.  I sure hope that'll be the case.  But, I can't shake the feeling that the really bad attacks are still to come.  And for the most part, it isn't even Iraqis causing all these problems.  It's these foreign fighters who are scared to death of a healthy powerful Iraq.  They will do whatever it takes to keep Iraq down and fighting with itself.  Even Al Sadr, once he talked with the Iraqi President, agreed to stand down his militia and become a political power instead of a military one.  But, we'll just have to wait and see what happens.  (I have to admit, it is pretty cool to be here at the "birth of Iraq" and witnessing all this first hand.)  I'll keep ya'll updated.  B

      The proverbial stuff has hit the fan.  We've been waiting for it for a while, but it is still a tad bit of a surprise to wake up and realize that the bad guys have launched their major offensive.  What I've read so far is that 4 cities are being targeted and multiple things are happening here (I can't really post those).  What's worse is that I tried from 11 pm to 6 am to fall asleep.  I finally fell to sleep around 6 am and of course, got woken up several hours after that for dumb stuff.  So, I'm pretty thankful for all types of caffiene right now, especially iced coffee.  There's not much more I can post on here about what's going on, but things are crazy.  I will continue to try to post small blurbs to let you know what I can.  B

      Anon#2 got me thinking of another fun encounter with Iraqi Culture...My first day riding around with the unit we were to replace, they were telling us the small bits about meeting people here.  As we rolled up to a house, they told us that if we wanted to drink the local water, it was our choice, that it didn't mess you up that bad.  I just kind of shook my head.  So we sit down, and the owner of the house brings out a pitcher or tap water and ONE glass.  So, I'm kind of wondering where the other glasses are as the first guy takes the glass, drinks the water and hands it back to the host.  He fills the glass back up and hands it to the next guy.  And of course, I'm like the last guy in the line of people.  Now, being new, I'm being really paranoid about offending people I've just met so, it comes my turn, I took the glass and drank a couple of sips.  Hoping he would be offending, I handed the glass back and all was good!  Well, not all was good about an hour later...but I think you can figure that one out on your own...  B

      HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!  For all fathers out there but especially for mine, because every day I realize a little more just how right he was on just about everything and how I wish I had just taken his advice.  Especially the advice to maybe not do ROTC.  lol.  But, here I am and I just want everyone to know how absolutely great a father I have.  Thanks so much Dad, for everything.  (And there should be a phone bank set up here in the next few days, so I look forward to calling home.)  B

      Well, I guess here it would TAIT (Thank Allah It's Thursday).  Anyway, last night, some Iraqis got married and the Reception got a tad out of hand.  Apparently one guy accused another of stealing beer and things went downhill.  By our reports, it was a 100 person brawl and I missed it.  Bummer.  Ah, probably a good thing, as soon as we showed up to start crackin heads there would have been news cameras all over that place.  So, I guess it's a good thing we missed it.  I definitely just passed out for like 3 hours today.  I'd been outside all day, drinking more water than I thought humanly possible, and started not to feel so good.  So, once we got back, I decided to lay down for a bit and woke up 3 hours later.  Lol.   So, I read the other day some group conducted a poll in Iraq and found out that all of them want us gone and see us as occupiers.  Well, I know where they must not have checked.  The Green Zone, cause everyone I've talked to, young or old, has said they like having us around.  That if we leave, there will be a civil war.  One said asking us to leave is like playing Russian Roulette with an automatic pistol.  I don't know if maybe it's just that our unit has had the right approach, or that we have the right people, but they like having us in charge of their security.  They surely do not want Iraqis in charge of their security, too many are still taking bribes and not enforcing all the laws.  My crew was discussing that they just need to grab up all the Queen's New York cops, hand them the rules, and let them loose.  The Iraqis would never know what hit them.  I'd love to sit back and watch that transformation.  Anyway, my main point is that the Iraqis do actually want us here, at least until they can clear out the corruption and get their feet up under them, then they will allow us to leave and invade Syria.  J/K.  Well........

      As you know by now, my unit is responsible for the security in the Green Zone.  And in that "Green" Zone, we have an apartment complex inhabited by mostly good people, but we know there are some bad living there that we haven't managed to uncover yet.  So, the people requested that we seal off all but one of the entrances to this apartment complex to increase the security and allow no unauthorized access.  Being the high speed unit we are, we immediately began emplacing a barrier for the 2nd biggest entrance (one that leads in from a back way).  So, we blocked off this entrance with concrete barriers and LOTS of concerntina wire to make sure no one could get through.  As we're putting this up, two old women walk up and start argueing with us.  They tell us their house is right over there and could they get through.  No, this is blocked off, you need to go around.  But but but.  They stayed there for like 30 minutes trying to argue with us.  I think finally they realized that we weren't going to open it up just for them and so they left.  It couldn't have been more than 5 minutes later when I saw them on the other side of the barrier entering their house.  So, for those who are now wondering why in the world I told you this story, here's the point.  Sometimes, I feel like Iraq is just like these two women.  They'd rather sit and argue and complain then just do a little extra work to solve their problems.  They want us to do everything for them.  I mean, don't get me wrong, there are those here that have done TONS of hard work to solve their own problems, but the majority of them just want us to do everything for them.  I have serious doubts at this point that Iraq can become a soverign nation in 14 days.  But, I guess we'll see...

      At lunch today with my CPT, and two of our translators, (one who is like 24 and the other who's like 50ish) the server handed us all canned sodas.  I take mine, and like subconciously, like normal, I tap the top of the can to make sure it doesn't explode when I open the can.  Our younger interp looks over at me and says, "Why do Americans tap the top of the can before they open it, because I've started doing it and I've been saying to my self 'you IDIOT, you keep tapping the top of your can and you have NO idea why you're doing it!' so please tell me why you do that?!?"  I'm just rolling on the floor at this point, so, I stop laughing long enough to explain it knocks the bubbles off the sides of the can, keeping it from exploding when you open it.  He looked SO relieved when I finished.  So, now he knows why he's tapping the top of the can.  LOL.

      For those of you who took the time to read the post on what my job is here, first off, congrats for making it through that post, and secondly, here's a little more to add to that.  As a lieutenant in the Field Artillery, there are three jobs I am supposed to have before I make CPT (usually takes 3ish years):  Fire Support Officer (FSO), Fire Direction Officer (FDO), and Platoon Leader (PL).  I'll spare you all the boring details of what these jobs would entail if we were back at Hood.  I'll just fill you in on what they mean here.  Basically you know what I do right now as an FSO.  The PL and FDO, as far as I know, have both been turned into patrol leaders with the mission of escorting important guys around baghdad.  It's a very interesting and ever changing job.  Obviously there's a reason I'm explaining all this (no snickering, I heard that), that I'm due for a change in jobs here soon.  I've been an FSO for about as long as I could manage and they're telling me it's time to move on.  Partly I do want to move, but partly I want to stay doing the job that I'm doing.  I'm right here in the thick of everything that's going on.  You cannot find a more central location than the Green Zone.  But, I keep seeing lieutenants who have no leadership skills or understanding of how an officer is supposed to act, running platoons right into the ground.  So, I want my own platoon, so I can use all the things that I've been seeing, good and bad, to run a platoon well.  Well, at least I hope I can.   The big news, and what prompted this entry, was that one of my fellow LT's might get relieved here soon, and since I'm next to move, that would mean I would take his platoon.  So, this could all change very shortly, OR at the scheduled time in 3 months.  I'll definitely keep you informed.  B

      In order to get in the checkpoint, you have to have some sort of access badge, and in some cases, a memoradum with a proper photo ID can get you in.   So, this one time...at the checkpoint, this teenager walks up and says he works at the hospital, he needs to get to work.  They ask him for some proof, and he's got no badge, no name or number to call, nothing.  They tell him without some sort of proof he's not getting in.  He stands there for a second, walks 20 feet away, and whips a piece of wrinkled paper out of his pocket.  He scribbles furiously on it (IN ARABIC) for a few seconds and signs the bottom.  He turns, walks back to the checkpoint, and hands it to the soldier.  He says that this his is proof that he works at the hospital.  The soldiers just shakes his head.  Just go away.

      For those I've left wondering just what is it I'm actually doing over here, I'm going to try to explain all that my job entails over here.  I am the FSIO for my company, FSIO standing for Fire Support and Information Officer.  My primary job, and what I went to school for, is the coordination of all indirect fires (artillery, mortars, close air support, attack aviation) for the company.  Well, since we're not doing much shooting of artillery in downtown Baghdad, they added the Information Officer part.  This part means basically that anything not normally done by the company, I get to do.  Yipee.  Primarily, that's debriefing every section when they get finished with a patrol in the Green Zone.  I pass that up to higher so they can decide what to do with the info I gather.  I also gather HUMINT (human intelligence), which is a glorified way to say that I talk to people about things that are going on and hope that at somepoint they tell me about bad people doing bad things in our area.  That is without a doubt the most fun, becuase I geniunely enjoy talking to Iraqis and finding out how they think.  Also, in my scope of responsibilites is handling GZ access badges, translators, the census of everyone in the GZ, any walk-up HUMINT source, and any other thing that no one wants to do.  That may sound like a gripe, but it ensures that my job is very varied and I cannot get bored doing the same thing every day.  Burned out, but never bored.  Lol.  OH, and any impact in our area, I have to go there ASAP and analyize it to figure out where and what was fired.  I love that job most.  LOL.  So, I hope that explains things a little.  Any confusion, just leave a comment, and I'll clear it up.  B

      A few weeks ago, an Iraqi approached me while I was chilling out by our Humvee.  He started talking almost perfect english (a semi-rare thing here) telling me that he was Iraqi but had moved to Oregon and become an American citizen.  (He showed his passport and Oregon driver's licence.)  He had come back because he was homesick and wanted to visit the new Iraq.  His issue dealt with borrowing the apartment his brother's cousin lived in and paying to have his brother live outside the Green Zone.  This was very important because his wife and kids were coming here for their summer vacation.  I thought that was pretty cool, except I think I would have waited at least a year before bringing my family here.  Anyway.  So, he goes in to talk to the Neighborhood Advisory Council (who controlled housing at this time, and was trying to figure out who lived in each apartment and whether they were their illegally) and they told him to bring the apartment owner in to discuss the issue soon.  So, yesterday, this guy, named Laith, and his brother's friend show up.  The NAC tries to sort it all out and find out if he is telling the truth.  During the discussion, I'm kinda zoned out since it's all in Arabic.  I hear the noise level rise dramatically and so I start paying attention again.  My translator is like 3 feet from this guy and they are both shouting at each other.  The other NAC members join in and I realize they're about to throw down.  So, I jump up, one hand on my pistol, and move over to calm the situation down.  As I walk over, everyone starts standing up and yelling.  The room goes quiet just as I grab the interpreter to ask what's going on.  At that point, the CPT comes in (he'd be outside the room) and pushes the two apart.  I'm like, what's going on?  He just said that he would kill anyone who tried to take his apartment away from him or go in the apartment.  And that he is an Amercian citizen so they cannot do this to him.  One of the NAC members throws down his badge saying he's going to quit because of the threat on his life.  The CPT tells him to SIT! We verify that this AMERICAN CITIZEN just threatened the lives of Iraqis.  Sure enough he did.  The CPT calls for Zip cuffs and says "LT, grab your rifle and lock and load."  CHA CHINK.  He realizes at that point how deep he's in and tries to backtrack.  Too late bubba.  We haul him out in zip cuffs.  I'm just shaking my head at this point.  What a bonehead move.  What was he thinking?  Jeez.  So, drive him over and lock him up in an Iraqi prison.  As we're leaving, he asks, what did I do?  Both the CPT and I give him a incredulous look and the CPT says, you threatened to KILL members of Iraq.  He looks at us and with all seriousness says, but I have free speech.  I was just using my free speech rights.  What?  Bubba, you're in IRAQ.  They haven't quite gotten to putting that in their constitution yet.  And you cannot even threaten people in the US.  I'm again shaking my head.  And yeah, guy, WELCOME TO IRAQ.

      We got a call yesterday from the Marines guarding CPA headquarters.  There were two older ladies there who had been there every day for the last month and were harrasing these Marines to death.  (They were demanding to see Paul Bremer.)  So, we roll up to the CPA parking lot.  CPT and I walk to where the Marines are holding these two ladies.  We get the brief about them, that they keep demanding to talk to Bremer and that they would like the women to be escorted outside the Green Zone.  So, CPT and I ask them to stand up and come with us.  The first lady is like 5 feet tall, with her arm in a sling.  (From a car accident a month ago, in which she wasn't hurt.)  CPT takes the lead and asks me to take the trail position.  The second lady is, I kid you not, all of FOUR FOOT FIVE and chinese with big square red glasses on her face.  The Marines decide to walk with us to the vehicles.  Since the first woman could walk pretty good, they soon pulled ahead.  So, picture this in your mind.  2 heavily armed marines and two soldiers (one of which was me) in full battle rattle escorting this FOUR FOOT FIVE Tall old lady down the sidewalk in front of the CPA and she's walking slower than I can low crawl.  Every CPA official walking by was ROLLING.  These two Brits come up behind us and one says "Make sure she doesn't run away!"  I was just hoping there were no TV cameras.  Although, everyone would be laughing, cause I sure was.   B

      WOW.  Today was the mother of all crazy days.  I had a feeling this morning that it was going to be another one of those days.  Especially when I found out that the IGC was going to be choosing a president and prime minister to run the country until elections in January.  So, that being said, we rolled out to our normal "meet the community" day and there was about half as many people.  I turned to the gunner and commented on the bad omen this was.  Sure enough, as we're driving from the community center. BOOM! BOOM!  One was close and right behind us.  So we turned around and drove to the impact site.  No damage cause it hit in an empty piece of dirt but the shrapnel went everywhere.  So, I do my crater analysis piece (more on that when I get around to telling ya'll what I do here), take some pics and entertain some special forces guys who heard the blast and want to sightsee.  About half-an-hour passes and I get back in the truck to continue our mission. Both the CPT and I are sitting in the truck with our Kevlars off trying to cool down in the heat when we hear the sky torn apart.  RIIIIIIP!  We both just look at each other and scramble for our kevlars.   BOOM!  BOOM!  He throws the car into gear and squeels the tires getting to the impact.  We get the grid and realize that the impact is in the middle of a housing complex (the KDP, Kurdistan Diplomatic Party).  We turn onto the street into a tornado of activity.  People are running everywhere.  Screaming.  Crying.  Shouting.  I grab the radio to call it in as the CPT sprints to the scene.  Wounded he yells.  I call up the information to my fire support guys.  Realizing I'm sounding just a tad bit too freaked, I take a deep breath to calmly call it in.  At least 4 KIA, mulitples wounded.  Main copies and askes if we need medical support.  I tell them no because the Kurds are throwing people in their silver SUVs and hauling butt to the Combat Support Hospital.  About 4 SUVs speed off with lots wounded.  After they clear out, I run over to the house and go inside to asses the damage and make sure there's no UXO in the house.  I couldn't believe the damage.  It ripped part of the roof off of the building and just decimated the room.  Ensuring everyone left was okay, I ran back downstairs to the truck.  Taking a deep breath and lots of water, my heart slowly returned to normal.  Hearing that the other boom is close to where we are, we drive towards the reported location.  Luckily, this one hit a building no one was in and there aren't any casualties.  Hot as all get out, I'm downing as much water as I can without getting sick.  Taking a pause, we sit on the side of the road waiting for everything to get cleared up.  After about 15 minutes, we turn around and start moving towards our checkpoint.  We're driving on the road leading right to the checkpoint when  BOOM!  and the whole HUMVEE shakes.  I look up the road and all i see is this massive cloud of smoke rising up from past the checkpoint.  I know immediately that it's a VBIED (vehicle borne improvised explosive device) and that lots of people are very hurt.  The driver floors the gas to get to the checkpoint.  Rolling up, we hear tons of small arms fire, about 500 meters in front of us.  Sounds just like a firefight.  I jump into the tower to see what's going on and see a burning building but not much else.  I look around for a while, and decide to go back to the ground to see what else is going on.  The VBIED is outside of our sector, so we can't really do much about it but listen to the radio.  Lots of reports coming in, all pretty bad.  Luckily though, no American soldiers hurt in any of the blasts.  What a crazy day.  That's a really long post so I'll leave it at that.  I hope it all makes sense, if something doesn't, just post a comment and I'll clarify.  To reiterate, no Americans were hurt today and I am safe and sound.  But I think I definitely earned my combat patch today.  I think, in some ways, I'd rather be in a direct firefight instead of having rockets falling all around me.  Anyway, we'll see what fun things tomorrow brings.   Black Knight 14 out!

      A day or so ago, I recieved an update about my new job here.&nbsp; A lot of us are due to switch out and this is a part of the whole "officer career progression" ensuring that as soon as an officer gets good at his job, he gets moved.&nbsp; Lol.&nbsp; Anyway, most probably I will be going back to 2-82 FA to be an FDO.&nbsp; For those who haven't been paying attention to my mini lectures, that's a Fire Direction Officer.&nbsp; He is charge of the brains of the gun battery.&nbsp; It's not the job I wanted, but it's a stepping stone to get to a Platoon Leader job.&nbsp; The overwhelmingly good thing is that I'll most likely be working for the CPT who is my current boss.&nbsp; (Not the company commander, but the Task Force FSO, who I get along with extremely well.&nbsp; There are some downsides, like he knows me and what I'm capable of, which means I'll never be able to get away with anything, but, that'll be good.&nbsp; The good things are that I know how he thinks and what he expects, so there won't be the normal confusion that comes with having a brand new boss.&nbsp; So, I'm pretty excited.)&nbsp; It looks like the switch will come sometime in mid-October when the senior first lieutenants become Captains and have to move out of their current jobs.&nbsp; I'll definitely be glad to move, for reasons I can't really discuss using this forum.&nbsp; And the other really cool thing is that we are probably going to be able to shoot our guns to qualify while we're here.&nbsp; I can't wait to hear the sounds of friendly artillery.&nbsp; Well, that's about all that's going on here.&nbsp; It's been fairly quiet here this morning.&nbsp; Well, except for 6 mortar rounds that impacted in the International Zone.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I didn't even wake up for them.&nbsp; I must be getting used to this.........&nbsp;&nbsp; B

       I think there's something in the air over here driving people out of their minds.&nbsp; We've had a division sergeant major relieved, a division commander relieved, 3 battalion commanders relieved, and untold others moved since we've gotten here.&nbsp; There is something about this situation that has caused a crazy amount of stupidity.&nbsp; Doing things that are just DUMB.&nbsp; I can't really go into it, but things that they should KNOW better.&nbsp; I mean, some of these people have spent 20+ YEARS in the army.&nbsp; They should know better by now.   Not to say that the stupidity factor isn't already high (Donk, I know you can back me up on this one) but man, what were they thinking?&nbsp; I'm just amazed.&nbsp; Behavior you would expect out of some private with no more sense then a concrete block.&nbsp; Absolutely amazing.&nbsp;    And for a great example of the normal level of stupidity.&nbsp; (We were talking today and if they made a movie of things over here, no one would believe it.)&nbsp; An Iranian National came to the checkpoint with information about nuclear weapons in Iran.&nbsp; But he only spoke Farsi, which has some Arabic elements to it.&nbsp; So, we could kind of tell what he was saying.&nbsp; He wanted to give us the information but also to surrender to the United States Government here.&nbsp; Guidance from higher said to take his statement and hold him there.&nbsp; As long as possible.&nbsp; So, I ask, why do we want to hold him after he gives his statement?&nbsp; Higher says, cause we're trying to find someone that speaks Farsi.&nbsp; Ok, makes sense.&nbsp; BUT HE WANTS TO SURRENDER.&nbsp; Give himself up.&nbsp; And we're just messing around.&nbsp; I even asked about the State Department getting involved and got told to stay in my lane, dumb lieutenant.&nbsp;  &nbsp; And yes, we are the greatest army in the world.&nbsp; And no, I have no idea how.&nbsp; B

      For those of ya'll who have caught the news today, a pretty massive vehicle borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) exploded at the checkpoint my unit is responsible for.  No Americans were killed and only one slightly injured but we lost 2 of our fellow Iraq brothers in arms.  They gave their life in the ultimate sacrifice for their country.  There are very few acts more noble than that.  They will be buried with honors as if they were one of us.   As for me, I'm exhausted after spending all day on the checkpoint and am going to get a shower and some much needed rest.  (It was 127 degrees today.)  Hopefully tomorrow will be quiet and we can all get back to work.  B

      Part of being a Fire Support Officer is getting attached to a manuever company.  In my case, I am attached to a Tank company.  When we first got here, they did not have any tanks, it wasn't believed that they would need them in the Green Zone.  The higher powers that be decided we needed tanks, so they shipped them FedEx from Fort Hood.  Now that they are here, they have to be outfitted with all their proper gear, including tank main gun rounds.  This is where I come in.  I really am a wannabe tanker.  It was my first choice for a branch (Armor) and something I always wanted to do.  We were short on manpower yesterday, and so I was asked to help load main gun rounds.  The round is about 100 pounds and 2.5 feet long.  Not too heavy at first, but carrying and then lifting them onto the tank sure gives you a nice workout.  (Yes, I am sore.)  Also, add to that, it was around 120 degrees outside when we were doing this.  Quite the workout.   AND while we were out there, the Captain walked by and said to me "THIS is outside.  Trees, sun, sky."  I couldn't believe he busted me out like that, ESPECIALLY cause the reason I spend so much time inside is that I'm STILL making badges for HIM.     I guess no matter where I go, I'll end up being a computer doing something.  It's my lot in life.  ;-)  Which is perfectly okay, I like A/C.  B

      So, I really have nothing much to talk about or discuss.  It's been really quiet here lately but the tension everyone was feeling is gone.  I think everyone is starting to hope that things really have calmed down and the Iraqis can go about rebuilding the rest of their country.  I have to say, today was just about the hottest day since I've been here.  We sat outside for about an hour and I was TOTALLY soaked by the time we got back.  It was insane how hot it was.   Somewhat funny story for ya'll.  The uparmored suburban rolls into the Green Zone (just about the safest place in Iraq) and stops just past the gate (inside the GZ).  They all get out, wearing just DCUs, and move to the back of the truck.  Opening the hatch, they pull out their OTVs and Kevlars, put them on, get back in the truck, and drive away.  Someone tell me what sense that makes?  Driving around the red zone with no protection, but put it on when they get in the GZ.

      Happy Fourth of July!!!  Woo hoo!  As much as I wish I were back in the States standing over grill cooking up some sweet steaks, I can't help but think it's pretty cool to be in Iraq today.  I keep thinking of that scene in the Great Escape where the Americans celebrate the 4th in the midst of the British inside a German POW camp.  Not that I think that I'm in some sort of prision camp (well, maybe a little), the parallels are still there.  Supposedly they are roasting several goats and a pig for a semi-party tonight.  I hope I get to attend that shin-dig.  As for Baghdad and the International Zone (someone decided that the term "Green Zone" connotated that there are different areas of safety in Baghdad and could be offensive  ), it's been rather quiet.  I hope that the bad guys don't decided to launch fireworks of their own tonight.  That sure would put a damper on things.  And maybe they'll even launch the million dollars (yeah, they bought a million dollars worth of fireworks) worth of fireworks tonight.  That would be quite a show, especially since every Iraqi with an AK would slap in a mag of tracers and let em fly.  Lol.  I hope everyone enjoys their Fourth and remembers to eat a couple steaks and throw down some beer for the troopers over here in Iraq.  B

      It is now the second of JULY (thanks, Dad) and it's another quiet day here in the Green Zone.  I didn't wake up to explosions or gunfire.  I never thought I'd say this, but this quiet is kind of disconcerting.  It looks like we're preparing to resume normal operations and it seems that this is a year 2000-ish bust.  I'd hate to be wrong, but I'm hoping more now that ever that this quiet will be sustained.  The going theory is that everyone is waiting to see what this new government does with it's newfound power.  I, along with everyone else, am hoping that they do the right things and get this country back on its feet.  They have all the tools, including HUGE oil resources.  (I wonder sometimes how much oil I'm sitting on right now.)  If we can keep the bad guys at bay long enough, Iraq could really come out of this way ahead. Anyone being reading/hearing about Saddam Hussain's trial?  Yeah, it makes for some pretty interesting and funny reading.  The asked him what his name was, for the record, and he said "Saddam Hussain, President of Iraq."  Lol.  He claims he is the rightfully democratically elected president of this country.  Riiiiiiiight.  The article I read says that the tenant of his defense is that under Iraqi law, the president cannot be deposed by an illegal invasion.  Hmmm, I wonder who wrote that law?  And what would be a legal invasion?  (I think you could call America's current infestation with lawyers a legal invasion. :-) )  Saddam Hussain is going to go down hard and protesting the whole time.  One of the Iraqis interviewed said they should burn him alive, and let dogs loose on him.  Ouch.  Another said they should do what he did and kill off his entire family.  (Oops, didn't we already do that?)  I don't think most Iraqis like him very much.  And as long as the ones who do keep strapping bombs to themselves, that problems should be dealt with soon enough.  Anyways, time for chow.  Later.  B

      Sorry for not posting in so long.  I've kinda been in a funk lately and haven't felt like doing much of anything.  I am doing pretty well, on the whole.  Had a mistaken report today that my replacement was here.  Kind of a shock/suprise that I'll really be moving soon to a new job.  Lots of things happening in Iraq, for those who've been keeping up with the news (I'll detail them later for those who don't ;-) ).  In the last 4 days there've been over 20 mortar/rocket attacks in the Green Zone, so it's been pretty crazy.  Hopefully, I'll get on later tonight and let you know more about what's going on over here.  Brian
