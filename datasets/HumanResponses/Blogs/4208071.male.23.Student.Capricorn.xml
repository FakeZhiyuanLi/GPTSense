      Well the last couple of days have been hell.  Ive been so sick that I missed work and school for 2 days and I had to cancel my time with my daughter this weekend.  That really sucks cause I miss her so much and I just wanted to spend some time with her.   I almost feel well enough to get out of the house for a while.  Maybe I'll go rent me a movie or something... Somebody might be comming over later, I could definately use some tlc.  So I get a call from my best friend the other night and he sounds all shooken up over something.  Turns out some jerks at the bar started some crap with him and another friend of mine and there were some punches thrown.  Not only that they did something to his truck.  Now I'm no fighter by any means and I definately dont like to start crap.  But when somebody messes with one of my friends it just goes all over me.  I swear if we ever see these guys again, and I know we will, I dont know whats going to happen but its not going to be good.

      Went out with my friend last night. Hadnt seen him in a few weeks since we've both been so busy. Nothing special really. Just had a few beers and what not. I started to feel sick last night and I still got that feeling like something is comming on...I hope its nothing and just goes away. I cant really afford to miss work or school.  So this past week at work has been some what interesting. I walk thru the halls here all the time and it always seems like someone catches my eye or maybe I catch theres..The thing is Im always right in the middle of something so it would be kinda hard to 'holla holla' at one of these girls. I feel like crap today so I dont even really care to much to look at anything much less talk..but I'll get my chance here sooner or later. I swear some of these girls in here are just gorgeous..Im like what are you doing at a votech looking like that? Who knows. Think I'll go home after work today and curl up in my bed. later peoples.  tip- Seriously, if she's givin ya a handjob or BJ and attempts to give you the reacharound because cosmo said it will make your orgasm better, let her do it. Cosmo is right. And seriously, for all you guys that are insecure about your sexuality... a finger up your butt doesn't make you ***... unless that finger belongs to another guy.

      Yes, I know I drive the world's crappiest car. I know that the sight of a 20 foot long olds hurtling down Harrison with Ludacris blaring from the barely functioning stereo might appear strange. Look, I don't like it either. Im not a big fan off of driving around town with no air conditioning and no driver side window I might add, while I try to hide my face behind the steering wheel. I also dont like the fact that half of the steering wheel mysteriously peeled off on my way to work last week.  I hate the fact that there's a huge crack in the windshield, and every time I see it I am reminded of a big fat lady thats fallen over, what the?? Dont ask. I dont really like the fact that the car smells like wet dog, even though I don't have a dog? The fact that my cd player will only play a whole 2 cds that I own pretty much sucks as well.  Thats right 2 cds.  One is a ginuwine cd and the other is a burnt cd I made a long time ago.  Why it wont play anything else is a mystery to me. And, you know what makes all of this a million times worse? IT'S NOT EVEN MY CAR. Thats right. Its my dads old beater that im stuck with for the time being. Cant even call that bad boy my own. Meh whatever, Im just bitchin..I still pimp around in style dang it...in my own mind anyways. Maybe one day ill fix it up when I'm rich.  tip- She's not going to orgasm every time... Don't get down on yourself if she doesn't. If she doesn't orgasm from sex, offer to do oral. If she doesn't orgasm from that either, offer to let her masturbate and show you how to touch her. If she doesn't orgasm from that, then you might wanna give up. If a girl can't get herself off, then odds are, you can't get her off either

      Two hairy short-haired middle aged women, in dirty, masculine clothing arguing with each other in a book shop. "Put it back, I'm not buying that crap again" "Shut up, you always do this!!"  XD!  Another Monday over with thank god.. Not a whole lot of new stuff goin on so maybe some more bs later.  Tip-Your girl can't give a handjob to save her life? She doesn't know the right pressure, motion, or movement?  Well... TEACH HER!!! Lay down and take her hand... wrap your hand around hers and start fapping... Loosen your grip to see if she has the hang of it, and if she doesn't, tighten your grip and take control again. This is really a lot easier than trying to explain things to her, and it gives her some "hands" on experience.

      Just wanted to say thanks to a special someone that stayed the night with me last night.  I had alot of fun and I'm sure you did to.  Talk to ya soon.  So the weekend is almost over and its back to work tommorrow.. yipee..  tip-Does your girl want to swallow for you (because she loves you... awwwww...) but the taste of splooge makes her want to vomit? Well... she's doing it all wrong. The fact is that many women don't like the taste of splooge and the only place they've learned how to swallow from is watching all that porn you think you have stashed away so well in your computer... So give her this advice... tell her when you're about to ***, you'll give her some sort of warning sign... like a tap on the head or a prolonged yelling of the word "KHAAAAAAAAHNNNNNN!!!!". This is her sign to take you as far into her throat as possible without her tripping her gag reflex and not stop sucking until you're dry. Most of the splooge taste will be bypassed since you're squirting down the back of her throat. This technique takes a little practice, but I'm sure you guys don't mind that.  I gotta go for now but ill post again later.  Oh heres another Vida pic up top.

      2 words. Vida Guerra.  This girls got a booty that would make any mans day. Some say shes the next Jennifer Lopez...I say she needs come over to my place. I'll let the picture speak for itself. Shes the second from the right in the above picture.  So I went out drinkin with a buddy last night..Had a pretty good time. I tried a few new drinks that ive never tried before. One was called the buttery nipple. Its butterscotch snapps and bailey's irish creme. Not to bad. I was pretty trashed once the night was over. I guess Sam really can drink me under the table...We'll see what happens next time.  Guess I'm taking it easy tonight.  sex tip- Don't light her hair on fire. You might think it's funny, but she sure as hell won't! just kiddin. WEAR A ****ING CONDOM!!!! It is your responsibility to protect yourself from everything that's out there... even if she says she's on the pill, if you two aren't in a serious commited relationship with a lot of understanding and trust, do NOT go out without your hat on. You have to protect yourself.  peace.

      Heres a few thoughts about Nelly's Tip Drill video just because I can.  I got this video from my boy steven (aka porn boy). So thanks for the hook up bro.  You thought a Nelly MTV-friendly video was bootilicious?  Some a these gals have cheek coming a good foot off the haunch. After the first few versus's you'll quickly see why calling a girl 'tip drill' is both a compliment and a cut down at the same time. The St. Lunatics(I asume thats who they are), and Jermaine Dupri get to be a part of this almost porn affair and seem very happy for the opportunity.  Obviously some of these tip drills are dancers â€˜cause the booty control says professional. The gal with the leg behind her head needs my number. And when Nelly swipes his credit card between two perfectly globular cheeks this whole video has been charged to the game. I give it a 9/10. Definately one my all time favorite videos at this point.   Sex tip of the day- yeah I know I already gave a few earlier but what the hell. Most women do NOT like doggystyle...Tis a shame I know.  Do not request or attempt to flip her over without a prior understanding. Unless shes a tip drill over course!   peace.

      Maybe I'll start posting a tip a day?  It is time for us brothers to join together and share our do's and dont's regarding the wonders of fornication, maybe you youngsters will grow strong in the ways of copulation through this, and we shall eb forever known as kings of the boudoir (or maybe not...).Ever made a mistake you think someone could learn from? Ever pull a wonderful move your fellow man would be glad to take to their present or future bedroom? Figure out any helpful tips that could help up some quick discharges or failed bonarifications? Anybody have any questions that one could not dare ask a friend or family member?Well, maybe this will become the place. I'll start off with two basic tips everyone should know.How to delay teh splooging:1. If you know you're gonna get some action, take the time to spank it that day, your time with your woman (or man...) may double or triple as a result!2. This is a must: Never engage in sexual activity when one has the urge to pee. It will speed you up to an embarrassing length of time. Take the time to pee beforehand.  Fill free to post your on tips and tricks.  Be back later.

      SLAP!! rip Rick!  Well so far so good today.  The parking lot was packed with cars from all the new students starting today.  My oh my theres definately some hotties up in here now.  I've been walking around like a little kid in a candy store drooling all over the place.   So I bought me a new game yesterday.  Its called Breakdown and its for the xbox.  Not a bad game so far. I played it for a few hours yesterday and I got into it.  Im sure ill waste countless hours of my life on the damn thing just like I do all the time.  What can I say, I'm definately a gamer.  Well peace out for now.
