       The Irish Golf Mystique   Some of the Irish courses, I was about to write, stand comparison with the greatest courses in the world. They don't. They are the greatest courses in the world, not only in layout but in scenery and "atmosphere" and that indefinable something which makes you relive again and again the day you played there. - Henry Longhurst    There is, quite simply, no better place to play golf.

       My German Trip  Daniel Libeskind described his design for the Jewish Museum in Berlin as a "deconstructed Star of David," with windows like slashes on the facade.    Turkish: "What's that?"  Tommy: "A gun. For protection."  Turkish: "Against what? Ze Germans???"   (thats from 'snatch' and if you havent seen snatch(one of me fav movies) u shudnt be talkin to me..'tis a guy ritchie film..  ah rite..anyway..the moral of the story is that u dont have to fear ze germans and ze germans do have a sense of humour unlike many of u think....  I spent easter in Frankfurt.with rajan uncle ], noey aunty , roji and rita.They're friends of ours from India. Also visited Dusseldorf and Cologne(they call it Koln). Fabulous cities..Been to FRA before but Cologne and Dusseldorf, were new to me and boy were they beautiful?

      My First DIY job  Can you beleive it that I never knew that DIY meant do it yourself? I said something like 'lets get someone in, to get this DIY job done :) Yes I did and I think it was at the office and remember flick or someone bursting out laughing...Anyway..laugh no more coz I did my first DIY job (yes..all by myself). I made a rack for my DVDs..bought this thing from argos over the weekend..I had the jeep with me so luckily was able to fit this and another DIY wardrobe(god knows how i'm gonna manage that one now) and bring them all home. Anyway..today I'm the proud ownder of a 'New York Case cabinet' made by Mr George Thomas! (argos actually..but I'm in the advertising business..why not ..eh? )  Here's a picture of me on the job..(pssst....think i was drinking on the job..hope thats ok)..and there's the finished product :

       urlLink  Meanwhile | 'The Passion': great marketing, lousy movie   Completely agree with this article..havent seen a movie lately that has been so hyped and with so little substance in it. Nothing but a load of  gory violence. I'm amazed that the movie escaped with a 15 cert in Ireland. Promoting christianity is one thing, I'd support that any day, but a movie with flesh being torn apart forming the highlight of 2 hours of screenplay can never be classified as something good. Anti jewish sentiments are supported at a time when innocent jews are getting blow up on the streets of Jerusalem...

       The 200th anniversary of the Grand Canal     Some 50 or so boats sailed down the Canal last week, past my apt and docked at the newly constructed jetty beside The Malt House, where ICAN is located. The Grand Canal crosses Leinster from Dublin to the river Shannon in Offaly, with a branch south to the River Barrow. It gives access to some wonderful fishing and ecology and wildlife abound. Worth a trip.

       Comedy Club at the International Bar   Keith(Lizzie's boyfriend) was doing this comedy gig at the International Bar last night. He apparently does it every thursdays and Saturdays. Solicitor/Comedian. Jeez thats some act eh? What? Can't solicitors be funny? Ah well...there was this  solicitor who was opening the door of his BMW, when suddenly a car came along and hit the door, ripping it off completely. When the police arrived at the scene, the solicitor was complaining bitterly about the damage to his precious BMW. "Officer, look what they've done to my Beeeemer!!!", he whined. "You solicitors are so materialistic, you make me sick!!!" retorted the officer, "You're so worried about your stupid BMW, that you didn't even notice that your arm was ripped off!!!" "OH MYYY.....", replied the solicitor, finally noticing the bloody right shoulder where his arm once was, "MY ROLEX???!!!!!"  Good show it was anyway. Ended up in 'spy' afterwards. Of forgot- went ot a lebanese restaurant before that. Was ok..I've been to the real thing..That's probably why I didn't think it was like the best! Anyway, I'm not on top of the world today as you can imagine.:)

       The Day after the Indian Elections     So what do they Irish papers say this morning about it? Ireland and India have always had a very strong connection especially with the nehru/gandhi family. Nehru (India's first primeminister) went to college at Trinity in Cambridge and acquainted himself with the Irish Republican Movement on a holiday to Dublin in 1907. And thus my connections :) Just joking. But have you not seen my picture with  urlLink Gerry Adams?    Anyway, Main news on the Times and Indo were Sonia Gandhi and the congress party's emphatic win over the Hindu Nationalists, BJP. Good picture for India and for a new global society I say. Why can't she be PM just because she was born in Italy? Eamonn de Valera (Ireland's first Presient) was born in America to a spanish father and an Irish mother! What makes you part of a nation anyway? Is it birth? Ancestry? Passport? Language? Culture?

Twas a pretty good weekend...Spend Saturday night at this Farm in a village called  urlLink Rathdrum,  which is 36 miles south of Dublin, once claimed to be the capital of County Wicklow.   urlLink Dave  (Ian's Brother) lives in this cool farmhouse,(pics below)..where we had a BBQ with live music from bands including Twisted melon. Even witnessed a Toyota Corrolla being auctioned - got sold for € 70! :) Loughlin did a bit of DJing . Was pretty impressive. Twisted melon was good as ever! bouncing castle, huge bonfire, chagrilled steaks...ehmmm...wouldnt mind doing it all again.  Isn't this a cool pic?

       Galway Trip   Boy, what fun! Last weekend was quite fun filled with a mad party weekend in galway, followed by a refreshing trip to the arann islands. The drive down to Galway took over 5 hours with the bank holiday traffic making the start a bit of a pain but saturday night did make up for it. The quays in galway was packed with people..packed liked sardines would be a correct usage, although I have to admit that I've never seen sardines being packed. Who would want to pack or see sardines being packed? Yuck! the smell of them!!    Anyway, here are some pictures from Arann Islands and Galway. Boy the view from the cliffs were fabulous!     The rest of the snaps will hopefully be up soon. I'm having quite a busy week here. No time to do any allied activities :)

      So how do you like the ads on my site? eh? :) I know ads are annoying at times, but it pays for my mortgage, my car, my rice and you know I dont drink or do anything unwanted, if i did , advertising would've paid for that too ;) Anyway, this is a new format I'm trying to get the Irish sites to take..Well..better than popups aren't they?

          Ok..whats that? Is it a fruit, a flower or a vegetable? Ehm..good question..The answer is that I've no idea whatsover it is..Was at a friend's farm over the weekend and while there was still light (both outside and inside my brain) I took some vague pictures. Here's one of them. Beautiful location. I'd like to live in a farmhouse as well..Looks cool..It's really out of this world man...Anyway...Whats the point of rambling on about living in a farm or something..U and I know for a fact that I'm not going to do that anytime soon..Maybe I'll get hooked up with a farm girl ..Ehm...wonder if they're nice people...Does a farm girl mean a farm owner or a farm worker...?

        Rathlin 2004       Once upon a time, over 2,000 people from all over Ireland descended onto an island on the northeastern coast of the Island. This Island was nearly 7-8 miles long and less than a mile in length. Folklore has it that people came by boatloads from as far as Mongolia! (yeah man..) And these people partied and partied till their legs turned to jelly and they all became jellyfish...    Before they all got transformed..we managed to get a few pictures...           Disclaimer: This picture has nothing to do with rathlin. This is in fact Thailand! :)    'Twas mad...the people we met..We actually met 'Jim-Jim'! (Jim-Jim was a code word the lads use for practically anything and imagine our shock when this guy says - People call me Jim-Jim?) Loads of people..I met this Indian girl from London..whose name I can't remember and I wasn't sure if it was her, with us on the bus the next day...Ah well...  Also met this guy..who was really big..He was in the shrimping business...His mama cooked shrimp. And her mama before her cooked shrimp,And her mama before her mama cooked shrimp, too. His family knew everything there was to know about the shrimping business.Now, I know everything there is to know about the shrimping business .  Enough of my rambling.. urlLink check the pictures out  >> from Alan's, Lara's and my collection .
