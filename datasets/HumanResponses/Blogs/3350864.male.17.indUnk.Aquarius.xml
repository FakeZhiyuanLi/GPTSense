      Ways To Turn Men Down HE: Can I buy you a drink?  SHE: Actually I'd rather have the money.   HE: I'm a photographer. I've been looking for a face like yours.  SHE: I'm a plastic surgeon. I've been looking for a face like yours.   HE: Hi. Didn't we go on a date once? Or was it twice?  SHE: Must've been once. I never make the same mistake twice.   HE: How did you get to be so beautiful?  SHE: I must've been given your share.   HE: Will you go out with me this Saturday?  SHE: Sorry. I'm having a headache this weekend.   HE: Your face must turn a few heads.  SHE: And your face must turn a few stomachs.   HE: Go on, don't be shy. Ask me out.  SHE: Okay, get out.   HE: I think I could make you very happy.  SHE: Why? Are you leaving?   HE: What would you say if I asked you to marry me?  SHE: Nothing. I can't talk and laugh at the same time.   HE: Can I have your name?  SHE: Why? Don't you already have one?   HE: Shall we go see a movie?  SHE: I've already seen it.   HE: Where have you been all my life?  SHE: Hiding from you.   HE: Haven't I seen you some place before?  SHE: Yes. That's why I don't go there anymore.   HE: Is this seat empty?  SHE: Yes, and this one will be if you sit down.   HE: So, what do you do for a living?  SHE: I'm a female impersonator.   HE: Hey baby, what's your sign?  SHE: Do not enter.   HE: Your body is like a temple.  SHE: Sorry, there are no services today.   HE: If I could see you naked, I'd die happy.  SHE: If I saw you naked, I'd probably die laughing.   HE: Where have you been all my life?  SHE: Where I'll be the rest of your life - in your wildest dreams.  extracted from www.toilet.com
