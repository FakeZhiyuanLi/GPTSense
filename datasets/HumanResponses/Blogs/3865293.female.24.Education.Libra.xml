           As I enter my third year teaching at Independence High School, I have various technology experiences, but nothing extensive.  I love technology, but take little initiative to learn about new programs available.  I hope to learn enough to show my students how to use the internet in ways other than social communication and interest surfing.  I also hope to incorporate what I learn in EIST 5100 in my classroom.        Much like the students mentioned in "Net-Wise Teens: Safety, Ethics, and Innovation" my students have their favorite web-sites.  Collectively they particularly enjoy browsing the inmate list on the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sheriff's Department web page, NFL.com, and any celebrity site they can find.  With only one computer in my classroom, it is particularly difficult to integrate technology as much as I would like.      Upon completion of EIST 5100 I plan to design a class web page that will consist of my schedule, a homework page, and upcoming school and class events.  Now that I am learning how to design a free web page, I will help my students design a homepage of their own where they can post responses to readings and assignments.  I am excited to brush up on my computer skills!

      Response to "Learning To Be Wired" by Bob Thompson  So many times in schools educators have a new tool that they are expected to use in their classrooms that are supposed to enhance student learning. Some teachers are receptive, while others never open the boxes. Using computers in classrooms is a valuable learning supplement only if treated that way. Thompson's "Learning to be Wired" points out the importance of content in education. The use of computers can enhance student performance if there is a strict plan of action teachers plan to follow. It is not in the best interest of education for me to assign students to create a PowerPoint presentation about their favorite things. There is no real challenge in the activity. Technology in classrooms is only valuable if content area is emphasized first. In order for computer usage to benefit students, teachers must plan their activities very carefully. They must set forth specific content expectations and place little emphasis on elements such as appearance and graphics until the expectations are met. Students will easily get caught up in putting flashing and flaming letters in their name as opposed to researching the Vietnam War unless teachers are clear on the purpose of the assignment. Curriculum guidelines must be set prior to booting up the computer. How can computers help access and demonstrate information should be the primary question asked regarding technology in the classrooms. Planning and organizing computer activities that are worth while take a lot of time, but will stretch even further.

      Upon reading Christina Pino-Marina's "Not My Father's Shop Class", I feel encouraged about the future of many students. Having attended school in Fairfax County, I recall a strong emphasis on vocational education in Fairfax County Public Schools. Pino-Marina is emphasizing the importance of being a well-rounded student in the technological age. No longer is being a good student enough. Students must also have valuable skills and experience in order to succeed. Vocational and trade education did originally start as a place for students that were not academically as strong as other students. Pino-Marina emphasizes that now there is a cross-over between vocational education and advanced placement (AP) courses. Not only are AP students participating in trade education, but other students on other academic levels are beginning to excel in their core classes as well, and even attending college. Mamadou Nanine shares his first experience in American public education as a non-native speaker. After his struggle, he has earned a $33,000 annual scholarship to Connecticut College. As "shop class" is now known as "fundamentals of technology", we are submerged in the technological age. Public schools are responding to the need for technical education in a way that is fostering success for all students and preparing them for a better quality of life.
