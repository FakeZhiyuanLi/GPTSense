      Everything that's economily scarce has its price. Salary is the price for work. Money is the price for goods. Interest is the price for money. I think our commercial society has finally figured out the price for a human being. Propaganda.  Why do I write this? Yesterday I heard that my favourite radiochannel was probably to be kicked off the radio soon. The radiochannel I'm talking about, Kink FM, is in Holland the only channel that only plays modern alternative music. The only other channel who did that before as well is getting more and more mainstream. Why must Kink FM be kicked off the radio? Because they don't make enough money. They could better be swapped with yet another your-favorite-hits-channel. Another reason is the fact they play alternative music. Marketeers would find it great if alternative music was to be banned. Because then everybody will have to listen to mainstream music at some point. Then everybody will be a mindless zombie when it comes to music. They have turned half of the world already into hilary duff/britney spears/usher fans, the rest of the world will have to suffer that at some point as well.  There is something else about alternative music. It's free. It has a mind of its own. It breathes freedom. People who listen to it and appreciate it are likely to avoid the propaganda of the world. (listen to free*land - we want your soul) Commercial organisations don't want that. They want to have the opportunity to make everything EXTREME, everything has to be SUPER COOL and FANTASTIC. Because mindless zombies will get exited if they hear that the EXTREME, SUPER COOL AND FANTASTIC new hit-single of Aeger Avarus is available in stores NOW! But when they hear that the new single by Aeger Avarus is released they couldn't care less.  Back to more general, abstract terms. I have probably quoted fight club before about marketeers. "Marketeers makes us work jobs we don't want to buy shit we don't need." This is exactly my point. If it were up to marketeers we wouldn't have thoughts anymore. Marketeers are trying to make everything as futuristic as possible but at the same moment they want to pull back time 20 years. If it was up to me most marketeers could join the line behind mainstream music fans to talk to Pluto (people with the name Orpheus who like mainstream music can come for a nice talk to me). They make me sick. So tell em, dear marketeer, how many advertisements buy a human being?

      Ok, I'm pissed off at the moment. I was asked by a friend to write some weekly piece about music. Ofcourse I accepted it with only one condition: I shall not be censured! He accepted my commands and the day after I wrote my first piece.   A week later I write my second piece, post it and watch if it is shown correct. But what does my eye spot? Censure. Correction: stupidly censured words. I asked him about it and he told me that he had made a list of words that were automatically censured. My blood is still boiling. When I read that, I knew that I should resign. Haven't done that yet though, will find out ways to insult people and judge shitty music without being censured. What I will do now is explain why censurement sucks.  There are different types of censurement. A summarisation follows: * Stupid censurement Removing words like shit and fuck makes people ignorant. Have you ever used the word fuck? I bet you did. Have you heard stories of people dying after they heard/read the word fuck? The only people who are against the use of those words are overconcerned parents and overprotected kids. The parents of those kids are criminals for puting such stupid kids in society. Your kid won't become a murderer after he has learned some cuss-words. As a matter of fact, if you allow them to use cuss words from a young age they won't be using cuss-words a lot at a later age. Just because they are familiar with them. They're not new to them. Those words just are. In my opinion words as 'shitty' and 'fucking' are perfect adjectives which should be allowed everywhere. Ofcourse, those adjectives don't say anything usefull about something but they can give somebody's opinion about something. If I talk about 'shitty music like Britney's music' I don't feel I have to explain why I hate Britney's music. At that moment I think it's enough to let people know I don't like Britney's music. And that's the way to do it.  * Stupid censurement: E.g. Fuck - F*ck This is the type of censure that was used on my article. F*ck is in no way less offensive than the real word (I believe Maddox used the exact same sentance but I don't care(or Zappa did)). I mean, if you want to protect six year old kids this definatly ain't the way to do it. Fuckers who are stupid enough to censure my fucking texts this shitty way are fucking ignorant wankers.  * Stupid censurement: MTV's censurement.  This is probably the worst censurement. The way MTV censures is terrible. I don't like MTV's music but I do like to watch to shows like alternative nation (though that isn't broadcasted anymore) and top 11 @ 11. But that's not what I was talking about. My problem with MTV is that they censure everything. In the USA MTV banned the video of Incubus' Megalomaniac to the evening hours because of...yeah because of what exactly? Because of images of Hitler? Are we on our way back to 1984 that much that we are trying to forget about Hitler?  Another example: junior/senior - everybody (I believe that was the title, not completely sure. I'm too perfect to know much about those shitty songs) Some squirrel drank four glasses of something fast. After that he was shown drunk. What does MTV add? "Non-alcoholic nut-juice". I guess that's what those dipshits at MTV drink. Nut-juice. Otherwise you wouldn't get as insane as those cows. Third and last example: Madonna - Die another day: She was cut with a sword in the video along with this crappy song. MTV censured the blood out. Good example for the kids you're trying to protect. Go slash eachother open. You won't bleed. MTV shows you you won't bleed. Didn't you see?  Related to this subject is the pron rock scandal. From Frank Zappa's response to that: They lived on a whole bunch of nothing They thought they looked very good They'd never ever worry They were always in a hurry To convince themselves that what they were Was really very groovy Yes, they believed in all the papers And the magazines that defined their folklore They could never laugh At who or what they thought they were Or even what they thought They sorta oughta be They were totally empty (Totally empty) And their lives were really useless So what the fuck? They didn't have no sense of humor

      OK, I'm pissed off about this. Apart from the usual junk channels broadcast nowadays there is a new type of shitty programs broadcasted. VERY shitty programs.  I am talking about extreme celebrity make-over... First there was extreme make-over. That sucked. I'll tell you why.  Women: - I am fat. I ate too much now i gained weight. I didn't know eating a bag of ships each day made me fat but thanks to these geniusses I now have a healthy body again and I won't eat chips anymore. From now on I follow a healthy diet. I order the healthiest hamburgers at McDonalds from now on... Thank you Extreme make-over. (see foamy on www.illwillpress.com for a nice piece about diets)  - My teeth are rotton. Since I'm six years old I haven't brushed my teeth. When I was 17 I wanted to kiss a boy but when I opened my mouth he fainted. How could I have known that you have to brush your teeth. Thanks to my hero's of extreme make-over I now have healthy teeth again. I have now bought a toothbrush together with soem water my teeth will look good as new for ever and ever.  - My boobs are too small. I really need to get them liften because otherwise boys won't notice me because I don't look like a slut and if I don't look like a slut then I am not interesting to anybody because I am a stupid, ignorant shitty person. Thanks to my friends of extreme make-over I know have such tits that I have a hard time walking up straight.  Men: - Teeth, see above  - Hair. My hair looks like Chad Bixler's hair. People see that that type of hair sucks. Because I'm a mindless zombie I totally agree. Thanks to those metrosexual guys from extreme make-over I now have some slick hair-do which ofcourse will stay this way forever. Thank you people...  - Weight, see above  Now there's something worse. Turning yourself into a celebrity. Do you really think that looking like a celebrity makes you less the dipshit than you really are? Those celebrities would probably puke if they saw you because they don't like their fans. They're only good to be kept in the spotlight.   They want a perfect body, don't want a perfect soul. They want us to notice, when they're not around. They which they were special, though they are not special...

      A quote from the titles of the chapters of the latest state of the union speech by George Bush:  Making America Safer with Decisive Action to Win the War on Terror  Response of most Americans: Yeah, Go Bush, fuck those terrorist pussies up. Response of the other Americans: Bush, focus on our economic state. A lot of people live in poverty, do something about it. Response of Hippies: Make peace not love, nono wait, I'm screwing up...Shit, I forgot, I'm too stoned to remember our ideals. Response of foreign (non-American) Bush-haters: Look what he says, down with Bush. My response: Didn't I read almost the exact same line in 1984? (for the stupid people, that's a book)  Really, in 1984 George Orwell wrote about 'the party' who controlled 33% of the world and who kept the proletarions quiet by letting them hate the other two country's. They needed to think they were in the best country in the world.  The war could never be won, it was only necessary to keep the people calm. Back to Bush. Bush can never win the war against terrorism (and I don't mean that he's a criminal himself, he is, but we'll just ignore it). But as long as he keeps capturing potential treats the people will stay silent. When all the real dangers are gone he just creates them. For instance the fictional weapons of mass-destruction. The only weapon of mass-destruction is the TV. Or well, that's more of a weapon of mass-hypnosis. Come on, come on, into 1984...

      (stupid cow) - Hello, I'm a fashion victim. I buy expensive clothing I usually don't even like just because other people say it's the current fashion. I don't have a mind on my own so I'll just buy what other people tell me to buy.  (Herr toecrusher) * You know what cow. You're stupid. Buying expensive clothing because it's the current fashion is a perfect example why the world is shitty. Sel-improvement by buying shit we don't need advertised by marketeers is masturbation. (yeah, I like fight club)  Seriously, there has to be a point where you stopped thinking when you're buying expensive (brand) clothing because marketeers or the vogue tells you to.  If you buy ordinary, non-brand, shoes you don't have to pay much. If you buy the exact same shoes but then with, for instance, a nike-sign on it you have to pay much more.  - Hey, look at my new flashy nike-shoes. They cost almost nothing. I only had to take another 200 Euro loan. * Hey, look at my regular identical copies of your nike-shoes. Just 75 Euro. And look at the 15 cd's I could buy from the difference...  Don't get me wrong. I don't wear identical copies of nike shoes. I hate those shoes. And no, even for a 16 year old, 200 Euro is not a lot of money. For the stupid dipshits who do buy nike shoes it is. They're usually not well educated, have shitty jobs and hardly make any money.  Instead of the usual song text lyric thingy I finish this piece with a line from fight club: Marketing makes us work jobs we don't want to do buying shit we don't need...

      I'm a bit of a foottie addict. I like watching football when it is on tv. I like to play football too. I even like to read about football. The European Chamionships are therefore topping my things-to-view list. There is one thing I am not happy with during this tournament.  There are some good parts. Germany qualified. Turkey didn't. I am glad Germany qualified because they're almost as arrogant as us, dutchies. I don't really like arrogance but in this case it's positive because I'm against the Dutch team. And German arrogance is not seldom used against our dutch arrogance. I'm glad Turkey didn't qualify because every match won by the Turkish team would mean that some of our Turkish citizens think it would be nice at that time to get in their car, race through the streets without removing their hand from the horn. I know the matches aren't at night but it would've annoyed me anyway.  But, as I said, there is one thing I dislike about the tournament. The ducth team. Perhaps even more, the dutch supporters. The Dutch team consists out of arrogant people who are tired after a long season and unwilling to risk their lives for the dutch team (meaning they won't give 100% in a match). Their coach is an equally arrogant asshole who can't stand bad press and who's such a tactical genius to swich to a formation almost never used just before the tournament starts.  The worst really are the supporters. They are stupid, they're arrogant and they are most of all, stupid. No, the dutch team won't win no matter what you say. No, your support isn't needed by anyone. No, people who are more or less sophisticated don't like you. You're a bunch of assholes who should stay at home. Besides, you should never wear orange. I respond to orange like a bull responds to red. (no, a bull does not respond to red, just to movement but you know what I mean) Self fulfilling prophecy: Ohne Holland fahren wir zum WM.

      Once upon a time America was the land of hope and freedom. Once upon a time a lot of Europeans wanted to move there. One upon a time America had a good governament. I don't need to tell you things have changed. I'll do it anyway...  America, the land of hope and freedom? Not anymore. Hope? No way, many Americans are dirt poor. The governament doesn't provide chances. They live, they suffer and they die poor. Freedom? No way. Everybody can sue everybody for nothing, win the trial and demand millions without anybody saying they're pieces of shit. I don't know many stupid trials by heart, there are too many anyway so it would be a hell of a job  to learn them all. But I am not surprised that if I would say in public that I would want to fuck Hilary Duff she would sue my cock off. Not that I ever could anyway but just to make money. Hereby I openly declare that I wouldn't mind fucking Hilary Duff, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera etc.. I hate them all because of the music they make. The only positive thing about them is that they are good looking. (You can argue about the fact if that's a positive point. Good looking people are in no way better than ugly people, but just for the sake of this argument I'll say it's a positive point.) I don't have a girlfriend nor a boyfriend. Not in love either so I think I'm free to say that. I would love a one night stand with any of the previously mentioned women. After that they can burn in hell as far as I'm concerned. If they want to sue me for this? Fine , let them. My opinion won't change no matter how much they'd sue me for.  Once upon a time a lot of Europeans wanted to go to America. Currently most Europeans don't agree with the Iraq war, think Bush is an asshole and find most Americans stupid. The only Europeans who want to go to the USA are people who have to go there for business, holiday and ofcourse some politicians who want to discuss the Iraq war in Bush' bed. People like Blair, Balkenende and Berlusconi. They're Bush his bitches.  Once upon a time America had a decent governament. But people like Reagan, Bush sr. and nowadays Bush jr. took over. They're a bunch of cowboys with approximatly one braincell each. Reagan screwed up the economic state of the USA by increasing the state debts as if they didn't mind. Bush senior was a cowboy. So is his son. Bush junior started an illegal war for oil, Ignores Kyoto and is against gay marriages. There has been talked enough about the war. I'll just say I'm against it. Ignoring Kyoto means that Bush is partly responsible if the next generation can't survive on this planet because, for instance, the UV-radiation of the sun won't be blocked any more. And then his latest joke. Prohibiting gay marriages by law. Here in Holland there is a seperation between church and governament. The church has no influence on the laws. I think that's the same in America. Therefore it would be discrimination to prohibit gay people to have a wedding. A  S S  H O  L E

      Can you decipher the title?  No? - Don't read this piece. You are blessed...  Yes? - Do you just read it?      - Do YOU even write that way?   You just read it? - good  Do you write that way - Please consider if you're life has any meaning. Is the answer anything else than 'no' then you are wrong. period.  1337 5p34k, or in regular symbols 'leet speak' is writing words with numbers in it. Some letters can be swapped. According to the people who use it anyway.(e.g. l - 1) Or syllables can be swapped with numbers (wait - w8). This is about the biggest hint you can give somebody that you're galactically stupid. w8 is not a word. w8 is nothing. Perhaps the name of a highway somehwere but not a word. You must have lost all interest to think if you write that way. Serious, how hard is it to write 'ait' instead of '8'? Will your fingers fall apart if you just type the complete word?   Another sign of complete idiocy is using words like 'rite' instead of 'right'. Even people with a mental handicap write better than that. I will confess, I wrote like that once upon a time as well. I was a child. Ofcourse, I'm still not an adult yet but way more mature than back then. Only if you're in a hurry you have the right to write 'right' wrong, 'rite' for instance.   If you still use 1337 5p34k then you might start moo-ing too because you're a cow. Don't feel guilty, master writing.

      Yesterday there were elections for the European Union. People actually voted. I'm not allowed to vote yet but if I were allowed to I wouldn't have voted or I would've cast a blanco vote. The day of the elections I knew the name of 2 of the main candidats. Not more. I was not obsessed by the elections, but I watched enough tv to have been able to know them all if their promotion was decent.  Ofcourse, you should not vote for people but the groups who support them. I'm a left winger but what the left wing groups did not have anything to say. They said "this is wrong and that is wrong" but they didn't give solutions. The right wing groups did the same. But they were giving solutions. But I don't think Holland should leave the EU nor that there should be many rules to keep foreigners out. Don't get me wrong, the right wing politicians weren't very clear about their points of view but clearer than the left wing politicians.  There were other groups too. Some guy who didn't have anything to say except that everything was wrong in Brussels. He got more than 7% of the votes.  But there were even bigger losers. The Party for the Animals. Their points: European constitution? As long as there are animal rights in it. No more animals used for entertainment etc. etc..  If I will ever meet somebody of that group I will kick my foot through her (most of the members are female)ass out of her mouth. I mean please, you can be ignorant but these people add a new dimension to it. When was the last time an animal (except a pet animal) did anything good for you except providing foot and milk? That's right, they made you laugh. In the circus or on television. For the rest nobody gives a fuck about those animals. Thank God those wankers just got 3% of the votes (they needed 3.7% to have the right to send one person to the parliament). I want to fuck those pussies up, you know. Perhaps the last thing I'd say to a party member (before I'd treat them like dogs) would be: I want to fuck you like an animal...

      Mankind has one big problem. It thinks they are smart. They are wrong. Most people think the world is a great place, that all people can be your friends, if you are nice to people, people will like you and that evil does not exist. Well, ofcourse they've heard about evil but think it's far away. Their world is perfect. They live in total bliss. Everybody knows ignorance is bliss. In this case bliss is caused by ignorance indeed.  People commit suicide. Ignorant people are shocked by that and don't want to think about that. When they see Britney die in 'everytime' they are in tears. Believe me, people tell me they cried.  When I swear people say I have to watch my language. Fuck them, there is no fucking word which caused immediate death to the shitty person who heard it. People tell me I should be more positive. I get even more angry and negative towards the human being in general that way.  People listen to 'everytime' by Britney and think "O, that's a mellow song, and it is so sensitive, it's great". Time to wake up people. She is after your money. She didn't write it, she doesn't have a good voice and the lyrics are crap. She sells her music with her body. All bubblegum pop singers and their fans should be put on another planet. People think they're sophisticated when they listen to a sensitive sounding song. They're wrong.  Here in Holland 20% of all television viewers zap away when there are images of real suffering people on the television. People are to fucking blind to see what a fix they're in. Do you expect a fool to see what a fix he's in? (I guess not) The world is a vampire sent to drain...

      Welcome to my blog, in a couple of months the best blog to read if you want to read about all types of alternative music, read (my) funny articles and read about my opinion on all the injustice in the world. With these three types of pieces I will never have a problem to supply more shit you will want to read.  What do I aim for? Being better than the best on the web. In a couple of months I will be funnier than Maddox (www.maddox.xmission.com). I will have more discussions going on than the best forum site, www.textravaganza.com . And you will have the possibility to discuss more about music than on any music blog or magazine forum.  Do you want to respond? Sure, go ahead. If you don't like my articles? Reply, I don't care. DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF I KICK YOUR ASS AFTERWARDS...   Toecrusher

      Yesterday evening I went to see Fahrenheit 9-11. I'm not going to use this post to give a complete explanation why I'm against Bush. I have posted about that before and if necessary you may want to visit http://piratesblog.blogspot.com to see me explain a Bush fanatic why Bush is a monkeyboy and why he should be replaced.  Anyway, back to the movie. There are sites where you can find things that were wrong and untrue in Fahrenheit 9-11. I have scanned over some of those things and I'm quite certain they don't explain that 2 full hours of film only consists of lies. The makers would have done that if they could but even though not everything is correct there is too much truth in it to be tagged 'consisting of lies'.  Anyway, now really back to the movie. Moore has gone easy on Bush. He has only shown one Bushism (= a speaking error in a word or proverb made by America's glorious leader George W.. as Maddox said before me: the word Bushism is stupid. When any person except Bush makes a similar mistake we call him an idiot or moron. This guy is nothing different [no, this is not an exact quote]) in the entire movie.  Besides that the poverty in America was only used in a part about the recruitment of soldiers. While it actually could have been one of the major points in the movie. But I guess that if everything where Bush is fucking up would be highlighted the movie wouldn't have been 2 hours but 2 days.  What was it about then? First Moore was explaining how incestuous the relation between the Saoudi's and Bush/America is/was and how incestuous the relation between Bush (and some of his ministers) and the companies who are helping rebuilding Iraq is.  After that the Afghanistan war became highlighted. It showed how it was just used as an excuse to attack Iraq. That Afghanistan didn't really matter. There were people quoting Bush and Rumsfeld saying that Iraq was the only thing on their mind.  Anyway, next up, the Iraq war. Did Moore talk about the fact that international laws had been broken? No. Neither could he talk about the images from the Iraq prisons. The movie was released before that. Still, without those points, he managed to show everybody why George Bush should be stopped.  Anyway. When you saw Bush or heard a quote of Bush you were waiting for the inserted laughing of the audience like you hear it with sitcoms and such. Not waiting for a laughter like when Al Bundy says something cool. No, more like a laughter following a Kelly Bundy remark. The laughter didn't come though but perhaps I didn't notice it because the real audience could have drowned it out.  Yes. There were some bad arguments in the movie. Fuck that. Every Bush Dipshit will hold that and say 'hey lookie here, this is wrong, I guess everything is wrong then'. Fuck them, they're ignorant.  In the fields are bodies burning as the war machine keeps turning death and hatred to manking poisoning their brainwashed minds (O moore yeah?!?)

      Movies annoy me a lot at the moment. At least, hollywood movies. Hollywood movies are a threat to the human mind. People see those movies and think they are real. Let me give you some examples:  Spiderman (1): I am not trying to say that kids believe spiderman is real. (although in Turkey some kids thought they could survive jumping off a building and win over gravity just like Ash Catchem from the Japanese cartoon PoKeMoN.) But what does annoy me is the love scenes in the movie. Short summary: Peter Parker gets bitten by a radio active spider, without further explanation he gets spider ability's and he takes spiderman as his alter ego. Peter Parker has a crush on a girl called Mary Jane. She plays the role of stupid whore who happens to be the crush of the superhero and who happens to get caught by the evil guy. Spiderman saves the day. Ofcourse he almost lost. And ofcourse MJ almost died as well but everything ends well. What is wrong here? a) good always wins. Bullshit. b) Near the end of the movie MJ confesses her love to Parker. Does love always get answered? NO! I wouldn't be surprised if kids would get the impression that love always gets answered and that when the opposite happens in their lives they can't handle it. If you want real, pure, perfect love that's answered the same way you might want to kill yourself in the hope that you can experience it where you come afterwards. It is very rare on this planet. c) How the hell are parents supposed to explain their kids afterwards that mary jane is bad. That they shouldn't try it...?  Same counts for movies like pirates of the carribean, star wars 6 and top gun. I'm not saying you're not allowed to like these movies. (well, except top gun. If you like that movie, you might want to consider checking in into a mental institutions) I'm just saying that these movies, these kind of movies are far from real (yeah, guess you're all pretty surprised that 'pirates' and 'star wars' weren't real). In your movies, you always let me die...

      Looking at that title you might ask yourself "is good old toecrusher a pervert?" The answer is yes although not in this post. This is just discussing the idiocy of some politicians here in Holland.  What am I talking about? I am talking about some politicians who want sex with animals to become illegal because it's a way of torturing animals. Anybody with a decent bit of brains sees that this is hipocrite. Therefore just less than half of the politicians agreed.  "Why?" You wonder now. "Why is it so stupid?" (yes, smart guy with that sentance I implied that you probably don't have a decent amount of brains)For those of you who can't think of decent reasons for themselves (and who therefore are talented politicians)I just make a summarisation. But before I do that I have to state one thing. I Am Not An Animal Lover, I Have No Problems With Eating Meat, Nor With Eating Meat From Animals Who Spent Their Sad Lives In A Little Cage.  First reason why the argument sucks is because nobody tested if animals like it or not. Ok, I admit that it's not likely that they like it but it's a first flaw in the argumentation of the politicians.  Second reason: Tormenting of animals? Since when do you give a fuck? You don't care about 100 chickens on 1 square centimeter but if you take out one of those chickens and give it oral pleasure (do chickens have a clitoris?) you're doing something wrong. Ofcourse, you can say "but when it happens with human beings (Iraq) it's wrong, why is it not wrong now?" and prove your ignorance. Human beings are not animals. At least, we might be animals but we're the top of the foodchain. That gives us something extra...  Third reason: Christians might complain. But they forget something. In the book Genesis God gave Adam and Eve the right to rule over all animals (except eating them as a matter of fact, quite ironic isn't it. Read Genesis 1, 26). So as a matter of fact you're not allowed to eat them according to God, but sex...  Fourth reason: The most obvious. We're humans they're animals. If some get pleasure out of having sex then why should ethics of other be in their way.  Anecdote: In my school are some pretty stupid people. The day after I heard the ideas of these politcians I started preaching and ended my speech with claiming that "my cat likes it as well". Lame joke, I agree but it got out of hand. I kept hearing it for weeks after. At some point I got annoyed by it and stopped responding. Except for once. One guy actually asked if I really did it with my cat. I was too baffled by that enormous stupidity to answer 'yes'. Too bad because I would like to have seen his face after that answer. Anyway, this didn't have nothing to do with the previous. Just remember,  You and me baby ain't nothing but mammels so let's do it like they do on the discovery channel...

      Are you perfect already? No? How come? You're a terrible person if you're not perfect you know? If you're not perfect you might not be liked by everybody! Ofcourse you can't be emotionally perfect. Otherwise you wouldn't be watching us, tv-marketeers. But we can make your body perfect. The only thing you'd have to do for it is give us all your money, follow many diets and spend your day doing sit-ups, push-ups, all with our material. If you don't you won't have a perfect body and then you're a pathetic creature. As a matter of fact you should do plastic surgery as well. Everybody should transform him/herself into a Britney look-a-like or a Johnny Depp look-a-like. So we all will have a perfect body.  This subject has been slagged off millions of times before. Maddox wrote a decent piece about tv-marketeers if I remember right and on www.illwillpress.com you can find a terribly funny piece about considering your weight and stuff like that. I won't and can't really add something to the things stated on this subject already. "Then why do you write this?" Because I wanted to, because I'm fucking annoyed by those people at the moment. That's why. "Geez, Willem, this post sucked" Go to hell, don't read my site if you don't like it, tell your friends not to read my site, I don't care, just DO NOT EVER TELL WHAT I SHOULDN'T POST. You can Suggest me what I Should write but don't Tell me what Not to write. People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time.

      Or more important the website of the white house: www.whitehouse.org . Why? I believe I quoted something in Bush's profile which reminded me of 1984 before. But that's not all. They have a q/a section. If you don't get annoyed by stupidity but find it funny then you should be ready to laugh your ass off.  Anyway: question: "What must I do to have the "President" send a birthday card to a wonderful full-time wife..." answer: "(...). We will make every effort to send the greeting in time for your special occasion. (...)" my conclusion: The person who asked this question should be punched on the temple. I'll rephrase her question: 'A woman turns 90 year old. What I really want is that you people lie to her by sending her a greeting from 'the president'. I love her so much that a lie is the best present I could imagine for her.' And, since the site is pro Bush the answer was: 'o, yes ofcourse. We'll be glad to lie for you. That's what we do best anyway, acting stupid and twisting the truth.'  Ok, this might be just an accident. But then I read the fourth mail: question: "Does Barney ever eat dessert? " answer: "No (...)The President and First Lady have requested that we do not feed Barney because we want to keep Barney slim and trim like everyone else in the residence." my conclusion: First of all, who the fuck is Barney. Here in Holland we have a darts player whose nickname is Barney but he's fat. Can't be him. Anyway. No matter who or what Barney is, the question is completely useless. Therefore it got an answer. If you read this, and you think you're weighing a bit too much, and you were planning on voting for Bush, guess again. Everybody has to look slim and trim if it is up to the president. Quite ironic if you know that America is the country with the most fat people in the world...  A third mail: Question: "Why is the United States not doing anything in Sudan? To see so many people being killed and us not doing anything about it, really disturbes me." Answer: "Powell (...) made clear that the U.S. will press for a strong United Nations Security Council resolution. We are, and will continue to very closely monitor the situation on the ground. " My conclusion: The guy who asked the question is somebody who was brainwashed before the Iraq war. Go see Fahrenheit 9-11 if you don't know what I mean. The answer was more striking though. It's a similar situation but here the UN is important while in Iraq the US didn't give a fuck. Does it matter that in Iraq there was a dictator and here people are just killing eachother? No, people die, and that was the main argument of the US to attack Iraq. The WMD can't be called a real erason since they were being tracked down and after the war appeared to be non-existing. What the real difference is though is that Iraq has more oil than Sudan and that it was easier to get the American people against Saddam than against an internal war. If they'd send soldiers the American people might get mad because they have nothing to search for in Sudan. I mean, no dictator, no WMD, no oil. Why should they bother?  I think it's clear why this site is ridiculous. Especially when you watch the answer to the first question which is on today (which was also the first question handled by me in this post) and the answer to the question of Donna from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I know there are a lot of stupid Americans, so these question might actually be real, but why do I get the feeling this is all fake...  I want to break free from your lies You're so self satisfied
