						   It was 1993 she merits the status of Doctor cos quite frankly she was superb on so many levels in my book Maybe it was the age difference I was 23 she was 18...although she coulda been 17 I really can't remember  we met one day at the local coffee shop she brought her friend to be on the safe side but we met because I was making a Zine and had seen that she was a local poet and I loved her work  I thought she had a swell eye for creativity and I had wanted her to add some depth to my Zine..she had a keen design style as well, ( i was making my zine from a word processor so there was no change in the font unless things were hand written) she had developed some fonts of her own and by the 2nd issue I asked her to be my co-editor and let her design some of the layout using the font and finding more creative people up her way at college by the time she was attending college   i had fallen for her hard   although it seemed we never really spoke that much on the phone spent alot of time saying  "uh huh"  nervous energy i guess  one of the first times we went out we went bowling and i made subtle moves on her while bowling she didn't seem to mind although what sticks out in my mind is later that night at a diner  i asked her a question..i can't recall what I said but she responded with "Is that a loaded question?" I then asked..what ? Is that a phrase from where you live ? I had never heard of a loaded question so I had no clue what she meant. So she just said to skip it.  a year goes by and we sparingly go out a few times more...more friendly dates than anything by Valentines day of 1995 we are still not really talking on the phone..(although in person conversation flows at ease) I decide to make a video journal of my life and at that time confessed on tape to how much I was falling in love with her...and sent her a bear that I had won at a carnival..it was the only thing I had ever won and I wanted to give it to someone special so I picked Doctor S#1  That Summer we found ourselves working the same job...not the same department but enuff time to pretty much hang out at work during work events. We performed together during a karaokee contest and did it spur of the moment ( i even borrowed someones yellow raincoat to fit in) we won on all levels of Judging..it was a blast the fact that we seemed to gel at least creatively   i thought for sure I had found the woman of my dreams   we went golfing one time too and i showed the finer points of how to stand..really close to your partner when learning to swing upon coming back to her place..we sat outside and talked and talked and caressed each others arms and faces..until her dad came out and it all stopped  One night I had her come over to my parents house and I showed her some of my films..we sat close and i began to tickle her..eventually we kissed and kissed some more and some more..she said it's getting late..and we kissed..you should take me home..and we kissed..and i said i'll get you home...and we kissed..I'll speed if I have to..and then we both said  "yes".  The next day at work she gave me a note it said she really really liked me but because she was burned recently..starting another relationship right now wouldn't be good..but the evening was fabulous...obviously i reacted quite confused..showed the note to my fellow female co-workers and they said it seems like she really likes you but maybe you guys need to take it slower   Indeed it became real slow   she invited me up to her school one weekend and i was getting odd vibes like maybe things weren't going anywhere cos she was far more interested in her friends playing some game than with socializing with me..so i was a little broken hearted  a few more months go by and it's Christmas time..she tells me that her favorite artist is Dali so I decide to make a Dali inspired painting and give it to her turns out I had also developed a stomach virus from visitng a friend earlier needless to say I spent alot time throwing up on this date  humorously depicted in my self published auto bio funny animal comic I made a few years later.  the date ends with her sayting we can't be in a relationship..cos she's just not interested in having one..why she said yes that night is anyones guess..it was just made for the moment.  Doctor S#1 has moved far South from me but we have remained in contact over the years. Enough to say that thank god for email cos long distance calls about nothing would not be good.  Despite the distance and the small amount of communicating we share..I still consider her a great friend, talented colleague, beautiful woman I am glad to have spent a few years with.  Thank you for still being a part of my life. You will always have a special place in my heart.

						   wow what can i say we met one fine day last June she bought my art work and then we took a walk in the park and got to know each other better that night we went to a jazz club the music sucked she downed some cosmos and i seduced her on the drive back to my place it was a passionate night of finger sex for her..i am not one for one night stands besides who'da thunk this one night stand would escalate into a year long bad acid trip she claims to have had to walk on eggshells around me well i felt like i was friends with sybil did i say friends damn it it we basicly dated without having sex then she found herself a boy friend and the 3 of us hung out and let me tell you there were times when she was hanging all over me in front of him why ? i really don't know then there is all those times she would call me like every single day in a row i compulsively never erased my caller id's yeah i've been known to call the same person a few times..i tend to focus on instant gratification emotionally but i am workin on that i am seeing a shrink hell when i met her she was seeing a shrink too and on prozac and a smoker and a pot head and about 11 years older than me we had great times and lousy times we laughed and nearly killed each other she was a bitch and i was an asshole what a perfect couple well this bit of insanity has come to an end i finally wised up and thought i'd rather be lonely than have someone to do things with and be miserable patient R not exactly missed and i do truly feel happier

						    why an Orderly ?   i could sit here and say she reminded me of a   "professional patient"    in short order I met Orderly S  while doing research for the film I was writing..I wanted to add poetry of a different flavour and noticed that a few people I never heard of were going to be performing poetry with me at a reading in the Spring..I think this was sometime around February of 2004  So I read one of her poems that was online and loved what I was reading, it was both visual ( i could use it as a dream in my film) and just beautifull stated as if spoken by my main character.   Noticing an email for this woman I took it upon myself to contact her. We conversed a bit thru email then it seemed that she was going to be at the Poetry Fest meeting so I couldn't wait to meet her in person.  I was dealing with the constant problems I was having with patient R and was looking to reconnect with someone new as a friend.  Orderly S cut out of the meeting early and so did I and we conversed a bit with an exchange in numbers. I was actually quite happy to meet a like minded soul and thrilled about the prospect of someone new in my life.  Here started what would become a weeks worth of mixed signals on both ends.. I wwas seeking friendship and she was just seeking time to chat with someone new. I wanted actual time to socialize where as she was content to just email me while at work..Then some of her emails became open/honest and downright personal..the kinds of things I would discuss with a future mate..which is why i felt like she wanted more than a friendship and that's why she didn't want to classify it as a friendship..so I in turn replied in the same frank fashion leading us both down the wrong path  Which is kinda funny...the more I think about it  As i always tend to do I wrote a poem for her..yeah maybe there was a feeling of a  romantic nature behind the words..but it was just cos i was feel so euphoric from speaking to her..and i tend to write poetry about all my friends in my life male and female  So the week consisted of fascinating emails from her written in like this cool cockney slang groovy speak..which i was totally diggin...and a few phone calls...  although a we were maybe to get together to see one hell of a crappy film and she was apt to lend me her copy of the JC Superstar CD cos I was gonna see the play soon..One day at work on a whim she called me..i'm sure I was stressin with my work load..and it wasn't the time or place to get a personal call..I can only imagine how rude I must've sounded..so the next day it's all over...she doesn't want to be friends  and i get over it and go back to life in hell with patient R  a few months pass Orderly S and I perform together at the Poetry reading and decide to clear the air on what transpired before thru the email again  So even if Orderly S and I never really connect as friends (or for the sake of saving her an arguement that term doesn't have to be used) I am really glad that we spoke again anyways  Hope to see her sometime soon again
