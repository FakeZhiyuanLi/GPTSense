        thats my blog name (adi):The photograph looks good and its probably time to get on with things. i wrote this as a blog and not as a comment for I thought that now that&nbsp;we have all started figuring things out again we could come  back  again and start working things out afresh.&nbsp;    We were talking, and there was an opinion that since all of us would get busy with our own work schedules, it would be a good idea to reduce our scope of work so that the whole thing becomes more handelable.

      greetings all,  I think yesterday's discussion was to identify and understand our alignments (and their problems) and that we can't assume our positions so easily. Which is why I think that the exercise of donning a particular stakeholder's cap would help to see the issue from multi - perspectives. Though I completely agree that this cannot be the publishing material for the journal.  Our publishing material, I agree and emphasise again, must contain hard core data to substantiate whatever we would put across while representing the stakeholder groups. Which is why we need to complete this exercise of the mock representation of actors really soon (I suggest, not more than four days)so that we can get to putting down hard core material on paper asap.  The journal has got to ultimately and essentially become a database for us (and hopefully others) to understand the issue of SRA (and others) more comprehensively than we think we do.  and btw, potu, u can delete prev. blogs...

       urlLink Metrologue-ing  hello all. i just wanted to tell you what i thought about yesterdays discussion. as much as i completely agree that its a great way to enter, youknow to take on the roles and see their interests and their working space, it has the problem of being slightly academic. in the sense that the political undertones, the ones that make sure that sra projects connected to certain parties get pushed ahead or the politics involved in getting the co-op society to sign the papers is completely unrepresented. i think this is a wgood way to understand the stakes, but we need a more data based study to publish. actually i'm not completely sure, what say you?

      (forgive me for babbling towards the end, very tired and sleepy)  Metrologue Editorial 3rd attempt  Metrologue is made up of?  a] young urban researchers b] Spent the past few years in academic space c] attempting to create practice d] attempting to reimagine practice through academic space e] f]  Academic Space a] advantage of being slightly insular, no client b] ability to bring together many different interest groups on a seemingly neutral platform (how to say this without seeming naively un-knowing about the fact that universities or colleges are no more interest free and maybe never were) c] can look at systems and methods in isolation from (?) d] might lose touch with quick changing situations e] has some amount of connectivity to situations in different contexts (global) f] might not be able to see the problems of a certain system because it cannot see the powers and interests of the actors of the system g] h] I]  Practice a] works with interest parties.  b] actors with the power to control the situation usually dominate contested spaces c] control implies knowledge and/or money d]  e] f]  role of metrologue ???  Talking about the City 1] the city can be imagined as one complete organism within itself, a balance of many systems 2]the city as a set of relationships 3]the city as a group of people contesting for resources  4]the city then becomes what we imagine it to be and our interventions are about that imagination. metrologue is about the different imaginations that the different groups of people have of the city.  metrologue understands the act of writing as an act of intervention it realises that there are many many many different forces that shape the city, it may be the bureaucratic frameworks, that produce SRA, it may be the act of newswriting in the city, it may be the films that are based on the city, it may be the changing economies, or the imaginations of public space.  please feel free to add what it could be.
