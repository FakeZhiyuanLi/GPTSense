      The purveyors of justice at the FCC have been " urlLink doing their job ", here's the beef:  - Someone claming they are K1AI was most likely telling someone where to shove it on the pig farmer band. FCC raised it eyes, mailed him. He says I ain't go no radio junk, if problem continues, delist me.   - WB2JIC might be interfering, broadcasting, and anonying, who knows. Listen to 7.255 for more details.   - KC0OAB ran into issues with CW pratice transmission. Hmmm..  - KC2DDD does not appear for retest, gets a no go. Oh well, right?  - Joe Mosbergen fired up his 2m handie talkie without a license. Probably cheaper to take the test.

      Not sure how many of you are aware of the comments section, but Dave N2NL  urlLink posted a good perspective  on the reason for lack of JA contest activity under my post a while back.   Of course, I cannot speak on what things were like 20, 30, 40 years ago, however ham radio still thrills me. I see a lot of other young'ins hanging in it and playing around. Granted, in the future it might be what it is but nothing lasts forever without changing.   Of course, if ham radio dies, I can always migrate over to pirate radio with some pretty good technical knowledge..

      Ok, I'm sure everyone has been waiting on the all new QZ Point/Counterpoint Article. (Well, I'm sure you haven't but I felt like writing in anyway -- keeps people aware that I'm still alive.)  For today's posting, I would like to point out how the ultra-lefties are bringing down America faster than Bill Clinton could drop his pants. I'm talking about the ACLU, or American Communist Liberties Union, and their utter disregard of policies that helped found and shape this nation. Today, as I was doing my usual morning routine of eating Cheerios and drinking coffee, I stumbled upon this article (http://www.reclaimamerica.org/PAGES/NEWS/newspage.asp?story=1762) It outraged me...I almost spewed my Cheerios across the room! I couldn't believe what I was reading. It seems  as though the ultra-lefty cry babies are at it again. They want all towns across America to remove any symbol of Christ that may appear on their town seal...HOW OUTRAGEOUS! And what baffled me more was, the ACLU took on one of the largest cities in America...Los Angelas AND THEY CAVED IN! This is highly unusual since the ACLU usually picks on small towns that cannot defend themselves in court due to high costs.  What has come of this country? Why are we letting the idiots dictate what can and cannot be on our seals, in our schools, on our court houses, and on public property. THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED   ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, NOT    FROM RELIGOUS FREEDOM!!! What can't these moron cry babies understand about that? And they get away with it, WHY? Because the left bent media has everyone in America thinking that we are the problem for everything that has happened bad in the world, and we should feel GUILT that we have caused all of these problems. I don't feel a damn thing! I feel that America IS the best place to live in the world, and I can attest to that since I HAVE BEEN in THIRD WORLD countries where they would give their lives to have half of what our poorest citizens have.   You want proof that the United States was founded with religion in mind, take this quote from Benjamin Franklin after the Continental Congress had dead locked on a constitutional proposal, "I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth: GOD governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice (ed. from the Bible Matthew 10) is it probable that an empire can rise without HIS aid? We have been assured, sir, in the Sacred Writings, that "except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it." I firmly believe this...I therefor beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heave, and its blessing on our deliberations, be held in this assembly every morning." Want more, Thomas Jefferson who wrote the Declaration of Indepence said, "God who gave us life gave us liberty. And can the liverties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God?...Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever."  Want more proof of the cry-baby lefties trying to screw with America. Take the Catholic church issure. Sure, what some of the priests did was wrong, and they should be sent to the elctric chair for their actions. BUT!! BUT!! what did we hear from the Clinton New Network? They TORE APART THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, in essence saying that ALL THE CATHOLICS WERE out to rape young boys. I guess CNN "accidentally" forget to tell us that in America, 13.7 children out of every 1000 are abused in America. (http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/publications/cm02/chapterthree.htm) But, when a Muslim, hostage taken aircraft slams into a building, CNN is more concerned about letting you know that all Muslims are not like that, those were just a few of the bad ones, and you shouldn't judge a whole relgion on a few. Want to talk about double standards, it doesn't get any better than this.

      Over the last few days, many have asked me why I have decided to leave the WWYC. There seemed to be a misconception on the WWYC reflector about my decision. Its not that I wanted one person over another to win the vote to become our spokesperson for the CQWW committee; its a much deeper rooted cause than that.  Ive noticed over the last several months that some members have taken upon themselves to run other members into the ground, as with most recently, the degradation of LU1FAM by KL9A.   Now, on to my leaving explanation  When Chris did this to Luc, no one bothered to jump in and let him know that he was wrong to degrade a fellow member. At that moment, it didnt dawn on me, but as timed passed that night, I began to feel more and more rage build up as I thought about it more. Many of you have stated that we are a group of comrades, but I never recall seeing or hearing of a group of comrades allowing one of its members excoriate another member and not say anything about it. Sure, everyone is entitled to an opinion that gives the world flavor, and is what the United States is built on. But, I dont think putting down someone is an opinion, its simply putting down someone. And to do it without that person even being in your presence is one of the lowest down, assholistic things you can do. I will agree with Chris, yes, you are a moron, not something that you should be proud of, but if you are, thats fine; it will get you very far in life.  Ive also unsubscribed from the WWYC reflector, but before I left, I took note that many of the remaining WWYC members rallying around KL9A, saying that they agreed with him and his opinions. Again, thats fine; to believe in a persons visions, thats what gives up political parties that decide our worlds fate. But when you begin to rally around someone that blatantly trashes a, as WWYC calls, "comrade", then I choose not to be associated with that in any way.   I think that all of the members of WWYC should sit down and think about this, are you accepting an opinion, or are you letting someone think for you? Think about it.  Maybe I'm being confusing, but this is how I see the situation before WWYC. As Mark Twain once said, "It's not parts of the Bible I know that scare me, its the ones I dont know that do."  73  Adam AF4QZ

      SCDC has decided to pull its endorsement of the World Wide Young Contesters (WWYC). This decision has been reached after some painful interactions with both the membership and the leadership. The current state of WWYC dictates that they go their way and we continue on ours.  Our participation was fun while it lasted. We met a lot of people, received some recognition, and we hope, contributed. Luck to everyone still sticking it out.
