      Hiz...i know i haven't been updating my blog. I just don't know what to write about! Aniway i have this Malay poem which means a lot to me.It's reali sweet and i just have to put it up on my blog....                           Ada apa dengan cinta  Perempuan datang atas nama cinta bunda pergi karena cinta digenangi air racun jingga adalah wajahmu seperti bulan lelap tidur dihatimu yang derdinding kelam dan kedinginan ada apa dengannya  meninggalkan hati untuk dicaci lalu sekali ini aku lihat karya syurga dari mata seorang hawa  ada apa dengan cinta tapi aku akan kembali dalam satu purnama untuk mempertanyakan kembali cintanya bukan untuknya bukan untuk siapa tapi untukku karena aku ingin kamu itu saja...

      This is my first time writing here...kinda excited actuali!! I've heard abt blog but got no time to try it out cos too busy wif school work.Anywayz im here now...i've read  a few of my frenzs blog. Quite interesting..but one caught my attention( my crush's blog)U may think im a busybody..but reali if ur crazy over one guy, u will find ways to get to know him..HaHa..im so paise..shouldn't share wif all of u!! Well his blog is really mushy!!!! sheessh..but i got hooked. His blog started off with some love song lyrics and then wrote a whole chunk about love!!! he would have gotten a distiction if he handed that up as an essay. He must be quite romantic..wow!! i know quite  a lot about him cos i spent the whole day reading his blog. i think during his first few entries he was in love with some girl and then after that i think he got heartbroken...poor thing.. My day was not wasted..i learnt a lot about him such as his achivement which was quite surprising actuali...i didn't dare to comment on his entries(would u do that to ur crush?). Being mushy is sweet but too mushy is disgusting! i'm not saying that my crush is disgusting!!..well no..maybe yes.. But i just can't judge people fully by just reading their entries...perhaps there's more to them if we get to know them better. Thats all for now...got to go..chio!!

      I had the most boring day of my life today!! The thing that makes it boring is the fact that i had to sit in the school hall for a whole 2 hours watching a dumb talentime which features untalented singers....reali.They just can't sing! My most hated performance was by the minahz from sec 2, singing 'Hi Hi Bye Bye'...Yuck!!! i still can't get over the fact that they got champion for the group category.Are the judges blind!!!! They r reali reali disgusting...many would agree wif that.The other categories r reali boring as well.Last year's one was better cos of the sec 5 band and the great solo singers.  Aniwayz..my O-level ML listening compre is just this Sat and my oral is like next next week.I'm extremly nervous!!! Well thats all for now....
