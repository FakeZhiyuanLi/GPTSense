      I went out for a drink with Hae Won last night. We had fun. I have a tiny bit of a hangover, which is strange because I only had two drinks, and then we ate. We talked again about trying to get a house together if we both stay in LA and have jobs. By December. That's enough time to get settled. Her mother doesn't want her to move away right now. She has some family here. I really hate the isea of moving for a job. There has to be more in it for me. Location is so important. I would hate to be in a strange city with nothing but a JOB. What would I do, just work all day and then go home and sit in an empty apartment. That's so sad.  I'm going to the Panarama's party/fund raiser today. It was cute last year. There is going to be music this time. And mint julups. I hope Mark doesn't hate it.  I'm realy excited about the house idea. I need space and air.

      I worked on my web site all day yesterday. My neck hurts, I have to get a real work area soon. I think it is looking good. The baby next door screams and cries constantly. They never do anything about it. It is verging on abuse. It is abuse, or at least neglect. I can't stand it anymore. I don't know exactly where it is comming from or I would call someone. It is so horrible. People are so awful. I hate living here, but until I get a job I can't move. Hae Won mentioned wanting to move in together. Getting a house, but she was drunk. I don't think she likes LA.  I have to go out and get more books. I've been reading so much lately. It feels good. I never could concentrate very well when I was in school. I'm starting to feel like I have my life back.

      The Krohn Design people do want to see me. Next week. They sound nice. I hope this is a good thing. I just sent off the article for ReadyMade. It was fun to write if nothing else. I'll put it up on my website anyway. The concept of design DYI project is really cool. Quite anarchistic if you think about it. I sat through so many lectures on intellectual property and how to make sure you get paid, but I never really cared. It is supossed to be about people. If my stuff is out there, then it's good. I've been thinking about doing my own projects with instructions included. I heard about a website that was about a collective attempt to screw in a lightbulb, but I couldn't get the site to load. It's kind of like my Equisite Corpse idea.  I wanted to go to that technology art/architecture thing in Silver Lake tonight, but no one wants to go with me. It sounds like to much of a party to go to alone.

      I have to do so much boring stuff today. Sort out my insurance, pay bills, try to deal with my loan payment schedule. I also have to do research for the trip next week.  I have'nt heard back from Lisa Krohn. She seemed into it, then she asked for some images of my work, which is OK, but now I have to wait for her. It is sort of her move next. She has my resume which has my phone number. That's much more expedient then trying to catch each others e-mails. I'll call tomorrow if I don't hear anything.  I wanted to work on the web site, the real one, but I don't know if I will be able to. Jimin told me that she thought it was some kind of game or joke when she couldn't see anything. A website in invisible ink. Sort of funny. Sort of not. I think that I am sleeping better. I have been waking up early, which is good. I always used to be an early riser. I feel more normal that way. I hate getting up at noon all groggy.  I've still been feeling kind of antsy though. A vacation will do me so much good, I think.

      I heard back from Lisa Krohn. She wants me to come in and do some work. "Volunteer". Why do all the people that do interesting, valuable work have no money? Society is so fucked up. Crap gets rewarded, while innovation and content gets ignored. I'm going to do it because I respect her, but it has to be extremely temporary. Maybe it will turn into something else. I'll learn from her if nothing else.  I heard from JiMin this morning. She wants to go see some art this weekend. Her friends from England are coming in a couple of days. It should be fun meeting them. I'm going to miss her when she moves to New York. I have to do some research on the travel plans for next week. I so need to get out of town. It would be good if Amy can come. More girls=more fun.  I went to a sushi place last night that had one of those conveyor belts with the sushi on it. It was an interesting novelty, but the sushi was not that good.

      I turned down the handbag people yesterday. I still feel weird about it. I feel that it is too soon to make a decision, but also I just don't know what I want. They seemed really nice, but "homey". But when I meet with big design places I get turned off by the slickness. Sometimes I really feel that I have made a mistake in going to design school, but what else would I do? I definately don't want to work in some dumb office somewhere. What do people do in offices anyway? I always feel so strange when I am downtown and there are so many people all out on lunch at the same time, dressed the same. Who are they? I can't imagine what their lives must be like.  I've been thinking so much about "monoculturalism". It's here. It's done. Is there anything to be done now? I guess I am a creator of culture, but how to do anything that is not just the same old crap? I can do anything I want in the proverbial "garage", but who cares. People don't care about what they can't see.

      I think that ReadyMade is interestd in my cuff project. I started to write the article this morning. It would be really nice to be published. I also want to write an article about design in museums and how weird it is. I"m thinking about calling it "Did I just walk into IKEA by mistake?" I like it.  I have to call JiMin today. Hae Won doesn't want to call again. I need to know if her parents have gone, so she can go out. I'm really craving a fancy cocktail. The weather is perfect to go to the Standard right now too. I hope we can get together. I finally made an eye doctor appointment. My new glasses are so cute, I can't wait to wear them. I hope my eyes don't look too weird with the lenses in. They are just so thick.

      I'm going to call in sick at my pretend, free job. I feel like crap. I know they will be upset. Lisa is really pushing for the website to be done, which is understandable, but I am so worried that I am in over my head. I just can't figure out this one stupid problem. I know it is simple, but I think the easy solution may have passed us by a while ago. We should have taken care of it up front, but we just pushed on. It was so hard to get Lisa to make a desicion. I guess I really didn't think we were actually going to publish the site. Now I wonder if it is publishable. I honestly think it looks unprofessional and weak, but Lisa wanted it so plain. She is a famous designer and I'm not, but still. I'm confident in my skills.  I just want to sleep today. I used that nasty-but-in-a-good-way gargle the doctor gave me last time. It works, but it is so gross.  If I stay home I should really try to call Sallie May and work out the loan stuff.

      I think I am getting sick. This is the first time in so many years. Really bad timing, but when it is a good time to be sick? Lisa wants me to finish the web stuff, but staring at that screen all day makes me feel worse. I think that I am glad to be leaving at the end of the week. I wouldn't mind if I had some time off before I started at the new place. It looks like I will. I talked to them again today and gave them another reference. They are still working out the details. I "got" it, but I don't "have" it yet.  I think that I like that guy Opus. I had no intentions of trying to meet anyone, but he is interesting and smart. I don't know if it is romantic, but it doesn't matter so much. Kevin told me today that he got solicited by a sort of mail order bride type over friendster. From the Philippines. I guess I'm doing pretty well then. Only a few weirdos. I have decided that I don't like the Mini. It is just a hipster, mid-life crisis car. Kind of dumb.

      I went out to a movie with Franklin last night. It was one of the Cocteau films at LACMA. Very weird, but not in a Cocteau way. Franklin was puzzled by it too. It was enjoyable in a staging/farce kind of way. I think that everything I go see with Franklin at LACMA is a stagy farce. The crowd there reacts so oddly too. They always laugh at really inappropriate parts, but in a smarmy way. It's not the respectful movie audience you would expect at a museum film series. I wonder why? After we went out for a drink at this Spanish place. I had sangria, which was pretty good. I hadn't talked to Franklin in a while. It was good. I got the cuff project out. It cost me $20 to ship, but it is done now. I'm kind of glad. Now if they don't print it I will be really mad. I want to start on the recycled tire project with Hae Won. I think about it all the time. It is such a good idea.  An almost infinitely renewable raw material resource that has never been incorprated into anything that interesting. I've only seen those hippy sandles from the '70's and some playground stuff. I think it will be a good project to try and get published. I'm going to see "Lost in Translation" with Mark today.

      I have to redo the cuffs for ReadyMade again. They send me these nice notes, "Oh, we love them...BUT..."  I wouldn't mind so much if they weren't so flakey about giving me the deadline. I have to redo everything and send it in by Tuesday. I am going to have to pay for overnight shipping to get it there. They are making such a big deal about the photoshoot. Maybe I'm on the cover or something. I doubt it. I worked a little on Flash this morning. I fine tuned somethings and now my splash page won't play in the browser. There is so much that I don't know. I never seem to have the time to really sit down and learn how to fix my problems.

      My "fans" have been reminding me that I haven't written in a while. I must obey them. Jimin has called me from NY already. She has been there 12 hours and she is already homesick. The connection was crappy or I would have talked to her longer. She will have fun. I forget how sheltered her life has really been sometimes. I don't think of her as unsophisticated, but I don't think she has really seen much of the world or people. I can't imagine a British boarding school. So different from where I came from. That's why I like her so much, I guess. She sounded a little scared to be alone in NY. I know she will be OK. I will call her next week. Zul will be visiting.  This "Opus" guy sounds cool. I don't know if that if his real name, probably not. I didn't join Friendster to get dates, but I guess a lot of people do use it for that. It never really occured to me that people would search me that way. I get a new message everyday from a new horney moron. Opus is smart and interesting though. He is a writer who has just had his show cancelled. I doubt that he came here just to write for TV. I wonder what he really does. He mentioned performance on his profile. I like him. This job thing is making me nervous. They haven't gotten back to me. They acted all happy to have me start, then they asked for a bunch more stuff. I hope they are not haveing second thoughts. That would suck, especially since I told a bunch of people about it. I hope it comes through.

      So I got a job today! The people at the exhibit/awards show/event design place were really nice and so into my work. It's small and non "slick", but still professional. They are not going out of business anytime soon. I have to learn Form Z, so they are starting me at a lower wage, but once I get up to speed they will give me a raise. It's enough, and I get benefits. I really like the idea of working within this temporary, fantasy entertainment world. Very cool stuff. It really runs the gamut. They have done things that were "extreme" sports oriented, and then theme parties based on the Satyricon. All over the place. I like that.  I had dinner with Hae Won. I told her the news, and gave her a bunch of software. She just got a PC. She has really good ideas. We want to work on some furniture together. I'm going to pitch the ideas to ReadyMade since I have a relationship with them. The second article I write for them will be paid. They should like the idea.  Things are going really well now. I'm happy.

      I've been getting lots of weird headaches lately. I don't know what is wrong. I felt crappy all day today. I have my interview tomorrow. It feels strange to leave Krohn, but I think it is best. It's not just about the money, either. I think I do need more structure. I get kind of bored somedays. It's hard to be motivated if you don't feel any sense of urgency. Maybe a little bit of stress is good sometimes. I definately don't want to lose track of them though. They are really great people.  I drank some of Hae Won's vodka last night and it totaly messed me up. It was just a tiny glass, but I never drink straight alcohol.  I wonder what is up with that guy Zeth. What kind of name is "Zeth"? Is it made up? Kevin said he was a Sci-Arc student at one point. He's a bit Burning Man though. Not really my type.

      I have a job interview with a company that does stage sets on Wed. It sounds kind of interesting, but a little engineering heavy. The equipment is fascinating. Very modular and kinetic. I like that they are not a slick product design firm. I'm done with that. I never want to be in that world again. I went to see Natalie Jerimijencko speak at Sci-Arc tonight. I can't ever hear anything in that auditorium. They should really do something about it. That raw, stripped down architecture geek thing only goes so far. I don't know about her work. She is so interesting, and incredibly smart, but I can't really get a feel for her politics. Some of the stuff that she deals with is high tech to the point of creepy. She obviously is pro technology, but how much? I'm just used to a much more activist attitude. Especially when you are dealing with things like cloning and genetics. I need to look into her more.

      I'm getting really bored up here now. I have a feeling that they won't be home until late. I actually tried to get the TV to work. That's how bored I am. They have three remotes, and they told me the process, but I forgot.  I finished my book too. I have been on some weird Vonnegut jag lately. I can't wait to get more. It's all I want to read. I used to get like this with books before ArtCenter. I should catagorize my life B.A and A.A, for before and after ArtCenter. I really don't miss it at all. I thought I would. I was so traumatized by the idea of graduating, but when it finally happened I didn't care anymore. I think that the last few weeks have been the first fun I have had in years. I feel like I just got out of prison. I know that sounds kind of over dramatic, but I can't help it. I wonder what it is about that place? I heard someone on Friendster call it "the big black box of death". Do Cal Arts kids feel the same way? For some reason I don't think they do. I wonder why? I really thought it was just the ID side that was so depressed and negative, but it seems like everyone was like that there. Maybe ACCD has that "sick building" syndrome thing? Or it was built on an indian burial ground. Bad, evil spirits.  It really bothers me that I can't remember what the company was about that wants to interview me. I tried to look them up on Core, but it was useless. Jumping into anything that pays is exactly what I wanted to avoid. I just can't imagine myself going to a "real" job. What do "real" people talk about? It's weird. It sounds like snobbery, but I don't feel any sort of contempt, just amazement. Whenever I am around "norms" I feel like I'm in the zoo. Or they are. TV is the one thing that usually unifies people, but I don't have one. That is what scares me about TV. How much influence it has on people's lives. Smart people too, sometimes. Talking about something you saw on TV is the last resort conversation in a work situation and when I say that I don't have one people usually give up.

      So, I'm up in the fabulous house. The party was good. Everyone seemed to get along and have fun. It's so nice up here. I'm going to miss it. Their bed is really nice. The steam shower rocks. I got two call backs for interviews, but I'm not sure who they are, I've been sending out so many resumes. I think one is an exhibit design place, and the other is the "gift" design place. What is gift design? Probably ceramic ducks or something. I'm not that desperate yet. Exhibit design would be OK. I want to talk to Lisa before I decide on anything though. It's only an interview, but the financial situation is pretty grim.  I've been playing on Friendster so much. I love it. I have talked to people that I haven't seen in literally years. Like Guy. That's the best part. And the testimonials. They are fun, but no one ever gives me one. I do them for everyone. The messages were confusing me too. I guess when I get a new friend, I get all their old posts. I responded to Franklin thinking it was new. I thought his message was a little strange timing wise. He is probably scared to tell me my mistake now.

      This hot tub party is getting a little out of hand. I was going to invite two or three people, but now it's getting big. All the English kids are coming, it's Jon's birthday, I invited Angela, she will probably bring Chris. Jimin, Hae Won, and Mark were always in.  I've told them about the white couch though. It should be OK. They're considerate people.  Last night was fun. The English kids are really nice. They were so into Thai Elvis. They wanted pictures of him and everything. The guy acts like such a rock star. It was funny, but they were being so "out of town". Cute though. I like them. They are so excited about seeing Quintin Tarentino's house across the way.  Now I'm stranded at home waiting for my car. I had to go to this place in Glendale and then I got kind of stuck. I called Hae Won, but I knew she would be asleep. I took the bus home. It wasn't so bad. I will probably take the bus back up there to get the car too.  Jimin is a friendster too. She says lots of ArtCenter people are, which isn't really such a good thing. Still interesting. I'm connected to that guy Senor. The DJ, hipster guy. And lots of KXLU and Sea Level records people. Funny.

      Kevin got me into this Friendster thing. It is totally addicting. It's such a good idea. So interesting. So far I only have one person signed up as a friend, Pete, and I'm connected to 1800 people. So fascinating.  I'm going to see Jimin tonight with her friends from England. They want to go see Thai Elvis. I don't think he is that great, but Jimin loves him. I want to meet her friends though.  This weekend should be nice and relaxing. I'm looking forward to it.

      The days at work are starting to go slower. Maybe I'm getting bored. That's not a good sign. I need to talk to Lisa about maybe helping me get a job. Kevin said she wouldn't be offended. I was a little worried. I thought it would be weird to ask her to help me leave.  I have to get my car fixed this week. I don't know how to juggle that and the doctor appointment on Friday afternoon without taking too much time off work. I'm not getting paid, but I still feel responsible. I should just tell her about the doctor, but I feel weird. I know she would be fine with it.  I'm starting to feel kind of stifled and nervous again. Maybe I shouldn't have written the letter. The old intern called today and she started talking about her life and it was kind of freaking me out, because it was so simular to my situation. It's OK though. There is nothing to do about it that I haven't been doing.

      I talked to Cory for Hae Won and found out that his wife has gotten very sick and they have moved back to New York to be near their families. I feel so bad for him. I didn't know. It has been a while since I spoke to him. I wondered why he didn't respond about my show.  I saw my parents on Sunday. My Dad is looking so much better. Cancer is so strange. It is the treatment that makes you sick. I really don't know what I would do if I was sick. It has definately prolonged his life, but what about quality. I think that quality is everything. I don't know what I would do.  I'm still web designing. It is a bit boring, but it is good to work on these skills.  Mark gave his resignation and they were really pissed. I guess that proves that they really liked him.

      Ben from ArtCenter died of a drug overdose. I didn't know him well enough to KNOW, but it is still not a surprise. You could tell there was something wrong with him. It's sad. OD is such a lonely, horrible death.  I have to make the new cuffs quick today before I go to my parent's. I was feeling lazy yesterday and didn't do them. I want to mail them on Monday. The shirts I got are pretty cool.  I went out with Hae Won last night. We saw the show, which was a bit of a let down, then had dinner and some drinks. We went to the Good Luck. Women today all look the same. It is so weird. Why do they do it?  Jimin is back from NY. She found a place. SO expensive. She seems excited, and a little stressed. She has a lot to do before she goes. Her friends from England are all coming this week. I hope I get to meet them. I invited her up to the house this weekend.  I got my Dad a 2 month trial membership to Netflix. I hope he likes it. I saw John C Reilly last night in front of the Vista theater. There was a film festival event going on inside. I think he was getting an award.

      I went out to dinner and a drink with Mark last night. He is so excited about his new job. I'm really happy for him. He deserves to have a good job. This is a much better company with much better work. I know he is good at what he does.  I have to call so many people today, and get my Dad's birthday present, and remake some wrist cuffs for Readymade. I need to do laundry too. It is good though.  Tonight should be fun. After the show there is this new media thing at the Vista theater that I want to see. It is a part of the Silver Lake Film Festival. They were passing out programs last night. I hope everone is up for driving back and forth across town tonight.   How can anyone say that LA is boring? You just have to know were to look, just like any city. So much is free here. That is what I like. It's not pretentious.  I'm going out to see my Dad tomorrow. I hope  Kim and the new baby will be there.

      Lisa told me that she nursed her child during a lecture at Sci-Arc. She was on stage, giving the lecture. That is so cool. She said that a lot of people, mostly men, were upset by it.  Lisa wants me to house sit next weekend. That is so unbelievable. I have to have people over. Not a party, but just a few so we can go in the hot tub and pretend that I live there.  Mark got an offer at the company he talked to. So much more money, and much better projects. He is so much better off not being at SOM. I'm really happy for him. Jimin called last night, but I was in bed already because I felt so crappy all day. I have to call her back. I wonder if she will want to go to the show on Saturday. Sometimes she is weird about going out. I don't know what it is. When we do go it is fun, but it is sometimes a job to get her out. It's not so bad though. I have had to deal with much worse. She has been in NY. I wonder if she found an apartment? I have to send Readymade actualy copies of the cuffs so they can photograph them. I thought they were going to make it themselves, but I gues it makes sense that they wouldn't want to pay for material. I have to make new ones quickly. Like today. I have to find really good shirts.

      I felt really sick today. I had a headache that lasted from last night. I never even know how to use aspirin. I had to ask Lisa at work. I never keep any around. She of course gave me about 10 choices and had the perfect solution for each individual type of head ache.  I did web design all day today. It is so boring. My neck hurts. I don't know how people can do that for a living. I have to move around more than that.  I applied for another job today. It is freelance for a non-profit org doing educational materials. Graphics, of course. Sounds nice. I like the non-profit orgs. Mark said he got my graduation present in the mail yesterday. I wonder what it is. I really have no idea.  I have been in a good mood lately, but I keep forgetting what day it is.

      ReadyMade is publishing my wristband project. They sent me a contract to sign today. I think it will be in the December issue. This is so good.  Work is so cool. We had dinner, got a little drunk, then went skinny dipping in the hot tub. I love these people. It just makes me sad that I can't stay there very long. I have to have a paying job. It really sucks. I don't care about the money for myself, what would I spend it on anyway? I just have the "DEBT". I hate it. I did apply for a job today though. At the Japanese American Museum downtown. It is preparator and assistant art director. They wanted 1 year minimum gallery experience, but I am almost there. It is mostly graphics work. Everything is graphics work. I think I will start applying for graphics jobs. Even Lisa says that she wants to try to bring in money by doing some "hack" graphic jobs. Even her hack ideas are cool.  I talked to Hae Won today. She is buying a new computer. She still wants to go to the art thing on Saturday. I need to call Jimin. She might want to go too.  I worked on the website for Lisa all day today. I guess I am a web designer now. It feels weird. I wish I knew more. I could totally support myself if I knew Flash really well. There is os much work out there, just not for me.

      I met Lisa Krohn today. She is really nice. We had a long meeting in the morning and then worked on more research stuff. I'm going to be doing some work on their web site for them. I hope my skills are good enough. I'm a little shaky with Flash still. I'm getting kind of antsy about not getting paid though. I have to start looking again.  I got my glasses back yesterday and my eyes look totaly weird. I knew they would. The frames still look OK, but I will probably never wear them out. Maybe I'll try to see if they bother me. My house was stinky and gross when I got home yesterday. Why did I buy fruit right before I went away on a trip? I still have to buy my dad a birthday present. I was thinking a trial membership to NetFlix, if you can do that. He might like it because he is home so much now. They buy pay-per-view sometimes which is kind of dumb. God,  I miss the real bed in the hotel. I slept so well there. I can't wait to have a real bed and a real bedroom again.

      This job remindes me of what I used to do at LACE. When I started there I was so scared of the phone and having to wheel and deal with people. I'm glad I had that experience, because that is mostly what I am doing here. Kevin is out of the office right now. Lisa is supposed to come back this afternoon. I'm looking forward to meeting her. I did some flower arranging today. Sort of funny, but at least I did something creative.   Mark dyed my hair yesterday. It looks good. It is getting really long. I like it. It looks good with the chopsticks I bought in SF. I need to look into that part time research/writing job. It sounded OK, and not really something that very many design kids would be interested in. It would prolong my stay here if I had some part time money coming in. Not too many days though. I would like to be here as much as possible.  There is some music tonight I'm thinking about, but I don't know. It is this guy that I think I have seen before performing with a dancer. Interesting, but I have been spending too much money I think. It is only $5 though.  I need to work on my website again. I would like to get it up by the end of the month.

      So I'm back from SF. It was fun. Hae Won and I get along really well. We both decided that we don't like SF. The Starbuck's saturation is just so high. You can really tell a lot about a city by the number of Starbuck's. I swear they were every 100 feet. It was gross. We did fun things though. Our hotel was nice. We went to an interesting bar on Friday night, Golden Gate park, Chinatown. We went to this museum of automatons and other coin operated games and toys. It was fun. We did all the fortune teller things and the old fashioned porno peep shows. I wasn't dressed right though. When ever I go away I bring way too many pairs of underwear and never enough clothes. What's that about I wonder? I'm a little tired for some reason. I think I will watch a movie.

      So I'm at my "job" right now. So far everyone is really nice. I have done mostly clerical, business stuff. It would be boring if it wasn't such a good environment.  Getting quotes for work from subcontractors, researching companies. I think I will really learn a lot here. And I get to spend my days in a fancy Hollywood Hills house. It's sort of like a fantasy of what a creative job would be like. We hang out and drink coffee and talk, play music. It's really low stress. I think when Lisa comes back then we will get to do more design stuff.  I'm starting to freak out about money though. I don't really have much left, and I need to do little things that cost money. Get my car fixed, etc. The trip is probably a bad idea, but I have to do it. I haven't been anywhere in so long. I have been going out a lot too, but I have to. It's good to be a real person again. I just hate to sit home. I don't know how people like Kristi can actually perfer to watch TV. I hated to be home all the time even when Mark and I were together. You have to see life.

      I just got back from seeing the Krohn Design people. They are a dream come true. Totally creative and relaxed. A perfect atmosphere. It's almost like a commune. The two guys that work with her also live there. The work is good and the people are great. I'm so sad that it will have to be temporary for finacial reasons. I start tommorrow. I'm very excited. I made all the reservations for the trip today too. We are just going to fly. It's a little more expensive, but there is nowhere to stay on the way up that is not booked or way too expensive. I think we will have fun. I haven't been away in so long. Things are starting to look up.

      I saw Janet Klein and a few of her Parlor Boys perform yesterday at the Panarama thing. She is so cute. I really want to see her with the full band. Her tickets are always so expensive though. I guess it would be worth it.  There is some Icelandic electronic music tonight at Line Space Line. I may go, I'm not sure.  I have to start booking for our trip. We are going to stay at the Hotel Diva in SF. Very apropos I think! Then Big Sur, which is so beautiful, and then one more place we haven't decided on yet. We think it will cost about $250 or so a piece. Not so bad. I'm going to miss my Dad's 60th birthday on Saturday, though. I always forget when his birthday is. Always. I know it is early fall, that's it. They are having a party. I have to get him something nice.  I've been reading a lot of Vonnegut lately. I can't believe I have never read him before. I love it. I just started "Breakfast of Champions". It is so amazing. It is so dense politically and philosophically, but so much fun to read. They go very fast.  My web site is almost done. I should be ready to publish the test this week. I think it is looking good.

      Maureen is having a Halloween party. I don't really want to drive to Pasadena, but I do love to dress up for Halloween. It has been so many years since I have though. I never know anyone who has parties. I have to decide soon though, since it is tomorrow. Hae Won called yesterday, so maybe that is what she wanted. I have to call her back. I heard from Amy and it looks like she has another (maybe) candidate for the collective. I hate organizing things, but it seems like no one else ever will. It kind of makes me depressed. I get excited about an idea, but the thought of doing ALL the work is not fun. Then, I think I look flaky, because I can't get up the energy. It is a vicious cycle. No on wants to be "first". It has to be established first before anyone will join up. In some ways I don't blame them, but I would be totally into doing something with someone I didn't know. Or who maybe hadn't done it before. That is part of the fun. I just don't know the right people.  I think something is wrong with my car, again. At lunch today I couldn't get it to start, so I freaked out about being stranded and taking days off so early. The only solution I could think of was to arrange for a car rental, have them pick me up at work, get the car, then...have AAA tow my old car to the mechanic. Expensive, but the only way. I got a reservation and then went out to my car to try it one more time and it started. Just when the guy from the rental car place was pulling up too. Now I don't know if I did the right thing driving it home, because if it doesn't start in the morning I'm stuck. I have to figure out a way to get a better car soon. This is ridiculous.  Work is weird too. I have been hearing things about it having a really high turnover, and that only in a bad economy do they get "good" applicants. Real designers. I think it is going to turn out to be kind of a depressing place. I hope not, but I think it might. I couldn't have done anything else though. Things are just so shitty right now. This is why I'm trying so hard to get something else going on creatively. I have to do something. Just sitting at a desk at some crappy place is not what I've worked so hard for. It makes me angry and depressed at the same time. I feel helpless sometimes.

      Work is going pretty well. I'm learning Form Z (I think) quickly enough. I keep having a few minor, but annoying problems over and over again, but I know I will get the hang of it soon. The office environment is probably very typical. At least it seems so. The designers are by themselves, the shop guys are by themselves and there is one "office lady" that runs everything. She has sort of a very fragile, friendliness. She's ok, but I can tell if something ever went wrong she would freak out. She kind of did already when I didn't have a time card. I think she doesn't get along with the wife. Typical.  I found a nice park to read and eat lunch in. That has been by goal the last few days, to find a nice place to spend my break. I was getting frustrated, but then I found it. It will be ok, at least until it gets cold and starts to rain or something. Finding nice, clean, REALLY open, public space is one of my personal peeves. It truly hardly exists. It is so sad.

      So, I'm going to my new job today. Of coarse I was totally nervous about the time change thing. That would be a really dumb reason to be late on your first day. I had a little trouble sleeping, but not so bad. I hope this thing works out. Right now, I just want something to hold me over until I can get other aspects of my life in order. School made everything so disordered. I felt that I was living in a very artificial world that I didn't have much control over. It was weird.  I'm going to see Masahiko Sunami tonight at Line Space Line. He sounds really interesting, and the compositions I heard on his website were great. I wish LSL had the room for him to do an installation to perform with. I would really like to see that sort of show. There are a few people around who do that kind of thing.  I wonder if it will be crowded? He is accomplished, but popularity is hard to judge in a place like this. That one time I went to see Dan Clucas and had to stand in the foyer was awful. I should have left, but I did want to see him. Or hear him. I heard that Cory might be coming back to LA and setting up a real studio. It is strange about the wife. It's not something that I would ever ask, but you can't help but wonder. Did she get better, or not... Creepy.

      I went to go see "In the Cut" last night. I went because I love Jane Campion, but I think this one was a little muddled. I don't know how I feel about it. I think that Meg Ryan gave a really good performance. It was interesting to watch because the "Meg Ryan Movie" has been something to be avoided for me for a very long time. The character was so strange and complex. It was really the best part. The movie is basically a formulaic murder mystery. The TV cop drama. The Perry Mason formula. The least developed character is ALWAYS the killer. So fucking bloody again. Really gross. There was a part that flashed to B/W, and Mark told me that parts of Kill Bill had to be shot in B/W or it would have gotten a NC 17 rating. The big bloody fight scene in Kill Bill was the main scene, so I can see why Tarantino wouldn't want to cut it, but the scene that went B/W here was just them opening a washing machine door and a river of blood pouring out. Kind of unnecessary. Maybe that wasn't the reason for the B/W, but it does sound plausible. I'm actually sitting here asking myself "How much blood DOES the human body contain?" 'If you cut up my body parts, and stuck them in a washing machine, would a RIVER of blood pour out when you opened the door?" "How much was water, and how much was blood?" Those shouldn't be the questions you ask yourself after you see a movie.

      The thing with Sami is going to work out for real for Hae Won. I talked to her last night. She had a trial period, then a real position, just like me. I'm so happy for her. I was thinking last night how well things are going for almost everyone I know, and how good that feels. The last few weeks have been nothing but good news for me and most of my friends. I finally feel that I've moved into a new, happier place.  I went to this yoga class yesterday and I feel like shit now. It was some kind of yogi bullshit that I had never heard of. Yoga House just gives you level numbers, then the teacher teach whatever their specialty is. This was level 1, but the yogi guy that invented it had some weird ideas about alignment, so now my body feels totally wrecked. The teacher also made me do a head stand. It scared the crap out of me. I wasn't ready for it. I think that is really bad. I totally thought I was going to snap my neck.  Today I'm going to clean out all my school crap. I still haven't done it. I need to now, especially if I'm going to be moving relatively soon.

      I took the job. I got them to give me more money with the promise of a large raise in 90 days, if I learn quickly. I hated having to ask for money, but I figured out my loan payments, so I know exactly how much I have to have. I'm happy about things. I feel that I can finally start to have a grown up life now. I want to get the practical things squared away, then start working on the creative things. I'm going to start looking for a new place ASAP. I don't know what Hae Won's deal is in regards to finding a house. I think she is probably not ready, but I don't know how much longer I can stand it here. I'm not a student anymore. I can't live like one.  I really want to get Soft Collective to mean something. It looks like Amy would be interested. It is supposed to be loose. I think that emphasizing craft might be the way to get it to come together.

      I ended up going out to see Amy's show. I'm really glad that I did. Her work is evolving in such interesting ways. She seems much more confident and focused. She is doing  entirely three dimensional pieces now. They are a lot more, I don't know, "strong" almost masculine in some way. But still fun. We talked about how she wants to retain simplicity and the punchline element, but of coarse, not be taken as vapid. The joke is the point, but there is more there. I think she will have a strong body of work when she is done. I would really like to see her get big shows after she graduates. Not just because I am her friend either. The work is good. Jen was there too and we went to the Press for a drink and then went to Jen's to have some left over birthday cake. Jen's house is really cute. I knew it would be. So much great stuff. Kristi was out, but I guess she  and Bill had eaten already. That stage design place called me yesterday and made me an offer. I really thought that I had heard the last of them. The offer is so shitty I can't even believe it. It's almost a joke. I was making almost twice as much with no education. I don't know what to do. The low-low wage is supposed to be only until I learn FormZ, but then I need a much higher raise than I think they will be willing to give me. I've turned things down in the past thinking something better would come along, but of coarse nothing did. Now I'm screwed. It would be ok until my loan payments started, but then no way. Part of me just wants to take the training and then quite for something better, but I feel that I can't be that dishonest with them, even if they are screwing me over. I have to call them today. I don't know what I'm going to say.

      I have a teeny hangover. It was probably the wine at Franklin's. The movie was good last night. I thought it was quite funny. I don't think I have seen a comedy in a while.  I applied for a weird job yesterday, so I wonder if they will call me today. It is maintaining and producing archives for an import company. I don't know what they import, some kind of Chinese tchotkeys. I doesn't sound very hard, but I wonder about the environment in a place like that. Some weird warehouse downtown. I'm getting a little ahead of myself.  I don't know if I will go to Amy's thing tonight. I know I should, but the drive sucks. She is so negative, but I know she does appreciate it when people show up, or does she? I guess that is the real question.

      I went to go see "Kill Bill" last night. I liked it, but it was sooooo bloody and violent. I know that was the point, but I'm just not sure that the world needs another cartoonish satire on satiric, cartoonish movie violence. Where does it end? Tarantino pushed it to and past the boredom point, but why? It was visually stunning, though. I liked the artificiality. He does take formal risks, which no one does anymore. I also think that the "evil" child gang was really timely. I do think he was making a point about society's fear of children post Columbine. Overall, it was worth the gore, but barely. I'm going to go see a movie with Franklin tonight. He wants to see "Intolerable Cruelty". Fine with me. He wrote me a really great testimonial for Friendster. He was a little cranky about me "pressing" him, but I think he knows that I didn't mean it in a nasty way. He did it afterall. He is just such a great writer. I think he gets me a lot more that most other people. That is really why I wanted him to write one.

      I saw the Uncalledfor last night. I really do think they are good. Very tight. I had forgotten how much I hate the Blackwatch though. Too many women with stiff hair and tight pants.  I gave Jen her cuff for a birthday present. I hope she liked it. Amy never showed up. What a surprise. I really should try to come out for her show on Tuesday. I'm sure CGS has a website that I could check for info. She only has one piece, but I should show support. She came to mine after all. I'm just such a lazy bastard when it comes to going to Claremont. I hate the drive.  Speaking of support, Jimin called me this morning. It is so good to have friends that call when they know you are down. She is the best. She keeps telling me to move to NY and give it a go. Which is good advice for the ambitious, but I just don't know what I want to be ambitious about right now. Also, she really doesn't understand the money thing. I can't just pick up and rent a $2000 place in NY like she can. I want to get something safe and then figure out who I am.

      I did lots of boring clerical stuff yesterday. I filled out my loan consolidation paperwork, and worked on getting dental insurance. Boring, but necessary. I'm thinking about going to the Blackwatch to see the Uncalledfor tonight. I wasn't going to, but it is Jen's birthday, so I would like to see her. And Amy will be there she said. Maybe Mark will want to go with me. He finally signed up for Friendster. A bunch more ArtCenter people have too. Jacob Childs put me as a friend. It will be a good way to keep in touch with people. It is so fun how it grows. The quantity thing is interesting. I have never actually counted my friends.

      My computer is doing weird stuff. I think I might have a virus, but I've checked almost everything. I'm extra paranoid because I have to start consolidating my loans and I don't want to open up that sort of info on an infected computer.  I entered a competition yesterday. It is to design "H2O on the Table". It could be just about anything. It's Italian sponsored. The prize is 5000 euros and lots of publishing opps. It could be fun just to do. I need to get some new work happening. Competitions are a good way to keep your hand in, as they say.  I talked to Kevin yesterday. He wants to go to that place in Pasadena and get glasses like I did. I hope I gave him good enough directions.  Had dinner with Mark. He is getting a huge cubicle at work. They don't really do offices in architecture firms. I guess he has arrived.

      So, I applied for a dumb office job today. A little depressing, but you do what you have to. I downloaded the forms for loan consolidation too. I've been productive in all the boring ways I've been avoiding today. Yeah me. I completely misjudged Opus. I think he is really genuine and nice. Isn't it sad that that is so hard to see in people? Maybe LA is a horrible place filled with horrible people? I don't know. I've been trying really hard over the last year to surround myself only with people that are "good". I've wasted too much time with too many jerks in my life. It's not romance, it's about friends. I don't feel very romantic about Opus actually. It worries me. I think he is so great, but I'm just not all hot for him. I want to know him better, but I don't want to start something that I can't finish. That is the worst thing to do to someone. He's not exactly jumping all over me either, so it's ok for now. He told me about this job at Legoland building Legos all day. If it wasn't so far away I would be into it.

      I talked to lots of people yesterday. I talked to Jimin. She is loving NY, of coarse. I wish I had the money to visit. I talked to Amy. Her mother has cancer. I feel terrible for her.  Speaking from experience, it's not a good thing to watch. School seems to be going ok for her though. She said she wants to join the collective. I said sure, because we really haven't done anything yet. It would be cool if she did stuff with us. She is much more talented than she thinks.  I sent links to the website out. People seem to like it. I know some of the pictures are bad. I talked to Opus. I'm becoming less into it. I'm just so tired of weirdos. I don't know what to do about it. I like him, but...  He's difficult. I'm tired of "difficult".  I started reading the "Culture of Fear".

      So I put my website up yesterday. There was one minor bug, and the photos aren't so great, but it is up. I feel like I had to do it for some kind of closure or something. I'm so tired of those projects. I'm going to keep it up, but still work on things. It's pretty easy to update stuff.  I really need to start doing yoga again. I feel so tight and creaky. I'll look up classes today. I don't know if I want to try Silverlake Yoga, or continue at Yoga House. Driving to Pasadena is a drag, but I did like their facilities.

      I got a decent amount of work done on my website yesterday. Finally.  I talked to Hae Won and she is really happy about the job. It might not be a real job yet, but Sami is moving into a new office on November first, so he is definitely busy enough to take on some one else. It's kind of funny, but he really is Salma Hayek's brother. I can never think of celebrities as having families, especially not families that they would talk to or help. That's why he is so busy. He does all kinds of work for Hollywood types.

      I went to go see Delicatessan and City of Lost Children last night. They are both such good movies. I hadn't been to the New Beverly in a while. It still smells like urine.  I have to call Hae Won today. She called me and left a message the other night. It sounds like she got that job with Sami Hayek. That I set up for her. Why am I such a fucking nice person? I'm kind of annoyed about it. I feel bad, but that's the way it is. I told her I would do it and I would not have snatched it out from under her, but I also thought that I had a job at the time too. Well, maybe she can help me now. That's what friends are for. I really am happy for her though. She was getting awfully depressed just sitting at home. Now I'm getting depressed again.  I have to clean my apartment today. The carpet is a mess. I want a real place again so much. I want a real bed and a real table with chairs. I didn't mind this place when I was still a student, but now I want to be a grown up. I'm also spending a lot more time here. I never used to eat here more that once or twice a week. That's why I never minded sitting on the floor. It's not as cool and bohemian as it sounds. It's really kind of a drag.

      I didn't realize until today that this blog had spell check. I'm very happy. I think it is really hard to get your blog formatted into a website. I've read the instructions and it is never that clear. I've seen other blogs that want you to cut and past the code into your site, but this one wants you to FTP it in, which is more complicated that it sounds sometimes. I might not include this in my site anyway. It is supposed to be a "professional" site. I don't say too much that is very private, but it might be weird.  I'm going to resurrect the eavesdropping project I was doing. I keep hearing really amazing/disturbing things. Maybe I'll include that on my site.

      I bought some new music yesterday at Amoeba. The sound in there is so intense. It is like Vegas slot machines or a mah jong parlour or something. Everyone flipping the little plastic cases. It was making me uneasy, but it was sort of cool. I bought: "Fold your hands child, you walk like a peasant" and "From the desk of Mr. Lady". I like the Belle and Sebastian more. I didn't like them at first, but now I really do.  I went to the Rotondi lecture at the Hammer last night. God, the Hammer has the worst seating. My butt is bruised.  I can never concentrate on what is being said, I end up thinking about my ass. We didn't see the music. We were starving and Mark wanted to get home kind of early. I've been a slacker again. I have done hardly any work all week. I have to do some today.

      I'm going to this lecture at the Hammer tonight with Mark. Michael Rotondi is speaking. I was going to go see Carla Bouzelich and Nels Cline. I still might. There should be time. I don't think the lecture will be more than an hour.  I think I will get some new music today. I haven't bought any in a while. I never know what I want. It is like clothes shopping. I go to a store thinking I know, then everything looks awful.  I heard from Zul yesterday. He seems to be doing OK. No job. Surprize. I think his parents are some sort of Indonesian "elite". His Dad looked like a dictator or something at graduation. They definately do not know he is bi-sexual.  Lisa Krohn called me looking for the files for her icons. I can't believe that I deleted them, but I was so sick and strung out the last few days there that anything is possible. That really sucks. I hope they find them.

      So Arnold is Govenor now. It is so disgusting. How could anyone think that is a good idea?? The whole re-call thing was ridiculous in the first place. There is really something scary going on with the media, I think. Information just doesn't get out anymore. It makes no sense. This is supposed to be the "information age", but you have to be  some creepy, jobless, paranoiac (like me!) to find anything out. You have to have time to dig for it, and most people don't, or won't. It is so sad. The "liberal media" truely doesn't exist anymore, if it ever did.

      I'm going to work out this website problem once and for all today. I'm getting bored of me bitching about it. The new icons are cute, but a little slick. Fuck it. I'm a slick, slimey ArtCenter graduate.  That guy Adam wants to meet me. I don't think I'm going to respond. He doesn't sound that interesting. Its probably only a sex thing and he's not that apealing to me. It is too weird.  Opus is still nice and interesting. He doesn't seem even interested in meeting at all. That's fine. Friendster is more of a pen pal thing for me that an assignation thing. He's sort of funny, which is strange because he gets paid to be funny. Franklin once told me that he had a friend who was a comedy writer who was very unfunny in person. I thought that was funny, but I understood. I want to see the Lee Bontecue (sp?) show this week.

      I just can't shake this cold. I haven't done much of anything but I feel like I've run a mile or something. I felt the same way yesterday, too. I feel pretty good in the morning, but as soon as I get up, I'm a mess. I hate it. I had breakfast with Hae Won today. We went to Millie's, but it got so crowded we left before we were really ready to. We felt bad hogging a table. We wanted to work. Then we went to the Bourgouis Pig, which is always a bad idea. It wasn't crowded, but the coffee sucks, and I started to feel crappy again. We did talk about our ideas a little bit, though. I really think I've heard the last of the exhibition people. They were not honest with me I think. The worst part is that I'm so desperate for work that if they did call me back, I would probably have to take it. There is just nothing else out there. I don't feel so bad about it for some reason though. I'm still so happy to be out of school and able to be myself again. I'm strangely unconcerned. I'm still on some weird honeymoon.

      I started looking into magazine submission guidelines today.  I should start to get stuff out there. I think I have a good chance. Everyone loves everything, unless they are lying, but why would they? I should contact Jamie and Shawn before I send out the wall system though. I'm sure Jamie will be fine, but Shawn is kind of funny sometimes. I would hate for them to run across it in a magazine and get all pissed. I'll totally give credit where credit is due, but still.  I just can't seem to get the website together. Everytime I get so far, I start to hate everything I've done. Now, my file hirarchy is getting screwy because I've redone everything so many times, and I can't load what I have. I think I have to start from scratch again. I hate it all (again) anyway.  I've become obsessed with the idea of going to Cuba. It's slightly inconvenient, but there is really no danger. American's have these perceptions of communist countries jammed down their throats that are either, "It will be totally dangerous and oppressive." or "Everyone will be starving and it will be depressing."  Everything I've read about Cuba says much to the contrary. I really want it to be my next vacation. It looks so beautiful and interesting. Hae Won said she would be into it. She can't travel until she gets her work visa, which means a job in the first place. But I wouldn't be ready to take a vacation until next year anyway.

      ReadyMade asked me for a bio and a photo today. I didn't know if I wanted to write a serious bio or be kind of funny. I like the funny ones, but sometimes they are too smarmy. I think I was in between. I took this stupid picture of myself for Lisa's contributors page, which everyone seemed to like. I guess if I'm going to try to get published I have to get a real portrait done to go with the bio. Nothing fancy, but better then I have. I wouldn't want to pay. Maybe Mark can do it. Or Hae Won.  This was my last day at Lisa Krohn's. I think I am glad. I did learn stuff, but it was time to move on.  I'm still kind of sick, so I think I'm just going to lay around this weekend. I want to start working on the tire project with Hae Won. Maybe Sunday. I have lots of ideas about how to make it work.

      We had a break through at work today. Zeth is going to code the whole website himself. All I have to do is provide all the images. This does mean some work sliceing everything up, but I'm really relieved. I would have hated for them to try and load the site after I'm gone and have it not work. I really think that it is too heavy the way I designed it.  I still feel crappy. I think I feel worse today. I left early and Kevin was a little cranky about it. I wanted to tell him, "Look I would'nt be here at all if this was a real job, with paid sick days." I'm only there because I like them. He was OK. He has a lot more invested in Krohn Design than I do. I got a photo of the new baby today, which is awful. I've seen Riley and she looks so much cuter in person. Why do parents always send out those first born pictures? They are the worst! She looks like a retarded alien. Mark has to send me his new work info. I was going to forward him this thing on the recall, but I don't have his new address. I guess Arnold is doing pretty well. It is so disgusting. With him governor I'll have to rethink my resolve not to leave California. There is no way it could get better.

      I went out with Kristi and Daniel last night. I drove them in my new car. We went to Chinatown. My belief that everything you see down there is crap has been reaffirmed. It was kind of dumb. We went to the Jorge Pardo bar after, which was OK, but not great. It is weird down there now. I don't want to go back. I met the guy who runs Coagula though. He was fun.  I'm so freezing right now. My apartment is the worst in the winter. My skin gets so dry from sitting in front of the space heater all the time.  I don't know what I'm going to do today. Maybe see a movie? That is the old stand by, but I don't know if I'm really in the mood. I feel cranky. I didn't sleep well last night.

      So I now have a new car. I ended up buying a Saturn, slightly used. What is so weird about it is that it is fully loaded. Leather seats, electric everything, alarm, CD, everything. I never thought I would have a car with leather seats and an alarm. It's still kind of a dorky family car though, but in some ways I like that better than trying to buy something trendy. My payments are only $180 a month and I bought a three year warranty. It's really just like new.  No more car worries! I have to get a birthday present for Tehya today. I should have bought something last week. I do not want to go shopping the weekend after Thanksgiving, but it can't be helped. The party is at 1 today. There is a really interesting sounding show at a new gallery tonight in Chinatown. It will probably be such a scene, but I want to check it out.  I would go see stuff other times, but it is so hard to find the time because galleries have such weird hours. Or are appointment only. I never see anything except when I go to an opening, which is NOT the right time to try to see stuff. Maybe Hae Won will go with me. I finished a 3D rendering for the tire project. It looks good. It took forever to render. All the little ropes. I have to find a real one now, so I can do a prototype. It should be easy, just a little dirty. I will have to hose it off somehow. I hope it won't smell up my apartment. I think it is a good idea. People should like it. I will have to try to get it published somewhere. I wonder if Hae Won can find out from Sami some contact info for good magazines? I tried, and no on got back to me. I will have to get good photos done somewhere. I wonder how much  photo studio space is by the hour? I could take the shot, but I need clean studio space and lighting. I bet Craig's List has listings that are pretty cheap.

      I'm going to go buy a car tomorrow. I'm so stressed about it. I hate the idea of buying something so expensive right now, but I feel like I have no real choice. I could just wait until my car finally dies, but that is not a good thing. I believe in being pro-active about things, but sometimes it is hard. A Saturn is about the cheapest car you can get, but it is still not that cheap. Used isn't so cheap either. Not for something good. I really don't want to buy another crappy used. That doesn't make any sense. It is so weird that all the 2-door cars out there are much more expensive than 4-doors. Every maker is the same. I'm probably going to end up with a big sedan that I won't be able to park anywhere. Hatchbacks have become the most expensive type of car. I hate it.  I think what is upsetting me the most is the idea of buying something that I can't afford. It's that fucked up, very American type of capitalism that I just can't stand. I need reliable transportation though. I have to have it. So here I am. I am going to have to be so careful about budgeting my money after this. There are openings in Chinatown this weekend. I haven't been there in over a year. I think it has changed a lot. I don't recognize any of the gallery names anymore. I used to not like it so much, because the quality of the shows were so uneven and it was such a scene. I'm sure it will still be scenestery, but isn't everything? I'm sort of curious. I always liked the idea of the Chinatown parties better than the execution. They were out in the open. No invites. No charge. Something like that is so rare, especially in LA. We use our open space so poorly in LA. I think that there is actually quite a lot of it. Just not used for anything. I wonder who would like to go with me? I should get together with Hae Won, but I don't know if she is so into something like this. Franklin? He hates this kind of thing, but he always has interesting things to say about stuff. He should see more art. I think everyone should really.  I started some interesting research about the fashion project. I'm excited about it, but I think that Gulbin was a little disappointed in my idea. The other girls loved it, but I have definitely moved away from any sort of mechanical transformation.

      Work was ok today. I did some actually. And I looked for used cars on the internet. There is a Toyota Celica that looks ok. It has more miles on it than I would like, but maybe the dealership offers some sort of warranty. I hope so. I won't buy it without one.  I am meeting with the collective people this evening at Mi Cultura. They wanted to meet somewhere mid-town because Gulbin lives in Venice and she didn't want to drive back and forth more than once.  I feel a little guilty about picking the place, but no one said anything. They are all driving a little and I'm barely stumbling outside my door step. I told them I would drive, but it doesn't really matter I guess. Matt's not coming. I knew he wouldn't. I hate people who act like they are interested in something when you just know they really aren't.  Why do these sort of people always find me? I have hardly anyone in my life right now who I can depend on for anything. I hate it.

      God work is getting so boring. I am starting to think that they shouldn't have hired a new designer. It is so slow. We are practically fighting over things to do. I have designed a new system a day since I have been here, but nothing really happens with them. Every project that Jim has given me is on hold pending his approval or something. I still can't tell if he is just a moron or what? Should I bug him about things, or would that piss him off? I feel dumb sitting here geting paid. It's one of those situations where I have to work to look busy. It's dumb. Either you are or you're not. Two people got fired last Friday too. Creepy.

      I went to Kelly's birthday party at the Roost last night. It was fun. Totally dance party USA in there. I thought the DJ would be weird, but it wasn't.  Mark dyed my hair. I proofread his story for Cement TeePee. It's good. Funnier than the last one.  I have to email the indie people because Matt wants to come to a meeting. He might be interested, but I don't know. I just have a feeling. There is something picky and a bit over cautious about him. He will come to meet everyone though I'm sure.  I have decided not to do any sort of website for at least a year. I just don't have enough work that I am proud of yet. I think a year is a good length of time to sort things out. That will be my New Year's resolution.  I'm feeling a little depressed again. My period is going to start soon. It is weird, I never used to have any sort of pre-menstrual problems, but now I'm practically suicidal each month. I know it though, which helps a little.

      I woke up really early and I'm kind of exhausted. I have been really socially busy this week. It's fun, but I'm getting tired.  I went to the Core 77 party downtown on Wednesday. It was good. All the fun and interesting ArtCenter people were there. The guy speaking was boring though. A furniture/lighting designer. Is there really that much to say about a lamp? The technology is cool, but then what? Hae Won broke a window and knocked over said lamp. She was really drunk. So was Sun. Those girls are crazy. Very young. The space the party was in was really great. I heard that it is a sort of co-op gallery/live/work thing. It was in a gigantic old bank building on Spring. All the live/work spaces are month-to-month with the idea of people moving in to work on a project, showing the project, them moving on. They want it to work for people, not turn into an artist hipster thing like the Brewery. Interesting. Gulbin and Karen were there from indie. Their studio is just a few blocks away. Last night I saw some music and some films with Franklin. The music started out awful, with this pretensious folk singer idiot. Good looking guy, guitar, "song writer". Enough said. The other band was OK. The film thing was amazing though. It was at the RedCat. They are called Animal Charm. They take old corporate, industrial, self-help type videos and films and mix them up, adding new sound. Really hilarious. Franklin said they do a music performance thing too under a different name. Almost the same thing, but with singing. He just saw them.  Tonight I'm supposed to go to that girl Kelly's birthday party at the Roost. She probably knows interesting people.

      It's been a little while since I have written. I went to see Nels Cline last night. He was really great. So was the guy who played first. Rick Potts. I think I liked his performance even better then Nels's. I went into a new restaurant too. It is Crest on Sunset. It doesn't look like much but it seems pretty cool. Almost empty, but full enough not to be creepy and literally, like 500 beers. A lot I've never seen before. We didn't eat. I don't know what kind of food they have. We just had a beer.  tomorrow I'm going to a party downtown thrown by Core 77. It is in a building on Spring, a place called 'Groop Space'. I think it is near indie-collective. It should be your usual big blow out with free booze. RSVP. Give a business card. Someone is speaking. I have never heard of him, but his stuff looks familiar. Lighting and furniture. It looks nice.  Mark got new tires and forgot to give me the old ones. I have to do the tire furniture thing. I don't know if I should give it to ReadyMade though. They made me sign so much stuff. It makes me nervous.

      The collective people were nice. I'm going to do the project with them. The woman who runs it, Gulbin, seems interesting. I didn't think she was a woman. I have never heard the name Gulbin. It reminded me of "Galvan". I thought she was a Hispanic man. She is French, probably in her late 40's. Very smart. Her regular work looks good, what I saw of it, and she showed me a book of photos and sketches of the previous project which was really great. The main point is that all the projects have to be practical. Like camping equipment. Very useful and simple. But still conceptually interesting. That is the real challenge. It is a cop out to make some wacky thing and then try to call it "art". This is very specifically design. I like that. The last project was clothing transforming into furniture. I have seen projects like that, which were mostly very conceptual and non-useful. Some were interesting, but they all lost something when you looked at them within the context of the designed object. These were so good, because they were so simple and accessible. But still pushing the boundaries, you might say. Our new theme is "The Garden". Bringing something organic into the realm of the wearable and portable. The big question is WHY. That is the fun part. You have to solve the problem of why would someone wear this? Why would they want to have a garden attached to their body in some way? I think it can be done. I have some ideas revolving around the notion of "public space" and "green space". Something I think is very basic, but practically non-existent in today's urban landscape. I want to do something that promotes independence from any sort of  urban infrastructure. I'm excited.

      I'm going to the collective meeting today at 2. They have a studio space downtown. I'm really excited. I hope it works out creatively for me.  After I may go by Amoeba to see the Carla Bouzelich thing. I read a good review in the Weekly. I'm curious about the project. My Dad always liked Willie Nelson. I think that Red Headed Stranger is probably the only country music record that I have heard all the way through. I'm interested. And it's free, if I can make it after the meeting.  I really want to find these home recordings by Buddy Holly. I heard them on NPR and they sounded fantastic. Just him alone in his apartment with an 8-track and a guitar. I know practically nothing about Buddy Holly. I guess he died so young that most of what has been released were over dubs of these same recordings made into pop songs.  There is some art I want to see tonight, but I don't know. Everytime I go out to art things I seem to get disappointed lately. I wish I had gotten tickets to the Red Cat thing.

      Work seems to be going pretty well. I started designing some new systems. Jim really liked one of them. He says he wants to put it on the new mousepad. That is kind of funny. They do one of those advert mousepads to give to clients. I have some more ideas to work on today. It's fun. I'm drinking the worst coffee ever right now. It tastes burned. The little coffee shop in Old Town is not open in the morning. What the hell kind of town is this??  I have to get in touch with the indie collective people today to get directions to the meeting.

      Monrovia is such a weird little city, but then all "little cities" are sort of weird I think. The downtown looks authentic. No Starbuck's. No Gap, which is nice. The shops have some crazy, but charming names like "Women at Large" (large sized clothing) and "All My Laundry" (laundromat). The park has a funny "life sized" bronze statue of Mark Twain sitting on a bench reading. You can sit next to him. The size of the statue is almost lifesize, but it is hard to tell. I always imagined Mark Twain as being a large man. The statue is a little bit smaller than me. It makes me wonder if the city couldn't afford a big Mark Twain so had the statue scaled down, or if he was just a little guy.

      I'm going to go with Franklin to ATP today. I think that there was more stuff I would have wanted to see yesterday, but  today has some good stuff too. The Stooges don't go on until about 11PM. I'm not so sure I want to wait that long. I know Franklin doesn't like them so he might be OK with leaving. Unless he is writing about them. Jackie O Motherfucker sounds really interesting. And Mission of Burma. They are great.  I went to the party at the clubhouse last night. It was good. I had fun. All my plans for this weekend ended up changing. I have to call Hae Won and contact Maureen. I was supposed to go to Maureen's today for her "discussion" thing, but free music is so much better. Hae Won called on Friday about the fashion show, which we both missed.  I haven't gotten back to her yet. I was too busy.  I got some really great pants yesterday.

      I went out for drinks with Kristi, Daniel, Lisa,Bill, Mark & Chris last night. We went to the Roost. It was good. So many trucker hats though. I couldn't believe it. I thought that shit was over. They all looked so dumb. Kristi is interviewing for a job at LACE. I hope she gets it. She would learn a lot there because it is not a bureaucracy really. It is still sort of punk rock. I liked being there.  My new idea for a non-profit org is to maintain a data base of people that want to work collaboratively from all sorts of disciplines. Kind of like a dating service, but just to hook people up for projects. There would have to be some sort of gallery space and meeting room space too. The shows could revolve around what ever the people participating in the collaborations are working on. Then show the best of the best at the end of the month. I think a lot of people would be into that. You could put up a profile that listed your artistic accomplishments and interests and contact info. Maybe have "mixers" at the space to get people to meet. It would be fun, but also provide a service. I think I could get funding for something like that.  I got my first paycheck yesterday. It was only one week, but a little more than I expected. I have to start saving money now. I want to move so bad, but I do think that the smarter thing would be to try to get a car. Mine is going south fast. I could probably get something for just a few thousand that would be better than what I've got. I have to start looking into it.

      I don't think I will be able to make the Indie Collective show tommorrow. It says 6 pm, and I didn't think what 6 on a Friday really meant. There is just no way. I might have a doctors appointment too at 5:30, but I don't know yet. I was looking forward to it. I heard from Jimin today. NY is getting all pretty for fall. That would be nice, to see seasons. That is what everyone I know who comes from other parts of the country say they miss the most. I really don't like being cold though. I don't think I could ever live somewhere with snow.  I get really weird feedback from Jim. I don't know what to make of it. He doesn't really say much, but he doesn't seem satisfied. It's just a stupid mousepad, so there is not so much I can do. He said he liked things yesterday, but this morning he gave me some vague stuff about "1st and 2nd read" and "impact". So is he saying that there is not enough impact or is he just saying? I guess this is what Greg meant about his "strange management style".  There is a party at the clubhouse this Saturday. I don't know if I want to go. I do to see people, but the drive and just the idea of the clubhouse is not so much my thing. It's frustrating. I don't know why I can't seem to enjoy people that much anymore. It would probably be ok once I got there. I haven't seen Kim in ages and she has been friendly through Friendster. I like her. I don't dislike anyone. That is why I feel so weird sometimes. If I could just say, "This person is a big jerk!" I would feel better about it. But I can't.

      I'm really excited about the collaboration thing. I'm a little nervous though. Everytime I get excited about anything I always seem to get disapointed. I do think it is interesting that all sorts of creative people are interested in collaborations. That is the big word right now. Not just in design either. Everytime I look at a new Friendster profile the person says "looking for people to collaborate with!" I think that in general, everyone, whether you are an artist or a writer or a designer is just so tired of the same old stuff. What is "new" anymore? More importantly, I also think that people are tired of thinking that there is no "new" anymore. It's sort of depressing to think that, even if you are trying to create according to a set of theoretical prinicples.  It's just not fun to beleive that nothing matters. Professionalism breeds mediocrity. I think I have read that somewhere. It may be a paraphrase of Dave Hickey. I know that spectacle is supossed to breed mediocrity too. The world has become a series of professional, mediocre spectacles. That was really the root of all my angst during my last year in school. I couldn't be a part of that world, but it was so hard to try to find what I could be a part of. I was so terrified of leaving school and taking a job and becoming that job. School had always been my "something else". If I lost that, I thought I would just die or something. I couldn't imagine an existance without "something else". Now I can kind of see what my somthing will be. It's still fuzzy, but OK. Sometimes I get nervous, but I have to keep reminding myself that I just graduated 3 months ago and I'm already having a piece published, I got a job, and I have the chance to meet some really interesting people who might be able to help me out creatively. I can't get impaitent and forget that. I am realizing that impaitence is probably my biggest fault.

      I got my diploma today. It was oddly anti-climactic. Everything about leaving school was  oddly anti-climactic. The diploma is really small and square. All arty and shit. I thought it would have a big gold seal or something on it. Look more official. Oh well. It doesn't matter, I just stuck it up in my closet anyway. That is what everyone does I think. I'm reading "Mother Night" and Vonnegut uses a metaphor of a mechanical gear to try to explain the "classical fascist mind". He says that they deliberately file down teeth on the gears as a way of living without obvious truths. They continue to think, but without having to know about things that most other people know and understand. I thought that was so brilliant. I think George Bush is that way.

      The indie collective people got back to me and want me to come to a meeting they are having on the 15th. I'm really excited to meet them. The project that is ongoing is called trans-couture and it is about clothing that transforms into furniture. I'm sure I have seen some of it. I think in the SFMOMA collection. I'm kind of surprised they are so friendly. It's good though. These are the kind of people I want to meet. People that are really doing something, not just half-assed trying.(like me) Their projects involve architects collaborating with fashion designers primarily, but it looks like other people contribute. The show should be good. I hope Hae Won wants to go. It is so up her alley, but she has been so depressed lately.  I saw Mystic River last night. It was really good.

      I went out to really good sushi last night. Of coarse I have already forgotten the name of the place, but it seems like it would be easy to find again. LA is supposed to have the best sushi outside of Japan, but I always end up going to the same dumb places. Now I know a good one. Hae Won is going to quit Sami's. He is not paying her, which I didn't know, and he calls her day and night and piles on the work. It is not right. I feel a little responsible, since I did introduce them, but I didn't know what he was really like. He's a rich kid who doesn't know how to treat people.  She is really embarrassed. She wants to keep it a secret. That "saving face" thing. She actually has been lying to her other friends about how great it is. They are very impressed by the movie stars. She knows better, but it is still frustrating and difficult for her. She lets people walk on her, which she knows is wrong, then gets really angry and wants to walk out. She is smart and talented enough to know that the stereotype of the submissive Asian female is bullshit, but it is still hard for her to fight it. I told her to quit, but I think she should finish off any work so she doesn't leave a big mess that he can complain about later. You just never know who knows who. Design is such a small world. I believe that it is important to try to take the high road whenever possible.  I heard about this collective called IndieCollective that does architecture, fashion and digital media. They even have a couture line. They are having a big show in two weeks at the Santa Monica Museum. I RSVPed for the show and then e-mailed them for some more info on what and how they do stuff. I hope they are friendly and get back to me. They sound really cool.

      It's been a while since I have written. What have I been doing? Just random stuff, I guess.  Work has gotten so boring. I'm not being challenged at all. I have to get out of there. That is my New Year's resolution, though I hate to have such a predictable one. "Get a better job". That's almost as bad as "Lose weight".  Christmas was good. I enjoy my family more now that I am older, I think. Maybe everyone does. Well, not everyone, but I guess, the lucky ones. It's really bad to still have parent problems as an adult. You can never really become an adult with problems like that.  I went to Cleaver and Chris's party last weekend. It was fun. I talked to Amy Nicoletta for a long time. She never seems to come out, but I always enjoy her when she does. Jen was sick, but she gave me a baggy full of really cool, vintage cufflinks. She is the best. I hardly ever see her, but she remembers things better than people that I see on a more regular basis. I need to know more sweet and thoughtful people. The ones I do know seem to all be moving away.  I got "Dude, Where's my Country?" for X-Mas. I started it this morning. It's really great.

      My Christmas shopping is now done, but I bought my Mom the wrong thing and I have to go back to exchange it. That sucks. I didn't spend too much, which is good. I don't have too much right now. I went to Point Dume with Tony this weekend. I haven't been to the beach in years. It was nice. We watched people surf. Tony surfs. Often. I don't think I have ever watched people surf who were really good before. The guys we were watching looked so comfortable up there. It was interesting to watch. I have a sunburn. Also the first time in years. I like Tony when I am with him, but I don't miss him when I am not. I don't know if that will cause a problem or not yet.

      I went to the ArtCenter show with Mark and Hae Won last night. I was so depressed by it. Really. So was Hae Won. I just don't belong there anymore. I don't care about the same things. Sometimes I wonder if I ever did. I'm still sort of cranky.  I just went on Amazon and bought a book for Tehya and when they gave me a list of possible things I would be interested in, a bunch of other children's books popped up along with "Hatred of Capitalism" by Sylvere Lontringer!!!  I thought that was funny. I needed a laugh. I don't remember what the last thing I bought on Amazon was.  I'm going to have lunch with Tony today. I'm interested in seeing his house. Then, I don't know what we will do. There is nothing specific that I can think of that would be fun right now.

      It was Mark's birthday yesterday. I took him to Hillmont for dinner. It was good. I liked the ambiance. After, we went to Kristi and Daniel's for a drink. Kristi is so much happier now that she is out of school. Who isn't. It's just uniquely problematic to be an older student I think. You are disconnected from the other students because of age, and you become disconnected from your real life because of work load and for me, just seeing 20 year olds all the time. I literally was losing the ability to have an adult conversation. A few years does make a difference.  I realized that ReadyMade ran the revised article with the old cuffs, so it makes no sense if someone really does try to make them. I wonder if anyone ever really does make stuff.  I finished the renderings for Mark and dropped them off at his house. I wish I had FormZ at home, so I could have done a better job for him. It was hard to communicate. I hope he likes them. I like doing work for people. I got another message from someone on Friendster. Now that I changed my profile to be "Just Here to Help", I get much more interesting messages from people.  No more "Is your hair color real?" and then never replying after I tell them the truth. How dumb.

      Friendster sucks. I just approved Mark's testimonial like, 10 times, and it wouldn't take.  Work is going pretty well. I have been given a lot more lately. I hate being bored. The ReadyMade came out yesterday. They put my thing on the cover! I was totally shocked. I feel like such an ingrate, but I don't like the photos. They shot it from behind, so the button is not showing. Just the big knot of thread. I'm not such a good seamstress.  But they put it on the cover. Weird. Maybe big knots of thread are in this season. I'm happy though. It feels surreal.  Tony wants to get together again soon. I would see him again. He was fun.

      I saw Tony Friday night. It was good. We met at Union Station and then went to the Hotel Figueroa to have a drink. He's interesting. He was a Philosophy major at UCLA and he knew Guy. He took a few of his classes. Franklin sounds familiar to him, but he never had him as a teacher. It's funny to meet someone who knows someone I know, but in a totally different way. He thought Guy was a pain in the ass, but he said he learned from him. I guess I can see that.  It's Mark's birthday on Wednesday. I'm going to take him to dinner. I have to get him something, but I really don't know what. We have such a history of giving each other bad gifts. I wrote him a new testimonial on Friendster. I want to see his for me, but he hasn't posted it yet. I have to remember to bring my camera next time I see him, so he can get rid of his question mark.  Hae Won got the job at the Apple place. It's freelance for now, but for real.  I guess the Readymade issue comes out mid-month. I checked their website and the last issue came out on the 15th. I can't wait to see it. I wonder what they did with the cuffs. When they sent it back they had cut through the button hole. Kind of weird. I know that sometimes photographers alter things, but why cut through the button hole? It wouldn't work other wise.

      I'm getting busier at work. Today I did 3 renderings and one shematic thing. I worked on a set for a Vietnamese talk show. Kind of funny. Asian stuff is always so cheesy. They had a "talk" with me yesterday and said that I would be getting more responsibility. That would be good, but Jim is so weird. I'm definitely looking again after the first of the year. I even uploaded a correction to the website today. I was so worried that I would mess it up, but it worked fine.  I'm going to meet Tony Friday night at Union Station. Kind of weird for a date, but fun weird. I don't know how I feel about it. He seems interesting, but kind of flaky and too deliberate somehow. Self conscious. I'm curious though. Hae Won got an interview with this place that makes peripherals for Apple. They are in Pacific palisades. She says it looks boring, but stable. Not crazy like Sami/scamy. I hope she gets it.

      I broke an Epson printer today at work. I did fix it, but still. I was changing the ink cartridge and the crappy little plastic piece broke off in my hand. Work is so weird. I was seriously stressed that Jim and Rose would find out and fire me. They do that sort of thing, I hear. All I had to do was print out some color comps of the mousepad and it took all day because of the printer drama. Getting an ink cartridge out of Rose was incredible. Such a big deal. I think that Jim and Rose are really cheap in the way that actually costs them money in the long run.  I'm still so nervous driving my car. It's so big and suburban housewife. It's weird. It was really the best I could do though. I will get used to it. I talked to Hae Won yesterday. She was out of town for the weekend. Her family lives in Irvine. She still doesn't know what is going on with Sami. She's not upset anymore about it though, which is good.  ArtCenter show is next week. I can't believe it has only been one semester since I left school. It feels like forever. In a good way. I still feel so good about being done with school. I do not want to go to grad school anymore. You get to study much cooler stuff, but I need to be out in the world.

      I haven't been in the mood to write lately. I wonder why. Too much general boredom. New Year's was good. Christmas was good.  Tony is crazy. I don't think I will be seeing him anymore. He e-mailed me on Christmas and on New Years. We are "friends", I guess. I have no animosity towards him, but I just don't want to deal with him in a romantic way. He has a lot of things to work out in his life. Sometimes I think that the early 30's are just as bad as being a teenager. Everyone is trying to "work things out". It's the last chance really. If you can't do it now, you never will. Very stressful. When you're a kid, it may feel like everything is the end of the world, but you really have so much time. At 33, there really isn't so much time left. I think that Mark is almost the only person I know who has it figured out. Maybe Franklin. He's doing well. Everyone else, I don't know about. No one is doing "bad", except for maybe Tony, but just not "great". Just OK. Like me. I shouldn't be so hard on Tony, but he is very different from me. Different in ways that I really don't want to deal with.

      I had a long conversation last night with Kristi and Daniel about "institutions", "the canon" and "hegemony". I almost never go to big museums anymore. I'm just not interested anymore. Have my interests evolved or have museums gotten more boring? I don't feel that I HAVE to take an interest in the big shows, but does that just put me at risk of becoming someone who complains about what they don't really take the effort to experience? Like the person who refuses to vote and believes that they are making some kind of statement on futility or something. When I hear about someone bitching about the blockbuster shows because they feel that  they are either too distant from the public or too pop culture, it just doesn't make much sense. You can't have it both ways. Or maybe you can. The people that I have been reading lately that are making the most sense are the ones who just want to tear it down and create something new. I believe that the "big" museum does serve an educational and a cultural purpose. The problem is that they have become the only way in which people are allowed to view art. I understand the frustration of that for an artist. How can they do anything if the only way for them to get their work shown is to do something like what others are doing so they too can be included in the "canon".  What is the point of making if no one ever gets the chance to see it?

      I put up my first bench this morning. There were tons of people around, which I wasn't expecting. It made me kind of nervous, and of coarse, no one would sit on it with me there. I don't blame them. I just hope it is still there when I go back later. I really need a photo of someone using it. I hope people do use it. They might not. It looked kind of shabby down there next to all the primary colored tile. I think that might be the next step. To design them to really fit in with the space. If it looks too alien it will just put people off. The whole point is to make people more comfortable. Next, I'm thinking about in front of The Gap at Hollywood/Highland or maybe in front of the Home Depot for the day labourers.   The HD site bothers me a little, because if the city comes by and sees them they might blame the guys. I wonder if there could be a ticket involved. Littering? I don't know. I've thought about putting a stamp or label on the pieces to identify them. Ant Farm did that. It could be cool. Maybe it could just say "Love Shannon", like it is a gift. That is my point really.

      So, it looks like none of those jobs came through. They were so weird and random anyway. Sometimes I wonder if I could just take the risk and quite my job, if something "weird and random" wouldn't come through. It's too scary being alone to do that. As it is, I would have to ask Mark for some support and he wouldn't be into that. If I got fired or laid off I know he would help me, but quitting is different.  I'm going to get some wood for the benches today. I got the address of the secret Home Depot in Glendale. I could never find it before, because the location is so weird. I have heard that it is almost empty. I really hate the HD by my house. It's crowded all the time. I'm also going to take some photos of messed up public space. I don't know what to call this. It is sort of "visual research" that sort of relates to the informal use project, but not really. I want to find more examples of places where people have altered things to fix problems created by the city. Like the parking space. That directly relates to my project. But I am also interested in just documenting problems. Like the people spikes at City Walk. I guess that means I will have to go up there again.  I'm really going to need a studio to work in soon. I have no money though. I wish I knew someone who could rent me a corner of their space. I don't think I need much.

      I'm so bored at work. It is driving me crazy. I really do believe that I have read the entire Internet. At least the part that I am interested in. I have read every online art journel, design magazine, meme pool, blog, whatever. I should start soliciting reading material from my friends.  I heard from some interesting people today. I check my email every 5 minutes now. Steve Montgomery from school gave me some tips on possible jobs, but the problem is that their only hiring freelance and I just can't leave. It's killing me. I'm missing out on opportunites because I'm poor. This guy Dan, did say that he would talk to someone about getting a firmer offer from Stuart. I don't know what Steve said about me, but it must have been good. I guess I'm "known". I have whored my portfolio all over fucking town.  I heard about a job for Liz and DGS. Maybe. I haven't heard back from her. I think they are moving their studio soon, so they are probably all unplugged and boxed up. It sounded like a fun job too. I hope they don't miss out. I really want to get together with her again. A very simpathetic soul. I'll try to get a hold of her sometime next month. They should be moved in by then. I've been doing a lot of research into public art, the unsanctioned kind, and art collectives and public space. There is so much of that going on in Chicago for some reason. LA is so fragmented. I wonder how much an influence the geography and city layout has on that? I do believe that environment influences attitude. To me, LA seems like the perfect place to do something public and really make an impact. It's virgin territory in a way. I have to do the bench this weekend. Once I do one, I will feel more sure of myself. The project will have credibility.

      I contacted Liz, who gave me the contact for DSLR and I proposed my idea for the public seating project. Liz liked it, but I'm worried that it might not be radical enough for DSLR. I hope the people involved are really as open minded as they say. These sort of organizations always say something about not being all about art, but they never seem to really reach out beyond their activist/artist friends. I think that design is probably more valid in public space because public space is designed space. That is part of the problem. I want to approach it as problem solving, not just awareness raising. A lot of "awareness raising" art falls short, because it is so abstract and conceptual that the people you are trying to reach don't understand it, or it creates a problem that just pisses them off.  Liz said that someone she knows does this type of work, but art, and would have some good things to say about it. I hope she gets back to me. Even if this doesn't turn into a DSLR thing, I still want to do it. I like thinking of it as an ongoing project. Just fixing things that are wrong, or broken, or forgotten.  So, I had my teeth pulled. Being put out like that was weird. I didn't feel anything. I remember getting a little woozy, then I woke up and it was all over. I'm really swollen and numb, but the pain isn't so bad. Just a little sore. They gave me Vicodan, but if I take one I'm a complete vegetable. I'm a little worried about the numbness. It is my whole right side bottom. This can't be permanent. The doctor said there was a small chance of nerve damage, but he said it would only be about the size of a dime, if it happened. It's too early to worry.

      I'm having all four of my wisdom teeth extracted today. I have never had an operation before. Never been under anaethesia. I'm a little worried. I hope I'm not in too much pain afterwards. I scheduled it on a Friday, so I can convalesce over the weekend. I can't eat anything until after the operation, so of course, I'm starving and thirsty now.  I did some research on my tire project and found out that tire places cannot release old tires to the public. They have to account for each tire they remove and prove that they have shipped them to a recycling facility. I guess this is good news, but it has cause me to question the validity of the project. I don't know if it is more valid or less, since I know now that tires are treated as such dangerous things. I have to think about it more.

      I had a really good time last night. I went out to see some art with Jen and Amy. We went to Amy's gallery, 825, then we went to this space up in an office building in Chinatown. Jen's friend, Vito La Russo was showing at the Chinatown place. He was really good. Very labor intensive, hyper-real paintings. I usually don't like that kind of stuff  much, but I liked his. Really beautiful. After, we got Chinese food, and I think that Amy wanted to drink, but Jen begged me not to let her. They were driving home. Sometimes Amy does want to drink a lot. Not good when you are driving all the way back to Pomona. I said I was really tired, so they just went home. We had a good talk. I miss them. I wish they came out more. Last night was the first time that I noticed how frail Jen really is. She has a lot of trouble keeping herself balanced and straight when she is walking.   I contacted the woman from the Church of Craft this morning. I think they might be good to work with. I really want to get going on the tire chair. It is mostly a weaving project. They should be into that. They have meetings like a club. It would be good to meet people to collaborate with.

      I haven't written in months. I just had so much weird stuff to deal with. The beginning of the year didn't start out too well, but hopefully things are turning around.  The first thing I had to deal with was my Father's death. He was sick for so long, which is supposed to make it easier. In a way, it does, but I also think that the prolonged sickness made us all think that he would always get better. He always had. It was hard to take the last time seriously. He went so quick. I saw him on a Sunday, and in retrospect he didn't look good, but I really thought it would be OK again. He came home from the hospital on Monday and I was going to go out the following weekend, but my sister called me crying on Tuesday night saying that he wouldn't last that long. I went out the next day and he was just a vegetable. It was awful to see him like that. You just can't do anything. My mom and my Aunt and I just had dinner together in the dining room, with him sitting there with all the oxygen tubes and the noise of the machines going.  He died as I was driving home. My Mom called me on my cell phone. I'm glad I saw him one last time, but I have this horrible memory of what he looked like now. I can't get rid of it. It is like when my Grandfather died, and I was so happy that I didn't look into the coffin so I wouldn't remember him like that. Just the opposite.  Nobody wants to deal with death, but it is something you just can't hide from. Kym brought Tehya and Riley to the funeral. You just can't pretend that nothing happened. Adults like to pretend.  On the positive side of things, I think that I'm finally getting used to this idea of working somewhere crappy and doing other things. It is really always how I have lived my life, but I just got so used to spending 24 hours doing something I thought was meaningful. It is very hard for me to compartmentalize. I finished my website, almost. And I recently met these really great girls, Liz and Gretchen. They are graphic designers, but they also put out the art journal CakeWalk. They are involved around town. They want to work with me, and we became Friendsters, so hopefully I will see more of them. Tonight I'm going out with Amy and Jen to see some art.

      I went out to Claremont to see the shows at CGU last night. They were actually better than normal. There is just so much boring abstract painting going on there. It seems like the people graduating now aren't as good as the people in Amy's class. There is much more variety of work in her group. Amy did a really great wall sign piece based on the Wall Mart logo. She is totally into doing the October Surprise show with me. She's getting much more into doing installation. I'm happy to not have to do it alone. I drove around Highland Park yesterday and looked at potential sights. I have an idea of what I want to do, but I have to hang back until Amy gets involved. I do hope she likes my idea though. I think it is a good one.  It's so damn hot. I don't know what to do today to get out of the house. When I came home last night my sheets were hot like I had just taken them out of the dryer.  I'm going to go out for a drink with Franklin tonight.

      I went to the Panorama funeral yesterday. It was fun, but sad. There are just so many crappy, nothing buildings that could be torn down, but they have to pick one where something interesting is going on. It makes me really mad. I did hear that she may have a new space though. Somewhere near USC. It will be totally different, which isn't a bad thing. Huell Howser was there. Not filming. Just hanging out.   Afterwards, Mark and I were going to go to the Smell to see Franklin play, but the streets downtown were a mess from some sort of street fair. No parking and cops everywhere. We just went to Chinatown and had a drink.  I finally got the minutes from the DSLR meeting today. It looks like it will be a go. I'm so excited to be a part of something real. I hope Amy does want to do it with me.  That would be fun. This kind of political, public intervention isn't really her thing, but she seemed interested. She is just so bored with her boring instructors. I'm not sure about what to do though. The benches got some positive feedback from these people, but I wanted to do something new here. I need to do another bench this week. I have to keep going on that project.   I woke up from a nightmare last night. It was weird, but then aren't all nightmares? I burned up an espresso machine in my parent's kitchen. My Dad was there. The machine caught on fire and I had to put it in the sink.

      I didn't see or do much that was good this weekend. I saw Amy on Friday. We went to the Hammer party, which was kind of boring. Too crowded to see much and that is a show that you really have to concentrate on. Lots of small pictures of obscure performances. I don't know if it is worth going back. That kind of documentation is difficult for me. Amy and I had a good talk though. We went to Hop Louie's afterwards. We may try to work together on this show coming up in October. I think she is getting very frustrated with the traditional art practice thing already. Her teachers are telling her to paint for god's sake. Things are really the same everywhere. People and things like "artists" are being manufactured just like any other product. I hate it.  I'm going to do another bench this week. I'm thinking in front of Hollywood/Highland. The Tommy Helfiger has closed so there is a nice bit of space that isn't so visible, but still very high traffic. Street performers perform there too. I'm going to be more careful about casing the location to make sure that I at least get a photo of it in the space, if not with someone using it. I'm going to see how well patrolled it is early in the morning. This is actually the street, though I always have thought that Hollywood with the Walk of Fame thing has some sort of weird status.

      I went to see two political documentaries yesterday. They were part of a series running at Leamle's Fairfax. One was more arty, kind of a spoof on educational films. It was about reproductive rights. Really good. Lots of cleverly used found footage. The other was about the big peace protests in San Fran. In the end, they showed the protesters breaking through this sad, pitiful looking police "barricade" of four CHP on the Golden Gate bridge. I remember hearing that the protesters had gotten onto the Golden Gate. It was actually a really beautiful moment.  Seeing these ridiculous cops protecting nothing was so strange. Why didn't they go home? It was so weird and sad to me. The film ended with activists riding bikes down the center of the freeway on the bridge. It was a really beautiful gesture. It really flies in the face of the anti-anti-war movement, who always show up at marches with the signs reading "How did you get here? Oil!". No one is even pretending that they care about "oppressed peoples" anymore.   I'm supposed to go to the Hammer party tonight with Amy. I hope she still wants to go. Their parties are fun. I also haven't seen the show.

      Easter was OK. I felt out of sorts, a little. I left kind of early and I think that my Mom felt bad. I should try to take her out to lunch sometime soon. I'm sure that all the people that checked on her before are starting to drop off. That's always the way.  I saw an interesting movie last night. It was called "Morvern Callar". It had Samantha Morton in it. I like her. It was about this woman who's boyfriend commits suicide, then she "steals" his unpublished novel and publishes it, making a ton of money. It's not really as evil as it sounds. That is why I liked the movie. There isn't any background on her character or the status of the relationship at all. She never tells anyone that the boyfriend has died. The first scene is great. It is her and what looks like a man asleep in bed, she is kind of snuggling up to him. Then the camera pulls back and you can see that they are on the kitchen floor, and that he is dead. You never know if she has just gone a little crazy, or if she was always that way. Was the boyfriend a bad guy? If he is dead, is she really stealing anything from anyone? I'm really curious about the novel now. I like things that let you make your own decisions. I don't want to be preached at. Morality is much to complicated.

      The other night I was watching that show "Extreme Make Over - Home Edition" at a friend's house, and I was actually getting sucked into the drama. It felt sincere to me, but I'm embarrassed to admit that. I guess the premise is that they get "deserving families" to write in their sob stories, and the saddest one gets a new house. Not without precedent in TV. I do believe that good people should have a good place to live, I just wish that TV wasn't the only way for them to get it. This show is no way near as offensive as most of the other junk I saw advertised though. That "Swan" pageant, for example. Truly disgusting. The family I saw was a social worker, very young, with one natural daughter and two adopted sons that were previously in foster care. The house was your basic piece of crap tract home, totally falling apart. Of course, on a social workers salary the woman would never have the money to fix up the house. I can't deny that the show really helped these people. They were so happy, especially the kids. One of the boys started crying when he saw his room. Those kids probably came from horrible place that I could never even imagine. I was getting a little choked up watching, but now I feel dirty. TV always makes me feel dirty. It's the act of it being televised that bothers me somehow.

      I always end up talking about politics when I go out. It sucks. You can't not talk about it. That just contributes to the problem, but constantly going over the same depressing territory doesn't accomplish anything either. Almost all of my friends are out of work, facing deportation, and just plain scared and depressed. These are educated, talented people here. It's awful. I'm trying really hard to find alternatives for myself, and hopefully a few others, but it is still hard. I do believe that when the usual doors seem to be locked, it can force you to look in unusual places. That can be very good. Just not easy.  I've been reading a bit about this Thomas Kincaid show. I don't know that much about the curator, but I think he styles himself as a "provocateur". I'm all for questioning the purpose of art and exposing hypocrisies, but I'm not so comfortable here. Who is this show for anyway? The ironic hipster, po-mo grad student? I find something mean spirited about this. Thousands of people love this work. Most people hate and/or don't understand contemporary art. I think that YES, thousands of people can be wrong about art. Just because it is popular doesn't mean that it should be "elevated". That would destroy it. I think Thomas Kincaid is a genius, but he is not an artist. He is an industrial designer. Thousands of people cannot be wrong about design. His work functions perfectly, and people love it. He invents and manufactures mass produced goods. This has nothing to do with some sort of Warholian use of mass production techniques. Kincaid is Henry Ford, not Warhol or Koons. Why is this a bad thing? Though I do have this mental picture of his paintings being produced from some sort of "Snack-Master" like device before rolling off an assembly line.

      I've been noticing that when my mail is cancelled by the post office, the stamp has a picture of "Shrek" on it. It says "Greetings from Far, Far Away." Isn't that weird? I always thought that the US Mail was a government agency. How can they be advertising movies? Commemorative stamps are one thing, but this movie just came out last week.I thought they couldn't do stuff like this.

      I've gotten two pieces of "fan mail" in the last week from my website. I'm surprised that people are finding me. One girl said I was listed as a user on this site called "Herspace". I swear I have never heard of it. I guess I'm having black outs and signing up for online communities now. Weird. She said that she once took a design class but it was too hard, so now she has decided to be an artist instead. The other guy who emailed me was a student looking for inspiration. He asked me a bunch of questions about how I work. I tried to be helpful, but as it has been so long since I have "worked" it was sort of funny. I asked him where he went to school. I'm curious. This is nice.   I want to see the Bukowski doc today. Maybe this afternoon.  I guess the "occupation" is ending. I read a really great, scathing article in the Weekly last week about this. No troops are being pulled out, but at least they won't be "occupation" troops. How dumb does he think the American people are?  Oh wait, don't answer that.   Jimin is back in town now. We are all going to dinner on Sunday night.  The bench project is now done. I'm so glad. I was geting tired of it. I posted all the documentation on my site. I finished revamping it yesterday. I think it makes more sense now.

      Two benches went up yesterday without a hitch. I'm doing another today, and then I need more supplies. I'm happy that this project will be done so soon. I'm also revamping my website to make more sense of the different sort of projects that I do.   Jenn Wilkins is going to be in a group show next weekend, the 5th. At Revisited in Chinatown. It seemed like an OK place. I saw the woman who runs it at Liz's studio thing last week. She seems nice.  Shelly is going to be in town next week. She is only free for one night, then she goes up the San Fran. with her brother. I hope I get to see her. I always really liked her. She said they are trying to put together some dinner, or drinks, or something for Thursday night.  I haven't called anyone lately. I haven't heard from Hae Won in a while. It is hard to talk to school people sometimes. Everyone is so depressed. Everyone just bitches and moans. I feel compassion, but I think that part of their problem is that they are relying to heavily on the "JOB" to fulfill their life. No one is doing anything on their own. Just reworking their portfolios, like that is going to be some sort of magic thing. They just don't get the concept of doing something for creative fulfillment, not just for financial reasons. If they can't bring it to market, they don't know what to do. They get all paranoid about their ideas being stolen. When I got the thing in ReadyMade, someone asked me if I got a patent. "How did I protect myself?" She completely missed the whole point of the piece. I don't think that anyone would steal anything from me, because no one is selling anything right now anyway. It's sad. They are all really smart people, but they just don't think. It's worse now with everyone being depressed and worried.

      That interview actually turned out to be pretty good yesterday. I have a much better feeling about this place now. I think the money is going to be really good. It's strange. They made me name a figure, and then they said it was much too low. I really have no idea how much a real "designer" makes. I would just like to be able to pay my bills and have a better apartment.   I found out about a couple of online consignment shops. I want to redo the cuff bracelets as a real product. Even the guys yesterday thought they would sell, and that place is pretty conservative. Both places sell 60/40, and I would get paid at the end of each month.   I'm going to do half of the benches today. I can only haul so much in my car. As soon as this project is done, I'm going to start on the cuffs.   I wonder if Amy is back in town. We should start meeting and talking about October Surprise soon. I feel kind of stressed about it. I want to do something really good.

      I picked my sites for the benches yesterday. I'm going to do 6 of them along Glendale Blvd., between Alvarado and Silver Lake. I'm excited to finally wrap this up. I should be done early next week. I don't think these will be hard to document. The streets are pretty deserted in the afternoon, and there is no surveillance to worry about. I wonder how long they will stay up? I can't imagine anyone would take them down, unless people stole them, which is totally fine with me. I think doing this along a defined route is a lot better in terms of having a well defined project. People can understand what my point is without me going into a long explanation. I learned in school that if I talked for longer than about 10 minutes, I was probably about 50% bullshit. I'm also going to start restructuring my website, to better show projects as complete.   I have another interview at that soft goods place today. I thought they had forgotten about me, but I guess not. I still feel weird about it. It is so damn far to drive, but what can I do? The people seem sort of nice, but boring. That is just what the world is, I think. Sort of nice, but boring people. I hope they offer decent money at least.

      I went to the Sunscreen Project at M&A, www.emanate.org on Saturday. It was really fun. I learned to crochet. It wasn't that hard. I am kind of inspired by it. It was oddly satisfying, and kind of obsessive. I couldn't stop doing it. It was weird. Keeping your hands busy, without much mental excursion. I guess that people like to do this now because it is this traditional women's craft. Edith, the woman who organized this thing, is an artist who deals with feminism and uses hand crafts in her work. I think this screen will be quite pretty when it is done. I started thinking about what other materials I could crochet into products. I really want to try to get some little things taken by shops or websites soon. I want to remake the wrist cuffs into something salable. I contacted this site called good-together that sells cool stuff. There is also this vegan boutique that has some interesting products. Everyone is kind of closed mouthed about submission policies though. It is hard.  I went to Liz's open studio on Friday. It was OK, but everyone knew each other and it was hard.  I went to have a drink to celebrate Franklin's dissertation on Sunday. It was fun.  I went to go see "Kill Bill Vol II". I didn't like it. It was kind of boring actually.  I think I'm going to reorganized the bench project into something that deals just with transportation, bus stops, formal use of public space. I want to pick a street, maybe Temple or Alvarado, and do benches all along it at intervals. I think this will make a tighter, more easily understood project. This is also something that I can finish and document as complete. I need to have that in my portfolio.  The furniture designer contacted me back. He said "I like your work" (who doesn't?) and asked if I was currently employed. Hopefully he will set up an interview this week.

      I'm supposed to go to Liz's open studio thing this evening. I'm curious to see the studio, and maybe meet more people involved in October Surprise. Her husband will most likely be there. He is one of the main organizers. I want to go to the Found Magazine thing too. It should be fun, but I don't know if I will make it.   Mark is sick.  Rush Limbaugh's recent comments are the most vile things I have heard in a long time. Unbelievable.  I went to go see "Coffee & Cigarettes" yesterday. I liked it, but not all the episodes are very good. In a way, that is what I liked about it. It built up some anticipation. "Oh, is this one going to be good?"  "Why are people gay? I don't get it" Shortly followed by, "How do you get AIDS?"---Truly horrible, and ridiculously ignorant neighbor boys.

      I've been watching the DVD's of that show "Freaks & Geeks". It was such a great show. I think about the only show I've seen that was real about being a teenager. I remember thinking this when it was on, but I never saw very many episodes. The three "geeks" are interesting because they are a bit archetypical in their differentness, but still oddly realistic. There is the Jew (racial outcast),the nerd (social outcast) and the little shrimpy guy (physical outcast).The little guy is by far the most angst ridden about his status, but his position is the most temporary.I think this is significant. The Jewish kid will always be a Jew.  This gives him strength. He's more sophisticated about it. Kind of an "Einstein was a nerd too" sort of attitude. The super nerdy guy is a lost cause. He doesn't care really. His idiosyncrasies give him strength. The little guy is constantly making a huge deal out of things that no one else would really notice if he just left it alone. Very teenager-like. A pretty profound message that isn't wrapped up inside a saccharine package.  That's sadly rare.

      Another thing I thought about "Super-Size Me"...    I think I was so shocked by the size of things because fastfood companies never do any sense of scale in their ads.Their  "product shots" never include hands, or other recognizable objects like usual product shots. This convention is used in all product photography, from cars to electronics to furniture. In the fastfood industry, they may show different sizes of things next to each other, but (to my knowledge) I have never seen an ad with a person holding up a coke or some fries. It would look ridiculous. People may be eating the food, but you don't really know what it is they are eating exactly. They definitely are not eating the super-sized portions. This adds more weight to the argument that the fastfood industry knows they are doing harm to people. Or at least pushing a ridiculous, useless product.

      Hae Won told me yesterday that she had to pawn some stuff because she ran out of money for the month. She said the shop wouldn't even give her half of the worth, and she was asking me if that was usual. I have no idea, but I told her that I thought it seemed like what a pawnshop would give. I've never been in a pawnshop before. She said the guy was creepy and dirty,no surprise. The experience seems to be just like how anyone would think that pawning stuff to buy food would be like. Truly horrible. She swore me to secrecy, but no one who knows her has access to this blog. My friends travel in widely diverse circles. Not much over lap. I feel so bad for her. She technically could have asked her parent's to wire her some money, but she feels really ashamed. Her brother is in grad school at Johns Hopkins, and her parent's are not wealthy. Having her out of work is a big strain on them. When Jimin gets here there will probably be a big dinner thing, so I told Hae Won that I would pay for her dinner, and just tell everyone that I owed her or something. It's about all I can do. I'm in no position to help anyone financially, but I totally would if I could.     I went to the new green area of the LA River yesterday. There is a little park. I actually saw some long legged birds that kind of impressed me. They were nothing like what used to live by the river, but I didn't expect any wildlife at all. The LA "River" is truly surreal, as is much of LA, as everyone knows. I kind of like it that way, though I know that ecologically it is terrible. There is this clump of trees and brush right in the middle of the aqueduct, and it smells kind of oceany. Sort of bad, but not as bad as expected. Of coarse, all the walls are covered in graffiti. Some of it is pretty elaborate. This feeling of not expecting much from my city is interesting. All the people I know who are really into "the city" are all from other places. This notion of the outsider caring more that the insider is kind of what I want to deal with for the October Surprise project.

      I went to see "Super-Size Me" today. It was really great. It did get hard to watch. You don't know how much he camped it up, but he really did look sick and exhausted by the end. I have never super-sized anything in my life. It was weird to see just how huge those sodas and fries really are. He was a big guy, but the food still looked like a joke in his hands. It's crazy. This movie is a good example of getting useful, "good", political information out to the masses. It was entertaining, but still packed with data that was quite straight forward. This is what Michael Moore does well, though I know he annoys a fair few also.  Yesterday I went out to see the new ArtCenter campus. It's pretty cool. Very weird levels. I imagine it would be totally confusing on your first day of classes. Is that good architecture? This is a problem for me. Architecture as an object. It looks cool in model form, but is it useful? I don't know. This is my problem with a lot of design. Something that is an intellectual puzzle for the designer, becomes celebrated by the critics, but the people using it hate it. What to do about that? How do you push perceptions of what something can be, but not alienate your audience? I do believe that the audience is always important. You need them.

      I went to a really interesting gallery yesterday. It is called Machine Project, and it is in Echo Park, right next to the Echo Park Film Center. I heard about it from Liz Anderson a while ago, but just never got around to going in. It isn't open very long hours. I think it is run by just one guy, so that is understandable. The show was amazing. It was all process art, but pretty extreme stuff. The main piece was an armature that had oysters growing on it that were real. It took 2 1/2 years for the oysters to grow. The result looked like some sort of sea monster's backbone. Very cool. The other pieces were mushrooms that had been forced to grow into different shapes. You were supposed to see specific things in the shapes, but none of them were posted. A very nice, restrained use of wall text. It didn't tell you exactly what you were supposed to see. I actually didn't see anything. Just oddly shaped mushrooms. The guy that owns the gallery said on his website that he opened the place with some money he made in the dot-com boom. He's some tech guy. Now that is what I like to hear. Someone who has the guts to admit that things don't just materialize out of thin air.   I also watched "The Fog of War" yesterday. It was riveting. I knew next to nothing about McNamara, but I had heard the expression "McNamara's War" in reference to Vietnam. He started to remind me of Colin Powell. I also think that Powell has come to hate his job, and have deep differences with the present administration, but they are both such "systems" guys. They stay within the system and take orders, but they don't completely stop thinking. I think that Powell will have some really interesting things to say when this is all over. I wonder if he will wait until he is 85 to do it though? I heard somewhere once that the only true pacifist is someone who has seen war. This film reminded me of "Uncovered" too. Both films were so powerful because they used statements from people who were really inside what is happening in the government.If a liberal, anti-war activist tells you some conspiracy story it just doesn't have the weight as when an ex-government official tells the same story. There was a particularly chilling moment in the film when McNamara told about going to a reconciliation meeting with some North Vietnamese officials after the war. One man yelled at him and said "Haven't you ever read a history book? How could you believe that we were puppets of the Chinese? We had been fighting China for a 1000 years. We were fighting for our independence from YOU."  That really reminded me of Iraq. So scary.

      I went to that new restaurant on Hollywood 'Zero-One' last night. It was way too hip. Annoying. It is owned by a graphic design collective. Weird. I really didn't feel like I was in LA at all. It had a slick, San Francisco vibe to it. That's why I hate San Fran. LA hip is still a little grungy, and even though I know it is a pretense, it doesn't bother me as much as a super groomed type of hip. I feel comfortable wearing whatever I feel like in LA, but in other cities if you stumble upon some hip place not dressed like everyone else, people stare. The food was weird too. "Asian Collective Cuisine" What the fuck? I had duck pizza. I'm crazy. It was terrible, but I will say that just because I didn't like it, it might still have been prepared well. I don't know much about food. The chef was super young, and well, 'hip'. Oh, and the waiter MAY have had a fake English accent. I don't really know, but I like to think that it was fake.   I think that the word 'collective' is starting to bother me the same way that 'indie' used to. I believe in collectives and collectivism, but it is getting hard to tell a real one from just a bunch of hipsters who really don't have to work. A collective is supposed to be about people grouping together to support each other outside of traditional systems. It's not just an excuse to say that you are doing something creative without really having a job. Just because no one is paying you a wage, it doesn't mean that you belong to a 'collective'. Wealthy hipsters, at least in LA, always seem to be drawn into things that have their roots in working class, or Marxist ideologies. Upper class guilt? The romanticism of slumming? Maybe this is what killed indie rock too?

      There has been a lot of violence in my neighborhood lately. Last night something happened, though I don't know exactly what. I heard a woman scream really loud, then it got super quiet. Everytime something bad happens it gets so quiet. No TV's, radios, even cars seem to disappear. It wasn't late. This morning I saw three cop cars and they were still talking to this bunch of Armenian women. Were they here all night? Last week someone got hit by a car and died. There is a shrine on Hollywood. About a month ago I heard an actual exchange of gunfire. It went on for about 5 minutes, and again it was so creepily quiet. I never heard any cop cars. Probably no one called them. I'm never really sure if I'm hearing real gunshots, but this was an exchange, so I'm pretty sure. It's the quiet that wakes me up, I think. I feel this is relate to all the violence in the world right now. And the fact that the government is being run by criminals. I think people feel it, even if they aren't aware of it. That's my crackpot theory for the day.

      I think that I may have had the best sandwich ever yesterday at Langer's deli. I always shy away from naming something the "best". I like to think that the best hasn't happened to me yet, especially when you talk about the "best day of my life" or something like that. But really, this was the BEST sandwich. It made me want to write about it. Bree was speechless. I don't think I can do it justice, but the corned beef, with coleslaw and Russian dressing on rye bread is highly recommended. Also the pastrami. That's what Bree had.   It was nice having lunch with Bree. We walked through MacArthur Park, which I had never done. It is filthy, and the lake smells terrible. I guess I'm not surprised. We did see a crazy mural that said "Lots of things we eat come from the ocean..." Then it had a drawing of a fish, some toothpaste, and MILK. It must be that whale's milk that is so popular nowadays. Bree gave me a great hat. It's like a stewardess from the 60's.  Jimin is coming back to LA for a while.I called her last night. Her Visa issue seems all mysterious. She wouldn't talk about it. She probably has some scam. Maybe she got married. She's coming on the 20th. I'll be glad to see her.

      I took a bunch of pictures for Liz Clayton's website yesterday. There is a new Thai place inside the old Taco Bell that Franklin pointed out to me the other night, and I took some of the Thai Express and the big hotdog. I love that place! I would be so sad if someone took down the hotdog.   I'm thinking about "The Society for Public Improvements" for my project name. SPI isn't so bad. I got some great WPA era posters off the Library of Congress's website. That's a really good resource. I hadn't looked at it before. I'm trying to see if I can have two different domain names under one hosting plan. I'm not using anywhere near all my webspace with my other website. I think that I may not be able to though.  I built a new bench yesterday. I'm going to wait until the weekend to put it up. Less people on the road early in the morning. I'm using it as a little table right now. I might miss it.   Jimin called the other night. I have to call her back today. Her Visa expires in June. She should be leaving really soon for Korea. It is so sad.   I'm going to go have lunch with Bree today. We are going to walk to Langer's deli from her house. It should be fun. I always thought she was interesting, but I felt that saying she was "interesting" would put her off. I mean interesting sincerely, not "interesting". There is a difference.     Franklin got his doctorate the other day. "Filed" as they say. I'm happy for him.

      I had my interview yesterday. It went really well, but I'm so nervous about getting trapped in a terrible place again. The guys were nice, but maybe a little weird. It was just such a square place. I'm having a really hard time with that. All the "cool" places are struggling. No one can hire. I just haven't completely reconciled myself to this day job thing. I know practically that it is the only way to survive, but I still feel so trapped being in a dumb office 8+ hours a day. I guess I will just get used to it.  I watched a little of that show "The Swan" last night. It was so boring. Really. It was just dumb. I don't understand how anyone could watch it. Sometimes I try to watch TV, just to see what people like. I end up feeling so estranged. I'm proud and depressed at the same time.   I'm going to go out and take a picture of "Jons" market for Liz Clayton today. She requested one for her site. I'm glad Franklin told me about her site. It is really cool. I don't know her much at all, but we seem to have some common interests. I'm also going to build my next bench. I had to borrow a drill from Mark. I also need to start looking at WPA era graphics and getting a name for my public projects. I thought of The Society for the Improvement of Public Space, but that makes 'SIPS', which sounds silly. I don't want a random acronym.

      So Blogger is all shiny and new now. I changed my template, but I really don't like it. I can't change the font in the template for some reason. I do have comments enabled, which could be fun. Not that anyone reads this.  There is a film series starting at UCLA about LA. They are all films that show different views of Los Angeles, both fiction and documentary. On Friday they are showing that film "The Exiles" + a doc on Bunker Hill. I may go.  I have that weird job interview today. Walnut is just so far, even if they are cool people. I'm not getting my hopes up though. The guy sounded strange on the phone.   I got a really bizarre call this Saturday from a guy who got my resume, but then didn't identify himself at first. He just said he was "Lance from ArtCenter" and started asking me all these hyper questions about my "big vision". I thought it was some sales call. Honestly, 10 AM on a Saturday morning?! I finally got him to identify himself and he turned out to be from a sort of interesting company that does green development and construction. They are designing a series of products for the Tree People, who are an organization that does urban tree planting. I have heard about them. That guy is a freak though. I think I may have blown it, but I don't think there would be money or any security in it. Just an interesting side project. He seemed to want more of a commitment though. He sounded like he wanted a disciple.   I'm kicking around the idea of putting my public projects under some sort of organizational umbrella. I do think they should be organized and not just thrown in with my other more "straight" design projects. I like the idea of having a "fake" organization along the lines of an old WPA project. Call it something like "The Dept. Of Public Works" or "The Society for the Reassessment of Public Space".  Something like that.

      I got an interview for Monday at this small media storage company. They are in Walnut. Kind of weird. This is just the type of company I wanted to avoid, but I'm not in a position to refuse much. I have to see what kind of impression I get from them. I'm not working for another sweatshop. I could do almost anything if I believed that the people care about what they are doing. It's terrible to be stuck in an office with a bunch of other miserable people who hate their boss. Not that everyday has to be "fun", but I hate to be around negative people. It's not professional.  I heard about this project at the M&A where a sun screen for their backyard is going to be knitted out of old plastic bags. Anyone can come and they will teach you how to knit. I love recycling projects. It sounds fun.

      I got more wood to make another bench yesterday. I haven't been able to park close enough to my apartment to unload it yet. That sucks.  I contacted this acquaintance of an acquaintance yesterday who works at Black & Decker about a possible job. I didn't know they were looking for anyone, but it looks like they are. Designing tools may not be so bad. I definitely think there is a need for them. That is my main problem with consumer product design-the lack of real need for most of the things produced. I hope I get an interview at least. I want to do better things with my website. I should ask Bill to tutor me. What I want is simple, but I don't know the terminology well enough to look it up in a book. I can never find what I need. I would like to do more with photos. Just add more content, with roll-overs.

      I saw two hideous things yesterday. 1: an advertisement for the photography show at the Getty showing the famous Man Ray photo of a woman as a violin with the woman's body completely airbrushed out, so she looks like she is wearing a dress with violin marks on it. 2: "The 10 Commandments - The Musical" No, I didn't actually see the musical, just the ad, which was more than enough. I swear that was a Simpson's episode, or something very much like it.  These two things are definitely related.  I also saw something not hideous. I saw "Men With Guns". The only other John Sayles movie I have seen is "Lone Star" which was much more Hollywood. I also watched "Sylvia" the Sylvia Plath bio-pic. It was OK. That type of movie is always difficult. I can't deny that her life was kind of melodramatic and "filmic", but it still ends up being a little grating. I have always been interested in the Plath/Hughes myth. Gweneth Paltrow did an OK job, I guess. I need to get more John Sayles. MWG was really great.

      I saw some Yvonne Rainer films last night. They were really good and she was a great speaker. Sometimes Q&A's are so awful. The audience stammers and the artist bullshits. Rainer was very articulate and smart, but not pretensious. It's sad how rare that has become. Maybe because she is a lot older than most of the people around now still doing art?  She is the most spry 70 year old I have ever seen. The new film she showed was quite political, but very beautiful and subtle. It had quotes from or about various modern artists from Austria-Hungary. Loos, Kokoshka, Klimt, etc. It talked about the death of the Empire and the rise of modernism, but also the confusion/corruption of artists sucked into bourgeois culture as a means of survival. Still very relevant today. I loved it.

      I saw "Fahrenheit 9/11" yesterday. I had heard that it was much more subdued that previous Michael Moore things. Not much interventionist antics, that sort of thing. It was true, but I definitely wouldn't call this film "subdued". Moore always brings up issues of just what is propaganda. The film had a lot of rough images of screaming, bleeding babies and gloating soldiers. At one point, some soldiers were explaining what songs they had playing through their helmets while they were in battle. That was the most shocking thing for me. It was like a video game to them. It made them out to be so child-like, but still so ugly. I don't know if that scene helped Moore's point or not. He was definitely going after the issue of the military recruiting in poor areas, and scooping up marginalized youth to do "our" dirty work. On the other hand, there were still audible gasps in the theater when some of the information about Haliburton, and other blatant profiteering was put forth. I think of that stuff as common knowledge by now, but I'm sure it still isn't. Or maybe people just don't want to believe. We went to the first show, so we got right in, but when we exited the theater there were huge lines. I heard it has been sold out all weekend. People bought in advance for the Los Feliz theater. I saw it in Glendale. A pretty normal, suburban crowd. I always forget that LA is such a special place. So much more liberal that most of the country, and LA is such a tiny pocket inside the state. I truly don't understand how most of the country thinks. I always think about the story of Spaulding Gray getting booed in Houston for simply expressing "sadness" at the beginning of the war. He didn't say anything more liberal than that. He was just sad. How could anyone not be regardless of their politics? Maybe not taking war seriously is the most distressing thing for me. It's a video game, a football game, to most people. It's just so sad.

      I'm going to go see "Farenheight 9/11" this weekend. I do like Michael Moore, though I understand why he annoys some people. He can go a little overboard on the emotional stuff. Some would say manipulative, and I would agree, but I also think that desperate times call for desperate measures. He is definitely a "regular guy" and that is what the left needs so bad. Being on some high horse against manipulating people has hurt left leaning causes so much. They just get trounced when the opposition fights dirty and then wonder why no one cares. It is sad, but a reality. I always thought that the only way for something like the NEA to exist in any real capacity would be for them to be run by some cut throat professional politician who is just doing it for money and acclaim. I know it will never happen, but I always have this fantasy of some 100 year old, southern (he has to be from the south), man (he has to be male)running them. He could go into Congress and convince them that not funding the arts makes them all look like red necks, which would make them throw money at things that they don't understand, like they do with scientific research. Gore was the "science nerd" candidate. We could have an "art nerd" candidate.   Cut + Paste is finally getting to putting up my stuff. She said in about a week. I don't know if she is just over worked, having some temporary problems, or a flake. I'm a little nervous. We'll see how it goes. I haven't sold any planes from Blissen. I wonder if they just aren't a commercial project. She lowered the price already. Honestly, I wouldn't pay $7 for them. I want to try doing something "cute" for them next time. I really want to make bracelets out of old tapes. Crochet them. They could be labeled what they are/were. I don't know if that is cute enough. They would just be brownish grey.

      My Blissen product is finally up on their website. It looks good. The photos look cute. I'm not wild about the name or the intro text, but what are you going to do? I wonder how long Cut + Paste will take to update theirs?  I had a job interview today. It came as kind of a surprise. They called this morning, very early. It's architectural, outdoor lighting. Not innovative, but very high quality. Nice people that seem to like each other. I don't know how I did. I've decided that I don't know how to read people at all. I'm not even going to speculate.   I'm going to try to get the planes placed in a project through Temporary Services that is going to happen in three different locations in Europe. Free newspaper boxes that have art stuff inside. It's not really juried, but he did ask for descriptions, then he would give more details on shipping and stuff. I hope I get "accepted". I don't know how successful the planes would be in Iceland though.

      I worked a bit on ideas for O.S today, then went to Flor Y Canto to work on the Sunscreen project. I took some photos on Figueroa. I'm thinking about doing something about re-used commercial space. You see so much of it in a neighborhood like Highland Park. I always think it looks cool (in an un-ironic way) to be able to see the old defunct signs on buildings that have totally different businesses operating inside them now. I'm thinking that this shows a more "natural" ebb and flow of economic conditions and cultural and social needs, then say when a Starbuck's moves into a space and obliterates any history that the building may have once had. And really who NEEDS a $4 coffee? This is how I can tie it back to the main concept behind O.S. Some of the signs are very hard to see unless you are looking and standing in the right spot. This ties into my other concept of doing something dealing with tourism and the notion of being "ready" to see something. I'm going to create "Scenic Vistas" or "Look-out Points" in order to see the history left behind on the buildings. Maybe with binoculars or spy glasses or something.

      As of this Monday (I think), I will officially be an "entrepreneur". I have had two products accepted for submission this week. The paper airplanes are finished and Blissen is supposed to update their website, plus place them in this vegan boutique in San Fran. called Otsu. Cut + Paste has also accepted the wrist cuffs and I sent them out yesterday. I'm more excited about Blissen because it is more of a collaborative relationship. Cut + Paste is just a store really, but I'm so curious to see how they do. I won't make any real money, but it could lead to other things. Blissen seems to get a lot of press.  I went out with Amy, Bill and Kristi yesterday. We saw some art at 6150, then had drinks at The Bounty, then Amy and Bill and I went to this screening thing at The Knitting factory. It was a good day. There were some strange paintings at 6150. Acme had these sort of "southern gothic" creepy things that seemed to have a narrative running through them, but you couldn't really tell. The style was so odd. I can't tell if I liked them or not. They were definitely "unique". They almost looked like Thomas Kincaid (I guess he's ironically hip now), but the figures were almost puppet like. High level of skill, which is hard to find these days. Then there were these faux renaissance portraits that were definitely pretty dense with imagery and metaphor. The skill level was pretty impressive. Lots of drapery and jewels, and ladies holding fire underwater. "Skill" and "beauty" seem to be back. I'm glad, but it does come off as a bit tricky sometimes. It's hard to tell. Daniel Weinburg always shows hard-edge pattern stuff. It is always well done, but it just depends on whether or not you like that sort of thing. Sometimes I do. The narrative or figurative stuff always brings up "wall text" questions for me. If a work is literally saying something shouldn't people know what it says?  Reading off a wall is so pedantic and just kind of a drag too, but is it necessary for certain sorts of shows? I think that a ridged adherence to "death of the author" has fallen out of fashion, but are people afraid of seeming to pander or are they just so immersed in a small world that they never think that anyone outside of their own circle would see the work anyway? Sometimes openness of interpretation (see what you want) and snobbishness (I don't care if you don't get it) can look like the same thing.

      I went to a huge art show at ArtCenter last night with Amy and Mark. It was better than I expected, just super crowded. I felt all over stimulated like a hyper-active 4 year old. There was some great stuff, thought I don't remember much of it. I will have to go back. I was worried that the show would just be boring and weird. Too many artists showing in too small of a space. I was expecting strange, distracting juxtapositions, but it was OK. The space was used well. Lots of sound pieces, some cool looking video. That's the stuff that I need to go back to see again. It LOOKED cool, but it was too crowded to really see. There was this one piece that was a gigantic speaker with a DJ station on a truck behind it. Just huge. It was emitting a sort of thrumming drone, and then periodically they would crank it up and blast some music. I thought it was great because it was just such a ridiculous thing. The artist was so excited whenever they turned it on. He was literally jumping with glee. It was very "boy with ridiculously large, superfluous toy". It's just so good to see someone really enjoy doing something.

      I met Liz for drinks last night. We went to Hop Louie's, then to the Mountain. It was Mountain's 1 year anniversary. They had 1/2 price drinks and some food. I finally met her husband Steve. He seems really nice. There were lots of interesting people there. It was fun.  My seed paper came yesterday, but I missed the delivery guy. It should come today. I'm excited to finally start making some planes.   The call for October Surprise is finally up and posted. Amy and I have to talk about what we are going to do. I may see her tonight.  I watched "The Tin Drum" yesterday. That little boy was truly disturbing. I thought he was a real little kid at first, but now I'm not so sure. Midget, or no? I didn't realize it was so old; 1979. I have never read any Gunther Grass. I should.

      Jen's show was nice. Her stuff looked really good. I didn't stay very long.  I saw the Harry Potter movie. It wasn't very good. It looked amazing though. I used to be able to enjoy a movie that was so-so, but still had a great "look". I guess my interest in movie visuals has peaked. Everything looks "real", so where do you go from there?  I heard that David Hasselhoff is releasing a rap record under the name "The Hoff". That's his rap name. I guess I can't use it now.  I'm trying to get together with Amy and Liz this week. Not together.   No sprouts yet.  I should have the flower paper by mid-week, so I can get going on the planes.

      I went to an opening at Sci-Arc last night. It was someone who went to school with Mark. It was weird, I was convinced that I knew who the guy was, but it turned out to be a totally different guy. When I questioned Mark about who the guy that I thought it was WAS, he had no idea who I was talking about. I tried to describe him and everything, but Mark had no idea. The show was interesting. It was an installation using the standard 2 x 4 foot dropped ceiling grid, but with these really cool formed plastic panels, that gave the ceiling an undulating, but still geometric surface. Somehow it all had something to do with John Cage. I read it in the brochure. This is where it starts to loose me. I thought it was just a really good reinterpretation of a boring architectural  convention. It worked. The John Cage business, I'm not so sure of. Something about "randomness". Architects seem to be into using music lately.  Jen's show is tonight.  The Sunscreen project meets again today. I wish I had more bags to bring.  No sprouts yet. I'm watering everyday. It's pretty hot back there.  I have two possible "collectives" going on now. Blissen is totally hot and bothered about the paper airplanes, but now I'm having trouble getting the material. I didn't expect such a quick, positive response. I jumped the gun a little. It will work out though. It's the same deal where they do all the packaging, shipping, billing and I give them a cut. But at Blissen, it is more of an ongoing relationship with more opportunity to collaborate. Cut+Paste is really just a store.

      Hae Won told me that when she was still living in Korea, "Beverly Hills 90210" was in syndication over there. She and her friends were totally addicted to it. They watched it every week. But one week, it just disappeared from the air with no warning. The government had decided that it was getting a little too "racy" and they pulled it off. So, since Hae Won and all her friends were hooked on the show, they got one of her friend's brothers, who was in school in the US, to watch and write them the story lines from here so they would know what happened to Brenda.   I got wildflower seeds and planted them in the alley behind my apartment. I hope no one messes with them. These sort of projects always remind me about the time that some people from the Panarama spent an entire day weeding and planting the strip of dirt between the street and the sidewalk. It looked really nice, and they had planted cactus, and put some ornamental rocks, so it wouldn't need much cultivation. But over night someone vandalized it. Totally tore it up maliciously. It seemed so wastefully mean. Why take the time? But then, maybe there is something inherently offensive about a bunch of white kids who probably all have MFA's going into a neighborhood and wasting an entire day on flowers. Most people that live here don't have that kind of time. But then, someone still found the time to be mean.

      I finally read the NY Times "Mea Culpa" apology article today. I'm really glad that they printed something like that, but it was still a bit "weasely" for me. I'm trying so hard not to be bitter about it, too. Most more liberal news/commentary sources are so bitter and pissed off about it. I totally agree, though. It is a bit "too little, too late". And NOT on the front page, though they are starting to run stories about faulty intelligence and the other scandals, but isn't that just the same thing they always did? Run the big scandals on the front page? I've had a bit of a problem with the NY Times ever since after Sept 11. I used to read it religiously, because I thought it was a vastly superior paper to say, the LA Times. It surely still is, but it is still just a paper. It is just another large, corporately owned media outlet. I don't know exactly who owns the Times, but they are definitely not independent. I know that everyone has an agenda, and everyone is slanted. There is no such thing has a truly independent, "objective voice". I just hate when things are reported as the "truth". "WE are the NY TIMES. WE are better". That is the real problem, I think. At least if I read Guerilla News or something, I know I'm going to get an angry rant, and I can process it as such.

      I got my first comment from a stranger yesterday. That is supposed to be the point of publishing a public blog, but I still got kind of excited about it. It's silly.   I found out that the flower planting project that I was planning is also an assignment from "Learning to Love You More". I'm going to do it for them instead. It's a good project to participate in. www.learningtoloveyoumore.com   I saw Jimin on Sunday. She was just the same. It was weird having dinner in Pasadena. It was really just like we were still in school. I don't know exactly how I feel about that. I'm glad she is back. She only has two months to find a job, then she will have to leave for sure.  My rent is being raised. Only $21, but still.  I have the cuffs 90% made. I'm going to finish them and get the forms filled out for the consignment website thing today. I'm just curious if anyone will really buy them.  I saw "Saved" yesterday. I wanted to hate Mandy Moore, but I couldn't. She was pretty good actually. There were some funny/clever parts, but it was pretty much light, teen-age fare. A decent holiday weekend movie.   I saw a photo of the woman who won "The Swan" in the market today. She looks exactly like her before photo, just smiling with make-up on. A wish fulfillment fantasy that doesn't really change anything. What does that mean? I doubt this has any deep, existentialist-type meaning. It would be great if it did. I guess she got on TV. Isn't that every American's dream?

      I may have a really exciting job, but I'm still nervous about it. They are supposed to call me today with an offer, which I am in no position to refuse, but until I actually see it I can't believe it. It is a landscape architecture studio that specializes in water features.&nbsp; Called  urlLink Fluidity . &nbsp;Kind of weird, but they seem to really, REALLY want me. They are almost all architects, but they want to have a multi-disciplinary team, so they want a product designer. It's still weird. Jimin called me&nbsp; last night and we had dinner, and I was still in shock. My stomach was hurting actually. I think from the stress. She wants me to call her as soon as I hear today.   Jimin&nbsp;got a job at Ford. It is huge money, and she gets to stay in the US, but she is not so happy about it. Because of Jon, mostly. She also said that Detroit is absolute hell. I think that she has to stay a year for the visa. I'm so happy for her, but it was strange to see her unhappy about such a seemingly happy thing. It is sad really. To leave a great boyfriend, all your friends, have to live in Detroit, and then the only compensation is financial.&nbsp;She was even joking that there is nowhere to shop in Detroit. &nbsp;She said that all the men at Ford had khaki pants pulled up almost&nbsp;to their armpits. Very strange environment for her. There is going to be a party this Friday for her, which hopefully will turn out to be a joint party for me.&nbsp; She has to leave next week.   I saw the Rodney Graham show on Sunday with Franklin and Bree. He did a talk/walk through.&nbsp; He's a good speaker.&nbsp; There was a lot of stuff that I hadn't ever seen before.&nbsp; I liked the text stuff, but it brought up museum viewing issues for me.&nbsp; That sort of stuff is really difficult within the traditional&nbsp;viewing parameters. A few pieces were supposed to be spun around on these stands so you could see that the text looped.&nbsp; But of coarse, you can't touch anything in a museum.&nbsp; If Graham wasn't standing there telling us, I don't think I would have understood. &nbsp;

       Amy is&nbsp; (or was) &nbsp;seriously ill.&nbsp; I thought she was just being a freak when she didn't return any of my calls.&nbsp; It's so bad.&nbsp; She is one of those people who could be dead on her kitchen floor, and people would just think that she was screening her calls or something.&nbsp; Her Mom called me yesterday.&nbsp; She had some kind of "virus".&nbsp; West Nile?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; She didn't elaborate.&nbsp; It's weird, because I was getting upset at her, but&nbsp;it still was in the back of my mind, "What if she IS sick?"&nbsp; She told me that she wasn't feeling well on Saturday, but you never really think that anyone is&nbsp;actually sick.&nbsp; It would have been&nbsp;better if she was just being anti-social.     Mark is going away to the East Coast for a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;His family has rented a beach house in Connecticut. It's his Aunt's 50th anniversary&nbsp;of being a nun! Cause for celebration. What does a nun get on an anniversary?&nbsp; 50 spankings?&nbsp;Mark does need a vacation more that just about anyone I know.

      I got my "Defend America: Defeat Bush" bumper sticker in the mail yesterday.  urlLink Move on  was giving out free ones. I've always had a problem with bumper stickers. They are so hard to get off, and obsolete bumper stickers make me a little sad.&nbsp;Once in a great&nbsp;while I'll still see a "Gore/Liberman" sticker on someone's car. &nbsp;Sort of like Christmas lights up all year round. I've always wanted a "War Is Not The Answer" sticker.&nbsp; A nice, enduring, elegant statement.

       I finally heard back from the Icelandic group, GUK+.    urlLink  http://www.simnet.is/guk/index.htm   &nbsp; They want to do the planes, but need more info. I think the install probably won't be summer 2004. There is a pretty thorough explanation of the Dispensing With Formalities project on the site. Maybe too thorough.&nbsp; I still think it is a great idea, though. I love anything that messes with the "white cube" paradigm. So tired.     &nbsp;   I've been feeling kind of weird and "unreal" lately. Should I start putting those annoying little faces to indicate my mood? So much is on hold right now, but still so much is happening. I have a ton of projects that are all going so well, it kind of freaks me out a little. Just no job. Weird. I need to tighten things up some how. Make it all make some sense. I feel that if I keep doing projects that I care about , that somehow, someday, it will just start making sense. I don't know how to really explain this properly.

       I won a package of curry from a Japanese restaurant on Sunday. I don't remember the last time I won something. Maybe my luck is finally turning around.

       Blogger is new again. It seems more like a word processing program now. I like it.     &nbsp;   Kristi and Daniel had a party last night. It was good. Amy was supposed to come out early and we were going to go see some art first, but she got sick. Actually had to run off the phone to go throw up. Not nice.   &nbsp;   Last night someone said that Chuck Barry has a blog where he writes about smells. Sort of like a photo blog, but just smells. I have to try to find it. It is so weird.   &nbsp;   I started working at this transcription place with Kristi this week. It is OK. The manager kept warning me about how tedious it all was, but I don't really think that it is that bad. I'm used to that sort of computer induced tedium. And the people are nice. It will be OK until something more real comes along. I'm waiting with baited breath, as they say,&nbsp;for that&nbsp;art dealer job. &nbsp; It is just too perfect.     &nbsp;   Edith gave a link to my site to some wacky guy in San Francisco who makes quicksand pits on the street up there. Here is his link:  urlLink http://www.maybemagazine.com/quicksand1.html &nbsp; He gave me my third piece of fan mail.     I met a girl who does these really great benches made out of existing tree stumps. They just cut into them with a chainsaw to make a seat. Here:   urlLink  http://www.journalofaestheticsandprotest.org   &nbsp;It is under "art projects" and it is the "comfy city" project. The site is flash, so I can't put a direct link. I'm having fun putting in links now, BTW.    I'm going to a Needle Exchange meeting today. We are supposed to talk about proposals for new projects. I have nothing. I'm just too stressed about being unemployed to think about doing new stuff right now.      &nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;

      I went to an art show at the Standard last night with Chris and Bill. The show was kind of hard to get anything from. It was a show of phone camera photos. It was supposed to be all about how images have become social and with digital technology it is so easy for "anyone" to create images, blah, blah, blah. That sort of thing just doesn't come across in any real way visually using these tiny, crappy photos. Most of the problem was the display of the pictures. They were just too low res to hang on a wall. Some were being shown on computers as a slide show and they were much more successful.  I love the idea of the show, but the show itself was hard to look at. I feel like this way too often. Also, The Standard turns into the Pentagon on the weekends. It would actually be easier to get in the Pentagon than to the roof of the Standard. So silly. We drank in the lobby, which is ok.   We saw Mark on the Redline platform.  I need more paper to do some planes for Temporary Services. I'm just so broke. I sort of stiffed Bill and Chris last night. I hope they understand.   We talked about a lot of places that I want to go in the US last night. the Grand Canyon Carlsbad Caverns New Orleans  I would also like to go to Hawaii, Alaska, Washington DC, and Boston.

      I went to a presentation of Bob Fosse films at C-Level the other night. I like going to things there, because they are so casual. Maybe a little ad-hoc for some tastes, but a nice, comfortable space. I did learn a little about Fosse. I had never really looked at his non-dance films before. I really didn't know that they existed. I didn't know he directed "Lenny", for instance. Fosse did such interesting things with a camera. Very dance and theater influenced. It was nice to see the non-dance films juxtaposed against the big, well known dance numbers. They were really very similar.  I have always loved the darkness of Fosse, too. "Black, glittery, shiny poison." as the guy speaking said. I agree. I'm renting "All That Jazz". I haven't seen it in ages.  Bill bought one of my plane sets from Blissen.  Cut + Paste finally put up my cuffs. Blissen saw them. I feel a little bad, but I didn't know that they were going to be accepted.  I'm sending some planes to Temporary Services in Chicago for one of their street projects.

      I went out to Claremont for the 4th, which I haven't done in a very long time. I have never actually seen the parade. Even when I lived there. I heard that this year was really heavy on the Jesus. I think that is so weird. I have never thought that Claremont was very religious. I heard a hideous story about a flatbed truck with a crucified Jesus on it followed by army guys in camo. The banner read something like "THEY died for your freedom, HE died for your soul". I heard various reports about the actual verbiage on the banner, but it is all sick. Robin said it was like an episode of "King of the Hill". I always thought of Claremont as a relatively liberal place. Sort of Clinton democrat's. Educated, not much Jesus, but still pretty socially conservative. Just not jingoistic. Even a family just walking by me on their way to the parade all dressed up in sparkly red white and blue made me cringe. A few years ago I would have thought they were kind of lame, but still quaint and small-towney. Now it is just offensive.   The highlight of the party was Bill's ancient Gameboy equipped with a camera and a printer. I don't remember Gameboy ever having that option. I think Bill is probably the only one to ever buy one.  He took lots of photos which were very hard to read. "Is that me? No, that must be Mark." The little photos have Gameboy and Nintendo logos across the top and bottom.

      Have been really busy at work and tired in the evenings. I'm learning so much there. I still feel like I'm half faking it, but I know it will get better.  Went to the October Surprise BBQ/fundraiser on Sunday. Met Cara Baldwin, who was really great. Heard some really good music from Jim Brown Con Holloy. I guess they played recently with Rodney Graham. I never get out to see music anymore. I just don't think to check the listings.  I heard from Amy, and she is almost better. Still has awful headaches and is taking a lot of painkillers, though.  I'm reading "The Diary of Anne Frank". I have never read it. I don't know how it slipped past my high school reading list. It really is extraordinarily well written for a 13 year old. Therein lies the tragedy. She says a lot of thing about herself that almost lead me to believe that she may have been homosexual, or bi-sexual. In a very untested sort of way, given her age and situation. I wonder if there has ever been much fem/queer analysis written on it?

      I was really tired this week due to work. It is a good kind of tired though. I have blown off a few social things, which I don't want to get in the habit of doing.  The Sunscreen project is going to be exhibited as part of a show at ArtCenter next month. We have to finish it now. Edith is having Friday night cocktail/work parties at her house to get it done. I flaked. I feel bad.  The BBQ/fundraiser for October Surprise is tonight. I always get nervous about parties where I won't know very many people. I have to go though. I got an email from a woman named Cara Baldwin who is one of the organizers. She is sort of my "case worker" for the show. I guess the organizers have divided up all the proposals and are going to take on a few each, to provide any needed support. A nice idea. Cara really like my site, especially the planes. She said that had she known about them earlier, she would have published them in  urlLink The Journel of Aesthetics & Protest . I would have been excited. So, I have to meet her face to face tonight.  This morning I have to go get the locations for OS. Write down the address, and take photos. I really wish Amy could have taken part. It would have been fun to have a partner, and I think she would have met a lot of people who could possibly help her career. And nice people too! She should be getting her work published too.

       I have been working at my new job for a couple of days now. I like it. The people are really smart, and they care about what they do. It is so sad how rare that has become. At least in my recent experience. I think I'm going to be happy there.      Amy is still seriously ill. It's so scary. I called her house and her Mom said that she hasn't been out of bed or taken any calls since she got out of the hospital. Still totally sick. And the doctors don't know what yet. Weird.      Jimin left for Detroit on Monday. I will miss her, but I'm so happy that she found something before her visa ran out. Now Hae Won has to get something.       Hae Won took me out to dinner for my birthday on Friday. We went to this really great French restaurant in Eagle Rock. Some of the best food I've ever had.
