      All right, this is getting ridiculous! Now PayPal is having a class action lawsuit leveled against it!  If you are a Paypal member, you probably received an email telling you all about the class action. A quick summary of the reasons for the lawsuit might go like this:  Two Joe Shmoes figured out that there was a discosure regulation that Paypal wasn't following and  saw an opportunity to grab some money . Paypal was aware of the regulation, but didn't believe that it applied to businesses -- i.e. it applies to banks and other financial institutions, but Paypal isn't a bank as much as it is a service like Kazaa, only for money instead of files. The two slimeballs, em, err, plaintiffs I mean, filed their suits seperately but were later consolidated. Instead of going through a costly court battle, the parties went in for arbitration and settled on  $9.25 million being set aside  for people to be recompensed for all the harm they went through  because Paypal didn't disclose some obscure facts in the exact way that banks, loan companies, and insurance agencies do!!   Let's chalk up another victory for the forces of light! Vigilantly protecting the American public from something they aren't affected by or care about!  Come on, let's be serious!  How many of you have actually read through all the 15 pages of regulations  that Paypal already provides. Guess what! Now you can all ignore another 5 pages! I feel   SO   much safer now that I am ignoring all the disclosures instead of just some of them!!  Frankly, I'm a little bit relieved that the settlement was only $9.25 million! I'm afraid that it's all too common for the settlements to be much, much larger! And of course, as usual,  the lawyers are the ones who came out on top . From the $9.25 million, there will be around  $3.5 million used to pay for the lawyers . I knew I was in the wrong line of work!  Well, let's all take part of the great American pasttime and sue everyone in sight, and if we can't do that, let's at least get a piece of the pie!

      I got a new car yesterday! For all you poor yokels out there who have never driven a stick - get one!  I learned a stick on an old beat-up truck that was hardly thrilling to ride; and adventure maybe, but not thrilling. If I had known what fun it is to drive a manual, I think all my previous vehicles would have been stick too! I didn't even get a 'hotrod' of a car, just a small Kia! But since I wasted the first 8 years of my driving life on automatics, it's time to make up for lost time!

      Just saw  I Robot  today. I really enjoyed the movie; it is a very good action film that has more than just action to keep you interested.&nbsp; I read Asimov's book  I Robot  first and I think that really added a lot of depth to the movie.&nbsp; Will Smith may have overdone the 'bad boy' act a little bit in the beginning, but by the end he is fitting into his role&nbsp;perfectly.  The book's ending had the machines eventually coming to control earth through benign methods of being put more and more in charge until finally they end up running the world with the Three Laws fully in effect and a question mark as to how humanity would end up.  The entry into paradise for mankind, or the beginning of slavery?&nbsp;  The book gave a lot more to think about than the movie (as usual) but the movie did well by the book and didn't shunt aside the questions and ideas of the book.  All in all, a great movie - definitely among my favorites.&nbsp; Especially the robots using karate on each other! Most excellent!!

      Having very little talent in writing, I don't expect this to win any Pulitzers.&nbsp; Nominated, sure! But probably not winning.  While this will cover a broad gamut of topics, as you may guess from my Blog title, it will have a lot of karate in it. But that's because karate is such an excellent topic, and one should always write on what they know well.  To kick this off with a bang, here are a couple of pictures from the Summer 2004 Master Camp at Camp Green Lane. (near Philadelphia)&nbsp; Excellent times were had by all, and I met a lot of new friends as well as a bunch of the regulars buddies.&nbsp; These pictures were sent back to me from my friend, Yulia, from Israel.   urlLink A Sweaty Karate Camp!    urlLink The Four Musketeers ... or Karateka    urlLink Time to Celebrate    1) This is Yulia. She is a third dan, has a great Gankanku, was amazed by fireflies, and is a really great person. I love your accent! This was right after a really GREAT training.  2) Here is the rest of our little group from left to right: Jen, Dov, Yulia, and me. Jen won a couple of medals in the tournament earlier in the day including a second place in kumite in the adult women's black belt division.  3) To top off the evening and the camp, everyone went out to celebrate! Those headbands we're all wearing were gifts to everyone from the group that came over from Lebanon!  A great time and no injuries, much to my annoyance!

      Everyone is home, safe and sound! They thoroughly enjoyed themselves out there with Norm, Pauline, Grandma, Shar, and the dogs. Katie came back with some clothes that she got while they were touring parts of Hollywood with Shar. She went to Hard Rock Cafe, Hollywood and got a cool hat, saw a ton of movie memorabilia, and got some fun pictures.  Now they are shifting back to Eastern Standard Timezone, and repairing all the damage that we three males visited upon the house during their absence! WELCOME HOME!!!  Actually, for the most part we did well - we had Margaret here to keep us in line a bit.  ;^)

      Well, yesterday I went to a family reunion; my dad's side of the family. My mom's side is all over the country, but my dad's is centered in western Pennsylvania, so our yearly family reunion is attended by far more people than I can keep track of. I missed the traditional golf game that morning as I was a church, but apparently the time was as full of laughs as it was bogies. Actually, while from all reports a hilarious time was had by all, they did quite well - most of them hit par over nine holes. That is WAY out of my league as I'm lucky to hit the ball when I swing, much less hit it in the direction that I would like.  Maybe next year I'll make it to the gold game.  I'll ask them to stick me on my own team and I'll consider it a victory if my score is less than their cumulative team score.  You are also reading the blog of the Grossman/McConnell family champion pie eater! Yes, that's right I downed a blueberry Hostess pie in record time! Mainly I was the fastest only because my dad had to leave a bit early. I inherited a great set of genes there!  We had a talent show (I won a first place ribbon) and I played softball with a lot of the younger kids: pitched, fielded, pretended to drop balls, and happened to trip whenever I was about to tag one of the little kids, while they all batted, ran, stole, and generally had a time of organized chaos. It was a Blast!!! We also had absolutely gorgeous weather - mid seventies and mostly sunny.  Tomorrow, mom and Katie are getting home from California, so I'm doing a quick cleanup. Playtime is over!

      Shotokan karate tends to eschew weapons as a core part of the style. To my knowledge there isn't any official weapons training in the JKA organization despite their emphasis on tradition. Part of it is probably just because most people don't train in karate hard enough to be able to afford to branch off into weapons much. With dozens of weapons, some of them being a style in and of themselves (Kendo), unless you are training seriously almost every day in karate, weapons will probably be an interesting diversion - at least in our style. It's along the thought of "jack of all trades, master of none.  But there is so much you can learn while doing weapons!! We worked on nunchakus tonight. You know, those two sticks connected by a rope that you spin around. Michelangelo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles uses them. :-) While working with them, I think I was able to develop my hip/arm coordination some and the strikes help your focus a lot!  If you've ever seen someone fight in a movie with nunchuks, they aren't doing it for real (duh!) because if they were, the first semi-decent hit from a nunchuk will flatten a person. Crushed bones, destroyed muscles, and snapped tendons are the result of even a decent hit -- far more than the bloody cheek or bruised arm! But don't worry, if you ever go up against someone who has a pair of nunchuks and he is spinning them around in all sorts of fancy ways, he either doesn't know how to  practically  use them or he's phenomenally good with them and you're as good as dead.  Now, isn't that a comforting thought to end on!

      Ok, ok. Lousy pun. Maybe there will be some LOTR nut out there who gets it.  Where I went 'There and Back Again' was Virginia for my son's second birthday. A quick explanation: he is absolutely nuts about fire engines and firemen. (and close behind comes any sort of motorized vehicle) So, we went to a fire station and got a tour! While he's not shy, he's not especially outgoing either, so imagine my surprise and amusement when the fireman who gave the tour came up to our group and Jeremiah goes directly over to him and wants to be picked up! By a stranger! All because of the fireman's uniform.  He loved the tour and we even were given the treat of having a call come in and watching the firemen jump into the truck and take off with lights and sirens wailing!  Needless to say, most of his presents were fire truck oriented!  After the party, Katie and I went to a terrific play,  Guys and Dolls , with  urlLink Charlessa  and Joanna. A great production, by an excellent cast and crew. They kept it moving along very nicely, and while it probably trimmed out some of the finer nuances, I didn't notice, and it kept the audience engrossed for the play's entirety.  Now, Katie and Mom left for Arizona and California for visiting relatives and so it's just David, Dad, Margaret, and myself. While the mom's away, the house will play!

      For anyone out there who wants to lose weight, I have a terrific solution: come join my karate club! Especially during these hot, muggy summer days, we have an unbelievable workout. I have no doubts that I sweat off at least a quart of water. I stock up before I go to class, and we take lots of water breaks, but it's still a really heavily soaked gi that I pulled off tonight.  I'm not the worst either! Poor Dino (he's Italian) swallows half a gallon of water during class and is still losing water overall! His heavyweight gi can be wrung out like a washcloth. :^P  It's great exercise too, not just sweat. We covered Jion and Heian Godan for the class, and then after class was over, Sensei and I worked on Kanku Dai and Unsu. Anyone who takes Shotokan style karate, or a derivative thereof will understand my gibberish there. :^D  We've got the JKA Fall Camp coming up the second weekend of September, and there are five brown belts in our class that have never gone, that hopefully we will get to come along. Four of them are on track to test for black belt in a year and a half, so we'll be dragging them to this camp, or the next.  Ahhh, Fall Camp — cold mornings, an even colder gi, great training, lousy food, outdoor training, smelly cabins, a tournament and lots of friends.    YEEEHHAAAAAAWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!
