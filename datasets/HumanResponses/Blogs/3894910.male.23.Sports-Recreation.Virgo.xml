      Who loved the group "Body Count" with Ice T? You can admit it. That group was tight.   Alright, now who is glad that Shaq left the Lakers? I hate the Lakers, so him leaving was great news b/c now the T-Wolves can take the West next season.   I am thinking of going to Australia to kick it with my sis and her husband. I wouldn't have to pay for much, except the ticket. I'm not doing anything here except writing on this blog, so I might as well. But leaving my girl for another few months would suck. I should just flip a coin.   Please pipe in with your suggestions...

      What is going on? Still haven't found a job. Probably haven't been working as hard as I could, which my girlfriend pointed out to me the other day. I wasn't in the mood to hear it, so I got pretty pissed. It was uncalled for.  Due to my bro's advice, I decided to look into a job being a bar-back at some place. I guess I would just be re-filling bottles and bringing in new kegs etc. Sounds good, but it would be something I just did for the money and possibly the atmosphere, depending on the place.   Anyone have any good job ideas? I'm all freakin' ears.   Alright, I gotta run, but I'll post a little sumthin sumthin later...

      Okay, so now I think I have one person that knows about this Blog besides my girlfriend. Welcome, Ted!  Alright, I promised a film review, but instead I am going to list my favorite movie characters of all time in no particular order:  Michael McManus--From the Usual Suspects. This guy is great. Who else can make "fuck you, you cocksucker motherfucker..ahahahahahahah" sound so damn funny?  Fred Fenster--Also from the Usual Suspects. This guy says "fuck you, ya cocksucker" in this weird, indiscernible dialect, and then the cop immediately says, "in English!" Absolutely hilarious. Too bad this guy gets wacked by Kobayashi.  The Dude--From The Big Lebowski. The man, who likes his caucasions, knows what ties a room together. Enough said.  Ice Man--From Top Gun. His little dialogue with Maverick in the locker room when he tells him that he's dangerous and unsafe is classic.  Jeff Spicoli--Fromm Fast Times at Ridgemont High--It would be great to order some 'za in a classroom.   David Wooderson--Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused. This dude, in his late 20s with the greatest porn 'stache I've ever seen, proclaims his love for high school girls with one of the best lines ever. "Do you know why I love high school girls?" he asks his friends. The answer: "Because I keep getting older and they stay the same age."  There are many more. Please share some of your all-time favorites.

      Okay, this dude's head has been on the chopping block for so long it's almost ridiculous. I can't decide whether NBA beat writers and columnists don't have any hot new rumors to write about so they just fabricate some BS about Wally for some odd reason, or if Kevin McHale and Flip Saunders are lying through their teeth every time they say that Wally is staying in Minnesota.  My gut feeling is that it's a bunch of BS and Wally is staying. If the Wolves should do anything, they should try to do some type of sign-and-trade deal with the Warriors so that they can get Dampier and rid themselves of Olowokandi's sorry ass.  If we can re-sign Hassell and Hudson and acquire Dampier, I think we got the West on lockdown. If anyone even mentions the Spurs (shut up Reyes), I'll permanently ban them from the site. Brent Barry is only slightly better than Turkoglu and any team that has Kevin Willis playing major minutes is in serious trouble in my humble opinion.   It'll be interesting to see who finishes where in the West among the following teams: the Kings, Grizzlies, Mavs, Rockets, Jazz, and Nuggets (if they get KMArt).   And what's this I hear? Divac's Academy-Award wannabe ass is thinking of retiring. I like the sounds of that. I kind of liked him for a while, when he was doing everyone in with his patented dipsy-do shit, but his time has come and gone. The Kings will probably be better off without him. So long to the bearded man with huge lips.  Okay, here are three of the top 10 players that I can't stand in the NBA--more to come later:  1) Kirk Hinrich (okay, please tell me how he made it in the L and Ryan Robertson didn't. Same player, just a few years difference. I'll recognize that Hinrich played well this season at times, but it was the Bulls and nobody cared.)  2) Kobe Bryant (I believe a man from White Men Can't Jump once said, "You'd rather look good and lose, then look bad and win." Plus, he's been getting all kinds of love with Shaq around, let's see what he does without Daddy)  3) Olowokandi (soft, like Erick Patterson soft--but at least Patterson had a stroke and a mean streak every once in a while)

      Woke up this morning to the buzzing of a lawn mower--it was fantastic. I was hoping to sleep a few more hours before I woke up to the realization that I don't have a job for yet another day. Too bad, maybe tomorrow.  I am actually not too depressed about my job situation. I mean, this is oddly therapeutic--writing about not having a job. I almost feel like it is a job, just without pay. Weird, huh? What I'm doing now is actually not too different than having an internship. Some people would substitute a measly income for not having people patronize you and tell you to put together clip packages all day.   Anyways, just called about the job I interviewed for and the dude I talked to is on vacation for a week. The lady I spoke with told me to call back next Tuesday, which will be July 20. Yeah, about that. Can anyone say, "The writing is on the wall?" The guy told me that he had to fill the position by the end of June when I interviewed, yet I won't get a decision until 10 days before training camp begins. You gotta love the suspense of waiting for three weeks...at least I do. I mean, who wouldn't want to hold their dick in their hand for three weeks while they leech off of their girlfriend and watch their money dwindle away on booze and food?  I actually have been doing some productive things...shaving occasionally, showering 5-6 days a week, working out, looking for other jobs, e-mailing people, reading. It's great!  Alright ya'll, keep hope alive and I'll do the same.

      What's up everyone? This is my first post. I'd like to thank Chris Huston for giving me this idea. Enjoy!   Before I write any commentary, I'd like to throw out all of my biases on the table. The following are my favorite sports teams/schools:  USC sports (especially football) Minnesota Timberwolves Minnesota Vikings Minnesota Twins Chicago Cubs  And these are the teams/schools that I can't stand:  Lakers Yankees Red Sox White Sox Packers Cowboys UCLA Texas A&M   That being said, whatever I put on this site will be as objective as possible. Please feel free to disagree with me as much as you want. That's what will make the site interesting.   Thanks for checking in and spread the word (http://sportstalkonline.blogspot.com)
