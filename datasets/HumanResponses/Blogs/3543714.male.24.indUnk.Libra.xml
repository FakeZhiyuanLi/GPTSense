						   Great! things to read this summer so we won't ever get bored, eh? Hehe.. but, but I have to say, I'm looking forward to this. Finally doing a real project sort of thing. Anyway, got an email today with a recent article we're supposed to read. Of course you got the mail too, but I'm posting the link anyway.. for reference. http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0406024.

						   I've got a list of things to read while enjoying the summer: 1) Book in QED: E.A. Power "Inroductory Quantum Electrodynamics", 1964     (I've borrowed this one from Iver himself!) 2) Physical Reports (PR): 134, 87-193 (1968): Plunien, Müller, Greiner "The casimir     effect"  3) Book in field theory: K.A. Milton, "The Casimir effect", 2001 (This one is hard to     read,and we're not gonna read this!) 4) PR: 354, 1-205 (2001): Bordag, Mohideen, Mostepanenko: "New developements n the     Casimir Effect" 5) Physical Rev. Letter 91, 050402 (2003): Decca, Lopez,....   6) Physical Rev. Letter E 66, 026119    ---------"------------ 63, 051101    ---------"------------ 67, 056116    All written by Aarseth, Høye and Brevik  7) Brevik, Aarseth, Høye, Milton: http://arxiv.org  (quant-ph/0311094)  8) Physical Rev. 88, 041804  9) http://arxiv.org/quant-ph/abs/0312043v1 (2003)  And now our project:       Find the Casimir effect for a plate and a sphere for different sorts of materials:        Cu, Au, Al  I'm gonna read 1), 2) and possibly som of the Physical Review letters. Iver told me that's the most important one. Enjoy! Call me if you have trouble finding them on the net.

						   Alright, we obviously need to use some math on these pages, so let's find out if we can use MathML to display our equations.                                       a            +            b                        2             Crap, this obviously didn't work.. Looking for alternatives. What a sorry state the world is in...

						   Quantum Field Theory predicts that vacuum holds energy due to fluctuations in the fields. In a cavity, i.e. two mirrors placed close to each other, only fields with wavelengths corresponding to an integer multiple of the distance between the mirrors can exist. This reduces the energy density in the cavity compared to that on the outside, resulting in an attractive force between the mirrors.

						   Interesting starting point: http://physicsweb.org/article/world/15/9/6 Looking at casimir effect inside a hollow sphere might prove interesting, but possibly lack of qualifications to do. Reserve for later consideration

						   After reading "The Casimir Effect" by Pluninen,.... I think that the Casimir effect can be shortly explained as: 'A measurable change in ground state energy because of change in the boundary conditions. This gives rise to a force, which often is named the retarded van der Waals force.  I think that if the energy of the universe is constant, the loss / gain in the Casimir energy is nothing else than the corresponding gain / loss of potential energy between the boundaries (f. ex. parallell walls in a box, or extern electromagnetid field). This change in potential energy gives rise to a force ( F= - dV/d x )  which is the retarded var der Waals force.  Comments?!

						   I think that sounds reasonable. I haven't read that article yet, but from what I understand your description is fairly accurate. The whole point, or at least, a big chunk of it, is the boundary conditions you impose. Parallel plates, plate and a sphere, whatever. The fact that the force changes sign when a sphere is involved is worth noting and adds to the importance of these conditions.
