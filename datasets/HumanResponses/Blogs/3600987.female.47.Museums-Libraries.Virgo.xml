      I just saw you can do audioblogs and team blogs! Plus you can quickly comment on what you read now--to make it even easier to dialogue together.  So, Scanbloggers, I'm picking back up about  customer service .   iTunes  I heard today, from my self-confessed  urlLink iTunes -junkie friend, (he bought 20 songs last night) that Apple has started to provide additional value-added information on your e-receipt for iTunes.  That's right--not just while you're shopping--but now once you've purchased, you can also see the Amazon-like "people who've bought this song have also enjoyed X." Pretty cool--they've seen to it that I find each step of my customer experience valuable in and of itself...even  after  I've given them my $0.99.   It's good for me, the customer, because I am curious to know what other extremely fun people like me listen to.   It's great for Apple, because they're taking you straight back in for another purchase you didn't know you needed. But once it presents itself--well, you  have  to have it.  We'll have to invent the word for a  music-buying-binge . Tweeners, what is it?  Keep scanning-- Alice

      Starting a new blog to have an official/unofficial discussion forum for the aftermath of the  Scan .  (For the uninitiated, the Scan refers to the   urlLink 2003 OCLC Environmental Scan: Pattern Recognition  , in which OCLC cast a wide net to find out what people were doing in the information sphere, so to speak. We looked at the way information needs create virtual communities, emerging technology/software and why libraries are so under the gun now to demonstrate their economic necessity and ROI within their respective communities.)  I learned today that you can buy the Scan on  Amazon . I was amazed--I guess Amazon doesn't need to ask you if you want your book to be sold through their Web store--it's just assumed you do? (Not that I'm complaining...)  urlLink See for yourself >>   I wonder if we've gotten orders for it already, through Amazon? It looks like an enriched record in there. Hey Amazon catalogers, have you read our stuff?  The Scan has shaken up a lot of people, because we tried to put the facts on paper, capturing the now--but of course it immediately prompts the "Okay, so now what?"   Scan reactions  I hear today that our own Cathy De Rosa has presented about the Scan to more than 800 people, personally! And she says that those 800 people in turn, talk to 5 more people, who talk to 5 more people. And the ripple effect grows.  How has it affected you?   For me, at the ripe old age of 29, (yikes!) it meant I realized I was OLD in techno-terms. Sure, I knew what IM, XSLT, RSS and a host of additional acronymns could do *in theory,* but I hadn't actually played with them. I'd ignored the text-messaging capability on my mobile phone--and shut off my IM so I could "get some work done." Well guess what? I had become an information philistine, in front of my very eyes. So I'm actively playing with all the gadgets possible now, to make up for lost time.   Customer Service  The other thread that's surfaced today, for me, is the importance of customer service in our "Me: Now" world. The Scan touches on it, a bit. Is it just me, a gen-Xer? Or is it everyone?  I am so impatient now-and I value experiences almost above all else. For example, I was waiting in the doctor's office and felt compelled to send text messages while I waited...and my message content consisted of moaning about how I was being kept waiting! It's a whole lot of yakking about nothing, yet I kept doing it...  I took time off to visit the bastion of medical knowledge, the doctor's office--even though I had self-diagnosed on  urlLink WebMD . Sure, I walked out with a perscription, but I felt like my 45 minute visit was largely wasted time. Why couldn't we have had the interaction by e-mail or chat?  Here's the kicker:  How many library customers feel exactly the same way?  Sure, they got what they came for, but it left a bad taste in their mouth--because there was no packaging of the customer experience. Let's think tomorrow about ways we can address that in our libraries.  Enough for today. See you tomorrow, Scanbloggers. Alice   Truth in lending  This content is not endorsed by OCLC.

       urlLink BLOGBRARIES - Push Button Publishing for Libraries and Librarians   I spotted this on the web site of the  urlLink School of Library, Archival and Information Studies  at the University of British Columbia (where my library degree is from)and thought it looked like a nice, short overview of blogging for librarians. If you read it, you'll note that the student who created this would put Alice, George and I are in the "slacker blogger" category because we're using plain vanilla Blogger for our blog. A true fact, I'm afraid, as we're learning to blog--and doing our day jobs as well! Here's some more links to thoughts and help on beginning blogs, from the  urlLink University of Winnipeg ; from a guy at Hewlett-Packard writing about the  urlLink semantic web and blogging ; from an  urlLink SLA division ; from  urlLink MSDN ; and an article on using  urlLink blogging for reference service . There's lots of help and information on the web--I used "learning to blog" as a search term--now, if only I had time to read it all and become a better blogger!

      The coolest thing about today's OCLC luncheon at the ALA conference (at least within the context of this blog) was when the audience broke into spontaneous applause after Jay Jordan mentioned that the Scan's authors had been awarded a special citation from the president of ALCTS, Brian Schottlaender, for its contributions to the field.   Thanks, President Scottlaender!

      Yesterday (Saturday) at the ALA Conference, I had a chance to talk with the  urlLink Urban Libraries Council 's (ULC) Forecasting Study Group about the future of libraries generally, and urban public libraries specifically. There are about a dozen people on the Study Group, and several other library directors showed up for the discussion.  urlLink Joey Rodger , the  urlLink soon to depart President of ULC , also participated in the discussion.  During the first hour of the conversation, I never mentioned the Scan. The Study Group had been involved in making recommendations to the ULC Board about how to think about the future in their environment.  urlLink Andrew Blau  had led a discussion with the ULC Board about  urlLink scenario planning in the Global Business Network  model.  The goal of scenario planning is not predict the future. Instead, the idea is to construct alternative views that are outside of your natural inclinations and ideas. What might the world be like if this trend continues, or if the  current realities play out logically? What do the demographics tell us about the future? It has often been said that science fiction is never really about the future, it's about the present. In the same vein, scenario planning isn't about knowing the future, it's about understanding the present. Good scenario planning lets you see what's happening now a little differently.  Good scenario planning is also remarkably labor and cost intensive. So the ULC Board has been struggling with ways to create a futures-based planning process that can be broadly useful without breaking the bank.  A big part of the discussion before we talked about the Scan was centered on what the role of the public library would be in an age of information plentitude rather than information scarcity. Much discussion ensued about the role of the library in building community. The remarkable Herb Elish, director of the  urlLink Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh , talked about how public libraries make social engineering decision every time they decide where to place a branch library. Do you place the branch in the center of a culturally siloed (by nationality, race, income) community, or do you place it on the borders between different communities, to encourage people who might never meet otherwise to interact in this space?   Next, the directors talked about library staffs and what's happening on that front. Several noted that they have hired Generation X and Generation Y librarians, with resulting generational and culture clashes between these generations and the Boomers (in the interest of full disclosure, I'm a Boomer, due to turn 49 next week). One director related a story about a leadership program that she had been involved with in her home state. Those two masters of library leadership,  urlLink John Shannon and Becky Schreiber , were leading a discussion about the changes in how people seek information. They related their own experiences in using libraries less as they seek answers on Google. The participants in the program, librarians who are expected to be the leaders of our profession in years to come, mostly people in their 30's and very early 40's, tried to tell John and Becky that they weren't   really   finding what they needed. Forcefully but diplomatically, Becky and John tried to convince these folks that, yes, indeed, they are finding what they need, thank you very much. The new leaders simply can't face the reality that traditional reference services are being eclipsed by Google and Yahoo.  Ginnie Cooper, director at  urlLink Brooklyn Public Library  and chair of the committee, talked about how most of the top companies in the US at the turn of the 20th century no longer existed at the turn of the 21st. The few that are still around have drastically changed their businesses. She specifically noted that  urlLink GE  made and sold light bulbs in 1900; today they still sell bulbs, but now, they outsource the manufacture and just put them in GE-branded boxes. Instead, GE makes its money on finance and medical imaging technologies, business models that didn't even exist in 1900. This made me think that the library of the future may have automated and hidden their finding services so completely and so effectively that the public face of the service will be utterly different.  Joey suggested that ULC might consider encouraging a skunkworks, maybe five libraries that would implement off-the-wall ideas as a testbed for new ideas. Herb said that this was a great idea, but in order for it to work, the libraries would need to bring in people from outside the profession as a reality check, to challenge preconceptions and prejudices. I reminded them of the old saw, "We don't know who discovered water, but we know it wasn't a fish."  After an hour of stimulating discussion and a 20-minute break full of lots of smaller, equally intriguing conversations, I gave an overview of the Scan, focusing on the landscapes, the dominant trends (decrease in guided access to content, disaggregation, and collaboration and context), and the three themes (self-sufficiency, satisfaction, and seamlessness). I hit a couple of the major factors as they apply to public libraries: the "third place," the changes in the profession, the  urlLink collections grid  (Lorcan and  urlLink Eric Childress  would disavow the grid if they knew how quickly and shallowly I covered their brilliant concepts), and I wrapped up by saying that if we never ask the unaskable, if we refuse to think the unthinkable, we will never reach beyond our current reality. And the current reality will not hold.  Herb noted that we can't be a successful third place if all we offer is the sort of dry materials that frequently characterize the lower right hand quarter of the grid (sorry, Lorcan and Eric---it was my interpretation, not your ideas!) This kicked off a discussion of how important well-curated special collections are to furthering the mission of the public library. Several directors noted that the best exploitations of the special collection were being done by people who came from a museum or public relations background.  Joey and Herb stressed that a true leader needs to create a compelling vision of where she is leading people, rather than giving them reasons simply to tear away from the old stuff. Joey noted, in a phrase I am sure to steal in the future,  urlLink Moses  was able to get the Hebrews to follow him for forty years in the desert because he provided a  vision of a Promised Land before them, he didn't reinforce the memory of Egypt behind them.  The next part of the fast-moving discussion centered on the changing roles of reference in the public library. One director noted that Adult Service in general is not adopting to the new world as effectively as Children's Service has. Reference librarians still consider themselves the "priestly class" in libraries, even if that opinion does not permeate the whole institution.  Barbara Gubbin, the director of the  urlLink Houston Public Library  and a member of the OCLC Board asked about the role of public libraries in the new wave of worldwide immigration. She and Dr. Wai-Fong Lee, a trustee of the  urlLink King County (Washington) Library  and a board member of ULC, noted that this is not a US phenomenon; as Eastern Europe has opened up and tried to integrate more with the EU, there are millions of people immigrating across that continent. There are Asians and Africans on the move within and outside their continents. Joey noted that Gary Strong (late of  urlLink Queens Borough Public Library  and now the dean of libraries at  urlLink UCLA ) said years ago that "Community information is now your locality and the country you came from." Through e-mail, online newspapers and radio broadcasts, and relatively inexpensive air fares, the isolation of the immigrant is a thing of the past, and many immigrants live with one foot in their current home and one in the home of the birth (or their parents' birth).  Patrick Losinski of the  urlLink Columbus Metropolitan Library  asked about the passage in the Scan that notes that there have not been demonstrable improvements in library productivity that are attributable to increased automation. I noted that it has only been in the last couple of years that the economy as a whole has been able to measure the productivity impact of automation in non-manufacturing industries. I offered the opinion (and that's ALL it is) that library operations have always been resistant to numerical assessment. It is possible to compare how many hours it took to build a  urlLink Chevrolet Impala in 1958 , and how many hours it takes to build a 2004 Impala, and to see how productivity has changed in those years. There is little baseline information to compare in libraries, especially in public services.  Finally, we talked about what "seamlessness" means in the context of the Scan. I talked about how I see this as being willing to let go of our traditional desire to get the customer in the door (whether that door is physical or virtual) and presenting our services where our putative clients are, allowing them to get to those services directly. I said that we might want to consider spending less time building library web sites and more time building connectivity with the web sites to which those clients already go.  I closed by suggesting that we need to change our dialogue in the profession. I said that we need to have a public debate with a "resolved" that might read, "RESOLVED, that libraries need to get out of the cataloging and reference business and move into the information and community businesses." I said that perhaps our cataloging services need to move from the front, the gateway between the user and the material, to the back, as the invisible guide to the information that user needs. Reference perhaps will be about collecting and organizing information in the background to ensure that within the proper context the user will find exactly what she wants without any apparent external intervention. Community building will be using our resources to create and support communities of interest, be they vocational, ethnic, national, political, or personal interest. The session effectively ended when someone asked me, " urlLink Does OCLC know you're talking like this ?"

      This section details some of the discussion that followed the break at the OCLC Symposium today. Well, actually it was yesterday, since I'm writing this after midnight.  When I went to conference in years past, if I was up at this hour it was because I was drinking and partying with friends. Now I'm blogging, and I wonder if this is an improvement. It's not even cheaper, since I'm paying $13 a day for high speed internet access in my hotel room, and that would buy me at least half a bottle of decent (if not single malt) Scotch.   For ease of reading, I've put similar questions and discussion together to smooth out the flow.  Anyway, after the break, Cathy De Rosa kicked off the Q & A session with a question to Cindy Cunningham, asking her to amplify her comments about what could unify the library profession. Cindy said that the idea of opening up and sharing our resources in a broader way is one basis of unity, and she pointed to the relationship between  urlLink OCLC and Google  (and Yahoo, although there aren't any good links about this one yet) as an example. She also cited the Library of Congress's new  urlLink web-based cataloging records . She also reiterated that the search engines are in a desperate race for content, and guess who has the content?  Cathy asked Dan Chudnov why we should think of reference as an infosphere rather than as a transaction. Dan said that the reference interview is a powerful concept and not to be discounted. But the way librarians understand how a user is satisfied is incomplete. (For those who are interested in this concept, the Ohio State University and OCLC are embarked on a  urlLink study  of this.)  Someone from the audience asked the $64,000 question: Will cataloging be needed in the future? Cindy said that she had instructed the catalogers at Amazon not to catalog an item for what it is right now but for how it might be used in the future. The important thing is to try to understand how people will want to use the information in the cataloging record. And much of that information is very important. For example, she noted that people want to know about the binding type, whether a book has photos or illustrations or an index, how many pages it contains. In other words, some sort of description of the item will continue to be needed.   But an audience member noted that we are dealing with a whole generation of people who have never seen a card catalog, but who are expected to use our local systems that are built around this concept. This is not the way people search any more.   Cindy noted that the structure of how a catalog record works is the secret of the library profession. She described how book sellers had attempted to come up with a simple way of identifying materials for ease of finding on the shelf. When online booksellers came in they ended up adding additional subject fields until the record ended up more complicated than a MARC record. She said cataloging is complex because the   world   is complex. Perhaps there are ways we can map this information in new ways to make it more meaningful to those who seek simplicity, or develop systems where we seek more information from the user to help narrow down the search. Dan asked Cindy how we can improve search without losing serendipity (the more targeted the results, the less chance there is to find something related but not directly requested). Cindy conceded this was a possibility, but that many of the search engines could also provide the side trips by making suggestions about related topics.  Dan noted that we have crossed a line in the last few years, as more and more current material is available online and users find less need for the paper materials. The key for the library future is figuring out what value we add to the organization and retrieval of what the individual needs, while creating an organizational structure for that information that is open and accessible to all information providers so they can offer their materials.  Another audience member noted a sentence from the Scan that says that digitization is for access and not for preservation. If this is so, how does the librarian know what is worth preserving? Dan referred again to the  urlLink OAIS Reference Model  as a beginning of understanding in this area. He said this process led to such standard tools as  urlLink DSpace  and  urlLink Fedora . And Cindy noted that librarians and archivists have proven over the years that they actually are pretty good at knowing what to keep. Cindy also noted that we keep moving collections from format to format, and that maybe we need to apply our skills in collaboration to the question of distributing responsibility for which institution will preserve what. Cindy brought up the case of  urlLink Brewster Kahle  and the  urlLink Internet Archive , which is attempting to preserve a record of the web. Cindy noted that this information is too important to lose but too expensive to save.   The final question was "What are we as a profession willing to give up in order to be relevant in the new infosphere?"  There was a long pause. Dan finally said, "No one has trusted me with this one yet." Despite his techie credentials, he noted that "Print's a great technology. We've grown up with it, we understand it." He remembered a time when he worked at an institution, which, he noted ruefully, "was still learning how to keep a network operating consistently." He said that he had proposed actually printing out and saving everything that they were getting from  urlLink JSTOR , simply because print is totally reliable. Cindy said that she wanted to challenge the profession to think about the unthinkable, to consider such forbidden topics as fees for service, or changing the mission from being an intellectual organization to being a social one. She said she was not endorsing these ideas, but they and many others need to be considered as we try to build the future.  Cathy wrapped up the program with thanks to the speakers and to the audience for making it so successful. She asked the attendees to continue the discussion in their own institutions and---gasp!---in this blog. Yes, she gave the URL right out in public! So start adding comments and we will be delighted to keep this discussion going!

      Cindy Cunningham was the third speaker in the Symposium, after Cathy De Rosa's opening comments and brief overview of the Scan, and Dan Chudnov's comments on freedom and collaboration.   Cindy has been a very popular speaker in the library field over the years for several reasons. She's been at the heart of some of the most interesting projects in the infosphere, including being the metadata maven for Amazon for six years, and she is a terrific storyteller. Today she talked about the state of "search" in the minds of some of the big search engines. She talked about how companies like Amazon and Google have developed search strategies that are based on using past searches as the basis for predicting what future searchers will want, and by seeking similarities that use context to help determine what the searcher is really after.  She noted that the point of the new search engines is to make finding the information you need as simple as possible. You had to know something about the subject you were pursuing to use the bricks-and-mortar library, but search engines have removed this as a barrier. You can start from any keyword, and in many cases, even if you spell the keyword wrong, you'll get a running start. The search engines do this by impinging just a little on each user's privacy, and for the most part, the users don't mind. They appreciate the convenience, and aren't concerned that their search information is being amalgamated into the larger engine to refine searches for themselves and future users.  Cindy said that libraries have always appealed to diverse audiences with diverse collections, and the more we as librarians knew about our users, the better able we are to serve them. (Parenthetically, as a former reference librarian myself, I always felt this was why a face-to-face reference transaction was usually more successful that one over the phone. I could tell the approximate age of the person, I could tell by his or her body language if what I was saying made sense or if I was headed out to La-La Land, and if the person generally seemed pleased with what was being delivered. None of these cues came over the phone.) Search engines are trying to reproduce this "learning behavior," and they are even trying to build in some of the serendipity experience of browsing the stacks in a well-stocked library. ("If you like this information, maybe you'll like...)  The "search" business is changing constantly. Yahoo has just purchased an Indian search engine company. Amazon has spun off its home grown search capability into a  urlLink separate company . All the companies in this space are striving to line up content.   The next step will be moving from trying to identify what the user wants to trying to deliver what the search engine  wants  the individual to want. She pointed up several examples from the commercial world where, all other things being equal, the engine will direct the user to the product which provides the engine with the best financial return. This seemed to surprise some in the audience, although, upon reflection, it's not hard to understand. (Another parenthetical note: When I shop at a supermarket, I know that the end displays aren't there because these are the best values. They are there because the supermarket manager has made a deal with the wholesaler or the producer to put them there. Sometimes these products are what I want, sometimes they aren't. In this way, the web store is no different from the bricks and mortar store. If I want unbiased information, I'll pull out my copy of    urlLink Consumer Reports .  ) Cindy mentioned that one of the projects that the search engines are working on is being able to reconcile data from multiple sources to develop the most reliable information possible.   Cindy noted that the physical and virtual worlds are becoming more and more interrelated, and making the bridge between the two is also an ongoing area of concern. One forms a mental map of a virtual space, such as a library layout, and then must translate it to the physical world. This is a cognitive leap that has to be accommodated for users.  Finally, Cindy talked about how, in the first wave of technology, we tried to simply automate all the old library functions, without really thinking about how or if they should be automated, or if there might be a better way to do the services in the first place. For the most part, we've gotten over that.  Then we tried to imitate everything that the dot-com world was trying to do. We're still in that wave in a lot of ways, but we're getting a little better.  Now, as a profession we're starting to move into the sphere of realizing that there are certain things we do well, and that we should be capitalizing on those things to leverage and ensure our future. The knowledge and experience that the library profession have developed and honed over the years will be more valuable as information becomes even more pervasive.   She closed her remarks by quoting something she had heard  urlLink Bill Clinton  say at BookExpo in Chicago a few weeks ago. He'd said that he was optimistic for the United States despite the extreme polarization abroad in the land. He noted that at nearly every point in US history when the country has become severely polarized, it has chosen unity and international involvement as a way out. After the Revolution, after the Civil War, after the Great Depression and World War II, after Vietnam, we sought to unify and look outward. The sole exception was after World War I, and this had dire consequences.  Cindy noted that she thinks the library field will choose unity as well as we collaborate and cooperate to improve our profession.  In my final post on the symposium, to be done later tonight, I'll tell you about the discussion that closed the session. Good stuff there, too!

      I hope you were at the OCLC Symposium at the ALA Conference today (June 25). If not, I hope you'll check out the tape when it gets up on our web site. Two of the brightest lights in our field, Cindy Cunningham (Director of Cataloging for  urlLink Corbis ) and  urlLink Dan Chudnov  a programmer and librarian at the Yale Center for Medical Informatics, used the Scan as a launching pad for speculating about the future of the library profession. Their remarks were a thoroughly refreshing way to start the conference.  Cathy De Rosa, the OCLC VP for Marketing and Library Services, set up the program by posing two questions: How do we satisfy today's information consumer, who is fairly indifferent to traditional library services? And how do we satisfy today's information consumer, who has a nearly insatiable appetite for our information resources, but who wants to control their use? She gave a quick overview of the Scan and updated some of the information it contained, introducing the executive summary. Copies of the summary were available for attendees and will be available from OCLC shortly.  Dan Chudnov began his remarks by calling the E-Scan an "electric document." He said it "gives me a lot of hope that our profession is thinking about the right things." He used two themes for his comments: freedom and collaboration.   He talked about freedom in the context of the  urlLink Open Source Software  movement, which he described as "a philosophy of freedom first, and a business and engineering model second." Dan placed this concept into the context of the Scan by discussing the collaborative nature of open source. He talked about how OSS looks at and analyzes problems, about how it works in conjunction with and in opposition or reaction to proprietary software, and how it overcomes the fear of business failure. (Even if the original developers of an  urlLink open source piece of software drop it , the source code is out there for anyone to work with, develop, and perhaps revive.  Dan then described " urlLink Hackfest ," a preconference for the annual Access conference in Canada. A group of technologists and librarians get together, make a big list of technology problems they are working on, select several of the more pressing ones, and break into small groups to work out solutions. For 24 hours, they pound away at the problems and frequently come up with good ideas, which are then shared by the community. Dan compared this to the "Anatomy of a Gamer" slide you may have seen in the Scan or in our presentations.  Finally, Dan talked about the way people use information today. Not to take anything away from the traditional reference interview, Dan noted that discussions with a reference librarian are only one part of the user's interaction with the infosphere. He said that the infosphere continually surrounds us today, we can never completely walk away from it. Librarians need to understand their role in this environment if we are to be successful in it.  In my next post, I'll talk about what Cindy Cunningham had to say.

       Here we blog!  I'm so excited. I've been in Orlando 2 days now, helping set up for the  urlLink 2004 ALA Annual conference --but today the conference-goers have finally started to arrive. Tomorrow it all gets started with the  urlLink OCLC Symposium . Cindy Cunningham and Dan Chudnov...both excellent speakers.  Plan to blog from the Symposium floor--but this is a loaner laptop. Sometime the coolest technology is priced just out of reach of the average technorati's salary! But I don't need to tell you that, do I? :)   Is Orlando full of aliens?  Aliens-- urlLink the space kind . Not  urlLink the INS kind .  I've only seen hotel staff, wait staff and tourists so far. Does anyone really live here? Have the distinct feeling that no self-respecting Orlandonian would be seen here unless they worked here. True?   It reminds me of  urlLink Waikiki , done mainland-style. With no beach and a lot less Japanese signage. (I used to live in Hawaii, so I could say that with all  urlLink kama'aina  aloha.)  Tune in tomorrow--maybe I'll find an alien hiding outside the exhibit hall!

      We're close to announcing this blog to our world, so now's a good time to say some things about what we still need to do with the blog, and tell you ways to talk to us.  We need to make it clearer who's 'speaking' by moving the name of the poster up in the entry. We need to make the Atom feed link appear. We need to darken the type face. We need to index the entries. We need to add a  urlLink Technorati  bubble ( urlLink Tim Bray's blog shows this ). And a bunch of other stuff. Bear with us as we eat our own cooking. In the environmental scan we clearly suggested it was time for libraries and contiguous organizations (OCLC, eg) to get outside of the building and connect with our communities--potential and current--with a more human voice.   So, we're diving into the blogosphere with the hope that the human voices at OCLC have a venue in which to talk and listen. There have always been wonderfully interesting people working at OCLC but we know too that OCLC is often thought of as the "9,000 pound gorilla"....a behemoth in the information jungle, cutting a wide swath as it lumbers on its way. Collectively, maybe that's the effect, but George and Alice and I are dedicated "librarianistas" (is George a "librarianisto"?)as keenly interested in a robust place for libraries in the "infosphere" as you are. And there's hundreds of OCLC employees who are too. We intend to have guest editors pop in to "It's all good" so you don't hear from us only.   You can post comments to this blog (although we'll remove really offensive ones...racial, sexual, etc etc comments won't be tolerated. And spam will go too).  You can email the editors directly. George's e-mail is needhamg@oclc.org and mine (Alane) is wilsona@oclc.org. I'd tell you Alice's too but haven't asked her yet if this is OK. She's somewhere here in Orlando for ALA too, but I haven't connected with her yet.  And in the car on the way to the airport ( urlLink Port Columbus ...go figure. Not a body of water for miles) I heard a cut from Patti Smith's new album,  urlLink Trampin' . I haven't listened to her for years but it was really good! Literate and passionate and I think I have to get it. That, and Diana Krall's latest,  urlLink The Girl in the Other Room .

      Yes, really.  urlLink Jerome Conley  is the Head of Special Libraries at Miami University, but he is also serving his second term as Mayor of Oxford. You just never know who's in your audience....I was at the bit in the presentation about libraries as a third place and said, flippantly, "it's a good sound bite for politicians." Jerome is too nice a guy to take me to task for this.  Here's one thing that seemed to resonate with the Miami U librarians as it has with other audiences: perhaps there are two distinct service models looming in our future that reconcile the paradox of library as place seeming to be increasingly important to communities, and the need to disaggregate library content from the building and get it out to the open web where it can be found and used and valued. Looked at through the lens of current organizational structures in libraries, the challenge is extremely difficult. But, let's twist the kaleidoscope and look at the new pattern.  What if the physical library and its set of services was a separate organizational structure--different staff, different content, different services--from the virtual library? Of course, some libraries are not big enough to have completely different staff and content but the skill sets needed in these two "places" are different and getting more so. Is it really important to users of virtual library services to have to navigate a simulacrum of the physical library before they find (or not) the content? It is to the administrators of those physical spaces but I doubt it is to most people on the "SFO" (search, find, obtain) trail.   OK, this is one of my hobby horses. I'll get down now.

      Once again, the presentation of the scan trends changed a meeting. The TLN meeting (held in Novi, just outside of Detroit) was attended by around 70 public library directors, and library trustees, as well about 30 TLN staff and Board members, and the speakers. The order of the day was my presentation (preceded by a short welcome from Christie Brandau, the  urlLink State Librarian ) and a presentation by Kurt Metzger, a demographer from the  urlLink Centre for Urban Studies  at Wayne State University. After lunch, the group was to divide into discussion groups and wrestle with issues related to TLN's role for members of its cooperative.   With the trustees in mind, I tried to avoid industry jargon and  urlLink acronyms  in the presentation but didn't succeed. A trustee told me at lunch she'd really liked the presentation but had to write down all the terms she didn't know to check with her library director later. For the life of me, I couldn't think of what words I used that would be mysterious and unfortunately I didn't see her list. One of the TLN Board members said, "forgive me, but what does OCLC do?" And I realized I'd made a basic mistake: I had not told the group about OCLC. Sales presentation training 101: Me, my company. Tell them about you, tell them about your company. Oh well, at least no one in that group can complain about OCLC taking a bully pulpit.   So, after lunch Michael Deller, the TLN Director announced that a new discussion topic had been added at the request of attendees: the library as third place. Those of us making presentations on the scan (mostly Cathy De Rosa, George and me) have found this idea really resonating with librarians--not just public librarians. I had talked in the morning about the power of this phrase and idea, and suggested libraries could build marketing and advocacy programs around it. Not the least of its power is its brevity--something politicians would like!   I joined the discussion table for the third place--lots of discussion, lots of ideas, many related to advocacy that TLN could undertake on behalf of its members. And an interesting digression on the same topic that "Sam" told George at CLA: the need to expand the kind of people hired to work in libraries. One young library director said she'd love to be able to hire a social worker who could then handle and help the many people using public libraries who really need a social worker, not a librarian. Cool idea, I thought! What better place to help people navigate the thickets of social services than a welcoming, neutral information-rich environment?   Lorcan Dempsey, OCLC VP of Research and Chief Strategist, and also Cathy's and my co-author of the scan, gets the credit for including "the third place" in the chapter on Research and Learning. No wonder he's the  urlLink Chief Strategist .

      On June 16th, I covered my Victoria, BC trip but didn't share any feedback I got. And on the 18th, I spoke to participants of the TLN planning meeting. On the 21st, I was at  urlLink Miami University  in Oxford, OH to speak to the library's staff. All told, I talked 'scan' to about 160 people.   I think I was luckier than George with the Canadian audience. I am not sure I was the top banana but I wasn't the peel. I followed Paul McCormick from  urlLink Libraries and Archives Canada  who was seeking opinions from the CARL Directors to contribute to the strategic planning for this new organization. LAC came into being on October 2, 2002 when the Government of Canada created the Library and Archives of Canada, a new agency that combined the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada.   The facilitator gamely tried to get the audience to participate in an information gathering exercise she had carefully crafted. Not easy to do with directors: "why do we have to do it that way?" "I'm just going to tell you what I think." I think the facilitator was the peel at this meeting.  I zipped through my presentation--I didn't have a lot of time and there wasn't an opportunity for much discussion then, but clearly, the wheels in brains were grinding. During the afternoon session which was to flesh out the goals of the CARL strategic plan, energy and participation sagged.  urlLink Mike Ridley , from the University of Guelph (you'll see he's a savvy guy from his bio) piped up and said he cared about CARL, thought the exercise was important, but that he just didn't feel the passion he thought he should. What was wrong? Many in his peer group agreed, and one reason was that some thought the issues raised during my presentation of trends changed thinking and needed to be discussed more. So, in one sense, the process was derailed as the goal of the meeting was not met. On the other hand, a better plan will be the result.   Far from being gloomy, the CARL directors seem to be positive about their challenges.  urlLink Mark Haslett   (do follow this link...I love the last category in the sidebar: " Stuff, Other ")from the University of Waterloo, said (I'm paraphrasing): "I think this is an incredibly exciting time to be working in libraries. It's like being in a playground with a bunch of new toys."  And then after a hard day of work, we all went to the  urlLink Swan Suites Hotel  for cocktails on the roof terrace of the  urlLink penthouse suite , (fabulous, fabulous space) and then dinner in their restaurant, Wild Saffron. Don't you wish your university owned a hotel like this? The  urlLink University of Victoria  was willed the Swan, along with several other heritage buildings a few years back. Marnie Swanson, the University Librarian, thinks U Vic may be the only university that owns a brewpub. Prosit!

      You might be able to tell that I am catching up after 6 working days out of the office.    Here's the bib info for books that present the idea of the third place that we've talked about here, and in the Scan.  1.  Better Together: restoring the American community  by Robert Putnam and Lewis M. Feldstein, with Don Cohen (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2003) This one has a chapter on the Chicago Public Library  "Better Together tells the stories of twelve different groups: from a community organization to a church, as well as a dance group and a web site, from a union to a branch library, a Fortune 500 corporation and a neighborhood group, to name a few. The stories hold in common the building up of community, of social capital. It is the best book of general interest that I have read in more than a year." (Amazon reviewer's comments)  2.  Celebrating the Third Place: Inspiring Stories About the "Great Good Places" at the Heart of Our Communities . by Ray Oldenburg (Marlowe & Company; January 9, 2002)  3.  The Great Good Place: Cafes, Coffee Shops, Bookstores, Bars, Hair Salons, and Other Hangouts at the Heart of a Community . by Ray Oldenburg (Marlowe & Company; 3rd edition August 1, 1999)

      This is the quote from  urlLink The Cluetrain Manifesto  that Alice mentioned. Amazingly, this content was published in 1999 before blogs began. But isn't this an elegant way to describe the reason for business blogging?     "To speak with a human voice, companies must share the concerns of their communities. But first, they must belong to a community. Companies must ask themselves where their corporate cultures end. If their cultures end before the community begins, they will have no market. Human communities are based on discourse - on human speech about human concerns. The community of discourse is the market. Companies that do not belong to a community of discourse will die."    In fact, it seems to me that one of the wonderful unexpected consequences of the Internet and a webby world is that the human voice is on the ascendancy. Blogs, for one, have introduced vivid personalities to the web. I read many blogs regularly and I know only a very few of the authors personally. But, I feel as if I know the others. Their voices are personal, credible, and part of my community. I value their presence. And soon, as we build the "It's all good" blog we'll add links to our favorite blogs.

      Scanbloggers, it has come to our attention that Scanblog is not the catchiest name ever...so we pondered for at least a week and now the moment of inspiration came upon us:  It's all good  "We say that all the time!" I remark excitedly to Alane, sensing the moment has arrived. So that's all to say: we like it. But  urlLink you tell us --love it or hate it?  So who's bought how many copies of  urlLink Bill Clinton's book  for their libraries? Or are you waiting for the NetLibrary eBook of it?  I found  urlLink Clinton & Me  in WorldCat, but not  My Life . Maybe it hasn't been loaded into the pilot yet?  Alane just clipped a piece from the Cluetrain Manifesto, a document the Web community has been living by for years. She's posting it soon.  For now, she's also come up with some  talk story  (as we say in Hawaii) about  urlLink Macromedia and why they blog .  urlLink Macromedia  is one of those companies I've admired for years.   More to come  George, Alane and I are all headed to Orlando this week. We plan to blog from the OCLC Symposium, the exhibit show floor, membership meetings and more. Look for our daily dispatches!

      Today I had 20 minutes to talk about the E-Scan at the OCLC Update Luncheon at the Canadian Library Association. Today I learned that 20 minutes after lunch is not a good time to talk about the E-Scan. There wasn't time for the discussion that makes this thing so vital and interesting, and after a lunch (heavy on the carbs) many in the audience were flagging. The other speakers before me set me up fine, so it's not like there was some buzzkiller I can blame; it just didn't jell.  The interesting thing though, is that before the lunch, I had a wonderful conversation with the director of a large Canadian research library. I will call this person Sam to avoid any complications. Sam said that the University Library is in big transition. This Library has a number of backlogged projects, major retrocon work pending, a subject library that is classified in an idiosyncratic system, a new ILS system being installed, and a building project. Sam seemed tired just clicking them off the list.  But unbidden, Sam started talking about one of the findings of the study that has gotten less attention than others. Sam said that the library has had a number of retirements, and this has allowed the Library to employ new staff with experience and skills that aren't traditional "librarian" skills. Sam said, "We don't learn about how to run facilities in library school, why should we expect someone with an MLS to do this?" Sam talked about the need to focus on the core competencies the librarians do have, and work those competencies tirelessly to provide the best services possible. Then, hire PR people, fundraisers, and systems staff that can do those jobs well. Sam also said that even if there are certain jobs the library staff can do well, the library director today MUST consider if this is the best use of that person's time. "Sure, we COULD do this job," Sam said about a project a staff member had proposed, "But why SHOULD we? There are people who can do that for a lot less cost, and then we can use our staff to provide more direct service to our users."  One of the things I've always believed is that if we want other people to respect the MLS, we need to respect the skills and education others bring to their jobs. I don't want an MLS as my lawyer, my accountant, or my building manager. I also don't want a plumber covering the reference desk. This is why we specialize.

      Today, I was in Mansfield, Ohio, for the annual INFOhio Planning Conference (which I mistakenly referred to as a "retreat" in an earlier post). INFOhio is Ohio's set of statewide resources for school libraries, a complement to  urlLink OHIOLINK  (for academic libraries) and  urlLink OPLIN  (for public libraries).  I took this speaking assignment with a little trepidation, because I wasn't sure how school librarians would react to the scan. I didn't need to worry. These folks were ON, and they were eager to talk.  First, it was like old home week. Terri Fredericka, the director of INFOhio, has been a friend for years. Joanna McNally, the president of OELMA, was in my groups at Library Leadership Ohio and Snowbird, and will be a major leader in libraries in years to come. Ellen Stepanian would be a good role model for Joanna; she's been a leader in school libraries on the local, state, and national level for years, and was a mentor with me at Library Leadership Ohio several years ago. I know I learned at least as much from her as the program participants did.  Several things really seemed to resonate with this group. The concept of getting to the "smallest publishable unit" seemed to carry, and they were amazed with some of the statistics about  urlLink I-Tunes , and about Microsoft's  urlLink Janus  project.  But what really got things cooking was when I asked about the concept of IT professionals moving from the "T" to the "I" in their titles. There was a spirited discussion about the way IT staff are working with faculty to corner the market on classroom information delivery through services like Blackboard and WebCT, leaving librarians out of the process. So who's fault is this? (By the way, I had enough sense not to ask the question quite this blatantly---it came from an audience member!) Some of the people in the room said school librarians need to get out of their rooms and insinuate themselves in this process. Getting the library's website and information connections visible in the classroom systems should be a top priority for school librarians, they said.  After I finished speaking, a high school librarian came up to me and said she was thrilled that OCLC had seen some of the things she's been seeing in the environment. She said that she'd had her library remodeled this year, moving the books to compact shelving and putting the information technology front and center. She had convinced her board that the library had to reflect the way young people are learning now, not when we were in school. (I don't know about you, but my biggest obstacle in going to grade school was evading the dinosaurs.) Several librarians volunteered to participate in focus groups if OCLC wants to learn more about their segment of the market.  This was such an energizing event that I can't wait to get to Victoria tomorrow and take my turn talking to the Canadian Library Association. I wonder why Delta wouldn't let me print out my boarding pass tonight. Hope it's not a bad omen...

      Alane here, reporting in from sunny, fabulous  urlLink Victoria , British Columbia. Victoria, for those unfamiliar with this part of Canada, is the provincial capital, located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. It's about a 3 hour ferry ride or an 40 minute plane ride from Vancouver or Seattle. The main part of the city is located on a big curved bay and I can see the ocean from my hotel window and the sea planes taking off and landing. If I go out on the balcony and crane my head a bit I can see the mountains, still snow-capped. The Parliament buildings are very close, and at night are outlined with 3,330 white lights. It's a very beautiful place.   Like George I have two scan presentations this week. As he mentioned, one was yesterday, to the CARL (Canadian Association of Research Libraries) directors, who are having their annual general meeting before  urlLink CLA  starts. In addition to the directors, Kjell Nilsson, the Deputy National Librarian of the  urlLink Royal National Library of Sweden  was attending, as was Jan Cellucci, the wife of the U.S. ambassador to Canada, former Massachusetts governor  urlLink Paul Cellucci  (actually his title is Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States to Canada!), and my old classmate and friend, Deb Debruijn, the Executive Director of the  urlLink Canadian National Site Licensing Program .   Jan Cellucci was working as a librarian at Boston College until her husband's appointment. When she moved to Ottawa she wanted to remain active in the profession. She visits libraries and archives around the country, and then, when the opportunity arises, she meets with provincial and federal politicians to talk about these institutions with them. What a great thing to be doing! This sort of advocacy is much needed. Thanks on behalf of Canadian librarians, Jan.  For me, coming to Canadian library events is always an opportunity to see many ex-colleagues and friends. Among the CARL directors are quite a few people I've worked with, and hung out with at conferences. The director I have known the longest is Carolynne Presser,  urlLink University of Manitoba .  When I began as an undergraduate at the  urlLink University of Waterloo , 29 years ago, I began working in the library to supplement my puny student loan. It was then that I discovered that there were some pretty cool things happening in the library as I was part of the big crew working on switching from a punch card local system to a GEAC system that used bar codes! (Yes, I have been working in libraries long enough that I remember when bar codes on books were new technology.) Carolynne was then the head of the Engineering, Math and Science Library and I worked there for two summers. At that time, I had no idea I'd go to library school and end up standing in front of a bunch of research library directors that included Carolynne and others I've known for many years, being billed as a guru of the OCLC environmental scan! I am not sure if there's a  urlLink collective noun  for a group of research library directors but it should be something like, "a pride of directors" as being in a room full of them is akin, I fancy, to being in a room full of tigers. Nice pussycats most of the time but dangerous is provoked. They're just used to being in charge.   I'll be just outside Detroit on Friday, talking to the directors in  urlLink TLN  (The Library Network) at a meeting called Congruency: TLN Setting Goals and Creating a New Plan of Service. We've heard many libraries and some organizations are using the OCLC scan as a planning document, and Cathy De Rosa and I have both made presentations on the scan as part of a planning effort--which is always interesting and enlightening.    urlLink Happy Bloomsday!

      This week, I have two speaking engagements to talk about the Scan.   On Wednesday, I'll talk to the annual INFOhio planning retreat in beautiful downtown  urlLink Mansfield, Ohio .  urlLink INFOhio  provides databases to K-12 schools thoughout Ohio on a statewide basis. This group includes both IT staff and school librarians (are they still called school media specialists?) so it will be interesting to see how they react to the Scan's contention that the locus of IT is moving from the "T" (technology) to the "I" (information).  urlLink The Ohio Educational Library Media Association   underwrote  urlLink a very interesting report  on the role of school libraries in educational attainment, and I'll be weaving some of the results of the report into my comments.  Friday, I'll be at the  urlLink Canadian Library Association   meeting in Victoria, BC. I'll be part of the OCLC Update Luncheon there, and as always, it's a pleasure talking to people who are enjoying a free meal. But I'm really curious to see how the report resonates in Canada. Today, Alane Wilson (one of the Scan's gurus) is talking to the  urlLink Canadian Association of Research Libraries  annual meeting, also in Victoria, so we will compare notes when we're back here in Dublin.  Happy Flag Day!

      George ended his last post with a comment about libraries as the "third place."   What is the 3rd place?  By definition, it's somewhere that's Not Home, and Not Work/School: a literal "third place."  So I started to do a little research on "third place" areas. (Okay, it was all of a single Amazon.com search...) The editorial review (from Publishers Weekly, no less) for what came up --( urlLink Celebrating the Third Place: Inspiring Stories About the "Great Good Places" at the Heart of Our Communities ) -- instead of what I wanted ( urlLink Better Together: Restoring the American Community ) was enlightening:  What Oldenburg calls "the third place" is different from home and work (the first and second places respectively) it's somewhere people can relax in good company on a regular basis. In this collection of 19 essays, proprietors and patrons of those third places describe how their establishments came into being and what exactly gives them their appeal. These third places aren't just diners and coffeehouses: there are establishments as disparate as Annie's Gift and Garden Shop, in Amherst, Mass., whose witty and provocative billboards provide a jumping-off point for conversation within the community, and Old St. George, an espresso bar located within a church's sacristy in Cleveland, Ohio. There's also the "great good gym" and, perhaps most surprising, an essay claiming prison to be the third place for many disadvantaged in American society. These charming and often thought-provoking essays, each written in a voice distinct as the place discussed, provide food for thought into the isolation our modern conveniences bring and people's need to come together as a community. This book will strike a comforting chord for those questioning the status quo and desiring to live a more authentic and connected way of life.    The review mentions coffee shops, gyms, even sacristies of churches...but significantly does NOT mention libraries. Now why is that?   Starbucks rival?  The other piece that struck me was a piece by Howard Rheingold on the  urlLink Cybercafe Society . Part of it is fascinating to me, from a brand perspective that he's linked Starbucks to FedEx and Kinko's as if it's the next logical move all 3 organizations!  Of course, anyone who knows me from me previous academic life, knows I studied "crowds in modern literature" in graduate school. So his description of our post-modern socio-knowledge cybernomadic mobs is interesting...if only for the language he uses. Do we have a mob mentality, when it comes to technological enhancements?  What say you, scanbloggers? --Alice

      California was great, but I really think they need me out there. The day I left, the  urlLink levee broke near Stockton , and the following day,  urlLink Ronald Reagan  died. Coincidence? I think not...   Advisory Committee meeting  Anyway, back here in Dublin on Monday and Tuesday, we had a meeting of our Advisory Committee on Public Libraries. (You can see the  urlLink committee roster , but Helen, Gary, and Jane weren't in attendance.) Now I'm a former public library worker (18 years in  urlLink Buffalo NY ,  urlLink Charleston SC , and  urlLink Lancaster OH ) so I have a lot of respect and affection for public libraries and librarians, especially the group on this committee. Three presentations particularly seemed to catch fire with them.  Cathy De Rosa and Alane Wilson walked into the room, asked the Committee what they thought of the environmental scan, and then basically sat back for 75 minutes and listened to the committee members tell them where they thought public libraries were headed. It was a heady discussion, full of insights into the future of technology.   What they thought  This crew thinks that  1. public libraries aren't going to be able to claim the digital divide as a refuge much longer, as technology gets cheaper and more ubiquitous) 2. the descendents of cell phones are going to replace most of the technological arrows in our quiver soon, and we'd better to be ready to deliver services there 3. we still aren't doing a great job of snagging teenage users, although the libraries with dedicated teen space that's wide open and extremely  lightly  regulated have a better shot at keeping the 12 to 20 set.  4. Almost all of the group loves self-service everything, although Sheldon Kaye voiced his distaste for  urlLink airline self-service machines . He took a lot of kidding for that over the next day and a half.    One interesting insight: if public libraries appeal broadly and specifically to the young, they run the risk of alienating the older users. Older users are currently the majority of library users. More importantly in this context, they are the majority of people who  vote , as in voting for library levies. That'll slow down your more forward leaning thinking in a hurry.   Group Services  Then Doug Loynes came in and talked about  urlLink group catalog services . I thought this one  might be a throwaway on the agenda, but no---the committee saw exactly where this was going and had many questions and suggestions about the service. Jan Ison is from  urlLink Illinois , which is implementing group services in a big way this year, and she explained a lot about what they are doing. She made some converts, too.   Open WorldCat pilot  The last big discussion came about the  urlLink Open WorldCat pilot . Andy Boyer and Ericka McDonald had the committee dancing in the aisles (OK, a slight exaggeration) as they showed how  urlLink Google  and  urlLink Yahoo  have, each in their own way, harvested WorldCat records.  Dan Walters from Las Vegas-Clark County Public Library saw this as a long range replacement for the OPAC, which he said is a badly underused asset in most libraries. Everyone agreed that putting WorldCat records where internet searchers might actually find them, i.e., in the major search engines, was going to have a huge impact on libraries, and they didn't seem to think it could happen soon enough.   Public libraries as the 3rd place  Public librarians have long understood the role of library as a " urlLink third place ," and this committee can make that case more clearly, and more knowledgably, and with more passion, than nearly any other assortment of people you're likely to meet.

      As I mentioned yesterday, I'm in northern California doing a few library visits. Today, we met with Bruce Miller and his colleagues at the library for the University of California at Merced.   What, you've never heard of UC Merced? At the moment, the university is pretty much a  urlLink construction site , but on that campus, scheduled to open in September 2005, are the  urlLink seeds of the future library . Bruce and his team have the opportunity that most librarians would trade at least one major organ for:  to create a new library from scratch . And this is a university that will take its library VERY seriously.    A 21st century model  Bruce was the first academic hire at UC Merced, a position that indicates how strongly the university chancellor felt about the library. Bruce set out to build a facility, a collection, and, most important, a philosophy of service, that would reflect a 21st century model, rather than a 19th century one.   The first thing that surprised me:  no OPAC terminals . Most students will be coming to campus with PCs or highly enhanced PDAs, and the entire building with be wireless enabled and have network connections for the tethered. If you don't have a PC, they'll check one out to you. All of a sudden, there is no heavy investment in PCs for an OPAC, no waiting lines for an internet PC, and no time when the investment is sitting there idle. You can actually use attractive furniture if you don't have to keep drilling holes to run wires through it!  There will be  no paper journals . The current issues may be available in paper, but there won't be backstock on the shelves. That's what e-journals, JSTOR, and the extant UC journal collections are for. Circulating and reference books will be on the shelves together.   Special collections  Wait until you see the  urlLink collections of Asian art  that the library is digitizing in high quality TIFF files. But the library's web site won't be anything glorious. Instead, it will be  urlLink highly functional . The goal will be to put links to the library on the sites the students are already using.   Designed for studying (with snacks!)  The heart of this new library will be a central tower for reading, discussion, studying. The library will share its building with the student affairs offices (like the bursar and the registrar), an arrangement Bruce strongly supported because it puts the library where the students are, instead of trying to dragoon them in. Oh, and by the way, food and drink will be permitted.   A physical embodiment of the  Scan   It seemed to me, and to Pam Bailey and Karin Ford of OCLC Western Service Center who are guiding me on this trip, UC Merced embodies many of the ideas we gathered and shared in the environmental scan. Memphis, Denver, Seattle, and a few other major urban libraries constructed in the last decade have offered direction for public libraries for the future; UC Merced may provide a similar role for academic and research libraries. The whole focus of this institution is on meeting user needs, students and faculty alike, while stripping away the barriers that make library service inconvenient or unpleasant.

      Hi, I'm George, and with the build up Alice gave me, I'm not sure what your expectations will be. But I'll give it my best shot.  As I write this post, I'm sitting in my room in a nice bed and breakfast a few blocks from the  urlLink state capitol building in Sacramento . I've been on the road a lot lately, talking about the environmental scan OCLC released in January. I'm pretty much of a ham---the light goes on when I open the refrigerator, and I do 10 minutes. So getting up and speaking in public is no big deal for me. But I've never had such good material to work from. The scan has energized a lot of people, so my presentations are closer to dialogues.   Today, the staff at the  urlLink State Library in California  shared their experiences and their reactions to the scan, and to a meeting we'd held in Columbus of state librarians in March. One of the issues they raised was the need to help libraries make a better case for explaining the value they add in return for the public (or institutional) funding they receive. They wondered if we can build a consistent message for libraries.  Later, we visited the  urlLink Sacramento Public Library . The director, Anne Marie Gold, and the  deputy director, Mark Parker, talked about some of the plans they are developing for the long range future of the library. Despite the battering their budget has taken, they are planning bold steps for the future.   Pam Bailey, the director of the  urlLink OCLC Western Services Center , made an astute observation. She said that she's been through too many economic recessions for libraries, but unlike the last recession in the 1990s, librarians seem more hopeful this time around, like there really is light at the end of the tunnel. The technology doesn't seem as overwhelming now. We're seeing technology as a tool, not as an end in itself, which means we can work with it instead of being dominated by it.   In other words, we have higher expectations that we've had in the past. Maybe we are excited by the fact that our users are learning to expect more from us, and we might even be able to deliver on those expectations.   Tomorrow, we visit the  urlLink University of Merced  and the  urlLink Stockton-San Joaquin Public Library . There's a great Western band called " urlLink The Sons of the San Joaquin ," [ urlLink Download their music ] and that's about all I know about the area. I'm expecting to learn more!  George

      We have another voice joining us. Scanbloggers, meet  George . He's quick to listen, quick to laugh and has been on the road lately, talking about the Scan and what it means to libraries.  He's going to share what insights he's heard...and push us to consider new interpretations of where we're going, as a community.  Of course, making your voice heard as a ScanBlogger is as easy as posting a comment. Anyone can  urlLink post a comment .  So how about it? How has the Scan--or the topics we've covered here--influenced your library?  Alice

      Speaking of which, I have to say I had no idea that George and Joyce (his wife) were cruise people. I am only exhibiting my own woeful stereotypes here. Because I think a cruise would be awful I am always taken aback when people I like and admire (like George and Joyce) do things I don't like--&nbsp;they should care anyway!&nbsp; I am the sort of person who feels put-upon after a short elevator ride with strangers, especially when they make conversation so being on a very large elevator with many strangers for days on end seems Heronimous Bosch-ish to me.&nbsp; But, I admit I know zippo about cruising.   What I had meant to say was, here I am at the Grand Hyatt in D.C., a hotel I realized I'd been in many times before at various ALAs. It's just around the corner from the convention center. I don't think the OCLC staff have stayed here but I've been in the building. Mind you, I have never been here while there was a karaoke event happening and as the rooms face inward I can hear the wannabe American Idols.  Can you remember the first library conference you went to where a whole new world opened up to you? In my library career, this was the LITA conference in Denver in...hmm, maybe 1993 or 4? These cathartic events are always a combination of your own experience (or lack of), the event itself, your receptiveness to new ideas and the content of the conference.   Well, even if the events don't live up to the billings, I am feeling the same way after a thorough reading of the conference sessions at the World Future conference. A whole new vocabulary -- "enterbrainment", "digitalization", "transmodern", "choice-oriented behavior" and "regenopasal". What fun!   I am thinking ALA and other library orgs need to have "futurist" sections...we&nbsp; have loads of format and market segment organizations. How about sections and committees who do what we did in the scan, on an ongoing basis?

       urlLink David Leslie  works here at OCLC in QA. He was our first commenter, and has posted several thoughtful comments since. He is very interested in using wikis for group work and promises Alice and me a demo of a wiki he'd like to use for project management information. He sent me the email I duplicate below...I had read Cory Doctorow's article ages ago but it was buried in a big file. This is actually a challenge of "responsible blogging." How to make sure that interesting things are shared with the blogosphere? There's so much interesting stuff to talk about!   Here's David's comments about Cory:        One of the most passionate defenders of the ebook is Cory Doctorow. Cory is an author, editor of the influential  urlLink Boing Boing  blog while holding down a gig with the EFF. Cory allows people to freely download his books from his website which is amazing given that these books are also published by  urlLink Tor,  one of the leading science fiction publishers. The  urlLink link  is to a talk Cory gave on the subject of ebooks. In the talk, he discusses the problems that have plagued not the format of ebooks but how they have been marketed. He also notes his views on how copyright is for the most part broken.

      I'm in Chicago this week attending a board meeting of  urlLink Learning Point Associates , an organization dedicated to helping school districts, principals, and teachers improve learning by creating various systems to improve teaching, create more accurate measurement of results, and to allow policymakers to beast their decisions on facts. I got into a very interesting discussion with one of the leadership team of the organization about some of the finding of e-scan. He was telling me about his 17-year old son who plays "Blackhawk Down" online. He has a whole squad that "reports" to him, and he considers his game mates his friends. He has created a whole world that didn't, that couldn't have, existed a few years ago. We pondered what this means for the future of education and learning, and how to teach information literacy to students who already know more about technology than most of their teachers.  Educators are under the gun right now. Under the "No Child Left Behind" law, school administrators for the first time are being legally compelled to produce results or face losing their jobs. Learning Point Associates is trying to help schools prepare for these challenges. As one of my fellow directors, the chief education officer for a large Midwestern state, said yesterday, a school superintendent had told him that in his 37 years of experience he had never seen a school district superintendent fired because his kids weren't learning. They had been fired for poor football results, transportation issues, bad calls on snow days, but never for failure to education. The new law changes that, requiring wholesale personnel changes in schools that consistently fail to produce.  We can argue for years over whether this is appropriate or not, but this is the law, and no one on this board sees the law changing no matter who is elected in November.  But outside of partisan arguments, doesn't it seem like there is a marvelous opportunity for public libraries to help here? To be advocates for helping toddlers enter school ready to learn, to help young students read for pleasure, to keep middle schoolers engaged during the summer, to polish the credentials of graduating high schoolers? This is where public librarians could step into the role of true community partners, without changing their mission, without feeling like they've sold out. And they could truly make their communities better.  I'm off the blog for a week or so for some  urlLink R and R . I'm sure Alane and Alice will keep you informed and challenged in my absence. Or, as  urlLink Groucho Marx  once observed when he was leaving a party, "Outside of the improvement, you'll never notice the difference!" (Boat drinks for everyone!)

      Tomorrow, I am heading to Washington, D.C. to attend the  urlLink World Futures Society  conference.&nbsp;   We often get asked now how we went about researching, compiling and writing the Environmental Scan because people are interested in doing similar work within their own environments as a part of strategic planning processes.&nbsp;And we tell them...but I am going to make you come back later&nbsp;and read how we did it because it deserves its own story.   But I am going to this conference that will be attended by " urlLink professional futurists " so that I can learn about techniques and tools that real environmental scanners use. I'll be in 2 full-day classes before attending conference sessions so I should have some interestings things to share... although perhaps not as interesting as Jessamyn's posts to her  urlLink DNC blog .   Alice has been on vacation in New York city , and George has been incommunicado in meetings for the last two days. Alice may have stories from NYC. She did wonder, in an email to George and me, whether OCLC needed a NYC-based blogger, so she must have had a good time.   Look for a new edition of the OCLC Five Year Information Format Trends report very soon. OCLC published the  urlLink first one in 2003 , and I, along with a bunch of other staff, have been working on the 2004 version. We're just about done--it's down to the incredibly tedious but necessary work of checking commas and triple checking numbers and facts. And I am very grateful for Brad "Mr Chicago Style Manual" Gauder's eagle eye.   &nbsp;

      A few days ago, I posted (as did many other bloggers) a note about Duke University giving all incoming freshmen iPods already loaded with relevant content.  urlLink Cathy De Rosa , the VP of Marketing and Library Services, mine and Alice's boss, and one of the authors of the Environmental Scan visited  urlLink Duke University  very recently to give a presentation on the Scan. David Ferriero, the University Librarian (and soon to become the Director of the Research Libraries at the  urlLink New York Public Library ), told Cathy in a conversation that the iPod was a library-driven initiative.&nbsp; Nothing I've seen written on this yet has credited the library. So, Mr. Ferriero, kudos to you and your staff!

       Yesterday on WNYC's excellent radio program "  urlLink  On the Media   "&nbsp;there was a story about the bloggers who have been given press credentials for the Democratic National Conference in Boston this week. This seems to me to be yet another link in the growth of respectability of the web as a news source. One of the people interviewed in the story noted that "the media" have (has?) never been a consistent, monolithic thing. Newspaper reporters fought giving credentials to radio broadcasters. There was a long argument about allowing television to cover conventions live. (Digression: this&nbsp;story made&nbsp;me wonder: if TV had not covered the 1968&nbsp;Democratic Convention live from Chicago, would Hubert Humphrey have been elected president? It also makes me wonder if some blogger could become&nbsp;Boston's John Chancellor, under attack on the convention floor for trying to cover the news?)  &nbsp;  Not everyone with a laptop at Boston may be a blogger, though. An interesting article in today's   urlLink  Information Week Daily   &nbsp;that the wired network at the Fleet Center could be vulnerable to hacking attacks through its wireless network. Every coin has two sides, I guess.

       urlLink ResourceShelf  notes a really cool thing  urlLink Vivisimo  has done to the Final Report of the 9/11 Commission. "Keyword search the entire 500+ page document and then review the first 200 matching paragraphs in breakable folders. Another useful resource from Vivisimo." According to their web site, Vivisimo's clustering engine categorizes textual information from&nbsp;a single or different content repositories into&nbsp;on-the-fly into meaningful folders.   And there are about 30  urlLink universities  apparently using the clustering engine....and here is why, according to Vivisimo:     The search function at university websites shows its content as long, insufferable lists of search results. Alumni, prospective students, visitors, and university members view few, if any, pages before their patience with the format is exhausted, so much of what a university has to offer is simply overlooked.   "Long, insufferable lists of search results..."&nbsp; Substitute "university" with "library OPAC" or "FirstSearch" and that would about describe the result, I think.&nbsp; Seeing I have the bully pulpit here, I have to tell you, dear readers, that I have been a squeaky wheel here at the OCLC Mothership on the matter of using visualization tools and/or content clustering tools like Vivisimo as an alternate way of searching WorldCat and other FirstSearch databases, for, oh, about 2 1/2 years.&nbsp; The lack of such alternate ways of viewing&nbsp;WorldCat search results will give you a clue as to how much grease&nbsp;this wheel got, so far.   Which reminds me. I went to&nbsp;an OCLC Inclusion Training session yesterday (because we realize that being a global cooperative means more than saying we are) and our Director of HR, Mark Matson, gave this example. In the U.S. and Canada, we use the phrase "the squeaky wheel gets the grease" in an admiring sense...that people who put themselves forward are rewarded. However, in Asian cultures this saying is used: "the nail that sticks up is the one that gets pounded down." &nbsp;But, I'm thinking that many people might think their work place experiences resemble the Asian proverb more than the North American one?   And I am definitely not remarking on my personal experience of working at OCLC. The very fact of my continuing employment (going on 8 years now) is proof that&nbsp;all nails that stick up here are not pounded down. Mind you, I do have a few pound marks... all well-earned though. &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      One of the concerns I've had about my fellow&nbsp;librarians over the years is that we have a hard time learning from other disciplines and applying it to our work. The last couple of posts on this blog about learning from retailing about how to present a collection are perfect examples of this.  Last month at the ALA Conference, I saw a demonstration of a product that combines the best of what we learn in libraries with the latest in mapping and GIS technology. Please note,&nbsp;I am not endorsing this product, but I am saying it's a way to think differently about how to use things other people have already learned to improve what we do.    urlLink Public-Library.com  demonstrated a system that provides a look at&nbsp;a library's&nbsp;service area&nbsp;to see who (at the street and block level, not at a house-by-house level) is using&nbsp;its facilities. It&nbsp;tells where&nbsp;the concentrations of heaviest use are, and provides sound data to develop ideas about how to site a facility, or when it's time to look for a new location. It works with the data from&nbsp;an integrated library system to provide real time tracking of usage. And the output is strikingly clear maps that plainly show these data points.   This seems to me to be a good medium step for libraries that want to preserve user privacy, but also want to mine their data to look for trends in usage and areas for growth. If they could figure out a way to add in a geographic look at who is hitting your web site and other online resources, they could provide a more complete picture. Until then, this seems like it could be a useful tool.

       "Duke University will give each of its 1,650 incoming freshmen a free iPod this fall as part of an initiative to foster innovative uses of technology in the classroom, the school said Monday."  urlLink Wired News  , July 20, 2004   This goes a long way beyond the  urlLink licensing of Napster  for streaming music that some universities have done on behalf of their students. The iPods will come loaded with content relevant to the students: orientation material and the academic calendar for starters. Duke expects students will download course content, audio books, and even record lectures and take oral notes using voice recorders--and music.     "The university also will create a Web site modeled on the Apple iTunes site from which students can download music and course content from faculty, including language lessons, lectures and audio books. The iTunes site allows users to download music legally...The program fits into university plans to use more technology in teaching, said Tracy Futhey, Duke's vice president for information technology. "This was a project aimed at satisfying those goals through a device that is immensely popular with students," Futhey said. " From  urlLink here .

      One of my colleagues today remarked about&nbsp;a library's physical layout and appearance--and compared it to a retail space.&nbsp;Physical layout and signage is something&nbsp;I would wager that most library staff and users take for granted, once there are enough computers, chairs, materials and librarians....they've done their job, now they just need people.   Not so fast  My colleague shared his first impressions of the space: "dim, disorderly and random."  Not such an auspicious beginning. He explains that,  "after entering past a circ worker who ignores you, the first thing you encounter isn't a list of the days events, nor a well-designed way-finding system, nor a compelling presentation of the newest additions to the collection. No, what you see are discarded books and magazines, piled up in a wheeled cart, donated by the public.&nbsp; The unconscious message:  This is the place where your books can come to die. &nbsp; It's like putting the dorkiest fashions no one wants at the front of  urlLink Banana Republic .&nbsp;"  And it got me to thinking about  physical layouts . My own beloved  urlLink Whetstone  (yay Clintonville!) has some lessons to be learned from  urlLink Easton , shopping mecca of the Midwest. What's wrong with borrowing a few lessons from the  urlLink Limited  playbook? They do signage and branding as good as anyone. (I see they've won  urlLink awards  for it!) We don't have to market lipstick, lingerie, lotions or lassos to take a few lessons down   Lessons from the Limited playbook    Put the fresh, new stuff up&nbsp;front, in an interesting visual display. Rotate it regularly.  Cut the visual clutter--posters for posters sake doesn't cut it.  Designate a community nexus area that is separate from the library per se. You aren't forced through the rock-climbing area every time you walk into  urlLink Galyan's  (a sports store--also a Limited Brand)...but it's available off to the side.  Usability test your way-finding signage. Can a novice user figure out how to locate your highest priority collections--without resorting to the OPAC? Do a walk-through after hours with a nonlibrarian and see what happens.    Retail revenge?  Bookstores seem to have no trouble with the idea of merchandising the knowledge experience. Because they're retail. Somehow we're (libraries) are expected to play in the same space (more on this later)--but we're not willing to admit that this is the model for the rest of our daily hunting-gathering-outside-the-home&nbsp;behavior. Can we use a few retail tactics to lead people to what they're already looking for?  So that leads me back to the title of today's musing...Scan eye for the Straight Library. It hearkens from Bravo's Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, where 5 gay men with subject specialties transform a hapless straight guy into a hip guy who's had a lifestyle makeover.  Can we do a "Scan Eye" makeover on a library?

      For those of you who've read the Scan, you'll know we lead off with a quote from  urlLink Mark Federman , who is Chief Strategist and head of McLuhan Management Studies at the  urlLink McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto . The quote is from a  urlLink key note speech  he gave at the 2003 Information Highways conference in which Federman encouraged delegates to apply Marshall McLuhan's laws of media to challenge and change conventional concepts in knowledge-based enterprises. McLuhan wrote his most influential works in the 60s and died in 1980 long before the ubiquitous Internet and the Web. So, it is amazing to me to re-read bits and pieces of McLuhan's writing and see how prophetic he was.   Now, if you're like most people, even if you own any of McLuhan's books, you probably haven't  read  them, just as most of us haven't really read Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, or anything by Jacques Derrida (I was an English grad student once--my pal Rick Martin always managed to sound incredibly 'up' on Derrida to the envy of the rest of us wretches in whatever postmodern lit course we were taking. Over beer once, Rick told us his secret: read the first and last ten pages or so. No one else has read more--probably not even the professor--and, voila, erudition!) because it's hard, epigrammatic, arcane, punny stuff. But, such is McLuhan's influence that many of his aphorisms are part of our cultural language.  I found this today and was stunned to see " Information overload equals pattern recognition ."     A  urlLink sampling  of McLuhan's favorite aphorisms suggest his rich, playful mind.     The medium is the message.  The greatest propaganda in the world is our mother tongue.  Schizophrenia may be a necessary consequence of literacy.  Violence is a lust for compensatory feedback.  War is compulsory education. Education is war.  Discovery comes from dialogue that begins with the sharing of ignorance.   Information overload equals pattern recognition .  Artists are the antennae of the race.  Electronics turns the earth into a global village.  We don't know who discovered water but we're pretty sure it wasn't the fish.  If you don't like these ideas, I've got others.    I did a bit of hunting around Google-space and found several  urlLink references  to this, although not a good bibliographic one. It was sometimes expressed as "data overload..." and one reference said McLuhan himself said he'd got it from IBM; another said it came from the Artificial Intelligence community.   Whatevah! The aspect of this that I find so bemuse-worthy is that we called the Scan "Pattern Recognition" in recognition of  urlLink William Gibson's book  of the same name as well as the branch of  artificial intelligence research concerned with the classification or  description of observations.. There are fans of Gibson's books among those of us involved in creating the Scan, and we thought the whole notion relevant to our goal. And Federman's article, that contained the phrase we now use a lot "what haven't you noticed lately", helped clarify my thinking as I wrestled with setting the stage for the Scan in the  urlLink Overview . But, I did not know that McLuhan had  also  used "pattern recognition" and in such a way as to fit right in with the sense of our title.   I love serendipity.     Addendum   (added July 21) : I forgot to include this yesterday. It's an interview with Marshall McLuhan,  urlLink published in Playboy  in 1969 (they really did have good interviews--and some people really did buy the magazine for these, not the pictures!)  As the intro to the interview notes, "The result [the interview] has considerably more lucidity and clarity than McLuhan's readers are accustomed to--perhaps because the Q. and A. format serves to pin him down by counteracting his habit of mercurially changing the subject in mid-stream of consciousness." Have to agree.

      One of the side effects of working on publicizing the&nbsp;OCLC Environmental Scan is that you start to see applications everywhere you turn.  &nbsp; For example, this past weekend, I made a conscious decision to just take the weekend off.  urlLink My wife  (Joyce Leahy---she's the one on the left if you happen to link to this picture) and I are hosting two high school students in our home in July. Sophie is from France and Berte is from Spain, and two nicer young people you've never met. On Saturday, Sophie, Berte,  urlLink Lace  (a friend of the family, a fellow librarian, and a baseball fan, unlike my wife), and I drove down to Cincinnati for  urlLink the game between the Reds and Cardinals . (As it turns out, Sophie and Berte happen to be baseball fans, and each had played softball at her high school.) Sitting in the  urlLink Great American Ball Park , my mind wandered to a time when baseball stadiums were not shopping malls with a diamond attached. Oh, don't get me wrong, the place is gorgeous, the sightlines are wonderful, the sound system actually works, and there's enough leg room between the rows. But there are ads everywhere, from the outfield walls (to be expected) to the cupholders in front of you. All of the concession stands are branded. It's not just a hot dog stand, it's The&nbsp; urlLink Skyline Chili  Coney Stand. In other words, baseball parks are no longer&nbsp;a third place for me --- they are just another commercial space trying to grab walletshare. I'll still enjoy baseball, but for a third place, it's back to  urlLink Northwest Library .  &nbsp; Then last night, rather than watching the repeat of   urlLink The Simple Life 2 ,  I retired to my room to read   urlLink The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency .  This book has nothing to do with aggregation versus disaggregation, or third places, or the death of the balanced collection, but it is a wonderful novel and I highly recommend it.

      Hey hey gang. Alane's been worried that I've been neglecting you, readers-- But no more! &nbsp;  Where I've been  I've been to Web-launch land and back again. We brought OCLC CAPCON's  urlLink new Web site  up today, on the OCLC global Web platform. As anyone who's launched a new site can tell you, it's a hair-raising process that involves a lot of coffee-drinking, head-scratching&nbsp;and beer-drinking. Usually in that order. &nbsp; It feels good to launch. And it's good to be back. &nbsp; At least we didn't have our  urlLink source code stolen ... &nbsp;

      My old friend,  urlLink Madeleine Lefebvre , head of the library at  urlLink St. Mary's U  in  urlLink Halifax , Nova Scotia, and current past president of the Canadian Library Association (CLA may not recover from having Madeleine, and then Stephen, as presidents) has started a book project now that she has all that free time away from CLA duties. (That's a joke, Madeleine)  Welcome to  urlLink LibraryRomance.com , where you can share your true stories about falling in love in a library setting. We are researching stories for a forthcoming book called The Romance of Libraries, and we'd love to hear your story.   We want to hear about both happy and sad romances, requited and unrequited. All submissions used will receive a complimentary copy of the book, to be published in 2005. Pseudonyms will be used to spare your and your loved one's blushes!   The author, a librarian, noticed how many people had met their partners in libraries, or had romantic encounters in libraries or related settings (for example, library school).  She heard a story of a couple who met in a library when studying at the same table. After they married, they bought the table from the library and now use it as their dining table. Stories are coming to light from all over, and now it's your turn!    So, all you library lovers--enter your stories! I have one...um, maybe two, well, maybe three myself...look, I've worked in libraryland a long time, OK?

      Actually the whole title of this article is "Twenty Reasons for Teacher-Librarians to Love IM" but most of the twenty reasons are relevant to any kind of librarian--or even parent.   The author is Stephan Abram, a veritable popcorn machine of ideas and energy. He's the current President of the  urlLink Canadian Library Association , the  urlLink VP of Innovation  at Sirsi, popular prognosticator at conferences, and co-author of  urlLink "Born With a Chip",  an LJ article that's been noted widely--and which obliquely mentioned the OCLC Scan.  Unfortunately, this article is not available at the Web version of  urlLink Multimedia & Internet@Schools , only in print. v.11(4) July/August 2004, p.16-18.

      The following comment was posted on  urlLink Worthwhile  July 10 in response to a question about working from home--and I was interested because of the reference to "third places".   "People were meant to share meals together. When I start to get cabin fever I instant message someone until I find one or more people that are hungry.  Another great thing is to tell people that although you are working, they are free to stop by anytime. While at the time it can feel like they ruining your productivity, these are the kind of disruptions that we all need to maintain lengthier happiness.   Third places with wifi are the best . They allow you to seamlessly transfer from production to leisure at will. You can simultaneously be working and available to the public around you."   The commenter was Will Pate, a web designer and thoughtful guy. His blog is  urlLink here . The Worthwhile blog is a multi-authored blog, like this one--although I think  urlLink Tom Peters  and  urlLink David Weinburger  are way more famous than we are. You have to like a blog that has subject categories such as Passionate Work, Making a Difference and Creativity--well, *you* don't have to...but I like it.

      Interesting idea from John Blossom at  urlLink Shore Communications , a research company like  urlLink Outsell  that tracks and analyzes trends in content.  Blossom used to work at Outsell, and I like him because he said nice things about the Environmental Scan in an email to me. ;-)  "Content providers of all kinds need to think carefully about how merchandizing concepts that have been so valuable in ecommerce can pump up content usage by users who value ecommerce methods in their daily lives...Even when an item comes out on top on a search results page it's important to place it in the framework of other related content that's going to give it a rich framework for interpretation and use. Reference data, premium content, directories and other kinds of related content can help one to make more informed decisions right on the spot without having to go into further searches."  This is, to me, a different way of saying what we said in the Scan: that it is not enough to deliver just content anymore, that context must somehow come with content.  urlLink Visualization   urlLink software  is one way of  urlLink presenting   urlLink context  although it's early days for  urlLink this  as a metasearch tool for library content--needs more on-the-fly personalization, IMO. Maybe some combo of visual search techniques with Amazon-like "if you value this, you'll value that" features.

      This Associated Press item showed up in this morning's  urlLink Columbus Dispatch  and I am fascinated. NYU's  urlLink School of Continuing and Professional Studies  has a program called  urlLink Entertainment, Technology, Digital Arts and Design  and they are offering a summer camp for gamers. "The campers--all guys aged 15-20--will use the Center for Advanced Digital Application's cutting-edge equipment to learn the techniques behind best-selling masterpieces such as Doom, Quake and Madden NFL Football."  So, these are the kind of people we need to work on an information literacy interactive game to make  urlLink bibliographic instruction  as "sticky" as game-playing. If people will spend hours working on solving problems, attaining another game level, beating Tiger Woods on the virtual golf course, and getting all the tiles off the Mah Jongg board, why oh why can't we in the library profession provide a learning environment as compelling and fun? Surely clever people could build gaming environments that reward good information choices and build information literacy, in a way we'd all find more fun? Now, go eat your spinach.

      Well, I can't figure out how to edit comments so I'll just add a posting. George commented on my last post by drawing our attention to the July 7 release of the  urlLink NEA study  Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America, done on behalf of the NEA by the US Census Bureau.   The  urlLink Boston Globe  in a report on the study says: "The report found a 10 percent overall drop in literary reading -- from 56.9 percent to 46.7 percent of Americans -- since 1982. What that means is that fewer than half of Americans had read a novel, short story, play, or poem in the preceding year." And the  urlLink Washington Post  quotes the chairman of the NEA:  "'Reading at Risk' merely documents and quantifies a huge cultural transformation that most Americans have already noted -- our society's massive shift toward electronic media for entertainment and information,' said Dana Gioia, the poet who is NEA chairman, in the preface to the 60-page study."   And if you've looked at the  urlLink ARL statistics  on the precipitous drops in reference and circulation transactions over the last 10+ years, the NEA findings won't be a surprise. So, what's the core business of the library in an era of declining appetites for our traditional services?

      I was going to post on something entirely different but.....the title quote, apparently from General Eric Shinseki, Retired Chief of Staff, US Army, shows up all over the web but I came across it in a Tom Peters  urlLink interview  who has used it as an epigraph in his book  Re-imagine! Business Excellence in a Disruptive Age  and I am putting it here in response to George's post this morning.   Sheesh! Perhaps the dismal attitudes George remarks on are a factor of inexperience and idealism, and jaded, older librarians such as George and myself have seen looming irrelevance personified in libraries by poor customer service, disinterest and lack of skills in budgeting, marketing and other basics of managing large organizations, and in librarians who seem to have forgotten that libraries are for people to use and as service organizations, libraries  must  accept and adapt to what those people want in the way of information/knowledge/content delivery.   One of the reactions from an audience member in a presentation Cathy De Rosa gave on the scan was to this needlessly adversarial "Google versus libraries" notion. This nice librarian said: "Patrons may not want to use our services, but they have to.  We might not like going to the dentist, but we have to go just the same." I don't know about you all, but I find this pretty horrifying--that we collectively are so sure of the rightness and goodness of how we currently do business we will accept a place in the lives of our communities on the level of treating gum disease or having a root canal.   I really could go on for a long, long time on this because, in my personal non-OCLC sanctioned opinion, the inability or unwillingness to understand and accept the fundamental changes in user information seeking/finding/obtaining behaviour is at the core of the challenges facing our profession. I'll hold back and end with a quote from the Tom Peters interview. "But the bottom line is clear: We cannot turn back the clock. New enemies in new guises are here to stay. New technology is here to stay. New competitors are here to stay. My hope is that we can get  urlLink beyond "coping " and learn to thrive amidst the volatility of the wild and wooly, horrible and urlLink  wonderful years  to come." Right on, Tom!

      I subscribe to a couple of listservs intended for newer librarians and library school students, and it's sometimes depressing to see some of their posts. Today there was a post on nextgenlib-l tearing apart the  urlLink "Ten Things Google Has Found to Be True."  It's basically an attack on Google because it makes money, provides information quickly, and is governed by how people use it. Another post in the same digest rails against libraries trying to learn anything from the private sector about customer service. Depressing.  It's almost funny to read these lists, because a lot of the posts focus on kvetching that older librarians with their old fashioned ideas (like me, I guess) won't get out of the way and allow the younger generation to lead us right back to the 1950s. *sigh*

      One of OCLC's corporate librarians, Larry Olszewski, ferreted out  urlLink this report  for me. You'll recall the Scan includes a short piece on e-learning in the  urlLink Research and Learning Landscape . We suggested that e-learning could be a disruptive technology in education. This new study from University of Pennsylvania researchers, Robert Zemsky and William F. Massey, doesn't exactly turn our assumption upside-down but does suggest e-learning as it is conceived currently is a solution for problem that doesn't exist--or isn't acknowledged. I haven't read the whole report yet (76 pages) but the summary suggests it will be intriguing. I'll quote a bit:  "If we build it they will come--not so. The kids will take to e-learning like ducks to water--not quite. E-learning will force a change in the way we teach--not by a long shot. The hard fact is that e-learning took off before people really knew how to use it."

      Today's title comes from the article  urlLink ARL Statistics 2001-02: Research Library Trends . Maybe it's just me (Alane....by the way, where are my co-bloggers? George? Alice?) but I found that a very amusing heading...what are trends if not continuing? What would a  urlLink dead trend  be called? History?   OK...where were we before the blogless, unconnected weekend? (This consisted of much driving to my husband's cousin's wedding in  urlLink upper state NY , home again to spend a day with one of my sisters and her family en route home to Ontario after a visit to Kentucky's  urlLink Mammoth Cave National Park , entertain, and catch up on gardening which must include a trip to the garden store to buy even more stuff to put in the ground)  We were at ALA. Cathy De Rosa and I led a session on Sunday July 25th called "Thinking out Loud" that was a kind of follow-up to the big overview sessions we do. We wanted to hear from people not talk at them--although some attendees clearly were expecting the big overview. It was--for me and Cathy anyway--a great session. We asked people to work in small groups and discuss the top issues relating to libraries, framed by the trends in the Scan. Alice was there and took notes so I'll leave it to her to fill in interesting bits I can't because I am  urlLink really bad  at note-keeping when I'm participating. I get too caught up in the discussions.   Ideas that came to the top: the library as third place (both virtually and physically); incorporate elements of gaming into tools to teach users how to search, find and obtain good quality information; use handheld devices as as way of getting to users where they are. And hasn't  urlLink Jenny the Shifted Librarian  been saying this last point for years now?  I commented a few days ago about the up-beat nature of people attending ALA. This was mirrored by our session attendees. I really see a change in attitude from a few years ago. Much more interest and enthusiasm in doing things differently and much less  urlLink doom and gloom  over the future of [pick your favorite]. It's all good!

      As you know,  urlLink Alice , (I don't have a picture of Alice)  urlLink George  and  urlLink I  were all at ALA, and we are, quite frankly, pooped and trying to dig ourselves out of the mounds of things waiting for us back at the OCLC Mother Ship in Dublin, Ohio. We have many more things to tell you about our time at ALA. The consensus of the OCLC staff attending (about 60) was that this was a very good ALA for us. Attendees were up-beat, traffic at the OCLC booth was excellent. We saw many old friends and made new ones. Hope you did too, if you were in very hot Orlando. We did speculate that the heat may have driven people inside so maybe there is method in the madness of having summer ALAs in Orlando and New Orleans, and winter ALAs in Boston and Chicago. Perhaps the  urlLink Masonic Temple of Exhibitors  pays ALA to do this.  Have a great weekend and holiday if you're reading us in the  urlLink U.S.  or  urlLink Canada .

      Well, I'm back from my vacation. I was rested and relaxed for about twenty minutes, and then I opened my e-mail:  Apres une semaine, le deluge!     I saw the earlier post about libraries and gaming and thought I'd mention that this is going to be one of the major topics of conversation at the October meeting of the OCLC Members Council. We will host a discussion of the educational implications of gaming on Sunday night, and on Monday morning, three OCLC staffers who are serious gamers themselves will provide a demonstration. And by the way, did you all see the article in  urlLink USA Today  this week about the educational uses of games?  One of my favorite stops on our cruise was Grand Cayman Island, which was just gobsmacked by Tropical Storm Charley. (A colleague of mine in Tallahassee just e-mailed me that the National Weather Service really missed an opportunity by not naming this storm Clyde, so that we would have had a one-two punch of Bonnie and Clyde.) Anyway, on Grand Cayman, I stopped at the  urlLink public library , which was quite busy at lunchtime last Monday, and which featured several PCs for public use. It's a historic building just behind the tourist strip that I happened upon quite by accident.  If I can figure out how to upload the picture I took, I'll share it with y'all.

      Meryl Streep said something interesting on the radio this morning. She was talking with  urlLink Steve Inskeep , one of the new Morning Edition hosts. (Bob Edwards, we miss you!) He was asking her about her role in the movie remake, The  urlLink Manchurian Candidate ...but slyly moved on to her personal life. It seems Meryl had a snippet of speech that got picked up from a recent political rally.  The question was roughly about how fair it was to use her star status to unduly influence voters. Her reply was terrifically un-Hollywood. She said without skipping a beat, "I just envision the world I want for my kids. And that's who I vote for. So when people ask me who I'm supporting, I tell them."  Listen to the  urlLink full story here .

      Alice has been doing yeoperson's duty, blogging away while George is perhaps still on a cruise ship somewhere, and I have been trying to catch up from my 20 hour flight home last week from D.C. to Columbus--normally a 90 minute direct flight--arriving home midday Tuesday instead of Monday evening. Yeah, so speaking of delays, Alice.....  This evening I am  urlLink here  waiting to catch a flight to  urlLink Vancouver, B.C . and then on to  urlLink Penticton, B.C. in  the Okanagan Valley, tomorrow morning for a week's vacation. Napa Valley North. I am not sure I'll be visiting any libraries but I will spend time with a few librarians. Several people from the library community in Alberta have retired to this part of B.C. and we'll get together sometime for dinner and some tall tales. We all used to belong to a society known by its initials IPALLOSH (InterProvicial Association of Library Lovers of Sheep). The genesis of the name was the Monty Python skit called  urlLink Ovine Aviation , but also appropriated the British Wool Board's mascot, Sarah. Hence, each President of IPALLOSH was referred to as the Grand Sarah, regardless of gender. Mind you, some of them did insist on being the Grand Harold (see the Ovine link).   There were a lot of library directors who put IPALLOSH on their CVs. I certainly did. Baa-aa. May the flock be with you.

      While delayed on the flight home last week, I did what any bored and disgruntled traveler does--lounge by the magazine racks and read all you can before looking conspicuously like you're not going to buy anything.  Since I'm always curious about architecture and spatial design for buildings, I picked up the August edition of  urlLink House and Garden . Not the  urlLink New Yorker ,  urlLink Time ,  urlLink Newsweek ,  urlLink This Old House  or even  urlLink Dwell . No, the cover allured me with its ocean scene of tranquility--something the Newark airport is decidedly lacking in.  What a delight when I flip to page 60 and there's a feature story on the new  urlLink Seattle Public Library !     Of course, the article centers on the innovative design and the architect, Rem Koolhaas    and Joshua Ramus of the  urlLink Office for Metropolitan Architecture . Still, the words and glossy photo spreads more than convey the central theme: libraries of the future are hip, cool and here to stay. (See the library's own  urlLink slide show .) A quote from the H & G article says it's "a state-of-the-art facility that...reinvents the library for the electronic age." (63)  They use RFID to speed book sorting and there's a  urlLink mixing chamber  (a trading floor for information) and a  urlLink book spiral , a rectangular ramp system that lets materials be displayed by their DDC classification in an interrupted flow.   The kicker comes at the end of the short article: "With economy and elegance, Koolhaas throws new light on his subject, which turns out to be not just a library, but a model of how to make a rousing noncommercial public space in an age when the shopping mall often seems America's defining building type."  Yeah! Go libraries!

      My partner in crime Val (you know, works for  urlLink LDEO at Columbia ) just sent me this clip from one of  urlLink O'Reilly Media  listservs, about a new book they have out:  urlLink We the People . It's about blogging and grassroots journalism.     We the People  For the first time, bloggers have been awarded press credentials to cover the national political conventions. That's a harbinger of bigger changes in the media landscape, according to nationally known columnist Dan Gillmor. His new book, "We the Media: Grassroots Journalism by the People, for the People," tells the story of the grassroots journalists--including bloggers--who are dismantling Big Media's monopoly on the news.  Through Internet-fueled, interactive vehicles like blogs, these readers-turned-reporters are transforming the news from a lecture to a conversation. They're publishing in real time to a worldwide audience that's eager to read their independent, unfiltered reports. And the impact of their work is just beginning to be felt by professional journalists and the newsmakers they cover. "We the Media" sheds light on this deep shift in how we make--and consume--the news.  Journalism in the 21st century will be fundamentally different from the Big Media that prevails today. "We the Media" casts light on the future of journalism, and invites us to be part of it.     Now I need to use that  urlLink xISBN bookmarklet  to find it on someone's shelf!

      I was getting ice cream the other day at a relatively new shop,  urlLink Denise's . No sooner had I selected my ice cream flavor (Tiramisu) from the  urlLink vast array of possibilities , than I spy a tattoo on the girl behind the counter.   Double Take  Now, normally a tattoo on the arm doesn't excite me. But I'm there with a colleague from OCLC, Gregor, and we both realize simultaneously that the tattoo is for the  urlLink Columbus Metropolitan Library ! And that this young, hip, ice-cream-scooping girl, all of 22, is sporting it in its full glory!   Curiosity Took Over  Of course we had to ask. "Wow, how'd you get that tattoo?" I ask. Gregor, always the bold one, cuts to the chase. "Is it  real ?" It turns out it was temporary, but she seemed surprised at all our effervescence. "Yeah, I got it from a friend who works there. It's cool. [shrug] I like it."   Moral of the story  Now, whenever someone scoffs at you, to say libraries aren't cool with the hip young crowd, tell them about the ice cream tattoo. Kids are branding themselves with your library logos!  If I only had a photo of this event...I would show you.

      Not at all, from what I've read. I've been meaning to talk about  urlLink Gaming . We started the discussion at the ALA Annual session on the E-scan...and I want to delve into it more--but for now, here's a piece that surprised me:  Online Gaming is done by Grandmas .  Here's the Wired article that a colleague, Mickey Hawk, sent around about  urlLink The Wrinkled Future of Online Gaming.   Mickey explains that,   "we can't lose sight of seniors in the online future. I certainly understand the attraction of enticing youth to our libraries to create lifelong relationships, but let's not lose them as they age.  Note that the key to 'gaming' and community in general seems to be to provide people with "a place to go" ('the third place' we've been talking about) that is exciting, yet familiar (This is one reason you see familiar offline icons used in online applications, like 'envelopes' used to communicate in e-mail applications and why it prospered as "e-mail" rather than "messaging"). Then entice them with new, but similar experiences while rewarding them for trying the new things."   Mickey went on to isolate a few key passages from the article: Yet with  82.5 million players  in the casual gaming sector,  Word Whomp  and its ilk have almost  20 times the following  of the hardcore titles like  Counter-Strike  and  EverQuest  that get all the media attention. --------  The ruling class of online gamers isn't pimply young boys, it's moms - and grandmas.  Ruth Lyon is a 66-year-old retired nurse in Honor, Michigan. Instead of watching Jeopardy or reading, she spends three or four hours a night playing euchre and bridge online with her son in California and her daughter in Ohio. And, since she lives tucked away in a cottage on a remote lake, she finds it a convenient way to make friends. "It's amazing how many older people are doing this," she says. Online games also help Anne Richards, 56, feel less alone. Confined to a wheelchair, Richards spends a lot of time inside her Florida home. "What I really like is that it's a place to find some human contact," she says.  "It gives me a place to go."  ------- " Gamer still has the connotation of technogeek . I don't think the Pogo audience even knows what a gamer is." But that's just semantics. As Hachenburg notes, "What's casual about someone spending eight hours a day playing  Word Whomp ?" ------- Getting people to start gaming is one thing; getting them to keep doing it is another. Spinning around in his chair at EA, Tahd Frentzel says one reason he thinks people hang out at Pogo longer than at other gaming sites is the "experience" it offers. Badges aren't just hokey, pixelated tchotchkes, he says;  they're sources of pride and self-esteem .  Word Whomp  offers players all the glory of an  EverQuest  win, but without the bloody mess.  Kudos to Mickey for sending this around. What are some of your experiences with gaming? Do people do it in your libraries? I'd like to put together a gaming portal where all of us who don't "game" can have a go of it. Anyone interested?

      All three of your faithful bloggers have been scattered the past week.   Alane is in DC.  George is in Chicago.  I was in  urlLink New York .  I got the best deal of the three. My husband works for  urlLink Columbia University , making gadgets for scientists at the  urlLink Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory . So while we were in the area, we took a tour of the Morningside campus.   The Library Tour  The woman who led our tour, an undergraduate ready to begin her junior year, led us to the  urlLink Butler library  with great gusto. She readily explained that the library was  the  place to be--and that anyone who is anyone at Columbia spends untold hours in the physical library  and  on their Web site.  If her presentation was any indication, I'd say academic libraries are still a big hit with students. Here are a few excerpts from the tour:   "Oh yeah, we can bring food and eat in here. It's convenient--there's a coffee bar/cafe in the basement when you get hungry. Sometimes people even order pizza to be delivered to their study carrel!"  "We use eBooks a lot--and digital collections. We're totally wireless. The entire library is a hotspot, so you can take your laptop to the stacks and still have a Web connection."  "One of my professors made us use the physical card catalog, just to make sure we all didn't think that Web searches were the only source of information."    So all of these things: unrestricted food and drink in the library, student knowledge of eBooks, and professor-mandated use of the card catalog, make me realize how far we've come since I was a lowly undergraduate. Even graduate student, when I had to schlep all my research materials to  urlLink UCL  because the book I needed could not leave the library and I could not afford to photocopy it!  With this great facility and glowing endorsement from a real life college student, I am proud to say that I am now one of the newest Columbia University library card holders with borrowing privileges. All I can say is, good thing they have a great Web site! (See the cool  urlLink Digital Scriptorium !)

      I'm in D.C but I've been spending a lot of time in the future. This afternoon was only the second time I've been out of the hotel. People, next time you attend ALA or a similar big library conference, do not complain about the number of concurrent sessions or the long days. There are about 900 attendees here at the World Future Society conference and about 900 concurrent sessions at any time--OK a small exaggeration--and the last session today ends at 10pm. There are about 20 sessions running between 8pm and 10pm.  But, interesting stuff and a most interesting assortment of people from a wide variety of sectors. I've met the Policy Director for the  urlLink Quebec Liberal Party , a senior person in the  urlLink state library of Maryland , the Director of HR at the  urlLink Ocean County Library , NJ, many "futurologist" consultants who work with clients running the gamut from Coca-Cola to the Pentagon, and some who are characters you'd have a hard time inventing, like the cybersexologist with a Phd who's a pagan--not an odd thing in her family as her dad is a druid. And I am not even going to provide a link to her web site as you have to be over 18 to go in which means it would not be wise for me to forever link an OCLC blog with it. That would be a CLM as my sister would say...a career limiting move.  So, for the next few posts I am going to share some things that I've heard or read here.     Ten Innovative Products for the Next Decade.  1. Genetaceuticals --treatments combining genetic research and pharmaceuticals. 2. Personalized computers --customized hardware and software 3. Multi-fuel automobliles -- combining electricity, natural gas and gasoline--and maybe animal fats. 4. Next-generation TV -- high-definition, wall-sized flat screens. 5. Electronic wallet -- a smart card to replace cash, keys, driver's license, medical records and so on. 6. Home health monitors -- automated analysis of your vital systems. 7. Smart maps and tracking devices -- for finding lost kids, pets or a new restaurant. 8. Smart materials -- sensors detect stress in bridges and buildings. 9. Weight control and anti-aging products -- ranging from genetic cures for baldness to nutritionally enhanced fruits and veggies. 10. Never-owned, leased-only products -- computers, refrigerators and other appliances that become obsolete quickly.
