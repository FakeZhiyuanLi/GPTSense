      Last night the cafe people had a going-away potluck for me.  B made this wonderful pineapple thing that was so so good that I spent all night wondering what it reminded me of...and I realized...it's a sweeter version of those little corn nuggest we had at the pizza place.  Yum.  Tastes much better when they aren't old off the hot bar. I was kind of pissed because saturday night nicholas went out to see that ridiculous Michael moore movie even though we'd discussed for months how ridiculous it is, and I thought we should stay home and pack...then A and he had a fight anyway.  Then last night, he wouldn't go to the potluck becuase he wanted to stay home and pack.  Melody was really pissed.  She organized everybody to get us two new suitcases for our flights.  It was really sweet.  Even Maria came in and signed my card.  Lonny was so funny, he has no idea how to babrbeque, of course, his tiny camping stove wasn't ideal.  Maybe being at the potluck will help them all accept Becky a little more...she's so nice, they just get annoyed by her laugh...maybe it'll become a cute quirk?    It sucks that I have people to miss.  It apparently takes me two years to find friends.  I just found them in Missouri when I left, and now I'm leaving here.  Hopefully, they'll still be here when I get back.  Of course, in the end, I'll always be left with just myself.

      The people from the theater finally met me for a going-away party tonight. We met at Totoro since Andrea wanted to try sushi, but was scared. It was nice. Lorna and Valerie were sweet, but distracted. They gave me flowers, which almost made me cry, except that I hate flowers. It was very sweet of them, but what am I supposed to do with them? They wilted by morning.  Andrea gave me 10000 yen, which is crazy! That's about a hundred dollars. I barely know her. I'm trying not to feel bad about it, as I remember she gave the whole cast Godiva chocolates too...she must just be an overdone gift-giver. It was really sweet. I've never even seen yen before. And she tried it all, hesitantly. (the sushi) I think she actually liked some of it.  But best of all, Raeanne and Bryan showed up! It was weird that she knows Valerie from the play, and I know Bryan from work...they weren't as picky, and ate without hesitation...why do people fear Japanese food so much? I didn't even order any sashimi. Croquettes are not scary...gyoza is not scary. Vegetable rolls are not scary...sheesh...  But...I don't think I would've gone alone the first time either.&nbsp; I'm just glad I've tried a few things before I get there.&nbsp; One of my big fears is my first grocery shopping experience.&nbsp; It's suddenly becoming apparant how little I have studied...

      As a final wah-hoo today Nicholas's parents took us to Lake Geneva.&nbsp; Being Wednesday, the rowd wasn't too bad.&nbsp; I really wanted to go swimming, but I didn't bring a suit.&nbsp; I think it was actually warm enough today (80?).&nbsp; But it was a beautiful day for a lake tour.&nbsp; Who knew that area had so much history?&nbsp; It would be fun to work in an archive there.&nbsp; Though it was&nbsp;kind of depressing to me that&nbsp;most of the people in the late 19th and early 20th century who had enough money to build there were ones who profited from the chicago fire.&nbsp; &nbsp;After that I spent all night packing.&nbsp; On the way back from Lake Geneva the sun was setting over the corn fields.&nbsp; Illinois was taunting me with the most gorgeous day it could give, so that I'll remember what I'm missing.&nbsp;  I think I'm all ready to go.&nbsp; But now I have all sorts of things to&nbsp;be worried about.&nbsp;&nbsp;The current worry is that I will lose my luggage.&nbsp; It become a big deal when most of&nbsp;your worly possessions are in three bags.&nbsp; The loss of any one is catastrophic.&nbsp; Its actually 5 am right now.&nbsp; Me, the classic dead to&nbsp;the world sleeper...is lying awake.&nbsp; I can't be like Nicholas and toss and turn awake.&nbsp; I needed to do something.&nbsp; Maybe I'll be tired&nbsp;soon.&nbsp; Unfortunately, since we have to&nbsp;drive to Ann Arbor, I'll probably sleep in the car.&nbsp; I do hate that I&nbsp;can't stay awake in the car.&nbsp; It seems unfair to Nicholas.&nbsp;Yet, I sleep every time.&nbsp;  Well, goodbye Midwest.&nbsp; See you next year.

      A flibbertygibbet, a will o' the wisp, a clown.   So the next few months should be fascinating.&nbsp; Mito high school is doing the "Mito version" of the Sound of Music.&nbsp; I watched it again yesterday and found a certain irony between&nbsp;Maria entering the Von Trapp Family home, and me entering Japanese society.&nbsp; They are writing their own script, so this should be...an interesting experience.&nbsp;

      Tonight we took the yellow convertible to Wisconsin for Ice Cream.&nbsp; I had a butterscotch sundae and thought of Dad, though he probably would have ordered strawberry.&nbsp; It's always been interesting to me that my hair blows forward in a convertable.&nbsp; I don't understand aerodynamics enough, but my instincts want to beleive my hair will blow back.&nbsp; My hair is just the wrong length right now so that it whips about frantically and it seems that every strand of hair separates in order to sting my face individually, thus creating the most impact.&nbsp; That added to the cold makes an alarmingly AWAKE ride.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's weird being homeless.&nbsp; I mean, I have lots of places I can stay, but ever since we left Ann Arbor, I have been homeless.&nbsp; My things are stored in three states, and I wander.&nbsp; Itinerant.&nbsp; I have travelled from Michigan, through Indiana, to Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin in the past few weeks.&nbsp; The corn has grown tall enough to hide me.&nbsp; But I won't see it plowed this season.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to find yen today.&nbsp; It turns out there is only one bank in Cedar Rapids where you can get foreign currency.&nbsp; 350,000 people, and there is only one bank with foreign currency.&nbsp; (US bank downtown, if you need to know).&nbsp; I have a feeling my demoninations are too large to spend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been trying to think of what to say about Iowa for my self-introductions.&nbsp; (If Iowa is indeed my home?)&nbsp; I grew up in the city, but what I love about it is the seasons.&nbsp; I think the Japanese will find a link to that, they mark the changing of the seasons with festivals and traditions like I do.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are Amercian traditions?&nbsp; I was trying to&nbsp;think of ones that go beyond my family.&nbsp; Summer Camp.&nbsp; Weddings.&nbsp; Funerals.&nbsp; Christmas.&nbsp;Prom.&nbsp; Barbeques.&nbsp; Potlucks.&nbsp; War Reinactments.&nbsp; Family Reunions.&nbsp;&nbsp;(insert food here)&nbsp;Festival.&nbsp; Trips to the Orchard.&nbsp; What things are American and what are midwestern?&nbsp; I've already gone through such a culture shock being without all&nbsp;my traditons in Ann Arbor, I can't imagine it being worse in Japan.&nbsp; I will be in a small enough place.&nbsp; I'm okay with replacing&nbsp;traditions with new traditions.&nbsp; In Ann Arbor, they just seemed to replace traditions with poverty and emptyness.&nbsp; I do not like that city.&nbsp; I think it takes me two years to begin to like a place though.&nbsp; I liked Missouri after a year and a half.&nbsp; I like Michigan once I found some&nbsp;friends.&nbsp; And then I leave... But they weren't in Ann Arbor.&nbsp; They were in Ypsi.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've completed most of the preparations for my journey.&nbsp; I have bought business suits.&nbsp; I have yen.&nbsp; I painted my mom's house.&nbsp; I gave away a carload of things to goodwill.&nbsp; I have a passport, suitcases, a visa.&nbsp; I ate at the Oxe Yolk Inn one last time...and didn't skip the pie.&nbsp; (oooh.&nbsp; Rhubarb, how I shall miss thee...) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still need to:&nbsp; Pack.&nbsp; Visit people.&nbsp; Buy Omiyage.&nbsp; Get a pin for my credit card.&nbsp; Play&nbsp;with the kitties.&nbsp; Study more Japanese (I'm so delinquent.&nbsp; I'll suffer for it later).&nbsp; and...I think that's it? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So.&nbsp; Now I just need to think about whether I am a farm girl from Iowa or a city girl from Iowa.&nbsp; (Is Iowa my home?) &nbsp; I have no offical address anymore.&nbsp; I'm homeless. &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;
