I went to my Aunt's house for supper. She can cook good. I  NO . Because that's my friend, and plus I go with Tregory. So yeeeah, that will just make the tension worse. Oh well.

      What an interesting day today. I woke up around 10 to get ready for my dentist appointment at 11:30. Yes, it takes me an hour to get ready. Haha. Tregory called, YAY, I didn't get to talk to him yesterday. Poopy. But anyways...I have no cavities, BUT I have to get braces so I can have space for my wisdom teeth. I don't want braces though. :( MAYBE I can talk my dad into getting those invisiline braces. :D Happy Me. Anyways we ate at Bumper's. Yummay. Then I mowed the front yard, took a shower, and I was going to get my haircut but they closed. My dad said that alot of stores close on Tuesday afternoon. *rolls eyes* STUPID HICK TOWN. Anyways now I think I'm going to take a nap. I'll mow the rest of the grass tomorrow maybe. Yeeah. Anyways holla. Love, Cherry

      Woot Woot. Okay lets sees here, I woke up at 9:30, from a really bad dream, which sucked. Then I mowed the grass which sucked even harder. Then I talked to Tregory for a while, then I took a shower, which makes every thing better. What a shower can do to yaz? Anyways later today I'm going to the lake and watch the perty fireworks go Boom! I hope it doesn't rain, but then again it might be fun for me...to run around in the rain. Teeheehee...everybody else will be runnin' for their lives and I'll just take my sweet lil time. So anyways I think I might wanna be a counselor or something when I grow up, or a psychiatrist, cause lots of people come to me with their problems or I just like to give advice...Teeheehee...But I might wanna be a neurologist and work on the brain. Wooohooo...Lol. Well I'll be bloggin' later tonight. Teeheehee..BLOG is a cool word. Blog Blog Blog. Okay yeah I'm hyper. Laters...Cherry<3

       Today was good. I woke up around 10:00, Tregory came over at around 12, left about 3. Then dad had to go to Grandmother's so I had to watch mom. Dad came back at around 4:30, Chris took me to Starkville. Shoe Dept. didn't have my Chuck's so I'm probably going to buy them off the internet. Should have checked at Hibbet's though. Then we went to JC Penney, I bought 2 shirts and 1 for my mommy. Then we went to Wally World. Got me a SpongeBob Rocker notebook and some Sharpies and some Candy. Wheeee...Then we went to China Garden and got food. This was my first time ever to eat with chopsticks. And I'm Asian!!! Oh well, it was fun...Tomorrow is the Fireworks Over The Water at Choctaw Lake. I'm going and gonna have fun I guess. Lol. Spuddy came over for a few to chill, he told me what Javors and Mary told him to do...>Try to go with me instead of Amber, because of what happened between him and Tregory. He said he wasn't gonna do it, because that is disrespectful and all. He thought I was going to be mad, I would only be mad if he would have tried to do it. Plus, I'm helping him and Amber "talk"...So yeeah, he wouldn't wanna upset me. Lol. Anyways Tregory left his pullover at my house, so now I'm wearing it. Teeheehee...*sniff sniff* :D  Well layder people. Hyper! Hyper! (Off Skittles n Gummi Bears) <3 Cherry <3's Tregory <3

      Okimidokies...Tregory came over and we chilled. Then about 6 me, Tregory, and my brother went to Choctaw Lake for Fireworks Over The Water, which really doesn't start till like 9:30, but they tell you to get there early. So we get there, nothing to do but walk around and eat. Tregory's cousins weren't there so he had to spend all day with me. Lucky Him. Teeheehee. Anyways then about 9:40 the fireworks started. It was very cool especially over the water, and with Tregory <3Cherry<3'sTregory<3

      My life is being sucked into the blackhole of boredom. I don't think last year was as bad as this maybe it's because I'm in Ackerman. The only person I hang out with is Tregory, or Spuddy or Mary if they come over. It's kind of sad, like 8th grade summer was off the hizzy forshizzy, I guess because I was such good friends with Krista and she lived like 5 minutes away. And I went to Oneighty alot so I could see my buddies. And now I move to this redneck hick of a town and I get excited when I go to Wal*Mart. *sigh...* Nobody gets online anymore, I guess it's because they actually have LIVES TO LIVE!!! I have like this insignificant little speck of what you call a life. I wish I had church to go to...I can't wait till I get to drive by myself to church. That'll be cool. I have a boring life. A crazy one but boring. The fact that my mom and grandmother have Alzheimer's disease doesn't really help. Adds lots of drama, but doesn't help. I'm trying to work on an Alzheimer's Disease website for mostly teens but I just haven't felt up to it. Maybe I'll work on it later tonight. My grandmother is getting worse, but at least she is old enough for the regular stereotypical alzheimer's patient, unlike momma. I really wish she didn't have it...Just irks me to see her, because I know she isn't the same. Enough about that...I think I will work on that site. Later Peeps. <3 Cherry

      Okay so last night I didn't exactly stay up...I went to bed at around 2. So I was more tired than I thought I was. I can't help that. Anyways I have nothing to do today. I wish Tregory would come over, I have nothing to do. I'm so bored...I'm playing video games. Which I haven't done for like a long long long time. Hahaha. So anyways I'm really bored....I'll be bloggin' laterz. Peace out. Cherry

      Okay lets see...last nite I really did stay up till about 7:30, then I took a sweet little nap, really by accident. Woke back up to the soothing sound of the doorbell, guess who? Aunt Faye, Uncle Joe, and The Triplets. The triple torment. They love to get into everything, ask everything, remember everything, and just be annoying. I love them to death but they are just annoying. All in my business. Lol. My room is really for teenagers, I don't think its kids approved, cause I have like stuff that they shouldn't see until they understand. Teeheehee. Like I have this picture of this dude from a magazine, CosmoG!rl, that my friend gave me and he has his shirt off, and they were like why do you have that? I'm just thinking, ONE DAY you will start liking guys. I don't remember a day I didn't like guys. In kindergarten I had a major crush on um...somebody. I think it was because I watched soap operas...anyways then after they left I went to sleep. Woke back up for cake. Happy Birthday Mommy! Then called Tregory Holla Cherry...Aka Night Owl

      So today I woke up groggily at around 10:30. I cleaned my room a little bit. Um..I mostly stayed on the computer. You know what bugs me? RACISM. STEREOTYPES. and IGNORANT PEOPLE. Those are the 3 things that if we got rid of, the world would be a better place. Anyways I got to call Tregory at like 12 or something, I don't know why. Anyways I found this nice little poem site. www.creative-poems.com Kristian told me about it. I'm glad she is finally online, now I can talk to her. She is one of my many best friends. Anyways maybe if I mow the grass, and stuff, maybe my brother just might take me shopping. I want school clothes. NOW. Poopay. <3Cherry

      Okay so I'm think of baby names. So soon you think? Heck no, I'm not having kids right now, maybe when I get OLDER. Not grown up, OLDER. I'm just thinking. I want a boy and a girl. So that way I have both. Lol  Girl Name-Paris, Chevelle, Alexandria Boy Name-Devin, Devon, Devontae  Tregory came up with Paris. :) Don't think it's like Paris Hilton or anything. I like the name Chevelle even if it is a car. People name their child's Alexis or Mercedes. So why can't I? I've always loved the name Alexandria.  I like Devin and Devon, I think I heard if off of That's So Raven. Not sure. I like Devontae because this cute little boy in my Karate class was named that. And he was just so cute even though he was much younger and shorter than me. He was just SO cute. So were his little brothers...Awww  Anyways I just got off the phone with Tregory.   Laters...Cherry...Happy...Girl...

      Something that cures boredom...Chocolate Chip Ice Cream, Usher: Confessions CD, and Dr. Mario. Isn't that just dandy? Anyways I didn't flat NOTHING today...Isn't that just the it? I woke up around 11 o'clock cause I really didn't want to mow the grass, but I should have. I wanted to go to Starkville but my brother likes being a butt and would not take me. Maybe he'll take me tomorrow?! Hopefully...Anyways...life is pretty boring for me. So um..guess that's it. Hollarz. <3Cherry<3Tregory<3

      Tregory wrote me a poem it is so sweet. I 'bout cried but I didn't because I don't cry really when I'm happy. I cry when I'm sad or really po-ed. Anyways I thought I would post it.   "Remember"  I remember our first kiss And how much I miss it Remember when I first held your hand You knew I was your man (I mean boy)    Remember me in your heart And lets never fall apart Remember how much I love you And that you love me too Remember that we're not through Not now or not ever Remember me forever Remember when you sleep My love is what you keep Remember when you lay down at night That I held you tight Tightly in my arms To keep you warm Just remember I care To lie to you is a dare Will you just remember that you'll forever be my boo If not just remember I love you...

      Well today I really thought was going to suck, but turned out kind of okay. I woke up at 6 because I had to watch my mom, while my dad and Chris went to Holmes to help register for his college schedule and what not. I'm stuck at home making sure mom doesn't wander off or get too upset or whatever. Anyways I mowed the grass too, which wasn't that hard. It was at like 8:30 in the morning. So anywho, I took a shower and then called Aunt Betty because Mom was getting a little too upset. So she came over, we went by her house got some stuff, went by the store and got some stuff. The bagboy tried to hit on me. I walked into the store and he goes "Hey" or whatever so I do the whole "Whaddup nod" thing because I have no clue who the heck he is...I don't talk to strangers. Anyways walking around the store I see Beauty (Tregory's lil niece) and his sister. Beauty is so cute and loves Tregory. Anyways I was walking out of the store and the dude goes,"Hey um...I was wondering..." And see I thought he knew my brother or something...then all of a sudden..."Would you mind if I get your number?" I said, "Uhhh...YEEEAH!?" And I thought I think Tregory would mind too....Anyways we got home made lunch and dinner, then Tregory came over about 11. Then Aunt Betty left around 11:45, and I told Tregory to leave but come back. Lol, so he did. Yay. Now I'm really tired. Oh well. This day was fun because I got out of the house. So laters. Hoola instead of Holla.

      So um...today was like any other boring day. Tregory came over, we played around. NOT LIKE THAT...we kept throwing those sticky gumball things at each other. Then after awhile we just talked. I really love spending time with him, it just makes me feel so HAPPY. Then after he left I went to sleep. He called around 4:30 or so. Then after awhile Kendra called. Then I ate. Then um..that was like it. Lol. I can't go to Jackson which sucks. I'm thinking if I really want to go I could ask Jamie if she wants me over or something. Anywho, hopefully Friday I can go to see I, Robot. Saturday I get to shop till I drop. I just hate going shopping with my brother cause he follows me around and tells me what I am buying is slutty. *rolls eyes* ANYWAYS I might buy some shorts for Band Camp cause it'll be hot and all. So yeeah. I might have to get me some real cheap tennis shoes for that, cause I don't wanna mess up my Chuck's ya know what I'm sayn. Go to Wally World or summin'. It don't matter. Anywho, I'm bored. Later. <3Cherry<3sTregory<3

      Okidokies, so today was fun. Most interesting...Tregory came over and stuff. Then I went to Fred's to get some stuff. I had 15 dollars and left with 3. Strange? I bought page 'tectors for my binder. I think I need a new binder now. I printed out all the lyrics to all the Meteora songs by Linkin Park. :) One happy camper. I haven't heard from Sharla yet, so I don't know if I'll be able to go to Jackson or not. I really don't feel up to it, but I really want to see Sharla before she leaves. She is like my sister, and I'd also see Kristian, and that is one of my sisters for real. I only seen 'em once this summer. Anyways, I'm so ready for school to start. I don't know if I'm going to act all crazy like I did at Whitten on my 2nd year, but who knows. Alot has to do with the people that go to that school. I don't like 'em. Ashley, Shirreka, Tregory, Adriano, Sam, and maybe some others are my friends. Salaste is moving, which kind of sucks. Well I'm now making pretty little band pictures. I made H.I.M. and CKY, now I'm going to do Linkin Park and a few others. Hm...who knows. Well laters. Cherry

      Today was wicked.&nbsp; I woke up early to mow the grass to make a little more money. Then I played on the computer and played Dr. Mario on SNES(Old Skool Baby) And then, Tregory called and then it stormed, and so the power went out for like 10 seconds. Then he called back. Um...then I went to bed.&nbsp; Then afterwhile he came over I was asleep. Lol, Then anyways we went to see I, Robot, which is a really good movie. I say A-. 4 1/2 Stars...Anyways that's it.&nbsp; I'm bored. I'm tired. I'm going shopping!!! Later. Love Cherry

         So yesterday, which really feels like today for me, was okay. Tregory didn't come over, which kinda sucked, but I slept late. He called me though around 12:15 and we talked till about 3 something.&nbsp; So that made up for not seeing him. I got a letter from band, band camp starts August 2. Which really sucks, but I'll be okay. Anyways I get to see I, Robot. Yayness. I'm going to wake up early tomorrow to mow the front yard, so I can get some money. Then Saturday I'm going shopping. I wonder if we can eat lunch there. I want to go to China Garden. Eating with chopsticks rocks my socks. It's fun LOL.        Anyways I've been thinking about this and this is my opinion. I think we make guys cheat. Seriously, this is what you see sometimes. A guy that has a girlfriend, then another girl comes along and wants to hook up with this guy. Then the guy is like I have a girlfriend, and then the girl says, So? What's that got to do? I just think that is plain nutty. Cause I think every girl wants a trustworthy boyfriend and honest one, so when you do that, you screw with their train of thought. Guys are simple yet complex. Anyways if you make that dude cheat on his girlfriend with you, what makes you think he won't just cheat on you to? Seriously now. I've seen this posted on gurl.com message boards, and it just makes me sick. I know Tregory won't do anything to hurt me or meant to at least. (You know guys) I'm just helplessly, completely, undeniabley, in love with the boy. We've already talked about marriage and kids. I mean seriously, I really do not think will get married, but that would be cool. I just want this to last as long as possible. It's been 3 months and 3 weeks and 3 days. HAHA, thats funny. Anyways...I LOVE HIM!!!! Teeheehee...can't wait to see him tomorrow.      Love Cherry Loves Tregory Love

      I love Jervon Tregory Esters. &nbsp; Well today was okay. I basically did nothing. I got to drive today, which was fun, I did eh-okay. Then I went to church, which was good. Now I'm listening to my H.I.M. CD.&nbsp; I think next time I'm going to get Breaking Benjamin. Costs 13.99 at Sam Goody. And then maybe CKY, but I have most of the songs burnt on CD's. Lol. Talked to Tregory today, I'm happy. I wish I could just tell him how I felt. I wrote a poem, it sucks, but tells exactly how I feel I guess.... &nbsp; Words don't express enough for me When I try to tell you how I feel It just comes to these 3 words: I Love You I don't know any other way to let you know this Except stay by your side and always be true Do you really know how much you mean to me? I think about you all the time I just can't get you off my mind I wish I could tell you everything I feel But all it comes down to is... I LOVE YOU &nbsp; I believe I started to cry. And that's never really happened before, I've never cried over a boy, and especially for no good reason, or is that a good reason? Anyways *sigh* And because I'm 15, it just scares the living bageeba's out of me, I might get hurt. But that's just a chance I'll have to take, right? RIGHT!!! &nbsp; Later, Cherry &nbsp; I Love Tregory 4 Ever N Alwayz....3/22/04

      Okidokies, today was a good day for me. Dad woke me up early saying I needed to help clean up Grandmother's yard, because yesterday the storm blew in alot of sticks and stuff. So me and Chris helped picked them up. I got $20 for it. Yay. Then after that we went to Wally World. I bought me 2 binders, Spongebob Rocker notebook, and white out. Lol, I'm going to get more school supplies later. Then after that we went to Sam Goody. I bought me H.I.M.'s cd: Razorblade Romance. It's really good. Then we went to JC Penney. I bought me some jeans, they fit really good, and they are long. Just how I like them. Then I bought a black shirt and it has a cherry on it. I got a Snoopy shirt, it looks old skool like. I also got me a blue shirt with some stuff on it. Anyways after that I took a nap. Then Tregory called me. Happy Me. We are going on 4 months, which is my longest relationship at all. I'm so happy. I'm going to buy him some boxers for his birthday, and then give him like $20. Right now I'm watching Star Wars Epi II, Hayden Christensen looks good in this movie. LoL. Samuel L. Jackson, is one of my favorite actors. Fav Actors: Samuel L. Jackson, Denzel Washington, Richard Gere, George Clooney...Fav Actresses: Julia Roberts, Halle Berry, Uma Thurman, I don't have that many actresses. Lol, Anyways I don't know what else to say, but I just feel like blogging. It's fun. I don't want to go to Band Camp, I don't want to see some people, and I don't want to wake up early. At least I'll have something to do. I haven't played my clarinet for awhile, so I really suck. Poopy. I can't wait till school starts, these are the classes I am going to take. Spanish, Family Dynamics, Band, Geometry, Chemistry, English II, and History. Adriano's mom teaches spanish through fibro-net. "Hola! Como Estas?" Then Mrs. Moncreif teaches Family Dy. I think. Mr. Mac teaches band. I don't know if he'll let us play the good&nbsp;music. I don't know who will teach me Geometry, because Mrs. Burton left to Holmes. :( She was one of my favorites teachers. Then I don't know who teache Chemistry...Its not Mrs. Nail. She was cool. Then English II, might be Mrs. Reed, the evil teacher...And History. I don't know. Some teachers left...Anywho, I don't know where we will have the football games, because they tore up the field and everything. I'm definately going to the basketball games because Tregory is on the team. :)&nbsp; Happy Me. Yes Yes Yes. Happy me. Tomorrow I'm going to church, so yay. I haven't been to church for a few weeks cause my ride has been in Florida.&nbsp;Lol, Anyways my brother wants me to get off, so later.

       So I woke up at 9 today to watch my mom because my dad had to go out and help Grandmother. Then at like 10:30 Tregory came over. :) I was looking at him, like I always do, but I noticed he looks alot like Usher. Or Usher looks alot like him. LOL, I wonder if he has the body of Usher?...Something we'll have to find out later.  ANYWAYS  then after he left I went to Fred's, and um...then slept from 5 to 6. After supper slept until 8. I'm still tired. *Yawn* Oh, Tregory didn't bring his dog over here, because he couldn't get one cause his little brothe got the last one. :( And I wanted to name it. PooP. Well Sharla called today, it's her last day, she is moving to Arkansas. :( I'm so bored. Well um...later.      I love Tregory 4 Ever N Always

        Okay well, Tregory came over today.  :) Um...Then after he left I fell asleep.   Then woke up for supper.   Watched WWE RAW.   Called Tregory.   He kind of made me mad,   so I quit talking,   but he wouldn't talk because I wasn't,   and I don't think he quite knew why I was mad,   but anyways I hung up cause nobody was talking,   but asked first, "What are you doing?"   So I thought he might had fallen asleep.   Then he called back,   after like 5 minutes,   he said I'll call ya back in a few minutes.   So yeeeah, he hasn't called back yet,      and I don't think he is,    which is pissin' me off.   But I'm sure he has a good reason.   Anyways I really want to see him  ...*sigh* I hate to love,    really I do.

       I am deciding on my future career. It seems like people with problems seem to gravitate towards me, I'm not saying my friends are problems, I'm just saying they seem to come to me with help. I'm thinking of becoming a psychiatrist or psychologist, but I don't want to start analyzing my family and friends. And they say the highest suicide rate is caused by psychiatrists, because they hear all those problems. But maybe a counselor, they aren't as bad? Or maybe just a sociologist? Study human behavior. I really like listening to peoples problems I don't know why....It's strange.    Anyways I've talked to Tregory almost all frikkin' day. YAY. Last night he said he would call but he didn't he fell asleep. He's getting bad at that. I hate it when all those "what if's" go through your head...BLACH.   well later.

       I believe my insecurities are stupid. Stupid and no good. I talked to Tregory today. :) And I think I trust him with everything I have, and that may be a stupid gamble, but I'll take it. I have to understand that my past relationship was the PAST and the present is a gift to me, especially because it's not my past! Is that confusing? Anywho, I was talking to him awhile go and this is like the conversation or close to it. Me: "Have you thought of a boys name yet?"    Him: "No." Me: "Why?" (I'm always asking Why because I like too.) Him: "Because I haven't been thinking about it." Me: "Why?"   Him: "Because what I am thinking about is more important, I'm thinking about the person I love." Me: "Ohhh..." Him: "Do you know who that is?"   Me: "No..." Him: "You don't know...?" Me: "It could be your mom..."    &nbsp;  Okay and then we got on a whole different subject. Anyways Saturday, hopefully we can go see Catwoman. Yay! Today he is supposed to come over...Yes!!! I    I love Tregory.   Yes I do.   No question about that.   My trust in him is 100%.   Yes it is.   If I get hurt. Oh dam* well, I'll get over it. Won't I?    &nbsp;  Love Cherry Loving Tregory Love

      Okay I just need to talk. For the last few days I guess, me and Tregory just don't seem to have the same phone conversations. They are, well, boring. He doesn't talk like he used to. Is it me or am I just boring? Maybe it's just a phase...maybe our "spark" is dying? I mean it doesn't really happen when we are together, because well durh, we're together. I just wish I wasn't so boring...or what not. I don't know...I think I'm just over reacting. Yeah thats it.

        So I just now recently thought about this...I use this mostly to talk about Tregory. Hrmm...I don't know why...Anyways yesterday I went hiking up Little Mountain. Then I went to French Camp and looked at all the historical stuff. Then ate at French Camp's park and played. Reminded me so much of recess as a little kid. Then after that we went to Ackerman's park and raced around the track. I made it 2nd. Then me and Kristina played batmitton&nbsp;against Adriano and Jacqui, we won. Champs!! Then after that we went to Kristina's house and stuff. It was lots of fun. Then we went to church. Then today Tregory came over. :) Happy Cherry. Then after that me and my dad drove around Ackerman. I'm really getting better. I didn't stall as much. Hehehe...

      Okay yesterday I posted but my computer decided to make me mad so this is the post from my LiveJournal.  Okay, Yesterday(July 21) was wayyy awesome. I woke up at 6:30 got ready for the hike. They picked me up around 8:00. Then we went to Little Mountain. It was a nice day for a walk too. I got my exercise. The whole time I was thinking about Tregory. =D Then after that we went to French Camp, got there at like 10 something I guess. Then we walked around the historical places, it was very interesting, I think my mom would like it because she likes that kind of stuff, but I don't know if she could take it. We went to the little gift shop thing, it was awesome. Then after that, we went to the French Camp park and ate and played on the Merry-Go-Round and the swings and the zip cord. It was like recess. Then after all that we went to Ackerman park. Me and Christina played batmitton(Sp?) and we kept winning. Yay. We rock. We also raced around the "track". I got 2nd place but that's just cause I was getting tired. Maybe next time, eh? Then after that we went to Kristina's and Jacqui's house. I got to see their kittens and we played Speed and War (Card Games). After that we had hamburgers. They took me home to take a shower and change. And then I went to church. I had fun. Did you have fun? Anyways then today I did nothing. Tregory came over. Really happy!!! And then I got to practice driving. I saw Derek, Tregory's cousin, and I saw Cortez and Cortez. Lol Then I went to sleep after that. Saturday I am going shopping with Ashley and Monday after band camp I'm going shopping. Yayness! We're going to have lots of fun. Wheeee!!! I Love To Shop. I just wish I had a job for money. Yameen? Anyways I get my contacts the day before school starts. I'm happy. I don't know when I'm going to get my hair cut. Just whenever...Blah...Well later.Love Cherry Loving Tregory Love  Anyways now yesterday I didn't do much but e-mail Ashley and see Tregory. I drove around a bit. I think I'm getting kind of better. Hm...Anyways then today I saw Tregory. :) Happy Me. Tomorrow I'm going shopping with Ashley! Woot! If I mow the grass I get $10, and maybe my dad will fork over $20 more. So then I'll have $30 to go shopping with. Cause you know these days you can't buy anything good with $20. Lol, Anyways I'm off. Later. Love Cherry

      So I don't feel like retyping what I did...I'll do it the lazy way. LiveJournal. So yesterday I went shopping with Ashley, they came and picked me up at around 3. We headed to Starkville and went to JC Penney to meet up with her aunt and cousin who is 10 and talkative. Anyways we went their, she bought a lot of stuff, and I got 1 black shirt that says Pixie with Tinkerbell on the front and back. REALLY CUTE. Then we headed to Columbus and went into Burlington Shoe store, and looked for Ashley some shoes. I already bought mine. She didn't find anything and then we went to the mall. Went into Shoe Dept. she found some cute blue and yellow sketchers. I liked the pink and black though. ^_^ Then after that we went into Sears. I bought another shirt that says DOTS like the candy. Then we went to Claire's I bought me a Happy Bunny Pillow and a ring that has dice in it. SO CUTE. Ashley bought me a pair of earrings for my bday. (April 30) Then we went into 4ever Young which didn't have much. Then after that we went to Pizza Hut, and ate. Yum. Then we went to McRae's, which I think I LOVE!!! They had the most cutest shirts and pants. It was alot like JC Penney 'cept with more variety and better sales. I bought a shirt on the sales rack for 1.99 ROCKIN!!! Then I bought this blue and baby blue cap. Matches my chuck's. Big Pimpin. Anyways I had lots of fun. We were going to go bowling but her little cousin aggravated the heck out of his momma so we couldn't go. Pooey. Oh well.  >>today tregory came over. woohoo. we played basketball. i won. cause i played by my rules (lots of fouling). hehehe, anyways i've seen the biggest trend this year is Pink and Black. and it doesn't have to be PUNK its on EVERYTHING!!! i swear...some pink and black is okay but i see it everywhere. ugh. and also "vintage" shirts that have stuff on 'em. Like DOTS candy or CHARMS suckers. yameen? they are cute but its such a trend. BLAH...anyways tomorrow is band camp. woohoo lucky me.

      Today was okay. I went to band camp like usual. At break Tregory was at the park so he came over to see me. I told him last night he was scared to come up there, I just wanted him to come and see me since I haven't seen him in 3 days. Heheh, Sneaky. Band was okay, we got alot of stuff accomplished but Mr. Mac got to see our bad side, cause alot of people were talking. Then after band Tregory was still there. Yay. And I went home for lunch. Then Ashley called me and told me we weren't having practice. So yay. After that I went back to the band hall and got my instrument. Then I went to Piggly Wiggly. I'm never going there again. I know I said that before but now I'm for real. I'm buying a cake for my dad so I'm looking at cake mixes. (Did you know they make caramel cake mix?) This dude walks by and says..Dude: Hey How Ya Doing?Me: Um..Okay?Dude: Baking a cake?Me: Uh..Yeah? *Stupid! Why else would I be in the cake mix section.*Dude: Gonna bake me one?Me: Uh..NO!? (I should have said HELL FUCKING NO)Dude: Aw, man.Perverts must crowd around Piggly Wiggly or something. Ugh Anyways I'm so happy I got to see Tregory. Let me tell you my dream.Okay I don't really like this girl Jackie because she's kind of nosy and loud but I'm cool with her. Anyways last night I had a dream I was stabbing her with a fork. Weird huh? Not stabbing her in the heart or nothing just on her hand because she had something of mine. I guess I don't like her because she used to go with Tregory in the 8th grade, even though I wasn't here. Anyways it was kind of cool. Haha. Well thats my day. Today is my dad's birthday. Yay!!Later Love, Cherry I LOVE TREGORY!!!
