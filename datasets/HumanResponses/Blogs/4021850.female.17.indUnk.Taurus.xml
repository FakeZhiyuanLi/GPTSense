       Anyone who view my diary, u guys can leave any comments if you guys want~!   This is my first diary...&nbsp;In this diary , i wanna write something different from my xanga~!  Today is Saturday, i will go&nbsp;to vietnam beef noodles restaurant have a lunch. Then , i will go to Library... STUDY STUDY STUDY... My&nbsp;goal is to get an average A... HOpe i will do well in the last test...   Back to single again... Single is good...&nbsp;Sentiment is hard to express the feelingz... It's easy come and easy go...&nbsp;When it's gone, it's gone... Past was past, don't think back...&nbsp;It didn't have "Miracle" in this world. Don't have too much hope that&nbsp;"he" will come back... He is so dump... don't think about ppl's feeling, just do what he wanna do... SO SELFISH... Maybe i am the one who is the most selfish... After "he" and I had a year relationship, from begining to the end. At the end of love, He makes me think "Love"&nbsp;will make me confused, complicated and no confidence... Who can give me back the conifidence of LOVE?????????

       Kevin, how can you do that to me? i mean........ i have already gave you love through a year and when we broke up, u just ......... ignore me..... how come? what did i do wrong with u, huh?After we broke up , i REALLY INSANE... I think the guys who love or like me just like my apperence not my heart... but actually... they really like my heart. But I don't know why, I still..... miss you... non-stop thinking about u... I really can't adapt a new love, I really no confidence on it. My best friends told me that i must get over it... I will... I hope.....    &nbsp;  Johnny, I really felt sorry for you... i shouldn't start with u in the beginning... I'm so sorry... You and your friends must hate me a lot... i know... but i really really so confused..... I should forget about him anymore... sorry~

       給我一團熊火 試煉我 證明我這麼狠狠愛過    期望不多 只要得到過 你身旁 那寶座    給我一場洪水 冷靜我 眼淚太多已匯聚成河    力竭聲嘶請你喜歡我 什麼事都做過 都不能感動你麼    * 原來暫時共你沒緣份 來年先會變得更合襯    頑石哪天變黃金 我可以等 融合二人是哪樣成份    但願虔誠能顯得吸引 用五十年溶化你 成就 金禧一吻 *    不夠激情仍可靠耐性 對付你的冷酷及無情    沉默假使都算種本領 我一定 最安靜    深信忠誠遲會獲勝 那份固執終於都會被尊敬    如煉金般等你先轉性 除非遺失人性 怎可能一直結冰    頭白了 還在等 情人預約在黃昏     原來暫時共你沒緣份 來年先會變得更合襯  期待再苦再難堪 我都會忍 談情十年未晚不怕等  渡日如年仍覺得興奮 若最後能溶化你 何用 心急手震

        Last night, I was waiting someone to online msn to talk with me. Because he said he will be back online in 5 minutes... Then, I wait.........i wait....... and i wait...... at last, i can't wait him to online then i went to bed at 12:15pm.  This morning, I arrived school at 7:55am. I arrived there 5 minutes early than normal time..... which means I have to arrive school that early too......... I usually late 1 minute to school. Today, the teacher, Mr. Steptenson, taught us a lot of stuffs that made me so confused. I hope when i studied it, i will understand it.&nbsp;During class's break, my friend who is from Hong Kong. He&nbsp;tricks me and make me to buy him candies......ai........ i won't get his trick anymore....... Then, I saw Justin has a yummy chips so i bought it. Yummy....... Today most of my classmates slept in class... maybe they didn't sleep well last night. I almost want to fell asleep too because i am not feeling well today. After class, I went to school Library to research my project's stuff. And lawrence saw I got lots of information then he copied my research...urgh...... hope his project won't be similar as mine. After that, I went to Pho's beef noodles restaurant by myself. I ordered my favourite dishes which is "Seafood Dry Noodles". Next time,&nbsp;I must bring my own lunch because that will make me save money and time. Then I went to Langley Library to study. I ate and studied alone, I really want to have a partner or friends to study with me... I don't wanna be alone. JAMIE, BE INDEPENDENT AND MATURE... OK? Tomorrow i will have a quiz and a test, God bless me and&nbsp; hope i will&nbsp;get a better mark to upgrade my average too~!

       My host mom got a week off so i usually see her at home~^^ Today i did bad in the quiz, 11 out of 15... so bad... my average won't upgrade anything... "Yellow sunshine" wants "FBI" to exchange the average... haahaa~!IMPOSSIBLE~! Hmm..... today test i did half of it, tomorrow will be continue... I hope i will do well on it... Today at school, Tristan and Kevin keep picking on me... that's ok... I always tricked by anyone... hmm... Today quiz, I am not satisfied and Tristan saw that i got  NO SMILE  on my face... then he used two fingers to put on his face and expand his both side of his lips which mean he remind me to   SMILE~!   Even I did bad on my test, just think i will do good in the next test~!I did tell everyone I studied ,actually I didn't study... I was in the internet all the time... In Library, I used my Library card to go in internet too... didn't study much...    JAMIE...URGH...STUDY, PLEASE...    I didn't go to Library after school because no one are gonna be there... and i usually won't do anything... so stay home rather than go there and do nothing... From now on, I must be on diet... because i discover that i am getting fat~!   Oh~! We must hand in the Chemistry Project on Thursday... I will start it tonight~!     &nbsp;  Below those two lyrics are sooooooooooooooooooooo good~^^

       I could stay awake just to hear you breathing, Watch you smile while you are sleeping, While you are far away and dreaming, I could spend my life in this sweet surrender, I could stay lost in this moment forever, Where a moment spent with you is a moment I treasure,  I don't want to close my eyes, I don't want to fall asleep, Cause I miss you baby, And I don't want to miss a thing, Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream will never do, I still miss you baby and I don't want to miss a thing  Lying close to you feeling your heart beating, And I wondering what you are dreaming, Wondering if it's me you are seeing, Then I kiss your eyes and thank god we're together, I just want to stay with you in this moment forever and forever forever  And I don't want to miss one smile, I don't want to miss one kiss, I just want to be with you right here with you, Just like this, I just want to hold you close, I feel your heart so close to mine And just stay here in this moment,For all of the rest of time

       If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?   If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?   If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call   If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all    &nbsp;  I never know what the future brings    But I know you are here with me now   We'll make it through    And I hope you are the one I share my life with    &nbsp;  I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand   If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?   Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?    &nbsp;  If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?   If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?   If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?   If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?    &nbsp;  I don't know why you're so far away    But I know that this much is true   We'll make it through    And I hope you are the one I share my life with   And I wish that you could be the one I die with   And I pray in you're the one I build my home with   I&nbsp;hope I love you all my life    &nbsp;  I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand   If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am   Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?   'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away   And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today'   'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right   And though I can't be with you tonight   And know my heart is by your side'

       This morning, I saw a spider walked under my bed.........ahhhhh......... hope it will be dead and no babies there.......thanks god.......Finally, I have done my project this morning. Then, we have another small project coming up... OH, MY GOD~! another one again?! Actually, I did it in the Library today~^^ I totally don't understand what the teacher taught us today... So confused... I will try to figure out what was the teacher talked about in the text book tonight. Before break, the teacher taught a lot, made me so muddle... After the break, we went to Library to research our small project and did our assignment. During that time, Kevin was so annoying... He kept bothering me and got my hat off... I really don't know what he was thinking... I know u guys like to bully me and I know I am feeble. I didn't mad at you guys just don't always bully me all the time, especially during the class... I did my homework so slow, Tristan had finished his homework already... I am stupid, I can't understand stuffs quickly... Tristan teaches me all the time and I always can't get it immediately... Sorry, Tristan... forgive my clumsy brain...&nbsp; I should change my study attitude too because I learnt things really slow... ai................     &nbsp;   Is that lovers can't back to real friends after all? Is that true?    If so,&nbsp;I won't choose them to be my lovers rather than to be a friend.    Even that I really like the guy, i will treat him as a real good friend.

       Today everyone got mad and it was unlucky day too~! First , when i woke up my neck was so sore, i think i didn't sleep probably~! Last night, I dreamed a guy and I were talked a lot, I didn't know what we were talking about then my dream awake... I can't see the guy's face in my dream... so weird.....maybe that's my future husband... haahaa~! I did my quiz and did it not bad... but something happened here... One of my classmates loved to cheated in his tests and quizs, unfortunatly, I got his quiz which means i had to check his answers... well, i afraid he will scolded me that why i don't correct his answer when it was wrong. So, i just gave him to correct it by himself. Then, Kevin was mad at me because he thought i shouldn't do that. Most of my classmates said i was so dumb to do that~! I won't do that anymore and I won't check his quizes or tests anymore........At last, Kevin forgive me... thanks...kevin... Our Chemistry teacher, Mr.Stephenson was so mad today too because he didn't like any of his students slept in his class. And one student was slept in class so Mr.Stephenson told him to get out of the class. Poor him~>     Happy Birthday to Stanley and Carol(host mom)~!   Best wishes for you guys~!

       一朵雲能載多少思念的寄托 再忽然相遇街頭   當我們擦身而過 那短短一秒鐘 都明白 什麼都變了   一轉身誰能把感慨拋在腦後 在事過境遷以後   這段情就算曾經 刻骨且銘心過 過去了 又改變什麼   地球它又 公轉了幾周了   (濃情愛戀 都已陌生了)    我不難過 甚至真心希望你能幸福    當我瞭解你只能活在記憶裡頭      我不恨你了     甚至原諒你的殘酷理由        當我瞭解不愛了      連回憶 都是負荷      我不難過 甚至真心希望你能幸福    當我瞭解你只能活在記憶裡頭 我不恨你了   甚至感謝這樣不期而遇    當我從你眼中發現 我已是      陌生人了       我已是 陌生人了

       I   went to downtown Vancouver with homestay this morning. Joanne and Ingrid were together with us too. First we went to " Queen Elizabeth park" to view the various flowers. And we took few pictures there too. Then we went to the shade of a tree to have our lunch picnic. I had a ham and cheese sandwich, orange juice, a plum and a peach. Healthy food, huh?Then we went to the city of Vancouver which was a lot of Asian people. We had fun in the window shopping of Robson street. After that, We went home at 4:00pm. We have no school tomorrow, yeah~! well, tomorrow is my study day so nothing to be happy... haahaa~!      I was in a bad mood today... Maybe I will go to Australia after a year... I miss Canada... ai...... In order to my future, I have to study there...       I have to completely focus in English~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       I have three things to say...      1) 見到你個msn名,我個心都涼哂...因為你寫住"I am lonely"哈哈~!真係開心...實係冇女要你啦~      2) Aymi and my friendship is over... well, i wanna say that i know this event because I did wrong thing again... :'( but i wanna say that Jin and I are nothing... I just forget to tell u that i went to his house because I was waiting for your phone call~I know i said sorry means nothing because I can't have your forgiveness again... Library was close and I had no where to go... Outside was sooooooo hot so i just ask him can i come over...      3)宜家除左我家人相信我之外,仲有一位最好最好既朋友...mallory~當我做錯事既時候,你會寬恕我...支持我...我已經好比心機改緊我d缺點架啦...希望終有一日更多人會信任我...   and one more thing... We still miss our true love who don't love us anymore...ai... Hope one day they will understand us... right? We must get over it........... how?huh?

       Get a load of me,   Get a load of you,   Walking down the street   And I hardly know you   It's just like we were meant to be      Holding hands with you,   When we're out at night,   Got a girlfriend   You say it isn't right,   And I've got someone waiting too.      what if this is just the beginning   We're already wet and we're gonna go swimming      Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you   Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you   Its inevitable... it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it   So tell me...   Why can't I breathe whenever i think about you      Isn't this the best part of breaking up   Finding someone else you can't get enough of   Someone who wants to be with you too      Its an itch we know we are gonna scratch    Gonna take a while for this egg to hatch   But wouldn't it be beautiful?      Here we go we're at the beginning    we haven't fucked yet, but my head's spinning      Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you   Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you   It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it   So tell me   Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you      High enough for you to make me wonder   Where it's goin'High enough for you to pull me under   Somethin's growin'   Out of this that we can control   Baby I am dyin'      Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you   Why can't I speak whenever talk about you      Whenever i think about you

       唉..........又見到你個msn名寫住 "Hope u will feel me some day" ,到宜家你都未有女仔要你...難道這是上天的安排?你越想找新的女朋友,上天就唔比你? 是一件好事還是一件壞事呢?有男仔追我,我都一一拒絕or同佢一齊一個星期...為什麼我偏偏要選擇你?但你又不領情...唉......   Lots of memeries appear on my head...recall.........recall........recall.......      如果你突然打了個噴嚏 那一定就是我在想你   常常想 你說的話是不是別有用心 明明很想相信   卻又忍不住懷疑... 在你的心裡 我是否就是唯一?   愛 就是有我常煩著你...為何我最近常常打噴嚏, 這是不是代表你也想著我呢?      你甜蜜的折磨 沒想過會這麼痛   沒有開始沒有分手沒有愛你沒有愛我   你說最好能 只當朋友 這樣感情會更長久       喜歡你, 關心你, 著緊你... 才留意你一一的東西...   Mallory, I read your xanga n blogspot almost everyday...   U make me feel u still have problems unsolved... i am worried...

       It's amazing how you Can speak right to my heart Without saying a word You can light up the dark Try as I may I could never explain What I hear when you don't say a thing The smile on your face Let's me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes Saying you'll never leave me A touch of your hand Says you'll catch me if ever I fall Yeah, you say it best When you say nothing at all All day long I can hear People talking out loud But when you hold me near You drown out the crowd Old Mr. Webster could never define What's being said between your heart and mine The smile on your face Lets me know that you need me There's a truth in you eyes Saying you'll never leave me A touch of your hand Says you'll catch me If ever I fall Yeah, you say it best When you say nothing at all The smile on your face Lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes Saying you'll never leave me A touch of your hand says you'll catch me If ever I fall Yeah, you say it best When you say nothing at all

       從心底裡拿走一個人很痛很難.........   請 收起這份牽掛 無能力接收下  沒空位擺放簇新的愛情   從來未相識...已不在，這個人極其實在，卻像個虛構角色，　   莫非今生原定陪我來..卻去了錯誤時代？！     Suffering..............     T0 : Winnie the pooh.......   長年住在我家 小小一個家 小熊像不說話     日夕亦共伴上學上路 上盡也在秘密對話    過去這戴眼鏡少女一針一針去 細緻親手製造你    每次我洩氣 垂頭哭泣中多得你可一起緊皺著眉    最愛每晚與你分析他一切 我說多少有運氣    你或有點生氣 擔心不可再去分半張被    常熊抱 燈熄了開心傷心都細訴    黃澄澄 漆黑中起舞當世界睡了 定會在暗中給我去禱告    你令我有福氣 天天督促我要比昨天美

       Last night, i chatted with Ring who was my HOng kong's friend. She and I haven't chatted for ages, I miss her very much... and i miss my sweet home~ :'( serious homesick... This morning was rainning, I got all wet even i had my umbrella...urgh...Today i got tons of homework and tests because summer school still have three days to go. I caught the bus beside my school and it would be arriving there at 12:20pm only 5 mins later after my school at 12:15pm. I rushed to the bus stop, fortunately the bus was waiting for me too. I went to "Save on food" and bought my commodities. Then, I went to Library for internet...about 15 mins later, I walked home. It was a far far way to home and I walked and sweated... Those items were so heavy too...ai.......Finally, I got home... Tomorrow I will go to Library with Sherry for the Chemistry project...

       Nothing special for Today... My mood same as the weather today... Cloudy and rainy~ I went to Library at 5 today and start my small Chemistry Project... I will be so busy in these two days because summer school is gonna over soon... My average.................ai..............don't wanna mention it... Despress for today~ :'( After I left Library, I went to coffee shop to have my Mocha and cheese cake. I don't know why the mocha tasted bitter. I usually drink Mocha was tasted sweet... Mybe it was because I got a bad mood today.      Why god has to give me that sadness and it took me for a long time in this sadness...   When will it gone, when will i get rid of it?   I am really suffering in these few months...please..... don't play me... I don't want to have this game...

       Today was the last day of summer school~ I miss the days that we were in the same class together~! 好不捨得你們喔~~~Hope we can still keep in touch~! Well, I was in a bad mood again~! I screwed up the Final Exam~! 50 out of 80~! Most of my classmates got 60 sth out of 80~ I tried my best to do my final and I got that marks, I felt i was so useless... Everytime I thought i would do well on the test. At last, it made me disappointed...This time, I can't control my sentiment... I cried~ Thanks Tristan, Sherry and Kevin to comfort me... 謝謝你今天給我一個肩膀~  留意 : 我不是一個愛哭鬼~       我的運氣指數不停地下降.....................no mood in these few days...   完完全全沒感覺到我在放暑假........ i can't go back to HK... :'(

       我今天整天都一直看愛情小說............共二百三十四頁...一氣呵成,讀完它~    > 張小嫻 著作    這一本小說不是寫的很幸福, 而是寫的全是關於離別.........(很適合我現在的狀況)   以下的字句, 從這本書學回來的..........   1) 愛一個人, 應該包括讓他追尋自己的理想.   2) 相隔那麼遠, 不怕失去嗎? 愛情應該是擁有的.    3) 愛情, 就是美在無法擁有.   4) 女人往往比男人容易適應環境.   5) "祝你永遠不要悲傷."   6) "珍惜眼前人"   7) "別離是為了重聚"   8) 從前的別離, 是為了國家. 為了國家,放下兒女私情.   9) 今天的別離, 首先犧牲的, 也是兒女私情.   10) 兒女私情原來從不偉大, 敵不過別離.   11) 對一個人的懸念, 不一定是曾經有欲.   12) 單單是愛, 可以比欲去得更深更遠.   13) 只有愛和悲傷可以令一個人去到最高境界而做出他們的創作.   14) 我們之間的愛從不平等, 從不害怕有一天會失去他.   15) 如果不害怕失去, 還算是愛嗎?   16) 威尼斯像舞台佈景, 今天刮風,聖馬可廣場上那些正在熱吻的男女,都像在訣別.   17) 在離別的那一刻, 我並不感到悲傷, 我只是感到難過.   18) 難過和悲傷是不同的.   19) 悲傷是失去情人; 難過是失去旅伴, 失去一個恩師.   20) 我毫無理由地愛着另一個人,我彷彿知道他早晚會回到我身邊.   21) 我祝願他永遠不要悲傷, 我期望我們能用歡愉來迎接重逢.   22) 有時我覺得他是一個拒絕長大的男人.   23) 長大有什麼好呢? 長大了, 就要面對很多痛苦.   24) 在對的時間遇到錯的人, 在錯的時間遇到對的人.   25) 候鳥回歸, 但是一直在這裡的人, 卻另有牽掛, 重逢又怎樣? 我們不可能相擁.   26) 那璀璨繽紛, 在掌心上滾動的玻璃珠, 也像承諾一樣, 令人動心.   27) 葉散的時候, 你明白歡聚. 花謝的時候, 你明白青春.   28) 為什麼多麼決斷的男人, 一旦夾在兩個女人之間, 就立刻變得猶豫不決呢?   29) 也許正因為他是好男人, 才會猶豫不決吧.   30) 那你就不該離開, 誰等到最後, 就是勝利者.   31) 如果要等到最後才得到一個男人, 那又有什麼意思? 我寧願做失敗者.   32) 你說討厭別離, 卻總是要別離...   33) 我這一輩子也不會忘記你, 如果天天跟你在一起,           日後也許會把你忘掉, 這是別離的好處.   34) 在回憶裡, 每個人都年輕, 一切都是好的.   35) 如果能夠成為你身體的一部分, 你知道我想成為你哪一部分嗎?   36) 我想成為你雙眼, 那麼, 我就可以看到你所看的一切, 也許我會更明白你所做的事.   37) 想把一個男人留在身邊, 就要讓他知道, 你隨時可以離開他.   38) 我們的愛和傷痛, 是因為世上只有一個他.   39) 女人付出的代價往往比男人要大   待續..................................

       Little faith, brightens are rainy day Life is difficult you can go away Don't hide yourselves in a corner You have my place to stay 　 Sorrow is gonna say goodbye Opens up you see the happy sunshine Keep going on with your dream Chasing tomorrow sunrise The spirit can never dead 　 Sun will shine my friend Won't let you cry my dear Seeing you, share the tear Make my woe disappear You never be alone in darkness 　 Ssee my smile my friend We are with you holding hands You have God to believe You are my destiny We meant to be your friends That's what a friend should be

        能夠喜歡他就很幸福   簡簡單單就已經很滿足了   即使他給我的只是友情   我還是會一直守護著他   那是因為我很愛他.........          討厭自己常常把假的幻想成真................................................

       Kevin,   以下我講的東西,不是想你要怎樣對我,只是我的意見...   我看過很多長距離的情侶,都可以維持很久很久...   因為他們真的很愛對方,就算他們分開很久,也是心連心.   我有一個朋友,他比他女朋友小三年,跟她在一起兩年...   之後他們要分開不同的地方也在維持著...   我想說...我之前以為我們分手是因為長距離的問題...   原來是...你不再愛我才說分手的...   那你跟我在一起一年裡,你不是真的愛我的...   如果你還愛我的話,就算我們的距離有多遠,心也在一起吧...   但是我想不到,分手之後你會對我不理不睬...好像陌生人...   我想說...如果你真的想找一個真心愛你,你也真心愛她的話,   你應該選一個跟你認識很久,她好了解你,你也真的了解她,   你才可以對她說你愛她...   不是像我們兩個,剛認識就就說愛你...   這感情不會維持好久的...   你一定要好好珍惜你現在擁有的一切...   (我以上說的話只是祝福...不是要你回我身邊)   我只是用朋友的身份跟你說這些話...   珍重...   Jamie

       翻著我們的照片 想念若隱若現   去年的冬天 我們笑得很甜   看著你哭泣的臉 對著我說再見   來不及聽見 你已走得很遠   也許你已經放棄我 也許已經很難回頭   我知道自己錯過 請再給我一個理由   說你不愛我 就算是我不懂 能不能原諒我   請不要把分手當作你的請求   我知道堅持要走是 你受傷的藉口   請你回頭 我會陪你一直走到最後   就算沒有結果 我也能夠隨   我知道你的痛 是我給的承諾   你說給過我縱容 沉默是因為包容   如果要走 請你記得我 如果難過 請你忘了我

       Ohhh....... Ingrid went back to HK today... She will have so much fun in HK...      This morning I woke up so early to ready to see Ingrid off. Host mom drove us to airport. We saw Ingrid to check-in and enter the gate. After that, we met Kurt again. He drove us to a chinese restaurant to "yum cha" SO YUMMY~! I haven't "yum cha" for a year... maybe it was because i didn't eat for a year and there is sth happen in my stomach. After we left the restaurant, I kept going to washroom. I got a serious stomachache. Then, Kurt drove us to Metrotown and dropped us off. YO~! JOanne and I went window shopping a lot in Metrotown. We walked around in the mall and my legs were getting tired. First, we went into a interesting store to buy a clock. That clock is so cool, joanne bought it for her room. After that, we went most of the shops which were sells clothes. I saw a lot of clothes that i wanna buy... but i can't buy it, because i am saving money...Then, we bought one bubble tea with red bean (my favourite) to share. We bought us a knapsack, I love this knapsack, it was so cool~! I will use it all the time in school.^^ We went to "Crystal Mall" to buy sth which was shoelace. I bought a very nice shoelace which was pink and red for my best friend~! At 5:00pm we took skytrain and bus to Langley Centre. When we were in Langley Centre, we missed the bus to our home... We had to wait the bus for an hour... Finally, we got home~! phew~! tired..........

       分手的一煞或者很不好過 苦痛到我要生要死   曾話過要去懷著怨氣 這一世也要決心憎你   但我知花必須要謝 春天必須變夏天   我也有天心死 稀風雪亦要繼續前行      毛毛細雨 萬象更新 一概清洗心中的怨恨   人是會轉季節會變更 承受過冷與折磨過的枯枝   春季後亦可再生      也許不應該憎恨人 好應該感動人 失戀都這樣勇敢   既是成年人 無謂再拿謠言誣蔑你 事後便罪加一等   再經過短短的春夏和秋冬來忘掉你 現在活得多開心   跟你渡過 這麼多年 都算是朋友 何用變做仇人      舊事算數 大道康莊   跟你握握手冰釋怨恨 離別了你我至會瞭解   其實我也會有力氣抵擋冬天最寒冷的氣溫      隨著季節變化 開始想不起了你的眼神   來日你也讚歎 我也會劫後重生      一個目送 夏去秋來 等我用時間 忘掉這舊情人
