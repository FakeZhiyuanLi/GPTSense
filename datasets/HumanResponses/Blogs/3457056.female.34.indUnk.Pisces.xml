						   Yesterday I sat in church, and despite being very interested in Graeme's thoughts on why we should stop sinning if we know in advance we will be forgiven, my mind kept wandering off on it's own.  I so rarely have that very focussed "I'm on the ball" feeling anymore.  I wonder if it is an age thing or just that I am tired.  Hard to say.  G actually slept through the night on Saturday, so I should have been hopping mentally on Sunday, but I wasn't.  B was wicked Sunday afternoon, and took a paracetamol capsule I had put on the table and ate it.  I put it down, went and picked up G, came back to have them, and the little toad had snavelled them, and eaten one, holding the other in her hot little hand.  Rang the Poison's Info Hotline for the second time in 8 days.  I wonder how long it takes for them to sic DOCS onto you?  Apparently one paracetamol for a 2 year old won't do irreparable damage.  Lucky.  She really is a ratbag.  We spent the weekend working on the hammock for G.  It is up and running now, and she is lying in it sleeping as I type.  It's just magic, I am so pleased with it.  J did a beautiful job on the hanger,and the sling bit which I ran up looks quite fine too.  But the best thing is she likes it.  What's not to like?  It looks so comfy, the boys both asked if they could have one.  J rang a little while ago, he has been perusing the real estate pages and found a beautiful house inBlaxlnad.  So much for the extension.  Although the way I feel with the very cramped conditions in this house, I would be happy to move.  Well sort of.  I love it here, I love the boys being able to walk to school, I love the neighbours, and the street, and everything really, except the house is too small.  We are absolutely crammed into such a weeny space.  6 people in three (small) bedrooms, and one bathroom.  The toilet issue is a pretty big one actually.  However did the Brady Bunch manage?  Still getting organised for the business launch.  I made a sleeping bag/blankie thing for G yesterday, and took it out this morning to M&M's (good advertising), it was much admired, and I suspect I will get some business if I can strike while the proverbial iron is hot.  Must get my bum into gear.  Is bum a proper swear word?  I m trying to stop swearing.  It's a very bad example to the boys, and I really don't want them to do it.  Trying to cut saying "frig" to.  It's such an ugly word, and quite satisfying, but I heard D say it on the weekend, and its not a bit nice.  There are chocolate biscuits in the fridge that I am trying not to eat.  I am tired of being fat, I know I like it much better when I am not as heavy as I am now.  And when I'm breastfeeding, I do shed the weight fairly easily (well comparatively), so I should just get to and do it, instead of putting it off.  It's so boring though.  Went to visit Nell on Friday afternoon, little Stephanie has lost her newborn look, and is starting to look like a person, instead of squashy and wierd (as all newborns do look).  Nell is such a lovely woman, its been nice to get to know her better.  Might go look at these realestate pages, see if there is anything I like, less amazing but cheaper than what J found.

						   While I sympathise with public educators in Australia, having been one of them, I am less than impressed with strikes.  Is there not a better way to get their point across.  Today has been ok, but next Wednesday is a headache.  I have a gynaecologist apointment that I absolutely cannot take the boys too, for their sakes as well as mine. SO I have to organise someone to take care of them.  One of the disadvantages of a big family is locating baby sitters, who besides Grandparents is going to want to take on my tribe?  Anyway, GrannieAnnie has jumped at the chance to be with them, so it's not  all bad, except for not wanting to share with her what I'm up to.  "A Doctor's Appointment"  will hopefully suffice as an explanation, she surely couldn't ask for specifics?  I say this, but after 12 years, I tend to expect the worst from her.  At least then I can be pleasantly surprised.  This morning we went to visit J at Chez H.  D went to Ryan's house.  I always has to be "doing", it is not enough to simply "be", so I thought it would be nice to arrange something that I would enjoy too.  And it was.  B was much nicer today than earlier in the week, though when I told her before we departed that she wasn't allowed to push Emerald over today, she said "oohhhhh", in that voice that means "why ever not?"  SHe did behave better, and only pushed her once that I saw.  Oh, and ran her down with the push along car.  I guess the perfect baby would inevitably grow up to be like every other toddler, but its still a bit of a shock, she has hitherto been delightful, and while I tried hard not to be smug about her delightfulness, I was deep down.  Serves me right, it's come back to bite me on the bum now.  Weather has turned, and while I do like being cooler, after 9 months of feeling overheated, I am remebering why I have never liked being cold.  Its nasty.  G has already expressed her distaste for windy weather, it makes her grumpy.  On another track, I wonder if the overheating in pregnancy is indicative of how many hot flushes I will suffer when I go through The Change (many years in the future).  I'll probably be a blazing furnace.  B has woken up in a truly foul mood, not sure why.  Maybe she doesn't like feeling cold either.  If she kept her shoes and socks on she would probably be happier.  She has wept and whined since she got out of her bed.    J got home last night and decided he wouldn't go to watch State of Origin with the blokes from church.  I knew the night Ian rang that he wouldn't go.  He never likes going out on week nights after work, and when he said he would drive himself I was even more certain.  And he doesn't even like football, or whatever it is that they play for SofO.  I think he tries to keep that from the other blokes though, in case they think he's not a real man or something.  It's ideal for our marriage that he couldn't give a tinkers cuss about who wins the World Cup or SofO or any other sporting event, suits me if he is not parked interminably in front of the telly watching some incomprehensible and boring game.    Jen is organising a writers group with her friend Trudy, they even put an ad. in the gazette.  She's had three people ring already, a woman who talks a lot (well I am assuming she talks a lot, all I heard was Jen's side of the conversation, which was constantly interupted), and has a grandson who is gay.  A man who is a retired lecturer in criminology, (perhaps Australia's answer to Val McDermid or Patricia Cornwall?), and another woman, whom I know nothing about, except her name might be Diane.  Or Diane could be the lady with the gay grandson, not sure.  Feel slightly intimidated by the criminologist, but perhaps he will be a great source of information to help me pad out my crime novel.  I'd rather he was a historian though.

						   I just had fun creating my profile, but when I looked at it, the site has worked me out to be a Pisces, and I'm NOT, I'm an Aquarian, on the cusp, but still, really truly an Aquarian.  Not that I care either way, not that it's important, but still.  You grow up "knowing" your star sign, no matter whether you think its a load of bollocks or not, bit disconcerting to suddenly be something else after 30 something years.

						   I don't really know quite what I am doing yet, very new to the world of blogging.  I kept a diary for years, but a set amount of space for each day was inhibiting.  I felt I could never start to write stories about our days, in case I ran out of room.  So it degenerated to a very boring kind of record, nothing really was said, only hinted of.  Not much use when I am a forgetful old lady I expect.   Today has been a pretty average day at the house of Grouse.  J is at work, and not expected back for some hours yet.  Although I love where we live, its not convenient to the suburb he works in, so he's away for half of every day, a considerable chunk when he has to fit 8 hours of sleep into the hours he spends at home.  I and D went to school.  They came home with an information pack on Meningococcal C.  I wanted to know if he really had to have the jab, and would it hurt.  The short answer is Yes and Yes.  It's free, and a good idea, and of course it will hurt, how could sticking a needle in your arm and pushing liquid into your muscle not hurt?  It's quite unnatural.  B has had a better day toda, ie she HASN'T been sick all over her bed.  SHe has had a bit of diarrhea though.  Roll on toilet training, I suspect that when I only have one bottom to change it will feel like a holiday.  She managed a poo in the pot last week.  I was delighted, she was appalled.  She kept looking at it wide eyed, and saying "Howible Mummy, yuk".  Much easier than scraping it off the nappy into the lav though.    G has been wakeful.  She has such bright little possum eyes, they follow us around the room now, and she smiles in delight when one of us bends over her to chat.  Especially if she happens to be on the change table.  Obviously there is something altogether hilarious about lying there with a bare bum waving your legs in the air.  Pity I'm too big to fit on the table, I could try it and see what all the fuss is about.  No I don't like the mental picture that makes AT ALL.    I made another test nappy today, not quite as successful as the one I amde In B's size yesterday.  The tabs are too wide.  Easily modifiable of course, but it means I can't cut into my fabric yet.  Still, I haven't got my hemp, so thats ok.  Got a shipping quote for my Aplix.  $9US, ouch.  How heavy could it possibly be.  I suspect that I am being ripped off a tad.  I'll have to work out another source.  Might try the HTH from Janie at Wee Wuns.  Got another quote for labels - $412, for 1000.  As J says, will I really make 1000 nappies??  Maybe I will, if I can sell that many I will certainly try.  I am not expecting to make my fortune from my nappy business, which is probably just as well.     I just looked at a preview of this post, and I must say it looks most professional.  Much neater than my diary crtaily.  My handwriting is horrible unless I try really hard, then it takes ages and makes my hand all cramped and achey.  Much easier to type.  Wonder if its really boring to other people.  Wonder if it matters??

						   The Bronster is on a mission, to break as many pairs of specs belonging to family member as she possibly can. She broke a pair of mine, a pair of J's, she took Dads out of his pocket while he was sleeping and bent them up, and she has just found and broken J's prescription sun glasses.  He DIDN'T go off the deep end, which I thought very commendable.  Well, he shouldn't leave them down where she can get to them, and with her record, I would think it would be uppermost in his mind everytime they left his face.  Anyway, she has taken all her energy and negativity off to bed for a nap now thank goodness.  I had forgotten what a total pain in the rear 2 year olds can be.  She has learnt a new word this week - WHY?  The boys never said Why?  and I am truly greatful for that now.  Why and No are major players in her vocabulary at the moment.  SHe is really being a sod.  Good thing we love her so much, or we'd throw her in the bin.  I wonder if we will get to Harry Potter this weekend, I has been banned for his temperamental outburst  a few days ago, but I would like to take D (if only to rub I's nose in his punishment).  And I just want to see it.  I hope G will be ok for a few hours without her bosom (or rather my bosom).  I listed my first nappies on ebay today, and I feel so nervous about them.  What if people don't like them.  I think they are lovely, but perhaps they are actually total crap.  I think if that happens, i will have to resign from the nappy group and hide away.  I think they look beautiful, and I'd love to keep them, but that is not the point, and the girls are pretty well off for nappies, covers is another story though.  G is awake again, and its hard to blog and joggle her around on my knee, so I'll have to finish again.

						   Well, apparently it is anyway.  I had a major meltdown last night, and I am still reeling today.  It was really B's fault (damn 2 year olds, they're a pest).  She dragged all the books out of the boys bookcase, again.  Since she discovered this game about a week ago, she has emptied the bookcases throughtout hte house with monotonous regularity.  I have most of the shelves packed so tight she can't get anything out and neither can anyone else, but there is a shelf on the boys bookcase which is eluding me, she can trash it no matter how many books are stuffed onto it.  So she did it again last night, and I asked I to pop them back in for me.  Which he did with a very bad grace, and I can understand that, we are all growing weary of restacking those shelves, but he whacked B's hand with a book and made her cry (he says he didn't, but he did), and then he belted D over the head for some smart aleck 8 year old comment he made.  So I told him off, then he hit the roof.  He shouted at me, and at the other kids, and he slammed B's door so hard, it came off the runner and broke all the bottom of it, and he couldn't get back out of the room.  J arrived home just as we had reached this point, and he flew into a rage as well.  He whacked I with a rolled up newspaper, not particularly painful I think, but satisfying.  And it made him scream blue murder., then he turned his wrath on J, and treated us al to a tirade, which included how he was going to commit suicide when he got older, and that would teach us all a good lesson, except it wouldn't because we'd be HAPPY (this is I raving).  And it went on and on, and escalated way out of proportion.  I just didn't know what to say, prayed for wisdom, but I think God said no, or hopefully he said wait, because I don't feel much wisdom yet that is sure and certain.    Asked tentatively this morning if he felt any better, and he said that he did, so here's hoping.  I hope he is having a good day at school, I hate to think of hium unhappy.  He is very extreme, it isn't snowing, its BLIZZARDING.    As for me, my carpal tunnel syndrome (self diagnosed) is getting worse, so I've made an appointment ot see the doctor next week.  Hope there is some miraculous cure for it.  The girls and I went to Lincraft this morning, and got fabric for more sleeping bags - polar fleece being on special at the moment.  Business is going well.  Once I sell all the bags out of this material, I should be in the black.

						   I thought that blogging would make me more disciplined with my writing, but ti isn't working out that way really.  Of course,the fact that I am generally sitting here with G either attached to the boob, or otherwise sitting on my knee, occupying one hand probably doesn't help.  And, I have had a lot of sewing to do.  I got three orders last week - all finished now, and looking gorgeous.  I am so impressed with the things I've made, I can't stop looking at them to tell the truth.  I hope it will all take off and be a success, because I am liking doing it.  I sewed all Sunday afternoon, and let J deal with the kids.  It was actually very nice to sit and sew, and if they asked me for stuff, I just pointed them in his direction.  I think he finds it hard to coordinate them all, with their different needs.  B is fairly demanding, what 2 year old isn't?  And then G is lots of hands on stuff too.  Margot visited on Saturday, and we all went to Euroka Clearing for lunch.  It's always so peaceful there, and there were kangaroos, the kids love that.  Actually, I do too.  David hopped about pretending to be a kangaroo, to try and get closer to them - it didn't work, they knew kangaroos don't wear blue denim.  B kept running after them shouing "Kangaroooo", she was quite exultant.    Margot managed to offend Isaac, by telling him she didn't want one of his Isaac fruit delights, as it sounded horrible, then wouldn't apologise because she couldn't see why that was rude.    Better go, will right more again later.  G is weeping, I think there are nappies to change and baths to run.
