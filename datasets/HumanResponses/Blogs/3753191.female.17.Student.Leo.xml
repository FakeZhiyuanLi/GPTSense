      I have mixed feelings on our war in Iraq.  Now that we know there was no connection between Hussein and bin Laden in regards to the 9/11 attacks, I am concerned with our reasons behind going over there.  I think I would have much preferred that we had simply gone after bin Laden and al Queda.  On the other hand, the improvements that have been made in Iraq since the war began cannot be ignored.    Some have used gruesome photos of Americans being decapitated in order to convince us that this war is necessary.  Well, I see it differently.  Such activity gives me more reason to believe that we should not be in this war.  Can it even be called a war when our enemy is too pitiful and too much of a coward to actually fight a fair battle?  Kidnapping an American soldier and threatening to behead him is not courageous and it is not by any means indicative of warfare.  It's exactly what it is:  kidnapping.    If our enemy won't come out and fight, it's not a war.  Period.  This will continue happening to our servicemen if the U.S. military is not soon brought out of the middle east.  Being a military brat I generally have the tendency to argue that when a man or woman joins the armed forces, they understand that they are signing their life away, figuratively and literally.    But let's face it, this isn't what they signed up for.  This isn't real battle.  These terrorists, cowards, have no honor and have no sense of what it means to be real men and fight for what they believe fair and square.  They will continue their disgusting acts because they are heartless and simply don't care.  At the same time, I can't say that we should bring our boys back.  They must finish what these foolish terrorists have started, and I trust they will.

      So.  Britney's engaged to dancer guy Kevin who has one child and another one on the way by his ex-girlfriend.  This came as no surprise to me.  None of these things do anymore.  So if you were expecting some kind of major rant against her, think again.    Leave the girl alone.  I am sick of reading posts online by (teenaged) Britney fans playing mothers and fathers to her.  She is not a child and if she cared whether or not her fans approved, she'd ask your opinion.  But she didn't.  So leave it alone.  What irks me more is that this Kevin guy is being judged and because of his image, Britney is being treated like some little girl blinded by "love" who can't see that he's nothing but problematic.  Perhaps he is.  Why does it matter to you?  Oh wait, let me guess.  Because you  care  about Britney?  Give me a break.  If you cared about her you'd let her make her own decisions (and yes, even mistakes) free of ridicule.  I still don't see why any teenager thinks that he or she has any ground upon which to tell a grown adult how to lead her life.  It is utterly pathetic that Britney must be judged and criticized for her every move, choice and bad decision when people her age and  older  are out there doing the same damn things (or worse).       Yesterday my dad and I were watching FoxNews.  They showed Britney and Kevin on some beach with the paparazzi swarming around them incessantly in a scene that reminded me much of a group of angry bees attacking some poor defenseless individual.    I would  never  want to be Britney Spears.

      Ok so, one article claims that the fabulous fivepiece will tour Europe this fall.  But this tour will be different from their last, in which they filled arenas.  On  this  tour the Boys will be doing 3,000 seater venues.  Interesting indeed.    At first I was hardly pleased with what was supposed to be exciting news, as the very same article revealed the title of the first single from their upcoming album.   Climbing the Walls , a tune by who else but Max Martin.  But let's get back on topic.   Oh no!  I thought.   How will I ever adjust to tiny venues?!  How will it ever be the same?  The melodrama played out in my mind like a bad soap opera.    From the article I got the impression that Johnny Wright, their new (kind of) manager (he managed them in the beginning of their career), is starting the Backstreet Boys all over again.  When they debuted as a group they weren't doing so well in the United States, so they headed on over to Europe where they were accepted instantaneously.  Funny thing, too.  Now all European fans think they have some kind of right to the Boys because they gained popularity there first.   Chuckle.   So here's what I think.  They're touring Europe to ignite the smothered Backstreet flame there, and doing so in small venues so as not to embarrass themselves if they don't fill arenas.  That's fine.  And smart.  If they do the same in the United States, I won't be heartbroken but I do wonder what it'll be like.  Hopefully it will be easier to get closer seats and perhaps better concert photos will be the result.  We'll see.  What I'm most interested in at this point is the music.   Beautiful Woman  has been proof enough that they are capable of giving their sound a fresh and edgier style that would undoubtedly do well on the charts given the right promotion.  And you know what?  I want edge, but I also want that classic Backstreet feel, which there's no doubt in my mind they will deliver beautifully.  Alright, if I'm being honest, they could record a song with lyrics consisting of names and numbers out of a phone book and it would be better than anything on top 40 radio right now.  It's Backstreet 2004 and I'm ready for their return.  Oh so ready.

      Hey.  How ya doin'?  I'm starting this blog because...well, I'm not entirely sure.  Just seemed like the "in" thing to do, I s'pose.  No one will read this and that's fine.  I'm a journalism student from Eastern North Carolina, which is basically all you need to know about me for now.  I'll be mostly posting my opinions here, as I am not much of a day-to-day diary writer.  I've never been good at that.

      Work was okay.  I had to man the phone but it wasn't too bad.  You know what I wouldn't be able to stand if I had to answer it all the time?  Whenever someone calls wanting to place a classified ad, we have to redirect them to a different office in a different town that handles such ads for all of the publications under this certain company.    From my experience, when I let them know and begin to read off the phone number they need to call, they interrupt me and say, "why do I have to call there?" (even though I had just explained it) or even better, "you guys don't do ads in your office?"  Um, isn't that what I just said?  lol.  I'm the last person that needs to be answering a phone in an office.  :)  So I put C's (won't say his name here) final column in the paper today and read it over.  He's headed for ECU (as am I in a year or two) and also intends to major in Communications.  I would normally think it'd be pretty cool to possibly see someone from my town around campus up there in Greenville, but I just don't know about the guy.  His last column was on abortion, and as I suspected, he's just as conservative as ever.  Several of his columns over the course of the past 10 months have leaned to the extreme right, and it's taken everything within me not to send him a nasty response to any of them.    His abortion piece nearly put me over the edge when he very bluntly called pro-choicers ignorant.  I hope ECU teaches him a few things about journalism.  It is one thing to use such strong language or insults in a one-on-one debate; it is entirely another to use the newspaper as a media by which to blatantly bash not just an opposing viewpoint, but the group of individuals who disagree with you.  Editorial/commentary or not, you don't just resort to name calling because you think you can.  I felt like he took advantage of the opportunity to let his voice be heard and wasted a lot of reader time with the way in which he presented himself.  He was extremely lucky to have been given the opportunity to express his views during an election year.    It's nice that he does indeed write with passion, and does so very well, but I think his ego needs to subside.  Taking a more modest, direct approach (he uses a lot of silly, sarcastic fluff) in your writing will get you farther in the game, and you'll be much more respected in the end.  Then again, with his brand of "journalistic integrity?  What's that?" writing, he should fit in nicely with today's crop of controversial wannabes so many news channels and major newspapers are laden with.    Well, it should be interesting if I end up in any of his classes at ECU.  ;)  Speaking of ECU, look what my mom got me for my birthday.            A cute hoodie and what they literally call "butt shorts."  lol.  I know, it's not my birthday yet and I shouldn't know what she got me, but there were a few different hoodies to pick from and she asked which one I wanted.  :)  Unfortunately there weren't any in the school's colors (purple and gold) that I liked, so I picked the next best thing.    Oh, and my poor Echo is getting random scratches out of nowhere.  It's really starting to annoy me.  So is all the rain.  I cleaned the car thoroughly and four days later the rain comes and then a hurricane hits.  :(  There's no point in attempting to keep a car clean in eastern North Carolina.  Seriously.    But luckily tropical storm Earl died off and is leaving the weekend clear so we can head up to Busch Gardens for my birthday.  I love roller coasters.  Anyone who's been to Busch Gardens Williamsburg will tell you the Apollo's Chariot rocks.  Heck, I love that whole amusement part.  The entire Williamsburg area is just gorgeous and the park is no different.    They've designed it to have separate "country" areas.  I love the Italy section.  The last time we went, we watched the show they put on there and they asked my sister to volunteer to play the part of a waitress while a guy sang a song to her.  In it he talks about a girl named Angelina the waitress.  Guess what my sister's name is?  Angelina.  lol.  We got a kick outta that.  I hope the weather is decent when we go.  The last time we went (a month or two ago), the weather was perfect.  I hate standing in long lines in the heat, but it wasn't hot at all.  It's probably silly to expect a repeat performance of that, but we'll see.  I'm still waiting for classes to start.  It seems like Wednesday will never get here.  Ahhhh.

      It's still gloomy outside, but at least the temperatures have dropped.  Wow, I've resorted to talking about the weather.  I must truly be bored.  I can't wait for classes to start so I have something to do.  I had planned on doing something with Christina, but she's leaving for nursing school soon.  This sucks.  Anyway, I don't really have much to say today.  I did want to post my favorite picture from Sophie's 2nd birthday party we had for her at Chuck E. Cheese.      Just hilarious and adorable all at once.  lol.  I absolutely love it.  :)  I'm hoping that storm, Earl, doesn't make his way up here.  If he does, he'll hit on my birthday and we had planned on going to Busch Gardens in Williamsburg.   Um, what else?  We're going bowling today (yippee).  It should be amusing to say the least.

      The other day I said I may as well be hit by a bus, right? Would Hurricane Charley be the equivalent of a bus? Hm. Well, he didn't exactly do much terror where I live. It seems he unleashed his fury on poor Florida. It is a little windy and hard rain is coming in bursts here. No worse than a thunderstorm, I suppose. I still hate hurricanes, it literally paralyzes our entire area and we somehow end up wasting yet another day doing nothing. I think our entire town is shut down today (lol). Not to mention, it's my dad's birthday and we're stuck at home. It would have been nice to take him out to dinner or something. I guess we can make up for it tomorrow.  Now allow me to rant.  National news channels and the Weather Channel crack me up when it comes to hurricanes. FoxNews has been covering the storm all-freakin'-day. If I see anymore images of Punta Gorda, FL on TV today, I may scream. Surely that can't be the only town that has seen devastation caused by the hurricane. Some woman from the Red Cross told the FoxNews anchor that this is the biggest relief effort since 9/11. What?! How exactly does one begin to compare a tragic terrorist attack to a natural disaster? That doesn't make sense to me.  And I am so sick of Floridians who cry over Hurricane Andrew to this day. They act as if they're the only ones who've ever been dealt catastrophic blows by such storms. Give me a break. In 1999, Floyd put much of eastern North Carolina under water, but that's the 'cane most people like to forget in favor of their prized sob stories over Andrew. Ugh.  You know what's worse? Because news channels and such are based in NJ, NY and D.C., they like to go on and on about how a 'cane is headed their way. Um, okay, you're going to get some wind and rain and you're rushing out to the store to stock up on food and water when there are people in Florida who are now homeless or DEAD? Are you kidding me? It really makes New Englanders look weak and silly. Come down to the Carolinas or Florida and ride out the true brunt of a major hurricane, then let me hear you complain about some wind and rain.  Anyway, I'm done ranting (it felt good). :) You know what? I'm happy. After reading my apology in my previous post, my friend and I started talking again and things are back to normal. I knew the cold shoulder, silent treatment wouldn't last long. We're inseperable, yo. This is for you. ;)   Ashlee Simpson -  Pieces of Me    I am moody, messy   I get restless, and it's senseless    How you never seem to care   When I'm angry, you listen   Making me happy, it's your mission   And you won't stop till I'm there     Ok, enough with the mushiness. You get the point. Baha. Um, let's see, what else is happening as of late? I'm starting classes on Wednesday. I have to drive to NB (don't want to say the name of the town here) for Biology class every Monday and Wednesday night until December. It's a 20 minute drive or so, which also means I'm going to be spending more money on gas.  Sigh . I guess it's the price you pay for higher education. I think the Intro to Ethics class should be interesting; too bad it's only one night a week.  Can you believe a woman I work with asked for my fall semester schedule so she can tell me when I should come in to man the phone? It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that she is using me to take more days off. Nevermind the fact that I really don't enjoy talking on the phone, and the last time I did go in for this, I got rude calls. I could just imagine how much they'd dislike it if I decided to take next Friday off (my birthday) so I can enjoy turning 18.  A new copy editor was recently hired and I met her yesterday. The same woman who asked for my fall schedule also introduced me to my new coworker, saying that I "type stuff up" for the editor. Gee thanks. I do a lot more than that, but whatever. Technically I had taken the position of copy editor until the new girl was hired.  Speaking of which, I think copy editing is what I want to do (at least at an entry level position) when I start hunting for my first job after college. You know, for the last four or five years I've been set on majoring in journalism, but after doing a bit of research I started having doubts. I'm spending a lot of money and putting a lot of effort toward going to college and getting my bachelor's degree, only to go into a disgracefully low-paid field in which I'll receive just enough to get by in a small apartment and my barely-paid-for Toyota Echo.  Journalists do a thankless (and horribly underpaid) job. Not only is it thankless, but those in the field are often accused of being biased, slanting the news, showing favoritism towards one political party or the other, etc. Talk about shooting the messenger. And the newspaper business is dying. The general population is relying on TV and the internet for instantaneous news. Newspapers are having to lay off their employees in some cases.  Double sigh .  Aaaaanyway, I think the only thing I have left to say for now is a note to  Mira . Thanks for the comment you left on my last post (that is, if you were being sincere. I feel you were though). :) It was very nice -- unexpected, but nice nonetheless.

      What a week.  Broke up with Matt and lost a friend in a matter of days.  Maybe tomorrow I'll be hit by a bus or something.  Because there's so many buses in this town...yeah.  That would top it off nicely.   What is it about me?  I'm just different from other people.  Instead of having several acquaintances, I keep a few very close friends.  Now I realize why so many people choose to keep a bit of a distance from their 'friends.'  It's not such a hard loss if one slips through your fingers.  I'm not perfect by any means.  Anyone who knows me will tell you I'm temperamental, moody and easily agitated.  I don't choose my words carefully (or keep my mouth shut) when I probably should.  I realize I have been stricken with these traits and attempt to keep them in check as much as I can, but it usually doesn't work.  Why should I be so surprised when I offend or hurt someone close to me?   You know what, I need to stop taking advantage of people.  The friend I lost today always kept a cool head with me even when I wasn't the most pleasant person to chat with.  He dealt with my flaws better than most people could, and I screwed it up because I allowed myself to take advantage of his good nature.   So, you-know-who, I am sincerely sorry.  I don't expect things to ever be the same, nor do I expect you to talk to me again, but please know that I regret what I said.   By the way, I finally broke 100k in mids.  Still haven't beat you though.   Figures.
