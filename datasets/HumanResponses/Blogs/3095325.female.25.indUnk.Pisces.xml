      People who find me watching Cartoon Network on TV often ask this question. Considering the ripe age of 25, marriage and being in a serious professional like engineer, why don’t I indulge in a suitable pastime? Maybe reading perhaps or cooking, or at least gossiping? I could watch Discovery or some mindless soap opera, but cartoons??? They might be in for another shock, if I let them know that I also regularly read comic strips in newspapers, apart from purchasing comic books once in a while.  Cartoons still bring me a few moments of laughter after a hard working day and boring routine. They never fail to tickle my funny bone with the jokes, the repartees, some fast action; just pure fun. Fun, which doesn’t require using much of my already weary mind. Watching them is the perfect way of relaxing. My favorites include, “Dexter: the boy wizard” and “Tom & Jerry”, closely followed by anything that has to do with Donald Duck. In print, I love to read “Calvin and Hobbes” (which is also my husband’s favorite), “Garfield”, “Blondie” and “Denise the Menace”.  I always start my mornings by pulling out the cartoons page from our newspaper, a better way of beginning the day than catching up often depressing headlines.   So folks, I am not going to change! I’ll keep doing what I love. Devil may care!

      Sometime back, one sleepy afternoon, I turned on the TV to find that an interesting documentary on Discovery channel was being aired. It was about a woman, a photo-journalist, who covered Bosnian war.   Although I cannot remember her name now, but I guess she is well known (the documentary itself was evidence to this and it also mentioned about a movie made on her life and war experience in which Andy McDowell portrayed her).  She narrated an incidence that happened during her stint in Bosnia. She had a boyfriend (a fellow journo), who had gone to cover the war there before her, and then disappeared. Worried for him, she went on searching for him when sent there herself on assignment. Fearing the worst, she looked in every possible place she hoped to find him. And finally, found him in a dilapidated hospital, badly wounded. Unfortunately, soon afterwards there was an attack on that hospital. She knew, horrified, that whoever didn’t manage to run away from hospital would be brutally killed.  This is where she almost choked trying to hold back her tears. Meanwhile, I dreaded the thought that she might have watched helplessly her boyfriend being killed. Then,…she spoke again. She informed us that they both managed to escape with help of a few locals.  So what was the cause of her grief then, I wondered? Well, it so happened that her boyfriend informed her that he was saved and brought to hospital by a local girl. She was also taking good care of him and he had fallen in love with her!!! Later, her (ex) boyfriend married that local girl and settled there. Well, our photo-journo lady was broken-hearted and returned home after finishing her assignment. She somehow got over the harrowing experiences of the war, but she couldn’t get over this.  I’ve always wondered since then what made her still hanker after her ex? She had everything in the world; a great career, lots of adventure, a slew of enviable assignments, fame, and awards. She could easily be a role model to others; I could myself give anything in the world to be like her. But all she wanted was getting married to her ex and raising a family!  It seems nobody wants what he/she has got in life, they want something else, something just opposite of it :-(.
