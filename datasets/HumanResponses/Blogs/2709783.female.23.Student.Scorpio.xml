      You know what pisses me off?  People who get a paper cut and bitch about it for twenty minutes.  There aren't that many things to say about a paper cut that aren't already common knowledge.  It's always the same whines, too.  Wow, it's so amazing that such a little cut can hurt so badly.  Or, omigosh, it's bleeeeeeding!  Everyone has had a damn paper cut, we don't need a narration of the trauma.  Most people have even had one that bled.  It's not worth yammering about for longer than 10 seconds.    I also don't need to know about the band-aid you put on your paper cut that miraculously heals as it covers, or the time you gave a band-aid to a man who had a paper cut.    I'm a little irritated today, in case you can't tell.  It might be because I'm tired, and just getting un-hungover, and stayed up until 2 when I have to get up at 5:30.  But if I were a betting person, I would place the blame for my churlishness on people bitching about paper cuts.

      One of the big bonuses of living and working north of Waco is getting Dallas radio stations.  Don't get me wrong, I love my 102.5 and NPR, but you just can't beat 97.1 The Eagle's Mandatory Metallica and lots of classic Pantera in the morning.  97.1 also provides a great place to hear the local bands and find out about upcoming events.    Imagine my surprise when I tuned into my favorite station on Tuesday morning.  They were playing Elton John's song about his blind brother Daniel, and I assumed it was part of a morning show joke.  I flipped the station a few times, returned to Preset #4 and was greeted with Billie Myers' "Kiss the Rain".  What the hell?  With no warning,  urlLink Clear Channel Communications  changed the only real rock station in the greater Metroplex area to crappy lite muzak.  They should have gone ahead and changed the call letters to KSUK, or KGAY, or KRAP, I could go on.    I have nothing against lite rock.  I just want an alternative (pun intended).    Damn you, Clear Channel!  Check out  urlLink this  link.  It rocks.

      Well.  Not only did I just foil a potential sexual predator, in doing so I also set a personal record for the route I was running.  Go me!  I run about 25 miles a week.  Usually, I run in the mornings anytime between 5:30 and 11am, depending on my schedule and level of motivation.  From my house I have a 3 mile loop and a 6 mile loop that I like, both of which are on scenic, quiet roads.  Unfortunately for my Olympic running aspirations, as of late, I have been leaving for work around 6, meaning that it's dark when I actually have time to run (as if I would get up at 4:30).  I decided to switch my running to the evenings.  Tonight at 8, the sun was still up, the sky was blue, and I set out on the 6 mile route.  It usually takes me a little over an hour, so I figured it would be dusk when I got home.  Wrong.  The hazy glow I have been mistaking for "dusk" outside of my window at 9pm is actually the glow from the lights of the tennis courts on Lake Shore. My deductive powers sometimes astound me, yes.  I soon realized that it's going to be dark, not dusk, on my way back home.    It is at this point in my run, along a half-mile strech with no houses, that Creepy Guy appears.  He is riding a crotch rocket and wearing Oakley knockoffs (I assume they weren't real) even though it is, as I noted earlier, dark.  Creepy Guy speeds by me once.  No big deal, I think, making "sunglasses at night" jokes to myself.  Then he turns around about a mile ahead of me and drives by again, this time with less speeding involved and more cruising.   Twice  more this happens, more slowly each time.  This exponentially multiplies the   Law and Order: SVU   episodes I am remembering that involve dark deserted roads and creepy guys on small motorbikes.    At the turnaround point of my run, I am at Lake Shore Drive.  It is the same distance to make the block and run down Lake Shore as it is to turn around and run back into Creepy Guy's well-laid trap that certainly existed.  The Lake Shore option involves running 3 miles down one of the busiest streets in northeast Waco, praying that I don't get run over by an early drunk.  I wondered where Jaimee and Coby were at the time.  In the end, I decided that I would rather get hit by a truck than raped by a guy who drives a quasi-motorcycle that sounds like a blender.  I hauled ass down Lake Shore.  And in the process of escaping, I had so much adrenaline from either a) having 18-wheelers whiz by me or b) imagining scenarios in which I kicked Creepy Guy's ass that I shattered my personal best on the 6 mile route by 6 minutes, an astounding accomplishment.  I almost wish I could be trailed by a frightening individual on all of my runs.

      One of my favorite Stephen King short stories is about a New England widow who buys a snazzy two seater convertible.  She drives it down the backroads so fast that she discovers an alternate universe/shortcut which allows her to get from point A to point B impossibly quickly.  I've always wanted to be able to do that.  Yesterday, in my zeal to find the shortest route to my new/old job at the USDA in Cleburne, I managed to drive about 2 hours longer than I needed to.  It was the opposite of the aforementioned short story.  En route to Cleburne, I simply misjudged the best way and took a slightly longer one, adding half an hour to my trip.  Okay.  On the way home, determined to make up for my morning, I missed the turn to the shortest way home and drove to Meridian.  That's right, 60 miles out of the way.  By the time I realized what was happening there were no turnoffs, but I kept thinking there would be and that I could get back to sunny Waco before, I don't know, dark.  (insert honking WRONG! noise here)  I did have the pleasure of driving through Morgan, Texas, where burros roam the streets.  Yes, I said burros.  I also spotted two extremely weird/funny things:  the Morgan cemetary appears to have no graves in it.  I'm not sure why you'd have an empty cemetary.  If it's because the residents of Morgan are trying to hide their immortality by creating a sham graveyard, they should add some fake headstones.  If it's because no one wants to be buried there (understandable), they shouldn't have wasted the taxpayers' money on a plot of land and iron gate.  Weird/funny thing #2:  The Lamb's Corral of Christian Fellowship in Laguna Park.  This is funny because the word "Corral" was obviously there before the others, leading me to believe that a religious organization took over a more questionable establishment but didn't take the time to re-do the signage.  It's like reverse satire.   To close, a good news/bad news pair.  Good news is, I'm back at a job I really enjoy for the summer.  This location will be a challenge, both for the commute and because of the backlog and previous lack of organization here, but I'm looking forward to it and I absolutely love the program.  I might note that by "previous lack of organization" I didn't mean simply pre-Randa, but for several years.  My presence is not what put Cleburne on the path of righteousness, but I'd like to think it will help.  Also, I like working for the government because I get to say cute little phrases like "good enough for government work."  On another note, one of my closest friends who is finishing a tour of duty in Korea learned he is probably going to Iraq in August.  I'll try not to turn this into a political rant.  He has a family back home and was looking forward to returning to Texas, as August will be four years and the army promised him no more foreign tours when he was sent to Korea.  He joined the military when he was 21 because of a dearth of employment/educational opportunities in the Abilene area and to "jump out of planes".  Who needs a draft when you have inner city and rural kids who will sign up because they have no other options?    Provide noncombat options to upper class elites while sending working class children to fight an unjust war?  Mission accomplished, Mr. President.

      In the spirit of summer road trips, I decided to go apartment shopping/campus touring in Lawrence this week.  I found a wonderful  urlLink apartment  and happily discovered that I like Lawrence very much.  Which removes one of my "things to worry about at night when I can't sleep."    I did make several interesting observations about the KS/OK drive and the states themselves; of course I expected some cultural shifts, like being asked if you'd like a "pop" when you really want a Dr. Pepper, or "coke."  But a few things really piqued my interest:  1.  Toll highways.  I know there is a tollway in Dallas, but I have never been on it.  I was unaware that toll roads are the Hotel California of the interstate highway system, with no exits and no gas stations for hundreds of miles.  I really thought I was going to be stranded in a wheat field somewhere between Oklahoma City and Kansas City, which is quite a stretch of nothing.  2.  The Kansas/McDonald's conspiracy.  On said toll roads, there *are* a few gas stations, with gasoline costing, of course, at least a dime more than it does at the gas stations you can see from the tollway but can't get to due to the lack of exits.  This is to be expected in a capitalist society, and didn't really bother me. I was so relieved to find gas I think I would have given a kidney to get a full tank.  What did bother me, though, was the complete lack of any competing fast food chains for about 350 miles of highway.  Only McDonalds.  Michael Moore would have a heydey in Kansas.  3.  One last toll-road observation:  there are no police.  I drove approximately 800 miles while in Kansas, and I still don't know what color their highway patrol cars are.  This is good for speeding, bad when you think you're about to run out of gas after dark.  4.  What are the inhabitants of Kansas called?  Kansans?  Kansites?  Kansonians?  5.  Based on my informal count, there is a disproportionate number of liquor stores for the population of Kansas.  This is okay in my book, but interesting nonetheless.    6.  Maybe I'm naive, but I didn't know that winters there were so bad you need covered parking to prevent the sleet from taking the paint off of your vehicle.  My excitement at being accepted to a law school (any law school) is rapidly decreasing at the prospect of winters being colder than they are in Waco.    7.  I was going to make a snarky comment about naming towns after foreign cities, like Ottowa, but then I remembered Paris, London, and Dublin, Texas and decided against it.  8.  There is an inordinate amount of signs on the roads warning against stopping in the median.  I wondered why this was such a problem, then I remembered observation number 5.  Probably a relationship there.  9.  Oklahoma.  This might be the worst part of living in Kansas.  I had never actually been to Oklahoma, but had always harbored a certain amount of distaste for the area since I am an eighth-generation Texan, and it's just bred into us.  I also, despite their poor selection procedures for law students, still love the Univeristy of Texas and therefore hate the Sooners.  But I always thought that the Okie stereotype was kind of like the Aggie stereotype--you know, once you meet a couple of Aggies you realize that some are idiots but others are very nice, intelligent people.    This does not apply to the Okie stereotype.  If any of my friends have Oklahoma roots, please do not destroy my opinion of you by telling me.  Oklahoma has a toll highway that is rougher than many unpaved roads I have been on.  Not only did I feel as though I was driving in a dry creek for 200+ miles, but I had to pay the state for this privilege.  On said highway, I happened to spot a policeman, and slowed my speed to 80 mph.  The Okie behind me, once we were safely past the patrolman, pulled up beside me and made an odd tomahawk-chop motion while scowling, which I assume is Okie sign language for, "Why did you prevent me from getting a ticket by flying past a state trooper at 90 mph, you bitch?"  I wracked my brain to remember the Okie sign language for, "Screw you, you ungrateful, inbred, obnoxious asshole," but had to settle for giving him a big Texan one-fingered wave.  I think the sentiment was adequately communicated.  Oklahoma's one redeeming value is that there is a Taco Bueno there.  But even fine Mexican fast food such as Bueno cannot restore this state to its once-average status in my mind.

      So there.  I have jumped on the blog bandwagon.  In light of my pending move to the Wheat State, I decided that my friends and family would be in dire need of news from my life, and that the best way to communicate these exciting happenings was a blog.  Kind of a one-size-fits all thing, like those annoying emails you get from friends who went abroad for the summer that all read, "Europe is sooooo beautiful!! and the people here are soooo cool and like Americans!!!!  oh, and the beer is cheap so I have to go now!  Hope your summer is awesome!" and so on.  I'll try to make the blog better than the summer abroad emails.

      In the spirit of spending yet another lunch break blogging, and in light of a lack of exciting events in my life in the past 24 hours, these are the random things I’ve been thinking about lately.  1.	I heard a commercial on the radio yesterday for 8-oz cans of Coors Light.  Whose dumbass idea was this?  Why would anyone want *less* beer?  It’s being touted as “faster and colder” but I say anyone who can’t finish a 12-oz brew before it gets hot doesn’t need to be drinking beer anyway.  This just proves that Coors Light is for pussies.  2.	There is a sign I see every day in Cleburne that reads, “50% of our best!”  I’m guessing that before the storms blew away one of their f’s it referred to a sale, but now it’s more like caveat emptor.  I think we should get one in front of our office.    3.	I saw a very pretty, mature 6-point buck on my way to work this morning.  For a minute, I reconsidered my post-Bambi incident (see  The Deer Whisperer )vow to not shoot deer anymore.  But I’m sticking with it.  Plus, it’s always cold during deer season, and I’d rather be indoors watching football.   4.	Liberty dressing.  Last weekend at home Mom bought “Finally, American” salad dressing.  It actually says on the label “Not French, Italian or Russian!”  It tasted like water.    That’s all for now.  If anyone wants to call Arizona law and ask how their waitlist-ranking process is going, their phone number is 520.621.1373.  I think they recognize my voice now and I don’t want to piss off anyone who’s near my file.

      In the past several weeks, I have cut back on my wine intake, almost stopped eating fried things, and opted for light beer when I could stand it.  This means I lost a few pounds, always a welcome event.  As a reward to myself for this achievement, I spent entirely too much money on an hourglass-shaped dress for the wedding I attended last weekend (I strongly believe in the reward/reward system: rewards for good things, rewards as a salve for bad things).  The dress was not exceptionally snug anywhere except at its fashionably-belted waist, where I’m approximating that it measured 27 inches.  Actually, that would be physically impossible, but I know it was very small.  It was eminently doable, though, and looked quite nice.    Unfortunately, when I arrived at my mom’s house on Thursday night I went on a freak eating binge, consuming somewhere near 10,000 calories in the 48 hours pre-wedding.  This meant that my already-form-fitting dress was impossible for me to zip up on Saturday afternoon.  I enlisted Mom’s help, insisting that the dress fit, it just needed a little extra pressure at the midpoint.  When she had trouble, I stomped off to do it myself.  In my zeal to zip the dress, I managed to tear the zipper away from the fabric.    Luckily for me, Mom’s sewing skills are better than I remembered them being, and she said that she thought it was salvageable.    The event ended with me holding on to the piano, exhaling forcefully like Scarlett O’Hara getting corseted for the ball at Twelve Oaks, and Mom/Mamie sewing me into the dress.  I was a little nervous that the stitches would give out at midnight, like Cinderella, or that I would drink too much and forget to maintain good posture, causing a scene like when Eddie Murphy's skinny-potion ran out in The Nutty Professor.  Once everything was securely fastened, though, it was actually a comfortable outfit and I received more than enough compliments to make up for the fiasco. Which just goes to show, being vain isn’t as bad as it’s made out to be.

      The best way to communicate what transpired this weekend between my dad's family and I is to publish excerpts from the transcript.  As a bit of introduction, my dad and I actually get along well, because we both hate confrontation, so our conversations are those of people who know each other a little and are catching up.  Talking to my stepmother is like having lunch with Linda Tripp.  She's very sweet and nice, but the whole time you feel like she's gathering information to use against you at your federal deposition.  Parts of the conversation where an offer of financial aid or family-sponsored travel could easily be extended are in bold.  After gushing greetings and hugs, with comments on both sides about how great we all look:  Stepmom:  So, when you go to law school, will that be full-time?  Me:  Yes.  Stepmom: [not because she cares, but because] my health insurance will let me keep you on for free as long as you're full-time.  Great!  [Now she don't feel so guilty about spending my college fund on vacations and luxury vehicles!]  Dad:  Are you still wait-listed at Arizona?  Isn't that where you really want to go?  Me:   Yes, but I've put down so many deposits at Kansas that I'm not sure I could afford to switch this late in the game.  Even though I'd love to attend Arizona, and it's a better law school and much more suited to the type of law I want to practice.   Awkward silence.  SM:  So, your Dad and I are going to Ruidoso this weekend!  Me:  Wow!  That sounds like fun.  Dad:  Yeah, you know, we went skiing five or six times last winter and the house [that belongs to his crooked lawyer friend] is so great, we just can't stay away!  SM:  Well, she knows that.  Randa's been to the house, Dad.  Haven't you?  Me:  No.  [I've been invited twice in six years, both times at New Year's Eve, a holiday I cannot imagine spending cooped up with people who don't really like me.]  SM:  Oh, I thought you had.  You'll have to go with us one weekend.  I'm sure you already have plans for the 4th, or I'd ask you to come this time.    Me: [I almost said I didn't have plans, just for fun, but let it drop]  That sounds great!   Dad: [smoothly almost changing the subject]  I'm just glad that we can drive to Ruidoso.  I don't think I'll ever be comfortable flying.  But you do see some interesting people on airplanes.  Remember when we took Randa's little brother and all of his buddies to Las Vegas?  I sat by Pat Knight, Bobby Knight's little brother.    Me:   That's awesome.  I've never been to Vegas, but it's on my list of places to visit.   SM:  Oh, you'd love it.  We had so much fun,  we're going back again later this year .  Dad:   After we take that cruise .  ...  Later, the conversation shifted to my personal life.  SM:  So, are you still dating Terry?  Me:  No, we split up.  [No further information was offered because this is not a subject I want to discuss.]  SM:  Oh, what happened?  Me:  Um, we just didn't work out.  SM:  Was it because you're going to law school far away?  Me:  Um, partly, I guess.  [at this point I'm not making eye contact and am trying to remember all of the body language I know for "not a conversation I want to pursue"]  SM:  But I bet you guys are still friends, right?  Me:  [we're not, but if I say yes maybe she'll stop]  Uh-huh.  SM:  You two weren't really that serious anyway.  [We dated exclusively for over two years.  I thought we would get married eventually.]  Me:  No, not really [desperately thinking of something else to talk about].  SM:  Well, cousin one's husband is working on his doctorate at U of Georgia, since he's some engineering boy genius, and cousin two's husband is wildly successful at whatever he does, and cousin three's husband is taking her to Paris for ten days, and cousin four is dating an incredibly handsome athlete, and cousin five...  Me:  How wonderful for all of them.  [remembering why I came.]  Hey Dad, want your Father's Day gift?  Dad:  Sure!    [I present the cigars, to many appreciative noises.  At least that part was a success.  Unfortunately, it inspired another travel story.]  SM:  You know, I tried to bring in some rum from [some Caribbean island] and they wouldn't let me!  They said you could only have a liter!  Me:  I think that's all you can transport, but just don't declare it next time.  SM:  Well, that's what I did last time, when we went down to Old Mexico.  The shopping down there was *not* what I expected, ewwww. [apparently, she thought Del Rio was Spanish for Saks Fifth Avenue].  Me:  It's definitely a niche market.  You know, pottery, handmade glassware, silver jewelry.  SM:  Dad, are you going to take Randa to see your mom [who hates me and is the reason I changed my last name]?  Dad:  Ummm [he knows this is not a good idea], I'm not sure if they're home.  SM:  Well, just go over there and leave a note if they're not home.  Dad:  [looking nervously at me]  I guess we can do that.  We won't stay long, I've got to get to [somewhere he made up].  Me:  Sure, I'd love to see her.  We drive the four blocks to his mother's house.  Effusive greetings.  For some reason, my ex-grandmother decides to pick on my dad instead of me.  A big reason I refer to her as such is because she thinks my parents were never married, since they didn't have a Catholic wedding, and I am therefore illegitimate (they were married almost two years before I came along, so unless I am a pachyderm, I'm pretty sure I was conceived in wedlock).  Also, did I mention she's very Catholic?  Catholicism is one of the denominations which I actually appreciate, but I have a big problem w/ the Church's stances on reproductive rights and therefore couldn't convert to please this crazy lady.    [Basic law school discussion, then:]  Dad:  Well, you're wanting to prosecute, right?  Me:  Yes, that's the best way to get courtroom experience and make contacts right out of law school.  I might not have a Lexus for a few years, because you don't make a lot of money at the DA's office, but that's okay.  Dad:  Well, I have a Lexus and I didn't have to go to law school!  GM:  That's because you only have two children.  We had six kids.  [Yes, I think my dad is aware of how many siblings he has.]  Dad:  I didn't want any more kids.  GM:  No, you wanted a Lexus.  [Actually, SM wanted the Lexus.  Dad is a Chevrolet man.]  Dad:  Um, yeah, I guess so.    GM:  [for good measure] We chose to have a big family instead of nice cars. [Did I mention she's Catholic?]  Awkward silence.  Me, to Grandad:  How do you think Stenholm's going to do?  Conversation about Charlie Stenholm's re-election chances in District 17.  Approval of our Congressman is one thing I share with my dad's parents.  Just as my grandfather and I get fairly involved in our political conversation:  GM:  Who's seen  The Notebook ? [unable to not be the center of attention, she rambles about the latest Nicolas Sparks bestseller-turned-movie.]  Conversation turns to politics of guns and Michael Moore.  Me:  I really didn't like Bowling for Columbine.  GD:  No, I don't like Michael Moore.  His methods bother me.    Me:  Did you know Kansas doesn't allow concealed carry?  I'm not sure what I'll do about carrying my pistol--it's either break the law or be unarmed.  GM:  Well, have you ever had to use your handgun?  Me:  No, GM, I've never shot anyone.  GM:  Oh, that's not what I meant [said as if that's exactly what she meant].  Just, do you really think you need it?  Me:  Well, the point of having one is that you hope you never need it, but if you should, it's there.    GM:  [authoritatively]  If you're going to be a LAWyer, I guess you out to obey the LAW.    Me:  [bites tongue]  Dad:  So, how was your latest trip?  [they have a giant RV that they take all of the grandchildren except me on cross-country trips in].  Conversation about trip to the nation's capital.  Dad, mercifully, cut the visit fairly short.  We part ways in the driveway. ---------------- After reading all of this, I think a little clarification is in order.  My relationship with my father has always been weird, and it's honestly both of our faults.  I never made a real effort to get to know him or be the kind of daughter he wanted when I was younger, and he never made a real effort to be around or get to know what kind of daughter I actually was.  We were--and still are--very "Cat's in the Cradle."  I found it impossible to have no relationship with him at all, because he wasn't a "bad" father--he wasn't a drug addict, always paid child support, pillar of the community, etc.  He just wasn't there.    He has made some mistakes that are unforgivable, in my mind, and for that I want to hate him, but he's not inherently a bad person, and for that reason I can't.  Plus, he's half of my genetic makeup, and the older I get the more I spot traits of his (good and bad) in myself.  So I spend my time alternating between feelings of ambivalence and/or resentment of the situation and feelings of intense loyalty and protectiveness.  My stepmother is younger than him, and he is husband #3 for her (she was 26 when they married about 12-13 years ago).  She definitely likes nice things, and after it was discovered that she was sleeping with her boss, she spent several years not working, playing golf, tennis and sunning at the country club.  For that reason (combined with the fact that she is spending my potential inheritance on Lexii and vacations), I cannot bring myself to like her, out of some protective instinct I have for my dad's well-being.  I know he chose to stay with her, and I know that they might have worked their marital problems out and it's none of my business, but I still dwell on it.  Hopefully he doesn't.  My grandmother is a different story.  I understand that it must be difficult to see a spitting image of the heathen Protestant who dragged your son away (in case that's unclear, I bear a striking resemblance to my mother).  But let's all grow up and stop hating me because of some decades-old mutual dislike harbored by my mom's family and my dad's (this dislike has progressed into severe distaste in the past couple of decades, which is fodder for another blog entry).  Several years ago, on one of my forced visits to her house, she said, "Oh, let me show you something!"  She came back with a framed 11X14 of all fifty or so relatives, including all twenty-plus grandchildren.  "It's the Vestal family portrait!  Isn't it great?"    I had not been invited to participate in this "family portrait."  It was this day, several years ago, when I made an immediate and certain decision to change my surname and never again claim I was related to this woman.  I knew it would be difficult for everyone involved (except her), but I'm still glad I did it.    My dad and I have cautiously ignored all of these things and can be quite civil most of the time.  If we disagree on something, we simply don't discuss it.  And if we have a few drinks, we can almost bond.

      For the rest of the week, my titles will reflect my countdown of hours until I no longer have to deal with negative energy in my workplace.  Kind of like a Keifer Sutherland TV series, only with promissory notes and credit reports instead of dirty bombs and hostage situations.  I have a confession to make.  I have the maturity level of a prepubescent boy, which many of you know already.  This was confirmed by my inability to not snicker when certain professors discussed religious “sects” and especially when anyone referred to the “oral section” of a test, despite my being a college graduate and presumable adult.  I also cannot make it through a discussion about the erection of a building.   This sense of humor makes it difficult for me to complete my “Time and Attendance” paperwork at the USDA, due every pay period, since everyone refers to this form as “your T and A.”  The most humorless of employees will ask, “Have you got your T&A?” with no hint of irony, and I can just barely contain myself.  I mean, has no one in the higher levels of bureaucracy noticed this?  There are plenty of non-funny alternatives.  Attendance and Time comes to mind, and I’m sure there are plenty of other semantic shifts that would prevent possible misinterpretations.    Of course, I could just grow up.

      I love misnomers.  I passed a sign on my lunch break that advertised "Natural Mosquito Products."  Now, I'm sure they meant mosquito-repelling products and just didn't have enough clear plastic letters for the sign, but the possibilities are endless.  Handmade mosquito-wing apparel?  Packaged itchy spots?  A malaria vaccine?  Baby mosquitos?  Tiny straws?  I've been torturing myself about feeling excited that a co-worker will be taking medical leave for a month soon.  After today, I no longer harbor these feelings of guilt.  I will enjoy every day without the running soundtrack of bitches and moans and not consider myself a bad person.  I will also be keeping a running counter of the days until there is no one across the office from me.    As of today:  6 working days (not counting today) until I work in a happy, healthy environment.  That doesn't seem like so much until you consider the fact that I work 10-hour days.  I think I'll do an hourly countdown instead.    63 hours until I am no longer in danger of becoming a disgruntled worker.

      It's amazing how much work I can get done in such a short time when my email isn't working.  But even Baylor's crappy servers can't keep me from wasting time by blogging.    Actually, I am having a doughnut break, which is not officially included in my "I'm going to eat seven fruits and vegetables a day" plan, but it does have cinnamon on it, which is from a plant, soooo...  Yesterday when I got home from work (at the ungodly hour of 7:30pm), I opened the garage door and poor Rico came streaking in the house.  Rico is my cat, in case anyone thinks I keep a naked yard boy in the garage during the day.  He was sweaty, if cats can get that way; I'm assuming from the humidity in the garage.  God knows how long the poor thing was in there; he looked 3 pounds lighter than his normal 12 pound self.  I tried really hard to show him how sorry I was that he had been stuck in the garage, even though I'm pretty sure I had nothing to do with it, but he insisted on antagonizing me the rest of the night.  See, Rico is a bipolar schizophrenic.  I know that's an odd diagnosis for a cat, but I'm certain of it.  He is 10 months old, enormous, and very pretty.  Which is good, because his personality leaves much to be desired.  Some days he will be waiting for me when I wake up, like a puppy, and rub against my legs while I get ready for work.  These days he'll let me pick him up, purr, and generally act like a normal cat.  Other days, I will pick him up and he immediately growls, cries, and acts as though I've tried to scalp him.  He runs away if I get near him and bites--very hard--if I try to pet him.  Some days, he'll do half and half:  when I wake up, he's sitting outside of my door to greet me and immediately begins purring.  I'll pick him up, scratch his head for a minute, and then he'll look at me with an expression of pure hate, bite me, and run away.  Can veterinarians prescribe lithium?  In other news, I have yet another out of town wedding to attend this weekend.  This will be my third in five weeks.  Talk about having the feeling of "always a bridesmaid" drilled into your head.  Except I'm not in the wedding party, so maybe it should be "always a reception guest" syndrome.  Which, when you think about it, isn't all bad.  I get to dress up, eat wedding cake, and drink prodigiously for free.  I just wish people would get married closer to my house.  Also on my agenda for this weekend is trading passive-aggressive barbs with my dad, always an entertaining evening.  I skipped Father's Day out of rebelliousness and immediately felt like a horrible person, so I called Monday and offered to take him out to dinner this weekend.  We will spend a few hours discussing why I have not yet accomplished anything worth talking about, all of the vacations that my stepmother and he are going to take other family members on, and the personal and professional achievements of all of my cousins.  At some point in the conversation I will be compared to my mother, which is a compliment in my mind and not one in his.  I will do my best to get in a few guilt-inspiring comments, possibly regarding his lack of appreciation for what I have managed to do with my life so far, and if I'm really feeling frisky I will mention how much I need a vacation, just so I can see how he avoids asking me to go on one with them.  And of course, if he does offer I'll decline, just to make things more complicated.  I'll give him his Father's Day gift, of which I'm actually very proud.  I smuggled a few Cuban cigars home the last time I was in Mexico, and I figured he could use a couple.  Nothing says love like illegal goods from Latin America.  Then we'll part ways, say how much we love and miss each other, and I'll go drink until I forget the whole encounter.    I know why my cat is crazy.  He inherited it from me.

      A note on the post below--if you're not interested in the politics of gun ownership, it will probably be horribly boring.  It might be even if you are.  But hey, this is my blog and I can post whatever I want.  Just a warning.

      In  Bowling for Columbine , Michael Moore adds a witty, entertaining commentary to the national conversation regarding the second amendment and violence in our society.  Unfortunately, many of Moore's conclusions are based on flawed logic and his most pointed criticisms are simply passionate rhetoric.    The first significant interview is the first sign that Moore's investigative techniques are questionable.  In depicting America's "gun culture," he interviews members of the Michigan militia and Terry Nichols, who was acquitted in the Oklahoma City bombing trials.  These interviews, which Moore's voice-overs portray as emblematic of every gun owner in America, are as representative of gun owners as the ten o'clock news interviews of the redneck whose trailer was blown away by the tornado.   "It was pandelerium..."  Trust me, there are plenty of less radical, noncriminal, educated advocates of the second amendment in this country.  You're reading one of them.  Moore then accuses the NRA of insensitivity for holding a regularly-scheduled annual meeting in Littlefield, Colorado not long after the Columbine shootings.  While I'm sure that some people did object deeply and sincerely to the NRA gathering in Littlefield, I think that these people would have protested the NRA gathering whether or not such a tragic event had just occurred.  Does anyone remember  Nazis in Skokie ?  Let us not forget that unpopular points of view have an especially protected place in this society.  Even so, from the looks of the footage, the NRA rally was a fairly popular event that year, even after the events at Columbine High School.  In the same segment on Columbine, Moore insinuates that because Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest weapons manufacturer, has a major plant in Littlefield, the children of Littlefield were subliminally desensitized to weapons.  Now, there is a massive Trane factory just west of Waco, but I don't feel the uncontrollable urge to keep my home refrigerated to 60 degrees.  This line of thinking is really a stretch, especially when you consider the types of weapons made by Lockheed Martin.  Defensive missiles in no way resemble the handguns Moore so despises, they are transported on average-looking trailors that could be carrying anything, from steel to sand, and it is highly doubtful that any of Littlefield's impressionable children are hanging out by the plant, hoping for a glipse of the latest in national security mechanisms.  At this point, Moore interviews Marilyn Manson, a heavy metal performer.  Manson was asked not to conduct his scheduled concert in Colorado after Columbine because it was thought by many that his music influenced the killers.  Manson had the most relevant observation I have heard to date regarding our violent culture, and one that Moore, to his credit, examines in detail later in the movie.  The proposition is that our acceptance of violence stems from the behaviors of our government, which in postmodern society is as paternal a figure as any.  When torture and preemptive invasions are not only condoned but supported by many citizens, that can definitely translate into an acceptance of violence as commonplace and even useful.    Unfortunately, Moore veers off into conspiracy theories and gross generalizations about gun owners.  His emphasis on the NRA's opposition to an assault weapons ban ignores the fact that what the majority of NRA members oppose is loosely-worded legislation which would allow for restrictive registration or even confiscation of more common models, like hunting rifles, shotguns, and pistols carried for self-defense.  These regular citizens rely on the policy wonks and lobbyists at the national level of the NRA to prevent such legislation, in the same manner that is utilized by nearly every interest group in the nation.   The nuances of policymaking are not accurate indicators of the views of a organization as large and diverse as the NRA.  Despite the bias of the picture, which I had expected and even welcomed at times, the first real surprise I experienced was when Moore tried to compare the raw numbers of gun deaths in the U.S. with the numbers of other free world countries.  By not using the numbers per capita, Moore blatantly twists the facts for shock value.  Reporting with a bias is one thing, but deliberately misprepesenting facts is another.  A second example of this is his linking of the KKK and the NRA in 1871, a tenuous relationship at best.  Moore uses this same ridiculous reasoning to link the fear of "Africanized" bees to racial tensions.    By the midpoint of the film, I was riled up and taking notes.  It was at this juncture that Moore thankfully focused on two issues that are valid.  First, he notes the exaggeration of gun violence by the media in areas mostly inhabited by minorities, like South Central Los Angeles.  Moore documents that while television cameras chase any report of a drawn gun, they ignore the pollution that obscures the view of the Hollywood letters.  He also pursues the issue of petty misdemeanors receiving more coverage than massive corporate corruption on popular TV shows like  Cops .  Both of these phenomena deserve much more attention than Moore gives them, but he is one of the first to broach the subject in such terms.  Moore returns to the idea of the state cultivating a culture of fear, and charmingly interviews some flunky Canadian teenagers.  They are skipping school and believe that the U.S. is "just mean," which is why there is so much more violent crime here.  While funny, these Canadian interviews do nothing to support the thesis that citizens can be desensitized by the actions of their political leaders.  This assertion should have been explored in significantly more depth and would have made an excellent main theme for the segment, instead of the sensationalization of isolated gun-related incidents.  Moore also had an excellent chance to link the influence of the state when he began citing the large number of guns which exist in private homes in Canada, but he chose instead to segue into contrasting its low amount of violent crime with that in the U.S.  This comparison continues without seriously engaging the roots of each nation's crime rate.  The ominous voice-over repeats the adage of "If guns made people safer, the U.S. would be the safest nation in the world, but it's not..."  This statement creates a slippery slope which has no supporting evidence, destroying the argument which Moore had begun exploring earlier.    Finally, Moore's cornering of Charlton Heston in Heston's home cemented my opinion of this film as merely an appeal to emotion, rather than a reasoned approach supported by logical arguments and facts.  By attacking  ad hominem  the man that most of the nation identifies with gun rights, Moore does a great injustice to his own valid arguments.  His representation of the views of the NRA, gun owners in general, and in a broader sense all advocates of individual liberty devalue his argument regarding Glassner's culture of fear theory, one in which many of the former groups might join him if he avoided such alienating rhetoric.    The precept of individual autonomy in matters of life and death, which is so inherently carved into our collective identity, is the very one which protects the second amendment just as equally as it does the first, fourth, fifth and eighth.  While I welcome and encourage dialogue on the subject of the right to bear arms as a civil liberty on par with freedom of speech and religious liberty, Moore's fallacious arguments and rhetorical grandstanding do nothing to further this vital, relevant conversation.  The best I can hope for is that by voicing my distaste of the film, I can inspire other liberal-minded indiviudals to reconsider their opinions of the second amendment and if not that, at least to realize Moore's faulty assertions are just that--false, inaccurate, and misleading.

      I was so thrilled to get to leave work at 5:00, I was certain nothing could dim my spirits.  Little did I know, there would be a massive traffic accident in Whitney, pop. 2000, involving a combine and several other vehicles.  Traffic was backed up for miles, with no verifiable information on what was going on.  I mean, it's Whitney, it's not like Zack and Jim are updating the traffic every 15 minutes on alternate routes for Farm to Market Road 933.    Lest you think I am a completely heinous bitch, I did sit in silence for several minutes out of respect and concern for anyone who might be injured up ahead.  But after a while I was unable to contain my irritation with being passed on the shoulder almost constantly while patiently waiting my turn to go through the scene of the accident.  I pulled over, passed several people on the shoulder, and joined the alternate-route seekers in what quickly became a very bad idea.    There aren't really any alternate routes through Whitney, and I know about zero of them.  Luckily for me, two helpful gentlemen had come off of their porch to guide the out-of-towners back to the highway.  They could have been brothers, or cousins, or maybe each other's uncle, I'm really not sure.  They shared the same haircut--shaved on top with a six-inch tail in the back, sticking out of a trucker cap--and the same penchant for giving directions.  It went something like this:  Uncle/Dad: "You gotta go back this way, see, then turn around, and, uh, and go that way, and then you'll turn, um, yeah, turn and go over there, uh-huh, go over, uh, thataway and then you'll get back on the highway."  Dad/Uncle: "No, stupid, you gotta tell her which *way* to turn.  See, ma'am, you go this way (undistinguishable hand motion) and then go, uhhh, ummm, right, then go over here (another ambiguous gesture) then turn around and, that'll put you back on the highway."  Me:  "Oh, okay."    I decided to go with my handy built-in compass and just travel in the general direction of Waco, which actually got me to the highway fairly quickly.   You know how once your frustration stores have been tapped, everything else that annoyed you that day comes rushing back?  Well, it happens to me.  So while I was driving around lost in Whitney, I had a chance to ruminate on various things that caused my blood pressure to rise today.    1.  If I hear one more country song telling me I'm not a good American because I don't think our presence in Iraq is justified, I'm going to swear off country music forever.  2.  I can't stand that new rock song about "I found a reason for me...and it's you."  Get a life, dude.  This really wouldn't bother me so much if it wasn't simultaneously on three out of the six radio stations that I can get en route to work and back.  And two of the others are playing Manichean country ballads.  3.  A rather overweight co-worker informed me this morning that the fat-free, 80-calorie smoothie I was having was "full of carbs" and therefore "would just turn right into fat."  Now, I'm not Kate Moss's body double, but neither am I facing knee surgery in the upcoming months due to the strain of carting my oversized body around.  The moral here is those who live in fat houses should not throw diet advice.    4.  That was mean.  Lord, I apologize.  5.  Actually, I might be a little sensitive about the weight thing because this morning I hopped onto Coby's fancy digital scale, and all it said was "L".  What does that mean?  Lardass?  Lightweight?  I need more specificity from my scales, dammit.  After re-reading this post, it's probably a good thing we moved Wine Tasting Wednesday up to Tuesdays.  I'm going to need it this week.

      How to tell that you had too much fun Saturday night:  your companion for the evening asks you if you remember salsa dancing.  You do not.  That's right, folks, in my zeal to recover from the bug I fought all week, I drank too much and ended up (allegedly) being the life of a Mexican wedding reception.  To which I was not invited.  I'm sure everyone is shocked, just shocked, that I would behave in such a way, but I have to say that the parts of the night that I remember are really entertaining.  Those would include:  Losing $16 at the horse races, and winning back $3.20, my first-ever pony purse.  Drinking lots of $1 beer at said horse races.    Relieving myself in the bushes outside of Pappadeaux, because it just seemed too far to walk inside like a civilized person.  At this point it is still daylight.  Getting cut off at Pappadeaux, and then trying to sneak a bottle of wine that I procured at the bar back to our table, like a 17-year-old spiking the punch at prom.  It didn't work; our manager was more clever than he appeared.  I think I asked our waiter for his phone number.    Wisely deciding that we should not leave the Holiday Inn to continue our debauchery; luckily, there was an enormous wedding as well as a class reunion in the hotel.  After cheap beer at the races and expensive wine at dinner (though not the quantity I would have liked), the only reasonable thing to do was drink massive amounts of Alabama Slammers, which contain mainly Southern Comfort and something pink.    At this point, things are a little fuzzy.  I do remember asking for nachos, being told that they were out of nachos, but here, have another Slammer instead!  Thanks, Tony.    I remember arguing about what  urlLink ceviche  meant (I was right), telling everyone that I wanted to sleep with Charlize Theron, and successfully dancing to Amarillo by Morning.    Rumor has it that, after all of this excitement, I also tried to out-salsa the reception attendees and managed to fall on my ass no less than four times, to the delight of everyone in the bar.  Needless to say, I will not be darkening the door of the Holiday Inn in Grand Prairie anytime soon.  My next clear memory is waking up about 9 with an intense desire to empty my stomach.   Alabama Slammers are not as tasty the second time around, guys.  And this is the not the first time they have worked their evil magic on my digestive system.  You think I'd learn my lesson...

      As some of you have noticed, I haven't been exactly communicative lately.  This is because I have been asleep for approximately 60% of the past few days.  See, Wednesday I stayed home from work with a sore throat and mild hangover.  I figured that the two were maybe a little related, but when my throat didn't feel better by that afternoon, I made a visit to the Baylor Medical Center (completely different from its more prestigious and accurate cousin in the Metroplex).  They assured me that I did not have strep throat, or anything, for that matter, and sent me on my merry way.  Yesterday, after returning to work, I came home so exhausted that I fell asleep at 8pm.  When I woke up at 12:30 this afternoon, I had a message from the Baylor Medical Center confirming two of my suspicions:  first, that I do, in fact, have strep throat, and second, that they are a bunch of idiots.  My first thought was, who the fuck gets strep throat in June?  I've always associated being sick with winter, since it's the crappiest season anyway, and plus when I was a kid I always had strep throat when it was cold.  I just guessed that germs love inclement weather.  Then I figured out that I probably got sick from my non-illness related visit to the doctor last Friday, where I shared a waiting room with lots of little snot-nosed kids who breathed all around me.  This reinforced two more beliefs of mine: A. I hate going to the doctor's office, and B. Nor can I stand screaming, snotty, disease-ridden children.    So I drove *back* to campus to pick up some drugs, which will allegedly make me feel good enough to go back to work Monday, but not good enough to float the river tomorrow.  Damn.  But leaving the house was a good thing, because I took the long way home and picked up some of the mother of all comfort foods, Taco Bueno.  It doesn't matter what you order, it's all excellent.  Plus, since my appetite has been nonexistent the past couple of days, I'm going to look at this as a weight-loss opportunity (everyone knows that calories from Taco Bueno don't count).  However, I decided that no matter how sick I am, I'm still glad that I'm not Sabrina this weekend.  Because while I lay on the couch and whine, eat greasy Mexican food, and watch the Law and Order marathon that's on USA, she's completing her warp-speed thesis to turn in Tuesday.  Sending good thesising vibes her direction...

      Inspired by the latest church-state Supreme Court decision, I wrote about 10 pages of thesis last night.  No prospectus yet, but I'm thinking about naming chapter 4 "The Rehnquist Court:  No-Talent Ass Clowns."  I spent a good twenty minutes of my drive this morning debating between Ass Monkeys and Ass Clowns, using at least as much intellectual effort as the Court itself must have in rendering the Newdow decision.    Since I'm probably the only person nerdy enough to have read the whole opinion last night, I'll give you the high points:  the vast majority of it focuses on Newdow's custody battle, making a church-state issue into one of parental rights.  Which is ridiculous, as Newdow has physical custody of his daughter almost ten months out of the year, and she's a minor, making her opinion relatively irrelevant per previous church-state and other decisions.  The mother, however, had been granted "sole legal custody" of the child, allowing her to make educational and religious decisions regarding the minor.  Granted, as a parental-rights issue, it appears that the mother has a valid claim.  This opinion, however, gives substantial importance to the fact that the daughter was fairly apathetic regarding the Pledge (not surprising, considering she was five years old when the suit was filed).  The implications of taking the juvenile daughter's wishes into account are far-reaching, especially in cases involving medical treatment and religious free exercise.    Stevens essentially broadened the necessary criteria for standing beyond parents to include the minors in their care as autonomous individuals, something relatively unprecedented, especially to this degree.  Consider the implications of a case involving Jehovah's Witnesses where the parents wanted to withhold medical treatment but the child, say, a six-year-old, was insistent on receiving a blood transfusion.  Prior precedent states that the decision (odd as the situation seems, it's the best I can do right now) would ultimately rest with the parents.  Based on Newdow, there could be some serious conflicting interests.  Do parents have a right to prevent their children from doing something which would, per their belief system, damn their souls?  What if the situation involved Hindu children who were allowed meat at their elementary school?  Do the parents decide what their children are served in order to comply with their religious beliefs, or should the children choose?  I'm not answering any of these questions here, but it looks to me like a supremely big bucket of worms regarding parental rights and the autonomy of minors has just been opened.    Not satisfied to only sign his name to an opinion, Rehnquist's concurring drivel focuses, of course, on the historical/traditional argument of ceremonial deism, for example: the  fourth  verse of "The Star-Spangled Banner," mentions that "in God is our trust!" (my copy of the opinion doesn't have page numbers yet, but this tidbit of wisdom can be found a few paragraphs above footnote 4). And of course, all schoolchildren not only know all the words to the fucking  fourth  verse of the national anthem, but are also forced to recite them daily in public schools, right, Rehnie?  Because that would really make this argument hold water.  As a sidenote, big props to Scalia for recusing himself.    I could go on for days, but I'll spare you my separatist rants.  I will say this is the most pussified set of justices since the White Court upheld the Espionage Act during WWI, cowering in their robes after a few of them were accused of being--gasp--"activist judges" and for not recognizing that constitutional protections go out the window when we're at war,  hello!   Jesus Christ, the reason these guys have lifetime appointments is so they can render decisions without pandering to popular opinion or right-wing (or, less likely, left-wing) administrations.  The upside to all of this is that it reinforced my conviction that I have stumbled onto an area in which I can be completely entertained for 80+ hours weekly.  In light of my recent foray into bachelorette-hood (and not the academic kind), my prospects for getting married and breeding are looking more and more dismal.  It's a good thing I have a fallback plan, i.e. workaholic religious liberty attorney.    And to think, I was going to blog today about how Bowling for Columbine pissed me off.

      Thanks for the well-wishes, you two.  I would like to clarify some misconceptions in each of your emails before I go into detail about how untangling hair from stitches is just as gut-wrenching as it sounds.    First, I didn't mention the appointment because I didn't want Wine Tasting Wednesday to focus on my own physical shortcomings (i.e., odd neck-lump) instead of what it should be focused on:  elective surgery, Reagan's legacy, strangers from the Midwest, and second amendment rights.  Not because I am some Rumsfield-school-of-secrecy graduate (this was implied by Brina).    Second, the Reaganomics day off was not a lie (as implied by Michele).  Since Friday, the national day of mourning, was my regularly scheduled day off, the feds gave me 8 hours of vacation time to use, so that I would be even with all of my co-workers and not feel discriminated against for having Friday off.  I picked Thursday, due to its proximity to Wednesday night, and also because I was probably just going to call in sick otherwise.    Finally, I know that you both would have been more than willing to nurse me back to health, if I had asked.  However, I'm a very bad patient, which is why I didn't want any post-op nursing.  Even my own mother dreads taking care of me when sick, so I wouldn't wish my demanding nature on either of you two accommodators  (accommodators in the sense of catering to the needs of others, not the Esbeck definition).  Luckily for Jaimee and Coby, they've both been out of the house quite a bit, which means I can't boss them around either.  I've caught up on lots of non-academic reading, re-organized my planner (even on Vicodin, I'm still OCD), and watched lots of Law and Order.  It's actually been a nice little drug-hazed vacation.  Speaking of drugs, since I handled the stitches so bravely after the local anesthetic wore off, my doctor decided I have a high tolerance for pain and would therefore only be needing a day's worth of painkillers.  If I hadn't been so woozy, I would have explained that I didn't cry and thrash when he was stitching me up because I'm too proud to degrade myself in front of two highly trained medical professionals, not because I have some superhuman ability to bear foreign objects under my skin.    Luckily, I keep a stash of Vicodin from my last medical adventure (spider bite) handy at home, in case I need a bikini wax or something similarly excruciating.  It's about time that came in handy for something besides sleeping cocktails.

      In my quest to find acceptable faith-based and non-profit organizations for the government to partner with, I stumbled on  urlLink this  website.  It actually has some really interesting info (and a huge amount of it), but on first glance, it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.    There was a headline from Jerry Falwell about his hero, Reagan, right above a Cal Thomas article on how Reagan made religious conservatives compromise their core beliefs.  There were also articles on Dennis Quaid as Noah, the breakup of Creed, and the Rapture's links to Harry Potter.    The kicker was a dating service called Soulmatch that will take into account your value system before pairing you off with someone.    Instead of meeting a fellow confused soul, I chose to take a quiz, in the same format as those "Which  Punky Brewster  character are you?" ones.   What's Your Spiritual Type?     You scored 45, on a scale of 25 to 100. Here's how to interpret your score:   40 - 49   Active Spiritual Seeker – Spiritual but turned off by organized religion   urlLink Which Spiritual Type Are You?

      Another wedding in Abilene, another drive to Cleburne at 4:30AM on Monday morning.  Such is life, in the past few weeks.    Going home lately has been really great, despite my gripes about the drive and the weather.  I've gotten to catch up with some folks that I probably neglected over the past few years, and it's nice to remember some people will let you desert them for a relationship they told you would not work and still love you when you come crawling back.    One of my best friends got married this weekend; he's the first of our group to actually tie the knot.  I felt like a mother hen all weekend, petting and cooing over my "baby boy" who had grown up.  The weekend was not without its comic moments, even though I think I cried like 3 separate times.  To begin with, the groom made the mistake of staying out very, very late the night before and wasn't feeling his best during the pre-wedding prep (the ceremony was at 1PM).  The bride was in similar shape.    This was probably a good thing, because it made them less likely to notice that the preacher botched the bride's name no less than three times.  It's not an odd name, not foreign, and I'm still not sure what the problem was.  Any awkwardness at the name episode was erased, however, by the cacophony of disposable cameras being advanced every time anyone moved.  It was deafening.  Later that night (Saturday) was when I got to catch up with the childhood crowd, which includes people I've known for 15+ years.  That was really enjoyable, and I hope I get to see them all quite a bit this summer before I flee the state.  Sunday I just couldn't bring myself to get ready and drive to Waco; Mom and I ended up driving out to a barn in our pasture that has 4 baby owls living in it.  I pictured cute, hooting, fluffy creatures.  Cute and fluffy they are, but I learned that when confronted with a human, owls don't hoot.  They are capable of making the most horrifying noise known to man, a giant hissing noise that is impossibly loud for such a small, fluffy thing.  It was like being in Jurassic Park, only instead of big, ugly dinosaurs, these adorable 6-inch birds were doing the soundtrack.    They are really cute, though, and I'm sure the hissing is actually their way of showing affection.  I didn't test this theory by trying to pet them, though, just in case it was wrong.  I like all ten of my fingers.  So after the owl-watching, it was much too late to drive back to Waco for the sole purpose of waking up and driving to Cleburne.  I slept at Mom's, got up at 4 and left the house at an hour that I used to come home at.  I kind of like having the roads all to myself because then I can spend my mental energy figuring out the meaning of life and whatnot instead of concentrating on driving.    This morning, my pondering included the following:  1.  I decided that the reason the coffee at the quick stop in Cross Plains is so good is that there is rust on the coffee pot, which gives it a unique flavor.  I'm not being facetious here, it's really tasty.  2.  I also examined the disturbing trend of female country singers bragging about how trashy they are.  I heard one song about being proud to be barefoot and pregnant, and another boasting about how much whisky the singer could drink.  Now, I'm not biased against rednecks; on the contrary, my own roots make me want to disprove the "uncultured" stereotype whenever I can.  But it does bother me that these songs are teaching an entire generation of young girls that they have to choose between swigging whisky at night and then enjoying a professional, educated life during the day.  No one should have to make that choice.  I think I'll contact NOW about it.  3.  When looking for an alternative station to the trashy women, I couldn't find any NPR.  That's probably related to the demand for it in the area I was driving through.  I did find a news show, though, which was very enlightening.  It was a discussion about gay marriage, and since the issue interests me, I tuned in.  Within 60 seconds, the host had referred to homosexuals as "aberrants" "misfits" and, my favorite, "angels of Satan."  I resorted to a CD and amused myself by counting the number of times Glen Rose businesses associate themselves with dinosaurs, even if there is no plausible relation between the two.  And here I am, wasting my lunch hour blogging.  While I was spending my weekend sleeping, eating and drinking, my first political hero passed away.  When I was younger, I was a gun-toting, freedom-loving conservative.  I saw Reagan as a larger-than-life figure, like Tom Landry or Davy Crockett.  After a few years of higher education, seeing a budget surplus disappear, and seeing friends fighting an unjust war, I have become a gun-toting, freedom-loving liberal.  I'm still sad about Reagan, if only because to me he represented an era of less animosity in politics.  He could joke and laugh and make people like him, even if they vehemently disagreed with his policies.  We've lost that today.  So here's to Ronnie, even though he ushered in the right wing as we know it.  It will be a long time before we see another class act like him.

      When I started this blog, I vowed that it would not become simply a record of things I did while drinking.  However, some stories just need retelling.  In the spirit of Wine Tasting Wednesdays, I did my best last night to drink too much and sleep too little on a weekday.  To start the day off right, massive storms in Cleburne had rendered the A/C in our building useless, but spared the lights.  So we could work, but in miserable conditions.  Yesterday in Cleburne was 95 with a heat index of 100 and humidity of about 200%.  I think I know what it feels like to work in a sweatshop now.  So after my ten hours of pore-cleansing steam room treatment, you can imagine how ready I was for a nice frosty beverage at everyone’s favorite establishment, the Lakeside Tavern (not to diminish the greatness of the Lake Brazos Steakhouse).  Cross Canadian Ragweed was playing and the little tavern sold out.  I felt like a parent watching their child graduate.  It was a great show and I had several random encounters with people I hadn’t seen in a while—some I was glad to see, others not so much.  The list of run-ins included my pickup salesman (good), a friend from my days in Bellmead (also good), an ex-boyfriend who is now married (odd), and another friend who is now a bartender (very good).    The rain held off until the very end of the show, but the storms were getting pretty close by dark.  I had images of the crowd getting collectively struck by lightning like the herd of cattle in Lonesome Dove.  The rest of the night included driving to Whitney in a monsoon, not believing that my passenger was actually a law enforcement official (he was), then trying very very hard not to swerve drunkenly.       I finally weenied out at about 1:30.  Ambitiously, I set my alarm for 5:00 but didn’t get up until 6:30.  My wonderful hostess had not only set the coffee pot timer for me, but had also rounded up all the makeup, hair products, and clothing I would need for today, too.  So I didn’t look as scary as I could have when I dragged into work only ten minutes late.  I would have probably been on time if I could have figured out how to get out of Cyndi's house.  I walked into the master bedroom, the garage, and two closets before giving up and going out the back door.  The air conditioner is still out, and the temperature is starting to creep up, which does not bode well for my afternoon.  I’ve spent the last 6 hours feeling like I stood up way too fast, only while sitting down.  I seriously doubt that adding heat to this equation will help.  Random tidbit:  I’m wearing a suit that is all one piece, with a sleeveless top attached to shorts.  Meaning you can’t simply remove the shorts, you have to take off the entire outfit.  When I went to the bathroom earlier, I had the unique experience of being completely undressed at work, something I’m proud to say I had never done before.  Guess I can check off office nudity on my "to do before age 30" list.

      Wow.  And I thought I'd get some good karma thrown my way for the deer incident.  I didn't even know what a Malebolge was until I found out I was banished to one!    I always thought of myself as very honest.  Maybe it's the "pandering" that got me into so much trouble.  I mean, I do want a career in politics...

      Before yesterday, I was planning on posting about how much I love going home to my mom's house and just hanging out.  It's so different there, without alarm clocks and deadlines and traffic and noise.  I can sit for hours watching kittens wrestle with each other without feeling like I'm wasting time.  I'm sure everyone has that one safe place they can always go to, and for me it's Dudley, Texas.    So yesterday, after a fun-filled weekend of weddings, pre-Memorial Day drunkenness, and Memorial Day laziness, I decided to go for a quick run, then clean up and get back to the real world.  A little over 2 miles into my run, I noticed a little furry thing in the road--it looked like a ferret.  What in the world is a ferret doing in suburbia Dudley, one might ask.  Upon closer inspection, I discovered that the "ferret" was actually a teensy fawn, curled up in a shade.    Now, growing up in the country I know several rules about cute baby animals that one might not associate with said babies.  One is, if there is a baby, somewhere there is most likely a mother.  A very protective one.  So I was a little apprehensive about hanging out by the deer, since I could picture myself trampled to death by a vicious doe and becoming Callahan County's sixth unnatural death in two weeks.  But it was late in the afternoon and deer move in the morning and late evening, and it became obvious after a little while this guy's mother wasn't coming back.    So I sat and bonded with the little guy for a while, letting him smell me, petting him and cooing in my best mama deer impression.  Soon it was a foregone conclusion--I could not leave the baby deer there to get eaten by coyotes in a few hours.  So, after some more exercises in trust, I picked him up and carried him the 2+ miles back to the house.  It was quite revealing in regards to my potential child-rearing skills, since I felt like I should comfort the fawn somehow.  But as I tried to remember lullabies all I could think of to sing to it were Merle Haggard songs, Limp Bizkit, and "Amarillo by Morning."    We finally made it home, much to Mom's chagrin.  Infant deer apparently have to be fed every 3 hours, day and night, and are considered a delicacy by her dog and a few badass cats that live there.  So we called a few people we know that raise orphan deer (you might be a redneck if you know people who raise orphaned animals...) and found a new home for the adorable thing at a cousin's house.  (You especially might be a redneck if the person who raises orphaned animals is related to you.)  Actually, my mom's cousin has been the designated orphanage for wildlife in Callahan County for a few years now.  She said last year she raised six little deer--how fun would that be?  Maybe not very much, after a few 4AM feedings, but they're almost cute enough to justify it.  She also had some squirrels and possums.  If you don't know what a possum is, consider yourself lucky.  They are the ugliest creatures alive and I can't imagine why anyone would save them.  But one cannot discriminate on appearances when saving helpless animals.    I really wanted to bring the deer to Waco with me and nurse it to all of its 12-point glory in my backyard, but I figured that in light of recent parking disputes (in which we are completely in the right, except for Coby nailing the Mustang, and he  did  pay for it), the neighbors are looking for any excuse to call the police on us.  Possession of a deer is a huge fine, kind of like having a meth lab or something, plus it would eventually be able to hop out of the yard and roam the neighborhood.  In light of this, I think it's best that we gave the deer a nice home in the country where it will be well fed every three hours by someone that is not me.   Talk about back to nature.  You just haven't lived until you've walked 2 miles in 90 degree heat holding a miniature deer in your arms.  So cute.

      I'm pretty sure my health insurance company (okay, my Dad's health insurance company; part of his Catholic guilt provides me with health coverage) is: A) involved in a racket with the US Postal Service, and B) is discriminating against clients depending on what kind of prescriptions they receive.   The first claim I base on the fact that if I sign up for their mail-in refills program, they reduce my copay by half. I think this is ridiculous. I don't like getting important things in the mail, because they tend to get lost and/or squished. Also, there is no way to verify exactly what kind of conditions mail-ordered things are handled and shipped in. I would much rather go to a nice, well-lit pharmacy and watch the little gray-haired man carefully fill my prescriptions while I scan his diplomas.   Now, the second problem I have with this insurance company is that they have raised the copay on my prescriptions, classified as "mental health" medications, three times in the past six months, from $8 a refill to $30 apiece. They say that it's because instead of being "as-needed" medicines, for example, to treat a brief case of insomnia while under a lot of stress, they are now "maintenance" prescriptions, because the insomnia doesn't seem to be going away. Now, if you ask me, the class of consumers that I would least want to irritate, much less give the perception of screwing out of excessive copays, are those who need sedatives. I mean, if you're going to fuck with people who are on drugs, why not the peaceful, nonconfrontational patients, like narcoleptics, or people who have scrips for medical marijuana? Don't piss off the people who can't sleep more than three hours nightly without mild tranquilizers&nbsp;and who tend to scream at store clerks if they don't get their fix.   Case in point: I call Target pharmacy not too long ago to verify that they had received my online refill request, and that my pills were ready to be picked up. Allegedly, they were. When I arrived, only my Ambien was ready, although I had also asked that my birth control pills and my Xanax (sweet stress-relief, for the Rx uninitiated) be refilled. They weren't, and the pharmacists took their sweet-ass time in calling another pharmacy, verifying the number of refills on my birth control pills, and performing various other tasks which were not requisite to me getting my contraceptives. After about 10 minutes, I was in need of either my correctly filled prescriptions, or at least an appetizer of Xanax. Because I was very, very close to screaming, "Just give me my goddamn birth control!" But I restrained myself, and the situation resolved itself after about 45 minutes of controlled breathing by me.   This brings me to my next topic: I am just waiting for my pharmacist to tell me that he can no longer fill my birth control pills because he has a "moral objection" to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one scene I would have no problem making in a public area (as if that's such a short list).&nbsp; Apparently, this is happening more and more in Texas, and a couple of state legislatures (not ours, yet)&nbsp;have gone so far as to pass laws allowing medical professionals to either not prescribe or not fill prescriptions for uses that are not consistent with their moral beliefs, including contraceptives. This outrages me beyond words. Apparently, a group calling itself Physicians for Life  urlLink has asserted  (with very few, if any, notable empirical academic references) that birth control pills are unacceptable to opponents of abortion, because they cause a fertilized egg to abort itself. This is NOT the way that the pill works; it prevents pregnancy by preventing ovulation, meaning that there are no eggs to be fertilized.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which means this is another misogynistic attempt by the antiabortion movement and the religious right to further squelch women's rights.&nbsp;   Now, I'm nowhere near what our buddy Rush Limbaugh likes to call a "Feminazi." I like my free drinks,&nbsp;get-out-of-speeding-tickets-free cards&nbsp;and whistles from construction workers as much as the next old-fashioned girl, but for god's sake,&nbsp;women have been getting screwed in a plethora of ways since day one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, guys, but there's no way that getting away with a few speeding tickets and having drinks bought for you because you have breasts makes up for being paid less than 80% of men's average salaries, not to mention shit like this.&nbsp;   I wonder how the pharmacists would react if the religious right demanded that they stop&nbsp;serving up&nbsp;Viagra for men who might use it in an extramarital relationship?&nbsp; Or to relax with some nice, sinful porn? &nbsp;For some reason, I just don't see that happening.&nbsp; And on the subject of male enhancement, am I the only person who is creeped out by that Enzyte guy?&nbsp;&nbsp; TV is getting way too personal for me, I guess.&nbsp; But that's another rant.   &nbsp;

      Excellent news today, folks.&nbsp;  urlLink America's Team , well on its way to restoring the most spectacular dynasty in all of sports, signed four-time Pro Bowler and Heisman Trophy winner Eddie George to fill their gaping maw at running back.&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't bore you with the stats, but this is freakin' huge.&nbsp; And it will suffice to make me happy for at least a week.&nbsp; Also, training camp begins next Friday, which means the pre-season kickoff game between the 'Boys and the (hiss) Houston Texans is a mere three weeks from tomorrow.&nbsp; Life is good.  As a very significant PS, big thanks to the guys at  urlLink Scrutiny Hooligans  for the link--if you aren't already checking their site daily, you should be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure and watch  urlLink this clip , which they posted&nbsp;earlier today.&nbsp; I think even&nbsp;you radical conservatives (you know who you are) will enjoy it.&nbsp; This also might inspire me to write more intelligent posts about current events, as opposed to stories about kegs.&nbsp; We'll see...  &nbsp;

      1.&nbsp; College graduates are really too old to attempt keg-stands. &nbsp;  2.&nbsp; The devil’s jizz is not, as Alexis has asserted, George Dickel whiskey.&nbsp; It is Bacardi 151, which comes with its own flame-retardant cap.  &nbsp;  3.&nbsp; The recipe used for Windex shots last night severely altered the ratios used by the bartenders at Scruffy’s.&nbsp; I know this because this morning there is much more Blue Curacao left than 151.  &nbsp;  4.&nbsp; The correct recipe for mixing a Windex shot is, according to Cameron and Shawn:&nbsp; “Does it look like Windex?&nbsp; Does it smell like Windex?&nbsp; Does it taste like Windex?&nbsp; Then it’s a Windex shot!” &nbsp;So by that definition, the recipe was okay.  &nbsp;  5.&nbsp; People who say, “No, you’ll like this tequila shot; this tequila is really smooth!” are usually lying.&nbsp; Last night was no exception.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  6.&nbsp; Michele has no qualms about lying in my bathroom floor for several hours of the party, then calling me a “wuss” multiple times because I went to bed before she went home.  &nbsp;  7.&nbsp; If you play pool with someone, you are obligated to sleep with them.&nbsp; Or so some patrons believed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  8.&nbsp; No matter how festive a party might be, if there are at least two church-staters present, a vehement argument regarding the Establishment Clause will occur.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  9.&nbsp; A broken Craftmatic bed is possibly the worst place to pass out, especially if your back was already a little sore from keg-wrestling.&nbsp; I woke up in a position most commonly associated with giving birth.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  10.&nbsp; I’m going to miss Sabrina very, very much.&nbsp;

      Most of you are aware by now that tonight is the culmination of a week of drunken hijinks in honor of Sabrina's pending relocation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Popular opinion decided that we should invest in a keg of south Texas goodness, from the little brewery in Shiner.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The problems with this plan began on Tuesday, when I stopped by Dicorte's to get an idea of how much this would cost.&nbsp; At this point, I was planning on borrowing a shell from someone and simply getting it filled.&nbsp; The clerk at Dicorte's informed me that they didn't fill kegs, and I would have to, "like, go to a brewery or something."&nbsp; I tried to ignore the fact that several people I know had, in fact, had kegs filled up at non-brewery establishments, and I gave him another chance, asking if, maybe, H-E-B would do it?&nbsp; "No, dude, you'd have to, like, go to a brewery."&nbsp;  &nbsp; In the spirit of being nice, I thanked him for his help and left.&nbsp; Luckily I did not believe him, and today, at another Dicorte's, I had the pleasure of obtaining a keg full of Shiner without making the day-long road trip to Shiner, Texas.&nbsp; Even though I had to help a small boy from the stockroom get the keg into my pickup, I was quite the happy camper.  &nbsp; Then I got home, and realized that there is a reason men always go to pick up kegs in groups.&nbsp; I had always thought it was some weird male-bonding ritual, like women going to the restroom together, but today I discovered the real explanation.&nbsp; Kegs are freaking heavy. &nbsp; No one was home when I got here, and I was very paranoid about the beer getting hot.&nbsp; I thought to myself,&nbsp; I'm self-sufficient.&nbsp; I can handle this task.&nbsp; I wanted to somehow maneuver the keg into the shaded backyard, put it in a trash can, and fill the trash can with ice.&nbsp; It all seemed so simple.&nbsp; After wrestling with the keg to get it out of the pickup, smashing no less than two toes, and saying several nasty words in front of the neighbors' children, I resorted to rolling it across the yard very slowly, hoping no one was watching.&nbsp; Did I mention that I still had on heels and a skirt?&nbsp; It was quite graceful. &nbsp; Using a combination of "scoot and wiggle" I managed to get the keg into the trashcan and stand it upright before collapsing into a sweaty, bruised heap on the couch.&nbsp; But I'll be fine, especially after I find someone who knows how to put the tap on; I imagine there will be no shortage of such individuals here in a few hours.&nbsp; All is well with the world.&nbsp;

      After a record-breaking three nights in which I have not gone to bed before 11, I overslept this morning.  I also realized that I am a workaholic, since I considered “oversleeping” to be getting up at 6:15 and getting to the office after 7.  Very bad.  Apparently, my alarm sounded at 5, as planned, but I turned it off instead of waking up.  At 6, I rolled over and looked out the window to notice that it was light outside.  This meant one of two things:  North Korea had figured out how to activate its uranium rods and had blown up Crawford, or that I had slept past dawn, which would make me late.  It was the second option, so I rushed around without time to remove the “water-based” paint that Sabrina swore would wash out of my hair easily.  It has not washed out, but it has worn off to the point that instead of paint, it just looks like head lice.    Rico, as a punishment to his owners for not being home 24 hours a day to accommodate his manic/depressive whims, had scattered everything on the “keys and bills” shelf across the living room.  My glasses also live on this shelf, so after I felt around on the floor long enough to find them, I gave Rico a loving goodbye punt on my way out the door.    As I walked to the driveway, I felt something cold and slimy running down my arm.  Paco’s tacos, which Sabrina left in my refrigerator (two-day rule; I ate them for lunch), were leaking grease on my blouse.  As if those damn quesadillas hadn’t taken up enough of my life while we were waiting 1.5 hours for them at George’s, now they were making me even later than I already was.  I finally made it here, before 8 but in my mind very late.  Luckily, I’ve been fairly busy all day, which will hopefully take my mind off of the fact that I’ll be here until 6.   Informal poll:  how many of you knew what a fluff girl was when you were 19?

      Can I just say that there is, in my very office, a technological marvel that rivals the most advanced of scientific wonders?  It’s the paper shredder.  This thing can shred 20+ pages in one pull and is capable of shredding staples.  You read that correctly, it shreds metal!  I think that Metal Shredders would be a great name for a band, by the way.    I’m not sure why I’m so fascinated by the brawn of the PowerShred 220, but I just keep looking for things to destroy.  At first, I thought that the 220 meant horsepower, but after remembering what the horsepower on an average four-cylinder car is, I decided that the shredder isn’t quite that powerful.  It’s probably volts.  But still, so impressive!  I accidentally dropped a paper clip in it earlier, and I was sure that the fun was over, that it would self-destruct before my eyes, but it actually seemed to enjoy the challenge.   I stopped short of “accidentally” dropping anything larger in, out of fear that I would anger the beast, or my boss.  Note to any co-workers who read this:  I’m really not dropping random things in the paper shredder.    I think if in 1985 the Russians had possessed the paper shredding technology that the U.S.D.A. has now, we would all be in line for day-old bread in front of a giant statue of Joseph Stalin.

      I hate fucking Wal-Mart.  I think they represent everything that is wrong with America, but that’s another rant.  I avoid them like the plague, but today, an unusual confluence of circumstances forced me to patronize one.  Circumstances being that I was really, really in the mood for some new rock and roll, combined with the fact that I don’t know my way around Cleburne that well, and Wal-Mart was the only place I could get to that sold CDs.     So I bobbed and weaved through racks of Dale Earnhardt, Jr., paraphernalia and made it to the media section, where I searched for something to fit my mood.  Due to the sudden blog popularity of the Beastie Boys, I picked up their newest.  I made my way to the front of the store, where I waited in the express lane line near a display of aluminum implements that help you insert a can of beer up a chicken’s ass.  They should really test the manual dexterity of cashiers before assigning them to a high-pressure position like “Express Lane.”  After taking 15 minutes to check out 3 people who each had an average of 2 items, the girl sort of apologized to #1 Tony Stewart fan, who was in front of me, by saying, “I never work in this part.”  No shit?  She then spent another 3 minutes searching for a carton of the special kind of Marlboros that Tony’s biggest supporter wanted, while the woman said repeatedly, “They’re right there.  No, there.  Over here.”   I wanted to yell, “Next to the Reds, dumbass!” but I’m trying to be nice to service industry employees in order to lessen my karmic debt from the Taco Bell thing.  On my way out of the store, a red-headed kid who weighed at least 150 lbs. stepped on my foot.  His mother immediately began beating him, which made me laugh out loud.  Not because I’m a child abuser, but because it reminded me of the story Sabrina was telling me last night.  I didn’t take the time to explain this to the lady, who gave me a dirty look even while she was smacking her 8-year-old.    I get in my pickup, only mildly frustrated, and pop in the CD.  Guess what?  It’s the fucking edited version.  I know, I should have checked first, and what was I thinking, buying a CD that didn’t have the “Explicit Lyrics” label on it, but damn, I was pissed.   Music just isn’t the same if you can’t hear all of the obscenities.  So I’ve vowed to not set foot into a Wal-Mart for as long as I possibly can.  Everything I could possibly need from that hellhole can be obtained at Target, HEB, and Dicorte’s.   Except maybe the chicken sodomizer.  All of this frustration could be indicative of a larger problem.  I have begun to reconsider Sabrina’s “now that you’re single, you need to get back on the horse as quickly as possible” advice (or some animal metaphor).  Wait, hers has something to do with a racetrack.  Anyway, I’m considering it not because I think that it’s particularly good advice, but instead because I think my lack of a horse is beginning to manifest itself in my moods.  Two good friends have suggested that I’m a little testier than normal, also supported by the above events; they passed along ways to remedy this grouchiness that I won’t repeat here because this is a family blog.  The kicker is that my own mother, to whom I repeated Sabrina’s suggestion so that she could reassure me it was not a wise choice, said, “Well, that’s not a bad idea.”  Me:  “Mom, you’re not supposed to say that.”  Mom:  “It might help.”    If your own mother thinks you’re so irritable that she condones out-of-wedlock relations, I can only imagine how pissy I must seem to friends who are not bound by blood to put up with me.

      You think this story's over but it's ready to begin...Paul Revere, by the Beastie Boys, in honor of Brina.  Yes, an era of our lives is closing.  Sabrina is really leaving Waco, final as of this Sunday.  I won't wax philosophic about the beginning/ending tensions of different parts of growing up, or losing a friend to geography, or any of that.  I would like to tell a story about what true friends do:  they convince other friends not to waste an evening at George's, which one of us wanted to do, and instead paint a bathroom so as to recapture one's deposit, which is what we actually did.     When Jaimee and I moved into our current digs, there was some pretty hideous wallpaper in the kitchen and both bathrooms.  Jaimee, in all of her artistic talent, not only re-plastered the kitchen, painted it, and added a border, but also repainted her bathroom and made cute designs on the wall with a sponge, something I didn't even know was possible.  One night, after some mild drinking, I decided that I, too, would redecorate my bathroom.  I pulled the wallpaper off, which everyone knows is the fun part, and then decided that I'd rather go to bed.  For the last 12 months I've lived with a trendy, wallpaper-glue look in my bathroom.  Not that it really bothered me.    But Sabrina, a true friend, insisted on fixing the bathroom.  I never knew getting wallpaper glue off could be such a horrid ordeal, but we tried valiantly for a couple of hours last night before going with my original idea--just plaster over it.  Which is now about 25% finished and working pretty well.  I also learned how to put paint on a roller, and about the nuances of rolling paint onto a wall, a skill I will hopefully never put to use again.  Except for tonight, when we finish.   The moral of the story is this:  true friends take an evening and a half out of their final week in Waco to repair what their undecorative friends have done to their bathrooms.  And at the end of the evening (we ran out of paint), I also got my wish:  a cold Shiner at Scruff's, in celebration of Henry David Thoreau's birthday (we were grasping).

      I have come to the conclusion that my importance to the Rural Development office is not, as I originally believed, that I am capable of doing things that no one else is, but instead, that I am willing to do things that no one else will.  I spent the hour between 7 and 8 this morning hauling garbage cans of outdated files to the dumpster that is 30 yards from the back door of our office.  Said dumpster has not been emptied in at least a week, and the weather here has been alternately wet and extremely hot, conditions that are sufficient to bring things in the dumpster to frankenstein-like life.    Needless to say, even at 7am, I sweated enough to render my makeup useless, and to add insult to injury, my valiant efforts to organize the files here gave me a blister on my soft little hand.  And somehow, I've noticed a pattern as to the height of my heels in relation to the amount of manual labor I do that day.  The taller my heels, the more crap I have to move around.  At one point, I moved about 2000 lbs. of documents from one room to another while wearing 3" heels.  I looked very fashionable, but my back was killing me.  Today, I'm down to about a little over a 2" heel, and I'm estimating that I trucked 300 lbs. about 100 feet.    All of this to say, "cushy" office jobs, as it has been implied on  urlLink others' blogs , are not as cushy as they seem.

      So there I was, sitting on a beanbag chair, naked, eating Cheetos.  And watching Ron White.  Okay, so I was really wearing a robe, sitting on the faux leather loveseat, eating Kraft Cheese and Macaroni.  But the concept is the same.  Something about my recent slackerness finally overstepped its bounds, and in the past few hours I have washed and detailed the pickup, started on the months' worth of laundry that has been stashed in my closet (I tend to buy new clothes when everything I own is dirty), and scoured my bathroom, as best I know how.  Domestic duties are not my strong suit, as evidenced by this exchange between Darby and myself:  Darby:  So I was cleaning the baseboards, and he says....  Me:  What's a baseboard?  I think that's what they're called.  Anyway, as a reward to myself for being productive, I got my nails done (I actually did this yesterday, as a kind of pre-reward, but that's not important).  While I was at the nail place, my suspicions that Southeastern Asians are going to make all of us lazy Americans their slaves were reaffirmed, as well as several random conspiracy theories I've been harboring.  First, it goes without saying that the people who do my nails constantly mock their customers without our knowledge.  Despite speaking conversational English, they insist on making comments in their native language and then laughing, while I sit there and smile, hoping they will not grind my finger completely off.  This reminds me of the linguistic empathy that Mom suddenly learned when I took her to Mexico for the first time.  "Now I know why all the hired help just smiles and nods when you tell them to do something."  This was just after the conductor on the train asked her where we were staying, and she smiled and nodded yes.  Also, I think the nail techs are making me their drug mule by mixing illegal substances into my manicure, then removing them when I return.  I'm not sure what purpose this serves, except to force me into possessing illegal drugs and maybe keep all of their operational materials away from their "salon" front, in case of a raid.  I say this because the smell of the stuff they put on my nails is exactly like the smell from when a meth lab caught on fire in Laguna Park and stunk up Lake Whitney for three days.     Finally, as I sat there and watched the news, a story came on about the  urlLink spontaneous combustion of Hondas , which I can only attribute to the plot to take over the U.S.  They have tried to blame it on the mechanics, but I have my doubts.  Thank God I don't have a foreign vehicle, and if I did, I think I would go with a German one.  They've already had their shot at world dominance.

      A couple of folks have inquired about what, exactly, went on at Taco Bell Tuesday night.  In the interests of shaming myself into behaving more appropriately,  urlLink here is the link to Sabrina's entry  about exactly what happened.  Keep in mind that if I'm ever under oath, I will deny these events like nobody's business.    I am thinking about sending flowers to the night shift at Taco Bell.

      Since I am office-sitting in Groesbeck today, my list of tasks to complete is woefully small.  To pass the time alone in an office in which I don’t normally work, I have been googling variations of my name.  I am not nearly as pervasive of a presence on the internet as I would like to be.  In fact, one of the top responses for my name is actually one of those “meet the Raiders” pages from when my stepbrother played football at Tech, and I’m listed as “sister of the lineman”.  Which is pretty cool, but not as cool as actually having your own listing.  The ubiquitous Joe Randa, 3rd baseman for the Kansas City Royals, was prevalent in my searches, as always.  I’ve been a follower of his since high school, when I spotted his surname during a KC-Rangers matchup.  He’s a better-than-average player, not exactly Ken Griffey, Jr., but has a decent bat, solid fielding.  So I enjoy sharing a name with him.    I also discovered  urlLink Randa Corp.,  the world’s leader in men’s accessories.  Randa's many innovations and technological developments as a neckwear company include being the first American company to open offshore manufacturing, in Puerto Rico, 1964 as well as being the first American company to open a manufacturing facility in Europe, Gino Pompeii, 1969.  Apparently, Randa Corp. is also an expert in merging with companies that have nothing to do with men’s accessories, as evidenced by their “other products” listings: “Our brand portfolio includes such names as Dockers, Geoffrey Beene, Slates and Van Heusen.  We also exclusively market a vast variety of novelty brands such as American Greetings, The Beatles, Endangered Species, Tabasco and Save the Children.”  What the Beatles have in common with Tabasco Sauce and Dockers is beyond me, other than profits.  That’s why I’m not in the business school.    I also found a new baseball player with whom I share a name, not as accomplished as Joe Randa but also pretty young, named Justin Randa.  He plays at—you guessed it—Barton County Community College in Kansas.  He’s a lefty with a 2-3 record, ERA kind of stinks but not a bad batting average, .283.  I wonder if he’s related to Joe.    So, I really need something to do today.  I’ve even stooped so low as to read Ann Coulter’s  urlLink latest pile of op/ed crap , in which she compares trial lawyers to strippers and insinuates that John Edwards likes to kill unborn children for entertainment, with the help of their “liberal mothers.”  Christ.

      This post exists for no other reason than to put something halfway intelligent-sounding on the blog.  Although my self-analysis is not nearly in the same class as Michele’s, I am going to attempt to deconstruct why I insist on having too many drinks on weeknights, resulting in my making an ass of myself at the Taco Bell drive-through (although I did get our order correctly completed).    1.	 Addictive personality.   I am aware of my own self-control shortcomings, meaning that when I am confronted with a vice, it is highly likely I will take full advantage of the chance to participate in said vice.  I like eating, drinking, gambling, and spending money, none of which I am very capable of doing in moderation.    2.	 Alpha male shifting.   Normally, Sabrina is the alpha male of our circle of friends, which is fine with me.  I don’t like making decisions for other people, and I’m usually okay with whatever form of entertainment everyone else chooses, so I don’t make a good leader for group activities.  However, an interesting phenomenon that should be studied in more detail occurs whenever Sabrina and I drink:  she becomes less dominant, and my alpha alter ego takes charge.  This, combined with #1, means rounds of shots for everyone, even if they don’t want to take them.  This personality shift comes complete with a full range of synonyms for calling someone a pussy if they don’t drink as much as I think they should, and sneaky methods of getting people to take shots they don’t want to (Blue Hawaiian, anyone?).    3.	 Competitiveness.   Having grown up as somewhat of a tomboy and feeling compelled to do everything as well as or better than the boys, I cannot do anything without making it into a contest.  When I was younger, this meant proving that I could run as fast, work as hard, drink as much, and tee off from the men’s box.  Today, I time myself on things like blow-drying my hair to see if I can set a personal record, and I’m constantly trying to shave a few minutes off of my commute to work.  This competitiveness (obsessiveness?) carries over into my extracurricular activities with authority, making me take three shots when one Windex would have been plenty to ensure that I talked too much and about inappropriate topics.    4.	 Environmental factors.   These include my impending sense of losing friends (physically, at least) to jobs, schools, and husbands.  In a few short weeks, I will be 800 miles away from everything that is familiar, and I feel compelled to squeeze in as much fun and games as are possible before that era of my life begins.  I’ve lived in Waco for five full years now, and my initial distaste (hate) for it has gradually evolved to the point that I now consider it home.   Waco, I barely knew ye.  5.	 Dietary restrictions.   Beer has been and always will be my beverage of choice.  Unfortunately, I actually like the taste of beer, which precludes me from drinking any of the “low calorie” versions, which all taste like club soda.  I like real beer, with real calories, and since I have sworn to myself that I’m going to lose a couple of pounds someday, I have altered my drink of choice to include diet soda.  I’ve always been a big fan of the Jack Daniels, and so I reason with myself that having a few Jack and diet Cokes is much healthier than having a six-pack of Budweiser.  I have noticed a marked difference in my ability to filter the things that come out of my mouth when I drink whiskey, however, as well as an increased likelihood of a debilitating hangover.  I’m still debating on which I’d rather be:  thin and obnoxious, or not-as-thin and pleasant.  As you can see, I’ve put a lot of thought into this.   Comments or suggestions are welcome below.

      Just for the record, I'm going to get the story of tonight out before other, more biased stories can make their rounds.    1.  Michele, I'm horribly sorry for the mispell.  After everything I've gone through to not be "Ronda," "Randi," and various names beginning with "B", I understand more than most what it's like to have an irregular name.  2.  Sabrina, you did not drink nearly enough to justify being a Master of the Arts, but congratulations anyway because you are now officially more educated than I am.  3.  The fuckers at Taco Bell can kiss my ass, regardless of what drunken Sabrina and Michele say.  They are incompentent bastards who need to be reminded not to ejaculate in customers' orders.    4.  I beat everyone to the punch on this post, meaning that my version of events is the one that goes for this evening.  If anyone would like to question what happened tonight, I suggest that they stay up late enough and have enough manual dexterity to blog at 2:33am.  Otherwise, my story is the inerrant, capital T truth.  I win.

      For the past few years, I have been accused of being an old woman.  I watch the ten o'clock news, if I'm up that late.  I have almost completely (with the exception of Wine-Tasting Whichever Day We Pick That Week) stopped drinking on weekdays.  I catch myself checking the fiber content of breakfast cereals.  I curse the neighbors’ high schoolers who rev their engines after 9PM and play their rap “music” too loudly.  I gloriously and authoritatively put these rumors to rest this weekend, with two full days of patriotic debauchery.  Granted, it will take me another two full days to recover, but that’s a small price to pay to remind everyone—including myself—that I’m still a mere 23 years old.        The fun started Saturday afternoon, when I met up with Jaimee, Coby and Adrian at the Steakhouse for some wine tasting.  Michele joined us after her duties at Starbuck’s were finished, and I think the three of us managed to go through three bottles of wine before finally having to leave (two hours after the Steakhouse officially closed).  In our infinite wisdom, Michele and I decided that a few drinks at Scruffy’s were in order, and we proceeded farther and farther away from my house.  As always, good company was to be found at Scruff’s, and I’m pretty sure we closed it down (although we were not, fortunately, allowed to loiter for two hours post-closing).  Michele made the mistake of telling me she had never seen Tombstone, the greatest movie ever made, and so we spent the hours between 2:30-ish and 4 with Tombstone playing.  Finding ourselves to be the only people awake, we decided to retreat to my room for a few hours of sleep, only to find that Coby had already commandeered a spot on the floor.  This is odd, because he has his own room in our house.  But it worked out well, because Michele and I simply took over Coby’s bed, which is bigger than mine anyway.  After discussing the intricacies of various types of relationships, examining several mental/behavioral disorders, and realizing that the sun had risen quite a bit above the horizon, we fell asleep somewhere around 7.  At about 11, I took Michele to her car at the Steakhouse (where we happily noted that she was not the only person to have abandoned ship the night before!) and I returned to the house with high hopes of sleeping for much of the afternoon.  My more culinary friends dashed those hopes by appearing at our door around noon with several pounds of ribs, a watermelon that had been soaked in various types of liquor, and a keg.    I gave up on sleeping and embraced the fourth of July for what it is:  an excuse to drink excessively and set things on fire.  Oh, and to get too much sun, which is what we did.  About halfway through the evening, I absolutely had to take a nap, so I snuck into Jaimee’s room and crashed for a few hours.  I woke up just long enough to watch the Waco fireworks show (fireworks are my favorite part of the year) before going back to sleep, this time in my own room.  That’s right, I completed the trifecta, sleeping in each and every bed in my house within 24 hours.  So it’s not exactly the same as winning the Preakness, Belmont, and Kentucky Derby, but I was still pretty impressed with myself.   Today, Sabrina defends her thesis.  If it's possible to beat some of the times that we've had in the past for various celebrations (birthdays, seminar paper defenses, because it's Tuesday, etc.) tonight will be the time to do just that.  I've been torn between partying like it's 1776 and partying like Kennedys, so I've decided that tonight we're going to party like Kennedys in 1776.  Viva la Revolucion, and Teddy!

      Remember the Alanis Morissette song “Isn’t It Ironic?”  What always bugged me about the song was its list of things that were allegedly ironic:  rain on your wedding day, good advice you didn’t take, meeting the man of your dreams and finding out that he’s married, etc.  These aren’t ironies, they just suck.  I understand that the song wouldn’t have been as big of a hit if it had been titled “Doesn’t It Suck?” and the rhyme scheme would have to be altered, but at least it wouldn’t be misinforming millions of young people about the definition of irony.  Now  urlLink this  is real irony:  Dallas City Councilwoman Elba Garcia was one of several council members to vocally support switching many of the police and fire departments' vehicles to electric/gas hybrids.  Ideally, this switch would save the city hundreds of thousands of dollars in gasoline costs as well as reduce emissions from the older vehicles.  The city was quite eager to integrate the hybrids into the departments' fleets, and did so despite some valid concerns about the performance of the new vehicles.  Many police officers voiced complaints about the acceleration abilities of the hybrids, as well as a lack of reputable and/or accessible maintenance providers.  The council agreed that these concerns were not more important than saving a few bucks and appearing environmentally friendly, and the DPD and DFD now drive hybrid cars and trucks.  And Elba Garcia, Dallas's environmentally-concerned, fiscally responsible public servant, has a gigantic Humvee parked in her driveway.    That, my friends, doesn't just suck. It is ironic.

       urlLink Some  of my friends will use the below story to illustrate the lack of bias at Fox News, saying that it proves they will report embarrasing stories about Republicans with as much journalistic integrity as they use when bashing Democrats.  urlLink Others  of you will agree with me, that this story simply shows the lengths to which Fox News will go to give free campaign publicity to nutjobs who have watched too much American History X. It also raises even deeper concerns on my part about what goes on in  urlLink Tennessee . Full text to follow, from the one and only  urlLink FoxNews.com .   NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Republican congressional candidate James L. Hart acknowledges that he is an "intellectual outlaw." He is an unapologetic supporter of eugenics, the phony science that resulted in thousands of sterilizations in an attempt to purify the white race.  He believes the country will look "like one big Detroit" if it doesn't eliminate welfare and immigration.  He believes that if blacks were integrated centuries ago, the automobile never would have been invented.    Despite his radical views, Hart may end up winning the Republican nomination because he is the only GOP candidate on the ballot in Thursday's primary. His presence in the campaign has embarrassed Republican leaders, who were blind-sided by Hart after they didn't bother fielding a candidate. Democratic Rep. John Tanner has held the seat for 15 years and is considered safe in November. Republicans now desperately hope that a write-in candidate will stop Hart. "I would characterize him as a racist, an elitist," said write-in candidate Dennis Bertrand, a financial analyst and former military officer. "His idea of ... genetically altering the human race in order to build a super race with super intelligence is appalling."    Much of Hart's platform revolves around eugenics, which arose in the early 20th century as a pseudoscientific movement to solve social problems by preventing the "unfit" from having children. It inspired 33 states to pass laws that allowed the sterilization of some 65,000 people, and Nazi Germany used the U.S. examples to justify programs that sterilized and killed millions.    Hart, a 60-year-old real estate agent, knows his views on eugenics are far from the mainstream and viewed as racist by most people. He insists his beliefs have  nothing to do with racism and everything to do with "favored races" from Europe and Asia and "less-favored races" from Africa.  To achieve his goal of a country populated by "favored races," Hart proposes eliminating both welfare and immigration. "If an individual demonstrates the ability to produce and contribute to society, he or she would be encouraged to have more children. People on welfare would not," Hart said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.    Bertrand says he found out about Hart's views after returning from active duty with the National Guard and going on the Internet to learn more about the race in Tennessee's 8th District. He says he is running to make sure Hart does not win the Republican Party's endorsement. "I was just appalled by what I'd seen there," said Bertrand, who has been active in local politics for years. "It had nothing to do with the beliefs I have, or of any Republican I know -- or any Democrat or independent for that matter." Bertrand immediately was endorsed by the statewide grass-roots group TeamGOP, which called for Republicans to "unite against the politics of hate."    The 8th District covers the mostly rural counties of northwest Tennessee, stretching from north Memphis to Clarksville. Many of the counties have large black populations. The two candidates continue to actively campaign for the nomination -- Bertrand visiting local GOP gatherings and Hart going door-to-door with his unorthodox, gun-toting approach. " Every person who opens the door -- as long as they're white -- I'll say, 'I'm James Hart. I'm running for Congress.  My name will be on the ballot in the Aug. 5 Republican primary. I think white children deserve the same rights as everyone else."'     What do you bet this guy doesn't get the keynote speech at the Republican Convention?

      Ninja points to anyone who gets the title.  Several important news items today, all of which deserve equal attention, therefore, for the business school student in all of us, a bulleted list:    Blogging has been hard to come by lately, due to a bizarre computer dysfunction that has rendered my z, x, c, b, n, and m keys useless. I'm not sure why the v was spared. I would think that if you had to give up a row of keys, it would be the bottom one, but there are very few coherent sentences that don't contain at least one of those letters. So home computer usage is a no-go for now, and work has been very crazy, to say the least.       Moving is one of the few things I'm not very good at. This problem is compounded by the fact that when I'm not good at something, I tend to just not do it at all (see: Playstation 2 games, volleyball). Some of these activities, however, are required (e.g., parking) and moving falls into that category. I have now put off packing until I have exactly 3 evenings left before the big U-Haul arrives. I really don't feel like packing tonight, either, but my mom keeps calling and reminding me of the time she showed up on moving day and I hadn't packed a thing. She was livid. I was also asleep on the couch with a NASCAR race on when she arrived, so that kind of made it worse. She's threatening bodily harm if everything isn't neatly boxed up by Friday morning.       The South Texas Bachelorette Weekend of Fun. This was one of the highlights of my summer. It consisted of my best friend, who's getting married at Thanksgiving, her sister and yours truly hanging out in various parts of south Texas all weekend and drinking lots of beer. We floated the Comal river, with some parts being less "float" and more "hold on for dear life." Luckily, going somewhere with Darby is like having your own personal Eagle Scout; not only had she packed the basics, like a cooler o' cans, some munchies, sunscreen, etc., but she also vacuum sealed towels and dry clothes for after the ride. Unfortunately, they all flew out when we hit our first big set of rapids. Also at this juncture, while Darby worked on cutting her tube away from the trees she hit, some preadolescent delinquents stole all of the cash out of our cooler. The little punks weren't even old enough to go for the beer and cigarettes. Bastards. They then had the nerve to tell Darby that "If there was any money in there, it must have floated away." If I hadn't been chasing my flip-flops through rushing water, I would have beaten their river rat asses. The river police, of course, were busy writing tickets for people who had styrofoam coolers instead of investigating robberies, so we gave up and continued to float. It was a great time, though, and I managed to get some good sun. I've been spending most of my time indoors and I was beginning to get a little pasty.        The South Texas Bachelorette Weekend of Fun, part II: After having dinner at the Gristmill in Gruene (excellent, especially when all you've had all day is beer and sun) with some lovely companions from St. Mary's that we lured to dinner with us, we crashed a bachelor party at Tavern on the Gruene, down the road. Actually, we were minding our own drunken business and our table was crashed by the bachelors (most of whom were married). But it was all in good fun. We finally drug Darby back to the hotel, where we nursed sunburns and hangovers most of the morning.       The South Texas Bachelorette Weekend of Fun, the finale: Met up with Mom in Luckenbach to hear some good tunes and relax for one more day. Was pleasantly surprised to see several of my favorites were playing, and even more pleasantly surprised to run into some friends from back home. A fitting conclusion to a great "last hurrah" of a weekend.       Finally, yesterday evening I made my way back to Fort Worth to get one last Pappadeaux's fix before heading to the land with no saltwater nearby. The ladies from Hillsboro introduced me to Gator Water, which is (from what I can tell) a Hurricane topped with a margarita topped with a shot of something green. They were delicious. Several of them, each better than the last. After some racy stories and more than one wobbly trip to the restroom, we ventured back towards Waco. Previous plans were to have a semi-slumber party at Cyndi's house, which is much closer to the office than my house. I wondered, en route, if we should stop and get some beer, and Cyndi rattled off what was already at the house. It was like the Cricket's draft list; we didn't need a pit stop at all. After some domestics, a few imports, and a couple of Goldschlager shots, it was--of course--time to play dominoes. Somehow I made it until 2, waiting for someone else to say they were tired so I wouldn't be the first one again. I think it was pretty even this time. I successfully navigated Cyndi's house this morning and made it to work on time, comforted by the fact that my coworkers were as miserable as I was all morning. It also helped that I had leftover salmon for lunch.        I'm so bad at bulleted lists. I'm too long-winded for them. But at least I try.   So that's it. These events, among others, are what has kept me from the blessed blog lately. I'll be cutting off the utilities this weekend and heading to Dudley, which is the greatest place on earth, but also does not have broadband internet. So if I can bear the rotary dial-up (I'm not joking, Mom still has a rotary phone and refuses to get touchtone), I'll be in touch next week.   Also, anyone interested in a *free* two-way trip to Kansas can have their dream come true this weekend. That's right, folks, just a little heavy lifting and you'll have the pleasure of riding in a vehicle with me for over 16 hours.
