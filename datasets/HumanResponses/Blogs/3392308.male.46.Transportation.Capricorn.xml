						   Good morning, still waiting in limbo-land job-wise, got an interview in the next couple of days, hoping for the best. My wife's still sick but on the mend , it seems, at least she's back on her feet. I'm hoping she feels better, all the way better, very soon, it just kills me to see her all poopy and dragging, she's so vital most of the time.   Looks like we're going to get some more rain during the next few days as well, like we need THAT! The garden's liking it ok but I want to get our new deck stained so we can cross off one more thing on our eight-page to-do list! LOL  That's all for now.

						   Having great big fun these last few days... I may have lost my job but may also have found a new one. My wife is home sick with allergies, sinusitus and a raging bronchial infection so I'm playing Nurse Nancy as best as I can. Strangely enough I'm very calm and cool through all this, I guess the old saying "when the situation is hopeless there's nothing to worry about" really does apply! Been working in our garden/yard lately as well, putting in a small deck, weeding and planning this year's layout & improvements. By this time next year it should be a cool, calming oasis, a little zen, a little backyard-vegetable-market, a little wild woodland, and all this in a space that is scarcely larger than a postage stamp! LOL Need to get a couple of small but relevant statues, e.g. BVM (Blessed Virgin Mary), Hotei, etc. to complete the ambience... Thanks for reading!  John

						   Water Wishes  Can we ever understand where water wants to go?  We think we know how it goes, maybe even the direction Given gravity or evaporation...  But the wishes of water, here in one form/emptiness for eternity Baffles our already tied tongues And fools look knowingly at each other and wink at our expense.  Water is liquid cats Watching vaporous birds In fog-trees  We are resistance, trying to foil water's designs on us As effective means of transport. Denying wishes we don't even know.  We harness it and it chuckles over water-wheels Laughs through aqueducts Positively guffaws as it whines through dam turbines  Knowing what it knows Going where it goes Wishing what it wishes.

						   Incandescent Sun  Out of the cold sunlight- Incandescent- A room remains, A rock- A place that becomes mantra. The coffee and cigarettes A liturgy so familiar as to become sublime Walls hold spent husks Of convergent paths- Old ways forgotten The debris quietly reclaimed By rough roadside grasses

						   Haiku   Open the door The birds take frantic wing Into the sun   Cold black ice The room warms slowly Bright reggae    Woe to the man Who fulfills a prophecy Made by his own hands!    Sun setting in clouds The hills rise suddenly dark The last blackbird note   At dawn bird calls Dogwood and magnolia Bloom all at once!   Woman, you waken The long dance of moon and tides When you touch my arm   A long dance begins Woman when you touch my arm The tide comes, glowing.

						                        French Fries  The uneaten French fries on the table  Acquire the stiffness Of winter Euonymous  A cup of  Half-burnt coffee  Thickens. Love has turned slowly  Under iced eaves  The roof holds New Year's resolve  Falls in a far wood No news today.  The football game Rests lightly On sleepy eyes.

						   	"Finding"    This blackest of days Rolled on forever; All my tomorrows will be worse Until this thing you have made Is resolved or banished.  A disturbing recurrence  Of reaching desperately, The need perhaps too long neglected but in fairness never expressed, The need, then, For this new shiny bauble, This new treasure of yours  Forbidden, fenced, mercurial on the Oh-so-greener other side.  Mercury, fleet and sleek, good for gauging heat But when ingested, poison.  Oh this thing will burn hotly to be sure, In flames of novel bright colors But it will give no lasting warmth And like poor pine, over-dried Will be consumed in an instant While destroying the house with its careless blaze And all who dwell in it.  Remember ashes and tears give no luster.  So take care what you grab My dearest love, For in foolishly finding the wrong thing All your truest treasure may be lost.   (Aug., 2003)

						   EVERYBODY ELSE GETS KENSHO FIRST  What is it with this?  Why do even the birds sitting in the cedars smile and breathe at me? Miserable little waxwings chirping smugly about some dog belonging to  some cat named Joshu! No rhythms left, my heartbeats have become erratic like birdflight in the wind rising like clouds of vegetables spilling from the tipped bin of a vendor named Luigi.  We cant and roll towards each other then away Whistling in different and ever-changing keys No one calls a tune we know so we improvise badly And wonder why it sounds like shit!  Can I stop dancing down the alley long enough to look back up at the sky? To even notice the ubiquitous pigeons that are forever threatening to crap on my head?

						   				Beast  Not to deny  But embrace- The quaking beast within us This is true mastery. To grapple with those paws Smell that funky breath And plumb the fiery yellow eyes This will yield up a strange peace Much greater than the wounds. Yet who, hearing the quartering in the bracken,  The sheathed rumble in the hungry throat. Wouldn't hasten their steps Towards the vapid yet now precious Comfort of home?  To face this You must follow the solitary track Up the hill Into the dark, my dear...

						                                          Random Thoughts: 				           Love     It is not just picking the right one but perhaps more so being the right one that will ensure happiness in a relationship.   Love is a creative endeavor, and, like most other creative arts, it is 10% Inspiration, 90% perspiration. Anyone can "strike gold" in the inspiration arena once or twice, but like so many "one hit wonders" in the music field, the results pale and fade away quickly. It is truly the self-absorbed and lazy lover who relies solely on the bright flash of infatuation for satisfaction while ignoring the true "work" of building and nurturing a love that will last for the ages.   Love is an action, not merely a "feeling." It inspires and broadens the person who loves, instead of narrowing and crushing the will, the moral fiber and reducing the most sublime of all emotions to a tawdry game of chasing after the next thrill. To love is to put the self and the ego aside often in favor of partnering with the soul, body and being of the loved, of dreaming together, nurturing the separate dreams of each and striving to walk at peace with one's beloved.   By "peace" I mean harmony, even in the midst of disagreement, perhaps mostly in times of disagreement. For in disagreement there need not be enmity or anger, certainly not hate! To respect the other as an individual of great worth, despite his or her foibles, quirks and outright defects is to honor the commitment two have made for each other. To realize that the other has as much a right to have feelings, opinions, plans, dreams and the right to be wrong occasionally is paramount. We cannot expect to be loved and respected when we trample the emotions, desires and feelings of the other. Greed has no place in a loving relationship!   To keep oneself locked away from the good will and good wishes of  the other is the most intolerable of cruelties. To shut out even the possibility of growth and support only demeans the other and destroys any hope of trust and true partnership. To "go it alone" in all things, (unless the partner has proven themselves to be absolutely untrustworthy),  serves only to foster resentment, accrue ill will and lead to disastrous and horribly misguided judgement on the part of the closed-off one. For when one lives in complete emotional isolation, things only fester, distort and die off from lack of "mental/emotional fresh air" and any sense of perspective. Self-will run riot will cause only pain and bitterness in both parties. Better to be hated than to be ignored.  All-in-all, the unrestrained ego, the self run rampant, (despite perhaps some overwhelming "baggage" and traumatic issues), has no place in a loving relationship, at least if these aspects of personality are hidden beneath a thick fog of denial, rationalization and self-pity. To attempt to go forward alone, without help and support is sadly doomed from the start. Fear must be placed aside, complacency must not enter the picture and thoughts of personal gain of any sort must be banished in order for progress to be made. We all have needs, we all have desires and goals but to be loved and to love in return in the complete sense, which is what we all want is to be willing at least to temper these desires, channel them into something that can at least be appreciated by the other if not actually shared, (though by expressing them one often finds a new and eager ally in the attainment of them, though this is of course impossible if they are never expressed!), and work to help each other grow and develop into the best person they can be. This is not a stupid platitude but the very heart of the true work of real love.  To avoid, evade or run away from this work and these challenges is to deny love itself and to close off any possibility of attaining the true love with the "soul mate" we all so desire.   True, giving space and "breathing room" to one's love is absolutely essential as well. To smother one's partner, to shut them out of the possibilities of growth is equally bad for the relationship. One cannot grow without fresh air and sunshine. But this growth must happen within the boundaries of the love each feels, or used to feel, given the moment, for the other. Neither party can grow in love if they feel either stunted or shut out. This balance can be very tricky if there are difficulties either with the couple or with either individual. If the couple has problems, they can be magnified by resentment to a point where they become overwhelming, way out of proportion with the actual reality of the situation.  Likewise, if one of the parties is struggling with personal issues, either current or as the result of the past, especially when this struggle is done in isolation, either out of denial, fear or embarrassment, the problems can be all-consuming, destroying any sense of perspective, of what is right, even the feelings the person has for their partner! The problems become monsters of unimaginable ferocity, gnawing away at a person's soul until all possibility of extending one's self becomes seemingly impossible, until judgement lapses completely and selfishness rules every aspect of the person's life. This is horribly tragic in that help and support are usually right at this unfortunate's fingertips but they seem unable (actually probably unwilling) to just reach out and accept the loving help and support that are there for them, at least if their partner really loves them. To do this would bring about the true flowering of what love is; the unconditional acknowledgment of the person's worth, of their place in the other's heart and life. True, any wrongs need to be addressed and righted, any deceits need to be ended and honesty, complete honesty must rule the day. This may be difficult and painful for both people but it is essential if they want to go on, to realize the happiness they both want, for each other!   This pain, however, will be short-lived and fleeting compared to the joy of building something that is actually worthwhile and lasting, a love that they can look back on and marvel at the difficulties they have overcome and the joys they have experienced. This is far superior to looking back at nothing but a string of failures and regrets!   A love that is true, that can stand up to the storms of life, is the greatest of all treasures. It is something that is built and maintained, not a flimsy feeling that is blown away by the next feeling or emotional blip. It is something that can be looked on humbly, as a thing far greater than either of the people involved, not a "trophy" to be viewed arrogantly, not a false bauble attained by deceit and selfishness, not a pipe dream of adolescent love songs that rarely deal with the true, sometimes mundane, day-to-day workings of a real love. IN short, love is the product of mutual commitment, of working together, even when you don't feel like it, of being open and honest and supportive of each other, of offering the self unconditionally to the other, knowing full well the risks of being vulnerable but being willing to take them because that is the only way we can ever have the love we all want.

						   How does one negotiate the sometimes stormy seas of one's own feelings and emotions? It's undoubtedly difficult to avoid the rocks and rapids of fears and our own "baggage", especially when we don't acknowledge either! Denying a fear or refusing to look deep enough for the causes of our neuroses assure only that we will have them as travelling companions for a very long time! There is no stronger emotion or feeling than a repressed one.   This of course does not mean we need to give in or act upon every whim or impulse that comes along! Only an idiot would follow through on every "nudge" or even "shove" he or she receives courtesy of the sometimes capricious universe! To do that will only amount to bowing to chaos and deepening one's self-absorbtion.  Even those dedicated to "doing the next right thing" encounter difficulties, sometimes profound difficulties, in determining what the proper course of action (or inaction). Here is where having a couple of trusted, (and trustworthy), friends comes into play.   In confiding in someone we trust, we become vulnerable and that can be very frightening but what opening ourselves up actually does is remove our obsessive focus on our own bloated egos being the center of the universe and begins to restore some sense of perspective. We realise that fear is often it's own acronym; False Evidence Appearing Real. We begin to see how our thoughts, feelings, actions and attitudes often serve to further isolate us from the love and companionship we desire and how these same factors damage our relationships with others.   Hopefully we all have at least one person in whom we can truly be ourselves, warts and all, and who will not judge us, who has no "agenda" to further, who will offer loving crticism where it is warranted, (though that critique may indeed be very painful to hear!), and who has the priceless advatage of emotional distance and perspective and can offer support and guidance, even if it's only to offer a shoulder to lean on and a gentle pointing towards the right direction.  In opening ourselves up, in becoming a little more vulnerable by risking our huge paper egos, we offer ourselves to the world, trusting that those who TRULY love us will accept us as "works-in-progress" and eagerly join us in our journey towars becoming better people, for it is only in staying on the "path towards perfection" (which of course we will nevr actually complete in this lifetime) that we truly become able to love and as a consequence to be loved.
