      Well, I would like to say some things before I get started. Here are some good blogs:   www.virtualsatyr.blogspot.com  (a very funny blog)   www.poop_eatery.blogspot.com  (a movie review blog)  Also I would like to say that I saw Troy and it sucked donkyballs I mean its not even like the legends come on what the hell is this piece of crap? Shit yes. Maybe from a poodle but still!I will give a review of Troy another day.    EATING WITH BEATLES     Paul is dead?   Well, I don't think he is. Here are some things the beatles said to us lets look through some albums   The Magical Mistery Tour   Look at the front Cover and we see all the beatles dressed up in costumes. Paul Macartney is dressed in a walrus outfit. A walrus symbolizes death. Now go to track 06, the song "I am the Walrus". If you listen to the song it would sound like it is someone who is mad and dying talking. I also think That paul sang it. I don't know if he did or not. This is what the title means " I am dead". Actualy "I am the Walrus" is my favorite bealtle song.   The White Album   This is a great Album. Anyways turn to track 03 'Glass onion" and listen to these Lyrics referring to " I am the Walrus". It's  " I told you about the walrus and me-man  You know that we're as close as can be-man  Well here's another clue for you all  The walrus was Paul. "  You see! You see!   Abbey Road   this one mainly is the Album cover. Look at the beatles. They are all dressed in different outfits. And hey wait a minute all these outfits surround death! John Lennon is dressed as a priest. George is in a grave digger outfit. Ringo is in a mourner's outfit. Lets take a look at Paul. Paul has no shoes on symbelizing bareness as if he was dead. He has a cigarette in his hand because normally smokers die. And lastly, he is walking with right foot first while everyone else has theyre left foot first.That means that he is different = Out of this World = dead. And the last thing in this album cover is look at the car at the left side.On the back plate it says 28if meaning 28 if he lived as in Paul is dead and if he was alive he'd be 28.   Pretty crazy, eh?     She Bang! She Bang! Oh baby, she move! She move!   well theyre goes another crazy day, I hoped you liked todays edition of THE WALL.  Curent Favorite Song: Heartbreaker by the Rolling Stones  Quote of the day:  "Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jeff. Jeff didn't like his family too well. They treated him like he was dirt. Jeff was also not liked at school. That's because Jeff was the next Hitler. Yeah, everybody knew it. At 8 years old, Jeff was already readin Mein Kampf. Jeff also liked to play out in the middle of the street. Yep, Jeff loved it out there. In fact, Jeff wanted to know what it would be like to get hit by a car...   At least that's the story I told myself after I ran him over. "  - Virtual Satyr from www.virtualsatyr.blogspot.com   Some Last Notes    I just go this Link From Virtual Satyr that will explain more about Paul being Dead then I can ever know. I still dont beleive hes dead. I would like to thank Virtual Satyr for the link.   http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/3674/pid.html

        Play Review: The Count of Monte Cristo    performed at Stratford Shakesperian Festivel at Stratford,Ontario    First half:  Hmmmmmmmmm... the first half was quite good. Somethings I did not enjoy in it though. The acting wasnt too great. It was really slow paced, it is was not meant to be slow paced but it was. It was also pretty stupid the story wasnt that good and straightforward.It was like a poser. It was a wannabe of something its not. I have to admit the story is great. But the translation did not work for this play though. I give first half a C because the play still had a chance to be good.   Second half:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! AHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!! As the man from www.poop_eatery.blogspot.com said this is one of those things were you just want to shake the direcctor till he has sudden death disorder ( unfortuantely,it doesent exist)! Well, it does pick up at the second half but still AHHHHHHHHHH!!!! AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!!!!!!! It was getting good then bam the bomb drops and everything goes with it. The fighting wasnt even that great. the sets were actualy good. The Ending was extrememly weak. And the translation still sucked ass. Thats a lesson don't translate something from a book inless you know what you are doing! The movie was much better then this.The movie was extrememly well done. So I will review it another day.But in the movie everything was alot smarter.  I mean in this Stratford editon, Where the Fuck is the suspense??  You call this a stratford play? This is more like one of those plays the grade ones put on about the seasons! I give this half a C. This play is worse then one of those poorly made " for TV" movies. This play is a NO NO so DONT SEE IT, IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!   Overall score:  2.2/5.0   Im sorry to tell you, but the Common theatre is ill, it has problems.   I don't get it. This performance was sold out right. How come Macbeth wasnt sold out? This isnt even that well know even as a novel and it isnt even decent while macbeth is an amaizing play and they put on an amaizing performance of it.And plus "Count" isnt even really a play its a freaking book, do you know hpow hard it is to translate book to play?!  The reason is of the selling out is people.People. Us humans are moslty stupid and idiot so we watch stupid and idiotic plays. People are so stupid that they cant even know a decent anything is it slaps them in the face.This play was garbage. But people as i said before are too stupid to watch decent plays they want to see something simple.Modern theatre. Well here's a newsflash, Nothing is simple buddy! Or nothing simple is good....either way.  Checkhov's play "Seagull" couldnt have said it better:   "as far as I'm concerned the theatre today is all delusion. When the curtain goes up, and those great talents, those priests of sacred art, show how people,eat,drink,love,walk and wear their jackets; when they take simple lines and predictable situation and try to sqeeze a moral out of them, a smug, homespun, oversimplified sort of moral; when they serve up the same thing in a thousand variations, over and over again-then all I can do is run, flee, afraid it's vulgarity will wear down my brain" . "Count" was modern theatre.   The "Count" over and done with and so is the day   well to end things off I just want to say my class is doing a play onm June 3rd. Don't worry its not modern theatre. If you live in Toronto and want to see it post a coment and Ill tell you where it is. It is a very smart play.  Quote of the day:  "Freedom is Slavery. Peace is War.

      Hey Everybody sorry I couldnt post for a while. Today Im going to Stradford to see 2 plays; The Count of Monte Cristo and Macbeth. Ill review them when I'm back tommorow If I can. I can't think of much to do today. One reason is that Today Is boring and I'm really hateful and a little bit depressed for some reasons. Somewhere Along the way I just became an Atheist.Yesterday I saw Shrek 2. It was insanely funny.In it there is a Man-slave and a transvetite. Ill review it later but not today.     Goodbye for now   Quote of the day:  "It wasnt Murder, it was execution"  from Witness for the prosecution.A great movei.

      I saw the Lady Vanishes Last night. Ill get back to you later on it.  Anyways, promised you them and here they are    Review: Kill Bill Vol.1    We all were waiting for Quentins next film but the question is, was it worth the wait?  Yes, it was. Now I'll tell you why   Acting:  I actualy really liked the acting. It never got on my neurves. I thought Uma Thurma, David Cannadine ( Bill) did a fantastic job. I also really liked Lucy Lu ( I don't know how to spell her name. She played Oren-ishii) Daryl Hannah(Elle Driver) and Vicia V. Fox ( I think thats her name. Sorry if its not. She played Vernita green). But for vernita green I think she sweared al little to much " I fucked you over, I fucked you over good. I know I fucked you over. But I wish I hadnt fucked you over, Bitch". But there werent any super strong acting in it though so I will give it an -A ( A minus dimwits)   Story:  The world is divided into two parts. Those who love Quentin Tarrantino and those he hate him. I think Ive found my part in the loving.This story was great. The script was great smart almost flawless but again ( I do love swearing, and I read the script online) In the script they swear every Fucking single line. Mostly Bitches and Fuck, Bitches, Fuck, Fuck,Fuck. Mostly the ladys do the talking.But swearing doesent matter that much. Well and the script was amaizing it wasnt El Perfect. So I give it an -A.   Direction:  This is definatly the strongest part of the movie. It's amaizing Quentin can make Violence funny. But the thing is its not! I dont even think there was an overuse of violence. The film really should have been rated 14A. But anyways the direction ruled how they talked the movements. Perfect!Also the lighting was amaizing. He made everything into his own world. The colours sometimes were so bright that they were disturbing. He gives you the exact feel he wants you to have.Colours: Perfect! And oh boy the camera, that sure is a treat. The splits, the shots are amaizing. How can only see Bills body on a chair with a sword in his hand. And how sometimes the colours change to black and white to give you the exact feel.Everything seems so perfectly twisted.And how can I forget the animation scene. Perfectly animated.Lastly, the music. The music doesent let you down. Again its perfect! This is why Im on the Quentin part of the earth. I give Direction an A+.  Here is my Overall score: 3.8/5.0  Note: I only pretty much watch good movies and you are allowed to tell me a movie that you want me to review and Ill do it. Just put it in the Comments   To Finish a Bloody story off...   current favorite song: "Stairway To Heaven" by Led Zeppelin   Quote of the day:  "Dying is easy, Comedy is not" -Sir Edmond Kean

       Kind Hearts and Coronets   Hey everyone instead of  " The Lady Vanishes"  last night I watched the british comedy  " Kind hearts and Coronets" . It was extremely well done It was also very funny. It explained itself the best  " A hilarious study on the gentle art of MURDER".   It is about a man who in order to inherit his dukeship must kill his relatives standing before him. It has a great ending. Let me recount how he kills them.  1. The person is in a row boat with his wife The main character Louie takes away the paddles and watches as they drift away of a waterfall.  2. He befriends him but then Louie put gasoline all over the garden house and burns it down whn the guy is in it.  3. Louie meets the preacher he has a drink with the preacher. When the preacher is going back to get some cigars he poisons the preachers drink.  4. This person is Lady Agatha a feminist movement leader. Louie had to help getting her out of prison to kill her. After she gets out and gets freed she goes into an air baloon. Louie quickly goes to his apartment window with a bow and arrow and shoots the baloon down.  5. This person is nice and Louie didnt want to kill him. This guy was a banker and was old so he had a heart attack.  6. The ship guy. Louie takes control of a ship and runs it into the ship guys ship sinking both.  7. The general. The general is at a restaraunt. Louie pretends to be a waiter. He puts some gun powder into what looks like a can of marmalade and gives it to the general. The general opens it and BOOM! Pop goes the weasel.  8. The duke himself. Louie goes hunting with the duke and sets up a bear trap. The duke gets caught in the bear trap. Quickly Louie takes the dukes Shotgun and blows the dukes head off.  All of those 8 relatives are played by Alec Guiness. No joke.   Now an update on Kill Bill Vol.3   Kill Bill Vol.3 is going to happen in 15 years ( WHY GOD? WHAT DID I DO TO ANGER YOU???????). Well actualy because they need time for the actor who played Nicki to grow up. Nicky is Vernita Greens daughter. It will probaly be called KILL THE BRIDE. Well I still have to find a way to see Vol.2 because I'm younger then 18.     Now for the song quote    " New Orleans is sinking and I don't want to swim"   - New Orleans is Sinking by The Tragicly Hip  coming soon... A review of Kind Hearts and Coronets and the best movies, game systems, and video games of 2003!

      Alright fellow moviegoers.One of my favorite movies which I recomend you all to see is " The Manchurian Canditate". It was brainwashing, the Korean war and more. Don't let the black and white scare you away. But a couple of weeks ago I was reading through a friends magazine and then I saw a article about a remake of " The Manchurain Canditate"!It is supposed to be modernized and instead of the Korean War, The Gulf Wat. Denzel Washington is playing the main character and the insane mother is being played by Meryl Streep.I saw a trailer for it at  urlLink   . And it looked weird and awesome. It's coming out July 30. I doubt it willl be better then the first one though but I still think it will be good. This is a movie to watch.  And Also go to  urlLink   If you lke funny stuff. Go to cartoons, then go to Kill Bill & Ted. It is hilarious and stupid... AND TED??????????????  Ive found out that there is going to be a Kill Bill vol.3! Violence fans and psychos rejoice!   (Well the psychos only do because they want ot find out more ways to kill people " Please sir, put that Hakana down")  Anyways I've discovered a new great song by Velvet Revolver( Guns & Roses without AXL and this new swinger that is really Fucked up)It is called slither. I tried to download it on Kazaa but all I got was another song because people mistook the name so I just downloaded the video. If you see the video you know what I really mean by Fucked up!   Lastly, tonight I'm watching the Hitchcock movie " The Lady Vanishes". Ive seen some of it and it is good so far.   Coming soon... A review of Kill Bill!  "Yeah, here comes the water It comes to wash away the sins of you and I Each time, you see. . ." - Slither by Velvet Underground  See...smart lyrics too :)

        Le Eli et Ici.Time for some creative writing.  True part  Alright yesterday At night I was at this party and there was a reaggae band playing there and they were really good. But I noticed something very strange theyre drummer wasnt a complete jackass! He wasnt drumming as loud as he could! He was actualy good!  False part ...why does it have to be false :(   Me and my band ( Spontaniusly Combusting Children) searched for why this was so. It was realy spooky. Me and the gang split up. We created a trap we but beer all over his drum set and farther awy in a line so hed drum slip fall and fall down the floor into a sticky web and bellow was Lava. But suddemly the other part of the gang were looking around and Drew lost his glasses. The drummer almost had him my beating the drums so lightly quickly Robert took his drum sticks and banged the drums causing Pampa the panda who was tackling the drummer to be the one who slipped. Unfortunately, it turned out that the web was not strong enough to hold a spider.So our Panda fell into lave and died. We mourned and then said " What would quentin Tarrantino do?". And we found out what to do................  TO BE CONTINUED..................oh screw it I'm finnishing it now!  Adam took his base tore off the tuner part and there was a blade. I tore the tuner part of my guitar and it was a machine gun. Then Dimitri did the same with his guitar and it just became a plastic baseball bat. We gave him another guitar and it bacame and Adrienilen Needle. We just decided for him to use the plastic baseball bat. Phillip our keyboard player played rush for a weapon. We had to have earplugs or we'd die.Then at the same time we all atacked the drummer. The rush music killed him. His head popped off like God was squeezing his stomzch as hard as he could.Bllod srited out like a firehose that couldnt stop and was out of control. Then he had a very spontiaus Combustion which was very bloody. And by Very I mean like putting 20 people in a small white room in one space then mosing them down with a Minigun. Then suddenly an Alien Spontaniusly Apperared! He said hello I am an Alien guitarist who just wanted to try the drums. We said "oh" and carried on with our lives.

Billy Talent-  Billy Talent  Score: 3.5/5 Talented Guys name Billy   Velvet Revolver-  Contra Band  Score: 3.5/5 Revolvers made out of Velvet  Both good Debut Cds. It's amaizing how good they are for they are each bands first Cd. Expet that almost all the guys in  Velvet  have played in a band before. These Bands Include,  Stone Temple Pilots  and  Guns & Roses . Slash is in  Velvet .   Trip Review- Montreal Brown School Graduation Trip   This trip was pretty freaking fun. There were some faults and I'll name them off for my review.  1. Food. The best food we had was only half decent and everything else was  godawful   2. El Free Time. Oh come on we only had an hour to visit each other's rooms. They should have given us at minimum 2 hours  3. El Free Time 2. Us males were not aloud to go to th e Female floor for some absurd reason. Its not like were going to beat the girls, rape them and fuck any single female we see. Were Kids not life sentence prisoners!  4. Inconsiderate. The Teacher's were so fucking inconsiderate about the kids. They were so freaking protective over some of the kids it's scary. You can't even chose your own rooms. You'll probaly end up with Boy Goerge and Micheal Jackson for all I know. Maybe they should actualy look at what people wanted for rooms and used that for an example instead of using only one Loser kids paper of who he wants to be with. If you don't want to be with some on and everyone who your going to be with puts that down on your paper no matter what you'll be with that person. The teachers say " Oh we don't want to hurt this person's feelings". Well here is some news, Sherlock, If you put that  LOSER  with the three people he wants to be with, they'll be unhappy. Let's see , what do you rather, one unhappy person or three? The Teacher's always go with answer B.  Also the Teachers pick the movies and when they vote they dont put the exact name of the film mistaking people so they vote for it. And the Movie that we voted for was three freaking hours and lasted to the end of the way home while only two people were watching it and everyone who voted for it were rioting for it to be turned off.  5. One of the trips to one of the museums was pretty boring the guy who was talking to us had a bad voice for acting and did not understand what he was sayong. He even got some things wrong. He thought that the First Nations were alergic To alchohol. He thought that all of them were! Try none of them.  Overall Score: 3.6/5 Greyhound Buses going to everywhere in Montreal and going back to Toronto   Im Bored by your story Grandma.....Shut up now   Quote of the day:  "I don't know Because she says so He's a f*gg*t boy The TV says so He's a junkie piece of shit because he says so  All that first-class jet set brings me down, down, down All that first-class drug shit brings me down, down, down  It's a big machine, it's a big machine We're all slaves to a big machine It's a big machine, it's a big machine We're all slaves to a big machine All tied up to a big machine"  - Big Machine by Velvet Revolver  Note: I know I shouldnt have kept that word in their I did put marks in it so it doesent reveal the whole thing. That part is basicly saying how the goverment, media is destroying us and brianwashing us in a way.

       Movie Review:    SuperSize Me    Overall: This movie may not look good in the Ads but this is  one good movie . I mean, just watch it. It's scary because it's real and the script is incredibly clever and smart.You literly need to see this, not only is it well done, it helps us laugh and it tells us the dangers of Fast Food. This film is really about how America has grown to be the Fast Food Nation, how the corupt buisnesses took over. How us people have doomed ourselves to a certain death. So I say Supersize this movie!   Score:   3.6 Supersized meals out of 5      Nosferatu    Overall: One Word. Classic. This may be from a long time ago but that doesent stop it from being so good. I mean, the camera work is extrodinarie, it is just overall brilliant. It is better then praticly all the films made today. At some points it even gets pretty Freaky. This one of those movies that just are a wonder. It is like The Battle Ship Potemkin both very very wonderous because they are so good and made at such an early time.   Score:  3.5 Bloodthirsty Vampires out of 5     Monty Python and the Holy Grail    Overall: Arguably the best "Python" film but unfortunately I say Second. This is one of the most enjoyed films of the century. Why? Because it's so funny and it apeals to anybody. It has a certain sense of humor that everyone likes. It is all the types of funny(stupid,clever,silly,etc). Some scenes in it are just classic and you'll remember them till you die. Also they always have clever conclusions. A great ending, a great ending to the palns,, stuff like that. One thing that I really liked about this movie is that it has all these different storys. It's a Monty Python Midevil version of Pulp Fiction. However, it came out before Pulp Fiction! I say you should see this film, you will like it. Unless, you were abducted by Aliens of course.   Score:   3.3 Holy Grails out of 5   Let us take a moment of slience to praise Monty Python and their Greatness. Amen.   The Being Sorry in the act of Sorryness   I'm sorry to tell you all this but I'll be at Montreal for the next three days and a half. I'm coming back at about 5 at thursday.  Quote of the day:  "School's out for summer School's out forever School's been blown to pieces"  - School's out by Alice Cooper. If only it was so , someday, someday * looks into the sky full of hope*.

      History, yeah thats right, history. Face it. Canadian History pretty much sucks.We do have some Good tidbits but our history still sucks.  Hey! Quit Laughing America because your history  is just as bad .  Well I am learning History in class and I got a great Idea for a home made film. Well, Mockumentry really   It Shall be named:  Canada: The history, the reasons why we don't suck....awwwww who am I kidding?   Its a fake Mockumentry of Canadian history. It will have some stuff making fun of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. And don't worry SARS will be in it! I still have to learn completely everyhting that I can do on my camera.   CHATBOX!!!!   Ya that's right a chatbox, don't be hating the chatbox. It would be good for Coments on the overall blog. I'm going to make soon a blog called Brown Awards it will be for giving away awards some good and bad to people in my class. My class votes. Majority wins!!!!!1     The Comedy of Death, Destruction and horror    Monty Python is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. Go see it.   Well, today Ill review one of their movies!!!!! The rest will be reviewed another day.   And Now for Something Completely Diferent   Overall: By the first five minutes you'll be on the ground laughing so hard that milk will be falling out of your nose ( even though you didnt drink any milk).There is no plot as you can see by the name " And Now for Something Completely Diferent". It is Something completely Diferent. It is a remix of all their best sketchs. This has to be the funniest ( clever funny) movie I've ever seen. It's so clever and stupid. It is amaizingly well sone. It doesent matter that it doesent have a plot what it does is create all these different storys and melt them into a path. If you don't like this movie it means that you get bored easily, you probaly are stupid and ignorant and you dont know a fucking movie if it splaps you in the face!!!!!  Score:  3.4 out of five completely different things    Ps. the Sound is really good the cartoons are amaizing and funny. This does not go wrong anywhere. It is a one of a kind.In my opinion it is the best Monty Python film.    This is the end, my friend   Well, its the end for today. Don't get your hopes up, Kurt Cobain!  Quote of the day:  "Imagine there's no heaven, It's easy if you try, No hell below us, Above us only sky, Imagine all the people living for today...  Imagine there's no countries, It isnt hard to do, Nothing to kill or die for, No religion too, Imagine all the people living life in peace...  Imagine no possesions, I wonder if you can, No need for greed or hunger, A brotherhood of man, Imagine all the people Sharing all the world...  You may say Im a dreamer, but Im not the only one, I hope some day you'll join us, And the world will live as one."  - Imagine by John Lennon

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room  Only to find Gideon's bible  Rocky had come equipped with a gun  To shoot off the legs of his rival  His rival it seems had broken his dreams  By stealing the girl of his fancy.  Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil  But everyone knew her as Nancy.  Now she and her man who called himself Dan  Were in the next room at the hoe down  Rocky burst in and grinning a grin  He said Danny boy this is a showdown  But Daniel was hot-he drew first and shot  And Rocky collapsed in the corner.   Now the doctor came in stinking of gin  And proceeded to lie on the table  He said Rocky you met your match  And Rocky said, Doc it's only a scratch  And I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able.   Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room  Only to find Gideon's bible  Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt  To help with good Rocky's revival. "    And a .....errr.....well I cant promise anything......... mediocre   day to you all!

       Ok, I just came back from camp and I had a pretty good time. The think is, I'm going to Montreal in a few hours and I'm coming back in four days. Anyways, I saw some&nbsp;movies right after camp. They are City of God, Spiderman 2 and Farenheight 9/11. Here are the  Reviews:     &nbsp;    City of God:  3.9/5 stars.      Note:  The Best movie of 2003     &nbsp;  Spiderman 2: 3.0/5 stars   Note: Better then the first but it did not have a strong ending.    &nbsp;  Farenheight 9/11: 2.9/5 stars   Note: Had a strong ending, This movie is not meant to be a good movie but it's meant to be information that the public should now.
