      watching deep impact... wat a depressing movie... elijah wood is in it and he just proposed to a girl (although they're in high skool) so he can save her!!!!! awww... i'd say no.. give me the other hobbit!  haha.. i concure about the whole plastic surgery thing... seriously... how ugly do u have to feel to do that? and my sister and i were talking cause there's this girl who got plastic surgery and she's not that pretty even now.. so we were thinking.. exactly how ugly do u think she felt to be content with a crappy surgery job? (trust me, u can tell u she got surgery and everything) the singing points are definitely bonus points to robert schwartzman!!!! I CANNOT BEILEVE U GOT A FONE! seirously... that's exciting! i'm gonna definitely call u when&nbsp;i get home.. so i hope ur not planning on sleeping early or something like that! oooOOOOooo.. elijah wood got married! sick.. his wife is leelee sobieski... aww.. maybe they'll divorce if&nbsp; elijah wood can't save her parents!! PLEASE!!!!!! aww.. he luvs her soo much!!! and she's staying with her parents... nerd!!! given elijah wood isn't my favorite person.. still! wat kinda idiot marries and says.. nm! i'll stay with my parents.. that's far too sad.. and i feel like crying so i need some alone time now...  this really is a lame movie... *tear*

      yeah, it is sad--whoa! i dont like this crazy font...oh well. anyways...it is sad how people get plastic surgery just becasue they feel ugly or fat or whatever. if you dont care how you look, other people shouldnt care either! hmmph. oh--and of course hugh dancy is hotter than robert schwartzman. duh. i just prefer robert becuase he sings&nbsp;real good and is cute.

      man.. blog has been upgraded tons... now there's different fonts and stuff! how exciting! i can make a list and everything.. i'll make a list of my productive morning:   i woke up to talk to my dad on the fone  i brushed my teeth  i ate breakfast  i went on the computer  i'm watching tv AND typing on the computer...   WHOO HOO!!!! that's fun...  MAN!!! new things i just learned... if you change ur diet drastically and become constipated... u might have to remove ur large intestines! EEK! and then if u eat too many really spicy and salty stuff, that could lead to stomach cancer, and then... if your wisdom teeth grow weird under ur gums, then it traps water in it or something and ur jaw can break one day, and then if ur stressed and you brain doesn't recoginize it, it can lead to depression  and did u kno that depression is contagious? so lesson learned, don't hang out with stressed people... it's bad for ur health!  and the rain in korea is so acid because of the pollution that the rain can cause u to go bald if u get hit with it too much.. haha.. that's funny..  random facts that i thought u&nbsp;would like to hear.. but somehow, i don't think it would...  is it just me or is not blog working? i can't see the blog so i have to go to edit posts to see wat other people wrote.. just me or not?   hm... yeah.. u need to update more often... i'm bored... and sadly, i don' have a laser pen to keep me entertained..   welps.. i'm gone...

      haha.. the second one does look lame.. *sigh* no use watching it! sooo.. i'm not! and i'll just watch ella enchanted ne ways! (plus... i'm soriee jordyn.. hugh dancy is much hotter then robert schwartzman! don't kill me! instead.. think of it as now u don't have to beat me down to claim him! and i don't have to beat u down to claim hugh dancy! whoo hoo!) hm... still! i guess the er thing wouldn't have bothered if harry potter had said it throughtout the series.. but in the fourth book.. it just got really annoying cause he kept saying er for wat it seemed like no apparent reason.. and then we get the shaft when harry potter figures out the riddle.. watever... i got the kewlest headfones in the world! actually.. tjhey're not that great.. but there's this padding and it's weeiiirrrdddd~~~~~ haha... speaking of will smith... (actually.. the part where us said willie) i was watching just married a couple days ago.. my second favorite part of that movie (after the part where britney murphy goes didn't u used to have fantasies about weddings? or something like that and then ashton kutcher has a flash bak of playing star wars with his friends) is that part where that guy says we're gonna send the dogs on u! or something like that and ashton kutcher says bring it on willie!!!! man.. i forgot that part.. and for the record.. i thought of home.. and now i'm doubly homesick.. lol saddest thing i've heard aaaaaalllllllll day... so i'm guessing at leat 70% to 85% of the really good looking actors/actresses/singers have all gotten surgery in korea!!! AHHH! isn't that sad? it's disgusing too! i mean.. okay... there's one actress who's literally gotten everything in her face fixed... there's one singer who was sorta chubby and then lost a whole bunch of weight for her second cd by going to this place where u only drink water and work out and eat only wat's needed and then when she came out agian this year to put out her solo album i almost had a heart attack cause she didn't even look like her due to soo much surgery, and one singer got his lips surgerized (that is not a word. but it sounded write for my ranting) and then one actor that i thought was somewhat cute ended up getting tons of surgery done to his face! AHHHHHH!!!!!!! and then there's that transexual.... *shudder* and everyone else has gotten surgery on their eyes for a double eyelid.. *sigh* watever... i'm just saddened but the great amount of people who got surgery... welps! that was enough for my ranting and ravings for the day.. sooo looong!!!!!  (24 days till i go home and 9 days till king arthur comes out!!!!)

      um, i think the 'er' sound is not so much actually sounding like it looks. i think its more like 'eh' or something, because in books all the time they write 'er'. and ive never heard anyone say that for real. or maybe it soiunds like 'erm' or something, which i actually say quite often.   anyways, yesterday at teh library i found the best cd ever: will smith: 'big willie style'!!! with "getting jiggy wit it" and such. yess!!! i rule.   not really loooking forward to princess diearies 2. it looks lame adn stupid. plus ROBERT SCWARTZMAN IS NOT IN IT. jerk, he's abandoned me. and NOT for moira, she was clearly hallucinating. "goo goo eyes" my face! (it would've sounded too repetitive to say 'my eye'.)

      and wat happens if i dont luv it?????!!!! huh? HUH!??? okay;.. soriee.. i'm going hysterical.. i'm a little tired and i'm like.. ACK!!!!!!  i had something meaningful to say.. but i'll end with saying.. do people really say er? cause in harry potter.. he was like.. er... er... wait a minute, er! spyer spyer.. spider! my question is that people don't really say er... so if he didn't really say er, he never would've found out that riddle.. and for the record.. he never said er until the fourth book... *sigh* watever..

      doi!!! of course i knew that gerard butler (man.. wat a sexy accent) was doing phantom of the opera! i told u before, remember? i was freaking out cause katie holmes was rumored to play christine and i was really really mad cause i had heard her sing in abandoned and she didn't have the voice required for christine (it was while we were studying for finals.. and then we had a discussion on katie holmes.. remember?) and i'm really really curious about whether or not gerard butler can sing.. hm.. but!!!! i didn't kno that it was coming out this winter! i thought it was coming out next year! (man.. pirates of the carribean 2 is supposed to come out next year.. please tell me they gave up on the project.. cause i dont think the second one can match to the first one)  um.. u wrote some other stuff.. but i forgot wat..  JEALOUS!!!!!!!! i wanna see i luv the 90s! oh welps.. i'll have to live without it.. i just finished a depressing korean anime... it makes me sad.. i'm too upset to think about it.. and it was a HORRIBLE ending cause we don't even kno wat happens to the main character's brother and this girl that pregnant with his baby! *sigh* watever..... and we never find out if he's gay with his best friend.. but i think he was... hm.... weird... ne ways!!!!!!! i'm going to go now.. man! king arthur's not coming out for another days! not till 23 or 24 or the 25th!

      why ARE there titles? that's strange. anyway, i thought you'd be interested in the fact that in the movie phantom of the opera that's coming out this winter (i think), gerard butler will play the phantom. on the downside (if there is one), they will have to make him real deformed for the part. i can dig it. speaking of me digging things, I LOVE THE 90S PREMIERES TOMORROW. i hope i get to watch it. maybe i can sneak upstairs to my parents room and watch it. holler.

      i luv pop shove it! and i feel truly blessed to be part of this blog.. man! wanna kno the sad part? i totally forgot the names!!!! i remember: stuart kennsington (how can i forget) mike shwartz (is that right?) xander mounds (heheh...) and i can't remember the other 2 cause they were urs and i felt the need not to remember them! ne ways.. to further explain my morgenstern ordeal.. in the princess bride book, did u read the introduction? it was about william golding being read this book by morgenstern by his father at a young age and how he gave the book to his son (none edited) and his son hated it so william goldman decided to abridge the whole thing so his son could enjoy it. and then re writes on the the original was never published in america and how everyone was mad at his abridgement beacuse it didn't stay true to florin history...  so throughout the book, he has cut ins about wat he took out and wat the critics were saying.. and so i automatically thought.. hey! morgenstern must be real! i wanna visit florin! and i wanna read the original story! and i wanna kno wat this "true story" is!" so i go on google.. and i look up, florinese history, princess bride.. and up comes cliff notes! so i go there.. and there's a list of facts.. and it says... written my goldman under then false name of morgenstern.. and i was like.. wat? so i look at the other categories.. and i find out! that!!!! morgenstern isn't real and goldman merely pretended that there was one just for the purpose of pretending.. and then they go on saying that many readers truly believe that morgenstern is real cause goldman has those anecdotes and crap... man! i started laughing at myself.. it was a great day that day.. and i TOLD u that hugh dancy was freaking hot! the other 2 are okay.. but frankly, hugh dancy is the one that makes me choke.. he's sooo hot!  welps.. i'll go now! hope u're not to bored ne more! cause that'd be sad! i'm here now! haha.. hope that didn't make u run away scared.. welps1 bai!
