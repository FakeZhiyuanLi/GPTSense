      My first article, complete with byline, was submitted to Family-Content.com today!  http://www.family-content.com/articles/data/20040712122136.shtml  Self-Rejuvenation for Women Jessica Roberts, Owner Little One Letters & Cakes http://www.LittleOneLetters.com  If you are reading this right now you probably want some time to relax, right? Some “me” time? Great! Read on. Getting time for you isn’t easy anymore. Carpools, deadlines, and obligations all eat up our valuable “me” time. Add that to spending time with family, managing a household and running an at-home business, and it’s a recipe for a “me meltdown”. Here are four ways to take back some time for self rejuvenation!   1. Set aside 30 minutes a week and call it your Spa Retreat. Maybe you aren’t really into pedicures and facials, but a nice hot bath, your favorite candle scent and a good magazine can not be beat! Lock the bathroom door and simply enjoy.   2. Spend a lot of time in the family minivan? Borrow your favorite books on tape from the local library. Running errands may not be your favorite way to spend Saturday morning, but a book on tape allows you to take a favorite author and novel along for the ride.   3. Exercise!?! Yes, you read that right, exercise! Take 15 minutes a day and get moving. Exercise is not only good for the body, but good for the soul. If you have young children, include them, they’ll love it!   4. P-A-R-T-Y with the girls! Sometimes our mom/wife/business owner side just needs to let down her hair and hang with her girlfriends. Try to set up one night a month for just the ladies. Not only will it feel good to be out, it’ll feel good to just be a woman for one night.    Don’t sell yourself short! Me time is valuable; make a date with yourself to rejuvenate TODAY! You’ll be glad you did!   This article may be republished with complete byline.

      SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is currently the thorn in my side for getting Little One Letters & Cakes "finished".  It seems I keep hearing something new and different from every person online that I meet.  I joined a free Yahoo SEO Group to try and gleam some information, and feel more lost now than ever.    I'm working hard on getting some link exchanges and doing free advertising where I can to get Little One Letters & Cakes visible to others online.  I need to make up new flyers and get them hanging around town.  It was recommended to have a Blog as a way to get backlinks, so I'm trying it out.  I don't know what it will do for business, but it can't hurt, can it?  Jessica Little One Letters & Cakes http://www.LittleOneLetters.com Greeting Cakes for EVERY Occasion! Ind. Greeting Cake Dist.
