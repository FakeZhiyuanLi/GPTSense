      One thing............  Restless tonight cause  I wasted the light between both these times  I drew a really thin line  It’s nothing, I planned  And not that I can  But you should be mine  Across that line  If I traded it all  If I gave it all away for one thing  Just for one thing if I sorted it out  If I knew all about this one thing wouldn’t that be something  I promise I might not walk on by  Maybe next time but not this time  Even though I knowI don’t want to know  Yeah I guess I knowI just hate how it sounds

       When I stole a twig from our little nest   And gave it to a bird with nothing in her beak  I had my balls and my brains put into a viceAnd twisted around for a whole fucking week.  Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you let that trash  Get a hold of your cock, get stoned on my hash ?  Why'd ya do it she said, why'd you let her suck your cock ?  Oh, do me a favour, don't put me in the dock.  Why'd ya do it, she said, they're mine all your tools,  You just tied me to the mast of the ship of fools.  Why'd ya do it, she said, when you know it makes me sore,  Cause she had cobwebs up her fanny and I believe in giving to thepoor.  Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you spit on my snatch ?Are we out of love now, is this just a bad patch ?  Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did ?  You drove my ego to a really bad skid.  Why'd you do it, she said, ain't nothing to laugh,  You just tore all our kisses right in half!  Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd ya do what you did,  Betray my little oyster for such a low bid.  Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did ?  You drove my ego to a really bad skid.  Why'd ya do it, she screamed, after all we've said  Every time I see your dick I see her cunt in my bed.  The whole room was swirling,  Her lips were still curling.  Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did  Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did  Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd ya do it, she said,  Why'd you do what you did ?  Oh, big grey mother,  I love you forever  With your barbed wire pussy and your good and bad weather.  Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did ...Ah, I feel better now.   Why'd you do it - Marianne faithful / Broken English

      Things to remember ..........   1. Never give disillusioned insane friends the password to your blog -&nbsp;because anything rational appears disillusioned and insane to me.  2. Always be very careful about who you ask for help....... Wouldn't want to owe someone everything you have...........  Would rather stay in the insane sad little world I live in.  It's like visiting the carnival everyday!  3. Give consideration to forfeiting "the bet" - the $150 may be well worth releasing the ever increasing pressure on my brain (my mental medication just doesn't cut it on it's own) and I am&nbsp;destined to lose anyway.  4. Send friend link to Dr.Phil's website; perhaps his greatness will rub off on Phil (although I haven't quite figured out how giving him Phil's link will allow anything to rub off on Phil)  5. Tell said friend you love him .......... :) Whoever you may be.  6. I must remember to pre-pran. 7. Thank God for editors.

      Boy they better have spell check on here.................   July 7 2004   My conversations with Jim consistently leave me with either a pain from laughing too hard or a pain in head; in most cases it is both.  Like too much salt on an expensive cut of perfectly grilled meat ...... His conversations leave you feeling painfully satisfied that you understood what he was saying but there is always the after taste of something more............  Water sometimes helps.    For the past year I have been very slowly and painfully been getting over a bad break-up. This break-up was different from the others in my past and I truly wanted to take the time I needed to discover why I allowed myself to get here in the first place.   My friends of course have helped me through this process every step of the way, each adding there own flavor of support. While the majority of my friends give me hugs when I need one or help me cry in beer to forget, Jim took on the role of helping me look inside. At first I was scared to go there but I really have truly learned so much about myself this year and I owe a lot of it to our sarcastically insightful, truthful and sometimes bitter and jaded conversations late at night.   Recently I was wanting to set Jim up with a friend of mine........ He makes me laugh!!  to re-cap our conversation for prosperity and future reference see below.....   Re: Dating Younger Women    Jim: Yeah, she'll meet me and she might even like me, but after awhile she'll realize that I'm too old for her.    Karen: Oh come on, you have to get over the age thing.    Jim: That's easy for you to say. I'll be the one with a broken heart.    Karen: That's what I'm here for, to help mend broken hearts.   Jim:  Sure. That would be&nbsp;like a heroin addict offering to help someone get off crack.    Thanks man ........The check is in the mail.

      I keep having these disturbing dreams: My final days, the end of me. For some odd reason, I get one last wish, And every time, I wish for this:  Take me fast or take me slow. I don't really care how I go. In the daylight or in the dark, Just don't let me die of a broken heart.  The kind of pain that you just can't take, Will send a strong man to his grave. There's not a pill that can give you a rest, Or fill that hole deep in your chest.  So, take me fast or take me slow. I don't really care how I go. In the daylight or in the dark, Just don't let me die of a broken heart.   I've been crushed by that hurt before. There's no way I could take any more. If I fell in love, and I found out it would happen again, I'd say take me now.  And take me fast or take me slow. I don't really care how I go. In the daylight or in the dark, Just don't let me die of a broken heart. Take me fast or take me slow. I don't really care how I go. In the daylight or in the dark, Just don't let me die of a broken heart. No, don't let me die of a broken heart. No.

      Yes Evil Jim ... Is home, no phone calls yet , maybe he won't call , hopefully he met someone in Revelstoke hell he probably had a regular there anyway.........  1.5 hour hike around rice lake and the headwaters today , it was nice , I will have to do that more often , I even ran part of the way .  Scott and Melissa were over for dinner.  Other than that it has been a really quiet few days................ Not down today , just nice and mellow.  Really want to quit my job though...... I wish I could..... Hell I could work at Starbucks for a month or so .

      Dinner with Todd and Lisa tonight , Bryan and Todd hung out all night. The wedding is less than a month away , I am worried about Todd's anxiety I hope he gets it together or deals with it before the wedding. We had a long talk after everyone left, he is really having issues he needs to address.  No work out today ......... I wonder what the hell is wrong with me. Oh well tomorrow is another day right? The plan will be for a Mon - Fri workout schedule. I will force myself to blog my work-outs.  Anthony called me today............Told him he was a player and that he should come clean about his intentions with me because I am done "playing" hmmm strange he seemed to rise to the challenge , he even seemed a little worried. I suppose trying this celibate thing might work after all................  Jim ("Evil Jim" - my ex. Not "Good Jim" - my hero) will be home tomorrow........... I will not answer his calls  You are what you do!!! Not what you say you're going to do.
