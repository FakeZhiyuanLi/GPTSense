       The Evil Empire of GK   It has long been known that Gary Kinston, a.k.a. GK, is a lying liar who tells lies, and that his dictatorship, like so many others, is corrupt and full of injustice of all the freedoms granted to users of a message board. The unfortunate Hell from which he practices his power is called COWD, short for the Crazy Old Wizard's Domain. This board had---and still has---it's promises, and I have nothing against the board itself, nor does Proxima himself or the rest of his other staff members. It's just unfortunate that others still are under GK's harrassment.   What is fortunate, though, is that so far the Star Trek Community board (Proxima's board, which I am a mod at) has not been directly attacked recently. That is to say, GK's minions haven't stormed in and stuck their unwelcome noses in our business. Notice I said "recently". I know that Proxima is still getting crap from GK and his favorite DoctorSyn lately, ever since I checked his blog.   GK was even daring enough to bring up his own Star Trek board just to rival us. AdmiralMudd has decided to give GK a kick-in-the-crotch type of revenge by starting up his own board to make the compitition even worse. Luckily the good Admiral is one of us, and he will make an EzRing and a living hell even bigger for GK. All proceeds are welcome to the fund. ^_^  GK is most notorious for his dictator-like habits. He is known to ban people associated with other people he greatly dislikes (i.e. Proxima). He bullies members, sends out his staff to bully them further, and all at the same time making these people kiss his ass. If you so much as disagree with GK for something, he'll have his family bash you. This---and other sad examples---are the reason that many of his members have left him, and even a few members of his staff have begun to question their loyalty to him, since he is such an asshole to go as far as to beat down on them, too.   I know Proxima has more to say on GK and his evil regime, but that's another story and another blog.    ~Juno~ Current Mood: ANNOYED BUT...HAPPY    Some Good Clean Fun   The latest Newsweek made a chart refering to some bad, bad villians in our movie history, and here is their list of a few. I found it interesting, so I'll list and maybe give some thoughts. I put a few things that they said in the summary; the rest is mine.    Dr. No:  Yep, Agent 007's nemesis and starter. Tries to mess up the U.S. space program with missles. Very cold war. You'd think he'd learn his lesson with explosives. Naughty.    Ernst Stavro Blofeld:  Another Bond movie baddie. Couldn't get enough shiny things. Uses a killer laser satillite, which could totally happen today.    Scaramanga:  Yet another 007 nemesis. Love this guy since he's an assassin with a passion. Has a gun that can kill with one shot. Guess what color it is. His evil plan? Obtaining the Solex Agitator, which sounds like a fancy watch but is actually a device that turns the sun's radiation deadly. Well, when was it not?    Lex Luthor:  Perhaps the most notorious of all the megavillians and is also the dumpiest, if possible. He didn't care about taking over the world, he just wanted to kill Superman, which takes lots of kryptonite. Now he could just go on Ebay.    Max Zorin:  A loony French tycoon (Zorin is French?) with yellow hair and a supermodel chick. He's greedy 80's style: wants to detonate Silicon Valley, cause an earthquake, corner microchip market. Yeah, that'll work. Sure thing.    The Joker:  A criminal psychopath who falls into a vat of acid and comes out of it exactly the same way, only happier. His idea? Selling a line of cosmetics that's actually a lethal gas called Smilex. No animal testing! It causes cancer in rats.    The Penguin:  Abandoned by his parents because he was a really, really ugly baby. His only friends were penguins. Nice. He aims to hijack the mayoral election and install a crook. When that fails, he goes Biblical and tries to kidnap every firstborn son in Gotham. Time to get out the penguin's blood.    Dr. Evil:  Possibly the most comical of the group (beats the Joker), he is a cryogenically unfrozen villian who plots world domination with his cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, and his number two, Number Two. He's an oldie but a goodie: He steals a nuclear weapon (from Kreplakistan) and holds the world ransom for...ONE MEEL-LLION DOLLARS!    Magneto:  He's a mutant who's egar to wage war with nonmutants. His body is a magnet. O. The evil plan is...*drum roll*...to create a device to turn normal folks into mutants, and plans to use it on the world leaders at Ellis Island. Moral: racism=very, very bad.    The Green-Goblin:  The mad scientist that flies around on a stupid glider. When his super soldier project goes sour, he goes mad, starts talking to himself, puts on the suit and attacks Spidey. Tool.   I've added some that I've experienced in games and other such things. My own additions include:    Andross (from the Star Fox games):  Dr. Andross was a brilliant Cornerian scientist who went insane when his weaponry projects were turned down by the government due to the times of peace. So he unleashes his "weapons" among the citizens of Corneria, gets exiled to this hell planet called Venom, and strikes up an army (don't ask how) and attacks the Lylat System, planet by planet. So Star Fox has to stop him. What a bad, bad monkey.    Wolf O'Donnell (from the Star Fox games):  The least wimpy of the Star Wolf team and the Star Fox team's nemesis, Wolf is a cold...well, wolf...with an eyepatch and an attitude. Plans to take out Fox McCloud and his comrades before they get to Andross and destroy the plan. What a smart thing to do.    Lord Voldemort (from the Harry Potter series):  Now this guy's bad-to-tha-bone. Rises again and tries to kill off all the Muggles and non-pure bloods. Goody, and when he's done, let's have him take a census.    Darth Vader (from the Star Wars series):  I'm surprised this dude didn't make the list. He was as bad as bad comes. Okay, c'mon, he's a good-guy-gone-bad-guy-gone-good-guy again. Who doesn't love that? *wheezing*    Ganondorf (from the Legend of Zelda series) : This guy is a dark, dark guy...with red hair and pale-like skin. And yellow eyes. Has the Triforce of Power and has to share it with Link, who has the Triforce of Courage, and Princess Zelda, who has the Triforce of Wisdom. What happens when they clash? *rubs hands* A lotta chaos.   There are others, of course. Who can't resist an evil guy with an insane evil plan and crazy hair?    The Cold Front   Why is it so frickin' cold outside? It's suppost to be June and 80 something, not 50 something! Jeez laweez! I've never experienced anything like this. It's never been so chilly before, and the only time it was actually hot outside was the other day. But like everyone says, "There's no place like Nebraska." Damn right. >_   ~Valkyrie Juno signing off~

       I Love the 90's...But I'll Love It More Now    Oh my goodness gracious, will you look at that?! YAY! I Love the 90's starts on July 12 and I for one can hardly contain myself. I watched I Love the 80's like an idiot watches grass grow. Awesome stuff. Only this time I can remember crap. So...Hal Sparks, Michael Ian Black, Rachael Harris, and the rest of the crew are comin' back, and I can't wait to laugh my ass off. *grins*    In Other News    THE BEASTIE BOYS RETURN!  Sha-zam-an'-abra-kadabra!    Featured Music Videos    "Breaking the Habit" by Linkin Park   Okay, if you haven't seen the latest video from Lnkin Park, then I suggest you go to Yahoo Launch or something to see it, because it's just better. I loved this video for a number of reasons.   1. I am a huge, huge Linkin Park fan and have been from the very start.   2. It's anime-like. I like Japanese anime and Americanized anime. It's all in the beauty of the artwork, and yes---the angst of the characters and the storyline. Who doesn't want to see Inuyasha cream his enemies, Tsukasa struggle to remember his purpose in the World, or robots kick the shit out of each other?   3. Th lyrics are very inspiring. More on that in a minute.   The rough yet graceful textures of dark-filled emotion pop out at you. You almost need to hear the song, but once you read the lyrics, the anime video and the song form in your head. This song is cryptic to me, as are most Linkin Park songs that I can name off (and that's all of them). Breaking the Habit, to me, is the story of a person who has their troubles constantly from some habit---whatever it may be---and they knkow if they don't stop, it will tear them apart. That is to say, slowly destroy or kill them. They try to break the habit, but it gets the better of them. Finally, after much trama, they vow to break the habit tonight.   Anyway, the lyrics go like this:   "Memories consume  Like opening the wound  I'm picking me apart again  You all assume  I'm safe here in my room  Unless I try to start again   I don't want to be the one  The battles always choose  'cause inside I realize  That I'm the one confused   I don't know what's worth fighting for  Or why I have to scream  I don't know why I instigate  And say what I don't mean  I don't know how I got this way  I know it's not alright  So I'm  Breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  Tonight   Clutching my cure  I thightly lock the door  I try to catch my breath again  I hurt much more  Than any time before  I had no options left again   I don't want to be the one  The battles always choose  'cause inside I realize  That I'm the one confused   I don't know what's worth fighting for  Or why I have to scream  I don't know why I instigate  And say what I don't mean  I don't know how I got this way  I know it's not alright  So I'm  Breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  Tonight   I'll paint it on the walls  'cause I'm the one at fault  I'll never fight again  And this is how it ends   I don't know what's worth fighting for  Or why I have to scream  But now I have some clarity  To show you what I mean  I don't know how I got this way  I know it's not alright  So I'm  Breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  Tonight   After you see/hear the music video, it's no wonder why it took six long years before the band felt anything could do it justice. The video reminds me of the future---possibly the pressent---just shown as darker. Finally, after some interestingly portrayed anime angst, we see our very own Linkin Park peeps---lead vocalist Chester Bennington (I have a MAD crush on him!!); vocalist, emcee, and sampler (plus other stuff) Mike Shinoda; along with Phoenix the bassist; Rob Bourdon the percussionist; Mr. Hahn the recorder and sampler (put Mike and Mr. Hahn together and you have *KA-CHING* MUSIC BLING AND PRETTY SOUNDS); and Brad Delson the guitarist. They are anime-ed and are singing/playing the song on top of a building, it looks like. Very nice finishing touch, and then the last thing you see is that cool...um...spinning thing...you have to see it.   All in all, it was a wonderfully done video. I can't wait for their next album, and I sit here wishing I could see them on their Projekt Revolution tour. In the meantime I faithfully bang my head to each and every one of their songs in my CD player. Linkin Park is truly the hot shit.    "So Cold" by Breaking Benjamin   Believe it or not, this is the first song I have heard from Breaking Benjamin, and I've got less to say on it, but all together I loved the darkness of hte video and song and I can't help but wonder if there is something subliminal about the video/song.   Anyway, the song sounds both angry and dramatic. It looks as if the young man is carrying the "concrete block" as a punishment for something he did. It also looks like it's chained to him, so he can't get away from it, even if he tried. Older people are following him. Maybe they are family, for they looked sorrowful.   Now, to me, I couldn't quite tell what these people were; they all were dressed up in black and in a certain way. I would have guessed Amish or Jewish because mostly all of them had dark hair, but if they aren't, and you happen to be Amish or Jewish, DO NOT TAKE OFFENSE and please DO NOT ATTACK YOUR COMPUTER, BURN THINGS, VANDALIZE A BOY'S LOCKER-ROOM, ROB A VINTAGE STORE, SMASH YOUR BROTHER WITH GUITARS, OR OTHER DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIORAL ACTIVITIES. But wait...if you're Amish, then you wouldn't have electricity, which means you wouldn't have an outlet to plug stuff in, which means you wouldn't have the Internet nor a computer, which means you'd never read this! So HA!   *silence*   Ahem.   Anyway, the song has some meaning in the fact that HARD ROCK KICKS AZZ. Wanna fight?   And for some reason, I have "When I Come Around" (by Green Day) stuck in my head. Okay wutevah.   The video gives out a little creepiness with a backround melody...I'll see if I can't practice on my handy-dandy keyboard. The scenery is awesome.   So the moral of the story is,   WATCH IT.     Games    Star Fox is just one of the games in the E³ 2004 (Electronic Entertainment Expo 2004). Nintendo Power has taken an inside look at some hot new games coming out for hte GCN and GBA. They also unleashed a little powersystem called the "Nintendo DS". And---well---look 'er up for yourself. Some titles for the GCN worth looking out for include: Metroid Prime 2: Echoes; Resident Evil 4; Star Fox; Geist; StarCraft: Ghost; Advance Wars: Under Fire; Prince of Persia; Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow; Goldeneye: Rogue Agent (yes that's right, it's a Bond game only this time you are NOT MI6. I think.), and others.   I was most excited at the news of another Star Fox game, bringing Fox McCloud back into the pilot's cockpit of his beloved Arwing. Joining him once again is my favorite gung-ho, kick-ass, take-no-crap-from-nobody avian, Falco Lombardi. Unfortunately I have reason to believe that a valued crew member will die (and my predictions tend to be right...*sigh*). But they say both the storyline and multiplayer gaming are awesome. And some good space battles and inter-planetary fights are what I'm looking forward to. Only question: Is the villian once again the deposed evil emperor Andross? And are the members of the Star Wolf team still alive? Only time wil tell. The game is scheduled to release this November.   StarCraft is finally staying away from the PC and launching StarCraft: Ghost, where you are a Confederate---what else---ghost specialist. But I can't wait for some good, alien butt-kickin' fun, and it looks promising.   Lastly is the short movie clip of an upcoming Legend of Zelda game due to release sometime in 2005. It features an adult Link---and let's face it, folks: Link looks hot. The graphics are beautiful. All three games are a must for me.   Cheers!   ~Valkyrie Juno signing off~

      Seems that some neo-Nazis are coming for a rally in Lincoln tomorrow afternoon. There was a lot of press talk on it, but most of it is negative. Mayor Seng and Governor Johanns keep telling people not to go, to chase out the Nazis and show them that this is not a "state of hate". There's to be some protesting in the streets against it. I wish I could go but my parents are busy.  We're hoping that no one shows up at the rally so that the Nazis will get embarrassed after all this press attention. Ha! They'll never come back again, I hope. I believe the reason they are bothering to show up here at all is that our minority population is considerably low, both racially and religiously. Religiously, we have a few Jewish synagouges in Lincoln and Omaha, but that's about it. Racially, the percent of people that are white is like, 90 something (I can't find the stupid almanac right now.) So the Nazis figured, "Hey it's all good if we go there, since there aren't going to be hordes of diverse people around there." WRONG. We'll kick their sorry asses right out of the state. ^^  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ~Valkyrie Juno signing off~

      This is from a clip that my mom saved and gave to me, in hopes that it would help me in high school---and it has. It's an Ann Landers article, where a teacher in Mississppi needs help in explaining the difference to communism, fascism, and socialism. Ann gives us an interesting look at political science.    Socialism:  You have two cows. Give one cow to your neighbor.    Communism:  You have two cows. Give both cows to the government, and they may give you some of the milk.    Fascism:  You have two cows. You give all the milk to the government, and the government sells it.    Nazism:  You have two cows. The government shoots you and takes both cows.    Anarchism:  You have two cows. Keep both of the cows, shoot the government agent and steal another cow.    Capitalism:  You have two cows. Sell one cow and buy a bull.    Surrealism:  You have two giraffes. The government makes you take harmonica lessons.

      Okay, I know I've been stupid and put more work on myself by starting new fics before I've finished older ones, but hey---I had a lot of ideas! It wasn't my fault! I believe I'll just up and post a chapter a day at a new fanfiction blog that I'm making, while at the same time putting up one at fictionpress.net. Most of these are all fanfiction ones, but they don't have anything to do with Star Fox in some of them, it just takes place in that universe. So I consider much of it original fiction. Ha! So there!    Other random thoughts:    It's actually warm outside, now that it's July! I bet we won't get rain for a good two months, like it was last year. Damn drought.

      ---Having a turtle in my yard. ??? Whatever.  ---Getting Blink-182 cd.  ---Playing songs on my keyboard out of sheer boredom.  ---Going to see Spiderman 2   Finally, I found something interesting that Rydia told me. She says that they are considering Ralph Fiennes, among other actors, to play Voldemort. NOOOOO! THAT IS WRONG!!!!!!! Maybe they've chosen him all ready, I don't know yet. We'll soon find out. But he is not Voldemort, I tell you! He's Remus Lupin! Anyone else up for him and Mr. Thewlis to change places? I am. Voldemort is not suppost to be good looking, and Lupin is not suppost to be bad looking. *groans*

      My old eEzboard...erm...board, Aureus Vesper Prime, has been nearly dead for a long while, and my friend Christy suggested giving it some board CPR, so here it goes! I've posted everything I can think of in order to make it look busy, and hopefully I can get some traffic in there.  Meanwhile, I'm praying that *certain persons* don't come in and create a mess. You know who you are. (TL or GK or anyone else annoying...no wait, just you two.) If you do come, please be polite and not wreak past arguments and differences on the other members. Thank you.
