      Greetings, and welcome, all ye desirous of knowledge.  This Web Journal is for all those who want the real skinny on current events and the proper attitude to take towards them.  Why should you read this?  I suppose you should read it if you're confused by current events and lack knowledge of the historical context in which they appear.  This is probably most people in the world.  Current events are part of history's rich tapestry, and blah de blah de blah.  News should be approached with skepticism, and the awareness that "all news written during wartime is propaganda", as George Orwell once wrote.  WHAT'S THE SCANDAL OF THE DAY?  The scandal of the day is the matter of prisoner abuse in Iraq.  I saw a photo today of a detainee with shit smeared all over him.  That must have been a bummer.  Tons more photos to come, no doubt.  Plenty of stories from detainees about the humiliation they underwent.    The Skinny:  This prison was f'ed up.  Saddam's regime built that building and used it for torture.  No way we Americans should've been using it, we shoulda just torn the whole thing down at the get-go.  Our soldiers in charge of that prison were really f'ed up, too.  I think the torture was part boredom, and part "vengeance"; probably vengeance for having to work such a shitty job out in the middle of the desert.  Smear shit all over a prisoner?  Sure, why not.  Relieves the mindless tedium of this boring place.    That's no excuse for the soldiers' behavior, of course.  Boredom does not excuse sadism.  The people in charge of that prison should've done better.  Prison terms for them all.  THE PROPER ATTITUDE  Is one of remorse, and questioning.  Firstly, when the newspapers ran the allegations of the prison detainees, might they should have also shown us the crimes of which these prisoners were accused?  Whatever these detainees were accused of, it doesn't merit torture under American imprisonment, but I thought it would have been interesting to have seen how many of those guys were accused of murder.  Secondly, I can't speak for everyone, but I'd rather have shit smeared all over me than be decapitated, you know what I mean?  I'd rather have a glowstick shoved up my ass and then later complain about it to the newspapers and get a cash settlement from the American government than be decapitated, you know what I mean?  Would you rather be naked and pretend to jerk off in front of a female guard, or would you rather be put into a plastic shredder?  I won't deny that there's blood on our hands in Iraq. I've seen the photos of the burned and maimed children.  Does the good we do over there mitigate the bad?    It's just with today's military capacity, America is way too strong for any country to fight against as an army, toe-to-toe.  And so, rather than put military bases, soldiers, and armaments in places that are as far away from cities and children, our enemies instead take the opposite tack and put these things right next to cities and children, so that America will "look bad" when these things are destroyed as collateral damage is done.  Collateral damage:  "unintentional damage or incidental damage affecting facilities, equipment or personnel occurring as a result of military actions directed against targeted enemy forces or facilities."  The key word here is "unintentional".  It doesn't help our side when we do collateral damage. "Such damage can occur to friendly, neutral, and even enemy forces."
