      In honor of the passing trade deadline, I've compiled this list on how to make it as a GM in any professional sports league.   1.  Show complete disregard for team chemistry. It's completely overrated. The Marlins that upset the Yankees in Yankee Stadium to win the World Series was just an anamoly. Also, disregard the fact that Detroit Pistons beat the heavily favored Lakers. You can help yourself out by trading any team captains or leaders like the Dodgers just did when they got rid of Lo Duca.   2.   Trade away one of the best players on your team for younger talent. Every GM does this. This way, you can suck not only now, but you can also suck later. Consistency! That's how you keep your job. Example? None other than the GM of the Los Angeles Clippers, Elgin Baylor.   3.   If it ain't broke, fix it anyway. This would be like adding an outfielder to a team with way too many outfielders in the first place. The Dodgers just did this when they acquired Steve Finley from the Diamondbacks, which were exercising rule number two.   4.   Alienate yourself from your fans. Yet another common practice in all major sports leagues. I don't have any good examples, but trust me. Do this, and you shall succeed.   5.  Put yourself in salary cap hell early in your term. This is a great idea that will increase your job security immensely. How, you ask? If you aren't getting anything done, you can complain about the cap keeping you from signing people. This doesn't work for baseball right now, see rule number six.   6.  Try to get hired by a small market teams. This works especially for baseball. If you suck in a small market, you can blame it on you money-grubbing owner. Then you force him to give you money so that you can observe rule number seven.   7.  Sign free agents in the offseason to deals that would otherwise seem ridiculous. Beating out your competition was never so much fun! Three points and three rebounds off the bench last year? Sounds like a forty million dollar player to me!   8.  In the unlikely event that you do get fired, blame it on anyone but yourself. This is the most used technique in all of jobs. If you play the blame game enough, some one just might hire you for their team.  There you have it.  Follow those rules and money will meet your hands as a major sports GM.

       This is a day late, but anyone who watched the Cardinals-Cubs game should be pissed off at Cubs All-Star pitcher, Carlos Zambrano.  What he did the other night was not only childish, but definitely warrants a suspension of some kind.    For those who did not see the game, I'll give you the info.  Zambrano is a pitcher who gets real lively when he pitches, kind of like Jose Lima from the 2004 World Series Champion Los Angeles Dodgers (Hottest team in baseball!).  Anyway, Carlos was a little wild to start the game and allowed two Cardinals to get on base.  The Cardinals' star outfielder, Jim Edmonds, came up to the plate and took the first pitch right on the back of the hip.  It could have been an accident, but it sure as hell didn't look like it.  Later in the game, Edmonds is up to the plate again. He belts a two-run homer out of the stadium, he pauses a second to watch it fly.  As he rounds the bases, Carlos is absolutely screaming at him.  In the sixth, Carlos strikes out Jim, and actually  wags his finger  at Edmonds.  Who does this guy think he is?  He has a strikeout, and Edmonds has a walk and a home run with two RBIs.  Lastly, Edmonds got beaned in the hip again by Zambrano, who susequently got tossed.     How is this going to get handled by the league office?  It was an obvious beaning the second time.  You can make a case for the first one, but albeit not a strong one.  I know baseball is a bit lenient with penalties, but you can't have a pitcher going absolutely nutso on the mound.  It would be fine with me if Dusty Baker took care of it in-house.  Either way, someone really needs to take this guy out for at least a start.    Until Later Posts,    Clay Trainum

      The ever ratings-hungry Fox Network needs to do a celebrity boxing deal soon.  I don't care what matches they do, just as long as they pit  Apprentice  creator and real estate mogul, Donald Trump against  Benefactor  creator and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban.  It needs to happen, God knows I'd watch.    The Donald could be in there with flames on his shorts (If you don't get it, it'll hit you square in the face later).  I'm not sure how he'd approach boxing, but I expect his hair would have something to do with it.  Maybe a distraction?  I can see him baiting boxers and punching them in the face.  If he knocked out a dude, he could take an Ali-esque pose over the opponents limp body and yell, "You're FIRED!"    Cubes would be a different kind of fighter.  First, he'd take you to dinner (and he'd pay because he's rich).  Then he'd talk to you and crack jokes.  He wouldn't actually box an opponent, but you can bet your money that the referee for the match better watch his back.  He'd then get knocked out, but he'd take you out to dinner again and crack jokes about himself on national television.    So, I now turn to Fox.  Pit these guys against each other.  It'd be awesome.  I don't care if its before or after the Shawn Bradley versus Pavel Podkolzine fight, but it  NEEDS  to happen.  The winner could be crowned "Best Richest Sports Geek Ever."

      I grew up not watching football. Hell, I hated it up until about four or five years ago. So when I started to follow the Titans, Eddie George and Steve McNair became my two favorite football players in the NFL. Naturally, after seeing my Lakers torn up in the past two weeks (Derek Fisher on the Warriors? UGH!), the last thing I wanna see is Eddie George leave.   I live in southern Indiana. There are only three types of fans here. There are lots of the dreaded Colts fans (who tripled in number with "lifelong fans" here last year), Titans fans, and then a few Packers fans peppered in. Anyway, I went against the grain in following the Titans a few years back. I bragged about Eddie, about McNair, about the  Music City Miracle , about getting to the Super Bowl (ONE YARD, ONLY ONE DAMN YARD!!!) to these Colts fans. I don't wanna see the face of the franchise that I've come to love leave.   I can sympathize with Eddie though. He's gotten so used to being the goto guy down in Nashville that he may of become uncomfortable with big "Air" McNair gunslinging like his last name was Earp. I also understand that the Titans want him to take around a three million dollar pay cut, and Eddie don't like that. I also understand that Eddie was being relegated to less carries due to the ovious potential in Chris Brown. I understand all that, Eddie has more than good reason to leave the Titans.   Well, I have a few things to say to Eddie. Buck the system. Take the pay cut, don't you wanna hear that usual sell out crowd in the Coliseum chant "Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!" for just a few more years. I mean, you have lots of money. Stick around a little while longer. Why don't you see if Tyrone Calico could do what Kevin Dyson couldn't in that Super Bowl awhile back. Just stick around a bit longer, and you won't be sorry.   Until Later Posts,   Clay Trainum

      Anybody watch that excuse of a show they put on for SportsCenter last night? Why didn't they just suck it up and rename it ShaqCenter for the night. I mean the pports day can't be slow, can it? I think there were a total of five stories not having to do with Shaq or the Lakers last night. I understand covering one of the biggest trades in NBA history, but that's a bit too much coverage.    Anyway, Kobe is now officially a Laker again. Honestly, was there actually any doubt? I mean the differences were a whole lot more than just money and talent. If the Lakers need a guy in order to get past a wall, most of the time they get it. The Clippers may add that piece, but they'll get rid of everyone else. I think Kobe was using the Clippers as more of a bargaining piece than anything else. You know, just to make sure a couple things got done back in El Segundo.    So now this whole mess involving the trades and such is pretty much done, the Laker roster is starting to shape up. I'll tell you what, they won't be as good as last year, but  athletically  this team is stellar. They still need a center, but that is attainable. Remember the change in Erick Dampier last season? He averaged twelve points and twelve boards last season for the worst team in the state of California, the Golden State Warriors. He would be a helluva pick-up for the Purple and Gold, but he'll be incredibly overpriced (especially after fellow Warrior, Adonal Foyle, got the big payday a while back). Either way, he's the best center available right now, and you have to go after him.    I also wouldn't be surprised if LA made some sort of deal to try to get Nene from Denver. At first sound, it seems highly unlikely. Think about it though. Denver just got Kenyon Martin (highway robbery for him too, or well, turnpike robbery) from the Nets. They also re-signed Marcus Camby, which will relegate "Baby" to the bench. Also, look at the depth of the Lakers now. You're telling me they couldn't try to entice that from Denver?    In the end, I think Odom could be a great sidekick to the Kob-ster. Batman's Robin, Jordan's Pippen, Tiger's weird talking club cover. Odom could really be a great player if he keeps himself healthy and out of trouble. I also think Caron Butler is a stud. He was the most overlooked rookie two years ago. Last year, he dealt with injuries and the shine of fellow overlooked rookie (regular season-wise at least) Dwyane Wade. He may be a bench guy now, but he is no slouch whatsoever.    I don't think that this team is as bad as everyone is saying they are. This team can go places if they can stay healthy and have some resemblence of chemistry. But, I am a Laker fan, and one definitely needs to have some optimism after losing the most dominating force ever to play in the League.    Until Later Posts,    Clay Trainum

      I'm pretty bored at the moment, so I decided to do something I've been meaning to do for a while, publish a blog. I know, I know the fad has been around for quite a while now. I figure who better to bring up the caboose than the Trainwreck? (Ed. Note: You like that? Off the top of my head too. What can I say? Genius, pure genius...) Anyway, I'll probably start posting my useless, boring, slanted sports views on here in the coming days. See you guys around, I guess.
