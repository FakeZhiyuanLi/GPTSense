        This was the biggest audition turnout production has seen to date, there was about 12k people here to audition. There is just SOOOOOO much to see here in DC like the White House, Museum of American History, Capitol Building, Washington Monument, and to tell you the truth I couldn't care less. All this history and educational stuff makes me sick to my balls. However we did go to a bar last night that had 300 different beers.  And YES, "I am the problem with America."

        I had a chance to talk to Phil this morning, and it was nothing short of amazing:  BUCKLE: "Soooo ahhh...I guess that hurricane is gonna hit you guys today huh? Did you put the hurricane shudders up?  PHIL: "Nah, not this time."  BUCKLE: "So like masking tape then?"  PHIL: "Nope we're just gonna wait this one out."  STRAIGHT GANGSTA! I mean seriously, it sounded as if he was waiting for the bitch on the front lawn in a plastic pool chair. The tone of his voice was like, "well if it ain't 150mph then stop wasting my time, bring it you fuck." Honestly people... sometimes when I stare directly into his beautiful face, my eyes burn. It's like looking into the fucking sun.

      I know I said that Middle America is a "disgusting mess," but I had the chance to go to a few different bars and I found a few good looking girls. However, to me California is like a western conference all-star team. Hot chicks in St. Louis are like good players on a shitty expansion team with low attendance, and in the end they all want to be drafted. Anywho we got back in today and we'll be leaving again the beginning of next week for D.C.   On a side note: Year after year contestants for AI are "unique", "talented", & "NO ONE has heard anyone like THEM!" However the tide has changed and now this year "The Lord is on my side," HEY...well guess what, apparently the Lord can only pick one of you douche bags so tough shit.

      The hotel in Cleveland was a total pile, so the view at this one definitely makes up for it...it's pretty ricockulous, that's right Busch Stadium. We also went to one of the river boat casinos on the Mississippi and won a little. Yeah...I'm sure you can imagine what kind of people we saw at a "river boat casino."   The girl contestants are definitely getting better looking, but overall Middle America is a fucking disgusting mess.

      Even though this is the first audition city, I'm already sick of shitty kids singing all day. It's like an annoying girl you haven't seen in a long time...at first you're like man I can't wait to see her, I miss her so much. Then BOOM! Fuck man, this is why I haven't talked to her in so long. Anyway were heading in about an hour to St. Louis and I think the flight is only like an hour, hopefully we'll have some good BBQ or get stabbed while were there.

      ...seriously the Browns are horrible. The locker room looked better than the team did last year.   Another day, another dollar.

      I'm actually heading out tomorrow morning to catch a flight for the first leg of the American Idol 4 auditions. We start off in Cleveland, then go to St. Louis. The following weeks and months we'll be in D.C., Vegas, San Fran, New Orleans, Orlando, and Anchorage. I'll be audio posting and writing throughout so make sure to checking in.
