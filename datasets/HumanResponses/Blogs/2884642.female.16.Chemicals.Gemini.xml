      I'm so stoked, I went skating tonight and learned a how to grind finally. I actually did a boardslide too, but then i ate it really really hard but its all good it was def worth it. Work was work today and there were alot of people, and then when we were trying to close and people tried to sneak in and stuff and got Rico really mad. haha, and then we didn't get out of there till 7, and that wasn't fun at all. But then i skated with Whittikans and Adam and i had such a blast with those 2, there hilarious. I wish i had a car!

      Omg i swear, Coach Jessie Tyler of the Olympic HEights Swim team talks out of his ass! This whole night was a waste of my freakin time, geez. He was saying oh out of all the years i've been coaching you have been the best team and the coolest people and you've helped me soo much. HELPED YOU!!!!! what are you talking about??? I did EVERYTHING, you can ask everyone, did you order the suits? no did you call everyone all the time? No, Did you ever care about anything i said? NO. Seriously I have so much more responsibility than this man. Thanks for being such a great group? My butt. We have the worst reputation in the world, our whole swim team drinks and smokes pot. You moron.  Plus i'm sorry but the retard of the team was there and for some reason he and dad are like best friends? what the h e double hockey sticks is that about? Plus his dad came drunk to the banquet, what is that, drinking straight whiskey at a banquet..learn your place parents. What is it these days? Can it be that some kids are becoming more responsible than adults and parents? What is this?

      Oh man I made out like a bandit today, i feel like a new not a girl but almost a woman. Shiz today was slow then fast then slow and then fast again. I got to see Maria today which was awesome, and had a fantabulous lunch and saw my sister and Simone, and Michelle? i think. Then after that i got off at 5 and didn't have to be back till like 630 so i skated to the Cove and looked at the boats and this new restaurant, dun remember what its called but i swear they only sell like chicken and lamb, i guess thats all you need these days, then i skated down to Publix shopping center and skated around looking at stuff, and went to the 99 cent and up store and got this hot Jamaican set of 2 sweat bands and a sweat head thing. Then I jetted over to Starbucks and hooked myself up with a Venti chocolate brownie frap. Then i skated, back on hillsboro to the bridge and stood on the bridge looking at boats for awhile and proceeded down the beach and skated down that sidewalk, and got yelled at by some old guy "Hey! there's no skateboarding here" and while i skated passed him i took a long sip of my Starbucks and kinda slowed down, it was great. Then i went back to island, and got hooked up! I got a pair of Rhombuses? sp? Which are absolutely sick, and then i got some other sweat bands and stuff and picked some stuff up fo you know who. and Tijers. Absolutely fantabulous. Hey I'm stoked, you should be to

      So my Friday ended up not being too bad after all, actually it was a blast. I went to Ramp with Dre, and lots of people i knew where there, Whittikans (awesome darkslide he landed by the way), Tex and his bro, Gustavo and his bro, Picinich, Ben gore, and some other kids that i didn't really know. Haha I fell this one time and got caught on the fence and my legs were over my head, and it wasn't very easy to get up, plus it hurt like a mofo, but i'm sure if i was looking at myself i would have been on the floor laughing. Dre and Whit also decided to attack eachother and then me and dre went at the same time like idiots and somehow he ended up on my skateboard with his skates on. After that we went to "THE WALK" haha and got some starbucks and he got to skate the little 2 stair, and my board was locked in the car so i couldn't get it out. And then this complete MORON parked in one of the parking spaces and ran over my purse and it was stuck under the wheel. Idiot, so then i we got these 2 "big" guys to start pushing the car back and forth so i could get it out from underneath the wheel. It was quite interesting, but fun, i swear if that girl ran over my phone i would have hit her with my skateboard. Geez. Oh and dre mabye you should take up ice skating cause it would look more manly than what your doing now. HAHAHa

      Man, I feel like such a piece of crap, despite the awesome wetsuit my sister got me, but dad is just a I don't even know. I get out of my niceee warm bed and get on my shoes and all that to just run into the store to get stuff just for him. Oh we forgot something, let me RUN through the store to get the thing he needs as fast as can, so i can get back to the checkout counter. Ok thanks for not waiting for me to run back, oh and then you got the wrong thing and he waits for me to buy it till he tells me, oh and now i'm going to walk out of the store without you and proceed to slam doors. Yeah, great night, i'm in a wonderful mood. Lyrics of the day.  Hey love, where you going to? You're not sleeping anymore, you're just trying to. Stay love, where you running to? Awful happens all the time, don't let it kill you.  Easily with me i feel as fast as I can see... Afraid of the horror stories I fall on my knees.  Jason Mraz-Hey Love

      I've just been looking through some pictures and things, and I thought i could defy the Blogger and post pictures and I had it all planned, and then the site defied me. So i suppose I will just put the site of my pictures. http://maryo.mypicgallery.com/  There it is, it has a couple of swimming pics, and 2 of my most recent watercolors I did. I think I will just mess with the HTML and see what cool things I might be able to tweak with my renowned knowledge of HTML. Off to lacrosse practice.

      Well I have guessed that I am going to try this blogging thing, now I suppose that the Livejournal is a kid's thing and the "Blogging" thing is the adult thing to do now a days. So now i'm going to try to be like my prodigious sister. Watch out, yes, i am using big words. I found it quite funny, that after i choose my background I looked at Shannon's "blog" and found out that we chose the same background. What can i say we both have impeccable taste. Well my 15th Valentine's Day has passed and what can I say? Absolutely nothing, it was another one spent listening to everyone's fun stories of how they actually have a life and go out places. And me? I offer to work Erica's shift of 1 to close, to merely pass the time, of my going nowhere. But I suppose that's how life flows. Oh, and not to mention, i got nothing in my box, no candy like everyone else, as Tj would say that's bufalay, atleast Shannon and Tj care, and bring me presents and visit me. Yesterday was fun atleast, I went to Karlie's house and watched "Cabin Fever", which i must say is THE worst movie I have ever seen in my 15 1/2 of life, it was absolutely disguisting, and just, words can not describe how gnar gnar it was, just don't ever see it. After the movie I was helping her with skating and getting the satisfaction of passing some of my knowledge along to a girl that would actually care about skateboarding. And to Shannon-God speed my friend to the wonderful city of Cocoa Cocoa.

       As some of you know it is the day of Mary's Liberation. My parents are out of the country and i'm left to fend for myself in this dirty world. Heck i'm the happiest person in the world right now. Last night i took the rents car to my friends house and we watched a movie till like 11. The movie was really an eye opener to me its called "thirteen" and it is a really good movie, its about a typical everyday girl who is in middle school, it shows how she tries to fit in with this one girl and ends up doing so. She ends up fitting in so well that she starts doing drugs, stealing, sneaking out whenever to go have sex with a guy she met like 2 days before, and starts being the brattiest kid ever to her mom and can't understand why her mom won't leave her alone. The movie shows how families can be torn apart and how families can be put somewhat back together and everything in that movie is a true story. After the movie i went to Eckerds(?) and picked up some starbucks and that was about the end of my escapade. I'm going to Shannon's today, so yeah..later

      So today was pretty fun i guess, i didn't do too much though. I went to work and we all just insulted eachother all day it was funny, after work i was going to go skate, but ended up not going so I went to coldstones with Karlie and heard all about Italy and everything. Then we went to Albertsons and had some fun with "the balls" goodtimes. I saw the funniest shirt ever, there is this Jewish store in the shopping center (only in freakin Boca) and it had the superman sign on the shirt with this omish hat with 2 strings of curly hair hanging down and said "SuperJew" beneath it. I soo wish i had my camera with me omg. funniest thing I have ever seen. We had a good talk about stupid guys that give us mixed signals and girls that screwed us over and have a problem with lying. Good to get these things out of your system. Mary's Liberation in 2 days! later

       You know a lot of people give me a bunch of crap about riding the bus places, i have no idea why. Yes the bus is kinda grundgy and stuff, but you know what? I always someway have a good experience on the bus. There is so much diversity and i'm always meeting these really weird people. Today for instance i met a brazillian lady who was complaining about the bus driver cause he was stupid and didn't drop her off at Logger's Run plaza, and she was saying how her accent wasn't bad and she was still understandable. Then she was telling me a bunch of stories of fat black women that hated her and asked her if she was a mom. This made her angry and she said she didn't look that old haha. Then we had a discussion about how all the girls in Boca are fat and why that was and that she was happy I wasn't fat like all the other girls. This lady made my day. One time when i was on the bus I got into a conversation with a black man that worked at Win-Dixie, he told me about how working at Win-Dixie doesn't pay anything and that he was really poor and it wasn't an easy life, but he loved his job and helping all the people with the groceries. This always brings my brain back into my head and I really remember that you don't have to make lots of money to be happy. I need to put things back into perspective, and remember what I live for. So next time you feel bored or something, hop on the bus and meet some people that can make a world of difference and put your life back into perspective.

      Today was quite exciting, i went to coral springs and met up with dre. From there we did so much skating, I also got to go to BC for the first time and they have some rad clothes. I want the D&G shirt Som Ting Wong? crakin up. After that we skated out back with the 2 stair and i just ollied over a concrete block and some stuff like that. From there we went to red rail, and bank of murrca where i ran into a sign, yes i ran into a sign. Then we went to dre's school hoping to skate the loading dock, but someone was in the school and we didn't want to get into some crap with them. After that Dre got stuck on like 5 rocks and went flying. Then we went to Denny's with me hoping to get high on some chocolate cake but they dumb guy wouldnt serve us. This stupid pris came up to me and was like can you teach me to skate and i was like uh..and then she stepped on my board and almost ate it. Work tomorrow, party at Shannon's only 2 people allowed in the house at a time, then who knows from there. I Plead the FIF-Cinco. Hahaha

      What a great Sunday, the skating was absolutely amazing. Soo many people were there this year, Chad Bartie, TNT, Mike V., Rick McKrank, Bastien Salabanzi, some japanese kid Kyogi oaidjlaldj, who was only 16 and tore the place apart. The bus ride was absolutely hilarious, the ride back was the best though. Imagine sitting there in the dark and listening to Robby Picinich, say weird things like Pink blaaa, and then hearing some kid step on Nukem, cause he was sleeping on the floor, and then the sound of some kid beating on the bathroom door cause he got locked in. Needless to say, it was rockin. Can't wait till i fin. the cam. roll. Can you say WHAT!?

And of course i stood around and just laughed all night, at Wes and Nukem, there sooo funny; Scumbag signing, hey Ben Gore, Grow up and stop being a pussy!! And then this black kid asked for Rachel Dijons number and autograph and she wrote down some fake number haha. Then i did my usual Miles stalking, and hung around, and i got to be a bouncer and yell at the psyco moms trying to get there kids in, we were like get away!

      This whole world is a cold, cruel place. And my life has run out of luck. I try, i really do try to be happy, and not to call people names in my head and just try to be optimistic, like i used to be. My battle has ended and my enemy, shot and shot, and then threw the atomic bomb, and killed my army. The army has gone too far, and blown away the barriers. Who knew at fifteen i would still be trying to hold back tears, and not drop those tears in front of my superiors, who have come to tell me that my army has lost the war.

      What a horrible day. This day was just full of nasty kids and mean people on the phone. I don't get why people think they can be so rude. If a guy tells me one more time that i need to update the surf report and its my problem, i'm going to tell him to come in the store, and then i'm going to punch him in the face. Also to mention, that i found out that i might not be going to Tampa Pro for certain reasons, but i really think its a certain someone as usual. At least i put a really cool pair of shoes on hold today...

      I've been doing a crapload of school lately, and I had to do this biography paper and pick an author to do it on. Now if you know me i HATE reading, its so boring to me, so i was like great another stupid paper. So i randomly picked and author and decided to pick Robert Louis Stevenson. So i did the whole biography thing, but it was supposed to be more on what influenced him to write the book i was going to read after the report. So I wanted to read Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde but the library ended up not having it. What the heck?!  So i picked Kidnapped. And let me tell you i am reading it right now, and I love this book, it is so good. I definitely recommend reading his works, or even the biography on him, another thing that makes his books interesting is that he puts the Scottish language into also. So if you want, here is my report i wrote            urlLink Robert Louis Stevenson

      Soo lacrosse is over and I'm stoked cause the season of surfing and skating is here. I was hoping for it to start yesterday, but apparently God doesn't want me to use my new longboard yet, and it is very frustrating.  I went skating Friday with Dre in the good ole' Coral Springs and I am very excited cause I am actually improving, I have my kickflips down i just need to get the front foot on now, and I was ollieing up curbs i did about five in a row with out messing up, all thanks to the lucky golf ball. I was going to go surf yesterday, but of course no waves to be found, plus i forgot to call the momakins when i got off the bus, so about 3 hours later i got a threatening message on the phone and about 5 missed calls from her...yikes..so i got grounded this weekend, no hanging out, no skating.  no kill bill with Shaunna and a nice quiet ride home. Today, i finally worked a full day, it was ridiculously slow for awhile but eventually picked up, the skate team was there this morning and Robby walked by me, and as he did, he did his famous Pink Blachh for me haha. . Besides that i have stupid SATs tomorrow and Wednesday and all i'm doing is praying for some waves!

How do some people feel about you: She believes in higher energy and better things for all the people/She is a charm of good luck when she's sitting by your side   How do you feel about yourself: Aspects of life they confuse me/I'm feeling happy finally./ I've no room for sorrow and I feel lit inside./It's something I cannot hide.

      And we laugh till we cry  Always so hard to say goodbye (good bye)  And we all sit round here in our home town  It's so good like this, these are times we'll miss  The memories, I hope they'll never fade Glowing embers lie across the sky   I would stop time to stay with you  I would stop time so we don't move  I would stop time  I would stop time  I would stop time to keep you    Ahh, parents coming home tomorrow, so not excited..eh..

      Sometimes I wish you could just give the parents money and say go away..I haven't been this happy in awhile, and its not just cause of the parents being gone.   And the seasons keep changing / tides still come in / whether living or dying, there is world without end / whether in happiness or sorrow, I will say everything's fine / and if there's one thing for sure, this is no standard life

       So i have decided that as you get older the more parents hate you, or atleast thats the way it is in this family. Try going to dinner and plan on having a nice dinner, but when you get to dessert imagine your mom and dad making fun of you and your eating habits and telling you that you are going to gain lots of weight and be fat and that you stuff your face not only to you but to you in a restaurant. I'm sorry i don't feel like playing 4 sports at the same time, and that i like to have a break once a year and be a normal kid. I'm sorry you hate my skating and surfing and skimming and don't think that i can stay fit by doing that. I'm sorry i have a job and try to work hard and be productive and learn the trade. I'm sorry i can never be good enough for this family and to you i do everything wrong. God what am i thinking i don't do drugs, i don't go out every night and destroy things, i don't have sex with every boy i know. What the heck was i thinking, i have a job, i stay locked up in the house all day, i love skateboarding, i'm such a horrible kid. Thanks for making fun of me and my weight, this doesn't put a damper on my self-esteem.

        I can't stand this anymore, i hate it, I want to leave so bad and I can't. All i do is fight fight fight and then i get yelled at for speaking the truth back, i got into 3 fights in one day that must be some kind of record. First off he looks through my folder that was on his computer and listens to every single freaking song and then tells me i need to watch what i listen to and gives me some shitty speach about how guys are going to think i'm cheap if they hear me listening to whatever i listen to. F that, have you heard the crap you listen to, mabye you should go back and listen to the actual lyrics, cause back in the day of his music all they sang about was sex and drugs, SEX, DRUGS, AND ROCK N ROLL isn't that how the saying goes? Obviously i'm not going to be with a guy who thinks i'm cheap and easy, i'm not an F-ing idiot, i don't even have a guy, so why am I getting this speech? Then i get bitched at because i told him i want a password on MY computer yes MINE; oh no you can't do that cause what if i have to work on your computer; i tell him i don't want you working on my computer when i'm gone, cause i don't want you going through the stuff in my room next or messing up my computer like yours,i definitely got yelled at for that, oh and then i need to update whatever crap on my computer fine whatever i'll do it well blah blah blah; he tells me to close the program, so i did i hit the X, I told you to close the program not shut it down! I meant shrink it don't you know how to do anything? If you don't listen i'm just going to take your computer away. GODDDD, i'm so stressed right now, i can't take it AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

      The Scumbag premeir rocked, i thought that people would show up, but it ended up that just about every kid in Deerfield Beach showed up, it was an awesome turnout. The movie was amazing, the music in the movie was amazing, the skating in the movie was awesome, Eric Carter is awesome, Scumbags are awesome. After the premeir we went out to celebrate at this burger place, and i had a turkey burger which was awesome, this girl i met, Ashley got an ostrich burger haha and Corey Lindholm had to top everyone off and get the 1 pound burger it was gnarly haha. Today i did my second day of skimming, and it was very successful i must say, yesterday was just gnar gnar, i really just beat myself up, it was one of those days where it kept flying back and hitting my ankle, and it cut my toe yeah not fun. oh well

      Gosh the most horrible thing happened yesterday, i was coming home from the island meeting last night and I got a call from my friend Dre. He told me the news that my friend Irina's dad had died that morning from a stroke. I've known Irina for about 2 years now, and i've only met her dad about 2 times, but the times that i got to meet him and spend sometime with him, was always fun. He was a great man and it broke my heart to hear what had happened. I suppose the memorial is sometime this week coming up, so i'm not sure when all that jazz is happening, but besides that it seems like my week hasn't been going to great, things are changing again i guess. Everyone i've talked to is having a bad week, my uncle went to the doctor and found out he has a syst on his kidney and has to get surgery for a hernia; today dad got mad at me for i don't even know, plus he was in a bad mood so he was throwing my stuff around and then threw my camera case at my head and was yelling, gosh i wanted to leave so bad, i just locked myself in the bathroom for awhile i felt like i just wanted to cry for hours or punch a hole in the wall or something. I went surfing yesterday and the waves were just waist high dump, i was to the right of some guy kinda of behind him but to the side and i was just duck diving and he just let go of his board so of course it was like a 7'2" and it just full on hit me in the head, then i came up to breathe after it hit me and it hit me again in the head. I also saved a turtle that was in the road today and some high school jerks drove by and started yelling and whistling at me, and they were calling me a bitch and some other things i couldn't hear.  I just want to leave this world.

      Well today sucked, well most of the time. I got written up today for pretty much no reason. I switched with Cassie for her hours today, and i came in yesterday to the shop and asked her if she asked someone to switch, and she said she did and she got it all taken care of, so supposedly the person she talked to didn't remember to switch it. So i got a talk from mark, and it basically all fell on me, so i was stoked. Ricco let me leave 30 min early so i could surf, so i did, and i thought it was pretty small so i took "Herburt" the Hobie out and got beat up by him, i got whacked in the lip twice and got a nice stake in the back. So after that i just said "over it" and went back to the shop and got my shortboard, and then i had more fun on that. Then the waves jacked up and got gnarly, and then one wave just ended the fun for me. So i went in, and i was happy with my performance. Oh yes and then when i got in my car to go home my phone broke, yeah just doesn't want to work anymore, i went to look at my message and it said screw you mary, stupid cell phones, who came up with the piece of crap anyway.

      Gosh I am so bored. No one to hang out with, nothin to do.  My highlights have been taking the Pimp Tran to deerfield and stocking sandals with Whit. I need the party machine linsey back. Eh, well i went surfing today with Marcos on the little teeny tiny waves, and yes they were ridable cause i was cross walking my Hobie "Herburt".  For some strange reason dad bought me a new memory card for my camera, but since my camera is huge and old, it will only hold 8Mb not 32Mb, stupid. I also walked out of work today, to go home, and i sat in the car, and there was dad, sitting in the car jamming to Beastie Boys. ??? What?! My dad is listening to BB? Soo weird. Worked stock, tried on everything possible. I want to go upcoast or something, i have nothing else to do, no new places to go, i work, i surf, i skate...same ol' same ol' Van Helsing this Saturday though..yeah...

       So my first day of driving was not bad at all i must say, way to much to write for my day so i will not bore you. If the scanner worked with Windows XP I would put up my lovely license, but due to technical difficulties i will not be able to do so. I went surfing again today, i think that it is the 4th day i've surfed since surf camp, enjoying it while i can, there is supposed to be waves tomorrow. Inventory again tomorrow, not looking forward to it. And that is the end of my story.

       I've just turned 16 just a week ago and I already feel like God is challenging me. I'm not sure what he is challenging me for, but i don't know a lot of things have been going on within friends. One of my sorta friends, (the friend you talk to but you don't really hang out with) does drugs and he is very pessimistic, and that makes me so angry i hate it when people are so negative; but he recently messed up his ankle and its just now starting to get better but he still can't skate very well, i told him he should enter the contest coming up but he was saying how he couldn't do anything and he lost all his tricks and he's going to smoke before his run so he doesn't feel pain and all this; and it just made me so mad that he was saying that, that i told him to stop being to pessimistic and that smoking was gross and if he would just start being positive and relax, he could still have fun with his friends and have fun skating even if he couldn't skate very well; and that smoking wasn't the way to go and that he should quit completely. He actually took this talk very well and said that he'll do the contest and try to have fun. This really suprised me. Things are going well with the parents too, no big blow-outs lately; and the lady next door that i'm pretty good friends with said that she would try to get me a job with her company, and said that when she gets her new convertible she wants me to drive it cause shes so stoked that i'm getting my license. Awesomeness

       What do you think of when you think of surf camp? Fun, surf, sunglasses, sand, water, jellyfish mabye? Well this is what happens when Mary O goes to surf camp.   That is bright red burned skin, with bright purple surrounding it, sun cancer mabye? This will be just like last year a nice scabbing and then a peel; how absolutely disgusting, this happend last year and now it happens again, and yes i did use sunscreen.

      Yes, so now i am 16 years old, and yes i don't really feel different except for the parents freaking out part about me driving and my mom acting like i've never driven on the road before. My license is 9 days away and its taking forever. I'm already tired of being home, and i would like to wake up, throw on my bathing suit, walk out the door onto the beach, and surf all day again. Although i must say that the best part about my birthday was going to Taco City for dinner, and taking 16 of my friends with me, i must say that now i think i know what it feels like to be a celebrity and walk into a place with a whole horde of people following me and talking to me at the same time and cracking jokes about me with everyone, and then having Scotty get everyone to sing happy birthday to me about 5 times, just so he can see my face get cherry red again, then have some Norweigen lady come up and tell me happy birthday and give me 20 bucks, and then having Tanner be my "date" for my birthday cause Roman said that i should have a date for my 16th birthday. I must say it was great, the birthday, the conversations with my friends, the surf, the trips, the dancing; it was a great week to get away and have new surroundings. Now i just can't wait till it comes back, atleast i hope it does, really really really soon.

I had hoped for something  Defeat?  No. Something more.   THere isn't anything more. Except victory. It may be worse.  I hoped for a long time for victory.  Now I don't know   It has to be one or the other  I don't believe in victory anymore  I don't but I don' believe in defeat, though it may be bettter  What do you believe in?"

All she wants is a place to skate and a place to store her skate stuff and/or skate "ramp" thats one ramp not 2 or more. She would prefer the Deerfield/Lighthouse Point area and/or New Smyrna Beach area, she would like to go to California also (yeah i totally just wrote Orlando instead of cali, that was bad; good thing i caught myself).

        your song is "Who Needs Shelter"    urlLink   Which Jason Mraz song are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Ha, well the Mraz concert was awesome; I was just awed that i was 6 rows back from my love. He was absolutely amazing, his voice is even more beautiful live. I definitely enjoyed myself, and laughing at Jason's ridiculousness which seemed like no one really got. The only drawbacks where what Scott and I discussed in the car priar to the concert of the 2094808 16 year old girls and yeah, they were def. there being their gay selves and ruining the concert for others, but whatever i am just so happy that i got to see Jason and be so close. I just hope that sometime I can see one of his concerts in a smaller setting, like in some of his live songs; which brings me to my next point of happiness; the real Mraz fans like myself; or mabye the infatuated ones like myself have gone on the internet and downloaded every possible live song that i could find, which are still not released; and i had the enjoyment of singing along to those songs such as "right kind of phrase" and have no one else singing along and clapping and screaming for no reason; as when he sang his popular songs like "The Remedy" and "You and I". I think one of the best parts of the night was the last song "Curbside Prophet" but singing it with Raul Midon, DJ Necksnapp, Makana, and the girl; it was funny and great to listen to, to say the least "word". haha.

       So this morning started by waking up around 7 am and being so cold that i was shaking for almost an hour. I caught some kind of 24 hour bug i guess, but Dre called me and talked to me to keep me company and so i wouldn't be bored, and then i talked to Shannon for awhile and then Napolean Dynamite called me, I felt so special. I watched this show on the Travel Channel all about donuts and who in the USA has the best donuts, this one guy makes them in Hawaii and they are big round donuts covered in sugar....i now want a donut really really bad.

       (deep sigh) Dear Lord, Well the past 3 days have been horrible and depressing and probably 3 of the worst days I'll ever have. Who knows mabye i'll make some movie about these things that happen to me and make millions, anyway; Today my heart was torn in half and i walked briskly back to island crying and wanting to die, basically i walked to the beach to see eric and michelle and say hi and hang out for awhile; but they weren't there so i left cause it started raining and then i got this feeling and walked back to the beach and there they were walking back to there stuff with Michelle with her arm around his waist and ugh it was terrible, basically i just called her tonight and had a really long talk with her telling her you know how much i was hurting and everything, we just let it all out i guess and so i mean things are still kinda shaky but were going to work them out all i needed was that confirmation from her that i was more important than a boy and she didn't want to risk our friendship; that made me feel a lot better, but ah i hate this whole thing I just wish all this drama didn't happen to me. Atleast i'll have a story to tell some 16 year old girl someday and be able to tell her how my friend hooked up an atomic bomb to my heart and blew it into pieces, mabye that'll make that girl feel better. Who knows.

It was so much fun, tomorrow i'm waking up going to the beach, hanging out with eric, then i have to go to work :/ bummed. Eh, goodtimes a rollin', Stay Classy Bloggerland.

       Psh so in the first week of driving my car i have now found out that it sucks to drive. Today i was driving home on 441 with Dre and Michelle in the car, we had a lovely hour of eating and getting Jamba and were now going back to my house to skate. This was all shot down when all of a sudden my brake locked up and then my wheel jerked and my engine shut off; oh brilliant, basically i thought we were all going to die. So we pushed my car into the Coconut Creek Mitsubishi and we sat there for 2 1/2 hours cause the dumbass on the phone said that i didn't tell them where i was so they were driving up and down 441 like idiots. Which isn't even true cause i talked to the guy on the phone for like 20 mins giving him detailed directions to exactly where i was and i called them like 5 times. People are so stupid, and while i was waiting my dad took my friends home and then called me and started yelling at me basically telling me that i'm making him drive all over the place, and i need to grow up and that i have no vehicle and my friends aren't his responsibility, so now i'm sitting in my broken car by myself in 100 degree weather crying and looking for this stupid tow truck guy to get my car and take me home. Needless to say it wasn't a fun day...at all. $203.27 for a new fuel pump, mary gets to pay every penny of it.

       Today was fun hung out with Michelle and Fe, we made lots of food at my house haha, looked for a thrift store didn't find it till i had to go home and it was too late, but we did get to go to Boca Surf and Sail and oh gosh i could spend another 200 bucks there and get a nice discount. I saw missy and said hi shes doing really well. We watched Scumbag and Supply and Demand at my house, and then they had to go home for awhile, after dinner i went and picked michelle and stacey up and we went parking garage skating at this awesome garage on Camino, but then on our last run there was some idiot guard there and he was in our way so we jumped off our boards and michelles hit the tire of a nice black corvette and it started beeping and stuff, it was funny and i can say that cause there wasn't any damage. Then the guard was like this isn't a place for skating and blah blah i don't ever want to see you here again or you'll be locked up. I was like give me a freaking break you can only lock me up for a couple of hours cause i'm a minor. SO we went to the elevator to get my car and hes like why are you going to the elevator and i was like to get my stuff and hes like what? and i was like to get my stuff, and he said what? and then i was like to get my stuff! My car, you want me to leave i have to get my car to leave don't I? And he was like oh..well you get your car and i'll be down here waiting for you.  We filmed him and waved as we drove out of the parking garage, it was hilarious. Michelle and Stacey came back to my house and we played the HAHA game and I seriously have not laughed so hard in forever, my stomach still hurts. After they left i got on the computer and had a really long conversation with Eric Carter, we talked about everything, he is such a cool guy.

       So last night was fun, i went garage skating with Dre and Kc, and we met up with the Dejohns and some of the skate team guys were there but they left shortly after. Dre found this metal cage on wheels, and i was the idiot and got into it and rode down the garage; then Raychel jumped in with me and we actually made it down one floor without 50-50ing the curb in our metal box of death, so then we were hauling butt in this thing and then we hit the wall, we hit the wall so hard raychel came up from that box of death so far and then i just started laughing after the collision for like a minute straight i couldn't stop laughing from the pain and what just happened. It was awesome to say the least. I took dre out to dinner tonight for his birthday, we ate sooo much food it was ridiculous. After i got home last night, the parents interrogated me and made me tell them what was going on with me and michelle, i was like whoa parents take it easy; Dad was yelling and freakin' out, he was claiming it; so strange i was just uh ok. Swimming starts tomorrow, i'm really excited, school started monday and its so freaking easy i was like heck yes! i did a grand total of 3 hours of school today, gosh i love homeschool.

       What Fe and Jessica sent to Michelle....Its going down  "OK. Mary did not make the situation worse then what it was. You started everything Michelle. if you would have told her the truth when it happened about you and Eric, things would be a little better."  "And thanks Michelle and stacey_ we finally realized what we were doing wrong. Were completely hanging out with the wrong people. I mean for us to think that you guys were best friends"  "OH yeah.. and for you to also say to Mary "And I also think its immature of you to not pick up your phone when I call you." ahha well just for the record.. there goes the immature again. and for you to call her immature is pretty funny cause i remember that Fe, and I called about a million times and you not picking up."  "-The only thing Mary should held responsible for is being a true best friend."  Ha, i went to the beach without michelle today and i had an awesome time with fe and jessica, psh what was i thinking..

       Wanna hear something really lame?  "Well, I don't understand why that would make you feel worthless, listen Mary. Our relationship is really strong. you have done a lot of things for me, and I have done a lot for you. Because of one situation I don't think you should feel worthless"  "I just wish you could be happy for me, I know you liked him a lot and I know I made you really upset, but if I was you. And you and Eric were dating even though I liked him I would be very happy for you, and IM not just saying that because him and I are dating, I swear to you, that I would be glad for you." _Michelle Verina  My Reply...  "I don't care if you and eric date, honestly i'm over the situation; i'm hurt enough over this whole thing that its gotten to the point where it makes me not even like him i was embarressed enough last time he came down and i felt like i was driving you around on a date anyway. The whole fact of you dating was expected, i knew it was going to happen i'm not stupid. You know when we talked we both agreed to be completely honest and not lie to eachother, you said that i was more important than any boy and that you valued our friendship; well now once again i find myself pissed at you" "You know the number one thing i have a problem with is honesty, and just thinking back i just think how could i have been such an idiot, i mean you were pushing me to tell him your name and all this sh*t and i mean i stuck my neck out for the first time and talked to him and became friends, and then before i know it he knows your name, phone number, where you live, and then bam your playing with his hair leaning over his shoulder and walking down the beach with your arm around him talking about your d*mn orange juice with pulp and sleeping naked. "  So lame, over it. Saw napolean dynamite last night, it was friggin incredible, no movie will match that one, Pedro is the best. I got invited to go fishing with Mr. Gratz, Mike G., Nuke, and Wes...couldn't cause of work...so lame.

       Ah so the battle continues Mary vs. Michelle, and i believe in the future i see Mary winning. I got a call from island telling me, "hey did you know you were suppose to work at 1?" followed by me going "What?!#$)&" Stupid schedule i hate it. So i worked today...it was not bad at all but still i didn't want to work i rather have been skating.  But i work i got to see Tijers so that was cool, and yeah...thats about it, i made money.
