      Aaah--boy, does it feel good to be home. Finally I can kick back, relax, see movies with my friends, and swim in my pool heated to a delicious 85 degrees farenheit. Go California! In other news, I saw King Arthur and Anchorman this week; Anchorman was, I thought, pretty funny due to the hilarity of one of the characters (Brick) and King Arthur was, sadly, somewhat of a let-down as I expected something as epic, complex, and entertaining as  Gladiator  and I got something as profound as  Soul Plane  (even though I didn't watch it, I think I can guess here). It was interesting to see the knightly characters (Arthur, Lancelot, Gawain, Bors, Guinevere, Merlin, Galahad, Tristan) in a different, fainly Roman light, though. I would recommend them both if you have time to kill. Speaking of killing, I found out today from my GI doctor that I had a 50% chance of getting adhesions again in the next 2 years. That would make it my 3rd surgery in 2/3/4 years, depending if/when it hits. I have decided that I cannot possibly put up with the pain and crippling agony of this procedure once more and, should I require it again, refuse treatment and promptly commit suicide. So, should this blog stop suddenly and never continue, I'll leave you to guess at the outcome. 50% chance of death in 2 years. Sounds great. And I bet you thought YOUR life sucked.

      Sadly, I once find myself in front of this abysmally depressing cyclops, its evil eye casting its artificial glow on my features. I have a paper to workshop for Thursday -- it has to be turned in at 8:00 pm Wednesday at the latest. So, here I am, procrastinating until the end...nothing less will do for Lafkak! Off the subject of my incredibly depressing workload, we went to the Octagonal Barn today on our MISSION INSCRIBABLE! Hooray! I found the barn interesting but not nearly as interesting as the three cute cats roaming around the building. I promptly sat down next to one and pet it to death while attempting (and failing) to complete my mission of describing the barn in two different viewpoints and making a story out of it by introducing a second character. Yawn -- just thinking about it bores me. If it weren't for the cats, the Mission Inscribable would've been a complete loss; the story I ended up writing very poorly was, in fact, in the feline perspective -- however, I found my writing while being distracted by my furry friends tended to be bland and unimaginative. Oh well. I have plenty of opportunities to be wacky and weird later. Wish me luck with my new story (anyone have any ideas?)!

      Well, today is Sunday, the day where everyone is supposed to put down their tools and bask in the shade and rest and forget about work, right? That's what God said, right? Well, Lord, I have SINNED today! Alex, my Fiction teacher, has assigned us 20 pages to do over the weekend, and due to the Iowa Young Writers' Studio schedule, I was able to do a whole THREE yesterday! So, here I am, I need 17 pages more, and I have done 11 total. Go me. It's 2:54 in Iowa, which means I have been working for TWO AND A HALF HOURS already. ARGH!! I'll be lucky if I'm done in two and a half hours MORE! Oh well, it's an interesting story. Maybe I'll post a link to it sometime if anyone wants to hear it or even VISITS this blog. Well, I can't spare any more time, so...I hope you're having a better day than I am!

      Hey everyone -- or, more appropriately, no-one. I'll start with the basics. I'm Shane. This is my Weblog. I go by the pseudonym "Lafkak," could you tell? This site is still under construction but once it's finished I plan to fill it to the brim with stories, poems, or general thoughts that I can drag kicking and screaming from the dark recesses of my (perhaps) unstable mind. I look forward to sharing with you, and, if I'm lucky, hearing what you have to say, too. Until next time...
