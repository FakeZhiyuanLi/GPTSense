						   Our kitty,  Molly , is a computer nerd!  Every time  Dale  or  I  are on the computer  (like right now) she hears the keyboard and will come into the room and jump onto our lap or onto the desk and purrs and/or falls asleep.   She loves to watch the cursor and trys to catch it!  I'm going to go to cometcursor.com to get a mouse cursor for her to chase.  Does anyone have an idea for a "pet"  computer name we can give her?

						   Greetings to all members of the Donnell Clan and those who wish they were members! We all owe a debt of gratitude to Dan for creating this avenue of communication for our family.&nbsp; It will be a delightful adventure.&nbsp; I hope all of you will take advantage of this means of expressing your thoughts--both profound and picayune (I looked that one up).&nbsp;  Today, we can all say a belated happy birthday to John, who was born on 17 July, 21 years ago!&nbsp; Can you believe it?!&nbsp; Sweet, little baby he was...sweet, BIG MAN he IS! I must sign off and get back to work now.&nbsp; In three months and eight days, I will not EVER have to go back to work.&nbsp; YEA! I will be watching the Donnell Clan Blog for your postings. Thank you, Dan! OOO from mom

						   Yesterday, sis, tim, dale, kara, and i had fun at Lake MI Grand Haven beach.  It was Kara's first experience of "riding the waves."  Tim has done a great job of making the pier and beach more safe.  This Thursday is the Coast Guard Reunion Cruise.  We saw the big CG ships come into the channel.  Must be fun to "drive" one of those.  Tim, Dale, and, hopefully, Pat will be taking part in the festivities of the reunion day.
