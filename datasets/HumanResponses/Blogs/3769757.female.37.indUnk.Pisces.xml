						   I don't know about ya'll but, as I said before I am a nice sized girl. And every now and then I like to go out with a friend to dinner and a movie. One thing I have noticed is that some "large challenged" folks look at me as if you have no business being in the restaurant. I think this is funny. I get hungry and need to eat like every one else. I am a meat and potato gal no salads for me nothing wrong with that. All the meat and potato eating sisters say Amen. LOL talk with ya'll later, Genn

						   If you can count how many Black,Homosexual,White,etc,etc, friends you have, then they are probably not friends. Just people you think you know. True friends are not counted by race,creed, color, or sexual origination. Check yourself. We are all people. And our friends well, they are just that friends.

						   This is my first post so bare with me. I'm not the best writer in the world but I do have something to say. I am a bbw. Most people know what that is but for the few that don't that means Big Beautiful Women. Now I'm not gonna harp on that fact because other then that I'm like every other women. Which is my point. The other day someone told me that other members of their family didn't want their niece around because she made them feel uncomfortable because she was overweight, keep in mind that the girl is only ten. My mouth just fell open I could not believe the nerve of some folks. I have been heavy all my life. I know the pain that girl is feeling and will be feeling. So I decided to do a blog not just to share  my thoughts, but to enlighten if I can. We are all different that's the way The Maker intended us to be. So never judge others variety is the spice of life. So say hello to someone you never really took the time to know. Or date a person just because they made you laugh. Listen to people even If they don't have a degree. Cherish the little things. Agree to disagree. Have respect for other. But most of all accept one another with all our flaws 'cause that's the way God made us. CHOW

						    When every I here people say this I always wonder what they mean. Now that I am nearing forty I find that what I thought was old is not that old at all. People are living longer and stronger now a days. So when people say "you still go to rock concerts or you listen to rap music" I just laugh. It's what I have always done. Do what you love and love what you do. You don't stop doing what you love just because you get older. It's just when you get older you have less time to do it in. Never be afraid to cut lose every now and then. You know you want to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  GENN      &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

						    I would like to say to all of the folks who are heading back to school this Fall, take care and study hard it'll be Spring break before you know it. To all the people who are thinking of going back and getting a degree or finishing one that you've started, I say go for it. As they say you are never to old to learn. Once you get your education no one can take that from you. So good luck to you all young and old alike.  CHOW GENN
