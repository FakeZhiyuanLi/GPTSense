      today was interesting. one of the guys i've been talking to online, wich i happen to like, decided to lie to me...a lot. well, as usual, mostly everybody lies to me. i feel so stupid to believe him. i feel so stupid to believe everyone. i got pissed off, mostly hurt, and got offline. i went into the bathroom and tried to end the pain. it was too hard. so i started to cry really hard. my mom found me and sedated me. i still feel like shit. still feel like crying. but the sedatives are numbing the pain. cant live, it hurts to live. i look and feel like shit. pain is love, i suppose. and if it is...my bf really loves me. more than anyone else. death seems so great right now...but im being observed everywhere i go so i cant do anything. it sux. kill me please. please just take away the pain.

      today was really fucked up. again...i stayed up all night online, but then i got offline to sleep, and i got woken up 2 hours later. my friend had called telling me she doesn't want to talk to me ever again, cuz i said her bf is shit. i have also begun another suicidal tendancy, again. hell...life sucks. all i can do is hope it gets better. my bf is being a complete ass, and he thinks hitting me is fun. i hope that the whole world blows up soon. that would make me happy :)

      right now it's about 11:08 am, and im waiting for someone interesting to get online, *hint hint*. but other than that, im tired, as usual. my friend decided to wake me up at 10:30 am, by calling 7 times...again...verbal abuse was helpful. she's in a wedding and i miss her a lot, we're crazy together. the last time we got together we went streaking on the beach. ahhhh...good times, good times. she's 13 as well, and she's blonde (her excuse for everything :P). we are quite strange together, oh well. i also started a new novel: Stephen King and Peter Straub's Black House. along with the other couple novels im reading at the same time. (Desperation, Dark Tower IV: Wizar and Glass, Salems' Lot, and The Shining all by Stephen King and i just started Shadowland by Peter Straub. how i love a good thrill novel. that reminds me, the last thing my strange blonde friend and i did, was get flung up 350 feet in the air, and strung about by a couple of seats, a ride called 'the slingshot'. again, good times.  s0o0o0o0o0o...i guess you're being bored to death by meaningless things, so, c ya

      i slept...and then i woke up to someone poking my shoulder 0.o, having to inform them...with slight verbal abuse, that that's no way to wake me up. then i got online, waiting for people to sign on. when people did sign on, it was pretty damn cheery. i was talking to nice friendly internet people. and some strangers with candy...too bad the candy was laced...no wonder they where happy! i talked...got tired...talked...got tired...the usual. then! out of no where! :O came superman...he had a cape and he was homeless...with a bottle of 'his treasure' (whiskey). yup...damn beggers.  that's pretty much it. except the other night i almost died...it was fun...hospital people are nice and give me IV fluids that make me feel high. yeah, too bad if i pass out from sleep deprivation. sleep when you're dead.
