       I still havn't been to sleep yet... wait, I slept for like thirty minutes.  That doesn't count.      I stayed up reading Orwell's  1984  for the second time and drinking No Pulp Orange Juice.  Brice doesn't like pulp, I think he's a pussy.  It doesn't matter to me, all OJ is good.       I played guitar for awhile.   #34  is pretty damn hard to play.  It's easy, but it's hard to get it to sound right.  I don't know, maybe I just suck.      We drove to Cincy and got 900 garden mums.  What fun, me being in the back of a Ryder truck for hours.  It sucked big goat testicles.      I miss my girlfriend.  :(    I'm going to go get a shower and then go to Pimp's B-Day Party with Brice and Vickers.  It'll probably suck.  I might start going out with a new girl there, that's where I usually date my girls, the Thompson house.        I'm going to run though, I'll holler back at you later.      Peace.

       Guess what?  I'm supposed to be asleep right now.  I'm supposed to wake up in an hour and drive to Cincinnati.  I don't know why I'm still awake, I've just been thinking.       I can still smell you.      Me and Brice and Keith ate our Wendy's.  Then, Keith fell asleep and me and Brice reminisced.  We looked at all my old autographs and guitar picks.  We compared and even traded ticket stubs.  We ransacked the house looking for mementos.  I found quite a few.      I didn't do much of anything today, and it was fun.  I'm really sleepy, but I'm hungry too.  I can't go to sleep for an hour.      I jumped in the pool today for the first time.  It was really really cold.      I found out that Trapt is going to be in Morgantown the same night as me and Dustin.  I might have to go see them, for old times sake.      I'm going to go get something to eat now, I love you.  I hope you have or had fun at band and sectionals today.  Jamin, I hope you're ready to see Wilco.        I love everyone, goodnight.

       She looks like the real thing She tastes like the real thing My fake plastic love  But I can't help the feeling I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run  And it wears me out, it wears me out It wears me out, it wears me out  And if I could be who you wanted If I could be who you wanted All the time, all the time  I love this song with a passion, it's the greatest. It's called "Fake Plastic Trees" and is on  The Bends  (one of the greatest CD's of all-time). That's all.

       I don't know where I left you last, but yesterday sucked. I woke up early and went to the doctor's because my mother thought I was dying.  It  is in my lungs, whatever it is. So, I'm all on antibiotics and such.      The hour I waited in the doctor room without a shirt on was the funnest, though. Me and Mom fought the  entire  time. They could probably hear us in the waiting room. It was great, I won.       We went and ordered my gay senior pictures and then went to Taco Bell. Then, we went home.      I put all my posters up in my room, it looks alright. Then, we ate dinner.       Dustin and Troy came out for a little bit, we didn't do anything really.      Then, I got a shower, and went to Point after fighting with the parents again.      I got home around 11:40 and fell asleep before this morning came.       I woke up around 2:30 PM and now I feel like crap. I'm cold, I'm hungry (but there's no food), and I'm not sure if I'm allowed driving or not. I don't give a damn anymore, I'm just going to leave I think. I'm sick of being alone and sick of being stuck out in the goddamn country.       I'm not really angry, I threw those in for flare.       I'm going to go get a shower and then pick Brice, Kerry (not the next President), Keith (who's staying with us for four days), and Pimp (who loves suntan lotion) up. Brice wants to go to WalMart and then somewhere to eat. In the last two full days, I've only eaten twice. I hate money.      Well, I'm out of here. Bye.       P.S. Where the hell is Jamin? He must be camping with Erin, I hope he's alright. I miss that little douchebag.

       Hey guys.  It's 5:14 AM and I need to go to sleep.  I've been doing nothing, but it's been so much fun.        I talked to my girlfriend on the phone tonight, I miss her more than anything I think I've ever missed before.      I took a few more things down from my new room, downloaded a few more indie CD's from my friends on AIM, and did nothing some more.      Me and Brice watched  Ocean's Eleven...  it kicked ass.  I'd always wanted to watch it, and I'm glad I did.  I ate pepperoni and Kraft Four-Blend cheese and I'll probably get sick now.  It was good though.        Then, Brice played Playstation while I played guitar for about an hour.  Now, I'm just downloading more indie CD's and getting sleepy.      I'm going to go to bed now, I think.  I love you.      Goodnight.

       I just asked my parents if I could order jeans off the Internet.  They said I could order two pair of jeans for school, but Dad would have to put the new credit card number in the website, because if I saw it I would memorize it and buy stuff without their permission.        I must be a fucking thief to want clothes.  And bodywash... and toothepaste.  Evidently I'm some fucking bum because I just was informed that they already spent money on me today and I don't need anything else.  Well, hell,  everyone  needs toiletries.  Well, maybe not me, maybe I don't deserve them.  Forget it.        I didn't do anything today, sorry.  I went to Bob Evans and fought with my parents while my Grandma ate her chicken stir-fry.  What a lovely day.      I listened to  Parachute .  You should, too.        I raped Levi's get file on AIM and let a few random people rape mine.  It's all good in the world of file sharing and music.  I have over 135 full albums on my hard drive now.  And the great thing is, it's all been free.  I love the Internet.       I'm going to get rid of all the moose shit that clutters my new room.  I told Mom I didn't want to live in a Cracker Barrel.  I don't think she liked that too much.  You know, maybe if you wouldn't have spent so much fucking money on all those gay moose decorations, you could buy me a pair of jeans or two.  Now who really knows the value of money?      I'm sorry I'm angry and using profanity.  It's just fun, I'm sorry once again.       I'm sorry I keep apologizing.        I'm listening to a rare Ben Gibbard solo song, "A Lovely Affair".  It's great, his voice rocks and the song is very, very cool.        Me and Brice are going to go watch a movie or something.  I'll get off of here.      I really need to see you, to kiss you, to smell your skin.  I love you so much, I hope you love me the same.  I'm lost in my love for you, and I'll never find myself.  You're the greatest thing in the world.  I love you, baby.      Goodnight you stupid douches, I need some food, I've only ate once today.  Maybe I don't deserve food either, you know, food cost money.  Hell, I might just go kill my dog Max and eat him, that would be a free meal.  But then again, I might have to use the stove to cook him and then that would cost money to use electricity.  I quit.      Keep it real, I love you all... well, most of you.

       Guster kills me.  Nobody understands that, nobody cares.  They havn't met them twice; they didn't hear the beauty of the unplugged  Jesus on the Radio , that was almost religious.  They don't understand.      Perfect example: the song  Parachute .  This is, I swear, one of the most beautiful songs ever.  You might be lost in the same A-G-G-D chord progression.  You might think the lyrics aren't very clever.  Please, God, just listen to the song.  Please.  I get so emotional listening to it, I want you to feel that.  For anything that's ever put you down or bothered you, listen to this song.  Get it's message: it's beautiful.  I've cried listening to this song.  The end is the greatest thing of all-time.  The redemption is great, when not only Ryan Miller, Adam Gardner, and Brian Rosenworcel realize that there's always someone there looking out for them, but   when  you  realize that you're not alone, there'll always be someone there for you.  In my case, it is my girlfriend Jami.  I realized this last night when even my parents turned against me, and I was left alone.  She came and picked me up, and for her I am forever grateful.  I don't deserve her, but I swear that I'll love her as best as I can for the rest of my life, with everything within me.        Here are the lyrics to  Parachute :      There we stand    About to fly   Peeking down over land   Parachute behind   What was that moment for   Which we live   Without a parachute   About to die      Find my self convincing   Blindly falling faster   How easy   Know the place I'm leaving   And the rest is just gone      Oh the adoration   But how much strength does it take   For exploration   For split decision   Are you stronger to remain      Find my self convincing   Blindly falling faster   How easy   Know the place I'm leaving   And the rest is just gone      It crept up on me   Ignored all my pleas   Begging to leave   No justice to maim me   Fell out of the sky   Cease it to be   Without a reply   Gravity fails me   When I awoke   I knew what was real   Hope to convince you   Lies they all torture me   Opened the door   Knew what was me   I finally realized   Parachute over me      I'm in tears and I love you.  I love this song, I love this blog.  I've got to go, though.  Goodbye.

       Right now, I'm sitting at my house.  I'm going to be here all day, possibly all week.  How shitty is that?  I'm stuck in the place that I hate most, without the person that I care about most.  I'm screwed.        I've been alone all day.  I'm cold, hungry, and bored to death.  I love this lifestyle.      Nothing new here, obviously, just thought I'd drop a post.      I love you.

       Fuck me... I can't win.  I just walked in the door an hour late and my mom comes out of her room and says "Holt, if I were dying of cancer, would you care?"  She hasn't talked to me in two days, and she asks me a dumb question like that... how pitiful.  She knows I would care.  I quit.        Oh well, I better give you a boring recap of the past two days.  I stayed up til' 5 AM burning CD's for Jamin, well into Sunday morning.  I woke up three hours later and struggled through church and youth.  Then, my family went to Dairy Queen.  Me and Brice discovered waffle fries.        I came home, got Jamin's CD's, and was right out the door to his cookout.  I ate two hotdogs and a hamburger and then gave him his present.  He gave me a Kerry/Edwards sign.  I'm going to miss that douchebag, he's like the best friend I have... but don't have.  It's really messed up.  Hopefully I can go down and visit him in September.        From Jamin's cookout, I came home and hauled my room from upstairs to the loft above the garage.  It's basically like a mini-apartment, nobody bugs me.  I havn't finished it yet, but I'm working on it.  Mom and Dad were pissed, but they'll get over it.  I did laundry and downloaded CD's from Levi, and then I took and shower and went to Jami's to stay the night.      I love her so much, she melts my heart.  Just lying with her in my arms, it kills me, it reallys does.  I swear to you, I could die and I wouldn't notice... yes, it's  that  nice.  I love you, Jami.      Anyway, we woke up this morning and took showers and met the group at McDonald's (started by Ray Kroc in 1956).  I fell asleep in Butch's van with a girl's head on my shoulder; not Jami's but Meanaaaen's (or something like that).  I had a really good time at King's Island, except for one small thing: I don't fit in with her friends.  I don't know if they don't like me, or they're just too concerned about themselves.  I  know  that atleast one of them thinks they're better than me.  I don't care, you know.  I'm  me .  I don't want to be anyone else, you don't have to go out of your way to make yourself feel better, smarter, more distinguished.  Just stop, please.        I wish Jamin were here, he'd say it for me: "Fuck the stupid yuppies"      At King's Island, we rode White Water Canyon like three times until all of us were soaked.  It was a blast.  Then, me and Jami fell asleep and just did nothing.  It was fun.  We left then.        Anyway, we came back to Jami's and I whined and wasted all of our alone time.  I'm sorry, I really am.  I won't do it again.  I was with you for over 24 hours and I miss you already.  I love you, baby.      Eh, right now I'm burning a copy of Guster's  Parachute  because I tried listening to it in the car and my CD is worn out or something, it wouldn't play.  It really sucked.        Tomorrow I have no idea what is going on.  My parents didn't speak to me and I don't know if I have a car or not.  I don't know anything.  So, I'm going to set my alarm for about nine and see what happens.  I hope I make it.        I'm so in love with you it's not funny.      Keep cool my douche bags, I'm going to sleep.  And to the people I don't like: "Kiss my ass, you pansy motherfuckers".  There, now I feel better, Tuesday.  ;)

       It's 4:41 AM and I havn't been asleep yet.  I've been up making Jamin's present.  Jamin, I can't say what it is, because I don't want to ruin it.  Oh, well, you'll find out tomorrow at your cookout.      Jami, I still smell like you, darling.  It's killing me about right now.  I think I might go to sleep for a few hours.  Goodnight angel.

       I don't even remember what you're called, I just know that you're going to end up bald.  :)    I just got back from your house, you're so wonderful.  I'm in love with you.      I stayed up last night thinking about you, I missed you being in my arms.        This morning I woke up at like 1 PM.  I know, I suck really bad.  I'm so sorry.  I took a shower and then Vickers and I went to Gino's, his grandma's, and then the prestigious Mason County Fair.  We stayed a little while and then went home.  I got in my car and drove to Jami's.        I suck.      Right now, I'm talking to Nathan on AIM, he's cool as hell.  It'd be alot easier if fucking Beth would stop IMing me... I never even reply, why does she still do it?  I don't know anymore.      I gave Roush my bootlegged copy of Fahrenheit 9/11, complete with a slam and a mom joke.  He loves it.  I can't wait for him to get his camera developed, he's gonna cry.  Haha, I'm so stupid.      I know I'm just rambling on about nothing, I really have no life outside of my love.  When Brice gets done eating his fries we're going to go watch the episodes of Seinfeld he just burnt to DVD.        Tomorrow I'm going to go to church and then Jamin's cookout.  That reminds me, I have to burn Jamin's CD's for him.  Hmm... I'll do that now.      Well, folks, I'm going to run.  If you want something else to read, check out my baby Tuesday's blog, she finally updated it.  ;)      I'm out of here children, keep it cool.  I love you, goodnight.

I can't think of anything more.  I still smell like you though, maybe that will help me finish it.  I don't know, I suck at songwriting.  I just started singing this in my head on the way home from your house, trust me, it has a melody.  Just not a singer worth singing it to you.      Goodnight.  I'm blogged out, I've made like 43234 posts today.  Sorry, I love you.

       Not much I'm going to say, it's 1:13 AM and me and Brice are going to go watch  Fargo .        I just got done having the talk, it went well.  I cried, hid, and said "fuck" about twenty times.  All is well, and I think they are finally crasping it.  I don't know, I just know it's OK, I'm not in trouble.      So I'm hanging with my girlfriend and she just vomits... no joke.  I'm sorry.      I'm going to sleep now, go take a shower and listen to "At Least That's What You Said" cranking full blast.  It'll make you feel alot better.       And, so I don't forget, thank you.  You are incredible, you know why.  I love you, baby.        Good night all you dickheads out there in wonderland... haha, I don't know why, I just think that's funny.  I'm sorry, I suck.      Anyway, keep cool my babies, keep the fluid in you and a wet rag on your forehead.  No, maybe it was just my fault.        I love you all.

       Here, after feeding songs down your throat every day, I will give you more.      Don't be angry, you  need  these songs.  If you don't have  all  of them, you better hurry and get them before you're labeled uncool.  Only kidding, you probably won't like half of them, but I love them all, so you should give them a shot.  Plus, I'd give everyone else's a shot, but no one ever tells me anything.  :)    We'll start off with good ol' JM.  I know you think John Mayer, and anyone that likes John Mayer, are flaming homosexuals.  The truth is, the man can play guitar and write good songs.        "In Your Atmosphere (LA Song)"- This one is unreleased, how JM's best songs usually stay.  He only breaks this out once or twice a year, it's his most beautiful one, most likely my first or second fave of his.  You should find it on KaZaa, but if not, IM me and I'll send it to you.  I don't want you to go without.        "Covered in Rain (Live from Any Given Thursday)"- This is the all-time favorite for me.  The emotion and the guitar solo and everything... it's beautiful, I love it.  Make sure it's from Any Given Thursday though, just so you have the best version.      Next, you need Ryan Adams in your system.        Here, take all of these: "Wildflowers", "When the Stars Go Blue", "World War 24", "Call Me on Your Way Back Home", "La Cienega Just Smiled", and "Goodnight, Hollywood Blvd."  That should last you for awhile, when you're done call me and I'll give you some more.        Radiohead, Radiohead, Radiohead... where do we begin?  I'll give you one song from each album or so to give you a taste.  This is going to be hard.        From  The Bends,  download "Just".  It's not my favorite, that would be "Street Spirit", "Bulletproof... I Wish I Was", "Fake Plastic Trees", "The Bends", and "Black Star".  OK, just by the whole damn CD, it's in my top five all-time albums.        Download the rest of these Radiohead songs: "Exit Music (For a Film)", "Karma Police", "Paranoid Android", "The Tourist", "Everything in It's Right Place", "Kid A", "The National Anthem", "Idioteque", "Motion Picture Soundtrack", "Sail to the Moon", "Where I End and You Begin", and "A Wolf at the Door".        There's so many more Radiohead songs, just download those for a start.  They are all wonderful songs.  Just like all the others I've recommended.       Here are ten more songs for now, I'll leave you alone then.       1- "Jimi Thing" by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, Live at Luther College   This song is great, but it contains the outro "What Will Become of Me", which is important for three reasons.        A) It contains one of my favorite, if not THE favorite, chord progression.     B) It later became "Pantala Naga Pampa", the first song off of  Before These Crowded Streets , one of my top five albums ever.     C) It's where I got the name of my blog.   Heh.  :)      2- "Pigeon" by Jump, Little Children.  Jay Clifford's voice is one of the greatest things ever.  No, I'm not gay either, I just appreciate a good voice when I hear it.       3- "A Movie Script Ending" by Death Cab for Cutie.  It's great... I love it...      4- "Tripping Billies" by Dave Matthews Band (Remember Two Things version).  DMB kicks so much ass it isn't funny.  I've been rocking out to this one lately, you'll like it.  All of you will.       5- "Wounded" by Third Eye Blind.  This is the stuff that they are capable of.        6- "#41" by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, Live at Luther College.  It's beautiful.      7- "Dancing Nancies" by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, Live at Luther College.  OK, OK.  So Live at Luther College rocks... just buy the double-album.  If you can't, I'll burn it for you and mail it to you, each and every one of you.      8- "War on War" by Wilco.  "You have to lose... you have to learn how to die if you ever want to be alive".  Jeff Tweedy, you're a genius.        9- "Grace" by Jeff Buckley.  Jefffffffffff.... I love you...       and last but not least,      10- "Happier" by Guster.  "Happier" is about high-school life.  You'll like it, it rocks.      I'm out for now, but thanks for bearing with me.  I love you all.      Keep cool my babies.

       Anything for you   Turn my castles blue    Turn my bones to sand   Just to see you   I'll give you anything   I'll give you anything    Jackie O with the top down open   All the words to what's unspoken   Put together everything that's broken     Just to see you   I'll give you anything   I'll give you anything   I'll give you anything     Jackie O with the top down open   A king's horse for what's been broken   I'll bring back even what's unspoken     Just to see you   I'll give you anything   I'll give you anything         OK, so I know it's supposed to be about Jackie and JFK getting shot and all, but I love the emotion in it.  It's great, I forgot all about it until I found it on this old computer.  Third Eye Blind need to stop being so damn gay and make good music again.  I love this song, download it.     Oh, it's called "Anything".  I love you.

       I am so happy right now.  The last few days have been wild and I've loved every minute of it.        I'm sorry for everything I've ever done to make you feel bad.  I love you more than anything and you know it.  You should know it by now, at least.  I love you.        I woke up and I was with you.  That, quite possibly, is the greatest thing in the world to me.  I woke up and you wrapped your arms around me.  I could die in that moment, darling, you mean everything to me.        Since my last real depressing post, that I wish I would have never written, not much has happened.  But... I'll fill you in, anyway.        Me and Brice watched  Shattered Glass , which turned out to be really good, and  Igby Goes Down .  The latter was a poor attempt to exploit Salinger's classic,  The Catcher in the Rye , but it was a good movie, none the less.  I liked it.        We saw THE bug that night, and decided to sleep upstairs.  You would have, too.  Trust me.     I told my love I would come to her house early... well, I overslept.  I overslept alot.  It's all good though, she still loves me, I'm sure of it.        I spent a few hours with her, then I drove to Pomeroy and ate with Jamin and John-Pat at Pizza Hut.  I always have a good time when I'm with them, we can talk music, politics, and life.  It's all good with the Riley's.  (Don't get me wrong, Jamin, you're still pretty gay)      Then, I drove home and talked to my parents for a few minutes, got a shower, and lied to them.  I told them I was staying at my cabin.  We both knew that's  really  not where I was going to stay.  Oh well, they can get over it.        I got to stay allnight with the one person who holds my heart in her hands.        We stayed up nearly half the night, then we woke up at six.  I woke up a few more times until I left, each time staring at the love I held in my arms.  I thanked God for you, I felt your skin against mine.  You're a blessing.  I'm in love with you.       The damn cleaning lady came 45 minutes early, so I guess our little secret is out.  You say, it's alright, so I'm going to believe you.        I took Brice to get a hair cut and then we went and picked Jamin up and ate at Dairy Queen.  Now, I'm killing time until I can see Jami again.        I'm out for now people, I love you all.  Wait, no... I don't.  :)      Keep cool my babies.

       Hey my friend   It seems your eyes are troubled   Care to share your times with me   Would you say you're feeling low and so   A good idea would be to get it off your mind      See, you and me   Have a better time than most can dream   Have it better than the best   And so can pull on through   Whatever tears at us   Whatever holds us down   And if nothing can be done   We'll make the best of what's around      Turns out not where but who you're with   That really matters   And hurts not much when you're around      If you hold on tight   To what you think is your thing   You may find you're missing all the rest   She run up into the light surprised   Her arms are open   Her mind's eye is      Seeing things from a   Clearer side than most can dream   On a better road I feel   So you could say she's safe   Whatever tears at her   Whatever holds her down   And if nothing can be done   She'll make the best of what's around      Turns out not where but what you think   That really matters   And hurts not much when you're around      I need this song.  It makes me smile.  I love you.

       I'm gonna go ahead and say that today sucks.  Tonight, coupled with a poor afternoon and mediocre evening makes it official.  I've accomplished nothing; if anything, I've made things worse for everyone.  I'm glad I have that power.     You know, my main concern is to just be kind to people, and in my quest for that I somehow get everyone mad at me.  I try so hard, too.  I'm constantly running around, like I'm on fire, just doing stuff for people.  I can't win.  I've accepted that, through my seventeen years of life, I can't and will never win.  I can't please people.  I quit.      That was pretty depressing, I'm sorry.  I just feel like crying right now.      I woke up and drank a glass of orange juice and a glass of milk.  I took the pill that doesn't help me.  I drove to the plantation and fed Max, Tiger, and Whitey.  Then, I mowed grass for too long.      Then, I actually ate something for once.  I got a shower, and drove to my girlfriend's house.  I stayed there for longer than forty-five minutes, then I went to the fair: probably the biggest mistake I made today.  Not for the fact that it's the fair, but for the look in my girlfriend's eyes when I left.  I hate it.      I saw alot of people tonight that I care about.  I saw alot of people tonight that care about me.  I can't throw those people away, I feel like I've neglected them.  It's my fault, no one elses.      Milen walking around the fair with his Dad almost brought me to tears.  To see his face light up when we made eye contact killed me.  I feel ashamed.  He tells me that I'm his best friend ever, and he's serious.  Knowing how I treat him, and knowing how he feels about me, I just want to die.     It's like that with everyone though.  I'm always telling Kyle I'll call him, but I never do.  It's just easier for me, but it probably gives him more of a chance to go get in trouble.  If I'd hang out with him more, then maybe he'd stop doing some of the things he does.      This is where I'm at my crossroads.  Why is it MY responsibility to care for these people, to take them under my wing and show them love through actions, not words.  I don't know.  That's two people, but there's so many more.      I don't want to be held accountable for things when I die, but I don't think it's fair for me to stop the life that I've waited so long to live to help everyone.      Beth is another example.  When she probably needed me the most, I started ignoring her.  I know that hurt her more than anything.  Why did I do it?  Because she got on my nerves and made everything worse.      Funny how everything turns out.      I saw alot of people tonight that have hurt me in the past.  To look into their eyes and smile, and show them that I'm happy being myself and not the superficial teenagers that the world tells them to be makes me happier than anything.  I love people, I hate people.  Aren't I confusing?      I think now I'm just ranting.  But, I don't have anyone to talk to about this, I'm on my own again, just like always.  Nobody would understand, even if I tried to explain it to them.  I don't even think I understand.     I took Jamin home and told him I'd hang out with him before he leaves.  I probably won't see him until Sunday.  I'm sorry bro, I love you more than anything.  You're the one friend I respect the most and probably trust the most.  You're loyal.  You're the best.      Right now, Brice is playing some stupid game on Playstation 2.  Mama Dottie and Brogan are asleep, probably in matching nightgowns.  Mom and Dad are in Indiana, having fun without their family.  Dustin is with his girlfriend.  Troy is probably home watching TV.  Jami is with Tracy and Joel somewhere.      And I'm here.  I'm right here.  I'm always here.    Keep cool children, and don't let the cruel world defeat you.  Find joy in something or someone you care about, hold on with all that you have.  Never let go.  When things get rough, don't dwell on them.  Love.  Don't be afraid to cry, emotions are honest.  And if nothing at all, love.  Love with all you have.      Alright, so I'm not Confuscius, but I'm pretty close.  Remember that.  I'll wake up tomorrow morning and I'll be better, everyone has rough days.  I'll be fine.      I'm sorry for everything I've ever done to hurt anyone.  Please, forgive me.  Thanks.        I love you.

       I don't want to go to sleep. I can't go to sleep.     I woke up this morning at 2... PM. I hate sleeping so late, I feel like I've missed the whole day. I took Jamin back to his Grandma's in Middleport, and then came to New Haven.     I took four pills at once, it was good. I feel alot better right now, it's about time. I've been taking those damn antibiotics for about 3 months.    I'm really happy right now, although you probably can't tell. Anyway...    After New Haven, I took my darling to the fair for her band concert. She did exceptional. She's so cute, I love her so much. We walked around the fair for a few minutes, then went back to her house.     She's incredible. I'm telling you, I'm in love with her so bad it's not funny.   It's 2:30 AM and all I want to do right now is hold her. She's my baby.     Oh, and I'm actually watching TV for once. I just don't watch it  all  the time, like some people. :) I don't feel like watching Futurama. I feel like watching you.     Hmm... now what to say. I'm really bored. Brice is snoring beside me. Argh.     I might as well go to sleep, there's nothing better to do. I've thought about you since I left you, I should probably stop. Don't get me wrong, I'll dream about you.     Today's  Songs  to Illegally Steal from Kazaa: "Poor Places" by Wilco and "Wildflowers" by Ryan Adams.     Poor Places for the fact that it has the most kick-ass guitar part in history, right after Tweedy sings "I'm not going outside". Yeah, just ask Jamin; he knows.     Wildflowers is beautiful. Ryan Adams, once again, breaks me.     "Cause tonight she's sleeping alone... without him."     It makes me think of you, and how I long for the day that I don't have to leave.  I can't wait.  I'm so in love with you, Jami.      Keep cool my babies, I'm out.

       Alright, alright.  I don't know where I left you last, faithful reader, but I'm sure you want to know all about what has happened to me today.      I picked Dad up for lunch and we had a heart-to-heart for close to two hours over Subway.  Alot of things were resolved.  It was alright.      I went home and to New Haven, and home, and to New Haven, and home, and to New Haven.       I listened to Ryan Adams alot.  He breaks my heart.        I thought the day would end without me seeing your smile, but somehow I was lucky.  I was blessed to gaze into your eyes, you refresh me.  Just ten minutes in your prescence makes me feel alive.       I love you.       Me and Jamin and Dustin and Tory went to Wendy's together.  Dustin and Tory never showed up here though, I think they're having sex or something.       Me and Jamin hooked up his new 4-Track Recorder and messed around til' about now.        It's 3:27 AM.        I talked to Jami around 1 AM, she was worrying about her mom and things that happened in the past.  I told her that she didn't need to worry about that any more, that it's different now, and that I'm always ALWAYS here for her, no matter what.  I'm in love with her.       I'm going to go hang out with Jamin some more before he goes back to VA.        Goodnight.      Tonight's Song to Illegally Steal Off Kazaa is: "All Along the Watchtower" by Holt Barnitz and Jamin Riley.        Wait... we just recorded that one about an hour ago, you'll have to wait til' next week to download it.  ;)      I love you.      Keep cool my babies.

       Howdy.  Right now, after a wild turn of events, I am at my grandmother's house.  We'll get to that later.  First, I have to tell you about one of the greatest days of my life.      I woke up Sunday morning, took a shower, and left.  Nobody knew where I was going, except my mother.  I got to Jami's house around 9 AM; it was our four month anniversary.  Now, I know what you're thinking: "Four months, so what?"  Trust me, these past four months have been the BEST four months that I've been alive.  You know what the cool thing is?  It just keeps getting better.      Jami didn't know I was coming, she was still asleep.  Val the Gal, complete with wet hair and bathrobe, let me inside.  I crawled in bed with Jami and kissed her on the cheek.  I put my arm around her, as I've done so many times before, and she knew I was there.  She knew me.  I love that more than anything.  :)    We hung out, we went to breakfast together.  I spent the entire day with her, which is what I can't wait to do for the rest of my life.  She's amazing.  Holding her in my arms, I can't begin to understand how I can feel the way that I do about her.  It's just pure love.  I'm in love with her.  I always will be.      I got home last night, feeling tired.  I took a shower and layed in my room, under the cool air from my ceiling fan.  I began thinking of Jami, I'm always thinking about her.  She consumes me.  I wish I never had to leave her side.  Someday, hopefully, I won't have to.      Mom and Dad came and put their two cents in while I was laying in bed.  It's too late for them to intervene.  I've already grown too far in love for my parents to try to pull me out.  I'd do and have done pretty much everything it takes to break their simple rules.  They don't understand me, they can't fathom the thought of me loving someone so much.  It almost makes me wonder if they love each other.  They anger me, they expect too much.      Anyway, I'll stop whining now.  No... no, I won't.    I woke up a little before 5 AM this morning.  I got and shower and rode to Huntington with Dad to pick up a Ryder truck to deliver seedlings with.  He got the truck, and I drove home by myself in the fog.     I was supposed to work today.  I can't.  I went for a half an hour and still didn't have anything to do.  I don't fit in there, I don't have a place like I used to.  It might be my own fault, but it doesn't matter to me now.  I have other ways to make money.  I'll be alright.    So, I'm at my grandmother's house right now, and she is the only person that knows where I am.  Well, Brice might know, but he's asleep on the couch here beside me.      Brogan has to get a root canal today, poor thing.  I hope she's alright.      Also in the news, the prestigious Mason County Fair starts today.  This is the first year I can remember that I don't have a fair pass.      Oh well, I better go eat some lunch.    Today's Mid-day Song to Steal off Kazaa: "In Your Atmosphere (LA Song)" by John Mayer.     Shutup, just download it.  :)    Keep cool my babies.

       I love Jami Lee Calandros. It's been four months that I don't deserve. Right now, I am the happiest I think I have ever been, spare my damn earache. Oh well, the wonder that is antibiotics will take care of that, if only I take them all.       Today was a weird day, I woke up like 34 times and couldn't remember what day it was. I woke up at 6 AM, 9 AM, 11 AM, 12 PM, and 2 PM. Then, I got a shower and fell asleep. I woke up at 3 PM. Then I called Jami. Soon after, I fell asleep. I woke up at 4:30 PM. I took a shower and was supposed to go to her house. But, I fell asleep. I woke up around 6 PM. I ate some soup and then we left the house and I fell asleep again. I woke up around 7:30 PM at Jami's. We layed around and then I'm pretty sure I fell asleep a few more times. I left her house at 12 AM.       I hate being sick.       I don't know what much else to say other than I'd write more if I wasn't asleep all day. Sometime I'm going to haul all my stuff up to the loft and me and Brice are going to set up camp in there. There'll be two empty rooms upstairs, but that'll be good since Mom is talking about adopting some Chinese baby or something.       I'm talking to Nick on AIM. He's cool as heck. I miss all those guys from GHA, although I don't miss the stupid classes, Lightning Bolt Boy, mirimba bands, and wearing that gay nametag.       I'm going to go get some sleep everyone, I need it.       Today's Song to Illegally Steal from Kazaa is: "Mother's Eyes" by Jump, Little Children. You might not be able to handle it, but I love it to death. Not as much as Jami, though.      Oh, I almost forgot. The Vote for Change Tour.       Dave Matthews Band   REM   Pearl Jam   Bruce Springsteen   Death Cab for Cutie   Bright Eyes      I've signed up to get advance tickets. Now if only I can see Wilco with Jamin then my life will be complete. Don't give your ticket to John, I'll drive to Norfolk, brother. Hah.       I'm out, y'all.       Keep cool my babies.

       Alright, I'm back.  I bet all you readers are excited... not.  Well, I won't bore you too much, I'll just write like I usually do.      Dad woke me up Thursday morning at 7 AM and told me I had to follow him to Gallipolis and bring him home.  So, I'm just cruising with the windows down, listening to my man Dave.  I even passed my lovely unsuspecting girlfriend on the way home.  We went through McDonald's and got food to go and went and ate breakfast in my marjar's office.  We had a typical intelligent conversation like always, with me coming out on top.  I'm so smart.      I went back to my second home, my Grandma's house, (my first home is Jami's) and talked to her while she sucked the smoke from a burning piece of paper.  She's been smoking since she was twenty and it scares me to death.  I fell asleep and woke up at 12:50.  I sped home, threw some clothes in the dryer to get the wrinkles out, took a shower, folded the clothes, and sped down the road.  I met Mom and Dad at the Mexican restaurant owned by my lovely girlfriend and they gave me some cash flow.  Don't worry, they'll get it all back on their prompt schedule, money is a big issue for them.  I hate money, by the way, I hate it to death.        Anyway, I went to Jamin's and we left for our big adventure.  I slept most of the way and then we arrived at Riverbend Music Center.  Ladies and gentlemen, here is where the fun begins.  I will probably use alot of profanity in this next part, forgive me ahead of time.        I fucking hate beer.  I hate yuppie girls, as Jamin calls them.  I hate posers, I hate wannabes.  I hate tall people with fat heads that stand in front of me when I want to see the stage.  I hate obese girls that wear skin tight clothes.  I hate preppie boys that listen to music because it's cool, not because they reflect with it and feel it in their soul.  And, I fucking hate alcohol.        I met Nathan at the concert, he was cool as hell.  I'm pretty sure the only thing we have in common is our love for music, but it's alright.  We're going to trade some CD's and all, he's a nice guy.  I also met two guys named Kevin and Chad, who actually liked listening to music as opposed to drinking beer.  People love their beer, especially the shitdick who spilled it all over my pants because he was too hammered to walk.  What a winner.        Anyway, I met Guster  again .  I talked to them for a second and got their autographs  again  and this time I got a pick from Ryan.  They thought it was cool I still had my ticket stub from the Athens show and liked my shirt that wasn't available anymore.  They're good guys, they have good music, too.       Dave's set was good.  It could have been better, spare the 11 PM noise ordinance Ohio has.  Stupid buckeyes cost me  Crush, #41,  and  Two Step.   Oh well, I'll see them again sometime.       We drove back to Jason's kickass apartment and hung out there til' the wee hours of the night.  Me and Jamin and Jason played guitar and Jamin told me stories and showed me pictures of the life he'd probably rather be living right now, a life in Norfolk.  Who can blame him though, this place is depressing.  I can't wait for me and my angel to bust free of it, as soon as possible.        We woke up at 12 and ate Buffalo Wild Wings and talked politics for a while.  Then, we drove home at 2 and arrived home at 5:30.  I had a really good time.       As  soon  as I got home, I was right back in the car headed to Parkersburg.  We went to Home Depot and Outback, and I'm really getting bored of telling myself about my life.  I hope someone other than me will read this sometime.  I know Jami will, maybe, I love her to death.  She's the greatest thing that has EVER happened to me.        As a matter of fact, I just got home from her house.  She was worn out from taking care of her dad and being stressed about Val.  I love her so much, I wish I would have been there for her that night, but I was gone.  I feel like I've let her down and it breaks my heart.  I'd do anything for her, anything.  I hope she knows that.        Well, my aficionados, I am going to go watch the movie  Signs  with Brice.        Today's Song to Illegally Steal off Kazaa is: "#41" by Dave Matthews Band, because  he  didn't play it in Cincinnati, but  we  did.        "Why won't you run in the rain and play?  Let the tears splash all over you."      Keep cool my babies.

       Wow. I am  definitely  in love. It feels great, too. It's the greatest thing that has EVER happened to me. I'm without words. She fills me to the brink with love and then smiles and I overflow with love. She is love.  We  are love.  I woke up this morning with Jamin beside me (tempting I know). Our night of politics had finally ended with me being asleep and Jamin and Tory watching  Fahrenheit 9/11 Bootleg Edition  (thanks Brice and Kazaa). Dustin dropped by for a few before stumbling back to his car, leaving me to suspect he was under the influence of something... maybe Megan. Jake never showed. And Tory did what only Tory does best and left in the middle of the night.  I took Jamin to his grandma's house in New Haven, not the one that got hit by a pig. I met up with the AP folk at Pizza Hut a little after noon. I'm not only late for class every day, I'm late for lunch, too. I suck. Anyway, we had a good ol' time... actually, no, we didn't. Me and Dustin sat there and talked the whole time at a separate table while everyone else just sat there and pretended to like each other. High school is bullshit.  After that adventure at Pizza Hut, I mowed my grandmother's yard so I could pay for gas to drive to Jami's. I live day to day. I'm still waiting for that huge sum of money to just fall in my lap. As Bill Lumbergh would say, "That'd be great".  I went to Jami's and stayed there until around 7. Then we drove to the movies. We saw  Thunderbirds, The Notebook, The Village,  and  Catwoman.  We watched  Catwoman  the longest and then drove to Mason to make out, because making out in the same place every day just gets old (no, it doesn't). We arrived in Mason and figured out that making out is fun everywhere, but it's funner in bed. So, we went back to our room. I love her.  Val the Gal didn't make Varsity. Poor thing, you would have thought Josh had broken her heart. As it turns out, she would rather be a Varsity cheerleader than have Josh. I'm confused. But, she's still the sister of the girl I'm madly in love with. I wish her the best.  Right now I'm getting ready to go to bed. Tomorrow is the big day (Dave Matthews Band  and  Guster)!  I love you, Jami. Happy blogging, honey.  Today's Song to Illegally Steal from Kazaa is: "A Lack of Color" by Death Cab for Cutie.  "If you feel discouraged when there's a lack of color here, please don't worry lover, it's really bursting at the seams"  Keep cool my babies... and Jami's a baby's a baby's a baby... I'm a douche, I know. :)

       Ah, yes. Here's a kickass website found by my cohort, Dustin Cody Vickers. You can upload pictures and use them as wallpaper on your cellphones. How cool is that?       urlLink  Zedge: Free ringtones, free wallpaper, free themes, free downloads to Nokia and other mobile phones.

       So how's it going?  I'm moved on in life, I'm starting a blog.  Oh joy!  So, what used to be a simple LiveJournal is now something prestigious.        To read my prior ruminations, go here:   urlLink  www.livejournal.com/~elliottjones       Alright, back to recording the accounts of my life as I biasely see them.   I woke up at noon and made a pizza-sandwich (another sandwich I've pioneered).  Then, I got dressed and went to work; man, what a mistake.  I did slave labor for 5 hours and made the same amount of money my little brother makes mowing a lawn in a half-hour.  Bullshit.        Right now I'm currently "grounded" for not coming home on time from Jami's last night.  I don't care, other than not getting to see her.  She could drive out here, but I don't think she wants to do that.  Plus, I don't want her to wreck or something.  I love her.      I'm going to go get Jamin and my guitar and then Dustin and Tory will come out here.  We'll all pretend like we're best friends when, in reality, we're not.  It's funny.        I'm going to go get a shower or something and scrounge to find a bite to eat.        What a way to start off this blog, with nothing exciting.  I'm sorry, I've been in a state of nirvana these last two weeks.  I feel like I've experienced more love in the last two weeks than I have in the previous seventeen years.  It's amazing, she's amazing.  I love her more than life.        I'm heading out, thanks for reading.        Also, today's Song to Illegally Steal off Kazaa: "The Stone" by Dave Matthews Band.      "I was just wandering if you'd come along.  Tell... me... you... will..."        Keep cool my babies.
