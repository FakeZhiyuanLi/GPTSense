        Huh! My friend Vidya 2T1 wanted me to patch up back as a normal friend. I sent a letter ro him and appologised to him and ask him whether he still want to be my friend or not. Well he did reply to me that he will be my friend and he wants me to stop all the rumours between me and him. He warns me that I am forbidden to talk to him when I coincidently meet him. Well I think patching up back with him was not a good idea anyway. Well I just turned a new leaf and forget all my past.

        Wow....Today I got to go for a student councillor interview. I'm so anxious about the interview. Before I enter the interviewing room, I got confidence in myself. But when I was being interviewed by some of the senior student councillor. I lose my confidence when stupid shorty(Hafiz)came to hear me get interviewed. I just shut myself up after that. After the interview I'm really relieved that I really went through the  interview.

        Today is the last day at Jalan Bahtera. I can't really wait to go home. After eating our breakfast, all of us clean up the whole camp. At 10.30am, we took pictures of our groups and also other groups. My teacher gave us our camp T-shirts. After that, we went back home by our school bus.

        Today is the second and last day at Jalan Bahtera. The second activity for the camp activity my group did was Rope Course. Out of 4 I only did 2 of the Rope Course. After Rope Course, we did our third activity that was Orienteering. Orienteering is basically about finding hidden things with the clues we have. After lunch we went for a trip to Little India. The trip really make me exhausted. At night, we have a campfire. My group presented two songs, Father Abraham and Five Hundred Miles.

        Today the whole Sec 2 went to Jalan Bahtera MOE Adventure centre. I brought my camping stuffs into my backpack. Well I can't really wait to reach the place itself. The first activity my group did was kayaking towards Sungei Buloh. It was quite fun. At night we have a night walk. The surroundings were quite creepy.

        Today after recess, during contact time, a whole group of Sec 2 student councillor(that includes shorty(Hafiz))finding me. Meera the representative of the student councillor group told me that shorty wanted to talk to me after school at 1.30pm but I said to Meera that I have Science remedial at that time. At 1.30pm, Miss Kathijah decided that she is not having her Science remedial as we are in a mood of going home. Well I went to the Concourse finding that shorty but all I saw was Ade and Meera. I asked Meera where that shorty go, she replied that he went home. I think he is a coward as he run away go home when he supposed to wait for me to talk to me what an idiot and coward he is. I think he wanted to talk about personal matter but not school matter.
