      i believe i've stumbled onto an answer to that which is most difficult. yes, everyone may have their versions and true, there are certain things that i believe no one can dispute as not difficult...the passing of a close one, the passing of multiple close ones, war and itz cummulative effects on all involved, granted some more than others in regards to the degree, transition, change, ignorance, and certain realizations as the years go by and the so-called 'wisdom' increases. as a matter of fact, i don't think anyone wiser than the youth, and the younger, the wiser. they are consistently open to new things, new ideas, new realities, new perceptions of realities. anyways, i'm going off on a tanget now, and it is exactly these sorts of things that make what is most difficult even that much harder grasp.  it's most difficult for one who has made it a conscious point to base all actions, thoughts, decisions, beliefs, and, most importantly, hopes, on a perceived and imagined vision of what 'love' is and what it is capable of accomplishing, to somehow find himself at a point where he believes the feelings of, or capacity for, this perception of 'love', have abandoned him. all of a sudden he finds himself closed off from certain emotional bonds and elements of companionship that he will never know. he is forced to reevaluate his position and stance and beliefs on something that is part of him, the one thing that was 'supposed to be' unwavering, the sole thing that he has depended on his entire life. gone. and once you arrive to that state and find yourself in that position, you begin to wonder what reasons there are for enthusiasm, for passion, for caring, for empathy...you begin to wonder what reason is there for life itself...what reason remains to live? after all, in the past, they were always based on 'love.' even if he has never known it in the form he has always imagined it, it is the simple hope and belief that it exists that has kept him going thus far. and once that abandons you, once that hope, belief, or passionate possibility is no longer evident, what else is there? all of a sudden everyone and everything just seem so empty, and the emptier they become, the deader he becomes. he is alone, he is lonely, and he knows that he always will be. now he's not the type to go and do something drastic upon coming to terms with this realization (taking his own life). not a chance. but, where does he go from here...

      unfortunately, i just don't feel like i can depend on another person to satisfy me. i will alwayz be skeptical as to their intentions and jealous of their inevitable desires. and thatz not to say i'm putting myself above anyone.   quite the contrary. for i know no one ought to depend on me.

      It's actually quite sad.  Everyone is just scared.  Afraid. So they try NOT to be friendly.  Even when I try to be friendly, A little part of me still can't help but feel guilty.  Thus is the state of L.A.
