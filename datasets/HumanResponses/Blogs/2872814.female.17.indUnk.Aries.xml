      i got bored at work to day and i had a length of till roll so i wrote on it... and now im gonna post what i wrote because im weird!  "Wow aren't till rolls useful! They come in handy for writing random crap on. This is good for me as i write and talk adn type a lot of crap everyday. Most of it makes sense to me but is lost on everyone else. However, Nick, one of my friends, understands quite a lot of my crap... As does Ben. Who used to be my boyfriend but I broke up with him coz he was annoying me and I was getting down and depressed by being with him. Now, however, I miss him. I miss beign able to talk to him like I could before, I miss being able to hug him when I want to, I miss being able to stand next to him and put my arm around him and lean my head on his shoulder. All very stupid stuff to miss. Especially as I have Phil to hug and lean on and stuff. It's all very weird. Or maybe it's just me that's screwed up. La La La... I'm bored, Sainsburys SUCK!!"  isnt that just fabulous. its just more of my random thoughts but as this is what this page is i decided to put it on here.... all makes sense in my world... and i havent spoken to my b/f much this weekend so im :( the only thing ive managed to get out of him is that hes ill and throwing up blood and stuff. which is just very concerning. and its even more concerning when i only get 2 replies and then no more, its really weird just not knowing how he is and stuff. hope hes ok.... im sure ill find out at some point... i hope... oh well enough of my crap for now... la la la.

      i have some advice for any one out there who breaks up with some one - never go and look at entrys they make on web sites unless you truly know that youre over them and it was the right thing to do. it really fucks with you if you dont know and then go read something that tells you that they are totally over you and have forgotten about you. it really sucks. in fact the best thing to do is just stay single, dont get close to people and then you cant get hurt, that makes it even more simple. be friends with people but never get too close. dont give your heart away coz itll just break. or youll break someone elses. or think that you have and then figure out its actually yours thats broken. and never assume itll all work out ok, it wont, something will go wrong and fuck up your life completely. itll make you feel like shit and, if your like me, itll send you to places which you dont wanna be and make you feel even worse about yourself. i think i might just block everyone out. refuse to feel anything for anyone and that way you cant ever get hurt or let down or get disappointed. no feelings, no pain. sounds like heaven to me. ignore your pain and itll go away. this doesnt work very well but itll stop you from breaking. also, whatever anyone says, you never loose the urge to do it again. no matter how long its been you still want to do it so you know that somewhere in you theres something thats keeping you alive. youre not just this shell that can only feel pain and confusion and hurt. you can do other things which hurt, but not in the same way. there are more than 4 feelings in the world. you can hate yourself for all youve done and carry it round forever. everyone else will forgive you but you wont be able to forgive yourself. youll always see that you could have done it differently and worked it out in different way to make it all better and happy and full of joy instead of dark and horrible and depressing. itll mess with your head totally. "tell me you dont drag that blade across your skin and pray for the courage to press down" and you know what, i cant. i need the courage coz then it wont matter what anyone wrote or writes ever again coz i wont find out adn then i wont feel as shit as i do right now. dont give your all, dont even give a bit, keep yourself away from giving anything coz itll all end in heartbreak eventually.

      Well, today was fun, I went to college and failed a math exam, woohoo!!!! Whatever you do, DO NOT take math at AS level, it sucks majorly and none of it makes any sense! Anywayz... This is gonna be a proper blog coz I havent written much about me that makes any kind of sense for quite a while! At the moment Im happy.. ish... I took a few steps backwards in my life recently but it felt good, and this is not a real good thing coz the steps backwards were bad ones. But I feel alive again and happy to know that the safety net still works. However, the safety net shouldnt be there, its not the good sort of net, its the kind that makes people get mad at you and scream at you for beign stupid. Im sure some people know what Im going on about, and if you dont then just ignore me... Anyway.... Back to something good! Ive been going out with my b/f for 1 month today, hurray!!!! Im very tired at the moment but thats coz I keep not going to bed till pretty late and then texting my b/f when Im in bed and then waking up lots in the night and not being able to get back to sleep again. Its not so good.  I keep listening to songs with kinda not good sounding names... Toxic, Poison, Addicted, Here Without You, Your Revolution Is A Joke..... All very good songs but they dont sound very happy from the titles, lol, i like them though!!!! OoO, my b/f will be in uniform tonight...... God dammit why cant i see him?! Men in uniform is so fun ^-^ I think I may be a bit odd... But the uniform thing is good!!!! Thinking about it. its more just a god dammit why cant i see my b/f.... Not being at college is an evil thing! And its friday tomorrow.... :( Means I wont see him again til monday after Ive seen him tomorrow.... I think I might cry.... I dont even get any eye candy at work coz I changed my hours so i dont get to see Seb anymore.... God dammit!!!! No eye candy for a whole weekend!!!! Have to make the most of seeing my b/f tomorrow.... Hum..... That could be fun ;) (But dont get your hopes up babe, public place remember!! :p)  Evanescence are so good.... I totally love My Immortal.... And Amy Lee is very cute :) I was watching Cabaret earlier and theres this line that goes "You're about at fatale as an after dinner mint" Made me laugh anyway.... I love getting quotes from movies.... And I just love movies.... Watched Pirates Of The Carribean a couple of days ago, such a good film, if you havent seen it go rent it and watch!!!!! For the guys theres Kiera Knightly and sword fighting and for the girls theres Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and a love story!!!! Oh, and its a comedy and drama all in one! Its a very fantastic film, as you may be able to tell I LOVE IT!!!!!!! I also love books very much. Im trying to read the top 100 from the BBC Big Read programme but Im not getting very far! Ive read a few but I keep getting distracted by other books I wanna read!!! And by watching stuff and just twating around doing not alot, lol!  This hasnt really turned into an instalment of my amazing life, but more of a me rambling on about nothing, lol. See how easily I am distracted from my goal?!!!! Its a wonder I get anything done at all! "Romeo and Ethel The Pirates Daughter... Its a working title" lol, Shakespeare In Love is a good film!!! And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Feinnes look very nice in it, lol!!  I will stop my rambling eventually.... I amy even make a point right at the end.... But I very much doubt it.... But I might so youll ahev to keep reading to find out, MHA HA HA HA HA.... Good Afternoon, Im Crazy, Who are you?! La La La... I like glow sticks.....  OK.... have to put a happier song on... My Immortal is making me feel a bit down... Its not good....  Changed it to Summer Of '69, I love this song so much!!!!! Bryan Adams RULES!!!!! As do Placebo, yay them!!!! I like lots of music... And lots of different music... Steps, Staind, Blink 182, Busted, Alice Cooper, ABBA, Linkin Park, LIT, P!NK, Placebo.... Even the Spice Girls, I can see youre shocked!!! But I was listenign to Viva Forever the other day and OMG I love that song, Lady is A Vamp is also very good!!!! I think I need to find the point I was trying to make rather than keep rambling....  OoO, I cant think of the point but, Phil, the answer to the question you asked me earlier is yes, you did... All makes sense if he can remember the question.... However, you people will be left to wonder, MHA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!  Doop di doo..... You may be wondering what sort of person I am.... Well, Im me, Im kinda crazy, a little warped, kinda gothy but not totally, I like corsets, I like salt and vinegar crisps - shame on you if you dont like them!!!!! And I like being with people, talking, horse riding, reading, films, being weird, hanging round parks - Easthill last summer was V fun!!! I have good memories - thank you to a lot of people, and also sorry to one person who will be in some very good memories but wont make any more that good. I think Im gettign a bit sentemental now so Ill leave that topic..... What else to say.... La la la..... I dunno really.....   I didnt do much in my math exam today but I did get to write some more poem type things which I feel like sharing with you so woohoo, arent you people so lucky?!!! Oh well, here goes...  Bind me, blind me, scar my skin Beat me, hurt me, you'll never win Try me, mind me, choose my sin mock me, hate me, I won't let you win Lead me, keep me, take me in Bleed me, chain me, you still won't win.                  *********  You made these scars upon me And those I cannot hide But one scar I feel within me Will never be seen outside This scar I have is in my heart I can feel it everyday Every waking minute Whether you're here or far away.          ************  Can you give me all my faith back? Will you be the one to heal? When I'm calling for my saviour Will you be the one who hears? Can I ask you all my questions? Are you going to set me free? Will I bow down on my knees for you? Am I going to be renewed?   And thats all for this instalment as I have to go eat dinner!!! Be prepared for more excitement next time.... Not very likely to be that exciting but oh well, you can hope!!!

      this is my world, my rules you cant make me do things you cant change the way i am. i do things my way all that stuff is mine you wont change me no one else has ever managed theres nothing to define you from all the hopeless others. destroying my way will be treason i wont give up my blade. it gives me a place to fall back on when nothing else is real. it gives me a way to feel again when all else makes me numb. ill cut off my wings before you turn me, ill take it all and dive. no one can take me away from me i refuse to be made different i wont let you take me away.

      I wrote this for my b/f last night so im gonna post it coz i feel like it!  Wishing you could be with me now, I can feel you here. Your warm body pressed against mine, Our legs intertwined. I can feel your breath upon my neck, Feel your hand upon my thigh. I remember the way you kiss me And I can feel you do that too. The way you make me feel alive Everytime you make me smile. I can feels your arms around me, Feel you move to cover me. I can feel you take me higher, I rise and ride up high. Without you even being here I can feel you deep inside.  i know its kinda crap but, meh, tough crap!  thats the way the cookie crumbles!  lol, bruce almighty rules!!!!

      When will this all stop? The mess inside my head Is bringing me down, Dragging me into depression, Beyond my prince's reach. Down here he cannot save me, I am lost inside a castle. One without real walls. There is a dungeon And here I am chained Without a light or hope...

      today i feel crap. im bored of writing about damn farming and my mums always going on bout how i need to do more work and get better grades and try harder but i just cant be bothered anymore. at the moment i feel like theres no point. i dunno whats made me go like this again, i did it before and i just wanted to give up. nothings worth fighting for anymore, theres nothing that can make me wanna get up in the morning and try to get into a better frame of mind and get on with living. everythings just getting me down, i dunno, its just really weird. nothing seems to matter and i dont feel like i care about much anymore, its really scary. stuff could be happening around me and i dont know if id react at all. its like someones put me in this little box and i can see that theres good stuff and it seems like i could get it but i try and i cant, and now im gonna give up trying coz i dont think ill ever get it. i dont wanna go to work today coz i dont have the energy to be nice to people but i have to. i wanna go and do something fun but theres nothing to do, all my friends are at work on saturdays, on sunday mornings i work and nothing goes on anyway, and then the rest of the week we have college, its like theres no time to just be us and do nothing, except after college and then not everyones there. and if we sit in the common room at school we end up getting kicked out eventually and we have no other place to go coz its february and its freezing outside and noone ever has free house and rents are just plain evil. and everythings changing so fast. its hasnt even been a month since i broke up with my last b/f and both of us are going out with different people now. its so weird. sometimes i see him and i just think, what went wrong? why did it go wrong? why does everything have to change? and its really weird, coz i know that i had to break up with ben coz i was just getting down and everything was getting kinda weird. i dunno, everythings just kinda screwed up in my head. as usual. all my friends seem to be dealing with it all so much better and im just like, hey wait for me, whats the secret to being happy and coping with all this? and theres no where to get any answers from and my mum always tells me off for not talking to her and telling her whats wrong with me but i just cant do that, im so crap at talking to people and telling them whats wrong. i can write all the stuff i want but i just cant say any of it. and ill proabably get told off for not doing my essay and writing this but right now i dont really care, i feel like i have to do this so i can do my essay and get myself in a fit state to go and work. sitting for four hours on a till in sainsburys is just about the crapest job you can get, you have to be nice to people the whole time and i hate being nice all the time, i get told off for looking miserable but i cant really help it if i feel like complete shit. and then i get to go and do it again for four hours tomoro morning, how fucking fun? i dont want to be like this any more, something seriously has to give. i just dont know what its gonna be... ill just have to hope its not gonna be my will power. i already have enough scars, i dont need any more. and now i feel drained from writing this load of crap, its so stupid.  one last go anyone? im sure it wont hurt...

      wow, today was fun! its v cold outside and i asked people to go to the park and i went and no-one was there. so i waited and my b/f turned up and we were cold and then one of my mates turned up and we walked down to see one of my other mates at work. this was a gd idea coz a) it was warm inside and b) seeing people is gd. however i was kinda annoyed coz other ppl went to someones house but oh well, their loss in my view! so we sat and did not alot, talked a bit, my b/f got pissed off at me coz i flirt with my mates (not all of them just a few of them, i have weird relationships with them ok?! and also i havent been able to flirt for AGES coz of my last b/f, all makes sense to me) but my current b/f isnt too thrilled with me flirting with ppl even if it doesnt really mean anything, its just fun, ok???? i have fun, they have fun, as far as i know no-one loses anything and nothing bad happens (except the b/f getting in a bad mood but im sure hell get over it) and its just me, i enjoy being like that with ppl, makes life more fun, you dont get bored. anywayz.... im also in a bad mood coz im on and im horny, not a gd combo i can tell u!!! argh, life as a girl sucks!!!!! oh, and im still ill, colds are evil! although at the mo i am having an interesting convo bout threesomes... sounds pretty gd, lol bet some ppl will be glad to hear that!! i have exams next week and i really dont wanna do them, blatently gonna fail them unless i do a load of revision and at the mo i cant be bothered to so oh well, and ill probably get told that not being bothered is no excuse but oh well, shame. and i will stop ranting eventually...  i feel better at the mo actually, writing stuff down is so helpful, lol. anywayz... gonna finish with a poem just because i can :P   I'm just another fake, a mystery, a decoy. You fooled for it again and now you're all alone. There was no brighter day in store All those promises were lies. Time will be no healer, forever you will hurt Becasue you fell for a phoney. I'm not your solution, salvation. I'm just another placebo, To make you call and beg for MORE...

      Daylight pours through an open window And spills across your face. The face of an angel stares up at me, Though your eyes are shut up tight. I watch you sleeping 'cos you look so beautiful, My very own living dream. The white sheets are crumpled, legs intertwined. A memory of the night we had. You start to stir, and draw me in closer This embrace I don't want to end. I breath you in, soak you into my skin You scar my skin with sweat. But these scars I don't want to hide, I'll show you off with pride.   I appologise for the random poems being posted but I just felt like it. ok?!!! and Phil, im sorry, ill try not to be such a bitch in future... ill wait til youve gone before i start flirting :P only kidding, anywayz... sorry babexxx and thats the end of the personal msgs...

      I'm sorry I ever let him touch, Let him feel my skin I'm sorry I ever let him near me Allowed him to share this sin. Just remembering makes me angry It fills me up inside Until I can't take it any more And scream within my mind I want, need, all my answers To stop me from melting away Why did what he thought matter? Should I have stayed one more day? Would everything turn out so different If my choice had been post-poned Or would it have got me down further And begging for life to be freed I can't hold this in much longer I don't want to carry this pain So I stand before you, a new girl, Who'll never be caught by your chain.

      She screams then he closes his eyes No matter how loudly, how piercing she screams He won't open his eyes to the day The sight that would be infront of his eyes Shatters the illusion he makes He sees what he wants to see, deep in his mind Pretends everything will be OK He can't face the reality she goes through everyday So, as she screams, he closes his eyes And focuses on the dream.  This twisted illusion, a cruel twist of fate He can't face this life alone She pushes them through, struggles and screams While he wanders blind.  He stumbles forward, tripping on lies Falling then crawling up on to his knees Keeping eyes closed, refusing to believe She has to keep pushing, on to the end The darkness engulfs them She believes this will end for her That the pain will die, end this grief They can't go on anymore, one day it has to end He doesn't see this through all of the pain So they stumble on and can't break free.  This twisted illusion, a cruel twist of fate He can't face this alone She pushes them through, struggles and screams While he wanders blind.  They stand on the threshold of life and death She falls and collapses to the floor Her screaming falls silent as her life ebs away His eyes slowly open to reveal his nightmare Tears stream down, now it's his turn to scream The pain he ignored as they stumbled on Wrenches the hate from his soul The hate he remembered and the hate he forgot His memories of the worst days Nothing is left but the pain and the loss.  This twisted illusion, a cruel twist of fate He can't face this world alone She pushed them through, struggled and screamed While he wandered blind.

Sacrifice   Never did you see this saviour As she tore her wings apart, Ran to be beside you  And mend your breaking heart She gave up her place in heaven To come and change your life, Rid you of your pain, despair And end your pointless strife. She wanted you to be happy, Full of laughter and of joy But you turned your back upon her So she couldn't help this boy. All her life was lived for you, You were her only goal. She has not only lost her wings, She's lost her saving soul.   Arent you so glad you came here???  anyways... i did have soemthing to say really. im happy at the moment, a rarety for me! and so i decided to share it with all of you people.... i mean i dont actually know if anybody reads this but ill carry on typing anyway... la la la..... anyway... yes, im happy *shock, horror* but i am, woohoo! and now im even more happy coz my b/f just came online and i havent seen him or talked to him since yesterday! but im all happy with him coz ive been more honest more quickly with him than i was with mith my last b/f, i think. but i may just be a jaded happy place, but i love it so who cares!!!!!! woohoo, yay happy me!!! and im happy coz i get to go shopping for ball gown tomorrow, im so happy, yay!!!!!!

      not being able to be alone in private with your boyfriend is the most annoying thing in the world i can think of. i am very not happy bout not being able to get any time with him when no one else is round. it really annoyign me coz i wanna have some time when we can be use and not have anyone coming in and saying anything and stuff... you can probably tell im not so happy about not being able to be alone with him. i mean its just nice to be with him but theres just some stuff that cant be done in public places. well in my opinion anyway, i know theres some that wouldnt care, lol! and i just wanna spend more time with him than i can at the moment. but from friday its the easter holidays so hopefully i will have the chance to see him and stuff in private which would be really nice. god i moan alot.... or not depending on how you look at it....... its so annoying coz soemtimes im like, if we were somewhere else i know that stuff would happen and i want it to. argh, frustration is so icky! i hate being a teenager with protective parents. i know theyre only doing what they thinks right but sometimes i feel like i want a little bit more freedom to go out and have fun and stuff. i think thats my moan over with for now. damn it, i wanna see him *cry* how long til 10:10 tomoro morning?...

      "It's all I want right now, to love (her) like I loved Sarah. She deserves it, more than Sarah ever did."  this is part of an entry in a guys journal. i edited it slighty coz im being nice although most people can probably fill in the missing word. i read this yesterday and it really does hurt. i know that the person who wrote this has ever reason to hate me and want to hurt me really badly but can any one answer me this : how can someone deserve love more than another? ive been trying to figure it out and so far the only solution ive come up with is that im a total bitch who doesnt derserve anything from any one and that is, quite possibly, the truth. it doesnt stop it really really hurting though. it has also completely changed my opinion of the author. hes probably just beign honest, which is a good thing, but he knows i read his journal and therefore he knows i would see that. i dont know if he reads this but if you do, know that youve got me back now, you can stop being horrible to me, you can stop bitching about me with Ev, stop worrying about me, stop thinking about me, stop talking to me and just leave me to get on with life without you. i know that you dont think i should be with phil, i know you dont think were good together but quite honestly does it matter to you? im happy so could you just leave me alone? i know im being bitchy and you can hate me all you like but i just want to move on, get over this and try to get on with what ive got now. i have had enough of people thinking they know what i need to do to make my life better, maybe you do but right now im having a great time screwing stuff up for myself and attempting to pick up the pieces and get on with it. i have also had enough of being a girl. i want to curl up and go to sleep for a few days so that i wont have to be awake to have backache etc but no, that would be far too kind. and i have to had coursework in anyway... i think ive finished ranting now. cant think of anyone else whos pissed me off enough for me to rant and rave on here.  i hope you're happy now, coz you know i hate you all the things we used to do have faded now to memories cant be bothered to give a damn about you or your new life go out, get high, have fun, live dont care what your doing im happy moving on, getting over you is the best thing i ever did dont really want to hurt you but i hate the things you said dont believe in covering with lies ill just tell it how it is.              *****  hope your happy journal writer you made me bleed again all the times you did it before and this one now makes ten dont want to make you worry coz i feel hate for you now hope you can get over this take your final bow goodbye journal writer you made this girl a fighter.

      "Do you remember when we talked for hours on end Just being stupid but at least we didn't pretend Your smile helped me to find my way Who's listening now? Why won't you Find me and show me What do you want from me? There's gotta be better than this I don't wanna leave you But baby I need to There's gotta be better than this Or we'll never know"  just figured out that i totally get this song. may not make sense to anyone who reads this but i know what im talking about. college is very boring today, nothing to do and the lessons i had were pretty shite. math is a crap subject and none of it makes sense, dont even contemplate learning it for any longer than you absolutely have to. and business studies is ok but we got the case study for the exams today so the teachers are starting to put on the pressure and keep telling us how little time we have til our exams and how important they are for the rest of our lives. im sure they only do it coz they care but it gets pretty boring and annoying after the 50th time. its the same kinda speech they made at the time of the gcses only now theyve decided to do it more and make it even more boring. i attempted some math homework last night and used the formula that wed been told and that was printed in the text book but the answers are still wrong. very annoying, made me seriously pissed off and i did actually end up throwing the math text book across the room, not such a good idea but it did make me feel better. been listening to quite heavy music for me because of my shit mood and im quite possibly permenantly damaging my hearing from having it loud but right this second i dont really care. my headphones are kinda screwed up though and i think the right one is louder than the left but oh well, ill just have to buy some new ones once ive got paid. only about two weeks to go. my bedroom is pissing me off coz its too small and no matter how much i tidy up and throw stuff away i never seem to have any more space. and i can never find anything that i want to find in there. which may suggest that it isnt tidy but i keep tidying up and putting stuff away and in boxes etc but it doesnt work. i think my room just moves stuff round when im not there. people (teachers mainly) keep telling me all this work i have to do so that the exams go ok and i just cant be bothered at the moment. i have two pieces of coursework to do that i have to hand in on friday, an essay for tomorrow, a set of chem questions for tomorrow, chem questions for friday and some business studies for god knows when. and i really cannot be bothered to get all my stuff together and get on and do it. but i have to cause if i dont do the english essay im gonna be locked out of the class, if i dont hand the coursework in i fail my AS level and the other bits i ahev to do coz otherwise i get yelled at by teachers and my parents and quite possibly some of my friends will look at me or say something. one person in particular but im not gonna say anything else cos ill quite possibly regret it. anyways... apart from all of this shit, lifes ok. kinda... apart form the fact that i havent seen my b/f today and i dont actually have any idea where he is or anything. but one of my mates said that my b/f told him to hug me from him. not sure if thats worded correctly but makes sense to me. anywayz... yea, lifes kinda shit but oh well, im sure ill get over it. most people do. nothing else much to say. going back to the boredom that is free lessons in college. later.

       Help   Help, Can anybody hear me? I may sound pathetic But I know I can be strong. The pain that I’m inflicting Don’t you see, It’s a cry for help I don’t want to hurt you I don’t want to be mean I want you to help me So I can become clean. The dirty drugs that are in my veins They make me do these things Make me say the hateful words That in the morning I regret. I can’t help who I am I can’t help what I may be But I know that I can change With a little help from you. Please don’t back away from me Please don’t turn and run. I don’t remember what I said I don’t remember what I did. You have to tell me all the things Every single little detail. I can’t remember who I am So help me before I’m gone. Teach me everything you know Then ask me how I cry. What I hate about the world And why I want the gun. Don’t give me the things I ask for Don’t help me with the drugs Just tell me no And help me pass this test. I know that I can do it With you by my side If you give love I will give them up for you. I won’t try and kill you I won’t shout anymore Just help me kick this habit Before I kick you out the door…     Release   It makes me feel alive To see the bright red Trickle down my arm. It hurts but shows me I can still feel Even though I think I can’t go on. It releases some of the anger, The frustration I feel inside. When someone tells you To slash your wrists It makes you think, Maybe I should. And when it’s someone You love and trust, It cuts you deeper. Cuts you deeper, I cut deeper Until I cut the vein. This time I’ve gone further, This time I’ll die. It’s a release, A final release As I slump in a heap on the floor. I took his advice, I did it.    as you can probably tell, not in such a good mood. dunno why just feel crap. went horse riding this morning. ben (the pony) was being naughty, cant really blame him it was really winding and horrible. but he was being a little sod. kept trying to trot/canter when we were meant to be walking. did manage to sort of control him eventually. made my arms ache though. then i got to go to work, happy fucking joy. i hate sainsburys, i really do. sitting on a till is so mind numbingly boring. i really do hate my job. probably as most other people do but meh, im having a moan about me and how my life sucks. i dunno what i want any more. my mind getting all weird again. think i have to shut up and stop thinking and contemplating anything. maybe turning off is the answer.... wonder how to turn the mind off... i spose death would turn it off, maybe thats the answer.

      life is shit. after my amazing happiness yesterday i am now completely fucking miserable. and for no apparent reason. well apart from the usual life sucks, college is shit etc etc. my b/f is not talkign to me at the mo and i dont actually know why. (by at the moment i do actually mean right now, coz im at college beign bored shitless) i dont really hav any reason to be here and i probably should go home coz its my mums birthday but if i go home in this mood itll just be so miserable and itll probably ruin her day. like i normally do. wont be any difference in that part of my life. wow how amazingly great beign a teenager is. fucking hell i hope it gets better. if it doesnt i think i may start taking up dangerous sports in the hopes that ill hav an accident, how fun? and anyone that reads this is gonna get pissed off at me being miserable etc and for generally moaning a lot. i think i am just a complete bitch. oh well, maybe one day itll all be fine and beign a bitch will get me somewhere. until then i guess ill just accept the general hating thing

      this is something i wrote on another journal and now ive decided to post it on this one coz i dont think anyone actually reads the other one and i think people should read stuff... even if it is complete crap... oh well, im fucked up so here goes... "and i have some advice - if someones beginning to piss you off, tell them before it gets to a point of no return. even if theyre only irritating you a bit tell them and try to sort it out. if you dont you may end up loosing something you really dont want to loose. i fucked up majorly on that point. also, karma does work, you fuck with people and you end up being fucked with yourself. the world is a screwed up place and people make it even more so. no one should tell you what to do or when to do it. do what you want to, listen to advice on the way and then make your own desicions. if someone tells you to do something you dont like, tell them. dont let people push you around. dont let anyone rule your life except you. and if you slash up your arms like me, get help." fin.

      this is gonna be a bit of a poem hit which is gonna confuse, annoy and screw up quite a lot of people but im a weird screwed up freak so im gonna go with the publishing anyway.  You made me scar my skin And you scarred my heart. Can't you see I still love you? I've made a mistake again Telling you I don't need you, Making you believe it's over. Trying to love another. And all the time thinking of you. This feeling I can't remove from here It's stuck around my heart. Will we ever be over? Will we both be free? My chains are still locked by you. Only you have my key.  ********  This is what I've done for you, I've changed for your desires. Left behind all that you hate And drawn a new outline. Turned away from my old friends, Given up all you despised. The lines still show But they're fading now. It's waht I've done for you. Lost my only escape. Got rid of my past love affair, My double bladed knife.  ********  Your laughter makes my blood run cold, It cuts my skin and breaks my heart. My mind plays back everyday How it used to be us two. But I gave up my place beside you And moved to give me hope. Now I sit at night and wonder If it all just died without you.   and there are lots of people who are now probably very confused and annoyed and pissed off at me. sorry to those people, you know who you are. sorry, always sorry.

      what to say.... i know i need to get some of the stuff from my head and onto paper/screen but its hard to know where to start... *sigh*  ok.. ben, youre right i did cut again and not just the time you know about, ive done it twice more since then and it still feels the same which is not a good thing. although i spose it has changed coz the last time i did it i wanted to see blood. it wasnt just about hurting it was about seeing myself bleeding. its very odd. and phil, i cant promise that i wont do it again, i wont even try to tell you that i wont coz quite honestly i never know myself if im gonna or whats gonna set me off to want to cut again. if i knew id steer clear of all triggers and then i would quite happily promise that i would never do it again. im sorry im hurting people through doing this and through just being me and being indecisive/regretful etc.  i appologise for my ranting on here and for being a general bitch when i hear things i dont like. i get wound up and when people begin to say stuff about how great stuff was before i get lost in memories and then i dont want to come back again. and that sounds really horrible to everyone i know now and to phil. sorry.  being with phil is so different from being with ben. i mean, i know theyre totally different people but the actual relationship is different. i think it went alot slower with ben but that may have been coz it was the first kinda proper relationship i had. also, i spent more time with ben just being us two without other people being round. i only see phil at college and then theres always other people around and you cant just totally relax and yea im gonna shut up.... with ben i saw him pretty much everyday at school and then he normally came over to mine. and coz we started going out in the summer we saw each other pretty much all day everyday for ages. i really like beign with phil but theres something in me that makes me wonder what hes looking for. and that people have said that we dont suit each other and that hes a very sexual person but i dunno coz i havent know him for a really long time and i dont really know many people that have. and i appologise to you now babe, but im just having a weird time trying to get everything out and be honest with this wonderful machine infront of me in the hopes that maybe, just maybe itll all make sense in my head after ive finished writing. sorry.  its all very different with phil. and hes a lot more open than i am. i think im quite shy and i keep stuff to myself, i dont like broadcasting the state of my love life or any other part of my life really. i can joke about it and shit but i cant actually talk seriously with many people. theres probably one or two people i can talk to seriously bout it and they, most likely, know who they are. i think there are gonna be alot of appologies in this blog. and here comes another, im sorry im not more open and willing to talk to people bout myself. if i could it would probably be a lot easier to get on with me and not get annoyed at me and realise taht when i done say something it may not have anything to do with the person im talking to its just me.  i think im finally running out of things to rant about. and i feel a lot better. im very sorry to anyone who reads thsi and gets offended or hurt or anything else bad from what ive written. i dont want to hurt anyone anymore but i most probably will. sorry yet again.

      i think the word im looking for is opps. kinda didnt tell my b/f about organizing to go see InMe when they come down here and i think he may be a little annoyed at me. see, theres this group of guys going and my best mate wanted to go but she didnt really wanna go with just the guys, so she asked me if i wanted to go coz she knows i like InMe. it totally went out of my mind when i saw my b/f coz i was just happy to see him, you know?! and i sort fo fogot about saying anything to him and from his blog i think he may be a little annoyed. and i cant really do anything bout it at the mo coz hes at cadets so even if i text him he wont get it yet.... might text him to say sorry tho... would be a good idea, yes, i think ill do that... anyway, opps! i dont think im very good at being a g/f yet, need more practice me thinks... hum... oh well, hopefully ill get it (as long as cadet boy doesnt hate me now... oh that would be really bad... i think ill shut up and stop thinking about him hating me now, its making me all fell really horrible) anyway, go text him sarah... yes, im gonna go now and text him and stuff.... look out for further updates... hopefully it will get better and maybe he could come too.... ah, an idea for a bday pressie for him, wow! ticket to the InMe gig the day before his birthday.... that sounds like a good idea.... may have to try that.... wow, my brain is still working, amazing!!! anyway, im gonna try and sort this out...

      looking at a blank screen knowing you want to write stuff and not being able to figure out how to type it is really horrible.  i spose the first thing i should do is appologise. say sorry to cadet boy for me being such a weird ass freak. i wasnt in a mood with you today, i was just in a mood coz people were being so horrible, and i know i was laughing and stuff but i was only doing that coz if i didnt i wouldve probably cried. yea, i was having a laugh with rez but he really doesnt know when to quit it. he really pissed me off in the end, and i went outside coz people inside were being horrible only to be insulted by the people outside and then attacked by rez again. its not so good. i get pissed off like that sometimes. i walked away from you when you were in the private study room and just mumbled at me coz i couldnt be bothered to try and get you to talk to me when you seemed to be in such a mood. sometimes i do this thing called assume people dont want to talk. i have issues with saying i love you because sometimes i dont know how i feel and i dont want to say it to you and then decide i dont mean it. i dont want to hurt you.  i dont really know what else to say. apart from dont even be thinking about the whole suicide idea, ill kill you if you even think it again! but seriously, no suicide, and thats a rule i want all my friends to follow. no suicide, no self-harm, no hurting people intentionally. talk instead. it does wonders, im sure there are loads of people thatll tell you that. and if you cant talk type, or write. just dont resort to drastic measures, you end up with ugly scars, painful memories and loads of regrets. its not worth it in the long run, and remember that bt add, "its good to talk" well, it really is so go ahead and try.  on a lighter note, i really like the maroon 5 album. borrowed it from my friend KT aka kit kat aka my lesbian lover, lol!!!! and no guys you still cannot get free porn from us!!!!! even if we know you, you have to pay like all the others, teeheehee!!!! anyways, the album is really good! me loves it!!!!  im sure i had more sensible and profound stuff to say but i went off on a tangent and now its gone.... my english teacher of the last 4 years is leaving in the summer :( im not happy cos hes the greatest teahcer on earth!!!! any people in manchester who are getting a new english teacher by the name of Mr Matthew Lynch are the luckiest people alive!!! hes fantastic and im really gonna miss him when he leaves! um... my shoulders getting better after the incident with the pony. its still not 100% but its a hell of a lot better, i no longer have to take pills every 5 hours! this can only be a good thing! got a new computer, its black and really nice and all fast and has pretty lights on the front, im well impressed! and this is the first time ive actually been able to use it for more than about 5 minutes coz i havent had chance to, lol!!! but its great and i love it! got a full length purple skirt to go with my corset for the ball. its really pretty (but im gonna be biased) and i got a necklace and earrings so i think i nearly have my whole outfit, yay!!!! its v exciting!  i just figured out one of the other more sensible things i was gonna say, im beginning to feel a bit weird coz next tuesday would have been my one year anniversary with ben. i know its weird but i still feel kinda weird about it. guess im just gonna have to take it as it comes. *sigh* oh well, hopefully it wont be too bad. and now im gonna go coz ive written enough crap for now and i have to go eat my dinner anyway.  sorry to lots of people who may or may not have been hurt or offended or anything else by this post. i appologise most profusly (and im sorry i cant spell) sorry.  "look for the girl with the broken smile, ask her if she wants to stay a while and she will be loved, she will be loved..." ~ maroon 5 - she will be loved.

       RIP   I sit in the dark and cry my heart out Take a blade and slash and cut But it is blunt So cuts me not. I can’t even commit suicide Nothing in my life is right. I cannot love I cannot hate I cannot feel at all My soul has gone, never to return And my heart has ceased to beat. Finally I’ve given up, My fight is over.  *****   Broken   I don’t think I can keep my promise anymore. I can’t get by without it, I need the release from my life. When it all gets too much It’s the only thing that can help. I get the familiar blade And the memories come flooding back. How I once went too far And ended up in casualty, Saying it was an accident. How, after that, You made me promise, Swear I wouldn’t do it again. But now my promise is broken, I can’t keep it anymore.  *****   You Tell Me…   You tell me you love me Then you knock me to the ground. You tell me that you care for me Then hit me even harder. You tell me that you want me Then lock me out of our house. You tell me that you trust me Then keep all your secrets to yourself. You tell me that you only want me Then pay another woman. You tell me that you’ll be gentle Then cause me all that pain. You tell me you won’t do it again Then the next night you rape me. You tell me that you’ll change How many times have I heard that before?    i feel like shit. my b/f was meant to come over today but i went shopping with my sister so i text him and said can you come over later. i got no reply coz, as usual, he has no credit. and when i got back i text him saying i was home and he could come over. again, no reply - hardly suprising - but he didnt come over either. so he could be dead in some ditch and i wouldnt know. isnt life just fucking great?

      poem hit...  He pushed open the door slowly Afraid of what he might find. She was curled in a corner, Her back to a wall Clawing at the skin on her arms. ‘Oh god, what did he do?’ As much to himself as to her. “I have to be clean, Get this tainted skin off me” She cried as she scratched at her surface. The tears that snaked down to the floor Left trails of black on her face. Her fingers streaked blood As she tried to get ‘clean’ He walked forward and crouched by her side. ‘Stop. It’s not getting you clean, You’re just hurting yourself more.’ “But I have to get him off me, Get rid of his foul scent” She looked up at him, Her eyes wide and scared. “He’s made me dirty, Ruined all my carefulness. What am I going to do?” For this he had no answer And just looked as he started to cry. ‘You’re going to be fine’ He said as he took her hands, ‘No more trying to get clean, We have to stop this blood’ “Stop the blood” she repeated “How will that help me get clean?” “I can’t live this way, I’ve got to end the unclean, It can’t stay here on me.” He sighed as she tried To begin her ‘cleaning’ again. ‘No, this isn’t the way, Stop, you have to stop, I’ll make everything OK’ She caught his eye, Believed the false promise. “Everything… Ok… Please take me home” She cried more and more As he wrapped round a towel That slowly turned red with her blood. “ I love you… and I’m sorry… For not believing” She gasped her last breath And her eyes glazed like ice. ‘Goodbye my sweet baby, Just wait for me there’ He sank to his knees in despair, Cried to the great being Who’s somewhere out there, ‘Why her? Why now? You stole my only love’ ‘How can I believe in you…?’  *****   Edward Scissorhands   High in the tower, there he sits And waits with widened eyes. The ceiling is open to the heavens. Moonlight pouring in. It glints on the metal, Shining in the dark while he cries. His eyes tell a story, One of sadness and lies. They are black and pierce Through the increasing gloom. Hands move up, fresh blood appears The tears are mixed with red. He has no way to stop this pain, There is nothing he can do. Waiting for his saviour But she has not come. The wind blows through, Chills to the bone. Her footsteps fall on listening ears. The time is yet to come. He stands and waits, Waiting for her plea. Her plea for him to set her free Let her out from this darkened prison. It does not come. Instead, she walks towards him And pleas for him to hold her. Tears stream down her face, This will be their last goodbye. She comes still nearer And manoeuvres herself to his arms. He clings to her, never wanting to forget. She holds on too, not wanting to let go. His eyes still are sad Telling the pain he feels. She cries still more but pulls away, Kisses him gently then turns. This goodbye means forever Because of his scissor hands.  *****   Deceit   You are lying to me And finally I can see it. All the false promises, The things that have never, And will never be. You have deceived me For so, so long. Other people saw through A long time ago But I refused to believe. I was so naïve, You wouldn’t lie to me, We were soul mates. Now everything is different The deceit has gone The real you stands before me. You are the shadow Of the man I thought you were. I can’t believe I took it in, Lapped up the lies for so long Wasted so much time All for nothing. Your cover is blown The deceit has ended.  *****   Losing You   I sit at your bedside As the tears begin to fall. They tell me that you’ve gone But still I hold your hand And refuse to let it go. I know in my heart you’ve left me So why can’t I let go? I don’t want to be on my own I can’t cope without you. The tears fall steadily Leaving shining trails down my face. You are beginning to grow cold And my hands begin to shake But my grip on you does not loosen. I can’t let you go. You are my rising sun, My falling rain, My dawn birds chorus And my winter snow. To lose all this would kill me And so I make my choice, To join you, forever.  *****   Thank You  (for SR)  Thank you for helping me When no-one else could. For showing me a better way, How I can get by Without cutting my wrists. Thank you for making me Believe in love again. You truly love me. If you didn’t, I wouldn’t be here. Thank you for understanding, For listening as I ramble on, Not judging me because of what I did. Thank you for being my friend. When no-one else was good enough You shone through the dark. Thank you for believing in me. And, when I needed it the most, Thank you for loving me.

      msn messenger is a whore. gone down again so i have no contact with the outside world.... not that there would be many people to talk to knowing my luck... and my b/f could be dead for all i know (again) coz hes still not back on the net as far as i know and he still doesnt have any credit. *sigh* life sucks.  im bored, therefore im posting. i have nothing to say really so im gonna post poetry. and i appologise if ive posted any of them before.     Release   It makes me feel alive To see the bright red Trickle down my arm. It hurts, but shows me,  I can still feel Even though I think I can't go on. It releases some of the anger, The frustration I feel inside. When someone tells you To slash your wrists It makes you think, Maybe I should And when it's someone You love and trust It cuts you deeper. Cuts you deeper, I cut deeper Until I cut the vein. This time I've gone further, This time I'll die. It's a release, A final release As I slump in a heap on the floor.     Death   Death crawls ever closer Life slipping slowly away Clinging with hands that have no strength Nothing can help her. She is alone with nothing. Nobody will care if she is gone. Worthless to everybody. Nobody will notice. Life without her will go on. As she draws her last breath The beauty around her Makes her think and wonder, Is it all necessary? Did she have to die?     Dreaming   Lying, silently, our bodies entwined Feeling each breath, each heartbeat Holding each other we are content There is no need to move Each life completed by the other Nothing can come between us I hear you whisper "I love you", Feel your warm breath on my neck Staying like this forever, our only goal Completely in love, Everything is perfect...  BANG  The bubble has burst Reality drenches me once more Your real words hammer in my ears, "I hate you, worthless bitch" The new bruises shine purple Next to older yellow ones Tears fall down my face You kick and punch I am helpless, worthless You have convinved me, I am nothing but a punchbag for you...

      "im here without you baby but youre still on my lonely mind, i think about you baby and i dream about you all the time. im here without you baby but youre still with me in my dreams and tonight, its only you and me..."    work is very boring. sainsburys till staff should be paid a hell of a lot more for the crap work we do. would make it slightly better if we got a good wage. £3.76 an hour is not, in my opinion, very good. but sundays are better, £5.80 an hour, oOo. anyway, enough of my moaning about work, cant complain too much, they do give me some money i spose. and its better than no money. wonder if cadet boy's gonna get credit any time soon.... he should be back on line in the next couple of days so should be able to talk to him soonish. i hope. im bored. i didnt think id ever say this but its the holidays and im not glad. i think i may be sick. and i feel totally crap again. and for no reason again. isnt it great? i have no idea why the hell i get so fucking depressed so i cant do a fucking thing about it. shit or what? its really pissing me off. i have five nice new lines across my arm, theyre so pretty. and the red drips were beautiful. and i had no reason to do it. just boredom and some unknown trigger i guess. oh well, whats done is done, not a lot i can do about it now.  i miss stupid things. like they way someone used to look and laugh for no reason. the way they felt when you held them. they way they knew how to make you smile. and i hate the fact that i miss it. it was my decision, surely i shouldnt miss any of it. i should be the one shouting from the rooftops and being happy and joyful. and im not. i should be happy and glad and feel better for what i did. and i thought that i did feel better. at times i really do. i feel a hell of a lot better, not so much worry, less to think about. and then i start thinking more and i miss stupid little things. things that i could, maybe, find in someone else. but i dont want to. at times i want to go back and do it again, only different. i want to go back to before and talk. sort it out before i went crazy. and then i look at what i have now and i dont want to lose that. i know i had to lose what i had before to gain what i have now. before i had a b/f who really liked me and cared for me but was ever so slightly paranoid and began to annoy me for absolutely no reason at all. and now i have a b/f who cares for me, really likes me and is a little bit paranoid. can any one else see the similarilties? i look at it and i think and i come up with all kinds of crazy ideas that its all gonna go wrong again. i think i just have serious issues with relationships. i never expect them to last very long and then when they do i get scared im gonna lose everything. and i end up throwing it away in the end anyway. doesnt really give a lot of hope does it? and people reading this are gonna think im some sort of crazed psycho for throwing it all away the first time and thinking that its all gonna go wrong again. maybe im the one who's paranoid... or maybe my life just doesnt seem like enough to care about. i think i have to raise my opinion of myself before i can actually get anywhere. maybe thats what my problem. believing im not worth anything. i think that anyone who loves me or attempts to is completely crazy and shouldnt even bother. i only ever cause people pain. whatever happiness i can manage to instill is rapidly replaced but some kind of pain. whether it be emotional or physical or whatever. i can screw stuff up pretty well. if they gave out medals i like to think that i would be in the running for getting one for screwing up any good situation that is placed infront of me. i write a lot of complete fucking shit. i wallow in self loathing far too much. positivity would be a much better option but i dont have the energy. its a wonder i manage to keep breathing. i am too lazy, too stupid and too fucked up to be allowed to keep living. if life was fair i would get run over by a bus or something. and there i go with the self loathing again. i really should shut the hell up.  hate myself, want to die, one more shot, im going, goodbye.

      argh, parents evening!!!! and im waiting at college coz i couldnt be bothered to go home between the end of college and the start of the interview type things! and it meant i got to stay with my b/f til he left. but he left a little while ago so now im bored and blogging!!!! and i wont get to see cadet boy again til tomoro coz hes gone and i cant talk to him coz he hasnt got the net at the mo and he has no credit so i cant text him. and phoning him would be pointless coz i dont actually have anything to say to him right now  but  it would be nice to just be able to send him random crap messages!!!! spose i could still send him messages but i wouldnt get any replies.... and replies are half the fun... specially at times with my convos.... hehehe... im an angel really.... i have a halo and everything.... i keep it in the box so it doesnt get dirty, teeheehee!!!! well, i need it to be nice and clean for the times when i really need it. and i dont think it would be too good if it got tainted by my actions.... although it may be quite hard to taint it at the moment... grrr need more privacy.... hum.... holidays soon, hopefully get some at some point then... that would be good :) ahhhhh, i so should shut up!!! i really do think that i talk a load of crap on here. but then again it could all actually be an inner truth... hum... maybe its all real wisdom.... but people just dont know it yet! la la la!!! john just told me a joke... and it wasnt very funny. and apparently its not his worst, i am very worried about his source of crap jokes. surely they cant get worse than the one he just told me. but he just assured me they can... boom, boom boom. thats meant to be music type thing but it didnt work and now i have nothing else to say!!!

      i have come to the conclusion that my social life officialy sucks. i actually do nothing. dancing on mondays, work on saturday and sunday, watching footie on tuesdays. this is actually it. for the last two weeks ive been to the cinema on fridays but i dont think thats gonna last very long (what with the lack of money and all). it does actually suck. i have no evenings when i can go out coz i either have to get up for college or work. i spose fridays i could but that doesnt work coz everyone else has to get up early on saturdays to work. it is actually very crap. i spose instead of moaning on here about it i could try and change it but im too lazy to try and ive already decided in my head that nothing will help.  im so bored. i have 2 and 1/2 hours before my work shift starts. i really should be doing some revision for my exams but i just cant be bothered at the moment. im going back into one of my 2cant be fucked with the world" moments. wonder how long this one'll last? im sure my mother still hates me because what happened a while ago (her leaving coz of me) and coz of me cutting. although im not too sure i care at the moment (arent these moods just fantastic?) and i really want to cut again but i cant because i threw my blades away. plus, i have no reason to except for wanting to see blood, in my head thats enough though...  i cant really be bothered with life at the moment, i just wanna go back to bed and sleep for a few weeks... maybe ill try that, no work, no school, no seeing people. sounds quite fun, just lying in bed, listening to music, reading, writing, doing what i want to instead of having to do what other people want me to.  26 hours. sounds so long...     Notice me, take my hand Why are we strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me? Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings,I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby I make believe that you are here, It's the only way I see clear what have I done You seem to move on easy And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings, I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you baby I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry At night I pray That soon your face will fade away And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings, I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you baby  i love that song so much. means a lot to me too...      I used to bleed to feel alive To cut and feel the pain And now I've changed my reasoning, I bleed to taste the blood. To see it shining on my skin And trickled down my arm.  I feel it hot against my lips, Metallic in my mouth. I want to cut and bleed again To fulfill my craving. My vampire self is energing, Getting stronger everyday.  I hold you close and kiss your neck, Resist my urge to bite. So tantilizing before me, I want to taste your blood. And then you will be mine. This blood angel needs her fix.

      perfect ideas dont have to be right do they? just because you have this idea that something has to be a certian way it doesnt necessarily have to be like that. my ideals are so being blown out the window! *smiles* its all so fun.... teeheehee!! if youre having fun and enjoying yourself you should carry on, right? well, im having fun so its all fine!  why is it that a piece of me is always tyring to be responsible?! thinking taht maybe i shouldnt, that one day the perfect thing will come true. if this side of me keeps winning i sure hope that perfect things gonna come true soon coz OMG i really want it to!   "well, i like to take you as i find you imagine our clothes are on the floor feel my caress so soft and gentle so delicate you cry for more..."  "if you want to i can be dirty too i can spin you aroudn take up and go down if you want to i can be just like you adn do the dirty things you do"  i think i have to stop listening to savage garden and darren hayes... but im so relating to some of the songs right now!!  ahhhhhhhh so up for it!!!!! *winks and smiles*

      Blog Blog Blog Blog Blog!  I was asked if I'd updated so I am!! LOL   Don't really know what to say... Went riding on Saturday and rode Harlequin. He's lovely and so gorgeous it's unbelievable!! Really nice ride too!  Went to work on Saturday and it was boring. Went to work this morning and it was boring and busy, yuck! Had egg for my lunch, that was yummy!  I don't really know what I'm typing now, its just rubbish pretty much... Oh well!!!!  Um... Spoke to my b/f on MSN. He went shooting with the Cadets today. Sounds like fun, playing with guns....  *bites her finger while trying to think of what to write*  My keyboard's really hard to type on... And I know my typing's pretty crap but even so!  I think I'm obsessed with Maroon 5. I borrowed Songs About Jane from my b/f so I keep listening to it! I so love this album and he's I really don't wanna give it back to him! But if I don't then he'll probably keep my Blink 182 CD.... Hum.... Maybe I will give it back, just not yet!  um.... I have backache :'( It's not fair! I really want chocolate and there's none in my house, my backaches and this chair does nothing to help it AND I'm kinda horny despite not having seen my b/f for two days! And there's nothing to be done about it, I dunno about anyone else but the idea of "blood sports" has never really gone well in my head... I think I talk too much.... And write WAY too much detail in this journal!! LOL, I'm so weird.... One of the most closed up people you could meet (when it comes to anything personal (that makes sense to me)) and here I am blurting out all on the internet for crying out loud! What's wrong with me???!!!!  Well, I have to be off the net in about three minutes so I shoudl probably think about wrapping this little entry up!!  I really love www.deviantart.com it's one of the best art websites ever! I love it lots and lots!!!  Can't wait 'til tomorrow so I can see Cadet Boy :) *smiles dreamily*  Hugs are good *smile*

      sometimes i read things and they make no sense but i really want them too. no matter what i do i cant figure out what theyre supposed to mean. maybe i look too deeply and theyre not meant to mean anything at all. but then i think that everything thats written must have a meaning. prehaps my mind just doesnt work the same way as other peoples. i guess some people do write stuff that has no meaning.  i would like to put a congratulations on this blog. i dont know that congratulations is the right word but i know what i mean. this message is to someone who, i like to think, is very special to me, and who deserves to be "congratualted". i know how much effort it takes to do what you did and im so pleased for you, i hope it continues. i dont like the fact you felt like that but youve shown you have a hell of a lot more strength than me. and im proud of you. it sounds so stupid, but i am.  that will, hopefully, make sense to someone. it may well also piss someone else off but i feel i had to say it.  i hate not knowing whats going on in some peoples minds. to look at them and know theyre not ok but still have them say it is so horrible. i do it a hell of a lot but i guess we all have our flaws. i think im gonna have to make an effort to be more truthful about how i feel and then hopefully others will be more truthful with me. no matter how much it may hurt them or me.  i think thats pretty much all the dren i have for now. except for the fact that no matter how ungrateful and lost in the past i may be, i wouldnt change my present. not anymore. i like where i am in my life. i guess its just a shame i dont show it more. i also have to learn to be able to say i love you. three pretty small words that are really hard and get stuck so often. and then theres one i seem so practised at, sorry. and its how im going to end this.  sorry.

      the more i look at art, the more i hate myself. inside my head i can have all the ideas of artwork that i want but they always have to stay there. i cant draw, i cant take pictures. i have this stuff in my head which i think is a good idea, then i get so annoyed at myself if i try to draw it coz my art is actually terrible (i cant even draw proper stick men) and pictures is just not happening coz whenever i try to take good pictures they come out really crap. i hate not beign good at anything, it just keeps showing me that there really is nothing going for me. plus, my mum saw the more recent scars on my arm the other day adn now shes trying to get me to talk to her about them and i really really dont want to. i know shes worried adn stuff but i really dont want to talk to her. i dont like talking to people, i hate it. i can listen to people and give them advice but i cant talk to someone and take advice from them. i find it really hard and at the moment i really dont want to talk to anyone. i probably sound ungrateful for having someone care about me but at the moment i just want to be left alone by people. i hate people asking me if im ok, then asking me if i want to talk if i dont seem ok. if i wanted to talk, id say something, ok? im sick of watching people that i care about look so damn miserable and then look so happy. i proably do the same thing but i hate to see it. sitting in my house isnt good for me, i think too much. about the past, about the future, but hardly ever about the present. i dont think about the exams i have coming up, or about doing some revision so i pass them. i cant be bothered to. i look at pictures from a really long time ago, and then not such a long time ago. he looked so happy. and he does now, too. im glad, but it still makes me sad. i think im a very warped little girl. i dont want to grow up anymore, it keeps getting harder and i dont want it to anymore. this little girl wants to live like peter pan, a child forever, no responsibility that way. no worries, fun all day and dreams all night. the only bad thing - nightmares. not that i have them anymore. my dream catcher keeps me safe. last year i wanted to grow up, now i want to go back. i dont like getting older... and im only 17... i think ill probably be crazy by the time im 20, pretending to be a little girl and not growing up and acting like i should. maybe theyll be kind to me when im crazy. let me go like i want to somedays. wonder what it would be like. do you just stop knowing or does a bit of you carry on. such a weird thing to contemplate. and for someone who doesnt like talking i sure do write a lot. in my head it makes sense. writing and typing is easier but i guess im just weird. i think im done complaining and being annoying now...

      he knew who i was in year 11?!!! i didnt even know he existed til i was in year 12, how bad is that? its really weird when you find out that people have know who you are for longer than you thought. its the ball tonight! yay!!!! its v weird, im never gonna see some of my friends again coz theyre in upper sixth and are, therefore, going away to uni in september. its really weird. worse than  leaving my junior school and worse than leaving year 11. as you can tell i dont really like loosing people who im used to having around. well not anymore anyways. didnt really used to mind coz no-one much liked me, i was just the little freak girl they bullied but now im happy and theres people i know i dont want them to go!!!!! they should all stay at sixth form til next year and then we could all go to uni at the same time meaning i had more chance of seing them again!! oh well, im hoping the ball will be good so that its a good last memory of everyone being together. still v weird tho, arghhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      i always manage to ruin everything good. life got pretty shit adn i cut again. not very sensible but its what i do. anyways... that was a few days ago and my b/f found out today. he was not so happy. as you would expect really but you know, everytime someone disapproves of what i do to deal with my shit it hurts. over the last couple of days weve been having a really good time and this has just fucked it up when everything was going so well. the reasons behind why i cut had nothing to do with him and he knows that (im not gonna go into it coz i really dont want to) it just happened that other shit happened that made the good stuff with him disappear from my head while i was in such a mood. doesnt mean anythings wrong with him and stuff i just get screwed up in my head and i cant see anything to do except cut. i dont mean to do it and hurt other people but everytime it gets so bad that i want to cut i give in and screw up stuff in my life that i dont want to screw up.  my b/f is really sweet and always tries to make me smile and make sure im happy and i love him for it. but sometimes i get scared when im with him coz of how he makes me feel. i forget about pretty much everything else and i dunno... i just... i dunno, i cant explain it... its kinda like the thing from cruel intentions when the girl says that she doesnt trust herself around the guy... and i know it sounds so stupid to relate a film to my life and stuff but i totally understand it. ive always thought that i knew what i wanted from a guy and that i wanted everything to be perfect and like the fairytale ive written a thousand times in my head. then im with my b/f and i dont care about this dream ive had, he just makes me not care about it, i just want to lose control and see what happens. and then i get scared by myself coz i think that maybe its not what i want but such a strong part of me is saying that it is. i dont want to give it all to one person and then lose it all because im so scared of whats happening. my head is so messed up...   i shouldnt shut you out of here i shouldnt close my heart i know i have to let you in i know its what i need sorry i dont make it right sorry i cant give in my body's crying out for more my heart wants to let you in but my mind keeps thinking what if its wrong? what if its not alright?

      i love my life ^_^ *giggles and smiles* its so fun ~_^ teeheehee   i got this poem from a website but i dunno who the author is. i love it and it makes sense to me at the moment...   I Hate The Way I Love You   I hate your laugh I hate your smile I hate your hair I hate your style  I hate the way you look at me With that special glimmer in your eye I hate the way you touch my body Making me feel like I’m gonna melt and die  I hate the way you talk to me And whisper sweet things in my ears I hate the way you hold me tight And scare away all my fears  I hate the way you run your fingers through my hair And wrinkle your cute little nose I hate the way you kiss my neck And how you say I smell like a rose  I hate the way you act big and bad To show me you’re all good I hate the way you make me think of you And not give up like I should  I hate the cute way you beg me To always get your way I hate the way you leave me hanging And always wanting you to stay  I hate the way you’ve confused me And not knowing what to do I hate everything you’ve done to me To make me fall in love with you.   i know it says the word 'hate' a lot but in my reading of it its a really sweet poem about how much the person loves their g/f. (and just a little note for someone - dont take the line 'i hate the way you kiss my neck' literally, coz its really nice when you do that ^_^) wish i could write something like that, just cant at the moment, even if i am all happy and yay-ey!! anywayz... life is fun ^_^

      i was gonna torture myself and drink my last can of mountain dew but i decided against it. if i drink it its like im finally letting go and i dont want to just yet, someday i will and then itll all be great but just at the moment i wanna keep it for a bit longer. to memories, and keeping them alive. not forgeting and treasuring good times, forgeting bad things and focusing on good. there were good times. i cant remember the bad times, selective memory i guess. to saying sorry, and meaning it. to that one person i say this - im sorry, i didnt want to hurt you, still dont, hope we can be close agin someday, but in a different way. and now im rambling so ill shut up.    now for a different subject... wrote this a little while ago... sont really know where it came from, just my weird mind i guess.... or some sub-conscience thing... hum...    Anymore.   This is not my goodbye I just don't want to say hello anymore. Tired of always having to try Can't take anymore of this My mind will stop you talking I'm not hearing anymore Bored of you always telling me How love can make you crazy That you don't mean to hurt me And you want to try again. My hello's are all gone for you, I just don't have a goodbye.

      i feel ok again today. i think my mood swings are getting weirder.  saw my b/f today, hurray!!! he was ok bout my arm, not happy but were still together so its good, and i think im gonna try harder nto to cut coz i figured out how annoyed and upset i was when my ex used to do it so im assuming that my current b/f is feeling how i felt. and i dont want him to. and that makes sense to me...  got kristian Leontiou's album today, its v good, relaxing and just great really, lol  also figured out that my funeral for a friend album is amazing! i keep forgeting it then going back to it and thinking wow this rules!!! lol, as you can probably tell i am a lot better today...  la la la   music is amazing... and i think i may be beginning to ramble so im gonna shut up! toodle pip!

      i fucked up again. as usual. and i care that i did but at the same time i dont. my b/f is really not happy with it and i have a feeling its all gonna go very wrong. but i usually look on the dark side of things so who knows.  managed to reach 5 months without fucking up completely so maybe itll keep going. i still dont like saturdays and im now beginning to dislike fridays as well. im just gonna end up hating everyday. i really want to go to bed this afternoon but i have to go to fucking work so i guess that plans out. just have to sleep more tonight, but i dont seem to sleep as well any more. dont really know why.  and now i dont really have anything else to write but i just dont want to go and do homework so ill sit here and write some more crap that i might come up with.  my mum saw my arm. shes not happy about it, wants me to stop and doesnt know how. everyone says that, they say they want me to stop but no one can figure out how to make me stop. i cant even figure out how to. my b/f wants me to get rid of my blade but if i do ill just find something else. i guess i can only stop when i want to, when i wont go looking for more blades or other ways to hurt me. i think thats gonna be the hardest thing. if my blades gone ill find a different way. at least i think i will. im pretty sure i wont do what my mum told me to, she told me to go see her and talk to her when i want to cut. she said i dont have to talk, shell just give me a hug or whatever but i dont think ill do that. i hate having to ask people for things. even when it'd probably be for my own good. its so stupid. im so stupid, i know i shouldnt do it, i know its dangerous, i know i could get really sick, i know i could end up dead, i know ill be scared for the rest of my life but none of that seems to bother me. otehr people get so worked up about me dying or whatever but it just doesnt seem to bother me. i guess im just messed up to care anymore.   dont tell me that you love me unless you really mean coz i might do something stupid like believe it.

      today was a crap day, i felt like shit for pretty much no reason and therefore people kept asking me if i was ok. i mean, its pretty obvious that im not ok but still people ask me, its so stupid. and the worst thing is that i have no idea why i feel so shite and i cant figure out anything thats happened to make me feel crap.  guess im just a screwed up little girl but i think everyone already knew that. my ex kinda annoyed me today but that wasnt why i was down, it just made me a bit more annoyed. its stupid coz before i would have just laughed at what he was doing but today it really hacked me off. guess thats what changing things does to you, isnt life just fantastic?

      i think ive decided that saturdays are the days that i hate the most. they make me feel depressed and icky and like i want to curl up in my room and slash my wrists, how fantastic?  i managed to go 4 days without cutting and then on thursday i messed up. had a bit of a falling out with my b/f and then i felt horrible coz i hadnt tried to make up with him or anything and i felt like shit and i had to do it. i cut over a previous one so no-one noticed but im sure someone will now... *sigh* so messed up.  started the A2 courses and i dont really like any of them. although my maths teacher that i did hate wasnt so bad when i had him yesterday.  wish it would hurry up and be monday already. i think mondays my favourite day, beginning of the week so i know im gonna see people everyday and it means a really long time before i have to go to fucking sainsburys and get depressed about that. and now i haev to go coz im being yelled at by my mum that my lunch is getting cold.   dont you just love life?      no...

      me got boreded... me did v many quizzes.... me now posting quiz results.... la la la.... not sure if theyre all true or not but oh well!!!    A GAME-BOY.

      its now wednesday, the last time i cut was saturday, this is, i think, good progress.  sitting talking to people is fun. KT and phil were at mine yesterday evening and it was so nice to just sit out in the garden and talk (and be fairly embarassed too, that was not as fun!)  got showbiz by muse for £3.99 today! and i know i keep saying i dont like muse and i do try to insist that i dont but i actually do ok!!! im just weird! anyways, love the album, unintended is such a good song *smiles*  la la la.... dont really know what else to say... have to go back to college tomoro, not so happy, especially as the weathers so nice! went swimming in the sea yesterday, it was really cold but good fun!  dont really know what else i have to say.....   parents shouldnt be so good at creeping up on you....   im bored...   havent been on deviant art for ages.... or quizilla.... may have to do some more quizzes.... if i do ill post the results, lol!   i think my b/f may be a little annoyed at me coz im not going to watch him play footie tonight. but theyll be no one there that i know, i wont get to spend much time with him and im kinda tired. to me this adds up to reasons why im not going but im not too sure that hes ok with me not going even tho he said he is. but neh, i never really know, guys are so complecated!  now i really think ive run out fo things to say... quite impressive really, lol!

      i think i blog too much, no one else ever seems to update and im always here moaning about shit. ive finished my exams now so i have a few days off then i have to go back to start the A2 course, how fun? i have to go to work tomoro and i really dont want to. i really hate my job, more than most people i think. i would actually rather have no money than work in sainsburys. thats how much i hate it. havent cut today, yet... i guess theres still time tho... my arm is kinda a mess, but then again when isnt it? just a little wont hurt im sure. could be the end of me and cadet boy tho, but i think he did say that he couldsnt bring himself to make me make the decision, may have just been dreaming tho. and it doesnt really feel like were together anyways, not too sure why, maybe its just my fucked up mind. oh well, could be worse i spose, could not have the escape... and now its time for me to stop typing coz im just getting more fucked up and will quite possibly just end up writing more stuff to piss people off. oh well, life goes on and just keeps fucking me off.

      ok, so i managed to go for like, 4 days without cutting and then it all went a little wrong. im gonna blame it on the "exam stress" but to be honest i have no idea why i cut. although thats a lie. i felt like i wanted to cut and tried to use one of the prevention things where you draw with red pen where you want to cut instead of actually cutting. but that just made me want to cut more and i did. its really stupid, ill stop for a while and then just go and do it again. then i get real annoyed at myself for doing it and fucking up and ill tell myself im gonna stop again but i always fuck it up. its so stupid and annoying. and i know its just really messed up and i shouldnt do it and ill probably end up regretting it and hating my scars but i just cant seem to stop. i dont even do it coz i feel like shit i just do it even when im happy. its so screwed up. adn i ahev a chem exam tomoro and i really need to revise, fuck, three units of work to learn before 9am tomoro. some how i dont think im gonna do so well.

      went to see InMe yesterday!!! it was amazing! my first gig at 17, lol! it was so good! they are so good live! and the two support band were really good too - save ourselves and x is loaded, both v good bands but InMe were best (as you would expect really!) but it was really good. even though i dont normally like crowds or loud music or getting really hot, lol! not really the best person to go to a gig when i say things like that but it was amazing and i really enjoyed it, yay!!!!  had a rather nasty family gathering today, i mean it was nice but i hate talking to people and stuff so its not really a good thing for me! and people were getting drunk and stuff which i also dont like so much. *sigh* drunk people are either good or bad, the good ones are ok, the bad ones are not (funny that!) and my mother is not a good sort of drunk (in my eyes anyway) so that was not so fun. and also, this will probably sound very nasty, but my youngest cousin can get so annoying! hes only 5 (or 6, i cant actually remember!) and he just reminds me of all the reasons i dont like children, lol! they just want attention all the time and they want to play games and you dont want to but then they kinda sulk and its just all so scream inducing!!!!!! its nice to see people but i dont like it when theres so many people and little brat type child to "entertain" i think i would have happily put him in the pond to drown, and no-one else would have noticed coz they were/are all drunk! everyones gone now and it feels weird with only four people in the house but its also quite nice to see how quiet it is.  four days, arent you proud. even though i have spent a large portion of my time thinking about it or writing about it or thinking about something to do with it, i have managed to be "good" for four days. for me this is like a minor miracle. lets just keep hoping i dont fuck up.

      i gave blood today. how great am i? it was a fun experience. but when they took the little bit of blood from my finger to see if i was ok to donate, i really wanted to "drink" the blood. its not so healthy. cut my arm again last night. have LIE written on it where the little scratches were/are. looks like im gonna be getting the ultimatum.... thing is its an impossible decision. choose the guy or the blade. you cant actually do it. i feel like i need both of them. the blades a way of coping, lets me leave all the stuff in my life and lets me focus on one thing and i like seeing the blood. its pretty, it tastes good. i dont really know what else to say... dont have anything else to say, never really have anything to say but manage to ramble on just the same.... bolt.com is beign annoying, put a post on one of the boards and now its messed up so i cant see the replies, it sucks, stupid net. really wanna do something but cant be arsed to find anything to do... oh well, maybe ill watch tv or eat something, even though im getting fat/fatter. i hate being me, i actually really suck. guess i could spend my time trying to figure out what the answer to the ultimatum will be.... i know what it should be but i dont know if i can give up cutting. im not even sure if i want to at the moment.

      you know there are some days when you just cant be bothered with the world anymore and you just wanna stay in bed, or find some nice metal to play with. well, today is one of those days. i wanted to stay in bed but got up coz my b/f was coming over and staying in bed would not have been an option really. parents would have made me get up anyway. and then theres the playing with metal. something that really appeals, but could end with me not having a b/f anymore. really want to play though. the cold of the blade, the feeling of is sliding across my skin and digging in. the blood, warm and so pretty. blossoming in little spots before running and becomming lines. then to feel it on my lips, on my tongue, in my mouth. metallic and satisfying. this is why people get addicted. its not just the pain, its the whole process. i want to bleed again. i want to feel my skin breaking and see that my body is still working even though my thoughts are telling me that im not. i do this because i want to. not to get attention, and when it does get me attention i shy away from it, try to get it to go away, i hate the attention it brings but i keep doing it because i like it, it makes me feel different, a different that i enjoy. its amazing to find out how diffreent types of cut produce different amount of blood. the deeper ones often produce less than the little scratches. you find ways of covering up the places where you cut, find ways of gettign the same feeling without having the marks in places where people will see them and make comment. you become a master in the art of deception. this isnt something to be proud of and, as many people have told me over the last few days, im gonna have scars forever and ill probably hate them. right now i dont think about that. all i think about is the fact that i want to see my skin open and red with my blood. i want to taste it in my mouth and see that im alive and healthy. in body if not in mind. sometimes there are things you want and then a while later you wont want it so much. cutting doesnt follow this rule. i can think of stuff that does but cutting isnt one of them. no matter how much you tell yourself that you dont want to cut a little bit of your mind will still crave that feeling, the feeling that you can only get from dragging a blade across your skin and watching the shapes that are formed. thats why its so hard to stop. and thats why i could never make the decission i might be faced with. i want both. and at the same time i want only one. ill leave you to work out which one id prefer.

       im proving myself right at the moment coz im bored and feeling kinda crap and blooging, therefore my theory for blogging is right. also looking at deviantart so i must be slipping back to my fucked up ways coz i seem to blog and devaint when im fucked up. havent found that many good pics on deviant yet tho, but i havent been looking for that long (by my standards)      anyways.... been doing lots of overtime at sainsburys so i can buy a new phone when i next get paid. and the overtime hasnt been that bad, i was quite suprised.      havent seen my b/f that much recently. saw him tuesday and i was fucked off with him so wasnt that great. saw him on wednesday too for about 20 mins coz he came over before i had my driving lesson but i didnt know he was coming over and id gone out so i only got to see him quickly before i went out again. saw him properly for the first time today when we werent pissed off with each other so that was nice.      my rents are going out tomoro so thatll be fun. waking up to an empty house coz my sisters working, then going into town with my sister when she gets home. coming back, going to work then getting a lift back from my sister before she goes out clubbing. oh well, guess ill get to watch a load of farScape tomoro evening! i started watching at the first episode and im going all the way through the four seasons in order. its v gd for me coz i liek farScape, im sure loads of people would rather poke their eyes tho.      dockers party on monday although i dont actually know anything about it. ive been told theres an email but i havent got one so i guess im not invited.... would make sense if i wasnt actually... well to me anyway... i think i fucked up a bit with him....      not really a lot to say... im fucked up right now i cant release it. fuck all the people who wanted me to stop. i have now and im still fucked up. im just not showing it anymore. blood is good you fucked up people, it makes me better, stops me from looking for other ways to fuck my life up, at least with the bleeding it ws controled, wasnt making people hate me. the other things i think of doing would fuck me up and most probably otehr people too. i didnt want to quit, i was made to, my cravings still there, i still want blood, i still want to carve up my arm and watch myself bleed, i want to have scars, i want blood pouring down my arm and dripping off my fingers. im sorry if im fucked up but its just how i am.      bleed from scars and bleed from cuts, no one fucking cares

       ok, so, went to alton towers, it was good.&nbsp; nemesis was wicked although my bag got nicked while i was on it. bye bye phone. sorted it out tho, got a new sim card with my old number and im currently using my sisters old phone so i&nbsp;am connected to the world again.     not really too sure what else to write... my b/f has gone away for a week. that kinda sucks coz it means ages without seeing him, he was meant to come over on monday before he left but then couldnt so that kinda sucked. bored with being at home already. only the first real week of the holidays and im bored already. so bored and pissed off that im doing overtime at sainsburys. just proves how shit my life is right now.     &nbsp;   im v bad at giving up and quitting, it still isnt going so well. i keep messing up, not so good. i really dont know of anything else i have to say so im gonna sit here listening to music until i figure out something to type.     &nbsp;   was a web site about self injury earlier and found out that johnny depp used to self harm. i didnt know that and it kinda gives me some hope. i was reading about these people who used to harm and have managed to stop. they have successful careers and found happiness. heres to hoping that we can all do the same. bit of a long shot to hope everyone can but i can try to be optimistic for once. makes a change for me. i had a conversation with one of my friends the other day and he said that i was just a naturally unhappy person, like him. even when theres nothing effecting our moods we are more inclined to be miserable than happy or in the middle. its really odd. &nbsp;   &nbsp;  bolt.com has changed. i dont like it as much now, it was easier to navigate in the old style. and cherry639 is still not working so i had to be reborn as chiana. its v odd. i think i only ever blog on here when im really fucked off, messed up or happy... and when im bored... which usually leads me on to feeling shit.    &nbsp;  and now im really bored so my mums suggested i do the hand washing so im going to. itll use up a bit of my time i spose....    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  ...see the friend ill always have, her love will never leave...

      bolt.com is a fucking whore. it wont let me log in even though i know i haev the right password and login name and then when i make a new accout so i can fucking find out what the hells going on it tells me im on line as cherry639 even though im not, for fucks sake its so stupid. anyways, im perfectly calm.  this weekend has been better than normal coz i didnt have to go to work and ive been txting someone pretty much the whole weekend, lol.  im seriously fucking bored now though, i have nothing that i want to do except cut and im not allowed to do that. it sucks. i hate fucking quiting. its just messing me up more. and i really wanna cut coz of some shit that happened last thursday. my b/f says hes ok with but i know hes not. i know he loves me which scares the hell out of me and i know i shouldnt have done the stuff that i did but i was trying to have a good time ffs. even though what i did wasnt really part of me trying to have a good time, it was just shit that happened.  my b/f came over today but only for a while coz he had to go home coz he was going out, oh yay, how fun that was. i think he was kinda annoyed coz i was txting a guy who he now has issues with coz of thursday although he said he wasnt. its so fucked up. my mind is getting really messed up and shit. i just wanna curl up and die, or have someone kill me, that would be fine too. oh, and one of my best friends hates my b/f and says we have to talk bout it coz of shit thats happening and im just so fucked with everything. if youre in love with one guy and like another and shits going down what the fuck do you do? i mean, this is probably gonna fuck up a few of my relationships/friendships, but seriously, what the fuck do i do? do i carry on with the guy i love and then get really hurt when it all falls apart as it always does or do i just fuck it all and piss around as much as i can? i mean i know i wont fuck around coz i like my b/f way too much to fuck it up now, but the little things in your mind are always there, the what ifs, the i wonders, its so fucked. and by the end of this i will be amazed if i still have any friends, let alone a b/f.

      something has just finally reached me, i am totally over my last b/f. that sounds kinda harsh but its not really meant to. ive just realised that when i see him or pictures of him i remember the past but dont want to go back there. it was great what we had but i dont want to have it again, not even a tiny bit. before there was always a little part of me that wondered but now i just dont. i just want to get on with my life as it is now. although my current b/f may feel a little weird that its taken me this long to let go of my ex completely i guess it will also be a relief for him... i think. right now all i want is him and that makes me feel happy and smiley. :D  my ex got back with the person he broke up with on monday. not too sure how its all gonna go now but i wish them well.   i made pastys!!! yay me!!! and theya re amazing even if i do say so myself, LOL!! but i do have flour all over me now, but its all fun!!  really wish cadet boy was here... dont like saying goodbye to him. it sucks.... but i dont, ha ha ha!!!! yes im crazy, do you have a problem with that???????????  la la la.... not really sure i have much else to say..... been more than a week without cutting, yay me!! doop di doo....  so up for it... ;) teeheehee!!! would be so fun, and if its not oh well, just refuse, lol!!!! i know what i mean, teeheehee!!!

      Jays party was fun. even if i did kinda hide in the bathroom for quite a while. it was interesting tho, people kinda drifted in and talked. it was good. the drunk people were not so fun, throwing up, crying and just general bad drunk people. i mean, some people are ok drunk, fun infact but then you get the people that are just icky drink and you want to tell them to fuck off!!! cadet boy was drunk, despite him trying to deny it, and he got pretty um... i guess emotional is the right word. that was not so fun, trying to convince your b/f that everything is fine and youre not gonna break up with him, cheat on him or otherwise do anyhting to hurt him is v hard when hes drunk and youre trying to make sure that other drunk people are being looked after or are ok being drunk. but cadet boy was also being very sweet, hes ok drunk until he started being v emotional, that made it not so fun. but over all i think it was a fun night, i didnt know quite a few of the people there and i did kinda hide away but i saw some people i havent spoken to properly for a while so that was real nice. and one of my friends from junior school has turned into quite a nice young lady :p he he he!!!  i found out something a few minutes ago that i didnt think was gonna happen so quickly. i spoke to one of the people yesterday and i thought it was gonna happen but i didnt realise how quickly. and please dont anyone get mad at anyone else for what i just wrote. im thinking about deleting that bit but then my diary wouldnt be whole and then it would be weird.  i was having real trouble at my dance class today, i cant do the new routine and its really pissing me off. pissing me off so much that i felt like i wanted to cut. i havent coz i know that the consequences would be way too bad for the relief of cutting... makes sense to me... but i didnt cut and im not going to, would upset too many people etc etc...  went on a biology field trip today.... to a field! how amazing, learnign about bio diversity so we got to go to a field and count plants, oh so fun!!! was nice to be outside all day but it was kinda boring. and also i was so tired for not being in bed til half midnight and then having to get up at half seven and i kept waking up in the night *cry* it sucks!!! i really need sleep so i think im gonna stop typing crap and actually go to bed, lol!!    turn the lights down low, take it off, let me show, my love for you insatiable, turn me on, never stop, wanna taste every drop, my love for you insatiable ~ so love that song!!

      saturday again. how fun? it 12:30 and i havent even got dressed yet. have work at 4:30 which im not too happy bout and its a saurday so i feel shit and want to cut but cant. i think i might go back to my sit ups and press ups routine. 100 sit ups 50 press ups (at the very least) each day. its good for me and takes my mind off everything else. i did it for ages before and i dont think i cut as much when i was doing it adn it makes me healthier, fitter, less fat etc also go back on the healthy eating thing, less junk more fruit adn veg, less snacking more healthy meals. its all a good idea. and no i wont end up with an eating disorder, i love food too much to do that. and besides id just be back at square one, a crazy girl with an addiction - not really a good place to be. hopefully if i stick to it ill get thinner and look better and my skin might get better too, see lots of positive things that will happen, no negative, arent you impressed?  not too sure i have anything else to say. i have homework to do but of course im not doing it coz i cant be bothered. maybe ill do some ive done my sit ups etc and had a shower and got dressed... although by then itll probably be lunch time... wonder if we ahev any salad... i dont like being me. its ok when im happy i guess but quite a lot of the time im not and then i hate being me. i officially suck. do you think that one day ill accept who i am and be happy with it? or is that just some wishful thinking? people tell me that im pretty and intelligent and a nice person but i still cant believe a word of it. they must be looking at a different person coz the one i see is none of those things. and now i must sound really messed up and stupid and like i should be locked away so that i can fuck around any more. maybe that would be the best idea, for myself and the rest of society. i like the idea of having a padded room, all bouncy and squishy, would be fun... and now i really dont think i have anything else to say...  lost my will cant get it back, just leave me here to die

      i hate saying goodbye. cadet boy came back to mine after college and i really didnt want him to go when he had to. i dont liek goodbyes. will see him on sunday tho, mates having a bday party so yay!!!!! but thats not how i feel at the moment. i was fine til my b/f had to go home. and thatll probably make him feel bad or sound real mean so ignore me... i feel like i wanna cut but i cant. promise made to too many people this time and also bad consequences if i do cut again but im not going into it. just suffice to say im not gonna be cutting again (i dont think)  dont think i really have anything else to say... im real thirsty and tired so i think im gonna have a drink and go to bed, how sensible? might txt cadet boy.... hum... oh well, later dayz...
