       I went on 18 "dates" last night. As you can imagine, I was the most, er, festive one there. These are some of the more colorful things that were said to me.   You look exactly like an ex girlfriend of mine  You look very creative (this I heard 5 times)  Are you really a lesbian?  You're probably bi, right?  You know that part in gone with the wind where the daughter falls off the horse and breaks her neck? That is the best part of that movie.  You don't look like you even know what a golf club is.  You don't look like someone who would play golf.  Do you have any pets?  Do you like other peoples' pets?  Do you have any children?  Do you like other people's children?  Are you a top or a bottom?  I see you are hurry drinking to go along with the hurry dating.  What toner do you use?  You like star trek? Are you a geek?  Your underwear is showing.  Does the carpet match the drapes?  My last girlfriend was 20 years older than me. How old are you?     Whew! I mean, I know I have some social skills issues but jeez!  Actually, I am easily amused so all of these statements and questions were met with mirth.

        Greetings all, More exciting smarty pants goings ons. Here you go!     1) My friend watches a soap opera. So I was giving her a bunch of crap about    that until this happened: Man is attending the wedding of one of his daughters    with his girlfriend. He has an ex-wife but loathes her so tells everyone she is    dead. Ex-wife and girlfriend meet in the bathroom and have a row. Ex-wife    pitches one in the middle of the wedding which is then called off. Oh my god,    never mind my objections, this is EXACTLY like my soap!     2) The golf coven Heather’s here object to slow play (and god knows we can't    play ready golf, that is some sissy American rule). But you've seen me in action. "Where’s my ball? Here, I'll help you find your ball. Oh, I need a mulligan. Oops now I need another mulligan. I have to go to the bathroom. Wait, I need to take a picture." etc. all. So it's nothing but slow play with me involved. We ended up letting four, that's right FOUR, groups play through! It    was the longest nine holes of my life. I think it took 3 hours or something.     3) The Kingdom of Fife is a magical place. Too bad they already have their    quota of fairy princesses. They really do not know what they are missing, not    having me in the position.     4) They have such bizarre names for stuff here that it's no fun for me to use    my nicknames. For example the BQ is the home depot. Which I would refer to as    the homo depot. But why bother? Home depot means nothing so homo depot wouldn't    be funny. Knackered is tired. A 1st story condo is a 2nd story condo, a vest is    a wife beater, mad means insane not angry, pissed means drunk not angry,  a    tattoo is a military marching, drumming thing. Fries are chips (big, soggy and    cold, yuck), if you like-like someone you fancy them, if it's bullshit it's    crap. If you're telling some silly story with facts and statistics you've    pulled out of your bottom, it's crap. (sorry McKenna)    But Africa hot? That's one they don't have and absolutely love.(Although how    the mid to low 70s can be considered Africa hot is beyond me)     5) "Are you going to smoke that fag or play some golf?" (Umm, ok I know  fag   means cigarette but it still comes as a shock the first time somebody  says it   and actually means it). Oh ye of little faith, I will be doing both at the same    time. Could this have added to the slow play? Nah .    6) Luckily the high 5 isn't popular here. It has been pulled on me 3 times    though. So I taught them my special, alternative high 5. They now think it is a    wacky American thing. Ha, ha, I'm making the rest of you look mad too.     7) Everyone I've met has been quite surprised that I liked to drink. They had    heard Americans didn't. But I've proved to them that we Americans are as  big of  drunky drunks as the Scottish. Ha, Ha I'm still making the rest of you look mad.     8) Ok this is odd. Maybe I've missed something in the translation (or I could    quite possibly have been drunk) but my friends here have decided that  Valerie    is my stage name. What the hell?! I've never even mentioned any stories involving stages.     9) When we went to St. Andrews last week we had a nice picnic by the sea and there were some kids splashing around in the water and they were blue. So my friend decides I absolutely have to "go into the ocean" while I'm here. This particular torture is planned for tomorrow.   I tried to explain about my "pool" at home and how it is blood warm. And how, even at 8 at night I can stand around in my swim suit and cowboy hat flicking ashes and skimming leaves and it is still Africa hot. Now did you see the phrase "bloody freezing cold water" anywhere in that story? No, you did not. I didn’t pack a swimsuit either so whatever I wear is bound to be disturbing and not swimming related in any way.     10) As you may or may not know, I am a geriatric magnet. Some people are freak magnets, well the senior citizens are drawn to me. You'll be amused to learn that has not changed one bit here in Edinburgh. All I have to do is pull a map out of my pocket, don't even have to unfold it, and the next thing I know the    nearest little old lady has me by the arm dragging me off to my destination. On the way to the library a few minutes ago I was stopped by a geriatric and told I had, "lovely, just really lovely" legs. The only person that has told me I had hot legs was some 70-year-old grandmother. Yeah, that's lovely all right.     Tee hee, well I guess that's all for now. I will see you all very soon and I’m sure I will have more special, surly Valerie stories for you about my adventures in Scotland.    Love,    Bonny Queen Valerie the Bruce

       Greetings all! I'm having a most excellent time here in Edinburgh. As you can imagine, I am also driving the locals insane. Check out all the fine things I’ve had said to me.     1) Fat bastard from Austin Powers is not a hero to the Scottish people.   Stop bringing it up.     2) Chain mail is not a tax write off even if you are "king Arthur reincarnated".     3) Wearing a kilt without underwear has not been a practice of ours for many, many years. However, we would enjoy and encourage you to do so.     4) King Arthur is neither real nor Scottish. Please stop demanding to see the sword in the stone.     5) Yes, we know what a razor is. But shaving (faces, pits, legs etc.) Cuts into our drinking time.         So bugger off you big, blond shaving obsessed American.     6) How can you possibly be cold? We're in the middle of a heat wave.        Perhaps you should stop staggering about half-naked and go put on some pants.     7) (From some bagpipe players) no, we don't know "kill you" by Eminem.  Please stop        requesting it.     8) Bijork is not even Scottish. Please stop insisting the entire country is going to hell for "releasing that yowling generation x Yoko Ono onto the rest of the world". (sorry Vicky)     9) You're still cold? Drink more beer that’s warm at least.     10) Shagging on the links? Is that another fat bastard/ Austin Powers crack?    You've been warned.     11) The entire population is truly a six pack away from being as queer as a football bat. But nobody gets offended when you tell them that because, loosely translated it means, "your soccer equipment is odd and drunk".      Well that's all the offensiveness for now. I'll write again later in the week.    Love,    Valerie

       Reggie, Reggie, my cute, little bad actor. What a place to build your acting chops, huh? In Pine Valley with the gauze covered, scenery chewing, fit pitching rock-heads, thick necks and anorexic neurotics. What sort of a nickname fits you? Iced cherry cola? Grand master lite whipping cream in peach syrup? DJ jazzy vanilla crepe? And child, who is dressing you? Find out which dresser Boyd, Anna and Lena blew and “take a meeting”. Steer clear of whoever is dressing Kendall, Liza and Mia though (I’m thinking somebody lost a bet). Or maybe the whole “I refuse to let any specific clothing company say they dress me so I am forced to wear the same dreck everyday” line of fashion popular with Ryan, Aiden and Tad’s putz son is more your style.  I just don’t know. I have become weary my little Bo Derek braided cupcake, I will ponder your dilemma(s) later.  Juan Pablo?  What is your damage ? You are so not from Argentina. White trash from France? Possibly. Former cabana boy from Key West? Probably. And claiming that you and Carlos are brothers is preposterous. That is like saying Shannon Doherty and I are twins! Sure, we’re both surly white women but similar bad attitudes does not make us related. I’ll buy Bianca as Erica’s daughter and if I’m drunk and squinting even that Greenlee is the offspring of Jackson. And I know the name of the show is  all my children  but come on people! Is it too much to ask for a little genetic continuity? Perhaps you could say you were brothers from different mothers. And from different fathers. Brothers of the soul? Yeah, that’s it! Why do we have to say Juan  and  Pablo? Is that like your version of Mary Alice? Bobby Lee? Tiffany Amber? Should it be hyphenated in print? Should it be hyphenated in my mind every time Mary comes listing past for a drink and squeals your name?     When MTV first started showing the real world my sisters and I got hooked. But it was only entertaining for 10 minutes so we would play this game where we would re cast it with people we knew who were tons more entertaining than the actual real world cast. Anyway, that is the premise of today’s game. I’m recasting AMC but have decided I need a theme. What fun would it be if I could recast with anybody in the world? (Well it might be funny but I have a theme damnit so that’s how this is going to play out.) I am limiting my casting choices to celebrities from the 70s. Not the way they are today, in 2003 (if they are in fact even still living), but the way they were in their shiny, bizarrely fashioned, oddly coifed 70s prime. I might be using their real names or their character names.  I know  the actors’ names but it will have more impact in some cases to use the character name. If you need to know the actors’ name(s), ask me later.         AMC Character	New Disco 70s replacement	Comments (oh you  know  I’m going to have comments) Erica Kane	Cher	Well Cher was always going on about how she was so put upon (you know, gypsies, tramps and thieves) and her daughter ended up being Lebanese too Bianca	Kristy McNicol	Yummy. And wait till you see who’s playing Lena Kendall	Marcia Brady	Marcia and Kendall? They are both far superior than the rest of us Jackson	Michael Landon	Pa Ingalls was just as thick and lantern jawed as Jackson.   Mary	Lynda Carter	It would be written into her contract that she would have to wear the wonder woman bracelets in every scene she has with people she is in conflict with. Which is to say, every scene. Even when she is just ordering a drink, there is a conflict.  Greenlee	Tantum O’Neal	Bad haircut, big eyes, surly and belligerent-a perfect match. Reggie	Chachi	Would Greenlee love Chachi? I believe so. Juan Pablo	Donny Osmond	Casting Donny and Erik as brothers makes more sense than the way they have it cast.  Carlos	Erik Estrada	Plus, Donny and Erik were way cute. Maggie	Cheryl Ladd	Don’t know if Charlie’s littlest angel can pull off being a completely clueless dope but I can live with Cheryl Ladd giving Kristy McNicol “hugs for support” all the time Lena	Kate Jackson	See? How fabulous is that? Kristy and Kate,  oh yeah.  Boyd	Leif Garrett	I toyed with the idea of casting a female as Boyd but Leif was just as pretty as a little girl and none too bright. Except for not being quite gay enough, this is a perfect casting. Ryan	Jan Michael Vincent or Michael York	While both Jan and Michael were 70s tousled hair beautiful (unlike Ryan who is a lump) their acting skills, which consist of a lot of furrowed brows and mouth breathing, are perfect for the role of Ryan.    Anna	Olivia Newton John	Oh nice one! See how I replaced one accented hottie with another?  Aiden	Rick Springfield	And even better, another accented one replaced the nephew of the hottie. This choice is also very ironic because while they were pushing Rick hard to be a teen idol in the 70s (he even had a Sat morn. cartoon show for flip’s sake) he never really hit big until the 80s.  On a soap opera! David	John Boy Walton	All that sensitive whining and the dopey 5 o’clock shadow made this a perfect match. Tad	Dick Van Patten	A Dick playing a Tad? Oh that’s good. Is 8 really enough to fill your world with love Dick? How about you Tad?  Tad’s putz son	Vince Van Patten	A real life father and son playing a TV father and son. I am good. And Vince was a beautiful boy. The god of all 70s mouth breathing beautiful boy actors. Edmund	The Captain	The Captain would have to learn to speak on occasion but… Maria	And Tennille	Tennille was just as damn perky as Maria ever is. Myrtle	Charo	This really makes no sense but how funny would that be? Mia	Jan Brady	So that the heads filled with rocks, anorexic, trying to catch a man story line could continue. Really the only difference these 2 would bring to the show is longer hair to flip and fling Simone	Laurie Partridge	 Mary	Suzanne Pleshette	Yeah, I know I already did Mary. But then I got involved in a conversation recently about Suzanne and she would be perfect too. Who wouldn’t want to see her and anybody else listed here in a finger shaking, eyebrow waggling, deep voiced growling, slap fight?!    Whew! Well, that was really fun. I know I left out some good Characters (Liza, Opal, Val etc.) but I couldn’t really think of…. Who am I kidding? I was tired. I promise to someday write an actual “update” but every time I get ready to do that I end up going off on tangents about gauze covered lenses or fashion sense or scenery chewing.  Maybe I will do another replacement casting. Only this time I will replace all the characters with characters from saved by the bell, 90210 and full house. Or something. Teehee, enjoy ladies. I was considering sending this to Vicky as well thinking it wouldn’t really matter if she didn’t know whom the AMC character was, only the amusing ness of the 70s replacement. But then I remembered her pop culture is zero.  Oh, Julie your (coke whore) cruise director as Liza! And Paul Lynde as Val. And Carol Burnett as Opal.  (Just like that. No comments though)

       Please note:  Edmund will be referred to as “Huey Lewis” (for glaringly obvious reasons)  Anyone without an assigned nickname that appears in a scene with Edmund will be referred to as “the News”  Every time there is a scene with Edmund “I want a new drug” needs to be sung at top volume  Ryan will be referred to as “the mouth breather” (or if the whim so strikes me, bad actor number 4)  Mia will be referred to as “Box ‘o” (as in dumber than a box o’ rocks)  Simone will be referred to as “Squeak” (as in dumber than a kitty squeak toy-oh, and also because her voice sounds like a squeak toy)  Greenlee will be referred to as “the closet case” (because she spends all of her time going into and coming out of the closet. Oh, and by the way Greenlee, you were a hottie as a blond. And those upper arm muscles? Yum, yum. Please, please come out of the closet for good and start getting into bar brawls and catfights with Lena and/or Anna.)  Boyd will be referred to as “Boy” (even though he is a bigger girl than I am.) Except for when he is wearing pink. Then he will be referred to as “lip liner-Boy”.  Lena will be referred to as “mine”. (Except when she is being forced to chew extra large chunks of scenery, then she will be referred to as “wasted in this gauze covered lens piece of excrement”)   Maggie will be referred to as “the not gay yet Mary Stuart Masterson” (or in a particularly poorly written scene with absolutely no character continuity “the tard friend”)  Aiden will be referred to as “lip liner Boy’s boyfriend” (and who exactly decided it was a good idea for Aiden to stop taking his medication anyway? Man, he is seriously way off his leash.)  Kendall will be referred to as “bipolar Sybil”     Anna is a bigger lesbian than Bianca. And what the hell is she doing with David?! She rolls her eyes and grimaces every time she sees him, plus he is a big twat.   David will be referred to as “that big twat”  Lena, forget about Bianca. There is no way in hell it was that good, plus, have you  met  her family? Jesus wept the baggage alone should scream “run! run away!” Look, Anna would be perfect for you. She obviously hates men (if her treatment of David, Aiden etc. is any indication) and she’s one surly (yet ineffective) chief of police.   Opal will be referred to as “the coke whore”  Mary Polanski? What a great name! Mary is supposed to be evil but she is really just a rich snob and therefore evil lite. Wait a minute, Cruella De Vil and Dr. Evil were rich snobs too and that didn’t slow them down. But she does list from side to side when she walks and is rarely without a fancy pants adult beverage so maybe her standing as evil will rise eventually.     Ok, let me get this straight (I said straight, teehee.): Jackson is Greenlee’s dad, Reggie’s dad and Bianca’s uncle. Erica is Bianca’s mom, Kendall’s mom and Jackson’s sister in law. If Jackson ever actually marries Erica (which won’t happen for at least 3 more sweeps from now-trust me, they are going to drag out the Bianca preggers slash where in the world is Michael Cambais etc. ad nausea) then that would make him: Greenlee and Reggie’s dad, Kendall’s step father and Bianca’s uncle-daddy! (or would that be daddy-uncle?) All my children my ass, this is all my incestual, anorexic neuroses.   What’s with all the gauze over the camera? I suppose I would understand if certain, geriatric actors only appeared under gauze but that is not the case. These people use gauze without any rhyme or reason. Or are they following some secret math vs. actor personality rule we aren’t privileged to? Do the camera operators go, “Ok yesterday Anna gave me 4 front row tickets to Cats and Boyd gave me cooties. And today the 2 of them are appearing in a scene with Huey Lewis and Jackson. Jackson is so sweet but dumber than a box of rocks and Huey and I go to the same ice skating rink but he only speaks to me when he is hopped up on crack. All 4 of them look like hell, so how about some gauze! Yeah gauze! Let’s use 4 layers instead of the usual 2.” Humph! Math is hard.        There are simply not enough slap fights and hair pulling on this show. Sure, every once in a while the gals of Fusion decide to go out for margaritas, get drunk and start slinging glasses. But with Kendall weighing in as the giant of the group at 58 pounds (as opposed to the 42 to 44 pounds the rest of them weigh), it’s a wonder any of them can hold up their rock filled, squeak toy heads much less throw an effective punch! The effort it would take to pull a blouse hard enough to get the buttons to pop off? Forget about it.

       Adam was in the process of tossing Mary to the curb when Junior got his hands on her. He discovered she had a better prescription drug connection than he did so insisted she stay. (By the way hasn’t Mary been punished enough? She is  so much  better as a snooty bitch looking down her nose at the unwashed masses than begging and simpering for discount champagne and places to keep her extensive toiletries and prescription drug collections.)  Kendall, Greenlee and the mouth breather got trapped in the fusion elevator because Greenlee and Kendall were “pushing too many buttons at once”. (Snort! Whatever. Punching too many buttons at once in elevators used to be a hobby of mine and I never got stuck. It’s also amusing to jump up and down to make it shake and push the alarm sound button but you’d better be bigger than everybody else on the elevator because these activities provoke panic and a great deal of hand swatting.)   So then Kendall and Greenlee started going at it with the yelling and hair tossing and finger shaking. I almost wet my pants because I was sure there was going to be a slap fight or at least some hair pulling. Sadly this did not happen. It also made the mouth breather sad so he removed his shirt so the ladies would pay attention to him. They couldn’t have cared less and neither could I.  Simone and Mia heard all the squealing and decided the 2 of them could run the show on their own. I laughed out loud because those 2 couldn’t run around in a circle much less run a company. Juan Poopie staggered along and “fig bee evavaturh”.  (I’ve decided this putz has a speech impediment as well as an accent like that dopey naked chef kid on the food network. Maybe I’d had too much beer but he gets harder and harder to understand every day and until I have proof that he does indeed have a speech impediment I am going to continue to mock the way he speaks. As if it’s ok to mock people with accents but not people with speech impediments.) As much as Juan Poopie blows I still have the mouth breather as next in line for the meat hook. He’s just that annoying.   Speaking of meat hooks, everybody is still staggering around looking for clues as to who put Michael on one. Erica is on holiday but she’d better get back to Pine Valley ASAP or else Jackson and David are going to have her accused, tried, convicted and sentenced. Whew! That’s a lot of scenery that needs to be chewed, she’d be devastated if she missed out on all that.  David and Aiden had a little spat. Aiden (off his medication yet again and back to breaking and entering) showed up at David’s fine home and pretended Anna called him to check up on David. David was all like, “you retarded limy faggot, how stupid do you think I am? Anna has my number and unlike you she has extensive practical skills like dialing a phone.” And Aiden just starred at his shoes. After all, he’d already stolen stuff, he didn’t really need to have a  good  excuse for being there, just as excuse. So off they went to the police station where a huge row ensued. David screaming about breaking and entering, Aiden screaming about seeing David pouring scotch into the potted plants the night Michael disappeared. Jackson screaming about how one cannot go around just stealing guns and giving them to the cops there’s laws to protect citizens you know, and the black cop (I don’t even know his name but I like him) screaming at all of them to shut up and get out. (Aiden is seriously obsessed about that damned scotch in the potted plant isn’t he? Jesus wept dude; I can understand you think its alcohol abuse and all but give it a rest. That’s what you get when you forget to take your medication.)         Is it just me or is David looking a little better? Maybe he got a tan on vacation or it could be he looks better because he is acting a little smarter. Anyway, this was the part of the show where Jackson and David proceeded to dis on Erica.   Maggie and Bianca are going back to school. What? I knew Maggie was pretending to be in college, she has a dorm room and she used to have a test cheating boyfriend but Bianca? I never had a clue. So Maggie finds out Bianca did not have a  procedure  and flips out. And there’s, like, 5 hours of whining and mugging over the subject. Luckily McKenna changed all the words to Madonna’s papa don’t preach and was singing that at top volume, drowning out the buzzing drone of Maggie.  Honestly, even if they were doing these scenes naked I’m not sure I could sit through them anymore. Oh yeah before the buzzing begins Bianca has to make a speech in the quad about how the man is keeping her down and how she is sick of all the whispering behind her back and if she hears any more of it she’s going to beat some asses. (She’s a former anorexic, pregnant 68 pound lesbian. Somehow I feel beating some asses is not something she is capable of.)  Bianca and Lena are back together! Oh, well, maybe not. I’m really not sure. But they did “go to Maggie’s dorm room” and give some speeches filled with misunderstandings and double talk. Bianca told Lena she was pregnant but failed to mention she did not have “the procedure”. Since the last time Lena eavesdropped “the procedure” was still the hip happening thing to do. So of course Lena told Bianca she rocked because she got rid of satan’s baby. Oops. Of course if Lena had overheard Bianca say she wanted to become a coke whore in Prague or paint her toenails with the blood from a thousand tortured men I’m sure she would have been all for that as well. She just signed a contract to stay on the show but there are only 2 Lebanese in town, what else has she got to do but stalk and adore Bianca?    Oh no, wait, I know. She is going to fill her days letting Kendall be a bossy shit to her. Next time you see Kendall and Lena in a business setting, replace Lena’s name with Cinderella and Kendall’s name with wicked step mother (or sister, your choice) and you’ll see.      I forgot to mention: At Adam’s house they dragged out every relative of Junior’s that could be propped up/ wasn’t MIA under the pretense that, while at sea, junior learned how to cook (something other than a crack pipe) and was going to make them all breakfast. But really it was just a reintroduction to how ½ of the town is related. So there was lots of “my uncle-brother-cousin-daddy” and  “step-grandmother-niece-half-aunt”. Very amusing.

       It's Tues again. (god it seems like this is happening all the time. Well, or, once a week at least.) On the season premiere of Aqua teen hunger force (number 1 in the hood, G) the aqua teens were spending their Tues evenings in the thinking man tavern playing trivia. That bar is in my hood! And the aqua teens went there! How easily amusing is that? So, that is plan for this Tues. It starts at 7:30. The address is 537 W Howard Ave., it's near the Decatur high school. In the episode Meat wad wanted to answer every question with "the backstreet boys". If you come I promise not to do that. (Besides, I'm old so if I felt the urge to answer every question with the name of a boy band it would be "the Osmonds". Or possibly "Hanson" but that answer wouldn't have anything to do with my age. Just the fact that I am very, very disturbed.)  Ah, the links. What the?! This link is about some mad British unproduced sitcom. It seems brilliant. Almost too brilliant to be true.  urlLink http://www.thejunkies.com/   The wacky animals. Can we ever get enough?  urlLink http://www.lostandfrowned.com/smefacts.html   My current most favorite site of all time.  urlLink http://monfrigo.plainsong.net/?id=1  I have no idea what it says as it is in French. But it's photos of the inside of some frog's fridge! The entertainment level on this one is through the roof.

       Oh my god why didn’t we think of this before?! (Ok, well, we did but the rules kept changing and either we would be parched or passed out drunk. Plus, I haven’t seen a “split screen phone conversation” in months, have you?)  I’m thinking a theme is in order (I’m all about the themes these days aren’t I?) Or, actually, a “character trait” drinking rule may be what I mean.   Every time Maria shows up and shoves her bodacious ta-tas at someone, take a drink. (What this really means is “every time Maria shows up”. Period. Because those ta-tas are automatically gonna get shoved.)  Whenever Erica a) flips her hair, b) changes her wig, or c) changes sides in the middle of and argument, take a drink.  Every time gauze is used over the lens…no, wait. That is too confusing. Just commenting on the gauze over the lens will be enough.  Every time anyone tells Kendall that they support her and think she is great or brave and strong then switches to calling her a back stabbing, greedy bitch in mid conversation, take a drink. (It’s also ok to take a drink if this is reversed and they start out calling her a bitch then switch to telling her she’s great.)   Whenever Aiden mentions that he saw David pouring scotch into a potted plant, finish your beverage completely. (You may think you’ve heard the last of this. You haven’t. There will be a trial. There will be flashbacks. There will be sweeps.)  Every time Ryan takes his shirt off, leave the room for more cheese or another beverage or to smoke or to go to the bathroom. If he is also doing pushups, do all of the above.  Whenever you can see Boyd’s lip liner line, take a drink.  When Maggie opens her mouth and the stupidest shit imaginable comes out, take a drink. If she ever says anything relevant or profound, quit drinking for the remainder of the episode. (Trust me, this will never happen.)  When Juan Pablo speaks, mute the TV, re dub his lines, then take a drink.  Are we drunk yet? I mean, I’m feeling a bit woozy and I’m just writing the stuff   If any of the following people are involved in a slap fight, a cat fight or even some hair pulling, take  several  drinks-Greenlee, Kendall, Lena, Anna (shut up, I know she’s gone, it’s  my  fantasy), Maggie, Bianca, Maria, Liza. (I am seriously obsessed with girl fights these days. What is my damage? Jeez.)   If anyone at all has a particularly amusing or clever line and at least one person watching the episode laughs out loud, take a drink.   When Michael shows up in undead zombie mode (are undead and zombie repetitive?) take a drink. (Trust me, he will be back. There will be Halloween. There will be bad dreams. There will be sweeps)   Even though they’ve forced Mary down, she’s not out yet. She still has the most amazing insults, at least 4 per scene. Whenever she gets a good one off, drink up.  When Opal swoops into a scene sporting some atrocious get up (which is always), drink up. But if for some unfortunate reason she and Mary ever have another cat fight, game over. Turn the TV off and go read a book or something.   If anyone ever arrests, slaps or insults Simone or Mia, take a drink. (Again with the slapping)  If we ever get the truth as to what happened the night Michael disappeared, finish off the bottle, flask, six pack etc. of whatever you’re drinking.  At the end of the episode you are watching, weep drunkenly for Anna being gone.

       Greetings all, Many of you are not used to getting the Tues. email. That is because Vicky was sending them out and your address wasn't on her list. But she is in Ireland for 3 weeks and I am sending them out during that time and your address is on my list. After 3 weeks you won't get them anymore. Or, if your name was added to this list in error, contact me with a bugger off message.  Jeez, that was boring. Ok, on to the good stuff!  Twains, tonight, 8ish, excellent jukebox, $2 pints, Stella on tap. (Twains is in downtown Decatur.)  This 1st link is more wackiness with animals. When it first comes up it will ask you about some language translator (the site is in Japanese). Say no, it is way more amusing if you have no idea what is going on. Plus, in this day and age, who wants to download anything? You could get cooties or worms or sometimes that is how the devil gets into your computer and don't we all have enough temptations from satan anyway without the portal option? (I said portal, teehee.)  urlLink http://www.ne.jp/asahi/beetle/calcium/WANKO.html   This next link continues with my obsession with Shannon Doherty. It's a link to a site about a movie she made back in the 80s with Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt. (I'm sure many of you are big fans of Helen Hunt which is sad because once she finished up with puberty she also finished up with any acting skills she possessed. Angel dusted, Desperate lives, quarterback princess, these are all outstanding films. What women want is certainly no girls just wanna have fun. It's not even the Swiss family Robinson.) This movie was made before Shannon sold her soul to the devil, got braces or discovered the joys of having 2 eyebrows. And even with all that she was still a staggering mess. Perky looks so ugly on her, so unnatural.  urlLink http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/atkinson/470/index.html   This final link is to a young man I am considering making my next future ex husband. (Next implying that there were some before) But he seems too good to be true. Could it be fake? My favorite line is "11 ill songs, only 1 ill Mitch".   urlLink http://www.illmitch.com/

       I just watched, like, 9 or 10 episodes of AMC.  What a load of scenery chewing fun! So, here’s an update.  Please take note, there are some new cast members in need of nicknames and some returning cast members also in need of nicknames. Babe will be known as “that slutty cow” or “Bessy the whore”. The monobrowed lunkhead now working for the cops will be known as “Tarzan of the ADAs”. Brooke is back (my sister really dislikes her but I cannot find out why. “She sucks” isn’t specific enough-duh, they all suck). So for the time being I am going to go with “thyroid condition mommy” (her eyes bulge out).  Greenlee, Carlos and the mouth breather are all laid up in the hospital. Carlos and Greenlee got run over by a car and the mouth breather had an overdose. Of insecticide. Teehee. Since there are 3 cast members in the hospital that means it’s just been one big parade of freaks through there. Maria keeps slinging her bodacious ta-tas all around (which is nice) but the mouth breather keeps kissing her. I find this highly disturbing. Did they used to date or something? I must have missed the explanation of why she doesn’t slug the crap out of him. Simone beat Mary up simply for being her fantastically evil self (yeah the squeak toy beat up Cruella DeVil, it was pretty funny) and everybody got new highlights, product and haircuts. Except Bianca. She needs to get a new ‘do soon, she is starting to look like Laura Ingalls the time she got a high fever, wandered off and started talking to god.  Juan Poopie is less offensive now that he has a new haircut and is being “serious brother protector from the mob stud” as opposed to “I am a smarmy, smirking, Greenlee’s face licking man whore”.    Greenlee woke up with a broken arm and facial bruises thinking she was back to the future. She made out with the mouth breather (before he overdosed but after he had already been making out with Kendall-I think) before coming to her senses. Where’s Edmund slash Huey Lewis when we need a rousing rendition of the Back to the Future theme song? Carlos woke up, barely, because Greenlee was groping him. (haha Juan Poopie! You’ve been begging him to wake up for days and all it took was Greenlee sliding her hand up his gown.) The mouth breather (sadly) woke up and jumped with both feet back into his pissy ways.   Bianca got a sonogram, Kendall found it and the fest began. Kendall was actually jumping up and down she was so excited that now there is an heir to the make-up fortune. And the mouth breather can bugger off. But of course Bianca, being the retarded tree-hugging lesbian that she is, wants no part of this plan. Well duh. More secrets mean more reasons for me to get to chug beer during later episodes. Then Erica shows up while Kendall and Bianca are having a scream fest and joins in. Except Bianca mostly tears up and or stares at her shoes. It was still a fine show, Kendall and Erica can seriously throw down. So Kendall finally leaves and Lena shows up. Erica kisses her ass (which was weird) and splits. Bianca and Lena still do not make out or even shake hands but Bianca did send Lena off with a message of hope (or some horseshit) for Kendall.     But Lena cannot deliver the message because Kendall’s been arrested! For killing Michael! Teehee, right.  This huge support mob descends on the jail house. Lena, Maggie, Bianca, Aiden, Jack, mouth breather. It’s a big ol’ love in for Kendall. Mean cop and Tarzan of the ADAs are poking at Kendall and then even Bianca pitches a little fit. Lena takes the rap and they toss her in the pokie. Really, it’s actually very disturbing how ill trained and how poorly bad cop, Tarzan of the ADAs and Jackson do their jobs. Lena and Bianca did a little groping back in the cell. That was nice but it’s probably a trick.  Mary is trying to frame that slutty cow to please Adam but it doesn’t seem to be working out which makes no sense. I mean, Junior, Jamie and slutty cow have about 16 brain cells between them and Mary has dozens plus she is older, more attractive and way more evil.  Simone is trying to get Tad to like her like her and not just be a booty call. (btw, Tad has been to the tanning bed and he looks way better.) Mia likes Aiden but he is still stalking Kendall. Reggie likes pizza with his daddy but Greenlee is a big baby and is ruining it for him what with her princess attitude and broken arm. Stupid white sister!  Maria thinks Juan Poopie is a loser (get in line sister), Brooke has a daughter who is mentally challenged and has been getting dating advice from slutty cow. Which is wrong on so many levels but the main level is that the kid is, like, 5 or something.  Since meat hook Michael bit it there hasn’t been nearly enough alcohol consumption taking place. Oh sure, Adam, Palmer, Tad and Opal were slinging around some scotch and I saw Mia with a six pack but  really . Unless they are at the police station they need to have a glass of something in their hands. The dock, the campus, the hospital, homes, condos, apartments, private jets, airports, offices, secret passageways, these are all perfectly acceptable.

       And the learning just keeps on coming. I guess since the old stuff I learned keeps falling out of my head, I have more room for the new stuff. So it all works out for the best. 10 things I learned this week.  1. Painting your fingernails in the morning meeting is just as unacceptable as banging you head on the table to signify “bored now”. 2. To calculate celsius degrees to fahrenheit degrees you double the celsius number then add 30. Example: Today in Edinburgh it’s 9 degrees celsius. 9x2+30=48 degrees fahrenheit. (It’s snowing there too by the way. Wacky Scotland) 3. Women are stupid. (Yeah, I already knew this but whoa to me every time I forget for 10 minutes.) And I’m beginning to suspect we’re all insane as well. 4. Little boy’s pajama bottoms make excellent winter leggings. And the pre teen patterns are so much more festive than anything you could find in the adult department. 5. Cats think bubble light reflections are bugs that need to be toyed with, killed and then eaten. 6. There’s an entire new season of AbFab out there! Saffy has a baby, Eddy has a tanning bed installed, Patsy baby-sits. Drunken British mayhem ensues.   7. Learn to appreciate hangovers. If it were all fun and games every jackass would be doing it. 8. Before she was on AMC Greenlee was in a workout video with Marky Mark and the funky bunch. Yo yo, Greenlee, feel the vibration. 9. The Smithsonian traveling display of metal lunchboxes will be at the Atlanta International museum of art and design starting January the 8th. The opening night reception begins at 6p.m. A cocktail party for lunchboxes. Cool. 10. A four-year-old princess  does not  need to know all the words to “loser” by Beck. Santa Claus is watching you  and  the princess and everybody’s getting a spanking if the princess gets kicked out of pre school for singing “soy un perdedor I’m a loser baby so why don’t you kill me” repeatedly.

       1. ‘Tis the season. However, a wounded chipmunk let loose under the Christmas tree is not in any way a present. Or appropriate. Or festive. 2. When I was 8 my sisters and I thought it was big fun to play under the Christmas tree. Shoving, hair pulling, giggling, you know-play. “Girls, get away from the tree” was a jolly holiday chant. Not so much big fun anymore with 2 cats slapping each other, kicking the presents and knocking Elvis ornaments to the floor. Hmmm, I’ll let you know when the kitty pot pies are all cooked up. 3. Remember on Get Smart when Max would be holding a cup of coffee and then look at his watch and pour the coffee down his shirt? Yeah, really  not funny  at all in reality. Especially before 8a.m. And not even if it isn’t coffee but icy cold soda. 4. I found out it rarely snows in the city of Vancouver and the temperature is similar to ours (more rain though). That means when I go in February I can take my 11 inch mini kilt. Excellent! Maybe the Canadians will appreciate that show. ( you  people certainly don’t. you know who you are.)   5. This month there is a hockey game in the Kingdom of Fife between the Fife flyers and the Bracknell bees. Hockey is a sporting event and therefore not interesting but wouldn’t a Bracknell bees sweatshirt be really cool? 6. If the alarm goes off at 7 a.m. and a song is playing that you must know the name of, get up and immediately call the radio station. 2 snooze button slaps later is too late. (6 months in a leaky boat by Split Enz covered recently and brilliantly by….??, sigh, I’ll never know.) 7. I knew that before she slayed vampires Sarah Michelle Gellar chewed the scenery as Kendall Hart on All my Children. What I  didn’t  know was that she won an emmy for it.  Wow . I wonder if the current Kendall could slay a vampire? 8. On AMC, again with that crap, Liza and Mia are sisters. Wha? (Probably half sisters, er, half wits, but  still .) I also learned that Liza pushed Mia out of a 3-story window several years ago. You can’t really blame her though. She had a brain tumor at the time. And it is a soap opera. And Mia has rocks for brains. 9. Suicidal tendencies and Iggy Pop make outstanding “wake up and get ready for work” music. It may sound depressing but it’s really very refreshing.  10. Here where I work we have a room called the hot box. The techs test outdoor modem units (or something) from Arizona and possibly Spain for withstanding high temperatures.   The hot box  is not  a tanning bed  A Barbie would become warped in 4.5 minutes and a puddle of perky goo in 32 minutes  An action figure (say, a new kid on the block) would warp in 9.3 minutes and become a puddle of boy band goo in 49 minutes  Other exciting things that would melt in the tanning bed. Em, hot box. I meant the hot box. Hard cheese, super bouncing balls, peeps, CDs, colored chalk, disposable lighters   Things that will smoke and then explode into flame in the hot box. Barbie’s Malibu swim suit, Barbie’s hair, boxes of rice crispies, boxes of cracker jacks, wigs, fire works that you thought were duds but kept anyway because they were so large and you never know when you might need all that gun powder inside.  Please note that all melting, warping, smoking and exploding times and information are estimations by the techs and now I am never, ever allowed near the hot box unsupervised. Make that never, ever, ever period. Just because I had a few well thought out, specific questions, jeez.

       Aires-March 19-April 18 Me me me me me me me! Arrogant and domineering. It’s a wonder Aires doesn’t need a wheelbarrow to cart around that giant head filled with unbridled ego. The sign of the ram. As in, “I’m going to ram my brilliant idea down your throat.”  Celebrity Aires: Shannon Doherty     Taurus-April 19-May 19 Stubborn and plodding. Sappy sentimentalists prone to hissy fits. Conservative dolts. You’ve not seen anything until you’ve seen a Taurus pitch one. Celebrity Taurus: Tori Spelling    Gemini-May 20-June 19 Fickle and restless, the Gemini never shuts up. Scatterbrained twits filled with unemotional logic. The sign of the twins. As in, “This single space occupied by two. Oh yeah, and I’m bi-polar. Go figure.” Celebrity Gemini: Jewel  Cancer-June 20-July 21 Sensitive pouty butts. Fond of emotional manipulation and vindictiveness.  “You’ve gone and hurt my widdle feelings and now my lip is stuck so far out it will take you 3 days of total ass kissing to fix it you hateful prate you.” Celebrity Cancer: Courtney Love    Leo-July 22-August 21 “Hi, I’m a Leo. Look at my breasts. They are truly magnificent. See how the world revolves around me in all my glory? Of course you do. You have my permission to start worshipping me now. Do it. I rock.”  Celebrity Leo: Delta Burke  Virgo-August 22-September 21 Picky and critical. Slapping that sensible smirk off of their repressed faces would be pointless as the Virgo would only take this as a sign that they are, as always, justifiably correct.  Their asses are so tight the jewelry manufacturers might want to consider the Virgo a quick source of turning coal into diamonds. Celebrity Virgo: Shelly Long      Libra-September 22-October 21 “Hi, I’m a Libra. Can’t we all just get along?” Big loads of fickle and indecisive hand wringing with this lot of tree hugging peaceniks. Celebrity Libra: Sharon Osborne   Scorpio-October 22-November 20 Dead serious pack of emotionally repressed buggers. Everything’s either black or white for the Scorpio. Subtle manipulation is a favorite method of operation.  Celebrity Scorpio: Hillary Clinton  Sagittarius November 21-December 20 The saviors of the zodiac.  Oh, not your savior, just a Jesus complex in general. They flit, they float, they suffer from a severe case of foot in mouth disease.  Celebrity Sagittarius: Sinead O’Connor  Capricorn-December 21-January 19 Capricorn came out of the womb as domineering, egotistical 45-year-olds.  “Hi, I’m a Capricorn and I’m stubborn and pragmatic. Pragmatic, that means I have the social skills of a chew toy. And, as an added bonus, I have all the emotions of a robot.” Celebrity Capricorn: Susan Lucci     Aquarius-January 20-February 18 Impatient and temperamental, the Aquarius is wacky in an eccentric way that borders on insane. The mad scientists of the Zodiac. Celebrity Aquarius: Yoko Ono   Pisces-February 19-March 18 Remember that movie about that girl that had, like, 12 different personalities? Sybil? Yeah, consider Pisces the Sybil of the zodiac. All the fine attributes of the other 11 signs rolled into one psycho head case.  Celebrity Pisces: Liza Minelli

       I was seriously considering throwing an anti superbowl party. Then I seriously considered just how much I don’t give a flip and decided against it. I mean, those of us who don’t like football, we’re a small, disturbed, antisocial lot and prefer enjoying our anti superbowl activities without fanfare. Me, I’ll probably have a Buffy fest or a charmed marathon whilst painting my nails. And drinking beer (duh). But absolutely no chili or hot wings (standard football viewing consumables, so I’ve been told) because, yuck. Hey, and you know those people who say, “Oh I don’t care about the game I just enjoy watching the commercials or the half time show or both.”? Yeah, I don’t even want to go into their issues. Commercials?  Good lord.  Anyway, back about a gazillion years ago, before I gave up trying to pass myself off as considerate and easy going, I agreed to attend a superbowl party. I was told there would be a movie shown for the non-football-caring humans who were coming. The movie turned out to be Jerry Maguire. Now how was I supposed to choose between the lesser of those two evils? “But doesn’t Renee Zellweger cancel out Tom Cruise?” you might be thinking. No, she does not. Throw in that melon headed creepy kid and Cuba Gooding jr. and she so cannot redeem it. There would have to be, like, 30 people that rock in a movie with Tom Cruise for it not to blow. (Ok, Legend was a good movie but Tom was nothing more than a prop really and it had the lord of darkness, fairies and he was sporting a mullet. In fact, I believe Tim Curry referred to him at one point in the movie as “that mulleted fairy “. Or, perhaps not.)  I think I ended up getting drunk and mocking every one at the party, every one in the movie and everyone at the superbowl.  In that order.   Show me the money, jeez. Show me projectile vomiting. Oh! I just remembered another lovely superbowl party incident. This happened about four years ago, before I stopped trying to pass myself off as a delight to spend time with. “Let’s go to this great superbowl party, we’ll only stay a few minutes”, and “lots of amusing people will be there” were grunted at me as I was being shoved into the car. So, now, what part of an hour and a half with a room full of non alcohol consuming, mullet sporting, diet coke-heads staring at the screen like beady eyed, slack jawed lumps witnessing the second coming constitutes “great”, “a few minutes”, and/or “lots of amusing people”? Yes,  exactly.    “I’m worth a million in prizes”-Iggy Pop   I was blasting this a teensy bit too loud and blew out one of my speakers yesterday so I thought this an appropriate quote. And also,  obviously , I am.

       Last night I watched an AMC marathon. Well, 3 episodes but still, its Kendall’s trial.  How very.  The Pine Valley court system is a travesty, a travesty I say! Of justice that is. But not of fashion. So here’s a little court reporting, Valerie style. Bianca is finally looking fake/real pregnant. And who else but an anorexic, pregnant lesbian with a neurotic mother could pull off sideways, giant polka dots? Goldy Hawn circa 1968, maybe. Kendall is finally looking fake/fake pregnant. Her court wear was classic though.  Very Patty McCormick, 1956, bad seed. Greenlee, Mia and Simone wanted to feel Kendall up in the back room of the courthouse.  Sweet.   What’s with the judge? I’m scared. Why does Reggie get to come to court in his rap master clothes? Put that child in a suit, how cute would that be? Boyd has a new haircut and a new shade of lipstick. Both very feminine. I wonder if he is secretly wearing a Fusion color.  Mouth breather, Juan Poopie and Tad all have new haircuts. All very bad. But ok, bonus: Tad spent his holiday in the tanning bed. Babe’s channeling Brittany Spears and Krystal is channeling Daisy Duke. But not the Daisy from the ‘79/’80 series. The Daisy from the ’97 reunion show. Ew. What’s a cubra Libra? Apparently Lena fell down. She got a little rip in her sweater.   Maggie! Root touch up sweetie, trust me. Six weeks growth equal depth. Any longer and hello white trash. I’m not really interested in seeing Michael Cambais without his blue, icicle dripping, meat hook dragging makeup. Climbing out of the dump like a really sterile version of Carrie was a nice touch though. Ok, now Tad seems way  too  tan. He’s looking like Ross in a particularly wacky episode of friends.   What floor is the courtroom on? If it’s above the 3rd maybe Greenlee could shove Mia out the window. Simone could help. It would sure liven things up a bit.  Hi Mia? Yeah, you’re no Brooke Shields. Get your eyebrows waxed.   Long, detailed speech by Kendall’s lawyer about Michael being frozen, then unfrozen, then frozen, on a meat hook. In a meat packing plant. Yeah!   Sadly, Krystal saw the parent trap. She’s no Haley Mills. And Tad? Also not Haley Mills. Hell, together they couldn’t even be Maureen O’Hara. Ladies, ladies, stop acting as if mouth breather is a winner and or the savior. He’s a creepy loser. Notice how I couldn’t be bothered to mention Maria, her bodacious ta-tas and the whole Huey Lewis is in a coma story line? Uh huh,  exactly.

       I'm still exhausted from my travels so all I can work up is a rant about the Salt Lake airport. Tonight, Twains, 8pm.  I got to spend four hours in the Salt Lake City airport on Thursday evening because I missed my original connecting flight. So, I thought that would be the perfect opportunity to be accosted by Mormons. After all, who needs saving more than I do? I was sorely disappointed. Not a single Mormon tried to change my evil ways! I was sucking down caffeine, beer and cigarettes at the speed of light and sporting a band-aid the size of a candy bar above my eye. Surely a sign of some disturbing domestic abuse or sordid life style, right? (The reality is lame. Apparently relatives of Delta employees are not allowed visible piercings in odd places. But the Mormons couldn't possibly know that.) And then there was my extra fine outfit, like one big, giant sign screaming "I'm on the highway to hell."   I guess they don't have any geriatric Mormon recruiters because if they did I'd be telling a very different tale now.    I also expected to hear the Osmonds blaring at top volume out of the speakers but the closest I got was Supertramp muzak. I learned later the beer in Utah is only 3% alcohol by volume or some such lameness. That would explain why it took 6 pints on an empty stomach to reach cruising altitude. I figured I could purchase obscure Orson Scott Card books too but out of 4 books stores all they had was speaker for the dead. Bollix to the bloody Mormons! You think they'd be pushing him harder than the golden tablets of god. Or whatever.  Oh yes, and the duty free shop? A travesty to international flights everywhere.

       It's the last Tuesday Vicky and Deb will be celebrating as singles! The next Tuesday we get together we'll be hearing things like, " My old lady  took her girl scout troop to the circus", and " My old lady  got a Sunnydale high class ring because our spaz friend Valerie keeps flaunting hers". Yes, just exactly like that.  Because here in the south that is the proper way to refer to ones' wife. It's what we do (I hope those of you with wives already are writing this down). Twains, 8p.m. If I left anybody off the email list, oh well.  No wait, em, I meant to say, forward this to them (...stupid disregard for social skills). But not if they suck (...rude disregard for social skills).   Big time linkage fun  urlLink http://www.nopantsday.com/     (Andrea 90210 in particular will find this amusing. If only because she's so fond of yelling at me to go put some on.)   urlLink http://www.kirstenjohnson.com/touchy.html     Seriously brilliant yet disturbed Canadian artist. She's based in Toronto but I am hoping to find one of her calendars in Vancouver.     urlLink http://www.mrbrainsfaggots.com/     I've sent this to some of you before but because I'm 10 years old it never stops being funny.   urlLink http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/howmuchinside.html    Fascinating and educational.      Buffy: "There you go, and I double-sized it for ya."  Xander: "Oh, thank you!"  Buffy: "And cut way back on the cat."  Xander: (mouth full) "CAT?!"  Buffy: "Just kidding.

       Ah February, the month of love. But we know what you really want. Look to your horror scope to see if you’ll get laid this valentine’s day.  Aries: Oh, you will. You really won’t enjoy it though because, after all, no one’s as good as you.  Taurus: Yes, after much whining and begging. Then you’ll decide you’re in love. Let the stalking begin.  Gemini: You’d really like to but it isn’t going to happen for you. Too bad, if you weren’t so fickle you’d see action, it’s standing right next to you. Twit.  Cancer: Yes, you’ll get laid. After weeks of manipulation and pouting you’ll manage to pull off some mighty fine guilt sex.  Leo: Multiple times with various people. They won’t enjoy it but that’s really not an issue is it? You’ll have a great time.   Virgo: Nope, none for you. You almost will but then, what with all the exact directions you’re giving, your partner gives up. Who cares though? If they can’t follow a few simple instructions, why bother?  Libra: You will but you’re really not interested. It just seems easier that way. You’ll be wracked with guilt over the whole experience.  Scorpio: Yes. Get naked. Lie down. Get busy. Get done. Do not repeat.  Sagittarius: Almost. But then you have to go and point out that unattractive thing on your partner and that pretty much kills the mood.  Capricorn: “Valentine’s day is a contrived holiday foisted onto the unsuspecting public to sell goods and services during a slow shopping season.” So saith the Capricorn.  Aquarius: Yes, quickly and bizarrely. Then you’ll publish a dissertation on the oddities of your partner and the whole experience in general.          Pisces: Oh, you bet. By humans residing in this dimension, plane or planet? Well, that’s anybody’s guess.

       Laying in the street Translation: Drinking and general silliness in a bar. If you’re at home or at your friends’ home it’s called laying in the driveway. The driveway part Vicky gets credit for. (Yeah, I know it should be lying. But that’s not what it’s called.)  Off his/her leash	 Translation: Some small child is running free in public. Usually followed by mishap then tears. Also works for adults who are recently single, currently unsupervised, etc.  Those pants are unfortunate Translation: Those pants are hideous and you are not cool. Also works for hairstyles, shoes, etc. Stolen from Deb   That’s just crazy talk Translation: Your opinion varies wildly from mine. I’ve heard this everywhere. When I was a kid, on TV, etc.		  At least I’m not out robbing liquor stores 	Translation: Justification for something colossally moronic I’ve just done.  I’m just five minutes away Translation: I’m really seven to forty-five minutes away depending on how lost I am now, how lost I’m about to become and how many times I need to stop and pee.  Where you going in those pants, 1984? Translation: Those pants are outdated and I am mocking your wardrobe. Any article of clothing, or hairstyle, and any year will work. Stolen from Friends.  I see your mom let you dress yourself this morning	 Translation: More mocking of your wardrobe.     Have you been drinking?  Translation: You’ve just suggested something insane. Much more amusing if they clearly have not been drinking.  If they have been drinking then the correct response is, “quite a bit actually.” Response stolen from Buffy.  Monkey Translation: Infant or child  Delinquent Translation: Teenager	  Toddlers Translation: young women just old enough to drink. You are not cool. Nor are you hip or happening.  Where’s Heather going?	Translation: Where’s insert name here going? Stolen from Heathers and, more recently, from Deb. It’s especially annoying and amusing if the persons’ name is actually Heather.    What’s your damage? Translation: What’s your problem jackass? Stolen from Heathers.   Stagger	 Translation: Walk  The Royal we Translation: I’ve just been included in something I’m sure I don’t want to be involved in. “When we arrive we are going to be nice and act right.” “You must mean the royal we because  I will not  be doing those things.”  Act Right Translation: I really have no idea what this means  I have no response to that Translation: OK. Uh huh. All right. Indicates I am actually listening to your story but I’m not invested enough (and by invested I mean interested) to make any opinions at this time. Or, on rare occasions, it means the opinion I have of what you’ve just said would get me smacked in the mouth if I actually voiced it.  Is it difficult or time consuming?	Translation: You’ve just asked me to do something. It’s a rude response that implies that I’m an obnoxious, lazy cow and it was stolen from Buffy.  And this concerns me how? Translation: Your story is long and I’m loosing interest fast. Get to the part where you ask for my help so I can ask if it’s difficult or time consuming or go get me another drink.  Hopped up on Translation: Acting all wacky and jumpy cause you’ve had too much sugar, red dye, caffeine, endorphins, liquor etc. Back in the day it was used exclusively for drug use but that’s just boring.  You’re pretty. Wanna make out?	Translation: Stolen from Angel and it’s really just about being the most inappropriate thing to say.  Vibrating with health Translation: You’ve just put something in your body that makes you feel immediately better.  Like spinach, Guinness, chicken soup, etc. You pervs, I know what  you  were thinking. McKenna got it from a Thai restaurant review and I stole it from her.     Challenged Translation: Added to the end of stuff to explain shortcomings. I am “directionally challenged” and “time management challenged”. Someone I know gets called, “pop culturally challenged” but it’s not true, her old lady is wrong. All of you are “attention span challenged”.    	 The music of my people	Translation: Vicky said this to me a while back as I was squealing over some Kid Rock song. And it made perfect sense. White trash, me, Kid rock. Yep, the music of my people. It works with anything, not just music and it’s the perfect way to work pop culture into your ancestral back ground. “The pop tarts of my people.” “The beer of my people.”       And all that that implies	Translation: It just sounds menacing. “I talked to Heather this morning and all that that implies.” Hmm, was there more than talking going on? Has Heather joined a coven? Was there any hairpulling? It evils up the most mundane statements. Stolen from the Iron Giant  Piffle Translation: Trivial. Inept. God, I love Spike.   Don’t go Translation: Don’t go  Grab ass Translation: Unfortunately this sounds like something wrong. It isn’t, it’s just silly. When I was a kid this is what would ensure every time my dad pulled out the camera. “Girls, stop with the grab ass for five seconds so I can get a decent picture!” So now we have tons of pictures where one sister is crying, the other looks like she just got goosed (cause she did) and me sporting an evil smirk.  The fine game of grab ass hasn’t lost its appeal now that we’re adults either. No more tears just lots of pushing, shoving and mayhem. My nephew has taken it to a whole new level by incorporating prat falls into the scenario. It’s making a come back. I hear it on TV all the time. Not just for families any more, fun to play with your friends too.  I see it’s obvious day at camp stupid Translation: Duh. Stolen from the Aqua teen hunger force. Haven’t heard me say this? Get ready, it’s number one with a bullet.  While I don’t so much use the following phrases as hear them, I still decided to include them. Because, you know, more with the funny.  It’s not you, it’s me Translation: It is  so, completely  you  We should just be friends Translation: You are highly entertaining. Sadly, you are still a troll. Never touch me because I cannot afford therapy until I’m a hundred.  What is wrong with you?! Translation: doesn’t really need a translation but the answer is clearly and always, “ everything .”

       I’d better tell you all about this before it “dissipates” from my memory. But be warned it probably falls under the category of “way more amusing while it was actually taking place than here, now, in print.” Or maybe it’s the “It seemed like a good idea at the time” category which happens to be a specialty of mine. In Vancouver (oh god just when we thought she’d finally tired of her Kingdom of Fife stories she up and visits yet another country for a whole new batch of wacky, foreign high jinks.) liquor stores are, apparently, places of great worth not to be strewn about 17 to a block like, say, a starbucks.  They are special, secret places that need to be kept out of the reach of boozehounds, tourists, Americans…wait, those are all the same. Let’s just go with “undesirables”.  I saw three the entire time I was there and I was  really searching . And one of those was something called a “wine cellar” which nobody cares about so that doesn’t even count bringing the total down to two. Lots of the pubs and bars sell six packs of beer known as “off license” or some such crap. On Sunday we decided this was our best option for procuring beer and I was dragged along to be the procuree as the role(s) of driver and amused passengers had already been filled. And also, mostly, because I was the one yelling about how five beers were certainly not enough for any self-respecting American boozehound tourist which is all we had left from our traumatizing search for a liquor store. So, a fist full of cash is shoved at me and I’m booted out the car. “What  kind  of beer should I get”, I whine. “Just get some and hurry the hell up, we’ll be parked down the block, with the motor running!” they grunt (or giggle, depending).  I’m not sure I can describe how truly bizarre this place, this off license pub was, but here goes. Imagine the bingo room at the local VFW circa 1956, crossed with the demon bar on Buffy sans the pool tables. Lots of cheesy, fake wood paneled walls and industrial carpeting soaked in beer every night for the last 200 years, (which, I believe, is how long this place has been in business.) Oddest of all is a giant room, in the middle of the room, made all of glass. In it are 3 or 4 couples doing nothing more exciting than drinking beer. There’s no smoking allowed in doors so neither the people in the glass room nor the people in the bar are smoking and clearly everyone in the place has been a regular since 1981 at the latest. I’m  still  trying to figure the glass room out.  I stagger up to the bar and ask the fine (and by fine I mean surly as hell) French bartender for beers. As he reaches for a glass I tell him I need beers to go and ask if this is where I can get them. He grunts in the affirmative. “Uhhhhh, what beers do you have? You know, to go.” I say. (Great, now I’m Forrest Gump) As his eyes roll back so far in his head that I can no longer see the pupils, he snatches open the door to a mini fridge behind the bar. I can see four kinds of beer, all in cans with one choice being Budweiser. I’ve no idea what the other three are so to buy time while I’m making this important decision I say, “Uhhhhh, where’s the bottled beers?” (Great, now I’m Bevis)   “That’s all we got” snarls Pierre, still sans pupils. Luckily there’s a waitress standing there enjoying my idiocy and she finally speaks up with, “Are you from the states honey?” (Because I so  very clearly  am.) “Well them two beers is a malted beverage and it’s really an acquired taste (malt liquor, check. No, don‘t want that) and if you don’t want the Bud I’d suggest you take the Kokonee.” “I’ll take it!” I squeal to Pierre who is now using the opened mini fridge door to prop up his bored, vitamin deficient carcass.  I pay, grab my wacky beer and haul ass back to the car where I share this story to the gleeful, snickering delight of the rest of the party. I’ve never been in an opium den but I imagine if you changed the word opium to beer, it would be exactly like this experience. The beer tasted like Coors light, which is still better than malt liquor.  Vicky is in California and Deb has to work so I don’t think I can be bothered to go to Twains tonight. If any of you wants to hang out with me specifically, you know how to reach me. Otherwise there is an All my children marathon calling my name. (Sure, I’m pathetic. Why don’t you just call me up and tell me that, smarty pants)                Oh yeah, A Broad, we drank the alcoholic tang you left the other night and we are really sorry we mocked you now because it was very tasty. You will still be mocked in the future (you all will so don’t be acting all smug like A Broad is the only one to suffer the mocking) but for things other than drinking alcoholic tang.

       While in Vancouver a group of us decided to visit Grouse mountain. (The only way to reach the top was via the sky bucket of death but that's a different story.) There's lots of snow centered activities there including, but not limited to, shopping and drinking. After the shopping but before the drinking we decided to take a sleigh ride. Our snow bunny guide gave us a little speech before we pulled out beginning with, "Hi! I'm Buffy* and I'll be your sleigh master today!" So I turn to the rest of the group and go, "Shouldn't that be sleigh-er?" Lots of giggling ensued and Deb says she was thinking the exact same thing and everybody got it because we are all big geeks but because I said it out loud does that make me the biggest geek of all?  *Not her real name but I changed it for the story because, duh.  Hey, it turns out I didn't really blow out my speaker blasting Iggy Pop. The speaker just needed a nap or something because I was blasting the backstreet boys this weekend and it woke back up. How disturbing is that?  Apparently god loves cheese as much as we do.  urlLink http://poizenideas.com/cheesus/   Ok, so it's all just a ploy to get us to love Richard Cheese. But really, we should be doing that anyway.  Come to Twains tonight if you'd like a babbling, disturbed explanation of where this quote came from. (or, really, I don't care. Email me if you'd rather.)  DRUGGED GIRL: (to Faith) "Hey, you're pretty. You wanna make out?"

       I have a traffic question. Does the "slower traffic keep right" rule apply on 5 lane surface streets? Specifically Lawrenceville hwy. The middle lane is for turning left, the far right lane is for turning right, leaving the other lane for those of us who are not  crack smoking, geriatric, narcoleptics. (For those of you in Scotland, please disregard the traffic question and enjoy a 20 year old photo of Jackie and I.) I've recently given up on the interstate as a viable option for driving to work as it's become a parking lot. And it isn't as if I'm stressed about being late to work (If I'm on time for anything it's either that someone else is in charge, there was a wacky mix up in the daylight savings time thing or it's a lucky break), it's just that I like to drive places faster than  14 miles per hour !  What part of fast lane equals sleepy time in this country?! It's supposed to get cold again tonight. 44 degrees cold. ew! It's almost May, what is going on? I thought I was done with the putting on of the pants until winter. Stupid cold.   I recently read an article in a British magazine that said both Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia) and Sarah Gellar (Buffy) were up for the role of wonder woman in the movie. What was funny was at the end the writer suggested the way to decide who got the role was to have them partake in nude lime jello wrestling. (teehee, the Brits rock!)   I don't have enough tee shirts for all the great one liners. Guess I'll have to start putting them across the back of my underwear. (and by start I'm implying I haven't been doing this already.) 10 more.  10) It’s all fun and games until someone loses a tooth. Then it’s hockey. 09) The only normal people are the ones you don't know very well. 08) We have enough youth- How about a fountain of smart? 07) Organized people are just too lazy to look for things. 06) Age and treachery will triumph over youth and skill. 05) Not now. I’m working the room. 04) Am I getting smart with you? How would you know? 03) Prepare to bow before my invincible irony and sarcasm. 02) The meaning of life? You’re looking at it.  01) I appeal to a small, select group of confused people.   Somebody told me they enjoyed last weeks' movie reviews but they were disappointed because the specific movie(s) weren't mentioned. This week, personal attacks! Different reviewer, same level of surly and surlier. Piffle, Valerie Krustyburger manager: "We need more secret sauce. Put this mayonnaise in the sun."  Marge: "Homer, is this how you pictured married life?"  Homer: "Yeah, pretty much, except we drove around in a van solving mysteries."  -The Simpsons

       Short of being attached to the bumper of a pickup truck by a cock ring and being dragged around the "great" state of Texas, I can't think of anything more painful than watching "The Sweetest Thing," which signals the end of Cameron Diaz's sanity, if not her career.  As far as I'm concerned, a great career move for Matthew Lillard would be decapitation.  Does anybody want to see Norm Macdonald in anything? At all? I'd like to see somebody toss him into the gorilla cage at the zoo and see how funny he can be. He screams "actor" with the same conviction with which Richard Simmons screams "straight."  It appears that James Van Der Beek has spent the post-Dawson's Creek years receiving electroshock therapy.  In "Mr. Wrong," director Nick Castle combines two things that don't go together: romantic comedy and an episode of Bugs Bunny. After directing this and the awful "Major Payne," I think Nick should be required to sit in on all the screenings of his next movie and take questions afterward, such as this one: "Can I beat the shit out of you in the parking lot, or should we get it over with here?"  Vertical Limit: . Climb, climb, climb, avalanche, climb, climb, Nitro-Glycerin explosion, climb, climb, awful dialogue, climb, climb, helicopter, climb, climb, cool action scenes that were shown to death in the previews, climb, climb, random death, climb, climb, credits. I just saved you 7 bucks.  I've always contended that Chris O'Donnell has the screen presence of a fried egg, and his performance here has done nothing to change my mind. Also on hand to humiliate himself is the formerly reliable actor Scott Glenn, who plays a gruff old mountain man looks like he's made of burlap. But the true standout of the cast is Robin Tunney. If there is a more vacuous and vacant actress currently alive in this world, then I'm Fred Gwynne. From her roles in The Craft to End of Days to Supernova, she is consistently and irretrievably awful. In Vertical Limit, she plays a climbing expert (excuse me while I snort Pepsi out of my nose) who spends the entire movie literally freezing to death, and Tunney can't even blow a nasal snot bubble convincingly.  Whoever thought Matthew Lillard should do Shakespeare has severe brain lesions. Whoever thought Alicia Silverstone should sing on camera is on drugs I never knew existed.   I feel bad for Jean-Claude Van Damme's proctologist. If his acting is any indication, it must take a lot of time and several hydraulic tools to get that guy's ass cheeks to separate. He walks around like he's some kind of frozen treat: Jean-Claude on a stick. You could sharpen a pencil if you got close enough to jam one into his rear end. The only thing stiffer than the guy's strut is his personality, which has all the flexibility of Margaret Thatcher at a rave after five double espressos.  This film is so bad that it actually casts doubt on the significance of Dylan's music career, because anybody whose soul is full of this much pretentious bullshit would barely be able to hold his own in a karaoke bar. If you didn't know that Dylan was more full of himself than a naked Tommy Lee on a heroin binge, you're about to learn.  Now, I don't know if they were paying Isabella Miko by the word or what, but all she does is scream and run around topless at the slightest provocation. I'm not sure this qualifies as acting so much as appropriate Hollywood party behavior, which may explain how Isabella got discovered.  Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy have better chemistry than Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Besides, Zeta-Jones could give Melanie Griffith a run for the "Please Stop Acting Before I Choke on My Own Tongue" award. She plays the part like a 15-year-old who's just learned she isn't getting the Beemer for her sixteenth birthday.  I'm going to find Ted Danson and kick his ass for not beaning Shelly Long with a shot glass during "Cheers" and eliminating that particular Hollywood plague at the source. The fact that the film studios haven't figured out yet that Shelly Long shouldn't be allowed in any more motion pictures is reason enough to hope for a massive earthquake that sends Hollywood to the bottom of the ocean floor.  The Corporation seems like the brainchild of 3 movie execs who aim to conceive a movie while completely high on marijuana. How’s THIS for a recipe? ”We take The Firm, that Cruise flick that’s ripped off more often than a hotel bathrobe, mix it with something old like The Stepford Wives, throw in a few pointless sex scenes, hire one of those 90210 freaks, and get Roger Corman to sign the check! Andrew Stevens will direct. He’d direct rush hour traffic for two donuts and cab fare. Oh, and call the Mom from ET. We need someone to overact and humiliate themselves badly.” ”Which 90210 kid? The short little Michael J. Fox clone, or the tall brooding James Dean wannabe?” ”No, I was thinking that bland lifeless blonde one! The one that’s NEVER BEEN IN A MOVIE before!” ”Ian Ziering???” Does he have an agent? Does he even have a phone?”  Speaking of stupid, has anyone else noticed that Tara Reid is so artificially tan that she looks like one of the Oompah-Loompahs from "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." Her eyes appear so freakishly bright because of her unnatural skin tone that even when I close my eyes now, I can see the spots burned into my retinas.  The director of this movie is David Zucker, the guy who made "Airplane." It's hard to imagine what this guy has done to himself in the last couple of decades to become so unfunny, but my guess is that it probably involved Christian Science and LSD.  Here's the exact moment when I knew "Die Another Day," the 20th James Bond film, was going to get nuked: Madonna's cameo appearance. And it's not like the woman just walks across the screen and you say, "Oh look, its Madonna." No, she has a speaking part with actual full sentences. I don't know where the definition of "kiss of death" is in the Hollywood lexicon but "Madonna has a speaking part" is an indication that you're getting close. This woman couldn't be stiffer if she had an icicle in her rectum.   Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this film, which means twice the failure. Her direction reminded me of her acting in "Godfather 3," a performance that had every critic in America pondering whether she'd look better in a Burger King or a McDonald's uniform.   New tagline for marketing campaign: "Better than 'Gigli'!"  Forget the "Saturday Night Live" curse; how about the "Friends" curse? Death would seem a welcome release compared to a life of starring roles in such gems as "Ed", "The Pallbearer" and "Fools rush in." Memo to Matthew Perry (and all the "Friends" for that matter): more Vicadin, not less.   Putting Winona Ryder in an action thriller like "Alien" makes about as much sense as letting Marlon Brando lead a Jazzercise video. Her character is about as interesting as a pound of alien dung.  Never mind that casting Ben Affleck as a street tough and Jennifer Lopez as a lesbian stretches believability more than casting John Goodman as Peter Pan. Welcome to Hollywood and the Anne Heche-ization of lesbianism. Not only is lesbianism a transitory sexual preference, to be waved around like a Chanel purse, but it's also a great marketing tool!  I just can't emphasize enough how bad it all is. I mean, it's such a disaster it may resurrect Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs' career. He'll be able to defend himself by saying "at least I didn't make 'Battlefield Earth'," and executives will have to acknowledge that he has a point.   "Bad Boys 2" is a 150-minute life-sucking experience. It's like that scene in "The Princess Bride" where Prince Humperdink turns the machine up to "50" and sucks 50 years of Wesley's life away.   I don't know where anybody got the idea that Chris Rock could act, but the guy is making about as much progress in his new career as Corey Feldman is as a pop singer.   Since I can do no public service by discussing this film, I'd like to offer some guidelines for filmmakers who consider endeavors of this nature in the future.  1.	No more film adaptations of bad American sitcoms.  2.	Should, by some oversight, such a film adaptation be made, original cast members may not appear in them -- not even in a pathetic "hey look, that guy is still alive" cameo.  3.	If such a film lasts longer than 85 minutes, the filmmakers shall be considered to be in violation of the audience's basic human rights.  4.	Producers are prohibited from casting any of the following people in a speaking role: Tom Arnold, Jim Varney, Ed Begley, Jr., any current or former cast member from Saturday Night Live, any person who was part of the '80s Brat Pack, any member of the Sheen or Baldwin families, Fran Drescher, Florence Henderson and Shelly Long. Especially Shelly Long.  Any violation of above rules will result in the filmmaker's compulsory attendance at next year's Academy Awards ceremony, where he will have his head chopped off onstage in a gala musical tribute to mediocrity.

       If there's one earth-crackingly horrific trend in modern-day comedies, it's that mouth-breathing screenwriters think it's hilarious when Asian people or elderly people (or OMG... elderly Asian people ! Write that down!) break into some urban street slang with mumble-mouthed results. That gag has been funny precisely ONE time in the history of cinema, and that was way back in 1980. Having Chinese Granny mumble "fo shizzle mah nozzle" (or whatever) is the surest indication of a screenwriter with more cocaine than talent.  This movie is not only witless and unwatchable; it is a gaping black hole of comedy. Frankly I'm stunned that every American who paid to see it didn't file a class action suit against the now-sorta-defunct Tri-Star Pictures for their blatant misrepresentation of the word "comedy".  The best friend is played by Johnny Knoxville, whose appearance screams "walking punch line" so loud I became tense waiting for him to dive into a pile of elephant feces. Fans of legal drama may want to take note as this film contains the most idiotic courtroom scene in cinema history. Not only does the hero argue his own case and win, he employs some tactics I haven't seen since kindergarten Puppet Theater.  I'm about to devote as much review space to this movie as it deserves:  Pure. Abhorrent. Shit.  And yes; I watched the whole damn thing. How something like this gets released for public consumption makes me want to scream until my colon explodes.  Not until the day that TVs and VCRs come as standard shower features should you ever witness this witless, aimless and altogether awful piece of garbage.  If it seems weird to focus mainly on a film's nudity, it's important to remember that the Skin is the ONLY thing worth seeing in this movie. Were the nudity removed, this film would retain the entertainment value of a used tea bag.  I'd mention a few good supporting actors and a few creepy scenes that do indeed stand out, but they simply don't exist. I began to get the feeling that this was a really long music video that they decided to add dialogue to. (No offense to the word dialogue.)  The 'touching, romantic' scenes between the two principals are so poor and unconvincing, they offer the best laughs in the movie. Rarely can a movie so empty cause such annoyance.  According to the back of the DVD case, this flick has two full paragraphs worth of plot. My guess is that they wrote the DVD case first, and tried (poorly) to follow the synopsis they came up with. All I saw was three naked women rolling around on the floor. Since the word 'vampire' is in the title, the gals occasionally get some syrupy blood splattered all over 'em - and then its back to the simulated cunnilingus.  One quick word about the direction: Bad. Hey, just because you give a tripod a name, that doesn't make it a director.   Granted, they could have called this movie "Free Head!" and I don't think I'd have liked it.  The basic plot of this movie makes Three's Company look like Othello  I hope you don't brand me as over-dramatic, but I'd go out on a limb and say that this movie is quite possibly the dumbest thing to come along since the birth of Anna Nicole Smith.  I've seen bagel mold that offered more originality than this pathetically stupid film.   The action scenes are as plentiful as they are insipid and poorly photographed.        And now for some personal attacks on actors:  Martin Lawrence is not a funny man. Some could construe that comment as opinion, yet I'm as certain of this truth as I am that marijuana smells good. There are varying degrees of funniness, and Lawrence doesn't even approach the outer borders surrounding nearly close to being almost humorous - accidentally or otherwise. This guy is a bloated hack, a shrill and hate-filled fool who entertains only his extended personal posse - and those fools are being paid to laugh.  Note to cameo players:  Cameron--NEVER try to act.  Scorsese----Lay off the medication. Rob Reiner----You wear it, and it rhymes with turtle. Jennifer Tilly---um, nice boobs.  Oh, good God, what did Cindy Williams do to deserve what she's forced to do in this filth? It's uglier than any Faces of Death or Batman sequel out there, and you have to see it to believe it. Her shrill, drunk, screaming ass is all over this horrible movie, and I wonder how close she was to homelessness before signing on for this degradation.  But the true find in this movie is Johnathon Schaech. Actually, his acting talent is tougher to spot here than his name is to spell. But if they ever make a "Barbie & Ken: The Genitalia Experiment" movie, there's your Ken.  No better is the shrill, shrieking, and way over-the-top Kirstie Alley. She is a comedy vacuum, so she fits right in this joyless slop.  Angelina Jolie: She  has nothing sexy to do in this movie, unless you consider getting shot and puking blood everywhere sexy. (Hey, to each his own.) She gives the best performance of the three, although that is like saying that Curly was the most realistic of The Three Stooges.  Salma Hayak does the 'window-dressing' role again and I must say that as an actress, she really has a knack for having large breasts.  Whoever told Ethan Hawke that he could act is a cruel, cruel liar.  Basically, the gore FX seemingly make up only about 1/3 of the makeup in the movie, with the remainder going to cover up the massive Rushmore-esque melon that belongs to Karen Black. I swear - This woman looks like she applies lipstick with a paint roller.   I'm not sure if it's Cuba Gooding who chooses his own scripts, but my guess is this: he keeps every script he's ever been sent and he spreads them out all over the floor of his house. Whichever script his cat craps on first is the movie he opts to star in next.  The most entertaining performance comes from lovely young Mena Suvari, basically because she's just awful. Watching her quivery lips trying to spit out the British inflection is like watching a leech on a hot plate. I'm not saying Suvari is a poor actress; I'm just saying I've never seen her give a good performance.  Freddie Prinze Jr. is unable to portray any emotion that begins or ends in a consonant. You could set Freddie on fire, and I doubt he could adequately convey "something warm".  All reports indicate that Michael Caine signs on for specific films based solely on the catering budget.  When describing skills such as acting talent, skill of timing, and the ability to hold a scene, Claire Danes ranks right above an empty gumball machine and right below Pauly Shore covered with festering scabs.

       The current trend is homemade tee shirts. It's big time fun and excitement. I was sent a site with some excellent lines which I immediately and shamelessly absconded. My 10 favorite. 10. Do your owners know you're out without your leash? 9. A little inaccuracy sometimes saves a ton of explanation. 8. I'm not bossy I just know what you should be doing. 7. Your opinion, while interesting, is irrelevant.  6. I've stopped listening. Why haven't you stopped talking? 5. Yes. It IS always about me. 4. They say I have A.D.D. but they just don't understand. Oh look! A chicken! 3. Everyone is born right-handed. Only the gifted overcome it. 2. Has anyone ever just hauled off and hit you? (and my number one favorite because, as I was recently informed by a shouted, unanimous chorus of "fans", I  so clearly  am) 1. Narcissism-one of my many good qualities.  I collect particularly offensive lines from movie reviews all by the same reviewer. This guy is brilliant. If I could write like him, well, I'd get beaten up.  A lot . But I bet I'd also make scads of money which I could then spend on collectible Buffy action figures, cheerleader costumes,  fees for golf courses with actual golf carts and hair extensions. And all that that implies. (see attachment for some of the better ones.)  Missing all the  preservative filled mocking goodness of the little boy and girl bands from the past? I know I am! I look back fondly on the time I strapped a bottle rocket to one of my new kids on the block dolls and sent him sailing towards the ocean. (Of course I was in Destin and more than likely drunk.) And the time I got a sporty spice doll and gave it to my nephew to play with. S. Spice had that great "I dream of Jeanie" ponytail, perfect for a little boy to swing around and then launch like a perky, British, eye poking  missile.

       Still at the boathouse (Greenlee shows up to interrupt the ickyness of Kendall whoring herself to Ryan YET again)- Greenlee: “Hey, maybe Lesbianca is hiding out in the lair of the demon. Er, your moms’ place I meant to say. I didn’t go there on my own because, you know, every opportunity to check out the hotness that is you, well I’m taking it.” Kendall: “I don’t understand. And by don’t understand I mean that I do understand but we need to have the same conversation 400 times a week.” Ryan: (in a tone that would offend even Miranda) “Good thinking Greenlee. And by good I mean retarded but thanks for playing. Right now Kendall is number one but according to the scenes for tomorrow you’ll be number one then and I’ll be breathing on you. Go home and wait.”   Kendall: “Shut up frontal lobotomy. Greenlee, if Lesbianca ever has to go away to, say, a mental institution then you and I should do the whole subtext thing together. You have great eyeshadow and nice arms. Do you work out?” Greenlee: “Uh huh. (flips hair)” Kendall: (licks lips.) Ryan: (breaths with mouth open.)  Babe falls out of bed and goes night-night on the floor.  Krystal with a K stops objecting quite so loudly that Tad is a wack job for saying perhaps it was Bess that didn’t make it when she has flashbacks to some scenes where her doped up, blood fevered daughter said the same thing.  The cops show up to “help” Adam but Tad pretends he’s a doctor and that Adam is the number one loony escaped from the bin. And after much finger wagging  (cops), hair shaking (Adam), bodacious ta-tas in your face shoving (Maria) and smirking (Tad) the cops leave. Jamie, back from holiday at the Dinah Shore open, wakes Babe up from her nap. They bond. Who (whom?) is the bigger girl in that scenario?  Brooke staggers along and Tad hands her Adams’ leash. It’s not short enough if you ask me. And where the hell is Mary?! Her evil antics in all this are sorely missed. Aidan shows up. He and Tad hold hands and skip off to “find Lesbianca.” Uh huh. Aidan is so pretty. Maggie asks Babe to cut Lesbianca some slack and love her like the saint she is (Oh sister she’s so already there) but then she whines about it so much that Babe begins to have an anxiety attack.  You can tell she’s thinking, “Yikes! If this head case is all for letting Lesbianca roam free with my baby then there has to be something wrong.” Good work Maggie! Yet another rack scared away from your not girlfriend.  Erica (in a scene clearly shot 2 weeks ago) chews a massive amount of scenery at the funeral home. There were some really nice flashbacks though. Even some from the 80s.  At the very end of the episode Greenlee shows up At Erica’s, takes in the freak show Lesbianca is putting on and flips her hair. There was more stuff with Reggie, Bobby, Anita etc. but it was too boring for words. I do think I’ve figured out the lip-gloss factor. Only one woman at a time per scene is allowed to have on copious amounts of it. I still don’t know how they decide whose turn it is.     Bloody hell still no Lena.

        Tad and Krystal with a K are still in the hospital arguing over the possibility that there might have been some shenanigans over the baby that went buh bye. Tad: “I have 40 brain cells and the rest of you have, collectively, 9 and so I had a thought. Paul is a bad man and doesn’t know his thumb from an orange Popsicle, how could he be sure the baby than went missing is really Lesbiancas’ baby?” Krystal: “You shut up! I hate you. It was all fun and games when it was somebody else’s grandbaby but you are the devil to ever suggest it was mine! Never speak to me again.” Repeat variations on these lines every time they cut back to them.  Adam is having a meltdown over his missing grandchild. Lots of arm waving, spitting and hair shaking. Wow, but does he have a nice head of hair for an old coot. It’s like Michael Landon hair. I wonder what shade of toner he uses? I want that shade.  Mouth breather and Adam have a slap fight before Adam can call the cops.  Anita and bodacious ta-tas have a sisterly bonding crap fest over the fact that Anita let Lesbianca stagger off with a baby. I mean, I think that’s what they were discussing. I was having trouble concentrating because Anita had on, like, ¾ of a tube of lip-gloss. And her lips were all big and shiny and I was hoping Greenlee would come along and there would be making out. Anyway, Adam’s still pitching one in the hall and after several more hair shakes at Anita, she up and quits. She felt so bad, blah blah blah.   Babe (back up to full trailer trash make-up) doesn’t care that Lesbianca has her baby, it’s helping her cope or something. And she’s got JR on a very short leash so for the time being  he’s ok with no cops. In fact, he and Adam have it out (man, that head of geriatric hair is getting a major workout today) but as soon as JR wanders off Adam snatches up a phone and calls the cops.  Adam: “Wacky pervert killing, anorexic with a drunken mother lesbian stole my next evil cloning project! Er, granddaughter. I meant to say granddaughter. Just forget you heard the cloning thing officer.” Dear god in heaven Lesbianca if off her nut. She’s holed up at Erica’s ordering big piles of crap for the baby. And when did she have time to brush her hair and put on clean clothes? The continuity (or lack thereof) on this show makes me sad. At Jack’s Greenlee and Reggie are yelling about and whining about, respectively, his new “friend” when Kendall shows up looking for Lesbianca. Yay! Now there will be making out? Sadly no, but Kendall did paw at Greenlee a bit when she tried  to call Jack. (Jack is MIA by the way. I thought he was off looking for Erica but it turns out he is with someone named Lily. I’m guessing Lily is yet another offspring. Possibly one in rehab.) Hey doesn’t Reggie’s hair look cute? (Now if he would only shave the molester stash.)  Off Kendall goes to the boat house. Cause, you know, that’s where Greenlee would go it she was a baby snatching loonytoons and that is where she does go to talk to her dead, saintly boyfriend.   No Lesbianca at the boathouse, only the mouth breather. God he is the lamest tool in the shed.  Kendall: “I want to find Lesbianca so I can take her away to raise our baby. That’s right I am that baby daddy damnit!” Mouth breather: “don’t go. I need a line of at least 6 lip-glossed gals to watch me knit my brow and breath with my mouth open. And occasionally to watch me do push ups.  Lets get Lesbianca back so she can be the 6th! You’ll always be number one Kendall. ‘Cept when Greenlee is number one. Then you will be number two.” Kendall: “oh Ryan, because the writers are making me say this I love you! But it is physically painful. Luckily I am an amazing actress and can do it without vomiting.”      No Lena sightings.  The end. I had a lot of tequila while I was watching this so I probably left some stuff out. Sorry, you know,  tequila.

       Today is April fools day. Or, as I like to call it, the day of the "rank, arrogant amateurs". Pah, every fool thinks he or she can pull a worthy prank today! Wankers, this is pure evil you're dealing with and we are not impressed. (That's right, the royal we.) My advice to you is to watch your back and no matter what anyone says to you, mock. The bigger the mocking  the better. Example: A coworker tells you your car is being towed. Your response should be, "Yeah, I saw that going on when I was in the back seat of  your car  having sex with  your mother . I wasn't terribly concerned you know, because the sex with your mom and all." Or "You need to get those spreadsheets down to accounting before the afternoon meeting."  Your response should be, "Accounting just called. That meeting was cancelled because they're having a funds drive to raise the money for your frontal lobotomy and sex change combo operation. Aren't they a bunch of swell squares?" If anything happens to be true you can always apologize later and explain that you thought it was an April 1st prank. Then do that thing Pinky Tuscadero used to do on happy days.  Now for your amusement I have some prank stories. If you find them offensive know that I chose some mild ones and, Um, be glad. You puny humans couldn't comprehend the truly evil ones. And if you find them evil? Well, "it's obvious day at camp stupid." 1.) In high school my very favorite coconspirator (god he was truly, brilliantly evil) and I were suspected of some crime and were assigned to pep squad trash duty. (They had to start punishing us for suspicions because they could never pin anything on us and pep squad trash duty means we had to pick up trash behind the bleachers after football games. And I think that particular crime was that "somebody" dumped all the PE balls into the creek behind the sports fields. Dodge, volley, tennis, foot, etc. ALL of them.) So while on trash duty we came across a dead pigeon and realized immediately what had to be done. We stuffed it into a McDonalds' sack and hid it behind some never checked out books in the library. (I should explain that the head librarian was not in any way like Rupert Giles and was in every way like a nazi crossed with the grandmother from flowers in the attic. And also she was our arch nemesis.)  Then we sat back and waited. After about two weeks even the teachers were avoiding the place. It was pure luck that arch nemesis was the one who found our treat. Then she took a much-needed 3-day rest. 2.) Arch nemesis story number 2. Natural gas had just come to my hometown and the gas company decided they needed to give a lecture to the high school students in an assembly because, you know, 16 year olds give a rats ass about natural gas. Included in the lecture was a small pamphlet with a scratch and sniff spot which was even less interesting than the assembly. (Unless you were evil) Coconspirator procured a case of the pamphlets and over the next few weeks we would drop a few each day down into the heater boxes in the library. Once we had every pamphlet from that case stuffed into the heaters we sat back and waited.  For winter . You don't have to actually scratch the spot to get a sniff, all you have to do is heat it up a bit. We all know natural gas has no smell, that's why they add the yucky scent. So, imagine 3000 spots of the stuff being heated up all at once. Mayhem ensued and arch nemesis took yet another much-needed 3-day rest.  I was also going to tell you about the prank I pulled on the nerds when I belonged to the live action role playing society and the one I pulled on my sister while she was on her honeymoon but I'm sure you've all lost interest at this point and it's already too long.  Signed, your evil fool Valerie

       Well, ladies, I am back.  I just wanted to preface tomorrow's Twain's gathering by telling a little story about the never ending adventures of cheese in a tube.     It all started about half way through my trip when I wandered into a local English grocery store to search for this famous cheese in a tube.  The first thing I realized (stupid of me for not having this thought before this point) was that I didn't know whether the cheese was in a tube in the refrigerator section or in the dip/sauces section where our normal cheese whiz resides.  So, I wandered around aimlessly up and down the ever so unorganized and illogical isles hoping for the sight of something resembling cheese in a toothpaste tube.  Finally, I came across what seemed like such in the refrigerator section.  Of course the tube said "keep me refrigerated."  My thoughts then turned to "what am I going to do with this stuff for the next five days?  I have no refrigerator."  Could I hang them out my window...that would work for the evening hours, but of course the days I was in England were the hottest days the country had seen yet.  I decided I would wait until the last day of my trip and hope I could find a place to buy it then.   It is now three days before leaving.  I am staying at a person's house, so I now have a fridge.  I find cheese in a tube yet again in a small hole in the wall grocery store in the northern hills of England.  I buy their last two remaining tubes.  I figure this is better than nothing, but was disappointed because I really wanted a few more.  Anyway, I bring the 2 cheese in a tubes back to the house and safely secure them in the refrigerator.  The day before our plane takes off, we are all packing our stuff to relocate to a hotel near the airport as we are currently in the northern hills of England.  Upon the hustle and bustle of the relocation, the cheese in a tube is neglected and the family jets off to the train station without it.  It is left all alone in the fridge probably to rot until the 84 year old woman who owns the house realizes she needs a fall cleaning.  I become depressed.  I was so close to success, yet now, so far away.  I become obsessed to find this cheese in a tube.  My family laughs over little awwws of sympathy.     There is a spark of hope...my family and I had to return to Windsor to pick up our suitcases.  We decide to dine at a restaurant in a shopping area (the same area I first found the cheese in a tube).  It is 5:30 pm.  All the shops and stores are closing as humans don't work after 5:00.  We sit down at the restaurant.  I order a glass of wine.  I tell my mother what to order me for dinner.  I run out of the restaurant in search of the grocery store and hope it is still open.  I find it finally...and it is open.  I buy the cheese in a tube and make it back to the table before the meal arrived.  The cheese in a tube is mine, yet again.     Cheese in a tube has become the topic of conversation of my entire family...yes, ladies... aunts, uncles, cousins, parents, etc.  All of them now want to know WHAT IN THE HELL IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS CHEESE IN A TUBE.  I am embarrassed and try to talk about the food, the wine, the weather even.  They would not let me out of explaining why obtaining cheese in a tube has become the mission of the entire latter half of my trip. Whatever.     The moral of the story is...I have cheese in a tube.  I am most definitely sure at this point that it is probably the WRONG kind of cheese in a tube.  However, if it is.....I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.  :)

I mean really,  ever ?  urlLink http://www.cifnet.com/~geenius/buffyquiz.html   I took it 3 different times and ended up being Drusilla every time. She's insane and clairvoyant. I'm most definitely neither of those things. And yes, I choose different answers all 3 times. Because choosing the same answers but expecting different results is pretty much the definition of insane. Which I am so clearly not.   Oh, this is cool.  urlLink http://thesurrealist.co.uk/slogan.cgi?word=Valerie   But only if you use your name. My favorites: More Valerie please. Get the Valerie habit. And Wouldn't you rather be Valerie. In the spirit of lard making people happy,  urlLink http://www.qmimo.com/qmi_home_page_007.htm   This was a link within a page I sent out a while back. Click on food grade. Very, very wrong (or exciting, you know, depending on your particular issues.)  I watched the 31st annual daytime emmys recently because A) I'm easily entertained but, as I believe we established earlier, in no way insane and B) none of my very best friends in the whole wide world ever contacted me about the season 6 Buffy fest.  (thanks a lot.)   What else was I going to watch? Anyway, It should have been called the 31st annual daytime crap fest. All my children was only up for 3 awards (none of which they won because they suck) and a video clip of the evil Michael Cambias in his meat hook swinging, zombie phase could in no way make up for Al Roker singing the theme from Sesame St.   And finally, THE BLOG.  urlLink http://valerieledbetter.blogspot.com/   I'm still loading it up with past stuff but soon it will be new stuff. Then, instead of an email the size of a textbook (much like this one, you're thinking, as you roll your eyes), you'll receive a quaint, tiny really, email the size of a hastily scratched 6th grade note. "I like you. Do you like me? Check A for yes and B for no." Exactly like that. This site has the option to post pictures but I haven't  only because the instructions to do so are vague and endlessly looping. I know blogs are supposed to be about the text but given the opportunity to post obnoxious pictures as well, It's just too tempting to pass up. Perhaps one of you fine geeks (and by fine I  do not  mean very best friends in the whole wide world because we saw how poorly that all turned out) could provide some guidance on that sometime. I've had to split these emails into 2 groups because the server here at work has some very special rules and filters. I'm just letting you know so you won't forward it because you thought I was having a seizure and left someone out. And also to protect you from a sound slapping. No one wants to get this twice. Piffle, Valerie  Aidan: "Come on, we made love. We held each other. We even told each other stories before--you know, while we were falling asleep."  Kendall: "But I wasn't listening. You know me--I'm very self-involved. If it's not about me, it goes in one ear and out the other."  Greenlee: "You think you're packaging Fusion lipstick in containers you found in a chemical storeroom? Over my dead body!" Kendall: "Okay, let's all take a vote - all in favor of doing it over Greenlees’ dead body, raise your hand!" -AMC

       Greetings girls and boys, Todays' lesson is better living through chemistry. (And by chemistry I mean the Internet. Because I don't know anything about chemistry. It seems I don't have any and can't free base it. Scientists know about chemistry but I don't know any. Well, except my dad. But he's a rocket scientist and I don't think he knows any chemis....oh, wait, never mind. The Internet, on the other hand, is my friend.)   urlLink http://blacktable.com/fara1040428.htm  Excellent site that helps me obtain my goal of becoming an anal retentive drunky drunk  while, hopefully, keeping my liver from falling out.  urlLink http://www.amiannoying.com/(vbp33bnanitzlfqfb5fsij45)/Default.aspx  This is an outstanding waste of (company) time! Bonus, take the annoying test. (I did and, surprisingly, I'm extremely annoying.)  urlLink http://www.friendster.com/login.jsp?next=%2Fhome.jsp  Please join this now. Being the epitome of annoying, I need all the friends I can get.     urlLink http://www.marshmallowfluff.com/htm/welcome.shtml  The most demanding sanitary conditions? Oh god.  Once I gave my nephew a super sized  jar of marshmallow fluff as a Christmas gift. I had to explain to him how it was whipped sugar (being 3 and all, he couldn't read but he instantly grasp the concept of whipped sugar.  Whipped. Sugar.)  and for the rest of the day he was unwilling to release the jar. I was being supervised just a little too closely to actually open the jar for him but his parents had to pry it from his fingers at the expense of a foot stomping, head banging, arm waving hissy fit so it all turned out well in the end. Check out the enclosed photo. It's Buffy and Heather Duke, holding hands! Or, you could say it's Kendall and Brenda holding hands, whatever. It's all good.  And one more small thing. As you all are well aware, Buffy season six is being released a week from today onto DVD. Now, I'm sure a whole pack of you have pre ordered and will have the vampirey goodness in your hot little hands before the 25th. To that lot I want to say: You are my very best friends in the  whole wide world . Please call me ASAP so that we can plan our viewing fest and to let me know exactly how much liquor I need to bring.      Greenlee: "I'm not here to bail you out, Simone - I'm here to fire you!"  Kendall: " Hello , partner - you can't just fire Simone!"  Greenlee: " Hello , moron - this is her third arrest in a month!" -All My Children

       My recap of Thursdays’ episode. Too bad none of this really happened. It’s better this way, trust me.  Mouth breather and Greenlee are at a castle. They aren’t wearing enough clothes for it to be someplace where castles are cool (well, Greenlee always has on too many clothes for my tastes and Ryan not enough). I like my castles with snow and kilts. Mouthbreather:  This here castle is real fine. Like in that movie about Harry. You know, I could’ve been in that movie, I’ve got a bigger brow than that lame ass kid they picked. And the eyebrow to match.  Greenlee: Uh huh. Listen, do you think Kendall is on her way to stalk me at this very moment? I planned all this because I just love a good hair pulling fest in an exotic location! Mouthbreather: (whines) Greenlee! Forget her! It’s all about me. Hey, lets make out so people we don’t know and will never see again will think our fake getting married is for real! Greenlee: Jesus wept they are really not paying me enough to make out with you, you brain damaged monkey. FINE, I’ll just pretend you’re Kendall. When’s she getting here anyway?  Kendall and Simone (who’s sporting something extra fruity by the way) are in the PV private jet.   Simone: Do not let this plane take off so you can stalk Greenlee! I’m right here and clearly I’m more than willing to keep you entertained. Kendall: Gah! I must have Greenlee. Those arms, that lip gloss, she makes me crazy. We are taking off. You can come along or get off the plane. Whatever. Simone: Yeah! The plane should take off now. We can get drunk and make out in the air. Kendall: Why would Greenlee leave town without first giving me the chance at a colossal slap fight? Is it still sweeps? Do you think there’s a catfight planned for when we get there? Simone: Stop the plane! What if Greenlee slept with Mouthbreather? Ew! Kendall: Then she’s been very naughty and she will be receiving a spanking the moment we arrive! Now  get me a drink!  Simone: Yes ma’am!  At Jacks’ groovy pad for wayward lesbian moms, little boys with hair extensions who need acting lessons and all manor of wacky daytime high jinks: Tad: Erica is a nut ball. She’s in Las Vegas acting like she’s 12, it’s 1980 and Dallas’s Larry Hagman is the epitome of cool. And very possibly she’s freebasing.  Bianca: I hate my mom! My girlfister tried to tell me Erica was an 170 year old minor demon with a contract that predates the birth of christ stating she can come up with any freak show fairy tale story line she feels like and we all have to go along with it! But would I listen? Hell no! I was too busy with the rack checks!  Jack: Now, now precious, we have no idea what’s going through your mothers’ head at this time.  Bianca: Going through her head?!  Are you kidding me?  Have you even met the woman? Her head is merely something to attach her wig to! And possibly, she’s freebasing. Tad: Amen to that sister!  In Las Vegas: It’s not really worth discussing except to say that when Bobby tries to take away Ericas’ bloody Mary flames shoot out of her eyes and that, ladies and gentlemen, is why Bobby has only little patches of hair all over his face.    At the Hospital: Huey Lewis (aka Edmund) pitches a colossal hissy fit and chucks a bedpan at a male nurse. I really have no idea why he was pitching one I just know I was sad because he was not singing “I want a new drug” at top volume. Um, Anita witnessed all this. Isn’t it about time for her to “comfort” Bianca again?

       Recently I tried the speed dating thing again. Only this time I was smart, I took a posse. (Or, it could have been that I was a member of someone elses' posse. No, that didn't look right to me either. We'll stick with my posse.) Why is that smart? Because with the unknown element you're never guaranteed refreshing entertainment. But with the known element amusement is assured. So, they kept breaking us down into interest related groups. There was the favorite food group (I went with Mexican and chose well as that was basically a discussion of tequila). There was the favorite activities group (I went with golf and scared all the sporty spices with my tales of gang fights and peeing in the bushes at the crack course).  And there was a "likes to get up early" vs "likes to stay up late" group breakdown which was lame. What about the "functions slightly above comatose between the hours of 2 and 9 pm" group? After group happy time they let us (or made us, depending) talk to individuals. One person came armed with a list of questions like some sensitive version of the dating game with Jim Lange. I should have done that instead of just opening my mouth and having the most brain damaged stuff fall out. ("Wow, you have really big hair. It takes a lot of nerve to sport hair that big. I like it." Yeah,  I'm sure  she's gonna call.) But while the sensitive dating game contestants' questions were deep and thought provoking (No, I don't remember anything specific  because,  hello ? Her questions, not  mine .) I think I would have gone with perky mayhem. Or surly and rhetorical. "What do you think is going through the minds of people who stop at signs that say keep moving?"  "Remember when Faith and Buffy switched bodies? What did you think about that?" And back to my favorite subject, "Did you notice  my  tube socks match  my  shirt perfectly? It's not easy finding-insert tacky color not found in nature here-colored socks you know!"    On second thought, dear god I should never, ever be allowed a pencil and time to prepare. (powers for evil, not good) The whole sorted affair, while amusing, was somewhat vague. I had to base my final choices on things like biggest hair, best rack, who drank the most beer, that sort of thing. And I forced my friends to write my number down on their sheets wasting a whole line for my evil purposes. In conclusion speed dating is just like that old rockabilly song that goes, "I got 99 chicks but they won't do what I want em to do!"  Piffle kiddies, Valerie          Faith (as Buffy): You're a vampire.  Spike:  Was. And as soon as I get this chip out of my head, I'll be a vampire again. But until then, I'm just as helpless as a kitten up a tree. So why don't you sod off?  Faith (as Buffy): Okay.  Spike:  Oh, fine! Throw it in my face! Spike's not a threat anymore, I'll turn my back! He can't hurt me.  Faith (as Buffy): Spike?  Spike. William the Bloody with a chip in his head. I kind of love this town.  Spike:  You know why I really hate you, Summers? Faith (as Buffy): (cheerfully) 'Cause I'm a stuck-up tight-ass with no sense of fun?  Spike:  Well . . . Yeah, that covers a lot of it.  Faith (as Buffy):  'Cause I could do anything I want, and instead I choose to pout and whine and feel the burden of Slayerness? I mean, I could be rich. I could be famous. I could have anything. Anyone. Even you, Spike. I could ride you at a gallop until your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up. I've got muscles you've never even dreamed of. I could squeeze you until you pop like warm champagne and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more. And you know why I don't?  Because it's wrong.

       I read some delightful books and saw some delightful television this past week (“delightful” and “television” in the same sentence? Humph!). Seeing how I’m a lazy git and all, I’ve simply assembled some quotes from my viewing pleasures for your devoted worship and mirth. And I’ve called it a list so there’s another quota well met. First up, some quotes from Mil Millingtons’ latest. I learned some new bad words and the novel is set in Edinburgh. Hooray! (Oh! Speaking of Edinburgh-‘christ she’s going to force us to strike her about the head, isn’t she?’-It’s official, I’m going back! Double hooray! At the end of the year and if any of you want to come along that’d be swell. I know you won’t want to come you see, so I can make that offer and come off looking all polite and stuff. I don’t care if you don’t come, I’ll be having a blast and you’ll be jealous, you know you will, tossers. New years eve in Scotland, can you imagine? And winter would be the perfect time for all those brewery and gasoline distillery, aka whisky, tours I missed out on last time. Now if I can just convince my friend(s) there that they want to put me up. I can’t very well sleep in the bus station and I’m a bit old for the youth hostel. -and by a bit I mean a great deal-.Wow, that was a rambling mess wasn’t it? Back to Mil.) He manages to work in an Alyson Hannigan reference, which I didn’t include here, but still, that he did so is brilliant. Crazy Brit, he’s obsessed.  1) “London agents-bastards! ‘Oh, so you live up here? How wonderful. Wish I could, it’d be far better for my nerves.’ Twats. They need their shins beaten with a spade.” 2) “If you want to be a statue in Edinburgh, you have to hold  something . I reckon it’s a bylaw.” 3) “A clever tongue is a wonderful gift, so it is…but it always holds the danger of making me come over there and thump you, you wee English bastard.” 4) “It’s a matter of some pride, locally, that Princes Street has the highest mortality rate of any road in Britain.” 5) And several obscenities: A right old cockney geezer. Arse, piss drips and chips! A right slag. Bamstick.  One of the characters in this book is called the Vielfrass and he has all the best lines. To me the name conjures up some sort of prancing, vampire, beerish image. I’m considering taking it as my new nickname, soon to be scrawled in my third grade handwriting on golf balls everywhere. 6) “I am the Vielfrass. Yes, I see this information renders you speechless.” 7) Vielfrass: “I should perhaps state at the outset of our conference that I do not kidnap young ladies plying their ancient trade and cut them into easily portable pieces. How devastating it is to have to mention this.” Oozola: “Pooh! You sure like talking about it!” Vielfrass: “Silence, faithful floozy, or I’ll stab you cross-eyed.” 8) Vielfrass: “My child, if I have to repeat one more thing that I have hitherto made perfectly clear, I shall assuredly beat you.” 9) Yngyn: “Must you inquire into the affairs of every menial in the palace royal? What is it: an ingrained tendency to pry or simple nostalgia?”  I watched an Angel story arch because I saw that Drusilla was going to be in it (and yes, I’m watching them out of order. What can I say, It’s what I do.) and so she was along with Darla. I never liked Darla when she was on Buffy but I’ve got to say she’s much better on Angel. Maybe it’s the skanky haircut but probably it’s just that next to Drusilla, everybody gets a little insane aura working. 10) Dru: “I saw you coming my lovely. The moon showed me. It told me to come into the 20th century.” Angel: “It’s the 21st century Dru.” Dru: “Hmmm, I’m still lagging. (Slams him across the room with a shovel.)” 11) (Dru and Darla are standing in the middle of the street having just had a cat fight and now hugging each other and crying)  Guy: “You two wanna move it out of the street? Why don’t you and your girlfriend take the makeout session on home. The rest of us have lives.” Darla: “Not for long.” (she eats him) Dru: “You’re all new again.” Darla: “Let’s go shopping, hmm?” (They skip off down the street holding hands.) 12) Dru: “Oh, I’m ringing-do you hear it? I’m ringing-all-over! (Darla watches her for a moment then reaches down the front of Drus’ dress and pulls out a cell phone.) Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.” 13) Darla: “Why is everybody trying to make this all about Angel?! I mean, for gods sake, can’t a woman wreck a little havoc without there being a man involved?” 14) Darla: “You know, in a perfect world, Angel would be here right now, helping me burn this city to the ground. But where is he? Probably flogging himself in a church somewhere.” Dru: “Ooh flogging! Ew, churches.” And some fine remarks from Cordelia from the same episodes. 15) Cordy: “Ugh! It’s always the same. A smelly, old abandoned building. Are there no demon hideouts in Beverly Hills?” 16) Cordy: “Earth to retards: If you have an obsession you pretty much squeeze that into your schedule, no matter what!” 17) Cordy: (extra drunk)”Vampires, sloth demons-you know what’s really, really evil?  Tequila !”

       In honor of the upcoming fests, one this weekend and one in 2 months, a little comparison. Which is better? Oh no, I’m not getting involved in  that  argument. Check out the facts then decide for yourself.  1) Pride: Entirely too many people (women in particular) running around topless who have no business doing so.  Dragon Con: Entirely too many people running around scantily clad or crammed into bondage gear who have no business doing so.  2) Pride: Lots and lots of pets forced to wear fruity outfits and collars. Dragon Con: Lots and lots of make believe fruity pets perched on shoulders (dragons mostly).  3) Pride: Children dragged along and forced to witness the freak show.  Dragon Con: Children dragged along and forced to participate in the freak show.   4) Pride: Pretty boys wearing nothing but cut off jean shorts flinging frisbees at each other in the park. Dragon Con: Goth boys wearing all black flinging cigarettes at each other in the parking lot.  5) Pride: Drunken buffoons sporting hats made of rainbow colored balloons. Dragon Con: Pompous buffoons sporting wizard hats depicting their house colors.  6) Pride: Big, scary parade with lots of people cross-dressed, most of them skipping. Dragon Con: Big, scary parade with lots of people cross-dressed, some of them marching.  7) Pride: Swag! Condoms, lube, koozies. Dragon Con: Swag! Glossy colored maps of middle earth, star fleet battles trading cards, koozies.  8) Pride: Too many booths trying to sell you better quality internet service. Dragon Con: Too many panel discussions about the better qualities of the internet.  9) Pride: Dreadful bands hired to play on the sole concession that they’re gay. Dragon Con: Dreadful bands hired to play on the sole concession that one of their members used to be in a popular sci-fi TV show.  10) Pride: Beautiful women at fringe parties who wouldn’t speak to you even if your hair were on fire. Dragon Con: People dressed as storm troopers, Anime characters and vampires who will speak to you with absolutely no provocation whatsoever. Often at great length and occasionally in the Klingon language.

       Inspired by the incredibly offensive yet entertaining movie reviews I collect, I’ve decided to have a go at it. A list of the worst 10 movies I’ve seen and could remember at this very moment. I’d love to “review” dirty dancing, top gun or ghost but there is no way I’m sitting through them. Most of the movies I’ve listed probably made tons of money so clearly my opinions are addled.   10.) Any Police academy movie (or actually any movie at all) with Steve Guttenberg. According to the Simpson’s he only became famous because of the masons which makes way more sense than my “sold his soul to the devil” theory. I imagine “cocoon” and “3 men and a baby” are playing 24 hours a day, back to back in the movie theatre in hell. And on the weekends they show  “short circuit”, “it takes two” and, of course, the police academy movies because, well, it’s hell.  9.) Far and away. I want to know who was hopped up on crack and handing out blowjobs so that this pile of horror could get greenlighted. I knew it was a bad idea but still, somehow got forced to sit through it. Nicole Kidman has since redeemed herself and has been moved off the list but Tom Cruise? Yeah,  no . I thought their accents were the worst thing about this, until the sex scenes came along. Nicole may be a good actress but even she couldn’t convince me she was enjoying being pawed by monkey boy.  8.) Jerry Maguire.  Please refer to my football rant for this review.(Posted 01-24-04)  7.) Space Balls. Mel Brooks, ”Say, I think I can mock this Star wars thing the kids are all about these days! I’ll get the kiddie audience sucked in, to go along with my geriatric following. Now, whom can I hire? Who’s hip and happening? I know! Some of those punks from the SCTV, fruity Canadians, the kids love them. And Joan Rivers! The kids go wild for her potty mouth. And by potty mouth I mean she opens her mouth and screeches like a chicken spotting a bug. I’m so smart, I’ll make a bazillion dollars. Never mind that the Star wars ship sailed 7 years ago and children have the attention span of....children, they’ll love me!”  6.) Full House. Yeah, I know it’s a TV show, not a movie, shut up. It’s bad. Usually little children are cute. Not this bunch. The Olsen twins were trolls (even my mother referred to the show as “the monkey baby show”) and the other 2 kids were well on their way to anorexic prostitution and drug habits. Bog Saget is the TV version of Steve Guttenberg and the other dude in the Hawaiian shirts was like a scary clown sans makeup. The only good thing about that show was John Stamos. But 1 mulleted stud cannot cancel out the horror of troll babies, crackhead preteens, evil buffoons or the slumming version of Steve Guttenberg.  5.) Coyote Ugly. This movie was a gyp. The women jump around as if they’re naked, slinging booze all over everybody, shaking their bottoms in peoples faces and reading their lines off of cue cards large enough that you can actually see the shadow of them at the edge of the screen. Problem is, they  aren’t  naked. Maybe the actual experience of attending the bar is better, I wouldn’t know. I’ve never been able to sucker anyone into taking me. Rent real porn, it’s got the naked.  4.) Lost and Delirious. I saw this at a film festival when it was called something else. I guess they figured if they changed the name they could trick all the people who saw it at film festivals into paying to see it again. And they needed to trick us because I could hardly keep from making that choking, gurgling sound all during the movie. When I wasn’t gagging I was resting my eyes. Pretentious piece of coming out fairy tale. Oh and hey, the main “beautiful, tortured youth” was also in Coyote Ugly. Go rent real lesbian porn.  3.) Laurel Canyon. I saw this at the Edinburgh film festival last summer. I almost couldn’t include it here because I only saw three fourths of it. Yes, I had to walk out before it was over. I guess the fact that it’s an independent film was what attracted Christian Bale, Kate Beckinsale and Frances McDormand to it. “Look at me, I’m making an art film!” I think the theme was “my mom’s still a wacky hippie and I’m her uptight, upright son. How ever will we get along? Let me get my yuppie girlfriend and move in with mom.” Mayhem ensues. Except mayhem does not ensue. Naptime ensues.  Here’s a funny after note. On the plane back from Scotland I’d just explained how this was the only movie I saw there that sucked to the seemly interested (and by interested I mean bored but I was practically hallucinating at that point from exhaustion) young man sitting next to me. And then they started playing it on our TVs!  He watched the whole damn thing! One scene where women make out does not a movie make.   2.) Good Will Hunting. I saw this with my sister (thank god as she was the one doing all the entertaining, the movie sure wasn’t) and we spent the entire movie making up new, replacement titles. I think I won with “good lord, puking!” Affleck wrote this and let his bestest butt buddy Damon star in it. It’s a movie about math. Yay! Robin Williams is also in it but since he abandoned all hope of ever appearing in a movie that didn’t suck back in the early 90s, I don’t have any comments about his performance. No, wait, one thing. I think he had retarded facial hair.  1.) American Pie. I had a free pass for this dreck and I still felt like I paid too much. Yes, I know some of you would pay good money to see Alyson Hannigan eat paste or read the labels on cans of cat food. She was doing neither here. I will admit when she was on the screen my nausea disappeared but sadly that was not nearly enough. The following people were in this movie because (I must assume) they had massive gambling debts, freebasing addictions and/or student loans they needed to pay off/for: Eugene Levy, Natasha Lyonne, Jennifer Coolidge, Molly Cheek, and Eden Riegel. The following people from this movie will be appearing in the surreal life in about 10 minutes: Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, and Seann William Scott.  Especially  Seann William Scott.

       In honor of the Cracker slash Camper Van Beethoven concert this weekend (which I very possibly might get to attend-whoohoo!), a list of my favorite quotes from them.  10) Well, maybe he went to get an Air Force parka       Maybe he went to get a Vespa scooter       Maybe he went to get a British flag       Maybe he went to go Mod Ska dancing       -Where the hell is Bill?  9) There's not a line that goes here that rhymes with anything (anything, anything)     -Take the skinheads bowling  8) Now here I am, I am the game warden of love      'til someone took away my gin and tonic      Don't mess me up I'm on a roll      Keep being wise, I'll be inspired      Don’t fuck me up with peace and love when I haven’t got it in me      - Don’t fuck me up (with peace and love)  7) Some people they gotta work       well I just hang around      dreaming up useless stuff     -Useless stuff  6) Well I fell, but you fell much farther, I was envious      Around here, everyone loves you, cuz you are insane     -My life is totally boring without you  5) I don't know what the world may need,       but a V8 engine is a good start for me.

       Hey, remember that song, “99 chicks”? (No, but continue.) How about that song, “88 lines about 44 women”? Yeah, that was a good song. Well, that’s the new plan, 99 lists. I  love  lists. Love making them I mean. If I have a list I can face the day with anal-retentive gladness in my heart. Plus I don’t have to keep all that crap in my brain. This plan should keep me busy and off the streets for a few minutes at least.  List #1: Observations about the dollar store I adore the dollar store. Maybe it’s the white trash in me but I love spending $12 and getting a bag of crap so heavy I can hardly carry it to my car.    Why is everything at the dollar store sticky?  Ew , thank goodness they also sell wet naps.  Don’t buy undershirts at the dollar store. Wherever they manufacture them a mens size 46-48 chest does not equal an American mens size 46-48 chest.   Other things you should not buy at the dollar store-bras, make-up (lip gloss, lip balm and nail polish are ok), hair dye, hair care products. Sometimes, quality matters.  The foodstuffs are exotic and foreign. And sometimes the package is only in a foreign language.  If you buy something and discover you really, really like it, go back immediately and buy all they have. If it’s so damn excellent then they will never carry it again.  Great candy! I don’t really like candy unless it’s weird. And boy, dollar store candy is weird. Ginger flavored mints. Gum that was the bomb when I was seven. Stuff so hot you’d think it was mislabeled as candy and should in fact be labeled as hot ass spicing.   Don’t ask the stock people where stuff is. It makes them anxious and it confuses you. I ask for eyeglass repair kits and get sent to NSYC coloring books. Ask the owners, they even remember what was on aisle 4, 3rd shelf down six months ago.  Sometimes, mostly around the holidays, they give you coupons. 6 pieces of crap for the price of 5, gak!  If you only go once a month, it’s like a whole new store the next time you go back.

       My neck hurts. I’m pretty sure it’s because I slept all squished up funny last night. I sleep weird when I’m  freezing  my ass off! Mc’s back and I guess she though it was too hot. Here’s a tip precious: If you’re wearing double layered sweat pants and have to cover yourself with a blanket just to watch TV, you’re  cold , not hot. The thermostat should be turned to the higher numbers, not the lower ones. And tip number two: Do not put me in complete charge of temperature control if what you really mean to do is put me in complete charge of temperature control until you are unsatisfied with the temperature. That is just cruel and it promotes a false sense of supervision.  Other than that though, I’m fine. I had a delightful weekend. Friday night I read a book and finally calmed down after my break in trauma. Saturday morning I had my best golf game to date. A 45 on the 9 hole crack course. 45 minutes of putting practice just might be the answer. Then I got to hear all about the exciting exploits of my, currently, favorite little monkey over lunch. In the evening I played drinking trivia where I learned many new and interesting facts. (Such as, in France a French kiss is called an English kiss. Ok, maybe what I meant to say was I learned many new and  drunken  facts.) I was supposed to watch the only episode of Buffy I’ve never seen but the power was out. Then I went to a Davy Jones concert. Poor Davy, more singing of the oldies please and less comedy stylings. Axel Rose totally stole his moves from Davy Jones. On Sunday I played golf again and didn’t do nearly as well as I did on Saturday but I didn’t care because it was so fun. Then, because it was raining (and, despite my firm statements of, “it’ll blow over any time now”, did not let up at all) I spent all afternoon and evening drinking beer and watching replay TV. I saw 3 Joan of Arcadias, an old Angel episode with Buffy and Faith (must’ve been sweeps), 3 rocked with Gina Gershon, a really bad Lebanese movie (and by really bad I mean Canadian), a worlds apart I’d never seen and the Whos Tommy.  Ann Margaret writhing around in baked beans still cracks me up. Ah Tommy, can you hear me indeed. One more thing, If any of you are offended that I use your real names when I post this crap, let me know and I will assign you a fake name. But don’t be all acting like you get to pick the fake name cause you don’t. (“hmmm, Maybe I should just let her use my real name, that seems less ominous.”)

       Stupid karma.  Last night my car got broken into. Well, not broken into since I don’t lock it but stuff got stolen. I’d come home rather late from a delightful evening of laying in the street and, because it was so late, decided to just park in the driveway. I figured I wasn’t going to be there that long, just to sleep, and I was tired. Plus, the last people that borrowed the truck parked it retarded when they returned it and I could barely get past it into the garage. I know they don’t read this but still, park better. Ok, so, the karma part. Just hours earlier I was scheming about how to steal the Angel billboard in Tucker. I figured the shows cancelled, the billboard is one of those single, giant sheets they just tie down  and  it would look fantasticleese on the roof of the house. It’s wicked cool too. Angel looks all dangerous and airbrushed. But come on, it was just big talk. I no longer have any minions (and this job would require several), at least none that would help in an 8th grade criminal activity. Also, I’m too old for that kind of shit. And if I know I’m too old, I’m too old. (Sometimes I still have lapses of judgment as to what constitutes “a good idea at the time”) I had no idea just  thinking  evil thoughts would get me punished. I mean, I have thoughts all the time about the deliciously perverted things I’d like to do to a select few of you. (You know who you are. And by that I mean you haven’t got a clue,  thank god , because if you did there’d be restraining orders and shunning and the rest of you would mock me for being such a bent up perv.) Yes, if the mere thinking of the evil gets me into trouble then I am  so  screwed without a kiss. So, they took my bolleramas. These are the best sunglasses on the planet. And the only pair of sunglasses I owned that cost more than a dollar. They were functional (kept the sun out of my eyes, even with the top down, so I wouldn’t have to wear a hat thus messing up my hair. Ha-Ha!) And they were retro cool. Ray Ban has been making them since the 50s and I liked to imagine that when I wore them I was super fine, hip 50s spy chick. Of course the reality was I looked like a tard but it’s good to have dreams. I’ve had those damn things for at least 15 years and they were $80.00 when I got them. On sale! They probably don’t even make them anymore, bastards. They also took my book of CDs. Who would give you crack money for CDs without the cases? This is what was in the book. Rod Stewart-Blondes have more fun The Backstreet boys Jet-get born The Osmonds-21 hits With the Beatles Buffy-Radio Sunnydale Hall and Oats-greatest hits The Beatles-Sgt. Pepper Collective soul-greatest hits Valerie’s big disc o’ cool cheese (homemade-duh) The Monkees greatest hits (my mix) Back to the 80s (homemade) The Breeders-Pod The Who-Who’s next Iggy Pop-Nude and Rude ELO-double disc greatest hits  Hmmm, maybe this is their karma. Crackhead moron ends up with CD collection of a clearly disturbed individual. I guess I’ll buy one a week until I replace them all. Or, maybe you might have some of these I could copy. I still have the set up for the big disc o’ cheese but the 80s CD? That was the 1st CD I ever made (and clearly the best if I’m still playing it). I do have the cover though so maybe I can work it out from that. Guess I won’t replace the sunglasses. It sucks but I imagine if I had $80.00 to spend all at once I’d buy something constructive like new climbing shoes, sports bras that breathe or tires. Things they didn’t take: Disco, rocket scientist flashlight ANY $1 sunglasses Baseball cap Garage door opener Key to the truck Key to Mc’s car Huge stack of directions to your houses (If I’ve ever been to your house and you live more than 2 blocks from me, there were directions.) Cheap ass CD player Gum and/or mints. I thought drug addicts liked sugar. Well, I have to throw them all away now. I have issues and couldn’t possibly eat them after they were fondled by who knows what.  I really, really hope it wasn’t the thinking of the bad thoughts that caused this. I hope it was because I did some brain-addled damage then promptly forgot all about it.

        Mc went out of town recently leaving the care of her cat to me. Poor kitty. “But cats are delicious!” you say. Don’t I know it! We’ve done all right I guess (and by all right I mean I haven’t eaten him and he gets food) but he’s got issues and they are many and vast. Here’s how our conversations go: Cat: (whining) You scare me. When’s the good one coming back? Me: What is wrong with you? You’ve got food, see? And water. Have a drink of water, it’ll make you feel better. Cat: (whining) I don’t like you. You won’t let me play in the basement or go in your room. Not that I’d want to go in there anyway, it smells like you and I don’t like you. When’s the good one coming back? Me: Shut up. You have no concept of time. All you know is now, then and forever. She’s coming back in forever. Now go outside and stare at the chickens next door.  Cat: (whining) Crazy, bovine bitch.  And on another day:  Cat: (whining) God, you again. You’re always here. Where’d the good one go? Me: Why am I hearing you? You don’t like me, remember? It’s a shame about the no thumbs thing,  really . That’s got to suck. Cat: (whining) If the good one ever comes back I’m going to tell her about how all you ever do is push around the noisy monster, sucking up all the lovely hair I’ve so graciously placed all over every square inch of this place. And it hurts my ears. Me: Hey rabies, I can’t hear the TV over you. Run along and stalk something. Or maybe you’d like to help me vacuum? Don’t make me get the vacuum out.  And yet another day.  Cat: (whining) Hey, I thought I heard the good one! Is she back? She isn’t. What did you do to her? I know it was you that made her go away. You are evil and off-putting.   Me: Christ on a raft rat boy I swear she’s coming back! Did I ever tell you I’m really glad she figured out a way to keep you from dragging your kills into the house? Yeah,  she  did that. The one you think is your god.  She  ruined all your little plans of taunting and maiming your prey on the hardwood floors. Come to think of it, she is kind of a god for putting that to a stop. Cat: (whining) I lounge on your computer when you aren’t here. I get my cooties  alllll  over it and you can’t stop me. Me: Oh  somebody  woke up cranky from his 18-hour nap.  Cat: (whining) Someday my kind will once again rule this world and then you’ll pay. Me: Dream on rat boy.  Vicky sent me the coolest haiku about cats but I can’t find it. I know I have it at home. I’ll add it later.    Ok, I couldn't find the haiku. Why would I delete it? It was really good. Anyway, have one more exchange I forgot about in its place. Cat: Hey satan, it's hotter than the sun in here. It's hotter than outside in here. The good one keeps it nice and cool. See how I'm covered in hair? I'm hot and I don't like you. Me: The one you're not a big scaredy pants about keeps it like a meat locker in here. I like it hot. I'm satan, it reminds me of home. Why don't you go outside and lie in the red clay for a while? Then come back inside and rub it all over everything. That's always fun and it will cool you right down. Cat: I'm not afraid of you. If I felt like it I could steal your breath while you sleep. Me: Sure you could, if you had  thumbs  to open my door with. Say, I know what will cool you off. Where's my water pistols?

       People, help me out here. I’ve found the perfect cheerleading outfits for my disturbed fantasy slash nerd festival costume.  urlLink http://www.cheeretc.com/stockcheeruniforms.htm  They’re cheap (trust me, they are. You should see what the other places wanted. And none are to be had locally. I’ve spent weeks stalking school coaches, dance clothing stores and former cheerleaders current dance clothing store clerks), they look good (albeit only maroon and not maroon and gold but more on that later), they come in all sizes, and they even have the mini skirted version I, sadly, require. But, and here’s where my plea comes in,  you have to order six sets to order at all!  There is no way I personally need six sets of cheerleading uniforms. Not to mention the cost involved.  (I mean, I guess I could be a cheerleader for the next six halloweens. Sunnydale high, Heathers high, 90210 high, etc. blah blah blah. But what if I lost weight in the next six years. Or, god forbid,  gained  weight? And I’d be really, really old by the time the last one got worn as if I’m not too old already for all this shit. And the cost! Pah! Never mind, no, I cannot purchase six sets.) I need five of you to help me out. I’m pretty sure two of you are already willing. That leaves three. Help me out,  Puleeeezzzzeeee.  I’d like to think you’re going, “Oh ha ha! That wacky Valerie, she’s disturbed in an obsessed yet amusing and mostly harmless way and so what the hell. I’ll play her little reindeer games. And I can probably use the uniform later for (insert your own fantasy here).”  Instead of going, “Oh ha ha! That wacky Valerie, she doesn’t have the sense god gave a goose. Why isn’t she in therapy or heavily medicated or something. I think I’m just going to sit back and watch her little drama crash and burn and then she’ll have to make her own outfit and she can’t even sew so that’ll be even better. Honey, do we have plenty of film in the camera?” There must be five of you out there that like me enough, right? I’ve been told on rare occasions that people like me. I know for a fact that geriatrics like me. Small children and pets do not like me, they simply fear me. Luckily none of you are small children or pets. And if you’re a guy and you’re reading this, don’t let the fact that you are male deter you. I suspect you have lovely legs, all long and perfect for a pleated skirt. I couldn’t figure out the cost of the chest patches cause, you know,  math . But I know I can make maroon and gold chest patches out of felt. I may suck with the needle but I’m golden with the scissors and glue. Then that would be the gold on the, mostly, maroon uniforms. Really, ask anyone that attended the 2nd Harry Potter movie with me. I made the most amazing maroon and gold scarf out of felt. It looked just like the ones the kids in the movie were wearing.     Ok, so I’ve calmed down some. Just think it over. It’ll be loads of fun,  really . You know you want to help.

       When the Buffy series ended there were tons of ideas for new projects being pitched and discussed. None of them have come to pass. And none of them were wacky enough for me anyway. So, this is my idea for a post Buffy project. Spike and Drusilla have a talk show! Sort of like Space ghost crossed with Regis and ex AMC star Kelly Ripa. But, you know, much more surly, belligerent and insane. Lots of tirades by Spike when Dru makes him crazy. And on special occasions Spike could present Dru with discombobulated body parts. “In honor of your 200th birthday Luv I’ve had Elton John turned. Now you can hear him play all the young girls love Alice to your dead hearts’ content.” “Oh Spike, he sparkles like all the fishies at the bottom of the gay, blue sea.” Oh! And they could have Andrew do special video reports. Then, when he would show up at the studio, Spike could threaten to strike him if he didn’t quit being such a poof and Dru could frighten him into wetting his pants. Any guest that sucked (say, Steve Guttenberg, Tom Cruise, Bijork, etc. blechity blech.) would be eaten. During musical performances Dru could roll around in the floor as if she were freebasing and Spike could clutch his head in his hands and/or chain smoke. Doesn’t that sound like the funniest thing  ever?!  (No Valerie, it does not. What it sounds like is you have too much free time, you’re way under supervised and you haven’t killed off enough brain cells with beer. Hurry up with that already.)

        Replacing the cast of AMC with characters from Buffy? It’s harder than it sounds. That’s because the characters on Buffy were rich, well developed, multi layered. Sometimes good, sometimes evil, mostly in between. But the characters on AMC are one-dimensional (unless you count bipolar as two-dimensional). I suppose it doesn’t really matter because the people that are going to see this won’t even get it (two of you maybe). Mostly I’m just entertaining myself. Could you do better? Probably if it weren’t for the job and the life and the normal hobbies that fill your time.   Kendall: Buffy-The obvious choice. Bianca: Willow-Perky and the girlfister angle still flies. Brooke: Joyce Summers-Brooke is the only character with an ounce of maternal instinct. Palmer: Giles-The only one with any sense. Greenlee: Glory-A hair flipping, fit pitching, ex god fashion whore. Yep, that’s Greenlee. Mary: Cordelia-Clearly superior at all times. Erica: Drusilla- INSANE . Tad: Xander-Smarty pants. Maggie: Dawn-At first I thought Lily should be Dawn because the kid that used to play Lily became Dawn but then I remembered that Dawn was a key and a key is a tool and Maggie is a huge tool.  Opal: Anya-Entertaining nut jobs, the both of them. Simone: Faith-Have you ever seen Simone pitch one? 5x5. Aidan: Spike-Oh, pretty. And Bonus, smirking accent. Adam: Principal Snyder-Equal parts teeth gnashing and superiority.   David: Wesley-Sneaky, brooding gits. Michael Cambias: Angel-“oh I’m good, oops now I’m evil. Look at me, back from the dead.” Reggie: Oz-Adorable  and  hip and happening. Babe: Harmony-Babe is still in cheerleader Harmony mode. Time will tell if Babe can become vampire Harmony. Ryan: Riley-Big lug head. At least Riley was cute. Maria: Tara-Yeah that’s the best I could do. But you know, nice racks. Jackson: The mayor-I went for the politeness factor. Well, that and the big cheesy grin. Boyd: Andrew-Prancing nancy boy. Jamie: Jonathan-So, so cute. And so, so vacant.   Stuart: Clem-HaHa! Myrtle: Halfrek-Myrtle’s always going on about being from “carny folk”. And a vengeance demon is sort of like a carnival extravaganza.   Liza: Amy-Amy spent most of her time on the show as a rat. Just like Liza. Lena: Kennedy-yum. JR: Warren-Bad hair, pissy attitude, putz. Edmond: Robot Ted-Remember when robot Ted threatened to slap Buffy in the mouth? I keep hoping Edmund will threaten someone, possibly Maddie, that way. Mia: Buffy Bot-Again I say, HaHa!

       On my planet (which is the sun in case you were wondering and isn’t really a planet at all but as we learned from they might be giants  is  a mass of incandescent gas, or perhaps you learned it in second grade science class and I meant the royal we but whatever. Me calling a mass of incandescent gas my home planet is appropriate on a level in which you’ve come to expect.) I take my heroes, gods and potential slayers very seriously.  It may seem there are quite a lot but it still doesn’t dismiss the fact that, while I’m easily entertained, I’m not easily impressed.    urlLink http://www.mil-millington.com/    urlLink http://www.hollisgillespie.com/index.htm    urlLink http://www.disgruntledhousewife.com/    urlLink http://www.dubberley.com/    urlLink http://margaretcho.net/blog/    urlLink http://vrya.net/bdb/index.php    urlLink http://www.fast-rewind.com/    urlLink http://kuenai.net/    urlLink http://bloglife.net/users/rsingh/    urlLink http://www.vaptek.com/

       Really, my time with Paris the anorexic kitty wasn’t that exciting. Todd thinks she’s a drama queen. I had heard they were buds but I caught Todd giving her dirty looks when she would plop down in places he couldn’t go. Paris the anorexic kitty is either A) very, very clever thinking that if she’s stubbornly consistent then some day, somehow, some human will forget they fed her and feed her again. Or B) she’s like that guy in that Memento movie and her short-term memory is only three minutes long.  Paris: Hey, what’s that?! That’s candy! I want candy. Gimmie, I’m starving! Me: It’s nail polish you little monkey! And I just fed you. Paris: Candy! Give it! Say, what’s  that?  I could eat that. Me: It’s a comic book. And while technically it is edible its collectible value far outweighs its nutritional value. Paris: Mr. Tickles! Hey, Mr. Tickles wants to come out of that glass box and play with me! Me: Sorry Paris, I specifically ask Veronica this- if Mr. Tickles was to expire from three hams then would I be allowed to turn him over to you for playtime. And she said…well, I’m not allowed to use  those  kinds of words in front of you so lets just go with no. Paris: (throws herself to the floor in a disgusted, angst-ridden heap.) Todd: God, what a drama queen. High five?

       I think I took too many vitamins this morning. Yeah, I’m sure I did. My mind was elsewhere, as it often is, and the vitamins have been relocated. So, as I was packing my Buffy lunchbox I took a set. Then I wandered off to put on my shoes and brush my hair. (HaHa! That’s a joke, I don’t have enough hair to brush and haven’t actually brushed it since I got it cut. I combed it once though so settle down.) I forgot I’d taken the first set and took a second set when I went back into the kitchen. During the morning meeting I was buzzing like Bevis hopped up on sugar.    I just found out about something called Brazilian steak. It’s a tender steak, not marinated or otherwise molested in any travestied way, rolled in chunky salt then grilled. Oh my god, my evil, carnivore, salt whore heart is stopping at the mere thought. Also, I drooled a little.  Z93 has changed their format. They used to be pretty good (and the radio station of the gods compared to 99X these days) except they played too much Led Zeppelin (yeah, yeah, is there even such a thing as too much Led Zeppelin-stop helping me stoner hippies). But now they are outstanding. In one 40 minute block I heard Elvis Costello, really, really old Elvis too, Icicle works, Tom Petty, Nirvana, Oasis and the Stray Cats.  They are still too excited about their format change so they spend 20 minutes telling us how great they are, don’t be afraid of the change etc. And I haven’t heard Mara either. After the commercial break of them flogging themselves with goodness, they played old Indigo girls. When I  switched back  to them they had moved on to Live. Ok, so lay off the “we are so great” plugs, the Indigo girls and Live and bring back Mara. Then we can continue with the cruising of the outstanding.  Remember that Episode of Buffy where Dracula shows up? It turns out the guy that played Dracula played Kendall’s husband on AMC when Sarah Michelle Gellar was playing Kendall. That would explain a lot about Erika, wouldn’t it? Her daughter is a vampire slayer and her son in law is a vampire. HaHa!  Todays’ fantasy marriage, Hollywood edition: Male-Giovanni Rebisi. (Giovanni was on my two dads where he sported an adolescent mullet. That show was bad because Paul Reiser was in it and it was stupid. That show was good because Greg Evigan and Giovanni were in it and it was stupid.)  Female-Andrea Parker. (Andrea kicked ass as this evil, chain-smoking centre operative in the pretender. She was hot. And evil. Now she has a new gig in some crap sitcom where she’s blond. She’s still evil but it's more in the comedy vein.)   I love the way drivers of Miata convertibles always wave at me. And if I see them first, I wave first and they always wave back. It’s like belonging to a really goofy club. I’ll bet Honda, SUV or Mercedes drivers don’t act like that.  Hey, you know how sometimes you really, really want something? Like a Vespa for example. You think it’s the coolest thing ever, in 50’s mint green like Annette Funicello rode in escapade in Florence or those gals in three coins in the fountain. Or maybe in 60’s blue like the wacky mods rode in Quadrophenia. All retro and shiny and perfect. You know you’ll never in a million years get the Vespa. The Vespa doesn’t know you exist. You are not worthy of the Vespa. The Vespa is only for the hip, happening kids. Yet still you foolishly dream of the Vespa. Then one day your friend has a Vespa. He’s pretty and smart, he stands up straight, he’s clever. He deserves the Vespa. He’s the epitome of hip and happening. And even though your head knows all of these things are true, it still hurts. It hurts a lot.  Random thoughts not comedy gold today?  No duh  McFly. You try to stay in the shallow end of the pool with the killing of the brain cells and the blond thoughts but unfortunately, on occasion, some few deadened feelings wake up. (Stupid feelings.) Or maybe it’s just hormonal, haggard insanity.

       Hi, threesome of golf tards ahead of me on the course yesterday, Clearly you cannot read and were raised by wolves and not female mothers or adults of any kind. So, here’s some tips. There’s 3 of you and 1 of me. Let me play through. It even says that on the back of the scorecard. What, I’m invisible because I don’t have a penis?  Clearly.  If you’re almost hit by a pretty pink ball 10 minutes after you’ve teed off, you suck. I suck and I almost hit you. I wonder if a ball from an invisible golfer would hurt if it hit you? Nine practice swings for every ball you hit is not making you better. It does get you called ass wipe at top volume by the player behind you though. But I guess that if you can’t see me you can’t hear me either. Hey, biggest tard of the lot, you’ve hunted forever for every single ball you’ve hit. You suck the best! Start dropping balls. And the ones you “lost” back into my fairways? You’ll never find those in my invisible golf bag. If you’re actually loosing balls backwards I think you should just go sit in the car and fiddle with the radio for the next three hours while your peni superior team mates play the remaining four holes. A note to the hawk on the seventh hole: Yeah it was funny a while back when you were trying to steal Heathers’ ball. But I don’t have time for your predator shenanigans today as I’m busy with the trio of losers. This one woods got a hell of a reach and your head is considerably bigger than that ball. You can’t keep it if you can’t pick it up and fly away with it. Move on.     Oh, now the twosome behind me can’t see me either? Can they see the dope show going on ahead of me? Your penis power is truly awesome. I wonder how your balls kept disappearing or ending up in the creek? Could it be that the woman you’re firing the balls like bullets at in front of you doesn’t like it? Nah, women on golf courses are invisible.  Hey homeless guy trying to sell me a huge bag of golf balls: Oh  you  can see me, great. I’ll bet it’s because I’m alone. No, I don’t want to buy those balls. Number 1, I’m poor and this $7 golf game was worked into the budget and number 2, I’m picking up free balls left and right from the bleeding, wanking, tossers ahead of and behind me. Was it a full moon yesterday or what?

       So, last week I house sat for Veronica* and Heather*. This included taking care of their dog, Todd*, their kitty Paris*, and their fishies Mr. Tickles*. (* All names have been changed because it amuses me.) Todd treated the experience as if he were a live studio audience at his very favorite sitcom of all time. I often imagined I would enjoy being on a show, what with the narcissism and all but now I’m rethinking that. Maybe it’d still be all right with better scripts.  Todd’s favorite episode of the Valerie show was the one where I pluck my eyebrows. This episode was rerun and both times hit number one in the ratings. Me with my nose pressed against the mirror jabbing a sharp piece of metal at my eyes, yeah that’s sitcom gold. His second favorite episode, shown in variations five or six times, was me yelling at the TV. Maybe Todd thought I was talking to him. If “Greenlee you silly bitch” is your name and you know someone named Kendall whose hair needs pulling then yes Todd, I’m talking to you. I didn’t think the shower episodes were worth showing but I was clearly proven wrong when Todd insisted on sitting as close to the closed bathroom door as possible and barking as if an entire herd of mailmen and questionable people with bicycles were invading the house. The episodes Todd did not enjoy: The ones where the laundry room door remained open for more than five seconds and the ones where I would read a book on the porch.  Everything else though, from feeding Mr. Tickles to talking on the phone, Todd feels is box set worthy. On a very special after school episode, audience participation! Is all attention good attention? Todd knows how to do the high five. I find this entertaining in a third grade way. Maybe it’s because I refuse to give the high five to any humans. Or maybe it’s because I never had a pet. Anyway, Todd was all about the high five game for about six minutes. Then he kept it up for another three minutes but with a look of martyred resignation on his face. For another three minutes he was slow to respond, hoping, I imagine, that I would get tired and go away. Next he started pretending he was hard of hearing and that there was something really interesting behind me that I surely wanted to go see about. That went on for five minutes. Finally he pretended there was a pedestrian outside he needed to go bark at, thus ending the very special episode. I’m still convinced all attention is good attention but Todd’s a dog and stuff so he just doesn’t have the attention span to put up with it. I bet if I wanted to do the high five once an hour for the rest of my life he’d be game. Next week! Hear about poor Paris the kittys’ being forced to endure anorexia by the man! Yes, the man is keeping kitty down. Whatever will she do? Tune in to see!

       It’s recently come to my attention that I have become lovable monkey sidekick. What’s that mean? Read on. Back in the day Disney came out with a series of movies where a cute, dimpled college boy would try to teach his pet monkey to play basketball, become an astronaut, foil criminal activities, etc. while also trying to impress, win the hand of, get into the pants of, the lovely Annette Funicello. Wacky high jinks ensued and often the monkey got into danger trying to please the cute, dimpled college boy who would then rescue the monkey thereby moving the lovely Annette. The lovely Annette, being properly impressed with the sensitive, caring antics of the cute, dimpled college boy thus bestowed upon him hugging and kissing. And what does the lovable monkey sidekick get? You know, the one in all the danger? Does he get kisses? Or dates even? No, he does not. He gets a pat on the head from the lovely Annette and a good natured eye roll from the cute, dimpled college boy. Should I embrace my destiny or reject it? After all, every group needs their Eddie Haskell, their Andrew, Potsie, Screech, or Gomer. Their Uncle Arthur, their Major Healy, their Danny Partridge. The hero gets the girl, the quarterback leads the team to victory, the slayer saves the world, the clever scientist defuses the bomb. And through it all the loveable monkey sidekick gets a pat on the head and a good-natured eye roll.   But  god ,  I want more!  I want to be the hero, the rock star, the slayer. Hell, I’d even be happy with the role of evil mastermind whose fiendish attempts to take over the world are thwarted constantly and without fail. Maybe I should try to reject my destiny. Is that even possible? As I race full tilt towards geriatricdom (and the speed of acceleration is making me dizzy I might add) I see another role opening up for me. That of the crazy, bent lady on the block. I’m practically a senior citizen, I could become the nut job who keeps all the balls the kids throw, by mistake, into her yard. That neighbor who loathes humans and is socially maladjusted. Her grass needs cutting and the shades are always closed.           I can’t seem to trade in the pats on the head and the good-natured eye roll for hugs and kisses so I might as well trade them in for having animal control on speed dial and a loaded water pistol by the front door.

       Hey, read this! “You probably have a friend that went to Europe for a month and came back with a completely new dialect. They’d try to make sure you see them ordering baked beans for breakfast, and do their best to mention your apartment so they can call it a ‘flat’. Here’s something else newly cosmopolitan people do after they get back from their trip: if you give them a chance to talk, they’ll relate any event or detail to the country they visited no matter how boring or unmentionable it is. For example, they might interrupt your cocktail party to say, “These olives are dark green. When I was in France, the olives were a much different color. I remember I ate an olive when I was riding the lift over there.” And if you’re honest, you might say back, “you seem different after your trip…ever since you got back, it’s like…it’s like  Europe gave you autism. ” I quoted this from a web site I found recently (I’ll give you the link in a minute) because it sadly and completely describes me. God, for a whole year I’ve been annoying in an eye rolling, shoulder clinching, comma inducing way. What was I thinking?! That I was endearing and entertaining? (well, yeah) And yet you all continued to spend time with me never running from the narcissistic dullard. Or striking me even. I remember in this one episode of friends Monica and Phoebe had this friend who’d spent a year in London then she came back and was driving them nuts with her fake accent and hoity toity affected European ways. It was hilarious but only because it was TV and the friend was played by Jennifer Coolidge and it only lasted 22 minutes. Not so funny in real life is it? So kudos to all of you for putting up with me and I promise to cut it out. But I’m still allowed to write about it. And I’m not giving up the fruity obscenities. Although to give credit most of them came from Mil Millington and from Spike, a character only pretending to be English.    I found the site on my soap opera message board. Link removed* And I have  yet another  hero. In depth smarty pants dissertations of the super friends and their archenemies. My favorite was the one about bizarro superman from the legion of doom. Thanks all my children message boarders and writers of Sealab 2021 for being such hugely clever geeks!

       I had to add this note into the memos section of access today.Followed by what I really wanted to add. Real note: Still expecting one unit against this PO which will never arrive thus assuring that this PO will go past due and we will receive an email every week or so from company* asking us why we cannot repair this unit. We are clearly inferior for being unable to repair a non-existent unit and should be punished because the packers and counters at company* miscounted and mispacked. (*I removed the real name of the company. As highly unlikely as it may seem, someone from that company could one day stagger across my blog and then where would I be? There's a company location in Dundee Scotland. And sometimes I dream that someday, after annoying and alienating  all  of my friends here, I might just pack up and go work for them there. And acquire a whole new set of friends and potential dates to annoy and alienate. It’s good to have dreams. It‘s what separates us from marsupials and non opposable thumbed mammals.) Pretend, in my head, note: Still expecting one more GD unit against this GD PO which will never GD arrive thus assuring that this GD PO will go past due and we will receive a GD email every GD week or so from my GD crack head contact at GD company* asking us, in a completely confused, hand wringing GD way, why we cannot repair this GD unit. We are clearly inferior for being unable to GD repair a GD non-existent unit and should be punished because the GD packers and GD counters at GD company* were freebasing and couldn't anymore care less if they shipped us 108 or 109 GD units than if they shipped us GD flammable lard*. Jackasses. I'm tempted to box up my JarJar Binks stuffed animal(who wears a diaper, a tube top and birth control frames and overlooks my desk and helps me think) and send him to them telling them they sent in a wrong part number. (*I guess all lard is flammable. I guess I should grade the lard. I should have said, food grade, combustible engine lard that burns with a white hot light.)

       Ok, not really saving the planet vs. bizarro superman. I just like to say (type) bizarro superman. Now there’s an anti superhero guaranteed to create nightmares, therapy and children who grow up to become cartoon show writers and use the word bizarro repeatedly as the dialog for an entire episode of sealab 2021.  By saving the planet I mean recycling. I suck at that. It’s  hard . Am I evil because I don’t recycle? Or just a lazy cow. I went to grade school in the early 70’s (make that a lazy,  haggard  cow) where I attended classes on recycling. I.am.not.kidding. Every day with a text book and posters of woodsy the owl and every other bit of tree hugging madness the rest of you think was embellished for television. I remember thinking it was just another thing I’d never need to know once I grew up. Just like dodgeball, math and this game all the girls played where we would get out our tubes of lipgloss and see who could get the shiniest lips and who had the fruitiest smelling lipgloss.   (Oh side story! This one girl fascinated me because her situation was beyond the realm of anything I could conceive. She always had 5 or 6 bottles of lipgloss-yes, it came in glass bottles with a little plastic roily ball for application ease and a screw off top-because her parents would buy her as many bottles as she wanted. Her brother kept taking them, popping out the roily ball and drinking them. Her name was Tawny, his name was Tawn and they were twins. This is all true, they were freaks and I grew up in Tennessee.) Anyway (heavy sigh), I wish I’d paid more attention to those lipgloss lessons. At least now I’d be able to get more…um, shiny lips. I quit using aerosol cans (possibly because they quit making them) and a lot of really good stuff came in those things. And I always cut up the plastic rings from six packs so that the Beluga whales or manatees (they’re the same, right?) and the tuna fish won’t choke on them during oil spills. Sometimes I use old magazines and comic books as wrapping paper. And I always leave crappy paperbacks places where other people can take them and enjoy them, instead of throwing them out the car window. You should see the load of crappy paperbacks I’ve been saving to dump in the doctors’ waiting room when I go for my hag year check up. I would like to be able to buy those fancy pants light bulbs that save you a bazillion dollars a year and last for forty years but the last time I looked they only came in *unacceptable wattages. And were stupid expensive. (*Acceptable wattage = I can hold my hand up to the bulb and see my bones through the skin.) God this has gotten out of hand. Let’s sum up by saying I am taking baby steps towards saving the planet and I’m not evil, just casually wicked. And now, onto the linkin’ logs.Watch out for the pork madness!   urlLink ew, just really,EW       urlLink politically active women need panties too you know.        urlLink The perfect gift for your evil friends who are on the highway to hell      McFly's gonna wet her pants when she sees this(and possibly Veronica as well).    urlLink More people using their powers for evil instead of good.     Just to show you I'm not the most obsessed person on the planet about Spike.    urlLink A bigger freak than me!     Some of these links were stolen (oh, who am I kidding, they were  all  stolen)by digging deep within a link Fred sent me. Fred got the link from her friend but I forgot the friends' name so she doesn't get an alias. Besides, every time I try to give credit for stuff I get a bunch of crap for improper credit assignment so now I can't be bothered. (Well, just this one last time, thanks Fred!) And thanks Rhoda for inspiring me to actually read the tutorial on making words and phrases into the links. You are so clever, I saw it on your blog. And thanks for being a big sucker and adding my name to the list of people that can write in your blog! When I get tired of mucking my blog up I can have a go at yours.    urlLink My very favorite dirty whore    I finally got to see the Buffy musical episode (thanks yet again Fred)and so, having just proven I'm not the biggest geek on the block, I'll end this rant with my, at least so far, favorite quote from it. "If my heart could beat it would break my chest but I can see that you're unimpressed so leave me be and let me rest in peace"-Spike

       The cheerleader uniform costume plan is complete! (Go razorbacks!) Heather got sick of hearing from the former cheerleader every day at the uniform company. (apparently she had a lot of questions about correct colors and styles and stuff. All of which Heather didn’t know the answers to. And by “didn’t know” I mean, “didn’t care”. Heather didn’t have the time or patience to talk to a former cheerleader 5 times a day.) So finally she made me in charge of fielding the calls. Yay me! I love to talk to cheerleaders, they’re so perky. I can’t pull off perky. On me it just looks mentally challenged or drunk. (Hey, I just realized, I do have radar of sorts. I can spot former cheerleaders!)  Ok, this is off the topic of uniforms but still falls under the heading of cheerleader. When I went to that Seth Green movie there was a local high school squad waiting to greet him. Rhoda finally had to smack me in the back of the head I was staring so hard. “Can we please go inside the nice, air conditioned building now?” Rhoda said. “But we’ll miss all the jumping and squealing!” I replied. “Wipe the drool off your shirt or Seth Green is going to think you’re mentally challenged” she said.  Um, I really don’t have any more about the uniforms except we will look great and all the geeky nerds, storm troopers and various and sundered super heroes at Dragon Con will desire us. One more, tiny, sad really, thing. Once I used “were you a cheerleader back in high school?” as a pick up line and it worked. (Honestly, I doubt that was what did it but that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.)

       These movies are bad. So why do I love them? It’s gotta be the cheese.  Honorable mention: Angel High school hookers yay! This girl (played by Donna Wilkes of Hello Larry! Fame and also Jaws II) goes to school during the day and gets straight As then at night she leaves the burbs to be a prostitute. She has to do that to earn money because she doesn’t have any parents, it’s all very suspicious. (I couldn’t be bothered to look up the synopsis on any of these movies to refresh my memory. I prefer to rely on my jaded, confused memories.) So then some naughty boys from her school get killed. They were naughty because they were out looking for hookers,  on a school night!   Lots of overly dramatic crying and cringing in fear and lots of overly dramatic crying and cringing in fear while running full tilt down deserted ally ways and streets. I think there was an older male cop with a heart of gold and a transvestite best friend. Or maybe the killer turned out to be a transvestite older cop with a heart of serial killing. 5) Volunteers This is exactly the type of movie I avoid at all costs these days and even back then. Tom Hanks sucks as a rich kid with a really wacky accent. John Candy sucks as a perky, brain washed moron. The kid that played Long Duk Dong in 16 candles sucks as a slightly less addled but much more put upon Long Duk Dong character. God, what a steaming pile of crap this was. It made the peace corp. look like summer camp. If summer camp involved retards with booze, women and gambling. And yet I will sit through it every time it’s on. 4) Wish upon a Star This is a Disney live action movie from the late 90s. It’s your basic, tired switching bodies movie. In this case two high school sisters, one a surly science geek and the other a perky cheerleader. I know my fondness for this movie comes from the fact that the two young women playing the sisters do so in the exact same way that Bianca and Kendall play sisters on AMC. Uh, huh. I’m going to hell. 3) Troop Beverly Hills I love Shelly Long. My evil radar must go off when I see her or something. In this movie she plays a mother and a troop leader and is so unconvincing at both that it’s painful. Staggering around in high heels with her hair dyed a circus clown orange she leads a troop of equally unconvincing tots to scouting victory. And who thought casting Craig T Nelson in a comedy was a good idea? Also filled with cameos by D movie actors such as Pia Zadora, Dr. Joyce Brothers and Robin Leech. I liked to imagine that Shelly and Betty Thomas were having an affair during the filming. (Bonus! Tori Spelling as one of the tots.) 2) Desperate Lives A late 70s early 80s after school special on the dangers of teen drug use. I think it was desperately edited down from a real movie called angel dusted. Which would explain why it doesn’t make any sense. Helen Hunt is in it but she’s still a child so that merely ups the cheese factor. More importantly, Diana Scarwid is in it. I worship her. (She was the adult Christina in Mommy Dearest and can currently be seen as the mom in Wonderfalls.) She still had her southern accent in this movie and her speech about the pitfalls of dope is priceless. 1) Times Square This movie is terrible. It has to be the nostalgia factor that made me put it at number one. Another late 70s early 80s movie. This one about NY punk girls with mental illnesses. The 2 leads were 13 and 16 years old and they both look 2 years younger than that. It was edited to within an inch of the plot to make it less gay thus rendering it the most senseless, not gay, gay movie ever. The soundtrack is stellar. I had it on cassette and played it so much that it started to die and Joey Ramone started sounding like Tony Bennett. (Then I snatched it out of the player and chunked it out the window of the car. That was my way of showing my disappointment that yet another cassette had died. 2 copies of forever now by the Psychedelic Furs, 2 copies of lets dance by Bowie, the Valley girl soundtrack and various other crap all littering the roads all over the south.) I wish I had the soundtrack on CD but I don’t think it exists. I suppose I could create it myself but that would require effort, which I despise. It’s much more time effective to just complain about it.

       So, a blog is kind of like a diary, isn’t it? That means I could just put any old blathering that comes to mind here. I don’t always have to bother putting stuff in a neat little story or list form. The two people who actually look at this without being coaxed to do so with a cattle prod won’t care. (Which has ceased by the way. The prodding I mean. How hard is it to stop playing Texas poker or free cell for 5 seconds and go check for an update? You know you’ll be disgusted and offended on some level. Gosh, maybe you could, oh I don’t know, bookmark the link? Crazy talk I’m sure.) Right then, off I go. I saw the Village (Settle down, I’m not giving any secrets away) and I’m torn between screaming, “go see it now, hurry up damn you!” so I’ll have someone other than Rhoda* to discuss it with (Rhoda being my partner in crime at the viewing. And *=Rhoda is an alias.) Or screaming, “Don’t see it! Let me tell you and save you from pissing $8.50 away!”  I can make these comments without revealing anything: 1) It’s shot beautifully. 2) Ron Howards’ daughter is in it and thankfully the child received her mothers’ genes in the looks department. 3) Sigourney Weaver was speaking kind of weird. Sort of like her character from working girl crossed with Erica Kane on one of her “trying to distract from the actual topic” rants.   Speaking of Erica Kane, I framed a poster of her recently and hung it over the bar and it makes me cackle with maniacal glee every time I look at it. Erica, in all her 1988 glory, next to a list of all the “men she’s loved”. (I swear to god it says that! The list is 15 years old and it’s still massive.) The poster is advertising 2 very special episodes from February of that year (must’ve been sweeps).  Easily amused I am.  I spent Saturday night catching up on replay TV cheesy goodness and getting toasted. My social life is to be admired and coveted. You’re all just jealous.    I saw another movie last week called without a paddle. No fear of giving any plot secrets away on this one as there was no plot worth speaking of.  Why would I go see a dreadful teen movie you ask? Well, not because Seth Green was in it but because Seth Green was  at the theater . You should have seen the pile of crap with his picture on it that I had in my purse in hopes of getting him to sign it. (Rhoda was with me so I was planning on involving her in my stalking plans. She didn’t know that part.) Alas it didn’t work out but I did get shoved into him. What an adorable young man he is!   Here’s a tip for you: Don’t wear shorts while you’re slinging a weed eater. I know this but continue to ignore it because it’s Africa hot. So now I have all these owies all over me where chunks of glass, asphalt etc. were slung against my flesh at top weed eater slinging force. No bruises mind you (I hardly ever get bruised-must be that hardy cattle stock I hail from) I might could get sympathy if I had a bruise to back the whining up, but the weed eater is a professional model and extra heavy so, bonus, bulgy arm muscles.    Can you tell from my frenzied delivery that I’m back to lovable monkey sidekick mode? Whew! I’m sure you’re relieved. I know I am. Lovable monkey sidekicks should not be depressed, it detracts from their comedy relief. I believe I’ve discovered the key. Lots of vitamin B and beer.
