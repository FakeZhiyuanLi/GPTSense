          Roddick puts friendship aside to douse Schalken fire  By Martin Johnson  (Filed: 01/07/2004) sport.telegraph.co.uk  Wimbledon can be a bit of a lottery for the spectators, not least when you're standing in the "used championship balls" queue. Get one from a 35-and-over ladies' doubles, and it will be more furry than Pete Sampras' chest. Get one from an Andy Roddick singles, and, for the same price, you're liable get something resembling the top of Andre Agassi's head.      Smash and grab: Andy Roddick fires his way into the semi-finals Spectators on Court No 1 for Roddick's match against Sjeng Schalken yesterday would have felt themselves similarly short-changed, as the noise outside from Henman Hill told them that something far more important was taking place elsewhere. It was agony by proxy as the shrieks of "Yessssss!" slowly became outnumbered by the sighs of "Aaahhh", and it is hard to think of a crueller fate than to find yourself watching an unspeakably dull match between an American and a Dutchman while fighting off an overpowering urge to yell: "C'mon Tim!"  Roddick and Schalken are good chums, their friendship forged by a hotel fire during the Italian Open in Rome, in which they helped to rescue a lot of elderly guests (not including Martina Navratilova, apparently) before seeking safety themselves. It all ended with Schalken jumping from his own balcony on the seventh floor on to Roddick's on the sixth ("drop in anytime, Sjeng") and it wasn't too long yesterday before Schalken was left to ponder that every time he bumps into Roddick he finds himself in need of a fire extinguisher.  Roddick holds the record for the fastest timed serve at 153 mph, although there is a suspicion that if the Queen's Club speed gun was used by motorway police patrols, they'd forever be pulling in little old ladies driving Morris Minors. Wimbledon's is reckoned to be more accurate, and yesterday one of his missiles en route to a 7-6, 7-6, 6-3 victory was timed at a Championship record 146 mph.  Schalken, the No 12 seed, was given many more opportunities to wonder why someone who helped him from a hotel fire should now be trying to kill him, but, on yesterday's evidence, once the ball comes back to him, Roddick is a rather less frightening performer, with nothing as subtle in his repertoire as a lob or a drop shot. While Roger Federer's game has been compared to brush strokes from an artist, Roddick hurls buckets of emulsion at the wall.  Schalken, by comparison with his opponent, appeared to be serving with a shuttlecock, but his groundstrokes were heavy enough, and it was more or less a certainty that tie-breaks would be required to separate them. Roddick won the first of them, with the Dutchman suddenly finding the net so often that he should probably have been playing up front with Ruud van Nistelrooy in Euro 2004, and the American narrowly took the second as well.  Midway through the this set, the umpire suddenly announced: "Ladies and gentlemen, play is suspended", which made the crowd wonder briefly - at least until a few drops of rain began to fall - whether it had been called off on quality grounds. Whatever, when play got under way again, half the spectators failed to return.  Even the disputes were unexciting. On a couple of occasions, Roddick made as if to remonstrate with a line judge before thinking better of it, possibly in the realisation that when it came to criticising someone else, he was on fairly rocky ground.  Schalken also wandered halfway towards the umpire's chair for an inaudible mutter, which was pretty wet of him. If you're going to have an argument, at least have a proper one, not least on the grounds that it might have perked the game up a bit. The Dutchman, though, did nothing with conviction yesterday, and had probably convinced himself beforehand that he wasn't going to win. When asked how he fancied his chances, Schalken replied: "Well, my serve is not so good. He can return my serve, and I have a lot of trouble returning his."  This is not the kind of oratory of someone with an unshakeable belief in himself, and reaching the quarter-final was probably as far as he expected to go. The Dutchman has neither great strengths nor weaknesses, which is reflected by the fact that he has been around for the thick end of a decade making just enough money to keep himself comfortable. Roddick did finally step up his game in the third set, but, unlike Rome, this was one occasion on which neither man was in danger of catching fire.

          Another title beckons for Swiss magician who has it all    Martina Navratilova Tuesday June 29, 2004 The Guardian   Every generation has its maestro and for me that's what Roger Federer has been during the last year. He's been magic to watch, partly because he makes it all look so easy and that's always a sign of a genius, to make everything you do seem effortless. He might not have been at his best against Ivo Karlovic yesterday but he still looked in complete control.   Federer could be one of the greatest players of all time, without question. He's certainly got the hands and the balance to be.   These days the modern rackets enable you to do far more with the ball than used to be possible - I know I'm doing things with the ball now that I wasn't able to do before. A lot of players wouldn't know what to do if you put a wooden racket in their hands, but Federer would still be a magician even with a wooden racket. He's got a very compact swing but he generates so much speed and while he doesn't look that strong, he has so much wrist action on the ball and gives it a little bit of extra spin.   Other guys are playing well against him, too, and he's making them look silly. Players have no idea what's coming because he can spin the ball this way and that; he can hit the ball flat; he can serve and volley, ghost in when you're not expecting him or he can stay back. He's got it all.   He's like Martina Hingis with more power and more spins. I don't know what it is about the Swiss, but they seem to produce some fantastic players.   I was lucky enough to play mixed doubles with him in Hong Kong at an exhibition in January this year. When they asked me if I wanted to play doubles with Roger, I asked, "great, how much do I have to pay you?". It was a real treat because he was simply a joy to be on the court with. Then he asked me to practise with him and I got to hit for 45 minutes just one on one, which was phenomenal because I really got to feel how he hits the ball.   When he hits his forehand he can hook it so that he can go cross-court or down the line, tailing away from you because of all the topspin. He can hit a forehand cross-court so that it jumps at your body, which is effective on any surface but particularly on grass because it's almost as though he's inducing a bad bounce because he makes the ball jump differently and that's what his kick-serve does as well.   He's got spin on everything, he's got a heavy slice that stays low, he can float the ball so that it stays low and just dies on the court so you have to create all the pace, or he can knife it so that it skids through. On his groundstrokes he can hit it harder or can hit a cross-court ball that looks like it's going to be no problem until it suddenly takes off in the other direction after it bounces.   Roger looks the part right now and I'm sensing that he is feeling inspired by coming back and defending his title at Wimbledon. It was obvious when he won last year how much it meant to him and how he feels about the place and that's important, because you really have to embrace everything about Wimbledon and grass if you want to succeed here. You could see that even when he beat Sampras in the 2001 quarter-finals. Now Pete has gone and Roger is the king - the man that everyone is trying to get close to.   Because he's a great guy and such a wonderful player, everyone is saying nice things about him but it's important not to buy into the hype about you. Roger has his feet on the ground and I'm sure he's not reading a line of what is written about him. I never read anything that anyone was saying about me, at least until I was out of the singles competition. While it was going on I only ever knew what was happening when the press asked me a question. Reading about yourself can't help you because one way or another it just ends up putting more pressure on you.   Of course Federer isn't the only contender here. Lleyton Hewitt it getting back to where he was and showed that yesterday by getting past Carlos Moya, who has given him trouble in the past but I don't see him beating Federer in their quarter-final. Everyone left in the draw knows that they are going to have to play a heck of a match against the world No1 and even then they will probably still lose. If he continues to play the way he has been, then I don't see anyone taking three sets off him at these championships.   Of course Federer still has things to learn because no one ever knows all that there is to know about the game, but he looks to me like he feels invincible right now. He's undoubtedly the player to beat.

          Federer admits fear of failure  By Stephen Bierley July 7, 2004  All the great players of the past are keen to point out that nobody can be regarded as a true champion until he or she has successfully defended a grand slam title. And that was the fear that stalked Roger Federer throughout the first week of Wimbledon this year.  "Now the sense of satisfaction is unbelievable because the worst thing would have been to lose early," he said yesterday. "To defend the title is just amazing. It was all so new to me and I'm so proud I could handle all the pressure."  Federer summed up his rivalry with Andy Roddick as "Mr Service against Mr Finesse", then allowed himself a minor dig at the man who, for a set, had appeared capable of blasting the Swiss champion off the centre court on Sunday afternoon. "I hit more aces than him," Federer noted.  Roddick will be put to the test himself when he defends his United States Open title at Flushing Meadows in September. And he will know that Federer, who has not progressed beyond the last 16 in New York in four previous attempts, will be aiming to show the American public why he has won three of the past five grand slam titles and is the undisputed world No. 1.  With Federer and Roddick ranked the top two players in the world, the chance that they will meet in major finals has strengthened, although the pressure will be on the American in the US Open.  It looks all but impossible for Federer, having successfully defended his Wimbledon title, to lose the No. 1 spot this year, a position he wrenched away from Roddick at the Australian Open. That was on his way to winning what was his second slam title, one he intends to keep hold of next January.  Roddick, by comparison, was relatively stress-free over the past fortnight and had convinced himself that Federer, to whom he had lost five of his previous six encounters, could be beaten. The tennis world would love it if the Roddick-Federer rivalry developed along the lines of the sport's other great match-ups, principally because the contrast in styles and temperaments makes for such a fascinating duel.  Why all the players - men and women, the current generation and the champions of the past - love Federer so much is that, in an era when power has become so dominant, he has proved that tennis can still be played with subtlety and skill. He has become the model to aspire to, someone to link the sport with its rich past and convince others that there is still beauty in the game.  That is not to say that Federer does not use the strong arm when required, for he can hit forehands and backhands of immense power. However, it is the sheer variety that is so thrilling. Whereas Roddick paints in primary colours, the Swiss master uses the full palette. That is not to denigrate Roddick, who has added more facets over the past 12 months under the guidance of Brad Gilbert, Andre Agassi's former coach. But his extraordinary whiplash serve will always be the core of his game.  "I am never going to serve as fast as him," said Federer. "I would have to change my whole service action. But I can serve consistently and that is what it is about for me."  In fact, some critics fear that Roddick is storing up shoulder or wrist problems because of the severity of his hitting. Federer, however, seems to be playing within himself.  Appearance can be deceptive and, although Federer seemed to be cruising in the opening rounds at Wimbledon, he was inwardly in turmoil. "The pressure I put on myself was unbelievable," he said. "In the early rounds, I did not really enjoy it. Once I got to the semi-finals, the quarters even, I was thinking 'Well, OK . . . I could live with this.' It was my dream to win it again."   - Guardian  quoted from  urlLink  here

                                 Both were invincible except to each other. Roddick was really magic at first. But, under the Wimbledon's sky, all is determined by the one. The battle was to the one who Rain favored. It was Roger Federer.
