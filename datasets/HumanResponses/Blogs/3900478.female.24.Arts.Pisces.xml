      I had a very diversified portfolio for the last few months.&nbsp; I've kind of changed my trading style and it caused me to jump up on the leader board (significantly).&nbsp; Yesterday I was at T$9,821,925.78 and today I'm at T$26,259,810.16.&nbsp; I swear I didn't cheat!! So don't delete my account Satori!!  Instead of holding 30 or 40 small stocks, I reduced my portfolio to just 5 key stocks that I think have some growth potential.&nbsp; Because I put so much money in just a few stocks the prices shot up and my net worth went up (on paper) really high.  Sorry Tom.&nbsp; I'm sure you'll jump me back when I sell off, but I wanted everyone to know that I wasn't doing something too wierd on the market whent the new leader board publishes tonight.

      I’m probably not going to post much today.&nbsp; I want to work on the CSS on my Blog.&nbsp; I don’t really like the pink blog, so I’m trying to learn to fix it.&nbsp; Hope for best for me :)

      I’m amazed that the Philippine troops are pulling out of Iraq.&nbsp; I realize that there were only 55 troops there and they planned to leave in August.&nbsp; But letting terrorists control the military of a sovereign nation is unthinkable.&nbsp; I hope it saves the life of the Philippino captive, but I fear that this will further the terrorists to try to manipulate governments in this way.&nbsp; Once they find a tactic that works, they are going to try it again and again. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Maybe we should have a stock like “Terrorist kidnapers influence sovereign nation by threatening to kill a foreign captive?”

      What are up with terrorists kid-napping people, threatening to behead them, and then let them go?  There should be a strike stock that says that a prisoner is captured/hoaxed and set free.  Speaking of beheading, what do they do with the heads?  It would seem that they would pile up over time.  Wouldn’t they?

      I have just started this blog.  I don’t know if I will keep it up or not.  But I think it’s important for a woman to have a voice though all of the testosterone that exists on the TerrorXchange.  I think this site has its heart in the right place, but I also think that so many people that trade on the site are playing it like a long term video game.  I like to think of the Terror Exchange as a real-time poll of things that may happen.  As such, I’m hoping to provide my own insights as to what may or may not happen in the future.  Happy Trading!!
