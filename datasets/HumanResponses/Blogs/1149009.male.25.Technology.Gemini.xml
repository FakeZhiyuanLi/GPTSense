      I feel so lazy. I've been playing Socom all day. I know, very productive.  It's great. No work, no school. Just killin time.  I have to admit that the keyboard on this X505 is a bit small for my fat fingers.

      If you're reading this with Microsoft's Internet "Exploder"  then the sidebar is seperated from the content, and it really throws off the whole page. Boo.  Hopefully you're using  urlLink Firefox   If anyone knows how to fix this (I'm too lazy to look) then let me know.

      	Can you remember the best or worst day of your life? Is it the same day? There is a single day of my childhood that stands out among the memories. I recall these events with great anxiety and fear, as well as great joy and relief. This day was among the best, and the worst. The day started out like most others. Then an unexpected chain of events lead to an unexpected conclusion. 	As a child in the second grade, life is typically care-free. Eight year old boys usually worry about the new G.I. Joe or Transformer action figure and play set. Getting on and off the school bus was my biggest responsibility. The school I attended would pick up the elementary students at the end of the day and bus them to the high school to wait for those students to board. This lead to about a ten minute wait for the elementary students, who were allowed to get off the bus and play in the courtyard until the high school dismissed. So with that ten minutes of freedom, my friend and I departed the bus and began to do what little boys do best, run and play. However, the daily routine would soon be broken. 	The routine went something like this. The high school students would dismiss and board the buses, followed by the roar of the buses diesel engines cranking up. This was our signal to find our way back to the appropriate bus and get on for the ride home. On this day, however, my friend and I took our time making the short trip back to our big, yellow mode of transportation. We bounced along kicking rocks, jumping from anything we could climb on, and playing in the dirt. For an eight year old boy, the shortest distance between two points is a skewed line. Our pace quickened, however, when we noticed the lead buses pulling away. Running up to our bus we found nothing but a folding, glass and metal door that was shut tight. I can remember the expression on the drivers face. Without a word she said it all, she was making a point, and no matter how much we beat on the door, she wasn’t going to open it. She just shook her head and said, “No”.  My friend and I watched that bus, and many more pull out of the lot. I had never seen that lot empty, until now. It was an unfamiliar territory. 	We started to make our journey on foot, walking up a busy street that lead to the overpass and our neighborhood on the other side of the interstate. I remember being so scared of being run over or picked up by some evil person. The worst thought though, was what my mother was going to say or do. The awful and swift punishment I would receive couldn’t match being run over by a truck. Just before we made it to the overpass, my friends’ mother pulled up beside us. This was all made possible by my brother, who had made it onto the bus in the first place, and was already home. On the ride home, I tried to be as invisible as possible. My friends’ mother let us know how she felt about our adventure. She was not pleased. I knew that I would get the same treatment when I arrived home, and I was petrified. In my minds eye, I could see my mothers’ belt, affectionately known as “White Lightning”, just lying there, waiting to dispense punishment. My friends’ mother dropped me off at my house and I prepared for the worse. However, my wild imagination was wrong. There were no belts cracking, no beatings, no yelling or reprimanding. Only the smell of home-made pizza and the loving embrace of my concerned mother. She wasn’t mad, and she had made pizza for supper! That was too much, I didn’t believe it. 	That day in my childhood is, without a doubt, the worst and greatest. It was an emotional roller coaster that stands out among my thousands of experiences and will remain with me forever.

      In case you don't know who  urlLink Acxiom Corporation  is, they're a company who collects  and stores  demographic data about, well, as many people as they can. Why? Marketing, of course. And as the Architect would say, "...they have become increasingly efficient at it." So, if you're on the grid, you're in their database(s).    However, it seems that their  urlLink data security is not so great.

      Today was a productive day at work. I finished installing a new  urlLink APC XL3000  UPS. Very heavy! Requires two persons to mount in the rack and install the battery. APC recommends you install this 3U unit near the bottom of the rack. Duh.

      So I'm browsing around the blogosphere last night and I read this post about how this guy is using linux on his desktop and has never had a virus/worm(s) or any ad/spy/malware. Great. He goes on to say that his WinXP powered laptop is constantly infected with virus/worm(s) and ad/spy/malware. But, this guy is totally missing the point. He thinks that by virtue of the fact that he's running linux, he's automagically protected by the mighty hand of Torvalds, or something. Sheesh. Don't get me wrong, *nix is great, it ranks right up there with Netware, in terms of stability. So what's my point? It doesn't matter what OS you run, what matters is the fact that your OS is (1) Updated with any patches/fixes. (2) Running adequate antivirus software with current defs. (3) Behind a firewall. At least use NAT, people. C'mon. (4) Only install software from reputable firms. If you install KaZaa to steal music/video/software, then you deserve the ad/spy/malware! That's right, I said it.  Commence flames...

      Ouch, just returned from the dentist. Please kids, if you have a cavity, go take care of it now. Don't wait, like I did, and let it turn into a nightmare.  The office just called; I have an administrators meeting tomorrow at 10am. Great, meetings, a practical alternative to actual work.

      In reference to  urlLink a previous post.   Ok, so I concluded that when I post a picture that is wider than the content column, IE freaks out and refuses to overlay the sidebar text onto the picture. Instead it thinks it should be totally seperate, therefore, it completley moves the sidebar below the content column. IE sucks.
