      This evening when i had a shower i was walking down to my room and looked out the front window at the sunset and it was so beautiful, this sounds so stupid but it was just so amazing i just stood there and watched it for a few minutes and now I'm in a really thoughful mood...there are some people i want to talk to in this thoughtful mood(more like one)but I think that I will save it for another thoughtful day. On another note, we have sex ed again tomorrow and my venus presentation! Prepare to be amazed classmates of mine. I cant think of anything else to say, which is weird for me but i am feeling spacey I will be more generous with words next post.

      Yarg, I am so sleepy, yesterday was Steph's sweet sixteen and I didnt sleep well. I cant believe she is sixteen, thats almost twenty, we're old. Actually im not even going to be sixteen for a while...i still have to turn fifteen. We stayed up late and then after everybody went to sleep i couldnt stop thinking so I stayed awake for a while, sorted somethings out in my head and eventually went to a light sleep. I had a nap this afternoon which was nice but I feel like I've wasted part of my day. I watched waynes world 2 yesterday which was great, i hadnt seen those movies in a while and now I'm saying things like SHWING! and CHA! well i am to tired to continue typing so...bye

      Did you ever have one of those days when you just KNOW everything is going to suck, and no matter what way you look at it it still sucks...and then for some crazy reason it turns out exceptionalty well? Well I did today...We had two subs! and a feild trip!and a movie! and also one of the subs was for casford yay!!!!!! but the math class still smelled bad....and the movie was stupid, in a funny way it was really poor quality with bad actors trying to be dramatic and serious but they werent and i laughed...then after lunch we went to the legislature and that was a little boring because they took 20 minutes to great us (erlack!) and then talked about 3 cents of gas...It would have bean better if they talked about education seing how there were two schools there and no one watching could drive or needed gas but thats just me...it was also creepy how the waitresses had to bow before they came in. Than i had a shower with my sandals on and wrote this and that was my day...wa friken hoo

      Hello friends, family and internet people, wlecome to my blog! Wow...I sound like a freak. This is my first post ever, I hope that you feel special reading it well probably not but anyway...First posts are dificult and I don't know what to write, but this is cool i dont knowwhy I didnt start one of these sooner...This post is going to hell so why dont I talk about my day? that will make things better...Well first of all I over slept, but not in a bad i cant even shower way, my mother fortunatly woke me up only twenty minutes late then i had Math which was great, casford kept using his arms like a monkey which I find really amusing and sometimes laugh during class and no one knows what i'm laughing at and they look at me like i'm crazy... that happened today. and after school bus was sooooooo crowded it was gross i sat with some strange boy named Evan... he kept smiling and I was really afraid for my life but then he got off and Emily came to sit with me so everything was okay... I then went to the mall with my mom and we got my pictures from Sears and she got some jackets, I stayed in the car and people watched and then this guy in a brown rusty car and blaring rap music drove past really fast and made me laugh it was great...then i came home and made this and you are now reading it:) Well...I'm out, I'm tired and we have *shudder* early band tomorrow

      Want to know something interesting about today? June first means there are seven months to my birthday the big 15 haha. I'm not one of those creepy people who counts down there birthday and say things like "My birthday is in 246 days" thats weird. Today was kind of boring, we had presentations all day after break. the one in the afternoon was really interesting though, it was about suicide or S.O.S. (Signs of Suicide)It could have bean better but it was better than i expected. Some people were so immature and it made me really angry i mean, its fascinating the different ways people deal with their problems even if they are tragic. I wished the lady had talked more about causes though, i think some people became restless because they had trouble relating, which is understandable, but she should have talked more about the feelings involved to make it more understandable. It was good though...passed the Jodi test. We have so many projects coming up, its crazy also exams! next two weeks are going to be incredibly difficult we have two tests this week to ugh but then its summer:> I'm really looking forward to the break, I want to do stuff this summer unlike last year where i mostly relaxed, which was fun but lately I've bean feeling more social and outgoing. well i'm done
