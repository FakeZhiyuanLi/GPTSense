          Trapped in this house Just like a prisoner No where to go.  Chains on the door Bars on the windows Damn white walls make me feel sorrow.   Hmmm, I think I will paint.

      Hot water up to my chin  Tears falling down my face  Razor blade in one hand  Just want to leave this place   Slow but deep, now the  other, just as slow just  as deep.   I relax my arms in the water  I close my eyes and now I sleep.

      Standing on a cliff  Looking down upon the rocks  Thinking of my life  Wondering what to do.   High in the sky, a hawk sores by  I look up, and for a moment  I see the answer.   Blinded by the sun, I look  back down. Seeing the smack of the  waves against the rocks are welcoming.   Swaying close to the edge  I close my eyes, stretch out  my arms, take a deep breath  and plummet to my death.   My lifeless body laying on&nbsp;  the rocks. The waves of  the ocean taking me adrift.   Looking down upon myself  Watching until I was no longer  there.   I spread my wings and fly away.

      My dark corner is calling my name The cobwebs are so  welcoming.  Yearning for the comfort of the darkness Needing the comfort, Wanting the comfort.  I'm going to crawl into my dark corner, pull  the cobwebs over myself and cry myself to sleep.

          You got a fast car I want a ticket to anywhere Maybe we make a deal Maybe together we can get somewhere Any place is better Starting from zero got nothing to lose Maybe we'll make something But me myself I got nothing to prove  You got a fast car And I got a plan to get us out of here I been working at the conveience store Managed to save just a little bit of money We won't have to drive too far Just ' cross the border and into the city You and I can both get jobs  And finally see what it means to be living  You see my old man's got a problem He live with the bottle that's the way it is He says his body's too old for working I say his body's too young to look like this My mama went off and left him She wanted more from life than he could give I said sombody's got to take care of him So I quit school and that's what I did  You got a fast car But is it fast enough so we can fly away We gott a make a decision WE LEAVE TONIGHT OR LIVE AND DIE THIS WAY  I remember we were driving in your car The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk City lights lay out before us And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I had a feeling that I belonged  And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  You got a fast car And we go&nbsp;cruising to entertain ourselves You still ain't got a job And I work in a market as a checkout girl I know things will get better You'll find work and I'll get promoted We'll move out of the shelter Buy a big house and live in the suburbs  You got a fast car And I got a job that pays all our bills You stay out drinking late at the bar See more your friends than you do your kids I'd always hoped for better Thought maybe together you and me would find it I got no plans I ain't going nowhere So take your fast car and keep on driving  You got a fast car But is it fast enough so you can fly away You gott make a decision YOU LEAVE TONIGHT OR LIVE AND DIE THIS WAY

          Slow and calm. Soft and smooth. A little tongue. Oh how sweet.  A little faster. More intense. Alot more tongue. Unable to resist.  Longing for that next kiss.

      Darkness is all around me. I'm always alone in this darkness. Shaking and screaming, yearning for light.   Clawing at the walls, trying to  find my way out. Hearing the voices in my head, saying get out, get out.  Scared and alone, darkness is calling. No where to hide. Will have to  just accept it.  I am a prisoner in this darkness.

      Sadness is like a drug You can run from it but eventually it will catch  back up to you.  Why do we bring sadness to the ones that we love. Or do we truely love the ones that we think that we love.  Sadness is breathing down my neck. Closer and closer it gets. Sadness it taking over. I am engulfed.

      How many times should one person find love. How many mistakes does one person have to  make to find that one perfect love. Do we always learn from our mistakes, or will we make the same ones.  Some people believe in love at first sight. Some people end up being alone there whole life.  I hope I have learned from my first mistake. I hope I have found that perfect love.

      Can't imagine going days without being with you. Can't imagine going days without smelling you. Can't imagine going days without talking to you.  Missing you each day that will go by. Thinking of you every second of each minute. Longing to be with you one more time.  I miss you already.

      I feel my air being cut off. Breathing is hard to do. Gasping, gasping, so hard to breath.   Clinging,leaching, needing. Stop smothering me. Just leave me the fuck alone.

      People seem to never see themselves as others do. When I look at my reflection, I see the flaws that I try so hard to hide.  People will tell you that you are beautiful, or handsome. That might make you feel good about yourself for only a little while.  Until your reflection shows back up, and the flaws reappear. The sadness is always near.  So my opion, break all the damn mirrors. I have already had one broke, Hmmmm wonder who I can get to break the rest of them.

      Thought I would entertain you people on the meaning of my title. I am actually unborn, yes that is right i'm still in the womb fighting to stay. I can hear everything from in here. Sounds like a shit hole to me.  Each day goes by and it gets harder and harder to stay.  My cozy home is getting tighter and tighter.  The pressure is unbearable.  I take my trusty rope that is attatched to my bellybutton, lasso it around her precious heart and cling on for dear life.

      I open my arms to death. I search for the big Grim Reaper. Death is always one step behind us. Welcome it.  I welcome death. What is taking so damn long?

          I think I will not blog anymore. Or at least for sometime. I have decided to take all the pain, the hurt, the tears, the fears, and the sorrow, I will be using all this mixed up energy for my paintings.  Until another time Goodbye.

          Tears falling down my checks They seem to come everyday Hate that they make me so weak.  Trying to understand Longing to be hand in hand uncontrollable they are Unable to stop.  Wet and salty Dry and damp The one last drop Will be the end.

           Tired of being me, plain and ugly.  Tired of being me, short and chunky.  Tired of being me, light skin, and freckles.  Tired of being me, so unhappy.  Tired of my skin that I am in.

          I'm not out to hurt him I tore his world apart Now he walks around with a broken heart.  Frown upon his face Darkness in his eyes All he wants now is to leave this place.  To tell him i'm sorry, will do no good He wants to hate me So the hate I understood.  One day he will find where his road leads, rather it's with me or it's to be free.
