       urlLink    This is my boyfriend, Alex Murray. As he is one of the most important people in my life, I thought he should go first. This picture was taken after we had gone to Thorpe Park together with some other mates. I'm loving the hat! &nbsp; urlLink

       Hee hee, party last night at my place. Was wicked fun, six of the people (including myself) stayed on late and boy, did we have some fun! So, here are me and Georgia to give you all the gory details!  In the pool, there was the "Inflatable War". Lilos and inflatable dogs at the ready! Then, people got out and errr, got changed! hee hee, boys hold onto your boxers in future. One pair, namely Alex Murray's, got brutally savaged by the girls! They were pretty rankâ€¦  Hee hee, after a few drinks and some "quality circle time", all sat down to watch Scary Movie 2.. Great film. You gotta admit it. That finished and most people went home. However, my two girlfriends, Harri and Georgia, were staying the night and Murray's parents forgot about him, Rob and Mark. So they stayed for a bit too. Heehee, many silly hats were worn and many "stoned-looking" pictures taken, sooooo.... without further ado, I give you, The Motley Crue!      The pictures are all below

        urlLink     Sylvie and Catherine mutilated Alex Murray's boxers. Disgusting children.. I was truly horrified, as was Rob! I don't think Murray was too happy bout it either! It was a truly hideous sight. Please girlies, calm yourselves! This unsightly underwear is currently festering in my bin.... Tomato ketchup, cheese and chive dip, cheese, pretzels and BBQ sauce are not a healthy mix   urlLink

       urlLink     This one was taken shortly after playing a game which involved throwing balls at Murray's velcro hat. It's very, very fun. We were very hyper at the time... high on air, you might say! We did have immense fun and this game is one of the best! How silly does he look?!?!

       urlLink     Murray also in a hat, not as silly as the other one though! However, he does look very cute, if not like an old woman! There are many different pictures of this moment, each funnier than the last.... Heehee, my bed has been transformed into Comedy Central! some great moments caught on camera woooo!

       urlLink     Harri in a very silly hat. She also look quite stoned! Hee hee, oh so, sexy, Harri m'dear! She was very displeased that I managed to get this photo and put it on the Internet! Well, my parents thought she had too much to drink! HAHAHA.. she had less than me! My dad was telling me to ask Harri to drink some water and I was standing there swaying and trying to focus properly! However, I WAS NOT DRUNK!!!!! NOT EVEN TIPSY, so there!

       urlLink     Rob in a silly hat! Rob lives near Alex and is very cool, except he kept telling me I was drunk and calling me a frog.... So not true.. And what the hell is with 'calm down, sandra'?!?!?! I don't think he likes this picture. However, I think he looks very cute! Rather like an old woman... or not! Well, more feminine than usual, anyway! But, we definitely had fun... and lots of it too.... BUNDLE!!!!  urlLink

      today is a very boring day for humanity everywhere, so i think. so therefore i have decided to share my holiday boredom with the world and post it. i am very bored. i have sat at home doing jack shit all day and am therefore about to kill myself.  my dad has just come home from storming out of the house this morning, which is practically a ritual in this household, and my mother has just come home with some lovely lycra cycling shorts for me to wear in PE. my sister is off in town with her boyfriend who's just come home. and thus the sheer boredom continues. i think i may go for a walk to calm my nerves. I have nerves of steel, mind, and so they don't need much calming. but even so. it might be nice to get out of this god forsaken hell hole. hmm. i don't like walking around here, you get beaten up by a million pikeys.

         ...and now for something a little less boring from Harri, I hear ye say.   well okay.   *pauses trying to think of something to say not involving music*   *only thing that comes to mind is religion and Harri realises she doesn't want that sort of mess to come about from this post*   Oh dear.   (on a side note, i am very happy that i finally managed to get SnakeNet radio to play on my p.c.! i have to do a lot of weird things involving iTunes but i still got it! YESSS! METAL RADIO! music currently playing: Possessed - Beyond The Gates)     I would like to add a reply to sarah's last post. Altough i love you muchly sarah, I have to say right now i'm not loving so many of you who i thought i did. You know who you are. I am very very annoyed with you because i don't know what exactly i have done (or what you have done, for that matter ^o)) that means you get stressy with me when i try to find out. Hey, i'm not having a particularly great time right now, so do ya reckon you could cut me some damn slack?      Enough rant.   Remember, life is good, life is fine, life is great. Life is utter shite.

       Even when everything looks like it couldn't get any worse, everything suddenly gets better again! Like you could go on a date, or you could make up with a best mate, or you could throw a party! Either way, in your lowest, deepest, darkest moments, there'll always be those who'll stand up for you and keep you going.    You might not be best mates with them, you might not even like them... but it's those people who keep the world going. There are loads of people who have made my life at the moment the best it's ever been, but there's one person who I know I can always turn to, and who has always been there for me.    ----------

       Yes, I do know what you did last summer. You sat in your garden, or on holiday somewhere, soaking up the sun in the heatwave! Great, you may say... nope.   This summer started out the same. Sat by the pool, sipping a cocktail, getting a nice tan. Then, one unfortunate day, you notice a cloud looming over your so-far promising summer. And just like that, the rain starts. First, Hurricane Alex, then Tropical Storm Bettie, and now Hurricane Charley. So, in short, fuck Florida for sending us there shitty weather!   I have reason to believe that Hurricane Charley is going to severely disrupt my party, and I am very displeased at this! Why is it that last year was glorious sunshine aaaall summer and this year has been truly crappy? Because England's weather completely sucks!   This summer has been like living in a bloody rainforest. It's hot and humid, then it rains alot, so everything is wet, hot and humid. When it stops raining, we all race outside to grab as much sun as possible before the next downpour. Nothing can ever get dry, because as soon as it starts drying off, it rains again. So, all outside furniture and any other poor things you may have left outside will spend their entire summer wet and slowly decomposing.   This post wasn't that exciting. But, I'm very cross at the moment. It's sunny right now, but there is a huge black cloud hanging over Basingstoke, which is where I'm going later. Oh, joy.... I can't wait to stand in the rain, huddle under an umbrella, and then run to shelter in the 5 minutes between showers. Grrr... it pisses me off.. just as you start venturing out from the shelter you have found, the rain comes down in all it's glory!    But, the worst thing is, England doesn't make an effort to store any of this water, in case of drought. No, they say, it will rain again. After all, it always rains in England. It's like the fact that England is the windiest European country and yet we have almost no wind turbines and even the ones we try to build, people complain about.   Anyway, I'm starying slightly from the point here, my point was the weather sucks and don't we all know it! Stupid meteorologists.... ruining my day         Peace,

      Since this is The Most Important Thing In My Life, I have decided to do my first post on it.  Some unimportant (for you, but very important for me) facts: I play the guitar, sing and used to play keyboard. My favourite type of music is metal, which i have come to find a hell of a lot of people don't like.  Which is a shame, because it has some of the best guitars, drummers and *cough* vocalists you are likely to find in the current music business (not that the so-called underground bands like to count themselves as in it). Something that pisses me off about this is the fact I can NEVER find a CD by an "unknown" band I like in the CD shops.  One example of this would be Razor, a great thrash band from the 80's which just seems, if you go by these shops' stocks, to have never existed.  I suppose this would make sense, as most people don't like it and the shops have to buy because of demand, but I reckon that even if they just stocked a couple of copies of their CDs this would be enough.  They are cutting out a huge portion of music which just isn't right and it doesn't help the consumer.  Anyway, enough about that. If anyone has any thoughts on that, or anything else, or if ya just wanna tell me how great metal is :P, don't hesitate to post!

       There are many different views on love in our teenage years. Some people say that it's a load of bulls*** and you can't fall in love at 15 or whatever. Others say that you can be in love with someone, but it's a different kind of love: Teenage Love.   I don't know whether it exists or not, but I've been in a relationship for 6 months (today!!) and I know you can have some pretty strong feelings about one person. I think it's wrong for one person to say, 'Oh, you can't be in love. You're too young' or whatever. No-one really knows what love is, except that it's a feeling, and no living person could possibly determine exactly what another is feeling, however hard they might guess.   Different people in different relationships may have different views of love. Some may feel that they love someone even if they do not particularly like them, but others might think the really like someone, but could never love them.   I just don't see how "teenage love" would be any different to any other kind of love... it's a feeling and feelings can't be divided up into sections according to how old you are! A baby could be just a happy as an old person. A child can hate something as much as their parent can.    It's up to the one in question to decide whether they're in love. They might not realise that they love someone. Their love might grow rather than be "love at first sight". However they love someone, their age cannot determine their feelings!   That's all a bit confusing and contradictory, but what the hell      Peace,

       The following passage is not my original work, but a speech made as an English assignment by someone in my class... I'm not sure if they want naming, but it was a really moving speech and it made you think alot about self-harm and the damage it can do... So here it is...         "Teenagers all around the world are unhappy with their lives. Some more than others. Everyone has a different way of dealing with their problems, whether they are caused by family, friends or just life in general. If you ask a teenager â€˜Are you happy with your life?â€™ what are the chances they will actually say yes? Even if a person looks happy and is always smiling, they might be hiding feelings from the world. We all know how much pressure we have on us. Many people cannot cope with this pressure and find ways to release it. And Iâ€™m sorry to say, that many teenagers nowadays, turn to drugs, abuse and self-harm.           However, even if a person does these things, they are still normal, they still have feelings. You should not hate them for being different. So... ok, they have a weird way of releasing their anger and stress, but would you rather they did these things or keep their feelings locked away inside? Adults try to get teenagers to talk to them, to tell them what is wrong. But, be honest here, if you mum was upsetting you in some way, would you tell here to her face, â€˜Mum, you are the reason Iâ€™m upset all the time.â€™ Would you sit with her and talk about all your problems? I wouldnâ€™t, and most of the people I know wouldnâ€™t.           Self-harm isnâ€™t all that bad. It is just a way of letting out pain and stress. By self-harming people are turning emotional pain, into physical pain. They are not trying to kill themselves or seeking for attention. Iâ€™m sure that you would not tell anyone if you were hurting yourself because of depression. You would try and hide it. But people donâ€™t allow self-harmers to hide their scars. Rumours are spread; people are called weird by their best friends, even their family. Everyone ignores them, says they are seeking for attention, but they arenâ€™t. They would much rather be treated normally, we all have feelings, and many of us know what its like to be bullied and have rumours spread about us. Treat others, as you would like to be treated. Isnâ€™t that what we are always taught?           I donâ€™t understand why everyone hates self-harmers. They are no different from anyone in this room, except they are full of pain inside. A pain that weighs them down, a pain that they cannot get rid of, a pain that is only made worse by their friends discarding them; leaving them on their own. It might make you feel better; make you feel stronger, as though you are better than your friend who needs your help now more than ever. Would you rather you felt good, than make someone who needs help happy? If you were asked you would say that you would help the person who is feeling down. But would you actually help them in real life? I know for a fact, that many of you wouldnâ€™t.           There are other ways to release anger and stress. One of which is to write poetry. Many see this as a better option, but if your friends read your poems tell people what your write about; death, blood, suicide, hate, the same will happen. Many wonâ€™t like you; your friends will call you a â€˜freakâ€™ say you shouldnâ€™t be allowed to see other people in case you â€˜infectâ€™ them. They call you names and say your poems should be reality. I can tell you now, that this will make people feel a greater pain inside, one that cannot be rid of by writing your feelings on paper. This is when people begin to turn to self-harm. For some the easiest way to rid yourself of pain and anger, is to cut it out."

       I am a fan of punk and emo bands, as many of you will know. So much so, that Harri once called me a 'lil emo biatch!' and it stuck. so there!       Sugarcult    One of my fave bands at the moment is Sugarcult and anyone who also likes that kinda music should check them out. Their most recent album, released in 2004, is Palm Trees and Power Lines. The band consists of Tim, on vocals, guitar and songwriting, Marko on guitar, Airin on bass and vocals and Kenny on drums. The band's debut album, Start Static, was released in 2001 and the band have been huge ever since! To find out more about the band you can visit the official website, which is  urlLink www.sugarcult.com         The Starting Line    This band is also one of my emo favourites. Introduced to me by one of my closest mates, Ben Coles, god of all things emo, I have loved the band since I first heard them a while back. There's four mebers of The Starting Line; Kenny Vasoli on bass and vocals, Tom Gryskiewicz on drums, Matt Watts on guitar and Mike Golla on guitar. The band released their debut album, Say It Like You Mean It, in 2002 and it sold over 300,000 copies! To read more about the band and to hear some of their music, go to  urlLink www.startinglinerock.com         Hoobastank    I first saw Hoobastank new video and single, The Reason on Kerrang! TV and thought the song was awesome. So, I checked out the new ablum, also called The Reason, and I have to say, it's pretty cool. The band's members are Doug Robb on vocals, Dan Estrin on guitar, Chris Hesse on drums and Markku Lappalainen on bass. Their website is  urlLink www.hoobastank.com  if you wanna hear more.       Jimmy Eat World    Last summer, me and my mate, Georgi, went to Devon together and spent the entire week listening to Jimmy Eat World's fourth album, Bleed American (2001). Some of their previous album's hadn't been as good, but we immediately fell in love with this album. They have a new album out, called Futures, which is due to released October 19. I don't actually know anything about the band, but if you wanna look into it, I do know that ther official website is  urlLink www.jimmyeatworld.net         All-American Rejects    I know some people hate this band and yell at me whenever they are mentioned, 'They are such rejects! They sure chose a fitting name! They could have called themselves 'The All-American Retards!' *cough* Cat *cough*. However, I think their music is good, being of such weird taste as I am. Their self-titled album has some wicked songs on it frankly! The debut album, 'The All-American Rejects' was released in 2003 and their first single, 'Swing, Swing' was a smash hit! So, in the band, we've got Tyson Ritter on vocals and bass, Nick Wheeler on guitar, keyboards and programming, Mike Kennerty on guitar and Chris Gaylor on drums. For more info on the band go to  urlLink www.allamericanrejects.com           AFI    As a few, or many, people know, AFI is also known as A Fire Inside. Ther are four members; vocalist Davey Havok, guitarist Jade Puget, bassist Hunter and drummer Adam Carson. They released their first album in 1995, Answer That and Stay Fashionable. After a series of many other albums, their latest being Sing The Sorrow (2003), the band are still hugely successful in the USA and the UK. If you wanna hear all their other albums and learn about the band's whole history go to  urlLink www.afireinside.net     That's only five bands, I know. The list goes on, but I couldn't be arsed, so I just put some top bands on there... Other bands to look out for are:      Dashboard Confessional   Bowling For Soup   Story of The Year   Something Corporate   Yellowcard   Taking Back Sunday   New Found Glory   Less Than Jake   NOFX      if there's any bands who should be here, but aren't post a comment and I'll add them happily (unless it's crap)      Peace,

       It's coming up to my six-month anniversary with Alex, and I have no idea what to get him! Guys are really hard to buy for, and here is why!   You can't buy them jewellery unless you're willing to spend a fortune on a piece of string in Hard Edge or some other rip-off shop. You can't buy them chocolate, because even thought they may like it, guys just don't eat chocolate like girls do! You can't buy them CD's 'cos you never know if they've already got it or if they're gonna like it. Unless, of course, you ask them, then they know what they're getting. Yo ucan't buy clothes 'cause you never know if they will fit, or if they'll even like it. And decent clothes these days are expensive. You can't buy underwear, because you just can't! See, I can buy underwear for my girly friends, but you can't just buy underwear for guys. That's silly! You can't buy make-up, 'cause guys don't wear make-up.    See, I think my point is proven...   However, I have made a shortlist of things I'm gonna get him... including guitar picks, an Iron Maiden poster and a big bag of Softmints (he asked for the picks!).    Lol, so if anyone knows what you buy for a 15-year-old guy, then pleeease tell me 'cause I'm very, very, very stuck!       Peace,

       I'm really pissed off at the moment. Mainly with my parents. They just are always intent on ruining whatever I decide to do. They don't trust me. They always want every single detail and they never let me do anything my own way. Anyway, moan over, this is my "blog" and it's just going to have random little things put on it. if you're reading, then you're mad. If you think I'm talking crap, feel free to say so.    A word of advice: Yell At Old People: it's fun. Then you can run away and they'll never catch you. heehee.. clever or what?! Oh yeh, and cry sometimes, even if you're a guy, because crying is fun and it doesn't actually make any sense but it makes you feel good afterwards. However excessive use of this tip can give one hell of a headache and pretty sore eyes.    Also, another cool thing to do if you're feeling really pissed off is write a list of things that are pissing off, this can include people, and then rip it up into little bits and burn it! Then make another of things that will make you feel better and do all of those things, however insane or difficult.    I know I'm probably just going crazy, but who gives a fuck because I'm really, really, really pissed off. If your dad made you hang up to your boyfriend who you weren't gonna speak to for another two weeks even though it's your sixth month anniversary next week, would you be pissed off? If the answer's no, then you're a very tolerant person. Aaaaanyway, must be off, so keep watching the skies, and burning lists and yelling at old peple and crying! woo you might learn something whoooo knows!       Peace
