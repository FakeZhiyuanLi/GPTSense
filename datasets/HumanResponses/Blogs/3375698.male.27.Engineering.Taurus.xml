      Looking back over the last year, I stand in absolute amazement over the breadth of depth of changes that have occurred (or will soon be occurring) in all of our lives.  It seems that all of us have faced or are facing major changes, some of which were forseeable and many that were not.  The ending of freedom (school) and the beginning of enslavement (work) [or merely the changing of slavedriver].  Relationships and friendships started, some that are no longer, and some that are forever changed.  I cannot recall any other year in which so many of us have been affected so much.  It is as if we were all pawns on a great chessboard and a great hand, bored after having nothing to do for so many years, reached down and re-arranged all the pieces.  I cannot really explain it, why should this year be so different from all the previous?  I suppose I could be mistaken, maybe this year was no different.  Maybe I just wasn't paying as much attention to those around me before, but seeing the amount of inner turmoil and pain in my friends' hearts, I very much doubt that.

      As you'll notice, I put up  urlLink Brandon's  request for a poll question.  In order to give you, the reader, the opportunity to affect the discussions on this forum, I will gladly entertain requests for both poll questions and Blog topics.  In other blog-related news, I've removed the hit-counter because it wasn't working like I originally thought it would (it didn't count each "visit" as one hit, but rather every post viewed).

      ... to whomever else thought I was on the verge (or already had) lost my mind.  I would have voted for myself too, had I not put that silly ground rule in place.  As they say, "great minds think alike"... I wonder if that saying stays true for those with crazy minds???

      Earlier this week I was watching "Paycheck" with some of my friends, when one of them who had already seen it commented that I would be upset with the fundamental scientific premise of the film.  If you havn't seen it yet (and for some reason have a desire to) and don't want one of this premise revealed, you should probably stop reading this blog.  As an aside, I generally don't really care if films use flimsy science... maybe at some point in my life I did, but now I usually find it entertaining to watch how Hollywood warps current science to their artistic ends.  Anyways, in Paycheck the main character develops a "crystal ball", based on the following theory: light from past events travel to the edge of the universe where it wraps around, eventually heading back to its source.  I think that most people would find this premise extremely laughable, and not based on any scientific reasoning at all, however, such people would be wrong.  Until recently, this was actually a respected theory, thought plausible enough so that there was a  urlLink study  to refute it (mostly).  Of course, the movie exaggerated the theory a bit, for example, based on the theory you would only be able to see events from billions of years in the past (however long it took the light to reach the edge of the universe and come back again) not anything that would happen in the future.  Now to the point of the blog... because of this, I got to thinking about the state of science in general.  Most especially that involving the creation, evolution, and destruction of the universe.  I don't know how many of you actually keep up to date with such things, but there is getting to be less and less actual science in this field.  Science is based on the development of TESTABLE theories, which are subsequently tested over and over again in a never-ending cycle of refinement.  Many of the new theories coming out now, though, arn't currently testable - and in all likelihood never will be.  Not unless we can actually build something (like in Sliders) that can traverse into parallel universes, extra-dimensions, or allow us the ability of time travel.  For example, there are theories about the existence of other universes and how fundamental constants of science (such as the charge on an electron) may be different in these universes.  How the hell would you test that!?, and more importantly, what relevance does this have to anything???  Now, it could be that this is the only scientific field that is becoming "non-science", but I have a feeling that it's only a matter of time before others join up.  Now, others have prophisized the end of scienctific development before (I am reminded of just such a prediction made during the 19th century), but truth be told, it is becoming harder and harder to see that we can keep up the pace of development forever.  We are at the point of controlling the fundamental particles or nature and being able to construct them as we see fit, information now travels at (or near enough) the speed of light, and we are very close to being able to change our own genetic makeup to whatever we want - in effect being able to control our own evolution.  Now, I do not have a crystal ball myself, I cannot see the endless possiblities that may be... but I have often asked the question "What it there left to do?"  Man starts off with no understanding of the world and so places faith in God to help explain it.  Eventually, faith in God is replaced by faith in science, and in so doing learns to control his world.  After obtaining this control, what is it that man will do, and in what will his faith be placed in order to obtain it?

      I'm not planning on making a habit of writing diary-like entries, but as I'm too tired to think coherently at the moment... and sorry in advance if you consider this post a complete waste of your time.  Actually, I'm doing remarkably well for only 4 hours of sleep.  Usually I'd be pretty much comatosed.  Oh well, we'll see how well I hold up throughout the day.  On the plus side, I remembered that I don't have to go to UW today - I'm allowed to skip one seminar, and since I have to go next week anyway (to pick up my graduation tickets / gown), I might as well take today off ;)  At the moment, I also have this strange feeling of a inner peace.  Although, I can't quite be sure of the why of it (no great conflict in my life has been resolved or anything), it is nonetheless a very comfortable feeling and one I hope will last.  I suppose it could just be a side-effect of exhaustion, but regardless of cause, I'm doing quite well at shrugging off things at work that would normally get me riled up.  OK, I think that is quite enough aimless wondering on my part.  Time for me (and anyone who is reading this) to get back to doing something more constructive.

      While looking through some of my old files, I found the following assignment from one of my Classics classes.  We were told to write a story or poem based on some sort of mythology (I chose Tolkien's) and it needed to involve a metamorphosis.  The reason I'm posting this is that there are three characters that I ended up using as RPG names: Elenril, Nephredil, and Telperion.  Since I've already given a brief synopsis of Siendel's beginnings, I figured why not post about how these three came to be.  For those unfamiliar with Tolkien mythology, Telperion was the predecessor to the moon who was eventually cut-down by Melkor (Sauron's boss). Some of you know Telperion as the Psionist D&D character that pissed Steve off so much.  Elenril (name means "bright star") was my first Ultima Online character, and Nephredil (named after a flower that only blooms under starlight) was the only girl RPG character I ever played - ended up being my main UO character (a fighter/mage/tailor).  Oh well, enough background, here's the poem [as an aside, for those of you who know what an acrostic is, this poem has one]:  Two trees alone rose above the earth in the sacred gardens of Valinor,  Each one lifting up their boughs, high enough to touch the stars. Light falling from one as silver, the other as glittering gold;  Powerful Telperion was named the first, golden boughed Laurelin the other. Eldar tell of their bringing forth the first light to Middle-earth; Rising to full flower first was Telperion, and as he faded Laurelin grew. Interwoven were these two, alternating night with bright day. Of the Ainur only Yavanna, giver of life, knew of their true origin; Not till now has she allowed this tale to be told:  Ages ago, even before the count of time,  Night eternal blackened all of Middle-earth; Darkness surrounded and destroyed all that was of worth. Long did Yavanna walk this barren land, seeking to end her strife,  Always searching for a place where to bring forth life. Under water and under stones small plants she caused to grow, Reaching upward from the ground fruit trees began to show. Eagerly now she sought to make something more than these, Life to walk and play amongst her fruitful trees. In hidden vales she caused to rise the first of life anew,  Night concealed two human forms each with heaven’s hue. First to wake was Elenril, more brilliant than a star,  Only to Varda did he yield, queen of all Valar. Rising next came Nephredil, fairer than a rose,  Evening dawned around her, stars sprinkled about her toes. Verily so passed the night with the shining stars above,  Engaging in the passion of one another’s love. Rising from his slumber, the Father knew something was amiss,  Infuriated he became when he caught the two in kiss. None else were to waken before the firstborn Elves,  Then were the dwarves to rise, deep within their delves. Enraged as was he, Iluvator listened to their case, Reading their hearts he relented, saved were they by his grace. Where once they stood he transformed them instead to trees; One of silver, it’s new-formed branches swaying in the breeze; Violets coated the other, whose new leaves were lined with gold; Eastern stars gave way to the first daylight, rising above the seas; Now as one, are the two entwined, with branches in ever-grasping hold.

      ... for dwelling on past regrets, or for worrying about things that you cannot change (or as is more often the case, worrying about things that you have chosen not to change).      Right now, I'm kinda reminiscing on a post Brandon had made sometime ago, where embedded within it was his comment that are lives are ruled by a green piece of paper that was technically worth nothing.   This statement kinda reminded me of the whole "money can't buy happiness" cliche.  My particular take on this is that, on the whole, the statement is true... money by itself doesn't make you happy or unhappy.  However, it does have a great deal of impact on whether or not we spend our lives constantly distracted from the things that do make us happy.  The most notable distraction, of course, is work, which all of us (for now at least) must do so we can eat and have shelter.  And unless we are planning on having a early death, most of us have to keep working until we are so old that we are no longer able to do the things that do make us happy.    In my particular case, I'm happy when I'm trying something new, doing something I've already tried and enjoyed (such as hiking), or going places I've never been before... and I'm most happy when I'm doing these things with people I care about and who also enjoy the experience.    Unfortuneately, all of these things require time... which work silently sucks away from us.  Most "happy" experiences in life also require money (pretty much anything other than just being with someone you care about), and generally, the more rare the experience the higher the cost.  Which presents us with the following conundrum: work takes time and is needed to get money to live, but time and/or money is also needed in order to do things that make you happy.  So, your choice is to either live (and be unhappy) or be happy (and well... dead I guess).  Suffice it to say, most people select the former option and choose to have hope that someday they will have enough money and time to both live and be happy.  Of course, if the things that make you happy don't happen to cost anything, or if you happen to be among the rare few that are actually happy working, then well, this blog really doesn't apply to you and you should have stopped reading it long ago.  I suppose Tman fits this description... he is happy not doing anything, completely content with his boring life (his words, not mine).  Well, as I said at the beginning, life is too short... so I'm going to go do something I enjoy - taking a long walk to the nearest Starbucks and get me some coffee before class.

      I figured I needed to take a break from my school work, before I lose the last of the little sanity I have left.  So, what better way to spend these few precious moments than writing a blog about the most trivial of matters... Who is Siendel?  Going way, way back, to a time in the distant past, to an age now long gone... to the dawn of online gaming.  This was a simple time, long before the hellspawn that was Everquest was unleashed upon the world.  It was a time of text-based gaming in worlds where 100-200 people within them seemed crowded.  Within one of these worlds, a world now long dead, Siendel was born.  He was not my first character in this world, nor my last.  He was probably not even the most powerful, however, he was by far the greatest character I played in that world (and perhaps the funnest I ever played), and here is his story...  Siendel was born as a true-neutral, Zen-like warrior, proud in his strength, but temperate in how he applied it.  Fighting with other warriors and wizards at his side, Siendel gradually gained experience and eventually reached early man-hood (about level 20/60), and at this time, he finally began to take an interest in the world around him.  This was not a world ruled soley by man (or dwarf, elf, or other mortal creatures), it was a world ruled by an elite group of gods.  These gods also happened to be the programmers of the world, and each had their own particular personality, not unlike the gods of the ancient Greeks.  Well, it so happened that one of these gods (whose name as long escaped me) started the creation of new power... The Empire.  The stated goals of this empire was to bring order and law to the world, to clean up the chaos that had been plaqueing it.  Siendel was still young, and naive, and thought these were worthy and noble goals, and as he wished to join something greater than himself, he joined up.   Well... he should have noticed something was amiss when he was forced to pledge undying loyalty to The Empire.  The moment he did, his life was changed forever.  The first thing he noticed was that he was no longer neutral... his alignment had been shifted to evil!  The next thing he noticed was that a lot of his powers had been taken away, punishment for neglecting his chosen path in life.  Siendel was horrified.  Wishing to change his condition, Siendel prayed to the other gods and goddesses of the world for assistance.  When they did not answer his call, he sought out their ancient and hidden resting places, temples to their particular orders. He eventually found one whose ideals were similar to his new ones (which consequently were the exact opposite of those of The Empire).  He met with the great goddess, and gave an impassioned speech of how he was misled and wished to changed his chosen path in life.  The goddess listened, and was sympathetic, but she said she could not interfere, she said that Siendel had chosen his path and now he must walk it.  At that moment, Siendel's beliefs in the absolute goodness and fairness of the gods (at least of the supposedly good ones) was forever thrown aside.  He now longer cared for currying favor from them, and he had no intention of blindly accepting his fate.  From that moment one, Siendel was his own persona.  Returning back to his hometown, he made a decision, even if the gods would not allow him to be "characterally" transformed to good (or even back to neutrality), he would fight for good in the world regardless of whether it was dutiful to the gods or not.  Unfortuneately, the rules of this particular world were such that he was punished (via experience loss) for each evil thing he killed, and only rewarded if he killed good things.    Completely uncaring for his personal pain, however, he traveled the length and breadth of the world fighting great battles against the evil things that plaqued it.  He publicly bashed the gods and called them down for the injustice they had wrought him, and he was especially vehement against The Empire.  This caused Siendel to find himself in quite a few scuffles, however, by far it was more often for his sword to have pierced his enemies hearts than it was the other way around.  At some point, it actually came to pass that it was easier to start a new character and bring him up to Siendel's age than it was for Siendel to gain in age himself... but that did not deter Siendel from continuing on his campaign.  Eventually, I moved on from this world, and Siendel was layed to rest.  But there will come a time for him to rise from the ashes, and for him to continue on his crusuade.  While we wait, this blog will remain a living memory to this character's greatness...

      Well, at the urging of a couple of my friends, I have finally started my own Blog.  The gates to §iendel’s Lair are now open.  Sorry in advance if I disappoint any of you, but I’m not so sure you will figure out the inner-workings of this “ urlLink mad-genius ” from the few random thoughts I post here from time to time... but we shall see.  Now for some ground-rules:  I have come to understand that we all have various locked rooms of our pysche, containing thoughts, memories, and emotions that we tend to keep hidden from the rest of the world.  These rooms are only accessible to those who have been given the proper keys to unlock them.    As my friends, you each have your own set of keys, unique to yourselves, that you are free to use in the real world to open up whatever hidden chambers of my mind that I have given you access to.  The numbers and types of keys will vary amonst you, and as our friendships evolve and change, more metaphoric keys may be added or, in some cases, taken away.  But, these are not the areas of my life that  The Lair  will explore, largely because I think it takes away meaning from our friendships by discussing such things in an open-forum.  I believe, however, that I am a person that is fairly open about a great many things, and I hope many of my philosophical musings, spurious random thoughts, and ill-fated attempts at humor will plaster the walls of §iendel’s Lair for years to come.  Now I hereby finish my “ urlLink Christening ” of  The Lair  by breaking an imaginary wine bottle (filled with the most expensive imaginary wine) over the entrance causway.  Here’s to hoping that my next post will be less-somber than the first...

      Here ya go Brandon, here's a post about possibly the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet.  According to  urlLink this  article and  urlLink this  one, up to 1 million people are facing starvation and possible genocide due to an arab militant uprising. The real kicker is that the Sudanese government denies there is any problem, and that they are not supporting the militants that are terrorizing their own people - even though there is a plethra of evidence to the contrary (including NASA photos showing widespread destruction of hundreds of villages).  One of the (very) few foreign policy pluses I'm going to credit the Bush administration with, is that Powell is going over there to bring world-wide attention to this problem.  I also like to point out to any pro-French supporters out there (not that I think any of us are) that of the UN's request for $350 million in aid, the US and Britain have given over a third (over 130 million) [and this prior to any focused media attention], while the good 'ole French have given a whopping $3 million.

      Well, looks like if you ever wanted to see a koala bear in its natural habitat, time is running out.  It appears likely that they only have about 15 years left before they bite the big one (refer to this  urlLink article ).  And I thought urban sprawl here was bad.  While driving around at night, the most likely animal around Seattle to get hit is the relatively ugly (and quite abundant) possum, and cats and dogs are really the only animals that most people would feel sad about hitting.  I can't imagine how people in Australia feel about running over koala bears.  I can't really see a reason why one should feel any difference between possums and koala's... but most of us do.  It's just something about their cute and fuzzy appearance that tugs at the heart strings.  Well, it looks like that particular evolutionary protection mechanism doesn't seem to work on cars and houses (or even dogs).  Even the cute and fuzzy creatures of the world lack immunity to the great plaque that is man.

      NEWS FLASH -  OUTSOURCING JOBS REACHES NEW HEIGHTS  by Staff Reporter Melynda Jill  Washington D.C. - Congress today announced that the Office of President of the United States will be outsourced to overseas as of June 30th, the end of this fiscal year. The move is being made to save $400K a year in salary, a record $521 Billion in deficit expenditures and related overhead. "The cost savings will be quite significant" says Congressman Adam Smith (D - Wash) who, with the aid of the Congress's research arm, the General Accounting Office has studied outsourcing of American jobs extensively. "We simply can no longer afford this level of outlay and remain competitive in the world stage," Congressman Smith said. Exporting American jobs has been a popular trend lately, ironically at the urging of President Bush.  Mr. Bush was informed by email this morning of the termination of his position. He will receive health coverage, expenses and salary until his final day of employment. After that, with a two week waiting period, he will then be eligible for $240 dollars a week from unemployment insurance for 13 weeks. Unfortunately he will not be able to receive state Medicaid health insurance coverage as his unemployment benefits are over the required limit.  "I'm in shock," Mr. Bush stated. "I thought fer sure I'd have some job security around this here place. I have no idea what I'll do now," he further lamented.  Preparations have been underway for some time for the job move. Sanji Gurvinder Singh of Indus Teleservices, Mumbai, India, will be assuming the Office of President of the United States as of July 1. Mr. Singh was born in the United States while his parents were here  on student visas, thus making him eligible for the position. He will receive a salary of $320 USD a month but with no health coverage or other benefits. Due to the time difference between the US and India, Mr. Singh will be working primarily at night, when offices of the US Government will be open.  "I am excited to serve in this position," Mr. Singh stated in an exclusive interview. "Working nights will let me keep my day job at the American Express call center. I always knew I could be President someday."  Congress stressed patience when calling Mr. Singh as he may not be fully aware of all the issues involved with his new position. A Congressional Spokesperson noted that Mr. Singh has been given a script tree to follow which will allow him to respond to most topics of concern. The Spokesperson further noted that "additional savings will be realized as these scripting tools have already been used previously by Mr. Bush here in the US. Such scripts will enable Mr. Singh to provide! an answer without having to fully understand the issue itself."  Congress continues to explore other outsourcing possibilities including that of Vice-president and most Cabinet positions.

      I'm not sure how many of you played Civilization: A Call to Power, but it looks like one of the advanced technologies described in the game may becoming a reality.  For those unfamiliar with the civilization series, the general gameplay is as follows:  (1) With pre-stone-age technology you start building cities (2) Your cities grow, you explore and build more cities; occasionally trading/fighting/making peace with other civilizations (3) As you progress you learn new technology  Well, one of the most advanced technologies you can learn in Call to Power is the  urlLink space elevator , which, once it is built allows you to build cities in space (and launch other space vehicles).   Yes, I know the idea wasn't originally found in the game, but since that is where I first heard of it, the game is what gets credit in my blog .  Well, it looks like this idea is no longer on the fringe of scientific research... Congress is actually starting to fund it.  Its kind of exciting; if it works, it would save a lot of money on space launches and would make access to space far more affordable than it is now... possibly providing the means for starting the colonization of space.  Part of me as always wanted to be a space colonist - being the first to explore a whole new world and being able to create a society from the start.  Too bad it's going to take at least 15 years of dedicated effort to build one; it looks like I'll probably have to wait until another life for this particular dream to come true.

      Could this  urlLink boy  be the pebble that starts the avalanche of self-evolution through genetic engineering?  The last paragraph of the above article mentions adapting this recent knowledge to increasing the production of meat per animal... for some reason this seems more disturbing to me.  The full extent of the moral and ethical questions raised by this issue are beyond me, but I sure as hell hope someone is looking into answering them.

      Here's a recent  urlLink article  discussing some issues related to low-carb diets.  Here's a few tidbits from it:  - Supposedly, dieters are to be eating 5 servings of fruits and vegetables while on the Atkins diet [according to the Atkins company medical director], even though these are mostly carbs.  Somehow, I don't think many people on Atkins follow this guideline (or even know about it).  - It appears companies are ripping people on these diets off, by charging more for 'low-carb' products.  Since these claims arn't regulated by the FDA, though, they don't even have to be true.  - People on low-fat diets lose more weight after a year than those on low-carb diets, and low-fat diets have been shown to have a great many beneficial health effects and no known bad ones (as opposed to low-carb diets that are known to lead to increased risks for several serious heath problems).

      Today I began (in earnest) the exciting and scary search for a new home.  The first place I went to was pretty nice, but a bit farther than I'd like.  It was also at the higher end of my personally-set price range (the lenders would probably lend me more, but then they'd own my ass).  It also had the downside of having 3 offers that were being submitted as I was viewing the house - so unless I was ready for a bidding war, only 30 minutes after starting, then I was out of luck.  The second place was a bit more to my liking, and at 10k cheaper than the first house, a bit more to my wallets liking too.  This place is on a corner, with a bit bigger yard (front and back) than the first house.  But over half of it is in the front, and since it is all grass I can already forsee many an afternoon spent mowing.  Since I was actually giving this place a chance, I inspected it more closely and here's what I saw...  Upsides: Not too far away, in a nice neighborhood right off 148th and 116th (I used to drive past the spot on my way to Green River many years ago) Niceties: two marble fireplaces, marble kitchen top, skylight, and comes with all appliances Room sizes were quite adequate (there was no formal dining room, but I'd have no idea what do with it even if it had one), and the kitchen has plenty of cupboards and a window over the sink   Main downsides that I noticed: - master bath is smaller than second bathroom (and has pink-tiled shower and sink) - doesn't appear house is wired for cable - the owners appear to have flunked out of Tim Allen's do-it-yourself school of home projects: (1) even though there was no cable, they put an antenna on the roof, and wired the tv's to it.  It looks like they just punched holes in the wall and threaded the wire through (note the operative word punch - they didn't drill, it looks like the simply took something heavy and pounded out a hole).  They also didn't appear to follow any cabling standards as the holes are too close to the floor, and they didn't even bother connecting the wires to a wall-mounted connector - the wires are just dangling out of oversized holes in the wall. (2) The driveway has/had a thick crack running across it and it appears they tried to fill it with silly putty... I'm not kidding, it really does look like they just tried patching it with whatever they had lying around. (3) They did every room of the house with a different carpet (color and style) and none of them match the rooms they are in.  Its too bad this is the first place I've taken a real good look at.  None of the downsides (even though they may sound bad) are beyond repair - some of them the owners may even be required to fix (or pay to fix) before they can sell it; and it is a nice place.  At least no one has placed an offer on this house yet.  I'm hoping that a couple of other houses come on the market in the next couple of days so I have something to compare it against.  For those interested, I took several pictures with my new camera (graduation gift from my Dad/Step-mom).  Oh well, time to get some much needed sleep.  PS: I also got to see a really cool albino kitty, with two different colored eyes; one blue and the other gold.

      For those interested in such things, check out two supreme court cases that were decided today:  In this  urlLink one , the court unanimously ruled in favor of HMOs (personally, I'm undecided on this one - on principle, I don't like any decision that HMOs like; but, it was a unanimous ruling...).  This  urlLink one  was a 5-4 split decision, ruling against personal privacy rights.  You can now be arrested and/or fined for not giving a cop your name, regardless of whether or not you are actually under suspicion for a crime.

      Well its Monday, and so begins another week - and along with it, the slight bit of hope that something exciting will happen, and the realization that there are still 5 days to go before the weekend.  For the first time in awhile, my life kinda feels like a Monday.  I only have the vaguest impressions of my future - and nothing but the very short-term can be thought of with any certainty.  Like everyone else, I have hopes, dreams, and aspirations, but there is no clear path to obtaining any of them.  Mostly, I think that this is because what I now see as most important, those leading to happiness, are not those that I can achieve alone.  Oh well, I suppose that's life...

      I really could have used this  urlLink pillow  last night... it's a pillow that stays cool all night long.  I'll have to go shopping and see if I can find it somewhere (article said Walgreen's should carry it).  I don't know how many of you have this problem, but in the summer my pillow gets too darn hot to sleep on.  I have to keep turning over, and even that doesn't really help much.

      Figured some of you would like this one (what's really funny, is that I read this in the Buisiness section of the paper):  Dilbert: Now that our profits are improving, can I have a raise?  Boss(a.k.a Sazared): If I start giving people raises, then profits will plummet and we'll be nowhere.  Dilbert: Does your bonus depend on how effectively you oppress me?  Sazared: If you don't like it, try communism.

      Thanks Brandon, for the  urlLink inspiration  for this blog.  You can vote for your favorite super-power via the daily poll (if it's on the list), but here's my thoughts regarding each, and my reasons for choosing the one I voted for - the ability to Gate.  Super-strength: using this power, by definition, requires doing work; and, I think it's a pretty boring choice.  Invisibility: useful for stealing things and sneaking into girls' locker rooms, but has been so played out in movies (mostly bad movies) that I really don't have much interest in it.  It also has the drawback that it can easily be countered (e.g. sprinklers).  Pause/unpause time: this is a pretty cool power, and was the base for a 80's sitcom series.  This power also pretty much makes pointless the option of invsibility, since anything you could do by being invisible can be done a whole lot easier while everyone else is frozen.  Additionally, it would allow for you to play some really funny practical jokes.  The main downside to this power is that you still age while time is paused for everyone else.    Fly: flying is one of those powers I think would be fun for awhile, but would get kinda boring after awhile.  You couldn't fly very far up because you'd freeze to death, and it would suck when its raining.  For getting to places Gating would be much faster, so pretty much flying would be reserved for relaxation (on sunny days).  Gate: my personal favorite.  For those unfamiliar with this term, gating involves opening up a doorway between two points in space which you and other people walk through.  This power of instant travel, compared with the other super-powers, allows you to live more of your life where you want to be - the in-between time normally reserved for traveling is removed.  This power also allows you to visit places you wouldn't normally be able to see: top of Mt. Everest without having to climb (or fly), journey to the space station or even to other planets (as long as you are properly attired before gating).  And the best part of this power, is that you can take other people with you to enjoy these experiences (or choose not to if you just want some 'alone time').  X-ray vision: umm... not exactly sure why I have this on the list, since I don't really consider it much of a benefit.  So what if you can see through woman's clothes - you can see more while invisible (and do more if your evil and choose the pause/unpause time option).  Single element control: if your goal is complete domination over others, this is probably your best bet.  Simply choose Wind as your element, and you effectively can control the weather around the planet.  This gives you control of the food supply, and by extension, all life on the planet.  Additionally, you can use your elemental power to protect yourself from the 5+ billion people who would be trying to kill you.  Talk to fish/other sea creatures: well, dolphins are supposedly the second most intelligent creatures on the planet (next to mice).  Of course, if the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" turns out to be out of date regarding this, then this power is of limited utility.

      Well, I'm at the point where I think I will be taking a brief break from blogging (at least writing my own).    I'm not exactly sure anymore what it is I want this blog to represent.  It has become more difficult than it should for me to come up with ideas to write about.  While I ponder the continuation of this blog, I would welcome and will try my best to fill any requests you may have for blog topics.  Perhaps one of these will inspire me onto a whole new thread of blog writing?  I will of course, post when I feel like it, and I will try and keep the nearly-daily poll question updated.

      I figured this thread started from one of Brandon's posts required a bit more discussion.  My particular take on this issue is that the purpose to our lives is something each of us must decide for ourselves.  This is an obviously a non-unique view - hell, even Curly (City Slickers) says as much, but I think there is merit to the "no one answer fits all" in this case.  I agree with Jennae that the instinctive answer to this question is to have children, that the continuation of your family line gives meaning to your life because part of you will go on to influence the world.  Others may choose to define meaning through their deeds in life.  Some do this by trying to change the world for the better; others by discussing their thoughts via books, movies, internet, or other media, trying to influence as many people as possible and thereby increase the chances for their immortality.  Now a look at a larger picture...  A universe without life has no meaning.  It is simply a collection of inanimate objects following well-defined, prescribed laws of physics.  There is no creativity, no searches for meaning, nothing that gives it a purpose for existing at all.  Now, at some point in the very, very distant future (current scientific thinking), our universe will reach a point where life can no longer exist in it.  If life does ceases to exist at that moment in time, then there really is no meaning to life, no purpose in the universe being created. There would be no difference in the end outcome of existence whether life (in particular ours) had ever existed or not.  Essentially, we'd all have been characters in a great play that no one would ever see.  So, in order to ensure that there is ultimately meaning to our lives, somehow we must find a way to continue on existing even after the end of the universe.  Since this is not something likely to happen in our own lifetimes, there can be no guarentee of success.  We cannot ever know for certain whether or lives will have meaning or not - we can only have "faith" that as long as life continues there is hope for success.    Now we come full-circle, and see that whether they realize it or not, most people choose the meaning in their life in some way that results in the evolution and continuation of our species, in the hope that somehow, someway, the fact that we existed at all will turn out, eventually, to have mattered.

      Normally, waking up to sunshine on a Sunday morning is a rather pleasurable experience.  Today, however, I was actually kind of angry.  The reason I was angry was that up through yesterday, the forcast for today was for it to be cold and raining all day.  The "meteorologists" even were recommending everyone to just stay inside.  No one who had seen these forcasts would even have dreamed of planning anything outside.  OK, I admit, today is not what I'd call extremely good weather - it is afterall mostly cloudy now.  But, it is still good enough to play airsoft or go hiking or do any number of outdoor activities.  But because the 'Oracles' of our day said "Rain", I find myself with very little interesting to do today.  I slept in, and in two hours I'll head off to my folks place for dinner - not exactly a day worthy of remembrance.  Oh well, enough of this 'much ado about nothing'.  Life is short, perhaps I should simply enjoy this rare, care-free day.

      One of Brandon's recent  urlLink posts  got me to thinking about this little incident that happened to me yesterday.  While getting my haircut, I had the priviledge to listen to the conversations of this family visiting the area from out of town.  Judging from their particular drawl, I'm guessing they were from near Kansas City, but they seemed to be fairly typical of people I've met from anywhere in the southeast.  The only reason I was listening to them at all was that they started discussing movies: Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.  Regarding LOTR, they were trying to figure out why the trilogy ended the way it did, without any apparent way to continue on with another sequel.  Not one of the 8 of them had any inkling that the movies were based on books at all.  As far as I could tell, they had never even heard of the LOTR before the movies came out.    Anyway, their line of thinking led them to compare the series with Harry Potter, which they had seen the night before, and which was more typical of their expectations of movie series in that there was an obvious path for making sequels.  They then proceeded to try and guess the number of sequels that there would be, with 4 being there final answer.  Again, not a one of them seemed to realize that there was already 5 printed books, a total of 7 planned, the fact that the movies are based entirely on this best selling series, or the fact that books even existed.  Now, if this was only one or two people I wouldn't think much of their complete lack of knowledge.  But this their entire extended family - grandparents, parents, and children!  Now for the real kicker, what really pissed me off.  There youngest child (~7) was with them, playing with a balloon.  The kid didn't want to give up his balloon, but because his brothers and sisters didn't have one, they told him he had to (so they wouldn't feel bad).  To solve this little problem, the family tells the kid that a child in heaven wants the balloon, and he should let the balloon go so he/she can have it.  The kid, eventually, relents and then is all happy about giving his balloon to, in his words, a kid angel.  Hmm... maybe I shouldn't be so upset with this family afterall.  I mean, it does appear that they are raising their children with books - well, at least one book anyway.

      This morning's Dilbert seemed kinda pertinent to many of us, so I provide the text version here:  Wally: I got a bad case of ergophobia.  It's an abnormal and persistent fear of work.  Dilbert: Isn't everything about you a little abnormal and persistent?  Wally: Yeah, but I'm still delighted when I discover new words for me.  I checked it out, and there really is such a phobia.  I also found this cool list of  urlLink phobias .

      Well, as I have finished my final early and have nothing else to do, I might as well post :-)  I want to start off by saying that "Marx in Soho" was an amazing play, performed absolutely suberbly by Brian Jones.  Now for my comments on the theory of Socialism:  [1] It's a nice theory.  If I were to choose a political system to live under, Socialism would be among my top (if not my top) choice.  Of course, that would only be the case if I could also choose those who would be with me... I have no problem with helping those in need, but people abusing the system for their own personal gain kinda ruin it for everyone else.  [2] It's not realistic in today's world.  The unfortunate sadness, as brought up in the play itself (with reference to the Paris Commune), is that Socialist societies cannot adequately defend themselves against outside oppressors.  Even if all "free" societies were to adhere to the socialist principles, that would still leave a great part of the world outside of the circle.  Since the governments of these countries have a tendency to be run by monarchs, dictators, and elite clubs of power-hungry and greedy people, that would kinda limit the life of the socialist order.   [3] The irony of the situation is, that in order for socialism to supplant capitalism (as forseen by Marx himself), capitalism kinda has to be in complete control of the entire world.  Unfortuneately, I believe corporations know this, that is why they put their financial support behind governement policies that help keep crazy monarchs, dictators, etc. in power.  [4] I humbly disagree with the assertion that capitalism has survived this long merely because of wars that reinvigorate patriotism in their goverments (anti-socialist kind of patriotism).  I personally think the reason it has endured so long is that it has created the middle-class.  This is the class whereby most people in our culture find themselves in, and unlike the lower class, this class has a tendency not to think of themselves as a slave class - even though they are.  Because of this, they will not 'rebel against the current order' because, in general, they arn't upset enough to do so.  They are content because they think themselves better off than the lower class, and many believe that they really have a shot at reaching the elite few of the upper class.  This myth is greatly propelled by corporations via the media as success stories.  The you-can-do-it-too-as-long-as-you-try-hard-enough kind of stories.  Oh well, enough cynicism for one night.  Time to find somtething else to do before I get tired enough to go to sleep.

      Since I didn't post yesterday, I figured I should add something today.  However, as I'm too busy trying to finish my schoolwork while simultaneously doing my real work, I don't really have the time to write anything meaningful.    Over the weekend I saw a really cool play based on the life of Karl Marx. Tomorrow I'll try and post a commentary with my thoughts on Socialism, but until then, I leave you the reader with some words of wisdom (for those of you seeking it anyway):  "The path to wisdom is lined with questions, not answers."  "To be enlightened is to be un-enlightened."  I do not know if these quotes are exact or not, or who the orginal author is (who knows, I could be the author), but I like them.  And for those of you who disagree with the above and think it utter nonsense, it should be known that a highly reliable source (a fortune cookie) left me the following message "You have an ability to sense and know higher truth".  And we all know, you can't argue with the all-powerful fortune cookie.

      Well, moving day is upon me; and soon my PC will be disconnected from the net.  It won't be reconnected until some time on Tuesday (if the Comcast guy shows up), so I'll only be able to post and respond to comments and harass the other blog owners whilst I'm at work (if my boss isn't around).  I feel like I'm about to go into surgery, and a part of me is going to be taken out.  Oh well, its only for a couple of days.

       urlLink   Well, after reading Brandon's post about running out of topics to blog about, I've found something not on the list:  Dreams that no one but me cares about .&nbsp; However, as this is my blog,&nbsp;it doesn't really matter&nbsp;if any of you objects to dream-posts.   I&nbsp;only occassionaly have&nbsp;dreams anyway, often don't remember them, and when I do, it's even money as to whether I'm even in them (I've had a number of rather "real-like" dreams where it's like I'm watching a movie, and no one I know is playing any of the characters - weird huh?).   Anyway, last night, even though I only had a couple hours of sleep, I did have a rather interesting dream, and many of you were in it.&nbsp; We were working for the U.N. and were in some mid-east country (Saudia Arabia I think) at some&nbsp;time in the future.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure it was the future because some local guy asked me what countries I had been too and I said I had been to all of them.&nbsp; We were wearing special vests indicating we were&nbsp;representing the U.S. [seems kinda stupid we were advertising this - but oh well, its a dream].&nbsp; Anyway, while we were in this really cool&nbsp;compound (kind of like the&nbsp;floating-city from FF&nbsp;VIII), there was a terrorist strike against us.&nbsp; We started running&nbsp;for cover and hid inside a&nbsp;freezer - which must&nbsp;have&nbsp;had mostly lead walls.&nbsp; I say this because right after we shut the&nbsp;door, there was a nuclear&nbsp;blast nearby&nbsp;and we somehow survived it (although I do remember suffering some radiation burns - looked kinda nasty too).&nbsp; Afterwards, we got out and started walking / limping around the compound and saw whole rooms full of dead&nbsp;people and a couple of people who really would have been better&nbsp;off dead.&nbsp; We helped out those that we could - I had a strange sense that the locals were in awe that the Americans somehow&nbsp;managed to survive such a disaster when so many of them obviously didn't.... and then&nbsp;my memory becomes disjointed.&nbsp; I seem to remember something about our only escape from the building was through these water tubes that had log-like boats to travel through them and some of you fell off (or intentionally jumped off) and had to be rescued.   And from there on I can't remember anything... ok, so it wasn't that cool of a dream but it kept me occupied for a few minutes writing about it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Last night I got a demo of the most kick-ass home theater system I've seen.&nbsp; And there was no big-screen tv, no expensive LCD or Plasma screen taking up valuable room space.&nbsp; It used an Infocus projector, displaying 90" widescreen video right on the wall.&nbsp; The image quality at this size was superior to anything else on the market (except for higher-end projectors) and cost only $1000.&nbsp; Now 1k is still a lot of money, but it is a lot cheaper than the 2-3k for a 42" LCD or&nbsp;Plasma display or rear-projection big screen TV.&nbsp;   What really made the demo especially cool was the 9-piece surround sound system (retail $500).&nbsp; With this system, the ground shook when something blew up --> something I'm looking forward to after so many years of having to keep the sound level at a whisper [regardless of whether I end up with a big-TV, the projector, or both, I am getting this sound system].   Now there is a downside... the projection system requires a really dark room to get the desired effect.&nbsp; The owner even said that he doesn't even bother trying to watch movies on it during the day.&nbsp; Since my main family room is too open for me to keep dark, I'll have to see if I can retrofit one of my other rooms.&nbsp; So much for&nbsp;the second bedroom; although who'd object to staying in their own movie theater?

      This is going to be one of those 'dear diary' entries that I don't particularly feel belongs on this blog, but since many of us at some point in our lives will own a house or&nbsp;condo, maybe the following tirade will be useful to you at some point.   Well, I spend most of the day yesterday finishing up the paperwork needed to close on my house.&nbsp; It was so much fun  .&nbsp; First off, I got to spend an hour with my insurance agent.&nbsp; Instead of discussing the&nbsp;coverage on my new house (which apparently I had already handled), we&nbsp;instead discussed the various forms of additional life insurance I should consider.&nbsp; In case you havn't experienced this yet, there is nothing more exciting than discussing life insurance policies  .&nbsp; I wonder if dying&nbsp;of boredom from discussing life insurance is covered in any of those policies.   ... a bit later on.&nbsp; I approached the towering monolith in downtown Renton, known to me as One Renton Place, and knownst to others as 'work'.&nbsp; Happily, the company handling my loans, even though they are headquartered in Chicago,&nbsp;had their Seattle area office in this building, only 5 minutes from my apt.&nbsp; It was here, on the second floor, that I had the esteemed priviledge of sitting in a closed room for two hours with a stack of papers written in legalese that I had to read and sign.&nbsp; Luckily for me, one of my recent classes was instruction on legalese, and so I was able to review the documents before me without the need of hiring a lawyer.&nbsp; For those interested in what such&nbsp;a language comprises, it is mostly a collection of&nbsp;unnecessarily&nbsp;long words that are unprounceable in&nbsp;English, which with&nbsp;rare exception all mean  "my ass is&nbsp;covered, yours is not" .   At the conclusion of this meeting, I gave the representative of this corporation a check representing&nbsp;a large chunck of my&nbsp;early retirement&nbsp;money.&nbsp; In return, I received the pen I had used to sign all of the documents and a bottle of drinking water.&nbsp; This exchange concluded the deal, and my working soul for the next 30 years was now owned by a company that makes money transfering my debt to&nbsp;other companies.&nbsp;   Supposedly, owning a home is supposed to be a good thing, but somehow I feel like I've just chained myself; like I've fallen into a well-laid trap meant to keep me subservant to the whims of the capitalist system.&nbsp; Oh well, at least my house is pretty.&nbsp; Oops, sorry, I meant to say, at least the lending institution's house&nbsp;is pretty.&nbsp;

      I had planned on writing up a full review on "The Corporation", which is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen, but I've decided on taking a different approach this morning.&nbsp; You see, today, our CEO along with representatives from the National Cervical Cancer Coalition was honored with the priviledge of openning the NASDAQ stock market.&nbsp; If you are somewhat curious as what such an event entails, you can visit our web site at  urlLink www.tripathimaging.com .&nbsp; Summarizing it, there are a lot of rich people standing behind a really big screen filled with flashy images and with happy, energetic music filling the air.&nbsp; The extreme irony of writing a positive review about an anti-corporation movie on such an occasion was just&nbsp;too much for me.&nbsp; On a completely selfish level, I can look on this event in a good light because I will be being paid to re-watch it later today while&nbsp;eating&nbsp;a free catered breakfast [apparently the price for my loyalty is pretty cheap].  &nbsp;  Of course, I don't quite work for the typical corporation.&nbsp; Until fairly recently, this company hadn't been very good at being a corporation -&nbsp;it wasn't until this week that our company announced, for the first time in our 15 year existence, that "we" didn't lose money this quarter (according to the press release, we made between $0.00 and $0.01 per share).&nbsp; Looking back at our latest financial reports, I found that in those 15 years&nbsp;we have spent just under a quarter billion dollars of rich peoples' money to fund our efforts to save people's lives, without this company making any money for them in return.&nbsp; I wish someone would give me $250 million dollars and not have to give any of it back ;-)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I can't really say that this company is any more or less moral than any other company, as I agree with the producers of "The Corporation" that companies don't have a&nbsp;moral conscience.&nbsp; But, looking at the huge number of companies that seem to exist only to extract the few remaining pennies from the pockets of the poor, I can only be somewhat greatful that I get paid to develop and improve products that actually end up saving lives.  &nbsp;  But, I'm also not going to delude myself - as the Ms. Jade Fox put it so well, all companies have a downside to them.&nbsp; The primary downside of our company's efforts is that the price of heathcare has gone up.&nbsp; Because our test is better than the previous method of cervical cancer screening, lawyers have been able to convince HMOs and other insurance providers to increase the amount of money they give for the test.&nbsp; Because healthcare costs more, we find that the people most in need of having our test done are those that can't afford it.&nbsp; On balance, our products end up saving many more lives than are lost because of them, but that does bring up an interesting moral question:&nbsp; is it moral to knowingly sacrifice one individual (without their consent) to save the lives of two? three? or even a hundred others?

      Check out this site for a pretty cool game of  urlLink twenty questions .  A guy at my work showed this to me this morning.  You just think of something, the computer then asks you twenty questions about it, and it seems to be pretty good at guessing it.  It correctly guessed a comb, a blackhole, and a pulsar.  The only requirement is that you answer the questions truthfully, which does require some amount of knowledge about the object you choose (in the blackhole example, you'd have to know that blackholes are really, really small).  Have fun!  [Added] It also guessed moss, pumpkin, rainbow, coffee beans, and a robot; but took more than 20 questions to get "computer program".

       urlLink Modafinil   is  a small white pill that revs up the central nervous system without the jitteriness of caffeine or the addiction and euphoria of amphetamines    Here a couple of funny quotes from the article in case you don't have the time or the inclination to read the whole thing...   Without it my life would not be possible    And the drug is not considered addicting?    No one knows exactly how it works, but sales of the drug are skyrocketing   Woohoo, Lets Party!    This drug enables us to be that much more workaholic    Hmm... I don't know about anyone else, but I sure as hell wouldn't be taking this drug so I could work more.  I would be taking it so that I could spend more of my waking life not working.    ...scientists warn that cutting back on sleep, even by one hour a night, can have long-term neurological and cardiovascular effects that are only now being recognized    Damn.  Well, I guess I'll see ya'll in the looney bin.

      While reading the typical blah blah blah about the  urlLink proposed constitutional amendment  on marriage being voted on this week, I came across this little bit of information that almost caused me to choke on my lunch:   "The one Democratic co-sponsor, Sen. Zell Miller of Georgia, has endorsed Bush’s re-election and will speak at the Republican National Convention."  How can the guy seriously consider himself a Democrat?  I can only assume that Rumsfield is testing one of the mind-control experiments the Pentagon is funding.    Another intriguing and totally unlikely possibility is that he's protecting the whale-lovers in his state in exchange for his support; with the military deciding to build their new  urlLink underwater sonar  testing range in the Carolinas instead of Georgia.

      For those bored individuals who wish to keep in contact with me all the time, I've just added yahoo instant messenger to my repertoire: profile ID is sstowe123.  I've had AIM and a couple of different ICQ accounts before, I just didn't use them enough to bother keeping them around.  Lets see how long I'll keep this one for.

      For all of us single-in-Seattle looking for that special someone, according to  urlLink Forbes   the reason is probably because singles here tend to be outdoor types.  Yet another reason to hit the hiking trails and campgrounds this summer ;-)

      ... the Bush Administration is  urlLink distorting science .  I have been reading murmors about this from time to time, and even the main stream media occassionally has thrown out a line or two expressing concern, but I didn't realize Bush's team would be so blatant about it.  I mean, asking a scientist about his political views during a job interview isn't a very subtle way of going about it.  A snipet from the article:    The union, chaired by Dr. Kurt Gottfried, Emeritus Professor of Physics at Cornell University, said more than 4,000 scientists, including 48 Nobel laureates, had joined the call for "restoration of scientific integrity in federal policymaking."    Wow... kinda makes you wonder who are the scientists that are coming up with all the 'evidence' the administration is using?  Many times we hear Bush mention that the science isn't very clear on a particular point (like global warming).  Of course the science isn't going to be clear if you bury all of the evidence.  This type of 'involvement' by the government really pisses me off.  I understand that the root of a lot of contentious issues is usually a fundamental difference in opinion on some point.  But science isn't supposed to have opinions, there is only evidence either in support of a theory or not.  You don't hear scientists saying "In my scientific opinion, the Earth is really cube-shaped.  I havn't conducted in studies on this, I just figure I'm always right."    Well, I'd like to rant more on this, but it'll have to wait - gotta get to work :-(

      I've been trying to keep up with the latest research in hydrogen-fuel cells.  Besides my interest in the obvious benefits (environmental, political, etc), I happen to know someone working in the field.  For those interested,  urlLink here  is an idea that looks pretty cool - I wonder if for once the little guys will win...

      For those in need of little extra cash (and happen to be near eastern Canada) check out this  urlLink opportunity .  It seems kinda odd that this information would be broadcasted, though.  Wouldn't the growers and drug companies expect the amount of stolen crops to increase with the added news coverage?  Then again, its not like this is CNN or the BBC - maybe no one reads this online paper.  On a different topic, for those looking for a feel-good story, check out this  urlLink Chihuahua .

      I think this comment of mine is deserving of its own post:  All life is valuable....  So, does a gnat have the same value as a human? A dog? Even an ugly possum? What about plants? Is the life of a plant equal to that of other life forms? If so, how can we eat... knowing that no matter what we eat, plant or animal, it is like we are consuming part of ourselves?  Bacteria, viruses, and even itty bitty prions... there is open question whether some of these can even be considered living. But if they are, can they also be considered as valuable as we are?  If not all life is considered equal, how do we proportion value amongst such diverse forms of existence?  By default, we are programmed at the genetic level to value like creatures more than those different. It is a form of protectionism, ensuring that in the grand scheme of evolution, it is our gene sequences that will ultimately survive. It is not a matter of being shallow or not, we all have and can choose to draw the dividing line wherever we wish... and, ultimately, we make our choice based on the degree of suffering we wish to endure for the sake of others.  One cannot really mean it to say that all life is equal and still choose to live. Every moment we exist, we are causing the death and suffering of untold millions of living things. Therefore, we remain alive (like it or not) because ultimately we believe ourselves to be above some of these other forms of life.  Some will say that the moral path is to prevent needless suffering and death, to restrict it as much as possible. But what is the definition of needless? As mentioned above, the only way to eliminate the pain you cause is to not be. Obviously, keeping yourself alive is necessary (afterall, your own life is of value)... but living without pain is not necessary (nor even possible). So, does that mean preventing needless pain is to suffer as much as possible while keeping yourself alive - is this what is required to be moral? No, the reality is there is no moral answer here - to live is to be immoral. Accept it, and move on.

      Here's a short review of two movies: XXX (per request) and Spider-Man II   XXX  I'm going to compare this movie, not against good movies, but against the most recent Bond movies - since XXX really is a different spin on them.  First off, I liked XXX (even though I know a lot of other people didn't).  My reasons: - although there were the occasional corny lines, they weren't nearly as frequent, blatant, nor as bad as those uttered by Pierce Brosnan - the movie was fun to watch, it was obvious that the director enjoyed making the movie - the movie never aspired to be anything more than what it was, which was nothing more than an action-film.  No one went into this thinking they were going to see Oscar-winning performances - the secret agent gadgets were realistic.  It seems that in the Bond films, the gadgets are becoming more and more based on what the special-effects guys can do instead of what is possible in the real world. - last but not least, the "Bond-girl" in XXX wasn't a major part of the movie.  She wasn't an expert martial-artist or nuclear scientist, and didn't have near the capabilities of the main star - I think the new Bond-films are trying to be too PC and as a result are ruining the quality of the series.   Spider-Man II  Wohooo!  This was among the best of the comic-book movies.  I don't want to spoil anything in it, so this review is going to be short: - The villain is done extremely well; just the right amount of special effects, a great back-story, and he's not evil just because (in fact, he's not even really evil) - The hero feels conflicted, and because of it the movie benefits tremendously.   - The humor in the movie was done well.  For once, there wasn't one-liner after one-liner - most of the jokes were situational comedy.  I wish more movies took this approach.

      Well, it has been a couple days since I last posted - been busy with house things.  Most notably enjoying the kick-ass home theater system I got this weekend.  Most of you came over to watch it in action, but I wouldn't call 'Bad Santa' a suitable demonstration.  No, to truly appreciate it, you'll have to see the LOTR movies on it.  I just finished watching  The Two Towers .  With the extremely cool landscape footage and epic battle sequences that cause the floor and windows to shake (all in true-widescreen format) there really is no comparison with any other film.  I look forward to having a marathon session with all of you once the extended version of  The Return of the King  is released.

      The Associated Press Updated: 2:29 p.m. ET Aug. 5, 2004  WASHINGTON - President Bush offered up a new entry for his catalog of “Bushisms” on Thursday, declaring that his administration will “never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people.”  Bush misspoke as he delivered a speech at the signing ceremony for a $417 billion defense spending bill.  “Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we,” Bush said. “They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.”  It's not every day the "leader of the free world" makes an ass of himself like this... only every other day.  Of course, this assumes he actually misspoke - when he said it, none of the military people there reacted... [insert X-File theme music here].

      Thanks to those who partook (sp?) in last night's D&D adventure, making my first party so much fun.  I apologize for the mess, but I assure you it was intentional... I wanted the game to seem more real: since our characters were hanging out with Bogart, the living garbage heap, why not spend the time playing in own garbage heap ;-)  Oh well, in time my place should start looking less and less like the set of Outworld (Mortal Kombat) and more like a place we can throw a real party.  Until then though, I can practice my mountain climbing skillz in the privacy of my own home.

      Well, yesterday was a good day as far as reconnecting me back with the rest of the world (or a bad day, depending on your perspective).  The Comcast guy actually showed up early - although he didn't replace my modem (which is starting to have its gray hairs falling out).  So, now I have internet back at home [which is probably where I should be writing these blog posts and not at work, but oh well].  So, sorry Jeff, looks like I'll be keeping Cable and not going to DSL.  A Quest tech also showed up to fix my phone service.  I don't know how they did it, but my phones worked when I got into the house, but stopped working as soon as my Quest service started.  Apparently whichever phone company was previously servicing the house (Verizon I think), they manually disabled the phone lines requiring Quest to send out a tech (that or Quest people are dumb)... I would normally laugh at this but not having my phones work (and still paying for the service) blows.  Oh well, enough of "this is how my day went" post - time to get some sleep - yes, I'm still at work ;-)  PS: I picked up a kick-ass sound system at Fry's yesterday (on sale).  Too bad, Fry's customer service is the worst I've ever seen, else I might have also picked up a projection system.  But, after standing around for 15 minutes and still not talking with anyone who knew anything, all I wanted to do is pile all of the employees into a big mound, stick dynamite up their asses and light the fuse.

      ... is a mess.  Well, we managed to get all of my stuff bundled into a 15' truck and hauled to my new place, where it was prompty piled into a large mound.  A big thanks to T-man and Chris for helping me move all the crap I've collected over these last six years [also thanks to those who helped me move many of my small boxes of crap the night before].  Driving a large truck was new experience for me; it kinda feels like your driving a tank (but without the weaponary).  I learned that I should be a bit more courteous to U-haul truck drivers, since you really can't see anything around you when you're driving one.  When you merge you kinda just hope there isn't someone there (not that they'd pose any real danger, but the truck company charges you a premium to fix dents and to clean up blood stains).  Yesterday, my first full day in my new house, also was enlightening.  I learned where most of the vast wealth of the American people goes.  I think the reason houses have 30-year mortgages is so people don't realize they have this huge debt and are therefore quite willing to spend those years filling up their new status symbol with lots of crap from stores who specialize in this sort of thing.  Home Depot, Target, etc. are mostly filled with items that you would't need if you didn't have a house.  And you don't have much choice in the matter... sure, I could let the plants die and pave the grass so I wouldn't have to mow it [not that I would really do this] --> but then the neighborhood home-owners association would put a lien on my house and kick me out.  So much for the concept of private ownership.
