      I hate clouds on a sunny day. I hate fast cars that are slow. I hate cigarettes in the grass. I hate good food that tastes nasty. I hate dirt on clean surfaces. I hate smiles on sad people. I hate frowns on happy people. I hate tiredness without sleep. I hate friends without relationships. I hate love without expression. I hate the expected unexpected. I hate good music that sucks. I hate real people that are fake. I hate the security of insecurities.

      I have been reading reviews, diatribes, and screeds for and against Michael Moore's Farenheit 9/11. America is messed up. I'm not talking about President Bush or Senator Kerry, I'm talking about the political emotion, logic, scene. Where is our country going to be in eight, twelve, or sixteen years? How easily will the denizens of our country be manipulated and led? What misinformation will it take?   The people are being trained to follow emotions. Their emotions are being conditioned by the media. What are the largest, most visible, most powerful corporations in this world? Might I suggest mass media. Visual media. The Entertainment industry.  Who really controls the people? The IT who controls information, emotion. IT reaches everyone. Billions of people are dependant on 4 or 5 closely associated news sources. Think of the power they control. Whatever they choose to display we soak in. Four to five corporate groups do our thinking for us.  What does that mean to you?  Is there an agenda?  What is it?  Where would you like to see America in 16 years?  How do we get there?  Who can lead us?  Do the people know what is best?  Is there a power struggle between the legislative, executive, and representative bodies?  Who REALLY controls america?  When was the last time you QUESTIONED something?  How do you solve a problem?  How do you find a solution?  Do people choose what they believe?  Is there such a thing as subconcious brainwashing?  Are people really that smart?  Is the totally obscure feasible?  Do you start with a solution?  Or a question, or problem?  Is America headed toward social chaos?  Who would most enjoy that?  Who would most benefit?  What patterns are there in history that might mirror our present predicament?  Is history a window into the future?  If everything is "relative" what is truth?  What is happiness?  Can anyone appease two different opinions?  Must we all take a stand?  Where to stand?  When was the last time you THOUGHT?  Go find things out for yourself. Read history. Study ALL the perspectives. Open your mind. Listen to Limbaugh. Read Moore. Search the internet. GO places. Talk to people. But most important, QUESTION EVERYTHING! (ask good questions) Don't go looking for answers with preconceived solutions. You can always find something to support a view. Search for truth. Read the facts. Read the opinions. Understand where your information is coming from. Understand from what perspective it was written from. Understand the ideas the author takes for granted. Find out. What is the agenda? What does the source VALUE? NEVER trust assumptions. Find out what you value. If you look, you will find.  The apathetic mind is easily controlled and manipulated. Stay smart.
