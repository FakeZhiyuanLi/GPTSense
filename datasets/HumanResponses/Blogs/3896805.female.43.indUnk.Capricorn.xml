      Why isn't Bastille Day a fete here like cinqo de mayo?  Is it because the French wine industry doesn't want to market to ordinary people?

      This movie justifies divorce.  The protaganist is married to a beautiful, good woman who loves him and their child.  Yet he feels justified in leaving his family to persue another woman (who after nine years really is a different person).  His justification is the lack of laughter in his home.  He feels that he has stuck with the relationship out of a sense of commitment.  He acknowledges that he married the woman with misgivings, only because she became pregnant, and that while nothing was wrong with their relationship, there were no fireworks.  Don't you think the fireworks will disappear from the new relationship?  Granted both are artists. She paints, composes and plays music and he is a writer and musician.  So they communicate in the same style.  Couldn't the next film be a concurrent look at the kindergarten teacher's life?  This is a waste of a woman's entire life.  He was extremely irresponsible to continue in the relationship.  She should never have continued her involvement with him.  Now she has a child, who is great, but has no idea that his eggshells are about to be broken.  Why don't marriage vows mean anything.  The eggshells shouldn't be broken.  It's too bad that you settled for the wrong person.  You have to take responsibility for that choice.  The woman of your dreams was not available to you.  You chose to start a family and make a commitment to this woman.  As did she.  Who will keep the memories?  The guy says he doesn't want to wake up when he's 52 and realize that he's wasted his life.  This happens to so many people.  I think they realize that they haven't actually shared their lives with their spouses and therefore there are no mutual memories to preserve or cherish together in old age.  The marriage has no value and therefore is basically annuled as if it had never been.  Since it had never really been.   It is so hard, and distracting and boring and compromising to share yourself with the wrong person.  It is very easy with friends, who hold no power over you.  Maybe power is the problem.  Power leads to fear, which leads to secrecy and hiding.  So there is no sharing or intimacy except for the public moments which are staged and not real or worth preserving or remembering.
