      I can't believe it's almost the 4th of July already.   Here come the tourists, en masse.   The plan? Stay out of DC.   But I hate holidays anyway, including this one. I'd rather just sleep through the whole damn weekend and pretend it doesn't exist.   Does that make me a bad person? Or just sad and pathetic?   I'm not sure.

       urlLink Did They Read It: You Sent It, But Did They Read It?   Someone mentioned this website today. It allows you to know exactly when the email you sent was opened, how long it was read, and where geographically it was read. You'll even be alerted if it's forwarded! And it's totally "invisible" so no one nows you're using it! All for just $49.95 a year!!  Right.  This isn't going to enable stalkers and stalking or anything.

      Confirmed.   Tony Granato is once again an assistant coach for the Avs, after a year and a half in the head coaching position.  urlLink Read here.   I'm a little upset although I think it's more because I really like Tony Granato (and he played hockey for Wisconsin) but Lacroix always seems to know what he's doing. Unilke other franchises I could name (Can anyone say the Capitals?), this is a GM who hasn't made huge fuck-up decisions. Unlike GM GM. Lacroix gets good players and makes smart decisions; GM GM makes his choices on what will bring him  personally  the biggest benefit and the most money. And let's face it: The Avs have never had a season like the last few the Caps have.   Further, Quenneville used to be with the team! And Tony, if the article is anything to go by, doesn't seem that upset about this. I just wonder why it happened at all. Too bad we won't get to see the actual results of the change until way in the future. Like the next time there actually is an NHL season. Whenver that is.

      The 4th was a bust. I did nothing. And I have all this guilt for eating only junk food all weekend. But, I suppose it's better than the alternative. Doing nothing and NOT eating junk food all weekend. I mean, it wouldn't have been nearly as not-fun as it was without the junk food.  Meanwhile, I've come to the conclusion that Tuesday-Mondays are worse than Monday-Mondays. Sure, we get all excited with the "Oooh! 3 day weekend!" thing but I find that when Monday is on a Tuesday it's a lot more difficult to get through not to mention the fact that WHOA! In one day it's the middle-of-the-week-hump-day Wednesday already and you've got to figure out PRONTO what you are doing for the weekend, not to mention wrap up stuff for the end of the week so you're not overwhelmed the next Monday but you only have 3 days to do it after your Tuesday-Monday!   Yet this conclusion does not bode well for me. In my soon to start compressed work schedule where I work, in a 2 week period, 8 nine hour days, 1 eight hour day and have a day off every other week....I chose Monday as my off-day. I wanted Friday. I have no senority. Hence, every week, I get a Tuesday-Monday. Hopefully they will go faster than THIS one.  To kill time and keep me awake I went to  urlLink McSweeny's . I haven't been there in awhile; I kept meaning to go last week but it slipped my mind. Anyway, it was the perfect boost to a Tuesday-Monday afternoon slump. Mad props to anyone and everyone who writes that stuff. Today's favorite? On the  urlLink LIST  of   urlLink Playlists in Dick Cheney's IPOD ..."Ascroft, Seals and Croft." Kudos.   Also? The Brother's Chaps are not so quality these days. Regardless of the fact my emails to StrongBad have been ignored, they just aren't bringing the funny anymore. Don't get me wrong; ANYTHING they do is amusing. It just isn't Ab-Abber Trogdor standard lately. But always funny...the #1 Summer Jam Powered by the Cheat,  urlLink Everybody To The Limit .

      It occurs to me it's been some time since I "blogged." What can I say...I've been busy. Work, roommate finding, moving. The list goes on. I won't bore anyone with the details; I'll just start with today.  Love of the day: The new Carbon Leaf cd. So good!  Hate of the day: Being at work and not sleeping in my bed.  Funny of the day:  urlLink McSweeneys Internet Tendency . Always McSweenys. This time? The Lists and Diary of a Congressional Candidate.  Grr of the day: The Red Line metro. FIX IT!  Debate of the day: Mary Kay Leatourneau's prison release and if she should/will get back together with her 6th-grader-now-21-year-old lover. I say go for it. You both adults, you say you're still in love, and I can't imagine anyone else who wants either of you anyway.  Question of the day: What was the order of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series books? We wondered. I searched. The answer is located  urlLink here .  Dumb of the day: Trying to drive your car while in neutral. It ranks up there with Tuesdays 'reply to all' fiasco when I emailed everyone in the office to the secretary about what kind of calender I want for 2005. Let's just say everyone was happy to know I wanted the motivational one for my desk.  Smart of the day: I saved money! I remembered to pack a lunch!  Reminder of the day: Pay the car insurance bill!  Joke of the day: Democrats are sexier. I mean, who ever heard of a 'nice piece of elephant'?  Word of the day: dollop  Number of the day: 56  Random saying of the day: "One, two, five like a Christmas tree." I have no idea what it means but I think it's hysterical.  Time waster of the day: This list.  And for the record, I never said I HATED Lance Armstrong.
