      'Tao Hua Ngu' in thai literally translates to 'Old Snake Head'. A popular term referring to 'Dirty Old Man' in English. By 'Dirty' - I'm really referring to the pervert mind that they possess.

My mom made a long distant phone call to my dad who is currently at our home in Thailand. He sounded distant and somewhat frustrated. A little expert probing from my mom revealed that he had been avoiding phonecalls from my uncle and his business partner. The usual disagreement regarding the running of the business but what's interesting is my mom's gut feeling about this new business venture

It seems to her that it is a facade.... and a very convenient one too. Frequent long trips to thailand were made by my uncle and his business partner. Mom tells me that their trips usually involved extended stays in hotels and meeting people.... ladies.

It got me thinking.

Why did they even go to thailand during the water festival (Thai new year) to do business when everybody's probably closing shop and having fun? Besides, it's not like they're making big bucks from this trading company either, afterall, it is a new start up. Shouldn't cost be a factor? Seems not, judging from their 10 day stay in hotel in thailand.

My uncle's wife is the sweetest lady, a peace maker in the family and a great wife, mother and grandmother all rolled into one. What makes a man stray?

Of cos, I'm hardly in the position to judge their actions but their sneaky trips to Thailand on the pretext of doing business is hardly a gentlemanly thing to do.

I've seen couples who love each other to death - you know, stories that you read in the papers about how the wife or the husband just dies days after their partner passed on.... probably out of sorrow and heart break. I know it's hard to find but it's cases like this that makes me believe in true love.

I just wonder how many of us are lucky to find that.

      Until today, I've always wondered to myself how a man can actually do the ungentlemanly act of cheating a gal of her money. Yup, that gal was me.

I'm no longer bitter or going crazy over it - let's say, I've finally learnt to let go and accept it but believe me, before I got to be this 'forgiving' - I nearly went mad with a lot of heartache, tears and depression. That was last year.

See, this guy was an ex-boyfriend and although we had broken up couple of years before - we remained friends.... as I always do with my other Exes. To cut the long story short, he needed the money to pay for supplies and wages for his 'so called business' of his. He was constantly short of cash and many a times, probably didn't have enough to have a decent meal.

I hate to see people suffer and can't help but feel sorry and pity for the guy so as you guessed it, I started to loan him the money but hey, that was because I believed him when he told me that once he starts getting paid for his business, I'll get my money back. The last thing I expected was for him to weave a web of lies... 1 whole year of it to drain my hard earned savings.

Was it intentional? or was it a business deal really gone bad? He even asked me for cash to pay for his wife's delivery.... now, I sometimes wonder if there was a 'wife' in the first place....

On hind sight and after many in depth reflection of my last year's ordeal, I realised that perhaps he's really out to con me... Having known him for so long, the last thing I expected was for him to cheat me of my hard earned money. I mean he borrowed money from me even when we were together but I did it out of pity. But apparently, he being the sucker really sucked all my money from me.

So foolish and gullible of me huh.

I do not weep and dwell on it anymore. Afterall, what do I gain from letting him destroy my life? I may have lost my savings but I have 2 hands, a good education and a job that I love. It was a setback but money lost can be earned back. Life goes on.

I know loansharks are after him and he's probably in hiding somewhere in Malaysia but I figured he can only run so far.. I believe in retribution and what does he gain from doing all these misdeeds? I know one thing for sure..... he will never have a peace of mind and the constant fear of being caught and beaten up by some gangsters.

That, my dear readers is what I call retribution.

I live a happy life now despite all the heavy debts that I'm in.... the most important thing is that I'm managing, I have a job and enjoy good health.

Things could have been worse so I'm basically thankful that the conman is out of my life for good.

      Truely, Madly Me - this marks my debut into the world of bloggers.

Recently introduced to this new experience (by accident really), it has opened a whole new avenue for me to express myself. What you will be reading here? Anything and everything that goes on in my life - that is if you care to read it :).

Life is full of ups and downs, so many lessons to be learnt but at the end of the day, life goes on.
