      When I was in grade five, the school put on the Cinderella play.  My best friend and I were both up for the part of Cinderella.  I wanted it bad, but in the end, the part went to Christie.  I was told that the only reason was that prince charming was short and that I was too tall for him.  In retrospect, I'm sure that my height was probably not what kept me from getting the lead role, but that was the first time in my life that I remember being discriminated against.  Little girls really do believe the Cinderella story.  It's just setting us up for disappointment later in life.  Really, there aren't many cases where the handsome, rich man goes slumming and falls in love with the poor little oppressed, hard working girl.  I know that Cinderella had a good attitude, but didn't the prince really just choose her on her outward appearance?  If he had seen her at the market in the middle of town in her rags, would he have given her a second look?  I doubt it.  But this isn't even the part of the story that bugs me the most.  It's the evil step-mother.  When you hear the words step-mother, don't you always think that the word evil belongs in front of it?  As a step-mother myself, I am again feeling like I'm being discriminated against.  The "she-ex" was here the other day telling my husband; "I don't care what Janet says, Emily comes first!".  What does she think that I'm saying to him?  Does she really think that when Emily comes over that I make her scrub the kitchen floor while the rest of us play and have fun and eat ice cream together?  Does she think that I am telling him that his daughter doesn't matter as much as my children and I do?  Does she really think that he's so brainless that he would go along with my evil plans?  She should be thankful that I treat her daughter with respect and love her as my own - but whatever - I guess I'll always be the evil step-mother to her.  I am flattered however that she thinks that I have that much power over my family.  If only that were true.....  (insert evil laugh here)

      Mystery shoppers are used by retailers, restaurants and banks to evaluate services at the customer level.  Management can get an accurate look at what they are doing right and what they can improve on.  I think that Churches should employ mystery shoppers.  Most churches have a goal to teach and nurture the people in their congregation and in their community.  How do they know if they are accomplishing these goals?  A sample audit sheet might look something like this....  Was there sufficient parking? Were entrances and exits clearly marked? Were you greeted in a friendly manner within two minutes of entering the building? Were the children's services thoroughly explained to you? Did an usher escort you to a seat? Describe the praise and worship time. Did you participate? At any time during the service, was the congregation asked to open their Bibles? Did you feel that the teaching was relevant to your life today? Were the church staff approachable and offering to answer any questions or prayer concerns? Were you thanked for coming and invited to return? If you were to tithe, do you feel that the church would use that money responsibly? Based on your experience today, would you return to this church and would you recommend this church to others?  I think this kind of thing could be helpful.  Who knows how many people are lost each week because the church didn't meet the needs of its people.  Businesses do it all the time.  Why not pay an auditor thirty bucks for a visit?  That's not much for a reality check.  It might be money well spent.

      There is only one thing on my mind this morning and I hesitate to share it because it's kind of gossipy.  I learned something last night and I'm not sure how I should feel about it.  I don't think that there's really anything that I can do about it anyway, but I just wonder how it's going to affect my life - if at all.  My step-daughter announced that she's going to have some people move in with her.  It's a lesbian couple and their two daughters.  The women will be sharing the room next to hers and the girls will be sleeping downstairs.  This is a non- issue for my six year old daughter.  She has no idea what will be going on in the bedroom next door - nor should she.  I am just dreading the conversation about her friends having two mommies or that girls can marry girls.    As I write this, my daughters are playing Barbies behind me.  Their Barbies are mommies with two or three kids each.  One asked the other if she had a husband.  The answer was "no, I don't want a husband."  "Neither do I" says the other one.  I looked behind me to see three naked Ken dolls on a bed together.  I asked who they were and was told that they were uncles.    Things were so much simpler when I was growing up.  When I played Barbies it was either a mom, a dad and some kids or a couple of teen age girls driving around in their cars and meeting friends at the mall.  It's amazing how quickly things can change.    I don't know how I'm going to deal with this new situation.  I'm still trying to figure out my feelings on the subject.  What I do know, is that I would never want to live in a house with three dogs, three girls and three women (no matter how butch they are).  I hope they've budgeted for Midol.   Yuk.

      I don't think that spousal support should exist.  Child support - yes - definitely!  But spousal - NO.  When my husband of eleven years and I divorced, I didn't even think of asking for spousal.  It takes two to make a marriage and it takes two to make a mess of it.  I couldn't kick him out of my life and then also ask him to pay me on top of it all.  That's what divorce is - isn't it?  Separating your two lives...You both have to move on.  Having to pay every month for a woman you no longer have a relationship with doesn't allow for closure.  I also wanted my independence.  I needed to grow up and make it on my own without his financial help.  I'm an adult.  He doesn't owe me a thing.    My new husband however pays $400.00 a month in spousal support.  The length of his relationship with his ex was four years and they were commonlaw - not legally married.  I'm sorry if this offends any of you, but to me there is a big difference.  Anyway, he has to pay her this amount for four years.  My question is...what did she do to deserve this money?  Why is she entitled to control his pocketbook after their seperation?  Why do I have to go to work daily so that she can live comfortably?    We recently figured out that he'd been overpaying her.  We worked it all out and decided that next year he only needs to give her between 35 (my figure) and 75(his figure) dollars a month.  So he takes her all the paperwork yesterday and lets her know that in January her cheques will be for one hundred dollars each month.  Why did he feel the need to round up?  Maybe it's good for his ego to be able to say that he takes care of two families.  I dunno.   If he was paying her to stay out of our lives forever, it might be worth it, but she's still there..everyday...taunting me.   The resentment is building and I fear that one day I'm going to lose it.    Last night when I tucked my daughter into bed she said to me; "Mommy, I just love your face!"  and at that moment I didn't have a care in the world.  All of life's stresses just melted away.  I love your face too Kianna.

      Well, I've already got writers block. The weekend was a drag and Monday sucked in a big way. I don't even have time to tell you all the reasons why it sucked, but it started with spilled milk - which reminds me...I've got to go and get groceries tonight. Hope I make enough money today.   As a waitress (server if you want to be politically correct) I am amazed at how cheap people can be. Yesterday a group of women sat on the patio for drinks. The one ordered a small Pepsi. She wanted a can and was disappointed that we only had fountain pop. (Hello...We're not the 7 eleven) Anyway, I brought her Pepsi over, and she says "this is small????" I explain to her that we only have one size, and that it's refillable, and that she doesn't have to drink it all if she doesn't want to. So she asks me how much it is and I tell her that it's about a buck - eighty. She says to me....Now get this....."I have to go to my car to get more money!"   Ya know what....If you don't have two bucks for a Pepsi, don't come and sit in my section. I don't need to clean up after you for nothing. And one more thing....Don't pay me in pennies! The tooth fairy puts a shiny toonie under the pillow - not a ziplock full of freakin' dirty pennies!

      Men say the stupidest things.  Hubby says to me that if I divorced him, he'd have no reason to live.  I asked why...giving him an opportunity to tell me how wonderful I am.  He answers "because you'd take half of everything!"  I think flowers are in order.

      I am weak.  If it's not his ex, it's mine.  I had promised my hubby that we would keep the kids this weekend even though they are supposed to be at their dad's (girlfriends) house.  You see, the problem is that every time that the kids come home from their visit with their dad, they are filthy dirty and sick.  I  had to take Monday off work this week because they couldn't go to school, and paid 28 bucks for medicine for them.  Also, dad doesn't have a car, so we have to drive the kids back and forth which costs us at least $40 a month.  I get nothing from him - no child support, no spousal, nothing.  I said that this time I'd be strong and just say NO.  He called me last night COLLECT!  Stupid me, I accepted (broke another promise to my hard working husband) just to tell him that I wasn't dropping off the kids this weekend and why. I had expected him to swear and yell and tantrum and had planed on just hanging up when this happened, but..he surprised me.  He talked so nice and respectful.  He told me about his plans to get his life together and I just couldn't say no.  SO...When hubby got home, I had to tell him that we had just paid for another collect call from daddy dearest and that I was going to drive them up to see him after work today.    Now I've upset the man I've got to please the man that I got rid of.  What a horrible person I am.  There didn't seem to be any right answer.  Either way someone was going to be unhappy and I am stuck in the middle.  Thank God my husband forgives me for my weaknesses.  I wonder if I should contact Dr. Phil?

      A good friend of mine blogs every day.  She does it mainly to practice her writing but occasionally does it to bitch about her husbands ex-wife.  Well, I am going to post my first blog for the later reason.     When I could not get in to see the doctor today, I went down the hall to the walk in clinic.  I gave my name, health card number and was told to sit and wait.  After about ten minutes, the ex walks in, gives her name and leaves.  I am relieved because I don't want to face her especially at the walk in clinic.  It's always better to sit there with strangers.  Well, she came back with a friend of hers and sat down a few chairs away.  I thought that I'd make a bad situation more comfortable and tried to catch her eye to smile and say hi.  She totally pretended that I wasn't there.  She would not look at me for the entire 85 minutes that I sat there with her.    Yesterday when she picked her daughter up from my house she looked me in the eye and politely asked for a pair of socks that her daugher had left here, but when we run in to each other at the school or other places in this city, she pretends that I don't exist.  Oooooh - like she's really hurting my feelings.  I don't want to be her friend, but we are going to be in each others lives for a very long time so wouldn't acknowledging my presence be the adult thing to do?   I just can't get over how rude she is.  On the up side, the symptoms that I was experiencing were just due to alergies.  I wonder what deadly disease she was there to see a doctor about?  I hope it's not serious ;-)

      Today was a strange day - Not bad, just strange.  It was the best Halloween that I can remember as far as temperature goes, and yet, all the trick or treaters in my neighborhood were done at 7:30.  Add to the weirdness the fact that it's a Friday night and there's no school tomorrow.  I don't get it.  It wasn't a full moon tonight.  Other things that I witnessed today that don't compute.....  My manager at work who has never said more than a few words to me and rarely smiles, put on a costume today and is suddenly my best buddy.  Maybe I intimidate HIM??? Could it be?  On the highway, while traveling at a speed of 120 km, a truck rides my ass for a good five minutes and then proceeds to flash his lights at me.  When I move out of his way, he doesn't bother passing.  In Hamilton, I pull up to a stop light just in time to see the driver of the car beside me pick his nose and eat the booger.    To accommodate the trick or treaters tonight, my hubby decided to keep the driveway clear.  He parked the van way the &#@! down the road!  Why?  I dunno  When going through my kids candy tonight, I found that someone gave them a package of nuts that comes with a Wendy's salad.    And finally, while driving home tonight (about twenty minutes ago), I drove by a house with all the lights on and the curtains open and saw a naked fat man standing in front of the window chugging a beer.  Gross  I guess I was wrong about the full moon.

      Halloween is in two days and it's been keeping us busy since the weekend.  Shopping for costumes is always a last minute deal.  I'm not big on Halloween.  Maybe it's my religious upbringing, maybe I'm just too much of a girlie girl - never liked scary or gory movies.  For the last few years, my daughter has been a princess and my son a cowboy.  Both are fairly easy costumes to put together.  This year it's a witch and a ninja - also very easy.  Again, the witch thing makes me uncomfortable because of my church background, but I'm not going to sweat over it.  She's seen plenty of Disney movies with witches in them.  To her it's just a character.   Hubby and the kids decorated for the blessed event tonight.  They carved a giant pumpkin and put up the lights, cobwebs and skeleton.  (Or are they spider webs?  I guess I can't blame the cobwebs on them)  I got a headache just in time not to have to participate in the activities.    I wish that I was one of those super-mom's who sew elaborate costumes for the kids every year and bake yummy halloween treats for everyone at school.  I wish I was the cool mom who was organized enough to throw a party for every holiday.  I am not that mom though, and I don't know why.  It's not that I don't have the time.   Sorry kids

      Well, I just returned home from work.  I had five tables altogether and brought home $28 in tips which isn't too bad if you do the math.  (One table didn't tip - the dreaded coffee ladies that I've blogged about before)    I think that the couple at table three were having an affair.  She came in first, nervously looking around, saying that she was meeting "someone".  He came in a few minutes later and they asked for an "out of the way" table.  She ordered a glass of wine, he ordered a premium draught.  Neither had been to the restaurant before, but the thing that gave them away was that both of them were "on".  Ya know - big smiles, loud laughs, good posture,...fake, fake, fake.  Yes, I overheard some of their conversation which contained lots of innuendo.  They obviously hadn't seen each other in a few days and weren't in a hurry to get back to work although they were both dressed professionally.  Of course, they paid in cash.  Although they both appeared to be Sooooo happy, I saw a sadness in her eyes and I felt bad for them.  They just seemed so lost, like each was hoping that the other would be the one to change their lives for the better.  I wonder what the future will hold for them.  I've got a bad feeling about it - but who am I?   I'm just the waitress in an out of the way sports bar where nobody in their circles would hang.  I think they'll be back.  I'll keep you posted.

       (Read my earlier blog today first)   Just as I suspected!   As I'm getting out of the bath, I hear the doorbell ring.  It was a gruesome Halloween scene.  I had used a new razor and knicked my ankle.  Blood was everywhere!  I wrapped myself in a towel and bathrobe and headed for the door.  It was a hot bath so my face was red, and I had black circles around my eyes where the mascara had run.  There is a trail of blood from the bathroom to the door and the she-ex seemed quite amused to see me in such a state.  Of course, she did have to grab her daughter and carry her out to the car to see somebody, leaving me standing in the doorway dripping in sweat, bathwater, mascara and blood.  She was actually kinda pleasant, so I can't really bitch too much about her now.    My legs are really hacked up due to the process of getting rid of unwanted hair.  I can just imagine my CSI autopsy...."It's really tragic, this girl had no clue how to shave!"

      .  Okay, so it's Friday night, Hubby's at work, and I have all the kids.  I was able to pick up my step-daughter right after school today because she's going back to her mom's early on Sunday for a birthday party.  Usually the she-ex drops her off at 6 p.m. because that's what the "agreement" says, but since we're letting her go early on Sunday, I can have her the extra two and a half hours today.    Other times that we've picked her up right after school on Friday, mom's dropped by either Fri. night or sometime Sat. with our daughter's clothes.  I don't know when she's coming, but I want to have a bath tonight.  I'm going to tell the kids not to answer the door while I'm in the bath.  The reason for this is 95% for the safety of the kids and about 5% because if I get the opportunity to screw her over, I'm happy to take it.  Call it passive-aggressive - whatever.  This woman bugs me to no end and if she has no intention of treating me with a little respect, I'm not going to go out of my way to fit into her schedule.    My husband says that I should just tell the kids to look out the window and if it's her, to let her in.  I will not do this because I do not trust the old hag as far as I could throw her.  She wouldn't miss a chance to call FACS and let them know that the children answered the door unsupervised.  Also, I imagine that if given the chance, she'd come in and smother her daughter, cry and tell her how much she's going to miss her for two days, giving the child permission to make a scene and act like I'm holding her here against her will.  It's amazing how an otherwise happy child changes her behaviour when in the presence of her mother.    So, I'm off to a hot suddsy heaven and hope not to be disturbed

      No big story today; just a random thought:  Ya know when you drive along the escarpment or over the Skyway bridge and look at all the lights at night, and everybody says how pretty it all is......  It has always made me feel insignificant.  Is that weird?  Why can I not see the beauty in it that others see?

      I promised I'd blog today and with fifteen minutes left of this day, thought I'd better make good on my promise.  The problem is...that I have no subject to rant about.  Okay...yes I do...  One unusual thing did happen today.  My ex showed up on my doorstep.  He rode his bike for four hours in the cold to spend some time with the kids.  As great as that was, it made things quite awkward for me.  My husband is working the 3:30 to midnight shift and so we had no chaperone - not that we needed one.  Also, although I felt it to be the only humane thing to do, I was not able to offer him the spare bed and had to send him home in the dark and cold on his bicycle.  This upset my son the most.  He cried out of worry for his father.  He didn't want his dad to have to ride for another four hours in the dark and cold all alone.  I felt terrible but had no choice.    I think that this would be an excellent scenario for the scruples game.  What to do?  My ex is a grown man and made his decision to ride out here on his own.  My husband works hard to provide food and shelter for our family and does not feel that he should also provide shelter or a free ride for my ex.  I don't want to be an enabler.  I'm trying to get rid of that kind of destructive behaviour in my life - but then again, come on!  I just put a man out on the street in the cold, knowing that he was going to ride for hours in the dark on a country road on a bike with one measly little reflector while wearing a black jacket.    I'm not completely heartless though,  I did drive him part way and tossed him a pack of matches so that he could have a smoke on his way home.  Maybe the glow of the cigarette will be light enough for a car to see him and not run him over - however, depending on what exactly he is smoking, he could be riding in the middle of the road.

      This is for the men that can't read the signals and the women who love them anyway:   Seize the Day!   Marry Her!  Tell her that you can't live without her!  Take her on a romantic getaway!  She has sacrificed much for you and will continue to do so.  Let her know how much she is appreciated and that no one else can do the things that she does.  Listen carefully and make her your number one priority.  You will be happy that you did.  Trust me  On a personal note; Baby, we're good.  This is not about you, but you might want to bookmark it for future use.    And lastly, don't forget that Diamonds are a girls best friend.

      My mom and dad are in the Dominican Republic this week but not for a holiday.  They are on a missions trip.  I am so impressed with what they are doing over there.  They have brought school supplies and soccer balls for the children and are using their talents to repair buildings in this poverty stricken area.    My father recently told me that he is giving up his cell phone.  He said that for the price he pays every month for the luxury of making a few calls, he could send a needy child to school in a third world country. His words have been tugging at my heart.  We so often complain about the bills that we have to pay when maybe we should be thankful that we have electricity, food and clean water.  We always dream of what we'd do with the millions if our 649 numbers ever came up, but then I think about those poor children elsewhere who don't even have enough to eat.  For all my complaining about my life, I really am blessed.  There are so many others that have endured much more than I could even imagine.  I am ashamed of all the times that I've whined about how tough my life is.  Today, I will go to work and be thankful for my piece of crap job.  When the coffee ladies pay me in pennies, I will cherish my two cent tip.  At least I'll try.

      I just read  urlLink Christine's blog .  She gave me kudos.  She said that " I Rock" and that made me feel great!  Thanks.  I too had a fantastic time yesterday with her and would like to return the compliment.  Chrissy is my cousin and my best friend.  We are the same age and although we are two totally different people, our lives have in many ways mirrored each others.  I have great memories from our childhood; those bike ride escapes from the holiday family arguments, knocking out the screen in grandma's bedroom window while trying to get a good look at the boy across the street,  telling on the person who wiped poo on the wall and playing hide and seek in the rooms of the mansion that we were not allowed to be in are just a few examples that come to mind.  More importantly, she has been there through the hard times in my life and is always able to make me laugh at my self and others.  (but mostly others - ha ha)  After reading her blog, I had to take out Grandma's big ol' ten pound Scrabble dictionary and look up the word "dichotomous" for both meaning and pronunciation.  I was saying dick-toe-muss.   Duh.  My only defense is that I am blonde.

      The one thing that I wasn't prepared for with the divorce was the loss of his entire family.  I did not think about the fact that when I divorced him, I divorced his family too.  I really miss them and feel bad that so many things have not been cleared up between us.  I was a part of their family for about fifteen years and suddenly one day that was all gone.  He comes from a fairly large family - six kids.  His sisters became the sisters that I never had.  Of the fifteen grandchildren, there are some now that I haven't even met and of the ones that I was there for their birth, most of them do not remember me.  I find it hard to be an outsider looking in to this family that I was once a part of.  I miss the excitement that they brought to my life.  They were fun and there was always some sort of huge drama going on in at least one person's life at any given time.  I miss being a part of that.  I still love them all.  Each one has touched my life and been a part of the making of this person that I am today.    On a similar topic, What do you do with all those old pictures?  I have mine tucked away in a box.  They are beautiful treasures from another time.  I have moved on and have new pictures to display.  My parents however, still display my engagement picture from my first marriage.  What's that about?

      I have recently noticed an interesting family trait.  It is very difficult to get a straight answer from anyone in my family.  Last Christmas, someone brought up the idea of drawing names instead of buying for everyone.  We have been discussing this for ten months now and have not come to a decision.  The most common answer is "I don't care, I'll go along with what everyone else decides."  We are all (myself included) very agreeable which makes us easy to get along with in the outside world, but when we are all together - not much gets accomplished.  I think it might be a fun experiment to make some outrageous demands and see if anyone challenges me.  Ya know - stir things up a bit.  But then again, this inner need to please everyone won't let me.    So here's my honest opinion on drawing names:  I don't like it.  I enjoy buying for everybody.  There's only nine adults including myself and my husband.  If we as a couple spent $30.oo on each person, we would be spending $210.00.  If we each drew a name and had to spend about $100.00 on a large gift for one person, we'd be spending $200.oo.  So money is not an issue.  We of course would all buy for all the kids.  Of the four grandchildren, three are mine - so I do see how this is not fair for the others, but am not even sure if this is an issue for them - and if it was, I don't think that they'd tell me.   I enjoy giving.  I also enjoy the whole shopping experience..Hunting for the perfect thing for each person.  I admit that out of all the presents that I buy for Christmas, only one or two would qualify as the "perfect" gift.  Many are last minute panic gifts, but the thought is always there.  Just because I didn't find the "perfect" gift doesn't mean that I wasn't looking for it.  Anyway...I'm rambling.  Just so everyone is clear - I'd prefer to buy for everyone in the family this year.  But of course, If you all decide to draw names, I'll gladly go along.  (I know you just rolled your eyes!)

      I did nothing at work yesterday.  I usually am the one looking for things to do, always staying busy.  I figure that I am getting paid to work, so I might as well work.  Yesterday was different.  I did the bare minimum.  I didn't even try to look busy (which is an art form all its own).  The reason for this is that when I called for my schedule on Sunday, the boss answered the phone.  When I asked whether or not I was working the next day, he yelled at me!  "What's wrong with you?  Janet, It's Sunday in the middle of football!  Call back tomorrow." I had been careful not to call during the busy dinner rush.  I didn't realize that watching football was more important than running a restaurant, so yesterday I decided that standing around doing nothing would be acceptable.  I was even hoping to get the Young and the Restless on one of the tv's.  I had five customers all together in the four hours that I worked.  My total read was under $50.00.  I have asked him for more hours.  I wanted to open Mon-Fri.  He has been giving me two or three shifts per week and they are on the lightest days.  I am finally fed up with this job and am looking for another.    The rebellious person in me really wants to get caught doing nothing.  I secretly want to make a scene and walk out the door telling him where he can stick his job.  What have I got to lose?  I've given this a lot of thought.  My leaving would not hurt any of my co-workers - in fact - it would add excitement to their day and if they took over for me they might be lucky enough to make an extra ten bucks.  This is what fantasies are made of!  I doubt I'd have the guts to do it, but then again - ya never know.

      This morning NOBODY wanted to get out of bed and go to work or school.  We were all tired, still feeling the effects of the turkey.  I'm getting ready for work and can't find my pants!  I've looked everywhere!  I'm going to have to improvise.  I have a pair of black capri's.  Is it wrong to wear them after labour day?  I wonder if the boss would care.  I doubt that any of the non-existent customers would notice.  I don't expect to make any money today.  Tuesday's are usually dead at the restaurant - especially after a holiday.  I've got to find a better job!  I'll just go today and put in my time.  It's just so sad that my time is only worth $5.95.  Anyway, I've got nothing to complain about after reading  urlLink Christine's blog  today.  Okay, I've got my fake smile on - ready to start my day.  Now if I could only find my pants....

      Last night we had lots of turkey and pie.  When that was over, we cleared the table and sat down to a friendly family game of Risk.  We started with six players and by the time it got down to four players, it was looking like hubby was going to take over the world.  He did make a crucial mistake though...He went to the washroom.  In the time that he was gone, an alliance was quickly made with the remaining three players and within two turns, hubby was eliminated from the game.  As good as we all felt about ourselves taking out the strongest player was nothing compared to how pissed off he was!  My husband hates to lose, in fact he has bumped my brother from the number one spot on the Most Competitive People I Know list.  He didn't get mad and yell and throw things...That's not his style.  He went in to the kitchen and cleaned up silently - which I think is an excellent way to deal with your feelings of failure.    I have noticed this need to be the best in other areas of his life such as tennis, driving and even cooking.  Really, it is one of the things that I both love and hate about him.  I love it because he puts his all into everything he does.  He's always striving to be better and I really admire that about him.  I don't like it so much, because there isn't much that I can do better than him.  I want to be the best sometimes too ya know.  But really, he's very good at a lot of things.    I remember that my Grandma never liked to play the Risk game.  It could have been that she didn't like us to play war but I think it was that everyone got mad at each other.  Risk is a game of strategy, but it's JUST A GAME!  Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.  Chill out people and be THANKFUL that you are not really in charge of all the army's of the world.  I know I am - Thankful that is.  Happy Thanksgiving.

      What a day yesterday was!  Aside from the four dollar parking fee, the emergency room experience was fairly quick and painless.  The most interesting part of my day was last night when an uninvited woman barged into my house and called me a liar.  Now, I have never, ever been a violent person, but I was about to go medieval on this bitch.  It's a good thing that the children were present or I would have seriously kicked her ass out the door.  How dare she!  I am amazed at myself.  When did I turn from this quiet, shy doormat into this more aggressive person that I've become?  And is it a good thing?

      It looks like I'll be taking a trip to the emergency room this morning.  My daughter just got the courage to tell me that a couple of days ago while at school, she stuck a pencil in her ear and the eraser broke off.  She has had an eraser in her ear for two days.  I took a pair of tweezers and tried to pull it out, but just ended up pushing it in further.  I've been lucky up until now that I've never had to take my kids to the emergency.  I have a ten year old and a seven year old.  I'm thinking that by the time that I was seven, I must have been in emergency at least a handful of times.  Thankfully, this isn't serious.  It's just a wrinkle in the busy day that I had planned.  I will clean the oven later.

      The city of Hamilton has closed their schools this week for the cycling championships.  Huh????  I don't get it.  Why keep hundreds (maybe thousands) of kids at home and burden parents for the cost of extra day care while they are at work?  Is it just the schools or did the whole city shut down?  Has Stelco given their employees the week off to watch skinny men in spandex pedal up a hill?  This whole situation confuses me.  I'm sure that arrangements could have been made to keep the kids in school.   My kids didn't get the week off when Vijay Singh was in town to play golf!  The funniest thing is that my ex asked me if our kids were off school this week.  He's in Hamilton...We're in Niagara - totally different school boards - and NO, a few cyclists in the steel city did not keep my kids from reading and arithmetic.

      Yesterday, my daughter told me about a friend at school whose mother apparently knows my ex-husband.  I don't know who this woman is.  I have never heard her name before and am confused because I've known him and his family since we were both sixteen years old.  This doesn't bother me - in fact, the possibilities amuse me.     I'm not feeling "blah" anymore.  There was not a cloud in the sky today which helped with my mood a lot I think.  But what made today so special was the way it began.  Instead of the same ol' morning routine that I complained about yesterday, I got to sleep in today.  Hubby got up with the kids and got them ready for school this morning.  He did an excellent job too!  Thanks Baby.  You made my day!   And a final random thought....(I know I'm all over the place today)  When you go out for dinner, does it bother you to see a bandaid on the servers' finger?  While preparing dinner for the family yesterday, I was involved in a tragic cheese grating accident.  Nothing serious really, just a bloody knuckle.  (Don't worry - none got in the cheese)  Today while at work, I felt very conscious of the bandaid on my finger.  I wondered if the customers would notice and be repulsed by it.  Luckily, I only had three tables.  LOL  Why do I bother?

      I do my best thinking in the bathtub.  It's my peaceful, quiet place.  Having a bath is one of my favorite luxury's.  That's where most of my blogs come from actually.  Maybe I should call them "bathtub ponderings" or something like that.  Now I know that it's a girl thing.   It seems to be against the guy code to take a bath.  To a man, having a bath is equivalent to peeing while sitting down - it just isn't done.  But for me, it's paradise.  I'm a lucky girl to have a house with a bathtub.  When I get to heaven, My place will have a giant bathroom with a large tub, and an endless supply of hot water and bubbles.   Mmmmmmm

      I had a great day yesterday, and thought I'd brag about it!....Slept in, Got two new tires for the car, Went Christmas shopping and got myself a new purse, Finalized some Christmas plans, Had dinner at the Keg, Went to the casino and won $1600.00!!!!  On top of all that, it was a good hair day too!  I'm happy.  Didn't get much sleep last night, but woke up this morning with a smile on my face.  Today's going to be another good day...I can feel it!

      Hubby told me that he thought that I had a favourite child.  I was incredibly offended at this statement!  I thought that I treated the kids equally.  I love them all unconditionally.  I was shocked to hear that he perceived my relationship with the kids this way and I wonder if I'm giving off the signal that I prefer one child over another.    They are given responsibilities, freedoms and discipline based on their age, personalities and gender - that can't be helped.  They all have the same rules to abide by, but they are each individuals and have to be treated accordingly.    The thought that my kids might think that I have a favourite makes me physically sick.  I have to find a way to change my behaviour while maintaining consistency with the way the kids are raised.  (Does that make any sense at all???)    I think that I have the best kids in the world!  I am so proud of them and could never choose between them.  I hope they know that.

      An update on the she-ex:  She called hubby back last night and demanded that he bring over the clothes that his daughter had left at our house.  (The only reason that I didn't send them home in the first place was because I had washed them and they weren't dry yet)  He of course jumped when she said to and headed over.  I warned him that the only reason that she wanted him there was to yell at him.  Once again, I was right.  45 min. later, he returns home.  She had some " concerns " that her daughter was in danger at our house.   Last week, while hubby was putting up the Christmas lights, he let the kids climb the ladder to the roof.  He met them at the top, I held the ladder at the bottom.  They were not in danger as we were extremely careful.  I can see though, how she'd freak out about that one.  I might have too if I were her.  Everything else she said though was completely irrational!  She's concerned that we let the kids watch PG-13 movies.  It doesn't matter that she, her sister and her sister's girlfriend use the F-word often in the house.  Then she says to my husband, "What if our daughter starts to smoke?"     First of all, she's only six years old.  Second, my husband and I do not smoke and have talked to the kids many times about the dangers of smoking.  And Finally, The she-ex and her sister smoke like chimneys!  Hello....If the girl decides to smoke, she'll only be mirroring her lunatic mother's behaviour.  How she thought that she could put that on us, I have no idea!    The one that made me laugh the most though, was that she demanded to see MY tax returns.  Ha Ha Ha  If she thinks that she's going to somehow get a portion of my $5.95/hr, she's crazier than I thought.  I'd almost like to see her haul us back into court again.  Any judge in his/her right mind would see that she's nuts.    I think that she's just pissed off that her spousal amount will be going down drastically in January and she hasn't found another man to mooch off of yet.  Although, I must say that her sister (now her new roomie) is looking more and more like a man every day.   Did you know that  mooch  is really a word?  When I did my spell check, I was surprised to find out that it didn't come up!

      Had another run-in with the she-ex.  Hubby called her to let her know that their daughter was just finishing her dinner and that we'd drop her off at home a half hour later.  This was not good enough for the old hag.  She had her sister call back to tell us to bring the girl home immediately.  Hubby told the butch that it was none of her business.    When I dropped my step daughter off, both the she-ex and her butch sister came out into the driveway to yell at me.  They started bitching at me about my husband and it ticked them off that he stood up to them and didn't take their crap.  Yeah Hunny!  I laughed at their antics and got in the car and left as they shouted obscenities at me.  They were the ones making a scene and yelling at me and in an attempt to land the killer blow, the she-ex yells "you know who's business it's none of...It's none of YOUR business!"    WHATEVER!  She hates it when I say that :-)

      The most exciting thing in my life today so far is my new toaster!  It actually works.  Toasts beautifully, big enough for bagels, nice tight crumb tray.  Thank God for little miracles.    The kids are excited about it too.  They both figured that the new toaster would get them off to school earlier in the morning.  I told them that it was never the toaster that made us late in the mornings...But today, they were ten minutes early!     I'm hoping that this magic toaster can also pick lottery numbers.

      Work sucked today more than usual.  I didn't have any tables for the first three hours and then in total I had four.  One used a coupon, so the bill was low - so was the tip.  Another table paid with visa but then took both copies with them so again - no tip.  The last table I had to actually ask them to pay their bill because I needed to go home.  They paid, I gave them their change and then left.  If they left a tip, it went to the person that cleared the table.  What a sucky day.  One of the regulars at the bar died and today was his funeral.  Quite a few people came back for drinks and free pizza.  The bartender got the drinks....I got the free pizza.   Again, no tips for me.  Oh well.  You take the good with the bad I guess.

      I got home from picking up the kids and checked my phone messages.  There was one from my Grandmother.  She wants to take us to her church's Christmas dinner.  It's not something that we are going to want to do, but if it will make my Grandma happy - I'll go this year.  Grandma said that she's also going to be bringing the boys that rent rooms from her.  I'll be surprised if they don't all find excuses to get out of it.  Anyway, I haven't met these new guys.  She gets new students in every six months and has been pretty lucky so far.  Most of these students have been very kind and helpful to her.    She was telling me about her new students a few weeks ago.  She said that the one who rents the room upstairs is a "dark skinned fellow....but he really is very nice."  I wondered why she thought that I'd be surprised that a dark skinned fellow was nice, but decided to let it go.  Tonight she made a similar comment on my voice mail.  She said that she wondered what people at the church would think when she showed up with a black man, and then added that "he is a very nice young man though".  I don't think that Grandma realized that I am married to a "dark skinned man" when she made her comments.    Grandma is a very loving lady and would treat every person equally regardless of their skin colour.  It just strikes me that things must have been so different in her day.  I have not seen the prejudices that so many talk about.  My kids were completely colour blind until a few years ago.  They were shocked when I told them that their aunt was black.  They hadn't noticed.  My husband, an Arab, has not been harassed because of his skin colour - even after 911.  I wonder why my Grandma had the subconscious need to apologize for being in the presence of a black man, and why she would be more concerned about that than about being seen with her other borders whom have multiple facial piercings.  I'm sure that she has no idea that her comments were offensive, and I know that she meant no harm.  I am just fascinated by the underlying bigotry and am curious as to where it came from.    The whole thing just seems so  Jerry Springer  to me.

      So far, all four of my football teams are winning today!  OMG Oakland might actually win a game!  Not that   I   have any money on today's games.  It just means that I can hold my head up high.  Another Sunday without going to church.  I had a couple of contract jobs to do today.  Football, shopping and laundry!  That's my day today.  Going to pick up the kids now.  No more solitude for another two weeks.  I do miss their grubby little faces though.

      Hey, I feel a lot better today!!!  The heaviness has been lifted and my face can now make a smile!  I'm still stuffed up and my voice is that of an older muscular woman who has smoked all her life, but other than that I feel pretty good.  I'm not even tired!    Our neighbor works with computers and came over last night to check ours out.  He restored our D drive but was concerned when he couldn't get explorer to come up.  He kept saying: "This isn't good...This isn't right...This concerns me."  He says it's fixable, but will take a lot of time and work.  He thinks it's easier to just erase the hard drive and start over.  We've got a lot of junk on here.  The only thing that I'm worried about are our picture files.  I don't want to lose them.  Although, I'll be glad to see the ones entitled "beautiful Cindy and sexy Cindy" gone!  Good riddance.    Off to work now - got to make some money.  The creditors have been calling and I don't want to be home when the next one rings.

      It's been a very busy week and I haven't been feeling good so that's why I haven't blogged.  I got to sleep in today which felt great!  I had a chocolate milk and one of Jayme's brownies for breakfast.  Mmmmmm yummy!  Didn't go to church this morning.  I don't want to go out at all today.  It's too cold.  Last night, my family came over and took me out for dinner.  It was so nice to have everyone there.  Well, actually, hubby had to work, but everyone else was there.  I have a great family.  I always have a good time when they're around.    We picked names for Christmas last night.  Somebody finally made that decision.  It means that I don't get to go to the mall as often this year, but maybe that's a good thing.    As you can probably tell, I didn't put a whole lot of thought into my blog today.  I think I'll go and have a bath.  That should clear my head.  Then I think I'll try to spend some time with the kids.  It's football day today so I guess it's my turn to keep the kids occupied so hubby can have some down time.

       IT'S MY PARTY AND I'LL CRY IF I WANT TO...   I don't want to go to work today.  I just want to crawl back into bed.  Wish I could.  I woke up this morning with a bad case of hives.  My right eye is swollen half shut and I look like I'm about 83, not 33.  So I took two Benadryll which will put drowsy on top of my already way-too-tired state.  Good job I don't have to operate any heavy machinery.  (Except of course the van-I'm not walking to work)  In other good news...our computer seems to have picked up a virus and sent it to everyone in our address books.  I feel so dirty.    Also, Hubby lost his second job and his "real job" is threatening layoffs in the near future.  This means that I've got to kick it up a notch and really start looking for something full time.  I'm not crazy about change.  This is so depressing.  Well, thanks for coming to my pity party.  I'll see you again soon.

      Haven't blogged for a couple of days.  Maybe I'll blog twice today to make up for it.  The weekend was alright.  We went to the casino and actually won some money for a change!  Now hubby doesn't have to worry about how he's going to pay the she-ex this month.  I hate it when he tells me that we can't go out for dinner because we need to save our money to pay her!  AARRGGHH!  I'm not going to go off about that right now though...It's an old subject that just won't die.  New topic...  Tomorrow I will be 33.  I don't enjoy birthdays anymore.  Getting older is a harsh reality.  I'm now older than most of my co-workers and some of the management.  That sucks. Also, I have to get my emissions test and stickers renewed today.  It's bad enough that I have to deal with getting old.  Now the government makes me pay them on my birthday.  Talk about kicking a girl when she's down!    I guess with age comes wisdom.  Whoopee!  I have some wisdom now, been through some stuff, I've got some advise to give - but what good's it going to do?  Who's going to listen?  I know I didn't when I was younger.  I'm thinking that I'd gladly give up all this "wisdom" to go back to the ignorant bliss that comes with youth.

      New Years Eve....Time for the resolution.  I don't have one this year.  Usually it's to eat right and exercise, but that never lasts - so why bother?  I have a few things in my life that I want to work on, but the New years eve resolution thing is just too much pressure.  I won't set myself up to fail again.    I'm working today and then tonight we're going to a friends house to play poker.  I hate poker and am not looking forward to this part of the night, but Hubby and the rest of them are really excited about it.  I really don't feel like drinking much either.  I'll volunteer to be the DD tonight.  It'll be fun to get together though.  We pick up the kids tomorrow!  I wonder what kind of drama that event will bring.  I guess we'll have to wait and see....

      Back to work today, therefore, back to blogging.  It was a great Christmas!!!!    On the 24th we woke up as if it was Christmas day, and the kids all opened up their presents.  We told the youngest that Santa had arranged to come early to our house.  My daughter told her that Santa wasn't real, but she didn't believe it.  She actually heard him come in through the front door apparently.  (We don't have a chimney)  The kids did good, but as for who got the most spoiled this year....That was ME!  I got both a cell phone and a digital camera!  I'll privately email you my new number and some Christmas pics soon.  After a whole day of putting together and playing with all the new toys, we drove the kids to the Ex's.  First to the she-ex who freaked out and caused another scene in front of the girl.  This time it was about New Years Eve.  She had thought that we had discussed that we would take our daughter for that night, when really we had said that we'd pick her up on New Years day.  Whatever...Didn't have to be a big deal, but she made it into one.  When we said that we'd take her on New Years Eve to make it easier for her, she told us that she would not allow us to get a babysitter!  Okay then, too bad for her - she can either cancel her plans or pay for a babysitter that night.  We offered, but won't offer again.  We'll see what happens when we attempt to pick her up on the 1st.  After that we took the other two to the he-ex who was much easier to get along with.  My Hubby actually insisted on buying him a Christmas present!  (A ten dollar phone card)  I was amazed and impressed with his generosity because usually I hear about what the he-ex owes me.  Don't you just love little Christmas miracles?  Dropped by my parents place after that and played a game of Risk.  Mom won and I came in second place.  (Remember, Hubby doesn't like to lose)    Christmas morning was quiet, we slept in and then attempted to clean the house a bit.  I was able to spend more than ten minutes getting ready to go out which was nice.  We went down to my brother's place and had Christmas dinner there.  Dinner was amazing and my sister in law made everything look so easy!  It's nice to be a guest and not the hostess sometimes.  We had a relaxing and fun evening.  I didn't feel the absence of the kids as much as I thought that I would have.    The next couple of days were spent mostly in my house coat lounging around.  At night we went to a friends house.  The first night we played Risk.  I won! (Loss number two for Hubby)  The second night, we played Yatzee.  Again, I had a better overall score than Hubby did.  He's coping well.  I finally met the "best friend" last night.  Cool guy.      So, like I said, back to work today.  I've got new pants to wear and a new hair colour.  (Every time I try for blonde I end up with yellow)  My goal today is to fit something into my diet that's not chocolate.  Mmmm the holidays!

      Well, the best friend didn't show.  Too busy I guess.    Today's my last day of work before Christmas and I really wanted to bring something in, but having not baked this year, I've got nothing but a box of After Eights, and they just don't seem appropriate.  I dunno, maybe I'll bring them anyway.  Hubby has been recalled back to work after the holidays, so that's good news.  Maybe now he'll relax and feel free to spend some time at home instead of delivering pizzas 16 hours a day.  I need some quality time in big quantities!  The she-ex refrained from calling or stopping by for a full day yesterday so I expect to hear from her today.  She is insistent on us drugging her daughter up three times a day with Motrin, Dimetapp and Cefprozil.  I guess Mommy's trying to pass on her expensive drug habit to the next generation.  If she'd just stop smoking in the house, maybe her daughter wouldn't have such a bad recurring cough - but that's just my diagnosis.    Lots of wrapping to do tonight.  Hope I've got everything, cause I don't want to fight the crowds at the store this evening.  Yah, I've got enough stuff.  Man we're spoiled!

      Sorry Fans...Haven't had much to say lately.  The weekend was good, kids had fun, the house is trashed and the fridge is full of left overs.    Hubby's "best friend" is coming for a visit today.  He lives in Japan and is here for Christmas holidays I guess.  It's only by coincidence that Hubby even found out that he's in town.  It seems that he ran into his  other  best friend who told him the news.    I don't mean to rain on his parade, but if he was really his best friend, don't you think that they would have kept in touch all these years, and when he got back into town, wouldn't his best friend look him up?  Anyway, I'm looking forward to meeting this man who has had such a huge impact on my husbands life.  Do we need to have a little something under the tree for him?  Probably would be the proper thing to do.  I have extra candles and chocolate.  Does that work for a guy?

      Happy Birthday Dave!!!!  Once again, I wrote a blog and it somehow got lost.   Argh!  That's sooo frustrating!  What a waste of time.  I have to go to work now, but will try to blog later tonight.   urlLink Christine's blog  today made me laugh.

      Starting to feel much better.  It's been a rough week with everybody sick.  Just got a call that child #3 is also sick now and won't be able to come for her visit tomorrow.    I can't believe that I lost a whole week of Christmas shopping, cleaning and planning!  I've got everybody coming over on Saturday and I'm totally disorganized and physically exhausted.    As of last night, I now have absolutely NO chance of winning the football pool.  Now for the good news:  Sandra won Survivor! - She was my girl!!! Saddam has been captured - duh, in case you hadn't heard and...The He-ex got himself a cell phone!!!  Now I can actually get a hold of him if there is an emergency with the kids.

      Yesterday I felt great.  Today I feel like I've been hit by a train.  I've got what the kids had...A temperature of 101, headache and general all over body aches.  Of course, I was supposed to be at work today.    I was all ready to go shopping yesterday afternoon, when the school called and I had to pick up my daughter because she still wasn't feeling good.  I did still get a few things done last night though before the coughing began.  Then, at about 11:30, My body turned on me.  I could hardly walk, my back hurt so bad.  Now, I've called in sick again to work (Tuesday it was to look after the kids) and Hubby just got laid off!  We need fundage!!!!  Oh well, It will all work out...It always does.

       Oh, the Greed...   Both kids back in school today.  I'm finally going Christmas shopping!!!  The she-ex has made a new habit of calling my husband on his cell phone and asking him to drop off the clothes that her daughter forgot at our house.  Usually, these clothes are in the laundry hamper or I'm already in the process of washing them for her.  The other night, she did this, so I stopped what I was doing and sorted through the pile of dirty clothes and put her daughters stuff in a plastic bag.  Hubby brought them over.  The she-ex says that there is a sweater that was not in the bag and that's specifically what she was looking for.   "It's Emily's only sweater!"  she says.  Bull shit!  First of all, the girl has plenty of sweaters and even if she didn't, you'd think that $750.00 a month in child support would afford her to buy the girl some warm clothes.  I found the sweater at the bottom of the closet and told Hubby that I'd call the she-ex and tell her that she could come and pick it up - but no...He dropped it off later that night.    Well, Yesterday, the girl was NOT wearing the sweater!  Seems that she had found some other clothes to wear and it really wasn't that urgent to get back what belonged to her.  The kids had a school Christmas concert last night.  The she-ex asked me to put a red pony-tail elastic in her daughters hair.  No problem.  I'm fighting the urge today to call her up and tell her that I really need that red hair elastic back immediately!  After all, It does belong to me.

      I've got two sick kids today, both with temperatures of about 101.  One went to bed voluntarily at 6:30 last night and the other was up at 4 a.m. throwing up.  Both want to go to school today.  It's strange that they are begging me to let them go, and I'm saying No.  It seems that from now until Christmas, they won't be doing any actual work at school.  I have to keep them home though, I'm sure other parents don't want to be up all night cleaning vomit out of a carpet.  I've called in to work to see if they can replace me today.  Hubby won't like that, but I don't really have much choice.    Last night I struggled to balance my charismatic Christian teaching with my more traditional Christian teaching.  I prayed with the kids and also commanded the sickness to leave their bodies.  The later part felt very awkward so I obviously wasn't doing it out of faith - just hope I guess.  I know God heals and I don't believe that he wants us to be sick, however, I'm having trouble deciding how to word my prayers on this subject.  How do I lead and teach my kids when I'm not really sure what I believe?....Which reminds me of something else...  When we won all that money at the casino a week ago, Hubby remembered to thank God before it had even crossed my mind.  And I thought that I was the spiritual one!

      Well, the party weekend is over.  My son's birthday party went really well.  He said he had a great time.  It seems that everyone at my work Christmas party was there for the same reasons that I was - just to put in an appearance.  Most of us left at 10:00.  It was nice to have the owners serve me for a change though, but then I wondered....Am I supposed to tip??   I didn't.     It turns out that just before the party, the boss laid off about five of the servers.  I wasn't one of them - I guess I'm appreciated???

      Things are going well so far today...One party down, one to go!  I haven't done the house cleaning yet, but ya know what?  I don't care much.    Toys R Us advertised a sale on Bratz dolls starting today.  In addition to the low price, they were giving away an extra set of clothes ($10.00 value) with each doll.  As I said, the sale started today.  I arrived at about 1:30p.m. this afternoon, and they were all out of the extra clothes already!  Also, they had no blonde Bratz girls.  I picked up two Bratz girls and two Bratz boys and have rainchecks for the free-bees.    Hubby works with some real jack-ass's!!!  We were at the kids Christmas party this morning and there were a few select jerks who brought their personal feuds with each other to the party.  Unbelievable how they were acting in front of their kids and wives.  The immaturity is astounding!  It was nice to see the real men stand up for what was right though.  I don't know how my husband is able to work with these assholes every day and still come home with a smile on his face.  I know I'm being vague. Sorry, but I'd rather not elaborate.  I'm just glad that I married a man and not a boy.    Okay, off to party number two!  L8r :-)

      Busy weekend ahead, and it starts right now!  Have to be at the school in an hour for parent-teacher interviews.  Then, off to work.  Tomorrow is Hubby's work kids Christmas party and then my son's birthday party.  I also have a job to squeeze in sometime on Saturday.    Doesn't sound like much, but when you add house cleaning around three kids and taking my brother-in-law out shopping, Every time slot is filled!  Then, Sunday night is my work Christmas party.  I have to buy a secret Santa gift still.  I'm only going to look like a team player.  I'll stay for an hour or two and then go back home where I'm comfortable.    The boss says that spouses are not invited to the party, so I'm going alone.  I find this very strange, and his reason is even stranger.....  He says that he doesn't want a spouse to see how well the staff gets along and think that there is more going on than there really is.  I'm not aware of any secret affairs going on at work and to tell the truth,  I don't think that the staff gets along that well anyway!   Hubby is offended at not being invited - and I don't blame him (however, I think he's more upset about missing out on some free food).  Whatever.  I'll go in an attempt not to look anti-social.

      The last few weeks have been all about Christmas for me.  I've decorated and done a lot of shopping.  (Only about half done though).  It's funny because we've picked names this year within my family.  I have found a ton of stuff to buy for the people that I'm not allowed to buy for, but am having some difficulty finding the right thing for the ones that I am buying for.    The gift that I buy will be the only gift that this person gets....That's a lot of pressure!  As for shopping within my immediate family (Hubby, kids), I really haven't begun.  Yes, I've bought stuff, but I've been doing my Grandmothers shopping and my brother-in-law's shopping too.    Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining.  I love Christmas and everything that goes along with it, but with less than three weeks left, I'm starting to panic.   Ho Ho Ho

      Sometimes, when I have nothing better to do, I go into  urlLink Blogger  and check out some of the most recently posted blogs.  I have found that some people, unlike myself, have a lot of imagination and have thought up some pretty cool names for their blogs.    That's why today, I've changed the name of my blog from  Stuff  (boring) to  Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers  which is much more interesting I think.  It doesn't mean a thing...It's just a tongue twister that the kids and I were having fun with last night.  It was either that or, Rubber Baby Booger Buggies - but I didn't want to put booger in my title.  More on this later.

      Everybody else was still there at work yesterday and the meeting was pretty positive.  They were asking for our suggestions on how to improve the restaurant.  I had to bring my daughter to the meeting as there was no way I was going to pay for a babysitter.   Some of the suggestions included, Kids eat free, birthday clubs, free dinner on your birthday...etc.  Every time that the word birthday was mentioned, my daughter put up her hand.  She desperately wanted to tell everyone that it was her birthday.  At the end of the meeting, she got her chance and was offered chocolate ice cream which she gladly accepted.  During the meeting, she was drawing pictures.  She decided that she wanted to give one to my boss.  She gave him the one with three crosses on it.  It said "Jesus loves me".   She told me later that she wanted him to know that we believed in Jesus.  I'm ashamed to say that I have mixed feelings about this.  Part of me is very proud of her.  The other part is a bit embarrassed.  I'm mostly proud though.  The guinea pig is fitting in to our family nicely.  Hubby seems to have grown attached to it.  Last night when he came home from work (midnight) he took it out and cuddled with it for a couple of hours in front of the tv (When I say "it", I'm still referring to the guinea pig....Just thought I'd clarify)    The kids were hoping for a snow day today but unfortunately, school was open.  It took me 20 minutes to scrape the ice of both vehicles this morning.  Winter sucks.  I wish I had taken my parents up on their offer to go with them to Florida.

      I spent the weekend researching and shopping for a Guinea Pig for my daughter's 8th birthday which is today.  So, 100 dollars later (the bulk of the cost was the cage) and we now are keeping and feeding and handling a rodent!  I have to admit that it is kinda cute and I did have fun picking out the right one.  The kids are happy.  Back to work today.  I guess I will find out today what the  New direction  is with the restaurant.  I wonder how many co-workers will be left.

      Work was interesting yesterday.  In a shocking twist, the biggest kiss-ass employee (previously mentioned in Fridays blog) was fired.  The reason..."Restaurant is going in a different direction."  This girl has been there for years and although I have had issues with her, she is a very dedicated employee.  Nobody will tell her why she's fired other than the reason given above.  I think that she deserves better.  Apparently, there are more firings to come.  One person I know got wind of this and decided to quit first.  I was also told that I was not one of the people that would be getting the boot.  (I hope my source is reliable!)  Something is definitely up - I just don't know what it is.    We have another meeting Monday night with a staff appreciation hour following - which means cheap drinks at the bar.  I wonder how many staff members will be left and if we will get an explanation as to why things have changed.  I will not be staying for happy hour.  When I drink I get much more vocal than usual.  I'd rather just sit back and listen and take it all in-besides, I've got better things to do.  I hear there's a new restaurant opening up down the road.  I might apply.  Really, I'd like to get out of the restaurant business, but where to go - I do not know.  Hubby and I are working to drastically decrease our debt this year.  A good paying job for me would help.  It might be time for a change.

      Today will be a regular day like the rest.  Work, homework, dishes, laundry, sleep.    I had two tables at work yesterday, and after I bought my own lunch, I came home with six bucks.  The van was on empty, so I dug through my heavy wallet and was able to come up with $60.00 for gas...$45 of it was in change!   Not dimes and nickels, but toonies and loonies and about five bucks in quarters.  I put it all in a plastic bag and went to crappy tire for some gas.  ( I had the coupon for 4x CT money also)  When I went in to pay the girl, I apologized for all the change, but the woman was a bitch about it.  She counted it out bit by bit, putting handfuls of change behind the counter where I couldn't see it.  She says that I only gave her $58.  By this time, there were two people in line behind me.  I had to borrow a toonie from my son who luckily came in to buy smarties with his own fortune.   It pisses me off that I was ripped off for two bucks.  If the chick didn't have an attitude, I wouldn't have minded so much.   Just picture it...Me with no make-up, my hair tied back, sweats, a dirty jacket, a coupon and a plastic bag full of money.  An eleven year old who saves the day.  Dirty looks from everyone in the kiosk.  It was a classic white trash moment.

      I just read  urlLink Christine 's blog and she mentions my name like four times, each one highlighted with a link to this site.  I hope you're not disappointed when I have nothing interesting to say today.  Yes, I did notice that guy with the laptop as when I walked in, he looked up at me momentarily.  Yeah, loser....Maybe he was with the boobie chick who was also looking desperately for attention.  It was a nice afternoon.  The kids had fun.  I noticed that the advertisement bar at the top of my blog is blank today, and I wonder why?  Is my site soooo boring that it's not worth advertising on?  I'm both insulted and amused.  Both of our TV's are broken which made the weekend actually pretty good - we were forced to do other things rather than watch TV or play xbox.  The kitchen seemed to be the centre of our house this weekend instead of the big black box in the living room which we always gather around.  It's been nice, but I will need it fixed before the beginning of Survivor All-stars!  Well, back to work this morning...I don't think the dishwasher is fixed yet so today  could be  the day that I quit.  It won't be, but I can dream can't I?  I must have  door mat  tattooed on my forehead.  Here's a funny thing...I just did my spell check and they suggested that I use the word Toronto to replace doormat!!!!!  Isn't that strange?   How do you get Toronto from doormat?  Hmmmm

      It's been a busy week so far.  Tonight's the first night this week that I don't have to go anywhere, so I can finally sit down and blog.  Although I've got nothing exciting to talk about, I thought that I'd better write something because if you check this site everyday, you've been reading for six days that Hubby and I had a fight.  It seems like so long ago...I've moved past it, but this blog hasn't - until now.  So, like I said, nothing much exciting has happened.  Work sucked more than usual this week because the dish washer is broken.  I have had to wash the entire restaurants dishes by hand each day.  I hate doing dishes at home, and now have to wash hundreds of plates a day at work.  I don't get tipped when I'm in the back washing dishes, so I think that I should get paid extra for my time back there.  $5.95 is way to low in my opinion.   I've been really good at keeping out of the gossip and "politics" at work up until now.  Sure, people tell me stuff, but I keep it to myself and don't get involved.  I've learned some stuff in the last couple of days that involves a plot against a friend of mine there and it pisses me off!  Now it's difficult to go in each day and be nice to these two-faced people.  I prefer to go in, do my job and leave, but now it's gotten messy.  Yesterday, I was talking to the restaurants biggest kiss-ass employee within earshot of the boss.  She asked me why I was there so late and so I told her that it takes a long time to do the dishes by hand.  She says to me (loudly) that she enjoys doing them by hand and that she thinks that it's faster that way than with a dishwasher!  She wouldn't know!  By the time that she gets there at night, there's a student in the back washing them for her.  It's only us lowly day people that have to do it for ourselves.     Well, I've got to go and iron my uniform and head off to the waste of time that I call a job.  Now I understand why hubby's embarrassed of where I work.  It's way below me.

      Hubby and I had our first "fight" yesterday.  Nothing big, just a lot of tension and emotion.  It's the first time that I can remember being really angry with him.  Neither one of us yelled, or called each other names and yet the kids knew that something was up.  Part way through the evening, my son asked me, "Mom, Are you guys going to get a divorce?"  He said it in a joking way, and later said to me that he was just kidding, but his question struck me like a ton of bricks!  This "fight" was nothing like the ones he'd witnessed between his father and I a few years ago.   They  were real fights - daily - the kind that leaves divorce or death as the only two ways out.  I wonder what went through the kids minds last night when they saw my emotional state.  I remember as a kid how I felt when my parents would argue.  After going through a divorce, I imagine that the kids might feel less secure than they would have had their parents not broken up.  I obviously still carry a lot of guilt about being divorced.  I just hope that the kids understand that it was the most difficult decision of my life and one that I would not make lightly.  I hope that they see the strength of our current family relationship.  I guess as they grow older and mature that they will be able to understand why I made the decision that I did and changed the path of their lives.    Back to last night...Hubby came home with a peace offering - a box of doughnuts!  He said that he had thought about roses, but decided on the doughnuts instead.  I guess he was trying to make peace with himself because he proceeded to eat three of them in a row!  Roses would have been a more excellent choice, but like he said, "It's the thought that counts"   NOT!!      Oh well,  All is forgiven and I won't be contacting a lawyer any time soon.

      I worked for nothing today.  I accepted a job over the phone without asking what the pay was.  I figured that it would get me "in" with this company.  I have done some work for this company before, but not of this sort.   Anyhow, it turns out that the pay is only $8.oo American.  I had to download and print paperwork, drive over the river to the States, find this place (I got lost of course), spent an hour there, drove home, filled in my report, faxed to a long distance number and mailed my original copies by snail mail.  Did I mention the $3.50 toll that I had to pay?  They had better offer me some  Good, Well paying  jobs now!  Oh well, at least I got the experience that I was looking for.    What's up with Canada's border security?  On the way back in to the country, the border guard asked me two questions:  "How many people?"  to which I answered, "Just me" and "Anything to declare?" to which I answered, "Nothun".    He then nodded at me to go ahead.  Not that I wanted to be held up with a bunch of questions or an invasive search of the vehicle, but that just seemed too easy!   The U.S. is fingerprinting and photographing people and our guy is sitting on his ass with his feet up.   Canadians in general are so laid back and easy going.  It's just a matter of time before someone takes advantage of that and rocks our world - just my opinion.

      Wow, It's been a while.  Nothing really blog-worthy has happened yet this year, but I thought I'd better check in.     It's been great to have the kids home.  They all played together so well over the weekend.  It was continuous laughter and smiles.  I had a really good time with them playing games, doing Christmas crafts and puzzles.  We went skating on Sunday.  I took lots of pictures -  Loving  my new camera!!!!  The Ex's haven't given us much trouble.  The she-ex had a mini tantrum New Years Day, but Hubby put her in her place.  She didn't even freak out when we told her that she sent her child to our house again with lice.  Man, that shampoo's expensive! I called the He-ex on his cell only to find that he's on the other side of the country.  Won't be taking the kids this weekend, which is fine with me.  My son won't have to miss another one of his friends birthday parties - so it all worked out.  A friend of mine met someone over the holidays and is falling in love.  It's so cool to see someone in those first blissful weeks of a relationship.  When I walked into work yesterday , she was playing these love songs on the sound system.  I'm happy for her, but can see how this sugary stuff might soon get very irritating....For me.  When was the last time someone brought flowers in to work for me?  Anyone?...  No, I can't remember either.

      It's probably way too soon to be blogging about this, but I've got to put it out there.  Hubby came home last night and talked to me about a business opportunity.  It sounds pretty good and we are both interested.  I have reservations only about what it will do to our family and marriage if we go into business together.  Also, this year we were supposed to be paying off our debts, not borrowing for a business - but it could be very good for our future.  I've got lots of thinking and praying to do about this.  Could be an exciting new adventure....

      Had a brief phone conversation with the she-ex yesterday.  She told me that she had fallen down the stairs and hurt her back.  She said that it feels like someone's stabbing her in the back with a knife every time she "sneezes, burps or toots".  I mentioned this conversation to my 11 year old son, just because I thought that it was humorous for her to tell me how much it hurts her to fart.  My son so wisely and quickly says to me, "You should have told her that it feels like someone's stabbing you in the back every time they take you to court!"  Well put.    What makes her think that I want to hear about her bodily functions anyway?  I'm sorry that she's hurt, but come on!  And why is she now calling me Hun?

      Hey everyone! (I'm assuming that more than one person reads this?)  All is well.  Here's the update on my life:  Today marks the end of the first week of my diet and exercise extravaganza.  I have been pop-free for seven whole days now (Goodbye Coke, my good friend), and have exersized 6 of the 7 days.  I feel great and may have lost a couple of pounds.  My goal is to lose a total of 20 lbs. by the beginning of May.  That's a ten week program and my hope is that by the end of those weeks, I will have developed some healthy habits and not slip back into eating cookies and ice cream daily.  One week down and nine to go....so far so good....wish me luck.  I started the project of removing all the wallpaper from my bathroom.  I never liked the stuff that was there when we bought it almost two years ago, but have put up with it until now.  I'm going to paint, and hopefully get some new towels and a fancy shower curtain.  I've got paint chips in all shades of brown taped to the wall so that when I sit in the tub (or on the throne) I can ponder which colour I like the best.  Hubby's not thrilled with my love for the earthy tones and I know that the brown craze has somewhat died, but unless someone gives me an exciting new alternative...Brown it will be.  I've been picking up a lot more contract jobs which are fun to do.  It feels like spring is coming.  I'm reinventing my body, my home and my attitude.  Things are good.

      Not sure if this will work...Haven't had much online luck lately.  Our computer is totally screwed.  The neighbor is going to take it to his house and erase everything for us so we can start fresh.  I don't know how long that will take, so if you need to get a hold of me, the phone is probably the best way in the next couple of weeks.

      I'm so tired of blogging only to have my post lost somewhere in cyberspace.  Stories are never as good the second time I tell them.    Friday night, the girls from the restaurant were going out.  I was invited and seriously considered going - but didn't.  I'm not sure what stopped me.  I really should have gone.  I think that I was just afraid of the unknown.  Didn't know the place, didn't know who would be there, didn't want to drink and drive, didn't want to go and not drink, didn't have anything to wear, didn't feel like getting a babysitter......I'm my own worst enemy.  I talked to one of the girls that went, and she had a great time.  I wish that I had gone with them.  I did, have a nice night though.  The kids played, I cleaned the house and actually enjoyed it.  Went to bed at midnight.  Everything is nice in my safe sheltered little world.  After we put the kids to bed on Friday, we heard the girls talking.  I stood by their door and listened in.  What I heard was so adorable.  They were having a serious conversation about whether or not Cupid was real, and exactly what his role was in getting two people to fall in love.  They decided that if Cupid just poked your heart with his arrow, that you'd be a little bit in love, But if he shot your heart and it hurt, and bled, then you'd be really, really in love!  I guess the moral of the story is that love hurts.  Glad they figured it out early.  Saturday morning, I had to work.  I had just finished telling a co-worker that I didn't expect anything for Valentines day when a delivery girl walked in with flowers, a balloon and teddy bear and asked for me.  I was very surprised.  It was very sweet.  Thanks Hon.  The bartender was apparently moved by this gift because she came over, gave me a hug and said "congratulations".  I'm not sure what she was congratulating me for - for being loved?  Whatever  Saturday night, I spent with the kids - sort of.  My daughters friend called and asked to sleep over.  I gave in, and had three screaming, giggling girls to deal with all night.  At least they had fun.  The girl's mother says to me, "You're the only couple I know that has all their kids on Valentines night!"  Hope she had a nice quiet evening with her husband.    The she-ex had planned on dropping off a Valentines present for her daughter on Saturday.  I almost had to step in and tell her that unless she had presents for all the kids, not to bother.  Luckily, she came to her senses and saved the gift for home.  She's been really nice lately.  I think Mom's been praying for her.  Thanks Mom.  It's sometimes hard for me to pray for my enemies.  Glad you've got my back.  Sunday was relaxing until I burned the steak.  I had to rescue the guinea pig from a barbie car - and by the time that was over, the steaks were black.  I thought it was funny - Hubby did not!  Never mess with a man's food!  That's the lesson I learned last night.  The $25 steak should have taken priority over the needs of the family pet.  Now I know.  My bad.

      I'll try again......Blogged three times yesterday, but it didn't go through.   I'm on the old computer which is in my son's room because a couple of days ago, the other computer died.  Sorry Chris, we were chatting at the time.  I'm not thrilled with the idea of the world wide web being in my eleven year olds bedroom, but for now - it will have to do.  I'm not sure what's wrong with the other comp.  I'm worried because all of my digital pics are stored in there.  I'd hate to lose them.  I don't know if it can be revived though.    Not much else is new with me.  I got sick of looking at my forehead yesterday and gave myself bangs.  I figure if Jennifer Aniston can do it, then it should be okay for me too.  Ha.  I'm itching for spring to come.  I feel like I need something new and fresh.  I need a new look, new clothes....I want to redecorate my house, I need a new adventure.  Working too much lately.  Yuk.  Actually, I'm heading there now.  L8r

      I asked Hubby what he wanted to do for Valentines Day and he said that it should be a great night to deliver pizzas.  Isn't marriage wonderful?!  We've got the kids that weekend anyway, so maybe I'll just find something special to do with them.    I always get the blues in February.  Maybe it's that winter has been too long.  Maybe it's the big let-down after Christmas - I don't know.  I need some sunshine!     I remember a time in my life when everyone was getting married or having babies.  I went to countless bridal and baby showers.  It seemed that someone was always celebrating something.  I miss that.  In fact, the last wedding that I went to was my own.  I wanna get all dressed up and be a part of someone's happy day.  I need something to look forward to, so hey...If you're reading this, and planning a party - invite me!  I'm bored.

      The weekend was fantastic!  Friday night was our daughters birthday party.  We went bowling and everybody had a good time.  We woke up early Saturday morning and drove up to Barrie to go snow tubing.  It was cold, but again, lots of fun.  A new experience for the kids.  We then went to our hotel where we enjoyed the indoor pool and hot tub, headed upstairs to get changed and all went out for dinner at the Keg. (another first for the kids)  Later that night, we left the kids with my brother-in-law and Hubby and I headed to the casino where we won enough money to cover the expenses of our weekend.  Monday morning, and back to reality...Hubby is laid off again - this time I'm not confident that it will only be a week or two.  I will be working all week.    Last night, though tired, I made myself stay up to watch the Superbowl and Survivor all-stars. Yes, I saw Janet Jackson's bare breast...So did the kids.  Hubby was in the kitchen and missed it.  He's very disappointed.  I don't see what the big deal is - It didn't look any different than everyone else's' breasts.  Survivor was a bit of a disappointment.  Nothing exciting happened.  It was interesting to see these people who are now celebrities expecting to be pampered though.  That's obviously not going to happen.    Hard to believe that February is already here.  Bathing suit weather will be here before you know it.  I'll start dieting after all my Valentines chocolate is gone - Yup, that's the plan.

      Christine was right.  I'm not that nice and decent person that I pretended to be.  After much thought, I've decided that my last post was BS.  I still have a lot of resentment towards the she-ex and if the truth be known, I think that I preferred it when she was trying to ruin our lives.  It just left me looking more like a saint.  My true feelings became evident yesterday.  I sat down to the computer and came across some recently accessed documents.  (I wasn't snooping...just accidentally found them)  They were pictures of the she-ex.  Apparently, Hubby had been looking at them the night before.  I had not been easy to get along with this past weekend and when I saw this yesterday morning - I flipped!  My thoughts were this....Why is he looking at pictures of his ex?  Is he re-thinking his decision?  Now that she's nice, is he re-living the past and wondering if it could have worked out?  Does he feel trapped in a relationship with me?.......    I dwelt on this all day and confronted him with it after work.  After some time, when we both calmed down, he reassured me.  He told me that he was mostly looking at pictures of his daughter when she was a baby and that yes, he was reminiscing about a family vacation that they had taken.  He was remembering what a terrible trip it had been.  He said that I had nothing to worry about.  I feel stupid.  I don't know why I let myself get so worked up like that.  Obviously, I haven't resolved my feelings about the she-ex.  I'll have to keep working on that.

      Well, my day off was not very productive.  I did some laundry, had a nap, went to McPukes and had a salad for lunch.  That's pretty much it so far.  Maybe tomorrow will be better.    I had a long talk with the he-ex tonight.  He hasn't changed a bit.  I still love the things that I loved about him and hate the things that I hated about him.  I wish that someone could get through to him.  That person is obviously not me.  I just want him to be happy - especially for the kids sake.  There is a seriously wrong role reversal when the kids are worried about and protecting the parent.  I asked him how I could help.  I didn't get an answer.    The she-ex asked Hubby to do her taxes for her.  He told her that he couldn't give her an answer without talking to me first.  When he said that, she withdrew the request.  I told Hubby that I don't mind him doing them for her as long as it's not taking away from "our time" together.  With her new pleasant attitude, I don't mind if he goes over there to paint the house or even mow the lawn as long as I know that I'm his first priority.  So, basically, I gave him my permission.  I don't think that he's going to do it though, which makes me think that I'm going to look like the bitch.  The up-side is that now, at least she knows who's boss. ;-)

      I have so many things on my mind this morning, but none of them I can blog about.  The reason is that they involve other people whom might not want their business being broadcast to the world. (Or to the three people who read my blog)    The guinea pig is starting to stink.  I wonder how you bathe those things?  I'll have to find out.  For months I've been reading a strangers blog.  It's a woman's pregnancy chronicles.  Today she will be induced.  I'll be thinking of this person who doesn't know that I exist all day.  It's funny how excited I am about this new little life - a person that I will never meet.  I feel kind of like I'm doing something wrong reading about her life each day but then again...She put it out there.  Anyway, I wish her an easy delivery and a healthy baby.  Here's the link if you want to join me in  peering  into their lives.  (What's the word I was looking for there?)   urlLink I have to push what out of where?

      So yesterday, when I got in to work, I started chatting with Val about our weekends and stuff.  We were working as we talked.  This is before 11 a.m. when the restaurant opens.  I'm right in the middle of an important story and the boss comes over, interrupts and tells me that I talk too much!  ME! - TALK TOO MUCH?????  If you know me, you know how insane that is.  I told him that I had everything ready to go and then said "Good morning Kenny!  How are you?" with the biggest fakest smile I could muster up.  As soon as he left, I finished my story...But he really pissed me off.  I do my job well.  I'm probably the only one (just because of my personality) who does not stand around the bar talking when there's work to be done.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that people come to a restaurant/bar for the atmosphere and entertainment factor.  Shouldn't staff be cheery and get along with each other?  I would bet that on the next schedule that Val and I don't have as many shifts together.  What an ass.

      Yesterday, Hubby took the whole day off!  He didn't work at all which was great because I got to spend an entire day with him.  I've taken to calling him "Stranger" lately because we barely see each other.  Anyway, it was a good day.  Last night, we were invited to go and enjoy an outdoor hottub, and we accepted.  It was Heaven!  I've never been hottubbing when there's snow on the ground before and I'd highly recommend it.  It was sooo relaxing and I woke up this morning feeling great.  My diet must be working a bit too because I wasn't as self conscious in a bathing suit as I usually am.  The scale says that I've only lost five pounds, but I think that I look better and my clothes are fitting much better too.  The biggest difference is that those saddle bags are going away.  Pilates rock!  My butt is getting higher too.  Sorry, is that too much information?  I feel good.  I think I'll go and exercise now before work.  Hellooooooo spring :-)

      Our daughters birthday party went exceptionally well!  The she-ex was kind, made eye contact and talked to me as if we were friends.  She thanked me more than once for my help (not that I did much).  Her best friend even chatted with me briefly.  The sister and her "spouse" still gave me the cold shoulder, but I'm not complaining.  There was a mystery guest at the party.  A man named Tom.  He didn't have any children with him and was helping the she-ex quite a bit.  Emily says that he's "mommys friend."  I think mommy's friend is the reason that things have been so good lately.  He even seemed like a good guy.  There is peace in the world again.  Should make my blogs less interesting though...Now I've got nobody to bitch about.   If you are within my inner circle, ask me next time you talk to me about the death threat and the kids most memorable march break moment.

      March break is winding down and my house still isn't clean.  The kids are gone to their dads/grandparents.  I had hoped that with nobody messing up, I could live in a spotless world for a week.  Not so.  I'm almost done the bathroom....time to put the door back on.  All the laundry is done and put away, but that's as far as I've gotten.    My step daughter came over last night for her visit.  She's still here (dropping her off this morning before I go to work) sleeping.  Last night she was up until 1:30 coughing.  I spoke to her mother last Friday and this past Monday about her cough, hoping that she'd take her to the doctor.  She sent her with two bottles of medicine (over the counter stuff-not prescription) and instructed Hubby to give her both which he did.  It was at this point that her cough became worse.  I read the label of one of the bottles which said not to give to a child whom has recurring cough, asthma....ect. and to see a doctor if the cough gets worse or lasts longer than a week.   urlLink Christine  suggested that the child may have asthma and I'm starting to worry that she may be right.  I'll have to talk to mom again this morning - not that she'll listen to a word that I say.  I don't want to argue with her today.  Sunday is the childs birthday party and we'll have to be polite to each other for that day, so I really hope that she doesn't go off on me today.  I'd love to tell her that smoking in the house is hurting her daughter, but to say that is just asking for trouble.  It is so hard to co-parent with someone who does everything opposite to what you're doing.  The poor kid must be confused.    Okay, off to work for me.  Gotta wash off these shamrock tattoos from yesterday.  Work sucks, but that's a whole other blog.  Wish me luck with the old hag.

      Something unusual happened this morning.  At 7:30 a.m. I heard a knock at my bedroom door.  It was my step-daughter.  She had fallen out of bed and was crying.  (Her bed is high...like 3 1/2 feet off the ground)  Hubby reached his arms out and said "come here"  to her.  She stopped, looked at us both and made a decision to come to my side of the bed.  She snuggled in with me and fell back to sleep.  I have never really felt like the two of us have bonded as much as I would like to.  I was so thankful that she chose me to comfort her this morning.  Maybe the bond is tighter than I thought.  She has been using this "falling out of bed" excuse all morning.  "Emily, drink your orange juice" ...    "I can't, my back hurts."    "Janet, I can't find my hair brush because my back hurts".   I know where she gets that from, and it's not our house.  The she-ex is still complaining from falling down the stairs.  That's why we have to do all the running around for Emily's birthday party next weekend.   I'm trying not to let this drive me crazy.  I'll attempt to concentrate on the hug that I got this morning and not hold the daughter responsible for the teaching that she's received from her mother.

      Happy Birthday Chrissy!!!!  I stole this from  urlLink her blog .  And she stole it from someone else:     You are   3%   geek     OK, so maybe you ain't a geek. You do, at least, show a bit of interest in the world around you. Either that, or you have enough of a sense of humor to pick some of the sillier answers on the test. Regardless, you're probably a pretty nifty, well-rounded person who gets along fine with people and can chat with just about anyone without fear of looking stupid or foolish or overly concerned with minutiae. God, I hate you.      urlLink Take the Polygeek Quiz at Thudfactor.com    Three percent?  That's pretty good isn't it?  That is - if being a geek is a bad thing.  As I was brushing the snow and ice off my car this morning, some idiot spun out right in front of me and hit the tree across the street.  He then backed up off the grass and curb and sped off around the corner.  Looked like he was late bringing his little brother and sister to school in Mommy's car.  I'm lucky that he went up on that curb though, because if he had gone left instead of right, I'd be in the hospital right now. Go away snow!  I'm ready for some sunshine and warmth.

       A Success Story   Good Morning.  I finally caught up on my sleep and am happy again.    Today is my ex-brother and sister in-law's tenth anniversary.  I want to say congrats to Doug and Carol for lasting ten years.  I'm reminded of my tenth anniversary and the fight that we had on that day.  I remember it oh so clearly.  I remember the long walk that I took on my own.  I found a park that I had never been to and sat in a quiet place crying and pondering the decade which had been my married life.    I hope that my former in-laws celebrate tonight.  I wish them all the best and am so proud of them for overcoming so many things together.  Nobody thought it would last.  I'm glad they proved us all wrong.

Today, I'm expecting pretty much of the same routine - except that I'll have to go out and buy guinea pig food tonight.  Blah blah blah.

      Dreams do come true, well, for some of us anyway.  One of the bartenders at work won the lottery.  I don't know her very well as she works nights and I'm on days, but as Mike said, "It couldn't happen to a nicer person." to which I answered, "It could have happened to me!".  I'm happy for her.  Single mom, works two jobs.  $250,000.00 on Encore.  Good for her.  If it's true that lightning never strikes twice in the same place, I'm definately finding a new place to work!

      We went to see Starsky and Hutch last night.  Loved it!  I am now officially a Ben Stiller fan.  You should check it out.  "DO IT, DO IT"  We also went to the casino last night and came home with more than we brought with us, so all in all, it was a good night.  Started to paint the bathroom.  The ceiling is a dark blue and I was going to leave it that way, but now that the brown paint is on the walls, I think I'm going to have to get rid of the blue all together.  I might buy the ceiling and trim paint today.    Today marks the end of the third week of my diet and exercise thing.  I've only lost about four pounds and no more than 3/4 of an inch - but, I do feel better.  I feel stronger.  I'm not giving up yet.    When I dropped off the kids to the he-ex on Friday, he told me that my hair looked like shit.  I laughed it off, telling him that I thought it looked good and that mine looks a hundred times better than his.  (Wish I could insert a pic)  Hubby tells me "I can't believe he said that to you.  What an ass!"  But he didn't say, "No, he's wrong - your hair looks good."   This perplexes me.  Did my hair look like shit that day?  If it did, then I appreciate the he-ex telling me so.  I thought that it looked good.  I really did.  Does Hubby think that it looked like shit also and just didn't want to say anything?  He's so great in that he never puts me down.  He respects my decisions and loves me for who I am - BUT....I wonder if he always tells me exactly how he feels.  Where am I going with this you ask?  I don't know for sure.  I'm just trying to figure out why I liked being told that I look like shit I guess.  Is that messed up?

      We have another unpaid meeting at work tonight.  Technically, I don't have to show, but of course, notes are taken on who comes and who doesn't.  Those who don't come to meetings quickly find their way out the door.  I don't know why they want me there anyway.  I don't want to solve the restaurants problems.  I just want to show up, do my job, get paid and go home.  I'll be there tonight though, quietly sitting in the back with a smile on my face, dreaming of the day that I get to say that I quit because something much better has come my way.  Until then, I'll keep playing my role as the reliable, loyal one.   And the Oscar goes to......

      I have fallen off the wagon.  Sunday, I had a Coke.  It was a very enjoyable five minutes until the guilt set in.  I also haven't exercised in two days.  Bad Bad BAD!!! I will go and do it now.  (sigh)  Just waiting for results is the hardest part.  The scale says I've lost a few pounds, but my clothes don't fit any better than they used to.  I wish I was 17 again and could eat whatever I wanted without worrying about it.  I used to be a hottie.  Now I just look like somebody's Mom.

      I don't know what to say today.  I've been sitting here trying to think of something happy and positive to blog about but I'm drawing a blank.  I don't want to be that person who always whines and complains about her life - but right now, that's the person I am.  I'm angry.  (One of the stages of grief?)  I'm angry at anyone who has even looked at me the wrong way lately.  The two people who are the focus of most of my negative thoughts these days are the ex's.  I could go on and on about what they've done to piss me off - but really, they are not the issue.  I remember a time when I was a kind, happy, giving, positive person.  I'd like to become that girl again.  She's in here somewhere, under a heap of painful life experiences.  She was beautiful.  I hope to see her again soon.

      I didn't get very far with the canceling the personalized plate thing.  His argument was that we've had it for years.  Why change now for that one guy.  I was too tired and weak to argue, and not sure if it's something worth arguing about.  Whatever  Work was very boring yesterday.  Three tables total.  I prefer to be busy.  Not just because of the money, but because when I'm busy...In the zone...I forget all of my physical and emotional pain for a while.  Ya do what ya gotta do.  I was cramping a lot still yesterday and had a ten minute cry in the washroom over something someone said to me.  Nobody noticed that I was gone.    Val gave me a hug and told me that she loved me, and Kevin made me a special pizza so the day wasn't a total bust.  OH....And when I got home, Hubby brought me flowers.  (I did send him to pick up a roll of film and told him that the photo place was right beside the florist...hint, hint)  I should have directed him to Hallmark for a card as well.

      We have a personalized plate on our van.  Hubby had it before I knew him and apparently, he really likes it.  The thing is, that I drive the van now most of the time and he drives my car.  I've never been one to like to draw attention to myself.  There is a guy who has a beef with my husband.  I was driving the van yesterday with my son, and met up with this guy at an intersection.  Recognizing the license plate, this guy lunges his car towards us as if he's going to hit us.  My son was scared, and I was pissed off!  I went home and filed a police report.  This is not the first time that this has happened.    I'm going to talk to Hubby again tonight about getting rid of the plate.   urlLink Christine  says it's arrogant.  I tend to agree.  I'd rather be a random number driving down the street - Not a target.

      I don't have words to express how I'm feeling today.  It is the end of a chapter in my life.  Yes, a short chapter...only about 8 weeks, but it was an important time, a turning point.  I'll be okay.  We'll go on.  I just need a few days to cry.

      The dentist said that the kids must have got their perfect teeth from me.  That's good news.  However, my son does need to see an orthodontist.  Cha ching!  I can see those dollar signs already.  The he-ex is going to have to come up with some money to help me out with this one.  I hope playing guitar in front of the grocery store is profitable this month.  I wore my camouflage pants yesterday.  My daughter said that I looked sooo good.  She said that I looked like a young mom.  Good to hear although, I think she knew that was exactly what I wanted to hear.    The she-ex smiled at me this morning.  Grandma is going to get her money back from the vacuum cleaner scam.  Dad contacted someone who in turn contacted the company and made them sweat.    I have a fun and easy job to do on the weekend.  Can't believe they actually pay people to do this stuff...And in USD too!    The sun is shining today.  It's Friday!

      Went in to work yesterday to find someone else crossed off the schedule.  Chucky got fired.  He was the best...always happy...always doing more than his share of work....a genuine fun and all round good guy.  I guess the boss ( who should have been fired himself weeks ago) raised his voice to Chuck and Chuck told him not to treat him that way.  Well, it turned in to an F-you, no F-you situation and Chucky is no more.  Another one of my favorite people there is leaving of her own accord on Friday.  That leaves Val and I working with a bunch of assholes.  I miss Chuck already.  Nobody else sings and dances in the kitchen.  Nobody else does my dishes for me.  Nobody else takes pride in their work and shows up happy everyday.  I just don't get it.  Nice management style Kenny.

      I will soon have a dishwasher installed!  Yay!  For two years it's been sitting in storage.  Alas, my favorite appliance is about to be reborn.  Yesterday I went shopping for clothes.  I am still shocked each time I pick up the size of pants that I think I wear and can not get them past my knees.    I did buy a new pair of pants yesterday.  They're camouflage!  The kids say they don't like them.  Nobody else's mom wears pants like that.  That's kinda the point.  I'm trying to recapture my youth.  Chalk it up to a pre-mid-life crisis.  The hives just won't quit.  They were so huge and red last night on my legs - I looked like I had that elephant disease.  The itchy/burning sensation is sometimes almost more than I can bear.  (Or is it bare?  Or some other spelling? - I'm drawing a blank on such a simple word)  I went to the pharmacy as suggested and asked for remedies.  As soon as I told them that I was pregnant, all they would say was, "See your doctor".   Thanks for nothing.  Back to work today.  I don't want to go.    Hubby had another boy's night out last night.  Strange.  My first tulips have bloomed in the garden!  They are so beautiful!  Tulips are my favorite flower.  Hint, hint

      When I picked up the kids last night from the he-ex (a five hour ordeal) he was proudly wearing a T-shirt that said:   I'VE GOT NO JOB.  I'VE GOT NO CAR.  I'VE GOT NO MONEY.  I'M IN A BAND.  Funny and absolutely true.  I've come to the breaking point.    It's time to take action.  I need some child support.  I can't spend eight hours a month driving the kids back and forth to see their dad on my dime.  Hubby has been very patient.  He's right.  If I continue to allow the he-ex to take advantage of me, it will go on forever.  Nobody else will stand up to him.  It's time I did.    I'm not the bitter ex-wife who wants to make him pay for his mistakes.  I'm not out to ruin his life.  I just want him to take some responsibility for his kids and to help me out a bit financially.  I know that by taking some action that I might be declaring war against his entire family.  Wish they wouldn't see it that way, but it's inevitable.    Ya know what Rob?  Grow up!  Be a man!  Take some responsibility for your actions!  Stop living off of everybody else!  Do something with your life!  Please, Please, Please Be an example for your children.  Earn some respect.    AAAAAHHHH......Deep breath......I'm done.

      Grandma got scammed again.  The same vacuum cleaner people that talked her into buying an expensive machine a few years ago have struck again.  They came to "maintain" the machine as she had bought an extended warranty and left with her Visa authorization for over $1100.00.  Crooks!  They left phony contact numbers and not much else to go on.  The woman is 84 years old, can not walk and only has one room in her house with carpet.  My family is outraged!  I hope these people get what they deserve.

      Last night, my cell phone rang.  Very few people know the number.  When I answered, the person on the other end asked for Rob.  (The he-ex's name)  "Wrong number" I said and the person hung up.    I talked to the he-ex last night and told him about the mysterious call.  He says to me "Yeah, something's going on.  Somebody's been messing in our business."  and told me not to give out his phone number to anyone.    I have no idea what he's talking about and why anyone would want to  mess in our business .  Why did he say  our  business and not  my  business?   The only business that  we  have is that we have children together.  If someone is messing in that business, then I should know about it.    He didn't go into further detail.  There is always drama surrounding his life - whether real or imagined.  Although a big part of me is relieved that I'm not involved any longer in all those ups and downs, a small part of me is curious.  What  is  going on?  Is someone after him?  Is it the government?  The thought police?  Big Brother?    What excitement a wrong number can cause!

      We took the girls to McDonalds last night.  They got my order wrong twice.   It's okay, though 'cause I didn't really feel like eating anyway.  In the middle of dinner (if you could call it that) my step-daughter blurts out, "Mommy says that Janet never brushes my hair!"  Hubby stepped up and explained that "It's not Janet's responsibility to brush your hair.  You're a big girl, you need to brush your own hair."  Emily repeated her complaint.  "But Mommy says...Janet never brushes my hair!"  I have to admit, Hubby's response was much more adult-like than mine was because I replied, "I don't wipe your bum either!"  I'm sorry, but I have three kids to look after.  I don't have the luxury of treating any of them like my own personal dress up dolly.  I make sure that they are all dressed, teeth and hair brushed before they go out - but I make them do it themselves.  They are old enough.    I also remember the she-ex screaming at me at a soccer game to never touch her child's hair again!  That being said, I do regularly check the girls head for lice.  I hope that at dinner tonight with her mom, Emily repeats my bum wiping comment as she is dipping her hair in ketchup.

      Hubby means well, He tries hard, He just doesn't get it.    In the last eight months, I have had hives frequently.  My skin swells up into these red itchy bumps.  It's ugly and uncomfortable.  The doctor says that it's an allergic reaction to something.  We just don't know what.  In the last few weeks, the hives have become worse.  It seems that when the she-ex was pregnant, she was itchy all the time.  In fact, just before I was afflicted with these hives, I remember referring to her as the "itchy bitchy".  I think that I'm paying for that comment now.    Hubby keeps telling me to put lotion or powder on my skin.  This doesn't help.  He just doesn't get it that his solution to my problem is not a solution at all.  In fact, he doesn't hear me when I tell him that lotion and powder does not work.  Yesterday, he dropped off his daughter at home and returned with a can of Gold Bond powder.  He took it upon himself to  help  and asked the she-ex if he could have the  magic powder , explaining to her that I, like her, am also itchy.    I doubt very much that we are/were suffering from the same thing, and did not want her used, crusty topped can of powder in my house.  She does not need to know my medical issues, and I certainly don't need any advise from her on how to carry my husband's child.  I will return the offending powder at the next child exchange.  Hubby, in his blissful ignorance, was just trying to help.  I love ya babe, but from now on...If I need your help, I'll ask for it.   Thank-you.

      You may remember that eight weeks ago, I put myself on a diet and exercise plan.  I was just beginning to see and feel the results when I found out that I was pregnant.  Now, after two weeks of doing pretty much nothing, I feel like I'm back to the beginning.  I've got two weeks left of my ten week program and have decided to start up again.  I am still generally making healthier food choices, but have relaxed quite a bit.  All the Easter chocolate temptations are not helping.  I'm struggling with the thought that striving for a lean, thin body is kind of pointless right now - but then again, there's nothing wrong with being healthy.  I've got the before pictures. (they are pretty disgusting)  I hope the after pictures will be better.

      Yesterday, the family got together.  We were celebrating Dad and Ashleighs birthdays.  Also, being the Easter weekend, we brought home a garbage bag full of chocolate for the kids.  Grandma once again gave the gift of Avon.  My cousin arrived from Calgary yesterday and will be staying for a while at my parents place.  We haven't seen her in about 15 years.  I remember her as a child.  She's all grown up now - making me feel old.  I went, prepared not to like her.  She's a model and therefore, I kinda expected her to be stuck up.  She was not.  In fact, she's not only beautiful, but also very sweet.  I hope to get to spend some more time with her.    Dinner was amazing.  Mom went all out, and there was tones to eat.  The he-ex showed up for a few minutes and brought gifts for the kids.  It was a bit awkward, making Hubby feel uncomfortable.  He left before dinner and things returned to normal.  Then there were the whispers about a baby.  Not an outright announcement - just a quiet acknowledgement.  Our family will be growing this year.    All in all, it was a good day.  A little bit of everything.  The only thing we were missing was an engagement.  I'm sorry Phil - I'm trying to back off.  I just couldn't help it.

      The sweetness of chocolate can counteract the bitterness of daily life.  That's how I feel today, and so, that's why I went in to the bag that was hidden in the closet and devoured half a Turtles chocolate egg.  MMMmmmm.  The Easter bunny will have to go back to Walmart tomorrow.  Although, nothing else has changed in my life since I woke up this morning, that chocolate made me feel so much better.

      We spent the afternoon at the school talent show today.  One of our three kids were performing.  Randy brought in his complete drum kit and instantly became the coolest kid in school.  He did really well, backing up the choir on drums for four songs and playing bongos for one kid who did a rap song.  The music teacher asked me this question:  What's the difference between a musician and a savings bond?  The answer is that a savings bond matures!  I'm proud of my son's musical talent but hope that he doesn't put all his eggs in one basket.  Take it from me, A 30 year old wanna-be rock star is not a great provider for a family.  But as an 11 year old, it's a worthwhile dream.  One thing I can tell you is that on the popular-o-meter, his arrow right now is pointing to ten!  I'm afraid I'll start to see female groupies hanging around soon.

      Okay, so no firing yesterday, although the owners  were  in the restaurant.  We got a little bit busy, and my manager put on an excellent performance.  He took orders for me, brought out food, even printed up bills - all with a smile on his face.  He was so incredibly helpful and when I tried to tip him out, he wouldn't take the money, saying "We are a team."  Now  that's  the kind of manager that I'd like to see everyday!    So, I feel guilty for yesterdays post and all the times that I've been waiting for the ax to fall on his neck.  Although, maybe I'm suffering from a kind of battered wife syndrome where I take all kinds of abuse and then he comes back with flowers and sweetness and all is forgotten and forgiven.    One of the regulars at the bar tricked me into buying him a beer!  I'm such a sucker!  There's such a fine line where my best qualities can turn into my worst qualities.  I'm trusting and forgiving, but sometimes, I become a doormat.  C'est la vie!

      Rumor had it that my boss (manager) was to be fired on April 1st.  It was then pushed back to yesterday.  Didn't happen.  Might happen today, or maybe not at all.  My source tells me that some other people are going too.  People that I'm might miss.  Maybe  I'm  getting fired?  Can't say that I'd be all that disappointed, although the last time I was fired was from a babysitting job, and I didn't have to put that on my resume.  I hate all this instability at work.  I think the owners have too much money and not enough brains.  Anyway, we'll see what drama today holds.  Last night I went to a mother-daughter banquet at the church.  Kianna got her badges for all the work she's been doing and remembered her Easter lines perfectly when she was up on stage.  It was nice to spend the time together just her and I.    There's some other stuff going on in my bland little life, but I can't post it until next week.  How's that for a teaser?

      I woke up this morning and opened the blinds.  What did I see?  A blanket of white on everything and little white flakes falling from the sky.  When we set the clocks ahead last night, I fully expected to wake up to a beautiful spring day.  I was wrong.  I will have to stay indoors today and clean my house - like I was supposed to yesterday.  Ugh

      I had a dream last night.  I was losing my teeth.  I have heard that this particular dream has a specific meaning, so this morning I did some internet research and here are two explainations that I found:  This classic dream has a number of interpretations.  It can literally mean that you are frightened of losing your teeth.  It can show the beginning of a new phase of life just as we lose our teeth when we pass from early childhood and head towards adulthood.  You may be worried about your self image or the dream may signify unexpressed anxiety.    Loss of control over certain aspects of one's life.  Powerlessness, unable to influence things or the outcome of things important.  Loss of self esteem in a situation or chronic problem.  Both explainations sound pretty bleak, but may each hold some truth.  It was a strange dream.  I seemed to be back in school (a reccuring theme in my recent dreams) and I think that I was married to Paul Williams of the Y&R!  My teeth turned black like sharks teeth after they fell out.  That's about all I remember.  If the tooth fairy was real, I'd be up about ten bucks.

      A thought just crossed my mind.  Have you heard men criticizing women saying that they judge a man by the car he drives?  I have heard that too many times.  I don't think it's generally true.  Sure we don't want to drive around in a beater, but most women I know aren't that shallow.  I think that  men  judge other men by the cars they drive.    I remember when I introduced my husband to my brother.  I later asked my brother what he thought of my new man.  My brother answered, "He's got a nice van!"  I recently commented to Hubby that the she-ex's new boyfriend seemed like a nice guy.  Hubby replied, "Well, he drives a really nice car."  Don't blame us guys, saying that we are judging you on the wrong things.  You're doing it yourself.  When someone asks me "What do you think of so and so?", you're not going to hear me say "Well, she has a really nice rack!"  Sorry, I know you'd love to hear that - but you're not gunna

      My boss is suddenly my new best friend.  What's up with that?  He looks me in the eye, tells jokes and even listens when I speak.  Val says that he's trying to divide and concore because her and I are so close.  His evil plan will not work, but you can bet that I will take advantage of his new great attitude towards me.  Little does he know that the clock is winding down.  His time here will soon be up.  It's kinda sad really.  As much as I dislike him, and feel that he doesn't know how to do his job, he's not a bad guy.  I just hate to see anyone blindsighted like that.  In a few days, he will get the news that he's fired.  It will be a shock to him and most of the staff.  Lucky me...I have a connection.  I've known for a while.  Spring is here.  Changes are happening.  More news to come....

      Well, the kids say that they had a good weekend.  Forgot their clothes at the girlfriends house though.  I doubt I'll ever see them again.  I asked if she'd wash them for us and was told that she washes her clothes in the kitchen sink by hand.  This is why I always send them in their crap clothes.    After yelling and swearing at me for being late, the he-ex handed me a roll of quarters on Friday night.  I'm not sure if the ten bucks was supposed to be for gas or for child support.  Ha - either way, it's not near enough.  I put 32 bucks in the tank on Friday before I dropped the kids off and put 35 in last night after I picked them up.  Our son needs a new pair of shoes.  I just gave our daughter ten bucks for a school field trip.    Gee Rob, thanks for the change.  The masking tape that you used to hold the quarters together didn't work so good.  It came apart in my purse.  But that's okay.  I know you're trying.  It was only ten years of marriage and two kids.  BTW, the ten bucks you gave me...I'm giving it to the heart and stroke foundation.  I'd get a receipt in your name for a tax break - but you don't pay taxes do you?  Ah well.  Thanks for your thoughtfulness.  I'm sorry I screwed you by showing up late with the kids.  Hope you can forgive me.

      Another Friday and I'm faced with the same dilemma that I deal with twice a month.  I must bring the kids to see their father for the weekend.  That in itself is not the problem.  It's the location that bothers me.  This weekend he doesn't plan to go up to his parents farm with the kids.  He wants to stay at his girlfriends house in Hamilton.  She's having surgery on her teeth and he fears that she will not be able to take care of herself or her own children this weekend - therefore he will not leave her.    My children fear this woman.  I don't think that the fact that she will be in pain this weekend and doped up on medication is going to help.  It may make her more irritable and I don't want her taking it out on the kids or on the he-ex in front of the kids.  The he-ex asked me to trust him and not to worry.  I know that he would never intentionally put the kids in danger....But I worry.  The girlfriend has kicked them out (with no place to go) more than once.  The he-ex has no home, no car, no job.  Just a few friends who are slightly better off than he is.  I don't want the kids to be homeless - even for a day.  I want them to be secure and safe.  I wish that I felt confident that they will be.  Why don't I refuse to bring them there you ask?  Many reasons.  We have joint custody.  I feel that it is important for the kids to have a relationship with their father and spend time with him.  I know that he loves them more than anything.  I don't want to start a war with the he-ex.  He would put the kids in the middle telling them that I was taking them away from him.  I want to see the good and believe the best in people.  I just want what's best for the kids.  Any thoughts?  I'm too close to this situation to see clearly.  What is the right thing to do?  I welcome your comments.

      On Monday night (as I previously mentioned) we went to the fair.  We brought our 13 year old next door neighbor with us.  As we were walking through the mud and pushing through hoards of people, she looks over at me and says, "You're so so pretty!  You are beautiful!  I want to be you!"  As much as I enjoyed the compliment, I couldn't help but think that this sweet child must be crazy.  Why anyone would want to be me...I don't know.  I have a great family, a good life..But it hasn't been an easy one.  I felt this heaviness in my heart - this great responsibility to be a role model for the girl.  Then the fear hit me.  What happens when she finds out that I'm far from perfect?    I wonder what qualities she sees in me that she admires.  Her comments made me think of my own children.  They made me realize that my every word, every action may affect someone else's life, and I would never know it.  These are truths that I had known before, that I had been taught.  I had just forgotten them.  Thanks D for the reminder and the compliments.  I'll try not to disappoint you, although I'm afraid it's inevitable.

      When I went in to work yesterday, the weather outside was beautiful!  It was sunny and hot.  I had high hopes of only being at work for a couple of hours and then getting sent home.  This is what I truly believed in my heart.  I had faith that I'd get to spend the afternoon with my family.  The good news is that I made $170.00 in tips.  The bad news is that nobody else showed up to work.  I was hostess/server/bartender.  I worked from 11 to 7 without a bathroom break or a bite to eat.  The new guy helped me out, but the restaurant was busy and I hadn't worked behind the bar before. I came home exhausted, hungry and reeking of beer.  Then we went out to the fair and to see fireworks.    What a great long weekend! The kids had a blast!  We were all up late every night though and it showed this morning.  Tired, cranky people off to work and school.  I might be the crankiest of them all.  We ran out of milk.  (Chocolate milk in the morning to me is like coffee to many others...gotta have it)  I'm drinking cranberry juice for breakfast.  Yuk

      I had today off.  I did!  What is wrong with me?  I picked up a shift for today.  One of the girls came to me and said that she had booked today off but was asked to work anyway.  She was one of the first ones to book it off  (everybody's name was in the book - including mine).  I felt bad that I put my name in after hers and was granted the day off so I offered to work for her.  It's almost 9:30 and everyone is still asleep.  It's nice and quiet here except for the sound of my brother-in-law snoring.    E has soccer practice tonight.  K has a game tomorrow.  K and R have practice on Wednesday night (when E comes to visit) and E has a game on Thursday.  No word yet on what night R's games will be.  3 kids in soccer.  This is what our lives will look like from now until the end of the summer.  What have we gotten ourselves into?

      I am now a soccer mom.  My two started soccer last night.  Both are very excited about it.  Neither had played on a team before which I could tell made the coaches nervous - but I was told that they did much better than expected.  We're still waiting to hear when the third child starts.  It's always suspicious when the she-ex tells us "I don't know".  It usually means, "I know a lot but refuse to tell you because I love to play games and control your lives".  Or at least, that's my interpretation.  I cleaned the dining room yesterday at work from top to bottom.  I like to stay busy and may have even done it on my own, but I resent being asked to do it.  Why should they pay a cleaner to come in each night ( she does a crappy job anyway ) when I will clean for $6.20/hr.?  I was hired as a server - not a cleaner!  I am paid the wage of someone who gets tips.  If they want me to clean, I think that they should pay me more!  The owners and manager had a meeting yesterday.  I served them.  I hate doing that!!!!  I always feel as though I'm interrupting when I go to the table and yet if I leave them alone, then they don't get the service that they expect.  I got the evil eye from one of the owners as I was clearing his table.  I think he was afraid that I was reading his top-secret documents that he had out on the table.  Give me a break!  I've been there for almost two years and the man called me Trish yesterday!  It's so good to be respected and appreciated in the workplace.    The truth is that I really don't want to work at all.  Wish I didn't have to.  It irks me to no end that I am working five days a week while the she-ex sits on her ass and collects spousal support!  That's my real problem.  The previous two paragraphs are just my excuses why I shouldn't be working.  I'll admit to my own BS.

      Wednesday.  Just a few more days to go until the weekend.  I'm exhausted!  Hubby's on afternoons this week and so if I want to see him, I have to wait until he gets home at midnight.  Then we have the usual  married couple conversation  about the kids, the bills, work, what we had for dinner and if there is any leftovers...  Work sucks.  Everybody talks behind everybody's back.  What a bunch of two faced phonies.  The conversations I overheard yesterday were shocking.  I don't know why I expected more of a crowd who has to down 4 pints each every morning before noon.  They don't care who serves it to them.    The power was out yesterday at work until about one o'clock.  We had to turn away people who wanted to eat.  The new guy should have sent me home - but no...He made me clean and restock everything.  He also wants me to continually wipe all the tables in the dining room.  I mean continually!  When I'm done wiping them, I've got to start over and wipe them all again.  It appears that the new assistant is too good for that kind of work.  She'd prefer to stand around thinking up new things for me to do and making sure that I do them right.  You earn respect honey.  Just because your title is assistant doesn't mean that you're better than me.   So I'm off to wipe tables.  There will be no standing around socializing for me today.  Can't trust anyone anyway.  I'll just quietly put in my time, keep a smile on my face and hope to be called into the office for my lay off notice.  I'd love to have the summer off!  Ahh   Wouldn't that be nice?

      I was just looking at my yearbooks from high school.  (A teacher was on the news and I recognized his name..wasn't in the yearbook...maybe I know it from when I worked at the Board of Ed.)  Anyway, I was reading all the signatures and little poems that people put on the pages.  It's amazing how many people wrote on there "friends forever" and I haven't seen or heard from them since the last day of school.    I wonder what they're doing now?  I wonder what I wrote in their books?  I wonder what they remember about me and if I've changed much since then.    Here are some of the less mushy bits and pieces that I found on the pages of my yearbooks:  Looking forward to going boy chasing with you this summer!  Get a great tan!!   - Jennifer '85  Too bad you missed Jack Wagner.  Oh well, Bryan Adams and Don Henley are coming this summer.  I'm sure they'll be just as good.  Have a great summer!   - Steve '85  Christine was here but now she's gone.  She left her name to carry on.  Those who loved her, loved her well.  Those who didn't can go to hell.  '85  I was here but now I'm gone.  I left my name to turn you on. -Andrew '85  Life is an illusion caused by lack of alcohol.  - Sue '86  Ebony and Ivory. - Rita '86  If Mr. Grant is teaching math next year we can make assassination plans! - Heather '86  Janet, Play hard to get.  I have spoken.  Are you going to marry him?  Probably not.  - Dan '87  Roses are red, Shamrocks are green, I like your leg and the rest is obscene.  - Todd '87  Roses are pink, Violets are pink, everything is pink after your 16th drink - Amy '87  Ditch the hair spray!  - Susan '87  You cute girl on page 39, Have a great summer and a party of a life. - Chris '87  Teachers are like diapers.  They're always on your ass and full of shit. - Kiran '87  Keep it hanging - Shama '87  Party till you drop - Dennis '88  You can get it.  One can never aim to high. Love beats everything. - Charlie '88  Little Jack Horner sat in a corner because he had a square bum. - Dawne Marie - '88  And finally...  20 years from now you'll read this and wonder who the hell I am!  It's been real.  Chow babe - Mike '88  I remember you Mike.  You had the locker next to mine and you played tight end for the football team.  I thought you made up that position "tight end".  ( You were a rather large boy )  I'm sorry for laughing.

      Title as promised.  That's what Grandma said when she saw her freshly painted kitchen cupboards.  She loved the new tablecloth too.  We spent a long tiring day yesterday at Grandma's house cleaning out her kitchen and painting everything.  What a huge job!  The rest of my family put in two full days of work there and there is still much more work to do.  It looks good though, and I'm very happy to have been able to help.    Back to work today.  Ugh.  Need more sleep.  Val was fired. (they were actually kind enough to lay her off) The gradual changes in the restaurant are not so gradual.  The new guy has hired a bunch of people including a bartender/assistant manager.  I want to quit so bad.  Wish I could.  Everybody there is stressed and fed up.  Everybody  wants  to quit!    It will be interesting to see if we actually lose our regulars.  Many of them said that they wouldn't come back if Val was fired.  They had even started a petition to keep her.  I'm going to try to get my resume together this week.  I may need it soon.    The weekend was good.  I'm exhausted and can't wait until the next weekend.  It's a long one for most people!  Hope I'm one of them.

      I have stories to tell from work yesterday...But I'm sick of talking about that place - for now.  Today's my day off.  Finally!  Last night, I dropped my kids off in Hamilton to their dad.  When I arrived, his girlfriend was not there, so he invited me to sit for a while which I did.  We sat on the polluted porch for a while chatting casually while watching the bums, the police cars, ambulances and hookers go by.  One guy stopped to preach at us about how Jesus could change our lives.  The he-ex was surprisingly mellow with this guy.  Usually he'd jump right into a long "theological" conversation.  His glassy eyes told me that he was high and just couldn't be bothered at the time.  Then the girlfriend came home with a pizza.  She walked right by me.  I smiled and said hi but she ignored me.  "What'd I do?"  I asked the he-ex.  He called her a bitch and told me that she was jealous of my boobs.  The girlfriend brought out two plates of food for the he-ex without looking at me or saying a word.  I really wanted to start something with her.  I had a hundred sarcastic comments on the tip of my tongue but I refrained because of the kids.    Finally my former father-in-law arrived to pick up the he-ex and the kids for the weekend.  Seeing me from the back, he cheerfully said, "Hi Shannon ( the girlfriends name )  How are you?"  I turned around and smiled at him.  "Oh you're not Shannon!" he said and then looked at the ground.  The man can't even look at me!  When I phone his house he pretends that he's never heard my name before!  "No, I'm Janet" I answered, "I'm fine.  Thanks for asking."    It's hard to leave my two most precious little souls with these people sometimes.

      The new manager seems okay.  He's been observing for the last few days.  He asked me how I felt about my job.  I told him that I'd like to stay.  "That's more up to you than it is me" he said.  Good text book answer.    I think he's straight.  Val said she saw him check her out.  I don't know.  Just 'cause a guy's 40 and single doesn't make him gay.    Word is that he has a chip on his shoulder.  Whatever that means.  Must be hard to be the new guy!  I don't envy him.  Actually, that's one reason that I don't want to find another job.  I don't like being the "new guy."  He told me that there would be changes but that they'd be gradual.    So, I'm on my fifth day straight of work!  Part time ends up feeling like full time when you go every day - even if it is only for 4-5 hours each day.  Can't get anything done at home.    How do you get rid of dandelions?  I should ask my neighbors.  Their lawns are perfect.

      The word is...That our new manager will be here today.  The poor guy doesn't have a clue what he's getting himself into.  Unless he has a magic wand and works some kinda magic...It's just a matter of time before the place goes under.  I also hear whispers that he could be gay.  Not that this bothers me, but I don't think the guys at the bar are going to go so easy on him if he is. Helloooo  It's a sports bar!   Finally, I heard yesterday that the one owner who is planning on cleaning house and firing everyone thinks that I'm a good server and a hard worker - which I am.  I may just keep my job yet.....The question is...Do I want it?  After all that's happened, seeing people betrayed, bad decisions being made...My heart's not in it.  My work ethic is slipping.  The good thing is that if I stay, I don't have to worry about looking for something else.  I do hate change sometimes.  I'm comfortable where I am.  Horrible in an interview. I'm going to take it day by day.    I'll be on time this morning.  I'll do the little bit extra that I used to do.  I'll try to get a feel for the new guy...See where the place is heading.  At best, they'll lay me off and I can collect UI.  Who knows?

      Well, the ten pounds that I lost have crept back on somehow.  (I say that like I don't remember eating all those cookies)  About 12 weeks ago - I put myself on a 10 week diet and exercise plan.  Things were going well and I had lost ten pounds when I found out that I was pregnant.  Suddenly..Working on a body fit for a bikini seemed pointless.  I pretty much stopped exercising and somewhere along the way began eating junk again.  Now the warm weather is here (to stay for a while I hope) and I can not hide under giant sweaters and jackets any longer.  So - like other things in my life right now....I'm starting over.  We'll see which happens first - Get skinny or get pregnant again?  And what am I going to do about a job?  Will I be fired?  Will I quit?  Will I find something else that gives me the hours that I want?  Will that money tree finally grow in my back yard?  I might get a new hairstyle too.  Ya never know.

      The weekend was fun.  I took the kids and my brother-in-law bowling, then we went home and watched School of Rock...which was funny because it reminded me alot of my ex.  He's still trying to  stick it to the man .  We also played a game together and made chocolate chip cookies and rice crispy squares - the kids and I.   Sunday (Mothers day) I had a job to do in Niagara Falls so we all went out for breakfast there.  I did my job, then we went go-karting and mini-putting.  It was fun to spend time with the kids like that.  I got lots of home made cards and some beautiful yellow tulips (hubby finally read my blogs)  It was a great weekend.  I only regret not being able to spend time with my Mom and Grandmother on Mother's Day.    Today the sun was shining and the breeze was warm.  It's a smiley kind of day today.  I even made decent money at work today in tips.  Life is good.

       urlLink Christine  last night, thinking that I was a  real person  (read her Monday blog) called me during Friends.  I am sad to see them go.  I loved that show!  I liked the way they ended it.  Much better than Seinfeld's ending where they all went to jail.  Sorry to disappoint ya Chrissy.  I spend much more time in front of the TV than I do turning the pages of a book.  Sad but true.             When Fathers Day comes around, my kids always bring two cards home from school.  One for Hubby and one for their Dad.  I just picked up all three kids at school.  Two of them have Mothers Day cards for me.  My step-daughter had two cards that she asked me to hold.  "They're for my mom"  she said.  This doesn't hurt as much as you might think.  I didn't really expect her to think of me and so, I'm not disappointed.  I'm just glad and proud of the fact that my kids are thoughtful and conscious of the feelings of others.   Don't get me wrong...Emily's a good kid.  She just learned from her mom to look out for number one.  And she doesn't realize that at our house - She's not the boss.  That'd be ME.

      Okay, so here's the drama at work.....  The manager must have heard the rumours that he's getting fired and decided to bail first.  He's given his two weeks notice.    Two of the three owners voted to fire Val.  She will be gone in another week.  In fact, these owners want to get rid of everybody except for three people.  I am not one of them.    Before I knew all this, I was asked to work extra shifts for the next couple of weeks to help out.  Now I know that I'll be training my replacement!  Ha!    I think they hired Malibu Barbie.  She doesn't have her smart serve, but she does have perfect hair and a great sense of style.  Too bad she'll have to wear the same ugly uniform that the rest of us wear.  Some of the regulars have started a petition to keep Val working there.  They have also vowed not to come back if she's fired.    I worked more than eight hours yesterday ( left work at 7 p.m.) and made $87 in tips...Which is good for where I work, but is what I used to make in a four hour shift at my former place of employment.    I'm thinking about giving my two weeks notice.  I figure that if they're going to fire me anyway, why stick around?  But then...I can't get unemployment if I quit.  Hmmm...It's a problem  There is a new guy in the kitchen who is so optimistic about his new job.  It's so sad because he's a nice guy and is really working hard.  He reminds me of Bambi just before he met Godzilla.    I will continue to give my customers excellent service.  I will not however do anything extra for the restaurant.  I'm not cleaning.  I'm taking all my breaks.  A good work ethic is obviously not rewarded there.  I don't know what they want.  The place is going under.

      I'm good.  I'm turning into my old self again and it feels good.  I've made a decision to stop feeling like a bag of crap.  You are not responsible for my happiness.  I'm sorry if I put that on you.  It's a new day.  It's May.  Let's rock!  The kids didn't realise that I broke a promise.  Everything worked out alright.  I went to pick them up prepared to kick some skinny ass, but it wasn't necessary.  I'm glad to have them back and it will be a full two weeks before I have to deal with this particular issue again.    Today is a big day.  It's my parents 35th wedding anniversary, my brother-in-law's 31st birthday and also the two year anniversary of us owning our house.  I'm going to celebrate by going to work and serving poor quality sandwiches and coffee to the few brave souls who dare to come in.  They will have great service though.  Come on...Tip me....Tip me big!

      It has been a stressful weekend so far, but today is a new day.  I've been able to say all the things that I needed to say and I feel better.  Thank you to those who have supported me.  I love you.  The child exchange with the he-ex was very stressful this weekend.  I made a promise to my children....One I was not able to keep.  I will find out tonight when I pick them up if they took it as hard as I did.    BTW....Try the Buffalo Chicken Pizza at Pizza Hut.  MMmmm.  Yummy

      Just because I haven't complained about them lately doesn't mean that I'm no longer afflicted.  Here's a list of things that make me red, bumpy, itchy, uncomfortable and ugly:   Stress  The sound of the he-ex's voice The mention of the she-ex's name Not being able to find anything to wear Being late for work (or other important activities like lunch with friends)   Physical Causes  Elastic and tight clothing Sun Heat Ragweed Any pressure put on my skin for more that a couple of minutes Advil and other drugs Over exhersion (wrong spelling?  You know what I mean)   Possible Causes  Ranch dressing Cheese Tomatoes Chocolate and coke (These things I  will  suffer for) Hair conditioner Mascara and other makeup Gold?  I'm getting used to the annoyance.  Excuse me while I go change into my pj's....

      I have to admit...I didn't vote today.  I thought about it.  I even put on my shoes to go and do it - but ended up just walking to the mailbox instead.  I hadn't decided who to vote for anyway.  I would have had to make up my mind at the ballot box.  I was watching something on TV a few weeks ago.  It was some kind of reverse psychology campain called Screw the Vote.  They were handing out T-shirts and buttons that said Screw the Vote...Let others decide your future.  I wish I had more options.  I'm not happy with any of the candidates or their policies and thus, No vote.  I wonder who won?  I guess I'll go and turn on the TV and find out.

      When I asked on Thursday for ideas of what to do on the weekend, I got an overwhelming response.  Not from readers...But from Hubby.  It seems that since he is working all weekend - He has a list of things that  he  would normally do on the weekend that he has transferred to me.  For example..."Could you go out to the backyard first thing in the morning and water the plants?" No.  By the time I get up, dressed and out the door the sun will be shining bright and it will no longer be the morning hour.   Last night while snacking on the couch..Me:"oops  looks like I dropped something"  him:"That's okay...You'll be vacuuming tomorrow."    Here's the best one...Him: "Why don't you marinate the steak tomorrow?" me: "I didn't know that we had steak" him: "Just go up the hill to that place that we go and get some.  You could surprise me." me: "You want me to go to a specific store and buy two steaks, come home, marinate them, cook them and serve them to you as a surprise?" him:  "No, You'd better buy three.  That way I'll have something for my lunch." me:  "Okay, so I'm going to the specific store, buying three steaks, marinating them, cooking them...on the BBQ, and serving them to you.  What would you like with them?" him:  "Potatoes and broccoli and garlic bread...Just surprise me." me: "Surprise..I'm taking you to the Keg!  They've got good steak" him: *laughs* "Just don't burn the steak"  I guess the surprise would be if I actually did what he asked.  Ha!  We're having roast beef tonight.  Surprise!

      As I was leaving work yesterday, I witnessed a kid fall off of his bike and wreck his knee and his front tire.  I went over to ask him if he was okay and was going to suggest going in to the restaurant where he could clean himself up.  The kid asks me, "Can I get a ride home?"  This took me aback for a second.  You don't ask for rides from strangers these days!  "Uhh..sure", I said.  I loaded his bike in the van and drove the kid home.  He lived fairly close to my place.  He didn't look at me.  He mumbled "thanks" as he got out of the van and I drove away.    I tried talking to him on the short drive.  He'd answer me in short one word answers.  I'm not good at that kind of thing (starting up conversation with a stranger) so I just drove in silence.  It's so weird because if this had happened a few years earlier, I'd have probably offered this kid a ride home without him having to ask.  I feel bad that I didn't even think of it and that I was shocked when he asked me.    Was it because it was an inconvenience to me?  Am I that much of a selfish bitch?  Is it just the way the world is these days...That you can't trust anyone?  Sad.  I found myself glancing at my purse on the floor of the van and wishing that I had closed it.  What's wrong with me that I've lost the instinct to help a person in need?  In the end, I did what was right but am disappointed with myself that it wasn't my first natural instinct.  What impact did I have on this kids life?  Probably none.  But he made me examine myself.  Hopefully next time I won't think twice about helping a person in need.

      Well, the kids are with the he-ex.  Dropped them off last night.  More unbelievable drama, but I'm too exhausted trying to please everybody that I just don't want to get into it again.  So anyway, The kids are away till Sunday night.  Hubby's working overtime on both Saturday and Sunday which will give me the weekend pretty much to myself.  Ahhh  Quiet time!  What to do with it?  Any ideas?

      The kids stayed up late last night and are still sleeping now.  I even got to sleep in a little bit this morning as I didn't have to get them ready for school.  Unfortunately, I do have to go to work today.  I will be paying a sitter.  Come on big tippers!  Come and see me today!  I'll serve your sandwiches with a smile.  Eat quickly, tip largely and get the hell out so that I can go home.  Oh...And please sit on the patio so that I can catch a few rays while I work and then sweep all the crumbs directly onto the ground.  Thanks.  :-)  Come again.

      Today is the last day for the free babysitting that we call the education system.  What to do with the kids tomorrow?  I still don't know.  I have called in the he-ex on this one but don't expect him to actually get back to me until he's damn good and ready.  K has been invited to two birthday parties.  One tomorrow and one the next day - both while I'm at work.  She's upset with me because I told her that I couldn't take her.  Even if I could, I doubt that I'll make enough $ in tips today to buy two birthday presents...And what about paying a sitter?  Why am I working again?    Hubby was in the doghouse bigtime yesterday.  Thought I might see flowers when I got home - But no.  That must have been a movie I watched.    I think it's great that my family still accepts the he-ex and treats him well.  I think it's great that he's comfortable with them again.  I don't think it's cool that my Dad paid him to cut down a tree (when I get NO child support), or that they all went out for dinner last night.  I don't think it's cool for the he-ex to be hitting on my cousin.  But hey...That's just me.  When I divorced him, his family made it clear that I was no longer welcome at their homes or dinner tables.  (Doug as the exception)  I guess my family took the high road.  Really, I'm glad they did.  Good for them.  It's just all so weird.

      We turned off the air last night and opened the windows to get the cool breeze.  I woke up this morning to the smell of fire.  Once I determined that none of our neighbor's houses were burning, I was able to lay there and enjoy the smells of summer.  It was like a camp fire smell...Something you don't get much here in the city.  It reminded me of the many summers that I spent up north as a child and some of the country living that I did as an adult.  It's a comforting smell...A relaxing smell.  It still lingers, now mixed with the odor of the eggs that Hubby cooked for breakfast.  Makes me almost want to go camping....But then again, why would I want to do that when I can relax in my comfortable bed, close my eyes, take a deep breath and imagine that I'm outdoors surrounded by trees and steps away from a lake?  Ahhh...The lazy days of summer are here!  I've been waiting a long time for this.

      Last night I volunteered at the school.  (Well, sort of...Actually the teacher volunteered me)  It was the grade 6 graduation ceremonies and the grade 5 parents were asked to help.  R's teacher found out that I was a server and decided that I should be the one to hand out cake and punch.  Yay!  I knew that my years of experience would qualify me for an important job one day!  Anyway...I had fun.    The service was very well done and I got all teary eyed at the presentations.  I don't even know these kids!  I'll be a basket case next year when R graduates to grade 7.  One touching moment was the citizenship award.  The students were asked to vote for the person that they found to be the best friend, the most encouraging, helpful, trustworthy and fun person.  The award didn't go to the good looking sports guy or the pretty and popular socialite girl.  It went to this pudgy kid with glasses and a huge smile.  This kid had an energy about him!  He was jolly!  I was so proud of the kids who voted for him.  ( I would have thought from his look that he would have been picked on )  These children looked past exteriors and honoured this boy for who he is on the inside.  It was a beautiful thing!

      I have got to find the time and money to go shopping.  Sunday is Fathers day!  How'd that sneak up on me so fast?  I've got to find something for my Dad, my husband and the kids will want to get something for the he-ex also.  My nephew's birthday is almost here.  I still owe Dad a present for  his  birthday. (which was in April)  Oh...Then there's the teacher's end of the year gifts.  School's out on Tuesday.  K's been invited to a birthday party next week as well.  Count 'em up.  How many is that?  Do I need to get Hubby an anniversary present?  Does anyone do that?  And if so...Do you have any suggestions?  You'd think that after 12 years of marriage (10 and 2) that I'd be an expert.  Unfortunately....I am not.    BTW..We've talked about the working thing.  Haven't made any decisions about what to do, but we are communicating.  This after last night Hubby finally said to me, "You seem pissed off?"     R played a good soccer game last night.  He made two assists (I think that's more of a hockey term - but you know what I mean - right?)  and his team won the game 5 - 0!!!!  I'm so proud of him!  No need for a gift for this occasion. I bought him a pair of shorts yesterday.

      I haven't had much to say lately so I've been lazy...Just posting pictures.  I  do  have something on my mind and although I probably shouldn't share it with the outside world - I'm going to anyways...   Working.  I'm doing it five days a week.  The kids are out of school on Tuesday and we don't have any firm summer plans for their care.  Of course the he-ex would take them for the entire summer if I would allow it...Which of course - I won't.  Hubby came up with a plan that revolves around his shift work.  He figures that when he's on afternoons, he can watch the kids during the day while I'm at work.  The weeks that we're both working days, he wants to send the kids to the he-ex.  It's a good workable plan.  The problem is..I'm still not happy about it.  I want to be home with the kids.  I want to be able to enjoy their summer with them.  I  want  to take the summer off!    Hubby says that he just wants me to be happy, but he made it clear in a conversation on the weekend that he would be pissed off if he went to work every day and left me at home.  SO...Either I'm happy and he's not or he's happy and I'm not.  Why not compromise you ask?  I'm stubborn.  I want to be all the way right or else be a martyr.  I can't help thinking that when hubby was with the she-ex she didn't work.  She sent her child to daycare and spent her alone time (and his money) at bingo.  Why did he allow that?  Is it because she is the mother of his child?  I resent the fact that we still have another year to pay her $400/month in spousal support and I'm giving up precious time with my kids to work a crap job.  All I ever wanted to do was be a good wife and mother. I'm wondering if it's possible to do both simultaneously.

       urlLink    Story of a nose&nbsp; urlLink     K called me from her Grandparents house on Sunday to tell me the story of her nose.  On Saturday, they went for a long bike ride (without helmets) and she fell off her bike and landed on her face.  Then, when they arrived at their destination, they were jumping on a trampoline when her cousin kicked her nose.  Later that same day, K's father trying to hand her the phone, turned around and clocked her in the nose with the receiver.  All this just in time for her soccer portrait tonight.  Poor kid.

      Do Do Do Do...  After a brief but fairly friendly conversation with the she-ex on Thursday, I had a rather pleasant conversation with her this morning over the phone.  She talked, I asked questions, we laughed.  I  am  doing her a bit of a favour today...But I don't mind because it involves taking care of Em.  Hubby has seen his daughter every day so far this week!  It's as if we're in some kind of fairy tale.  Or maybe we all have amnesia and don't remember all of the horrid events of recent years.  Forgiveness  may  happen but I don't think any of us will ever forget.

      Not much going on these days except the usual work, eat, sleep (a little), soccer, laundry.  I've been thinking a lot about politics lately and trying to figure out which is the lesser of three evils, but I'm not going to get into that here.  The big buzz around these parts is the opening of the new Fallsview Casino in Niagara.  Every unemployed person that I knew around here is now working there.  Great benefits!  No, I don't want to work there.  I have my reasons.  I'm surprised that Hubby hasn't planned a visit there yet.  We got our free tokens in the mail yesterday.  The Bare Naked Ladies are playing there in a few days.  I wouldn't mind going to see them.  Love their harmonies and their sense of humour.  As for the gambling...I could take it or leave it.  It's supposed to be a nice place though.  Joe says that they have gold rimmed toilets.  Not a big selling feature in my books.  When my toilet gets a gold rim, I know that I have to clean it and lecture the boys again about their aim.

      How important is it for a step-parent to go to a child's soccer practice?   Not game -  practice .   I didn't think that it was that important.  Apparently, I may have been wrong.

      Argh!  The kids (lovely little bundles of joy) were so aggravating this morning.  Neither could find anything to wear, so I picked out clothes for them.  Of course, they didn't like what I picked and whined about it.  Then they didn't like the breakfast I made and complained about the lunch that I was packing for them.  My daughters room is so messy that I had to close the door.  I can't look at it.  (Yes, I know Mom, I'm getting back everything I gave you)  She almost made us late for school while trying to fix her hair.  She didn't like the way that I did her bangs. These kids have no idea how good they've got it.   We watched a few movies this weekend, but my favorite was Cheaper by the Dozen.  I could identify with the craziness of the household...And I've only got three!    Another Monday morning.  I've got to throw in another load of laundry (so the kids have something suitable to wear tomorrow), empty and re-fill the dishwasher (hooray for not having to wash dishes by hand anymore), have a shower and put on my all black uniform for work.  All black every day.  Feels like I'm going to a funeral every day!  Hmm...Wonder where the kids get their complaining from?  At least I have a job eh?

      I enjoyed reading everyone's blogs this morning.  I have about ten that I regularly check.   urlLink Christine  got me started blogging, and I often read her friends blogs.  Sometimes I'll go to the Blogger home page and read some of the most recently published blogs.  That's how I found  urlLink Erin's blog .  I have added many of her links to my favorites as well. There are a couple of other blogs that I frequent, however, the authors don't know that I'm reading their thoughts every day.  I always wonder who's reading mine.  Some of you comment, which I love - Thank you.  How many silent readers are out there?    I love the blogging community.  I have friends that I've never actually met!  It's so great to get different perspectives on life and it makes me realize that the world is a very big place.  I've often started a diary but never kept up with it until now.  Although I don't put my most personal thoughts and feelings on the net, I enjoy being able to express myself this way.  If you don't blog, I'd encourage you to start.  If you are a stranger to me, please contact me and say Hi. (smartipants@gmail.com) It'll make my day.  :)

      Hubby has spend endless hours at the computer researching places to stay and things to do while we are on vacation.  He will not rest until he's sure that he's got the absolute best price on everything!  Location is also very important to him.  He wants to know if there's a casino or horse races near by, and which restaurants are near the hotel.  Also, we need a place with a pool.  Eat, gamble, swim - Hubby's happy.  I am in awe of how much time he's put into this.  We're only going to Toronto!  It's an hour drive.  It's not like we're new to the city.  We've been to Wonderland, Ontario Place, the Science Center, CN Tower before.  I'm sure he'll have us on a tight schedule to maximize our entertainment value.  Not sure if we'll get much relaxing in though.  He's going to take me to Montreal for a couple of days for our anniversary.  He's been researching and planning this trip too.  Yes, there is a casino nearby.  (Just like the honeymoon)  I don't mind, because he's promised me that we can do some shopping! I'm looking forward to getting away - just the two of us.  It's been a long two years!  He's asked me to plan next years anniversary.  We'll alternate the responsibility from year to year.  A good plan I think.  I already have some ideas for our third and it won't involve McDonald's like last years memorable 1st anniversary. Ha Ha   I love this man.  He's so good to me.  How did I get so lucky?

      Last night my son had his first soccer game.  His team got creamed!  The other team was big, well organized and had shockingly white jerseys.  Randy is the smallest one on his team.  In fact, the biggest guy on his team is twice Randy's height.  As Randy was running down the field, one of the kids on the other team screamed out, "Look at the size of that guy!" in a mocking manner.  I resisted the urge to turn around and tell the giant fatty to shut up.    Yesterday at work, a co-worker said to me, "How old are you?  35?"    Today, I went to a table to ask how their meals were.  There were three people eating.  I try not to generalize by asking how  everything  was so I asked, "How did you enjoy the special?  Should I try it for lunch?" and "Did you like our new fries?" to which both answers were that the food was great.  Satisfied, I left the table.  As I was walking away the third person says, "The salad was crap.  Thanks for asking."   This is the same lady that asked for French Onion soup without the onions.

      June 1st and so far - no rain today!  I heard on the news yesterday that in May we had rain 20 of the 31 days.  I'm ready for some sun!  Actually, I sat out for a while on Sunday reading and I have a farmer tan...you know, white shoulders and bright red arms with a very noticable line where my T-shirt sleeves were.    It's a busy week this week.  Hubby is on afternoons, so I'm on my own.  Last night I took the kids shopping.  R got his new shoes and socks and K got a cute new dress and a Canada shirt.  Nothing for myself....I'm too fat.  Tonight K has a soccer game and there is also a fun fair at the school.  Tomorrow after work, I have a staff meeting, then K has soccer practice at 6 and R has a game across town at 7.  Thursday E has a game.  Friday, assuming I get off work in time, I'll pick up all three from school and keep them busy till Hubby gets home at 11 and then we can all go to bed and hopefully sleep in a bit on Saturday morning.  That reminds me...Have to fit in grocery shopping.  My brother-in-law is coming for the weekend and we're almost out of milk again.  And so begins another day...

      I was worried this morning when I went in to work because the schedule wasn't up yet. Usually it's up on Wednesday and when he waits 'till Friday that means that someone's not going to be on it next week. I was thinking that it could be me. He's fired every other server that was there before him. Turns out I'm safe. He put up the schedule. I have Monday off as suspected (and hoped) but am working Tues-Fri. Trish however was the unlucky person that didn't make it to next week. I asked for two days off the week following next. He said that it wouldn't be a problem. There are only two people that have been at the restaurant longer than I have and they're both bartenders. I must be doing something right to have survived all of the cleaning house that they've been doing. I've really got to start remembering customers names though. I think the guys are starting to wonder why I call them by the beer that they drink. Hey Coors Lite guy! How are ya?

"Yes Mom, a loving husband".&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm going to get one of those too"

      We went to Emily's soccer game last night.&nbsp; We were late 'cause Hubby said yes to an extra pizza delivery (his second job).&nbsp; We still got there just as the game started because there was no referee.&nbsp; I guess they had waited for him and then just decided that the coaches would ref.&nbsp;   Anyhoo...Emily's coach is a jerk.&nbsp; I think he has an anger problem.&nbsp; He yells at the kids in a tone that I don't appreciate.&nbsp; He can't handle his own spoiled little brat and takes it out on the other kids.&nbsp; That being said...Hubby is a stereotypical soccer dad.&nbsp; He continually forgets that these are 7 year olds that are playing for fun.&nbsp; Hubby is the loudest parent at a game shouting orders to the kids.&nbsp; The coach and Hubby have clashed many times.&nbsp; Last night the coach yelled at Hubby from the field.&nbsp; I then had to listen to Hubby muttering profanities to himself.&nbsp; It was all very embarrassing.&nbsp;&nbsp;   But...That was not all.&nbsp; The she-ex was sitting near us.&nbsp; apparently her butch of a sister was sitting at the other end of the field.&nbsp; They have had some sort of falling out over their mother's ashes which resulted in the ashes being divided three ways between the two sisters and their step-dad.&nbsp; The she-ex will not allow Emily to see her aunt.&nbsp; She came over to warn us that her sister was at the park and started dishing out the dirt on her sis.&nbsp; People are sitting on either side of us.&nbsp; It would have been impossible for them not to hear everything that was going on.&nbsp; After the she-ex left to go sit and finish watching the game, the butch came over to talk to us.&nbsp; She told us to keep an eye on Emily.&nbsp; She said that there was lots going on that we didn't know about and tried to trash the she-ex.&nbsp; Hubby put a stop to it saying that it was not the place to discuss these things.&nbsp; The butch left.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course the she-ex had to come back over to find out what her sister had said.   Just as we were leaving, the coach came over and warned Hubby to "watch it from the sidelines".&nbsp; All this happened in the course of an hour.&nbsp; Emily's team lost the game.&nbsp;   All this drama and I was the only one not being attacked!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; It was a nice change.&nbsp; If fact, everyone seemed to want me to align myself with their position.&nbsp; I just sat there being quiet and neutral wondering how my hair looked and if I should have wore the red shorts.

      I'm tired of getting phone calls from people asking for money.&nbsp; Yes, there are many causes out there that I'd love to support.&nbsp; Some that I do support financially...But here's one that I will never give money to:   The circus.&nbsp; Something to do with the police taking needy kids to see the circus.&nbsp; First of all, I think that this is a fund raiser for the police (who reported a surplus last year).&nbsp; They are using children to disguise their pitiful plea for cash as a charity event.&nbsp; Now I'm all for helping needy children.&nbsp; Maybe they're hungry.&nbsp; I'd rather buy them a good meal or some clean clothes...But the circus?&nbsp; I wouldn't pay that ridiculous admission price for my own kids to see the stupid circus.&nbsp; And since when did we have to pay for the police?&nbsp; Sure, they do some good things when they're not busy unlawfully arresting someone and sending them to jail for a long weekend - but that's another story.&nbsp; Are they actually paying these telemarketers to phone and harass nice people at their homes?&nbsp; After they do that and the police take their cut (whatever that might be), how much do these needy children actually get?&nbsp; A look at a dirty elephant?&nbsp; Maybe a bag of cotton candy?&nbsp; Maybe the kids would be better off attending VBS for the summer.&nbsp; And the police could just stay out of it.&nbsp; But then again....Maybe I'm missing the whole point.

      While Emily was here, her front tooth fell out.&nbsp; She is the only one of the three kids who still believes in the tooth fairy and Santa and all that.&nbsp; Of course, Even though my two know who the tooth fairy is, we still play along and give them a toonie under their pillow when they loose a tooth.&nbsp; Emily got a toonie for her tooth.&nbsp; She let us know the next morning that she wished she had waited to place the tooth under her pillow.&nbsp; "At my mom's house I get five bucks!"&nbsp; she announced.&nbsp; All that I could come up with was that it was a very small tooth that she lost and that the ones at her moms house must have been bigger.&nbsp; What I wanted to say was that if I had only one child, and was getting $1100.00 a month from my ex, the executive tooth fairy would visit my house as well.&nbsp; Our tooth fairy works a little harder and yet is underpaid.&nbsp; She's doing the best she can and thinks that the children should be grateful for what they get.&nbsp;

      Friday we went back to Paramount Canada's Wonderland.&nbsp; Yesterday we went to Ontario Place.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm still not comfortable with my haircut.&nbsp; On Friday I spent a lot of time doing it in the morning.&nbsp; Then after one ride and only about half an hour at the park, I decided to put it in a teeny tiny pony tail.&nbsp; Later, I removed the pony tail and put on a hat.&nbsp; Of course, I couldn't wear the hat on any of the rides and was stressed out that while strapped in to the coasters I couldn't reach my hair to fix it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yesterday, I did my hair and left it that way all day long!&nbsp; It was a kind of Meg Ryan look.&nbsp;&nbsp; We dropped off my two at their dads place.&nbsp; He took a quick look at my head and said "nice hair do".&nbsp; Not sure if he was being sarcastic or not.&nbsp; I'm surprised that he even saw my hair.&nbsp; His eyes were on my breasts for most of the time.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After that, we dropped Emily at her moms.&nbsp; She reminded us that today is soccer practice.&nbsp; I guess we are supposed to be there.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hubby and I came home to an empty house.&nbsp; He sat down at the TV and I sat down at the computer.&nbsp; Today, I should do some cleaning.&nbsp; Pick up all the toys and give the kids rooms a good cleaning.&nbsp; Maybe the kitchen floor will stay clean for a week?&nbsp; Hubby is back to work today.&nbsp; I go back tomorrow.&nbsp; I think that I now have Mondays off!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; Gotta love the four day work week.&nbsp;

      I did it!  I got my hair cut short.  It's above my shoulders but below my chin.  Cute - I think.  It seems to have given me a very slight face lift.  It's different!  Will take some getting used to, but I'm happy with it.  Now I just need to update my makeup.    Yes, I did it.  I always said that I wouldn't - But I did.  I got the thirty-something haircut.  Who was I trying to kid?  I drive a mini van and answer to "Mom" more often than I do to "Jan". It was time.  Actually, It was about three years overdue.    Also, after seeing our vacation video...I might just throw out those camouflage pants.

      Hubby took the kids to the video store the other day and they rented a bunch of old movies.  They're all in the living room watching one of them now.  This one I've seen before (like in the late 80's or early 90's) and am not interested in seeing it again.  I don't think it's appropriate for the kids and have removed myself from the room.  I can hear him saying to the kids "don't look...no, not yet...don't look....okay It's fine now- you can look."  Also he makes noises to try to cover up the profanity.  Guess he's the cool parent and I'm the uptight one.  I trust my kids.  They are well adjusted, don't swear and completely understand that movies are not real.  The sexual innuendo goes right over their heads and they know that the violence is all done by stuntmen and special effects.  But still...These things have ratings for a reason.  Hubby obviously didn't look at the ratings when he rented the movies.  They came home in generic DVD covers so I couldn't check the rating either.    My parents were very strict when I was a child about the things that we could and couldn't watch.  Hubby's childhood was much different.  It's amazing how we become our parents.  I wonder which rules and traditions our kids will adopt when they have their own families.  How strict will they be about table manners and clean rooms and bedtimes?  Speaking of bedtimes...I know there's no school tomorrow but shouldn't all good little children be sound asleep at this hour?  I know  I'm  ready for bed!

      Okay, so... Mon. July 5th  Got to Montreal at 11 a.m.  The room wasn't ready yet so we parked the van and started walking around the city.  Did lots of shopping and didn't get back to the hotel until dinner time.  Beautiful hotel room!  King size bed with white duvet.  Lots of little extras that I'm not used to.  Classy.  I had a nice long shower and got dressed and we went to dinner.  Excellent service.  Good food.  Then of course, we hit the casino.  (Went back to the hotel and changed again first)  My feet were already sore from a long day of walking.  We lost enough money for me to insist on leaving and returned to the hotel at about 1 a.m.  Hubby says to me; "What time do you want our wake up call?"  How about never?  I answered.  But he had them call us at 8.  Tues. July 6th  Woke up too early and got ready to go.  We had an amazing breakfast at the hotel and set out again for our day.  We walked up a block and were crossing the street when I stepped in a pot hole, twisted my ankle and fell on my knee.  Hubby picked me up out of the middle of the road and we sat down for a few minutes at a little cafe which happened to be on the corner.  My ankle hurt, but I figured that the pain would go away.  We walked to the subway (metro) and took it to the Olympic stadium.  Hubby wanted to do the tourist thing.  There we went to the top of the observatory and looked over the city.  Then we went across to the Biodome and spent some time there.  We then took the metro back downtown and shopped some more.  We visited the Jazz festival and China town.  Again, I wasn't feeling well, but we trudged on.  Went through the underground shopping malls and bought more stuff.  I finally convinced Hubby that we'd had enough shopping for one day and we went back to the hotel.  He went for a swim and let me have some time to rest my sore ankle and get dressed for dinner.  We walked downtown to a place and waited at the bar for a table.  This place was beautiful..Two levels, large patios, servers dressed in black with long white aprons.  We got a table upstairs at the entrance to the patio and had an incredible dinner.  By this time, I was in a lot of pain. My foot and ankle were swollen.  We finished dinner at midnight and walked back to the hotel, picked up the van and drove to the casino.  Didn't have much luck there and at one point I had to take Hubby's wallet away from him.  We got to sleep that night at about 4 a.m.  Hubby had them call us at 9 the next morning.  Wed. July 7th  Woke up, had breakfast, checked out, shopped some more.  Left Montreal at about 2:30.  Made it back to Mom and Dads at about 8:30.  They were just finishing up a birthday party for my nephew.  The kids didn't seem to miss us much.  We decided to stay there one more night and watched the Titanic with the kids.    Thurs. July 8th  The kids went swimming again.  We packed up and headed home.  Emily had a soccer game in the evening.    Fri. July 9th  We went to Canada's Wonderland.  Spent a full day there and had lots of fun.  I think I fixed my farmer tan.  I burned my shoulders and chest.  Hopefully it will not peel but will turn into a nice brown colour.    Sat. July 10th  Took the girls shopping for new bathing suits.  Got Aidan a birthday present and bought the game Scene It for myself.  Did laundry  Sun. July 11th  Went to Aidan's birthday party.  Added to my sunburn.  Went back to Mom and Dad's.  The kids swam some more.  We played Scene It.  Hubby and the kids watched a movie when we got home.  I went to bed!  Mon. July 12th  That's today!  Congratulations if you made it through this whole boring entry!  Today so far, I woke up, had chocolate milk and blogged.  Montreal is a beautiful city.  The people there are friendly and very hospitable.  I would love to go back. Hopefully they will have fixed the pothole on Rue Guy by then.  When I get my other computer fixed, I'll probably post a couple of pics.  We're off this week too but will be staying close to home.  The kids have soccer every night this week.  Not much planned for today.  Just taking it easy.

      Not much time to post cause I'm off to a birthday party but I've got lots of days to catch up on so....Here's the cold version:  Fri. July 2nd Finished work.  Took the kids to the drive in to see Spiderman.  Also saw White Chicks which was funnier than I thought it would be.  Got home late - like 3 a.m.    Sat. July 3rd Went to the Friendship Festival in Fort Erie...But first to the horse races.  Races: not fun.  But we endured it for Hubby's sake.  I wasn't feeling good so when we got to the festival Hubby took the kids to the fair while I tried to get some rest in the van.  After about an hour and a half, they came and got me and we went for dinner.  Had an amazing jerk chicken pizza.  Felt better.  The kids rode the rides until midnight and we watched the 4th of July fireworks from across the river.  Another late night - but fun.  Sun. July 4th Got ready, packed up clothes and went to Mom and Dads.  Played a game.  Said our goodbyes and went to bed.    Mon. July 5th Got up at 5 a.m.  and headed for Montreal.  We were expecting an 8 hour drive.  Made it in 5!    I'll tell ya the rest later.  Got more partying to do!

      Today was my last day of work for two full weeks!  Yay!  I'm officially on holidays...Just have to change out of this uniform.  Today got off to a pretty slow start at work for me.  Only had one table.  Mike got fired and Kevin was alone in the kitchen.  No worries...It was going to be a slow day.  Then a team of 20 baseball players showed up.  We handled the rush very well and everyone appeared to leave happy.  The team was from the States - I'm not sure exactly where 'cause I didn't get much of a chance to talk to them.  I did know however, not to serve vinegar with their fries 'cause they don't do that south of the border.  The boys were very nice and polite and were a pleasure to serve.  When the bill came, I heard some grumbling about the size of it.  They are obviously not used to our 15% tax and didn't budget for it.  But they did tip well in the end.  One of the younger ones handed me the stack of cash and then separately handed me an American dollar bill.  "Will you take this too?"  He asked, "It's American."  Well duh!  "Even better!"  I said with a smile, but the smart ass in me wanted to say, "Wow!  Is  that  what they look like?  I've never seen one of these before!  Is it true that all of your money is the same colour?"  (That's color in the states)  "I'll take it back to my igloo and keep it in a safe place eh."  Even stranger than the fact that he thought he had to explain the origin of the currency (bless his heart) was that there was a Canadian dollar bill in the pile of moolah.  Yes!  A dollar bill - not a looney.  Dated 1973.  Wish he didn't leave so quickly.  I'd have explained to him that it was far more rare to see one of those than an American dollar.  My kids hadn't seen one before! I know he didn't get if from a bank.  His parents must have saved it from their last trip north.  When we go south we hear "Y'all come back now ya hear".  Message to Mr. America...Don't be a stranger eh.

      While most of the country has today off of work...Hubby and I will be pursuing the mighty dollar.  K is wearing her red and white Canada tank and has put Canada Flag tatoos on her face.  I guess we'll have to go somewhere tonight so that she can show them off.  E has a soccer game.  I wonder if there will be fireworks in the area tonight.  July 1st fireworks to ring in the summer.  Yeah, we've got to find some.    I'm getting paid this weekend to go and see Spiderman!  Woo Hoo.  Pretty good gig when you can get it.  Ahhh summer time.  My favorite time of year.  (Christmas is my second favorite)  Picnics and swimming pools, beaches and fireworks, drive-in movies and sitting out on the patio with friends.  Love it!  Let the summer begin!  Oh..and Happy birthday Canada.

      Last night I sat on the front porch and watched the sunset. Quietly feeling the cool breeze mixed with the warm sun on my face. I sat and listened to the crickets sing and watched the orange sky. There is a sort of sadness this time of year. The gradual grieving of a summer nearly gone. The colours have already begun to change - not on the trees but in the sky. I have many nice memories of evenings like this one and just realized that this time - right now - August is my favorite time of year.

      Good news first: Today has been a hive free day!!!!! I don't know why - but I'll take it!  Now for the bad news: The situation at Hubby's work has been resolved but not the way we were hoping. He's been suspended for 10 days from work. Here's the story:  He went in on Saturday to work a 7 - 3 shift. Overtime. There were only about 7 guys in the whole plant. He did his work, gave them more than the quota in parts and went to sit down in the cafeteria to read. He started to doze off a little with his head in his hand, his elbow on the table and a paper in front of him. This was at 2p.m. (on a Saturday - just to remind you) A security guard came in the door and asked Hubby if he was sick. Hubby said "no". The guard left.  It turns out that someone had called an ambulance and reported a "man down". There was no man down and the paramedics made a trip for nothing. Nobody knows who called or why. The security guard (not the foreman) informed the area manager that he caught Hubby sleeping in the cafeteria. Thus the ten day suspension without pay.  Somebody is trying to cover their ass and Hubby is the scapegoat. This is so insane. Hubby has not missed a day in nine years, is never late and is one of two or three who always give the company quota. It's common practice for them to sit in the cafeteria when their work is done and of course on a Saturday when it's overtime and hardly anyone is there, the atmosphere is going to be a bit more relaxed. HE DID HIS JOB AND MORE! So he closes his eyes and misses two weeks of pay. Needless to say there will be a grievance.  If anyone wants to go golfing in the next week and a half...I might have a partner for ya.

      I'm sorry. I've tried to hold back - but I have to complain. I have had really bad hives everyday - ALL day for almost a week now. Tuesday my upper lip was swollen. I looked like a duck. I've got them from the top of my head to the bottoms of my feet. They are driving me crazy. In fact, this uncomfortable ugly burning itch all over my body overrides all my other thoughts and feelings. I can't concentrate on anything else except maybe that there's a good explanation for all of this. Maybe something good will come of it. Maybe I will be glad that I didn't down a bottle of pills to make this all go away. But it's too early to test.

      After reading  urlLink Rangeley's  comments, I decided to get rid of my Blogger comments also and go back to using  urlLink Comment this  so you don't have to sign in. Well, of course I messed it up and lost just about everything except for the Blogger comments. I'll keep working on it but have wasted a good part of the morning here sitting on my butt in front of a screen. So, I'm off to get dressed and do some shopping. No kids, Hubby's at work. My options: clean house or shop? I need to do both. I think I'll shop first and then clean later if I have the time and energy. Ha

      I love Queer Eye for the Straight Guy!!! I haven't seen it though since Direct TV started cracking down on people who steal satellite signals.    Take the quiz:  urlLink "Which'>http://www.zenhex.com/quiz.php?id=487">"Which  'Queer Eye' Guy Are You?"     Kyan  You are Kyan! Always conscious of how you look, you don't consider your face ready for the day without moisturizing. Your bathroom is probably spotless. You could navigate a hair salon blindfolded. Keep stylin' away, and don't forget, cleanse, then moisturize!

      So since my kids are at their dad's place, I'm picking up the slack and feeding the guinea pig (K's job) and delivering newspapers (R's job). So I was on my (his) paper route yesterday when I saw the she-ex drive by. She had to have seen me but completely ignored me. A polite wave would have been nice, but whatever. I guess it's not cool to know the 33 year old paper girl. I took a few minutes to think bad thoughts about her and then moved on. She was on her way to camp to pick up Emily and was to drop her off at our house. An hour and a half later and she still hadn't arrived at our door. Just as I had said to Hubby that he should call and find out what's going on, the phone rang. I picked it up and the she-ex asked to speak to Hubby. It turns out that on the road to the camp she hit a bus head on. Everyone was okay. No injuries. How do you hit a bus head on???? I just want to know. Don't you see it coming and at least try to get out of its way? She asked Hubby about her insurance - like he'd know. I wondered if she even had any or if she somehow thought that he was paying it for her - which he is NOT. She was able to drive back to our place and drop off Em but somehow can not drive the car this morning to take Emily back to camp. I got up early and took her this morning. The she-ex warned Hubby about picking Emily up after camp today because the she-ex's best friend who also has kids going to the same camp is going to tell everyone there terrible things about him. What's up with that? If we're doing her a favour, I'd think she could muzzle her friend for a day. Not that we really care what anyone else thinks. The only person the gossip will hurt is Emily. Another thought to ponder...Why has the she-ex and her best friend both taken to wearing their hair in pigtails? It's cute at 4 years old - but 44? Not so much.

      I have been in contact with some famous people...Before they were famous. I went to high school with Sarah Harmer. Sat beside her in World Religions class. Actually, I had a few classes with her and was friends with some of her friends. She never gave me the time of day though. Also, I recently found out that Finger Eleven went to my school. I didn't realize that they were once the Rainbow Butt Monkeys. Can't say that I knew any of these guys personally. They were a couple of years younger than me. I just tried to look them up in the yearbook. Only could find one. Sean Anderson. Let me tell you....In looking at his pic - You'd never  ever  think he'd become a rock star! The he-ex (who also went to high school with me and probably picked on those Finger Eleven guys) is still trying to be a rock star. Go figure.

      Had a great weekend.  Saturday we went back to Canada's Wonderland.  Sunday we had a family picnic.  Got sunburned.  Kids and Hubby went swimming.  Ate well.  Had good conversation with the girls in my family who happen to be my best friends.  Learned a few things.   Today is a boring day.  Hubby went to work.  I'm doing laundry.  Ventured outside to see if we had any raspberries left.  I could only find seven.  I think Emily's already eaten them.  There's a sale on ice cream.  I think I'll go pick some up.
