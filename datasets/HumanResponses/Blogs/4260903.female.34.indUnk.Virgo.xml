      I ran around cleaning all morning because Grandma (and Mom and Dad) was coming at 11am.  we went nuts and the whole family was actually helping.  Thank goodness they were 1 1/2 hours late.  We got a lot done - plus did some "stash-and-dash".  Of course as soon as Mom got there she pointed out all the stuff on the stairwell I forgot about.   Grandma was no trouble and after I drank coffee (Mom stress, I guess) I ate well all morning and afternoon.  I started with a few bananas in the morning and an hour or so later I ate a almost a whole canteloupe.  I was trying to get the kids to eat it, but they didn't want much.  In the afternoon I ate a nectarine.  By dinnertime I was really hungry.  I know I need to eat more during the day, but I don't feel so hungry until I smell dinner cooking.  Bill made chicken wings, string beans, and rice.   I read another article about how rushing into going 100% raw is way too severe for most people.  It pretty much made me feel better about the rate I'm going.  Ideally, any cooked food I eat should be vegan or at least vegetarian, but I'm only two weeks into this and I know I'll get there.  I ordered a couple of "raw" books.  The onle by Shazzie and the one by Alissa Cohen.  It will definitely help me to have these in front of me and always visible for constant motivation.   Dd (8), Julia, has mild ADD and I have her on a homeopathic/vitamin therapy called Attend by Vaxa.  It's been several weeks and I don't see much, if any, improvement.  Maybe I need to give it more time.  I'm expecting the second bottle today.  I'm going to encourage her to go raw with me.  I know raw living is good for mental clarity and has helped kids with ADD.  The Hallelujah Acres website mentions Barleygreen (Barleymax?)  as an essential supplement.  It's supposed to be great for kids with ADD - along with a high raw diet.  I'm going to try that very soon, too.  I'm also trying behavior modification, and maybe neurofeedback somewhere in the future.  I will never put her on medication.   So, the weekly stats are exactly the same as last week.  I think I'm going to do things a bit differently this week.  I know the books will help.  I want to see a change by next Sunday!

      We just got back from Six Flags (New England).  What a cool place.  The kids had a great time and thank goodness we got to crash at a hotel last night.  I don't think I would have been able to make the drive home at 10pm.  I was worried about eating, but did ok under the circumstances.  I ate half of my last mango Friday morning followed by coffee and a roll for the drive up.  At the park I had a beautiful, huge salad for lunch with a bottle of Poland Spring.  I felt so good after that.  Dinner and this morning's breakfast was a different story.  Now that we're home, though, I'm doing good.  I just had a red plum and am about to have some Greek salad that Bill is making.  His has feta, mine won't , but it has romaine, tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, and green pepper.   It's getting a little easier to break old habits and not eat like a pig just because everyone else is.  I really    love   food and   I'm glad I can eat a lot of the raw food and still feel in control.  Grandma is coming over tomorrow.  We kind of have to "babysit" her since Mom and Dad are going to a party and Gram has dementia and can't be alone.  I'm happy to, though.  She's no trouble.  I try out a few raw things on her sometimes when I go visit (she lives with my parents) and she really likes them - especially carrot juice.  It's funny, after carrot juice, Grandma starts walking around the house a lot.  I guess it really does give you energy!        Tomorrow I weigh myself.  Sigh.  I didn't do all that great this week, so I probably haven't lost anything yet.  No matter, it'll just motivate me to do better next week.

       urlLink     I  felt kind of energetic today . I slept pretty good last night and got up at 8. I wanted to do so much today with the kids, but when the house is a mess I can't go anywhere until it's presentable. The kids really enjoy just going out on the block to ride bikes or play tag with friends, but we never got a chance to get out. Guilt. Well, we're going to Six Flags tomorrow, so that should make up for today!    I cut up another mango this morning. I onlyhave 2 left so I better get shopping. Bill's going tonight so I have to remember to tell him to pick some up. Later on I ate a few almonds and a few dried currants and at around 4pm I had a huge amount of watermelon. I actually feel full without feeling like I ate too much. Cool.  Kait made pasta alfredo for dinner. I will probably have a very small bowl of it with a very big salad. And I only had 2 cigs today. I may have one more after dinner though. Wow, I usually have about 10 a day. This week is going nicely so far.

      Wow, I love fruit.  I read that in order to lose weight with raw food, you shouldn't eat stuff with a lot of fat or sweet fruits.  Of course my favorite things are stuff with a lot of fat and sweet fruits.  This morning I started with a banana.  Then I had such a delicious mango a little while later.  I never had mangos growing up.  We were your basic Northern European, Irish, English, Italian family complete with huge amounts of cooked food.  The only raw things I remember eating was an apple and banana here and there, celery (with cream cheese on it) and that bag of nuts at Thanksgiving, and the occasional salad after we moved in with my Italian stepdad.  We thought mangos and coconuts were weird and only saw them in the Spanish bodegas down the street.  Now I can't live without those.   A few hours later we all shared a big bowl of red grapes.  I feel so good after only fruit in the morning.  When I started this new way of eating, I knew I'd have to take it slow in order to stick with it and I decided the only step I will take for now is having only fruit in the morning.  I've done that before with Fit for Life, Somersizing, and Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover.  I do stay raw usually until dinnertime, so I feel I'm ahead of the game.  Today's lunch and dinner were disastrous so let's not even go there.   I'm drinking mainly spring water or fresh juice now - no more pepsi or iced tea.  And I had 4 cigs today.  Maybe I'll quit before my birthday.  The better I feel, the less I want to smoke.  Tomorrow I'll break out that pilates tape I've been meaning to get to.  I only had 3 hours of sleep last night (because I had coffee at mom's last night so I wouldn't fall asleep driving home and it kept me awake until 5am!)  so I'm off to bed now.

      I want to consider myself a rawfoodist.  Yes, I like to make it one word.  I love the whole concept.  I feel I have the gist of it down, but I'm still reading everything I can get my hands on about the subject.  Can changing one's diet like this really change the person?  I want to change.  I haven't been too thrilled with myself lately.  After 3 kids, my weight is up there and I look and feel like hell.  I started adding more and more raw food into my life a couple of weeks ago, but this week is my true beginning.  I am in love with the idea of natural hygiene and living the way I know we're supposed to.   I'm in what they call a "transitional" phase right now.  I am eating a few complicated meals trying to get the taste and feel of cooked crappy food.   But I do appreciate the simple, mono foods as well.  I think I'm at around 75% raw at the moment with the expectation of getting to 95% in the near future.  The fun part of this whole thing is that I'm tasting new things such as young coconut, dates, and berries that are fresh and organic and not smushed little pathetic plastic-y things found in frozen pancakes.   Let me tell you what I ate today.  I started the morning with coffee.  Ok, I'm down to one cup one or two mornings a week.  Not bad for someone who relied on that thrice daily caffeine jolt just to get some housework done.  Lets pretend I didn't have that.  Anyway, I ate a banana and drove with everyone out to my mom's.  Bill (hubby dearest) took off today to spend some family time.  I actually brought a huge bage of food and my old juicer.   We stopped off at 7-11 where the kids all got a free slurpee (and Bill too)  and I got a great looking, huge salad for $3.99.  At mom's I cut up a nice mango and threw it in the salad (instead of dressing).  That was actually really yummy.  I never thought mango and onions would taste ok together (then Bill reminded me that Bobby Flay made mango salsa once).   Later on I juiced a bunch of carrots with a bit of apple - Kait (10) had some, too.  She loves fresh juice - and makes killer smoothies.  At dinnertime Dad ordered out pizza and salad.  So I had one slice of pizza with a giant sized plate of salad.  Hey, I'm not perfect.  I ended the night with one glass of zinfandel and totalled about 5 cigarettes for the day.  I am quitting this vile habit on my 35th birthday which is in exactly 22 days.   Most days are like this - last week was worse - next week will be better.  I really do love eating raw.  I have a bit of a hard time with peer pressure/will power/power of suggestion - call it what you want.  I'm overcoming that as well.   Here are the current stats:  Weight: 185.5  (I'm 5'4", so this sucks) Bust:  40" Waist:  37" Hips:  43" Upper Arm:  14" Thigh:  22"
