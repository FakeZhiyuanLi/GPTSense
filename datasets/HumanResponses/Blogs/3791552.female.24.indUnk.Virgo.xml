      It was reported today on Fox News (Dayside with Linda Vester)that Sheikh Omar Abdel al-Rahman, the infamous blind cleric associated with the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, has complained about none other than the type of tea he is being served while incarcerated.  Omar also is diabetic and continues to eat ridiculous amounts of M&M's to inflict worse diabetic symptoms, and was also caught on videotape beating his leg against the bars in his cell to further damage an existing injury. When asked about the tea situation, Omar could not remember specifically which tea was his favorite-he just knew that it was not being served to him.  Obviously Omar is trying (once again) to ignite terrorist anger and trigger more terrorist activities.  Why this man is even being allowed luxuries such as tea while imprisoned is beyond me. Personally I don't think he should have anything that is not a necessity. Before you make your mind up about this situation, please read the biography below to understand the type of man we are dealing with here.  Sheikh Omar Abdel al-Rahman served as the spiritual leader to Egypt's largest militant group, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, formed in 1973. The group is probably best known for killing 62 people outside a site in Luxor in 1997. This group has also been linked to the International Front for Jihad against Jews and Crusaders, which was formed by al-Qaeda and a few other terror organizations.   Al Gama'a originally planned to overthrow Egypt's secular regime and create an Islamic state. This group believes only in jihad, diplomatic resolution is not a possibility. Omar issued a fatwa (religious ruling justifying actions normally condemned by law)for the assassination of Sadat in 1981. He only served 6 months time due to a technicality. The new Egyptian leader did not tolerate terrorism and began jailing any person remotely linked to terrorist activity. In 1990 Omar moved to Sudan and recieved a Sudanese passport stating that was his place of birth, although that was his first visit to Sudan. It has been speculated that bin Laden helped Omar acquire this passport because this is around the time the two met. After he received the passport, Omar went to the US Embassy and was granted a B2 VISA (6 months).   In 1991, he used that VISA to come to America. He proceeded through claims at JFK Airport without any problems whatsoever. At the time, he was on the State Department's Terrorist Watch List. How he was granted the VISA with no signs of the government knowing is still questioned. He began delivering sermons at mosques in New Jersey and Brooklyn referring to America as "Satan America" and "The American Whore". He also stated that Allah decreed that all infidels (non-muslims) should be put to death if they refused to convert to Islam. He was creating Islamic jihad against America. Omar befriended a FBI informant, Salem, and included him in his inner circle. Obviously Omar had no idea Salem was connected with the government.  In 1992 Salem warned of a terror attack on one of many chosen NYC landmarks  to take place in early 1993. On February 26, 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed. In 1996, Omar and nine other accomplices were jailed in the US for conspiracy to destroy New York City landmarks. Omar continued to direct terror cells from prison-often with the help of his translator and defense lawyer who were both charged in 2002 with accomplice to terrorist activities.   Does this sound like a man who should have a choice of tea-or any tea at all for that matter?

      CNN reported today that some 5600 retired and discharged soldiers will be involuntarily called for Active Duty.  The Army stated that these soldier's assistance will be needed in either Afghanistan or Iraq.  None of these soldiers are currently members of The National Guard or Reserve. The Army has been researching a list of an estimated 118,000 "eligible individual reservist for a few weeks" to find soldiers experienced in areas such as civil affairs.  This does not make sense to me at all.  Why would those countries require more soldiers from us than they needed before the ruin of the Taliban or Hussein?  As far as Iraq is concerned, the UN has agreed to train Iraqi's to ensure the stability of the country.  I can not even speak intelligently about Afghansitan, because I lost track of the current events there since the search for bin Laden.  We have implemented both of these countries with civil governments. How much longer do American forces need to be present?  Are we ever going to step out and let these countries run themselves?  I realize that initially all forces can not vacate, but what is the purpose of sending more soldiers?  Furthermore, why should the American people see the logic (if there is any) in sending retired and discharged military personnell?  These are men and women who have already served their country, and although they may not mind becoming active again I do not think this is a fair decision.

      I thought that the sickness I felt in my stomach every time I heard the name Scott Peterson could not get any worse-until I heard the name Mark Hacking.&nbsp; The inconsistent statements from both husband's and&nbsp;their behavior before and after the disappearances/murders are too similar for comfort to me.   Is murder the new get-rid-of-someone technique? What happened to the days of good old D-I-V-O-R-C-E?&nbsp; The thing that really gets me about both of these cases is the fact that both women were/are pregnant? I keep using past and present tense when referring to Laci Peterson and Lori Hacking because we know that Laci is deceased, but I am hoping that Lori will be found alive and well.   Scott seems a little more stable and methodical of a killer than Mark. Scott has always kept his cool while in the public eye and very quickly come up with excuses for his habitual derailment on the comment train. Mark, on the other hand, was found running naked in a hotel parking lot and checked into a psychiatric ward since the disappearance of his wife.  With Scott's affair with Amber and Mark's lying to everyone (including his wife) about being accepted to med school in North Carolina when the fool never even went to college, I find it hard to think these characters had nothing to do with his respective incident.  So, is it easier just to kill your spouse than to get rid of them through divorce? Is the red tape and paperwork so horrid that one would turn to murder? Or do other factors play in, such as collecting insurance money, cashing in on the will, etc?  Please enlighten me on your thoughts out there bloggers, because although I would like to not judge before these two men are proven guilty it is very hard.   urlLink Blogroll Me!

      On July 18, 1969 Mary Jo Kopechne drowned to death. She was involved in a car accident with none other than Edward "Ted" Kennedy. Kennedy and Kopechne were at a party at Chippaquiddick, an area only a ferry's ride away from Martha's Vineyard.&nbsp; The two were attending a party when they decided to go for a ride. Somehow, the car crashed off of the Dike Bridge and landed in a tidal pond.   Twelve&nbsp;people were in attendance&nbsp;at this party, where Kennedy and the others had rented a cottage and were gathered for a cookout. All attendees claim the party was totally innocent,&nbsp;but five of the men were married (including Kennedy) and all six of the girls were single. The six women were working on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign the year before but were forced to quit in leiu of his murder.   Kopechne and Kennedy decided to leave the party to return to Edgartown just before midnight. Kennedy claims that he turned onto a gravel road by accident and lost control of the car, landing it in the pond. He says that he tried to rescue Kopechne but was unsuccesful and walked back to the party. He got his cousin Joseph Gargan and a friend of the family Paul Markham to go back to the scene of the accident for a second try.  The three men went to a ferry landing where spontaneously Kennedy dove in the water and swam across to Edgartown.   The two men were surprised to learn that Kennedy as of the next morning had not reported the accident yet, which they were sure he would have done the night before. Nine hours passed, and the accident had been reported by an uninvolved part when Kennedy came forward as the driver.   Kennedy attended the funeral with a neck brace that he was never seen wearing again. The Kopechne family refused an autopsy, with a check for about 150,000 dollars from the Kennedy family showing up in their account.   Rumors still circulate to this day that Kopechne had told Kennedy that she was pregnant shortly before the accident. This would make sense with the autopsy not being performed.   The events leading up to and after the accident have never been totally verified, and all of the partygoers gave officials varying stories.   The only thing I keep thinking about is that if she was pregnant, which I am pretty sure she was, that baby would have been around 35 years old today. I had heard about this accident and the death of Kopechne through the years, but had never really read anything about it. The implication that Kennedy did this on purpose is no big surprise to me. The Kennedy family has also been said to have killed Marilyn Monroe because she threatened to go public with her affair with JFK. Remind me to never get involved with a Kennedy, although that would be hard because all of the men (with the exception of Ted) seem to meet their demise very young.

      This is just stupid to me. Medicare has decided that treatments facilitated for obesity should be covered. Why exactly should my tax payer dollars be spent to make someone thin who can not control their eating habits? Should other people who have cancer or other serious diseases be penalized and have to share their health care money with someone who can't keep their mouth away from a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese? I don't think so.  You know, I work out all of the time and am still not totally happy with the appearance of my thighs...maybe I could get on Medicaid (since I am not 65 yet) and request liposuction. I am in better health than the above mentioned group, so why should that be a problem? Anyone?   urlLink Blogroll Me!

      Al-Jazeera aired a videotape showing an unharmed Angelo de la Cruz with someone not shown on camera reading a statement issued from him. The news reader stated de la Cruz wanted to thank the Phillipines president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, for her  decision to withdraw troops from Iraq. He also wanted his wife to "wait for me, I'm coming back to you."  Wednesday eight of fifty-one Filipino humanitarian troops had left Iraq and the remaining troops will be out by July 20. The Phillipines had previously vowed allegiance to the US and her allies, stating Manila would not back down. Apparently pressure from protestors caused a change of heart in Manila, which ultimately could weaken ties with the country's allies.  The Phillipines decision to withdraw has received criticism from leaders of assisting countries in Iraq, some of which have lost citizens of their own due to terrorist attacks. The US, Australia, and South Korea have all issued statements expressing confusion and scrutiny regarding Manila's decision to make deals with terrorist organizations.  In my opinion, it is a bad idea to make pacts with terrorists. To me, this just gives them more reason to continue the behavior that has become so frequent. It reminds me of a little baby screaming and screaming until he gets his way. The baby will never learn unless you just let it be and cry for a while.

      Tuesday Al-Jazeera reported that the network had received a tape of the execution of one of the Bulgarian hostages. Now officials are wondering if that is true or not. No one apparently has actually seen the documentation of the supposed murder, but the Bulgarian government has issued a statement saying that no changes are in the future for their policies or involvement in Iraq. This could be attributed to the fact that Bulgaria is a very new member of NATO and they probably don't want to piss anyone off.   I really hope these two hostages and all of the others are still alive and will make it home safely.

      Al-Jazeera reported today that one of the two Bulgarian hostages that were being held by the Jihad and Unification group has been killed. The method of killing is not known at the time. The militants have threatened to kill the remaining hostage in 24 hours if Iraqi female prisoners are not released. The two hostages are Ivailo Kepov and Georgi Lazov, but it is unclear at the time which is deceased. The Jihad and Unification group behind these killings claim allegiance to al-Zaqarwi and are reportedly responsible for the beheadings of Nick Berg and Kim Sun-il.  An Egyptian hostage is being held hostage and his captors are threatening to kill him unless his Saudi employer leaves Iraq within 72 hours.  The fate of Angelo de la Cruz from the Phillipines is still undecided. His captors had given an extension, but the kidnappers failed to give a time or date of the announcement. Officials are wondering deadline from what point in time.  These killings are becoming a little too frequent for my taste. A month ago it was shocking, and now it is easy to adapt a nonchalant attitude about it. Even though I may seem like I am writing about something unimportant, my prayers are with the victims and their families. This is fucking ridiculous, but what can you do? I feel like even if everyone does what they demand, they will just come up with some other reason to murder.

      A Saudi Interior Minsitry Official announced today that Khaled al-Harbi has surrendered himself to the Saudi Arabian government. He turned himself in at the Saudi Embassy in Tehran, Iran and was flown to Saudi Arabia. It is believed that al-Harbi was living somewhere near the Afghan-Iran border.  On June 23 Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia announced that any terrorist or terror suspect who turned themself in within a month would be dealt with in a lighter manner than if they did not. Any person classified as  terrorist who turns themself in will be exempt from the death penalty. al-Harbi has not been charged with any attacks in Saudi, which was the stipulation of the announcement. Saudi government said nothing of attacks that had taken place in other countries. Although al-Harbi is not suspect in any attacks on Saudi soil, it is highly unlikely that he will be released.  al-Harbi fought with bin Laden against the Soviets in Afghanistan about twenty years ago, and later returned to join forces with al Qaeda in the 1990's.  In late 2001 al-Harbi was identified on a videotape discussing the September 11 attacks with bin Laden.  "Hundreds of people used to doubt you until this huge event happened. Now hundreds of people are coming out to join you." bin Laden responded that the damage caused was more than the coordinators had imagined possible. "We calculated that the floors that would be hit would be three or four floors." al-Harbi stated today, "Undoubtedly, it is an opportunity any logical man would thank God--every logical man should take advantage of this opportunity."  I was not very sure if it was such a great idea to make deals with terrorists, but in retrospect obviously this approach is working better than I thought it would. It is highly doubtful that every terrorist in the world will turn themselves in, but apparently this is having a different (better) outcome than I thought it would. That is what I get for being skeptical I suppose.

      CNN reported Friday that members of Hassoun's family had visited him in Lebanon at the US Embassy in Beirut. It is being widely speculated that Hassoun was fleeing his duties as a Marine to go to Lebanon at the time of his capture, or that the entire kidnapping was a hoax. Officials are under the impression that he faked his kidnapping in order hide the fact that he deserted his unit. "Right now, his story just doesn't add up and Cpl. Hassoun has a lot of explaining to do."  The 24-year old Lebanese born Marine was raised in Lebanon, leaving in 1999 for Utah to join his parents and a brother. He was educated in American schools in Tripoli and joined the Marines in 2001. He had not been back to Lebanon since until his arrival at the US Embassy. He married an American lady two years ago but they have since divorced. He reportedly has married a cousin whom still resides in Lebanon, but there was no ceremony and his father signed the marriage contract for him which is apparently permitted in Islam.   A spokesman for the Bahrain-based American Navy's 5th Fleet said the "matter is under investigation by Naval Criminal Investigative Service" and another military official stated that "Technically in time of war, desertion is punishable by death, but nobody's talking about that right now."

      It seems that Cpl. Wassef Hassoun has been released by his captors. A spokesman for the abducted Marine stated that Hassoun called his family members in Lebanon and Utah to let them know he had been released. He apparently called the United States Embassy in Beirut and asked for transportation. His location at the time of the call has not yet been publicized. There has been no confirmation from the Pentagon or the State Department verifying this information as of yet, but there is no doubt in my mind he has found his way to safety.   Cpl. Hassoun was reported missing by US Marine Corps on June 20th, and the Pentagon listed him as missing on July 1st. His kidnappers had threatened to behead him if the US forces did not free Iraqi prisoners. The group, calling itself "Islamic Response", stated Monday that Hassoun "has been sent to a safe place after he had announced his forgiveness and his determination not to go back to the US forces."  The 24 year old Marine of Lebanese descent was working as a translator. He is fluent in Arabic, French, and English.   I am interested to see what Hassoun has to say as far as the treatment he received while being held, what exactly went on, the events leading up to his capture, and I am mostly anticipating seeing what he plans to do with his life now.

      Senator John Edwards (D-NC) received a call at 7:30 Tuesday morning from Senator Kerry extending the invitation for Edwards to run on the Democratic ticket as Vice President for the race to the White House. Really, I don't have too much to say about this. I just would like some opinions back. Isn't it ironic (at the risk of sounding too Morrissettish) that both disagree on many things other than being democrats? Don't forget, when the two were battling for the Presidential Nomination on the Democratic side, neither had anything nice to say about the other until it was decided that Kerry won.  Kerry stated in January that Edwards was very inexperienced in politics (stopped practicing law in 1998) and was probably "still in diapers when I returned from Vietnam".  This morning while announcing Edwards as his pick Kerry said that Edwards "is ready for the job".  HMMM??  I think Kerry deserves credit here-Edwards is more appealing in the looks department and a good ol' southern boy. The last time two senators were on the same ticket was in 1960 when Kennedy chose Johnson as his Vice President...and they won.

      I received this on e-mail, and thought I would share it with y'all. I was told that it was written by an Australian dentist, but am not positive on that. Anyway, enjoy!  An American is English, or French, or Italian, Irish, German,Spanish, Polish, Russian or Greek. An American may also be Canadian,Mexican, African, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Australian,Iranian, Asian, or Arab, or Pakistani, or Afghan. An American may alsobe a Cherokee, Osage, Blackfoot, Navaho, Apache, Seminole or one of the many other tribes known as native Americans. An American is Christian, or he could be Jewish, or Buddhist, orMuslim. In fact, there are more Muslims in America than in Afghanistan.The only difference is that in America they are free to worship as each of them chooses. An American is also free to believe in no religion. For that he will answer only to God, not to the government, or to armed thugs claiming to speak for the government and for God. An American is from the most prosperous land in the history of the world. The root of that prosperity can be found in the Declaration of Independence, which recognizes the God given right of each person the pursuit of happiness.  An American is generous. Americans have helped out just about every other nation in the world in their time of need.  When Afghanistan was over run by the Soviet army 20 years ago, Americans came with arms and supplies to enable the people to win back their country!  As of the morning of September 11, Americans had given more than any other nation to the poor in Afghanistan. Americans welcome the best, the best products, the best books, the best music, the best food, the best athletes. But they also welcome the least. The national symbol of America, The Statue of Liberty, welcomes your tired and your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores,the homeless, tempest tossed. These in fact are the people who built America. Some of them were working in the Twin Towers the morning of September 11, 2001, earning a better life for their families. I've been told that the World Trade Center victims were from at least 30 other countries, cultures, and first languages, including those that aided and abetted the terrorists.     So you can try to kill an American if you must. Hitler did. So did General Tojo, and Stalin, and Mao Tse-Tung, and every bloodthirsty tyrant in the history of the world. But, in doing so you would just be killing yourself. Because Americans are not a particular people from aparticular place. They are the embodiment of the human spirit of freedom. Everyone who holds to that spirit, everywhere, is an American.  -- Author unknown  Pass this around the World   urlLink Blogroll Me!

      Well, if you are a regular reader of my blog, which I don't think there are THAT many; then you know that last Friday I had plans to attend a funeral of a friend of mine that drowned in the local lake. I was dreading going to the funeral, as would any non-morbid person. Of course, my best friend and her boyfriend  were not ready at the time we had discussed, so we all show up about 10 minutes before the funeral starts. I do not like being late, especially to something like that where there is limited seating and everyone in the building turns around to see whose coming in the door. I felt like we were on display as we walked in. But, at least we made it there before the funeral began.  Funerals are bad enough as it is, but even worse when the death is unexpected. And even worse when the person is young. We all stood as the pall bearers brought the casket in and the family followed. The sight of the casket and knowing that my deceased friend's physical remains were in there immediately started the waterworks. The family was seated in the front of the church and when the preacher spoke her first words which were something to the effect of,"We are going to miss Travis Niles" the family just let all of their emotions out. Screaming, crying, heaving, you name it and that is what was going on at the front of the church. This made it one hundred times worse. I had never attended a black funeral previously, and this was all new to me. I suppose it is healthy to not suppress any emotions and just let it all out.  When the service was complete, everyone stood again and the casket was carried back out. The family then followed, but then his mother fainted just before she reached the front door. Then his brother dropped to his knees and screamed, "Why my brother?" Needless to say, this was by far the MOST vocal and dramatic funeral I have ever been to. I hope his family comes through the grief knowing that he is in a better place, and I hope Trapp is safe in heaven if there is such a place.   urlLink Blogroll Me!

      I have found out the truth (or what of it I could at this point) about my friend's death.  One of my patient's works for DNR, and I asked her to PLEASE find out any information that she could regarding the circumstances of his death. Well, as you may know, gathering tidbits of information from numerous individuals mimics the game telephone. Anything you hear and the final statement is convulated to say the least.  I found out that there are NO signs of foul play whatsoever. The party was Saturday night, not Friday night, and it was evident that he died simply from drowning. A bunch of people had taken a pontoon from the house where the party was to a lakeside bar called Dockside. They continued drinking heavily and on the way home Trapp asked if he could drive the boat. They said no because he was so fucked up. I guess when they arrived back at the house or at some point he wanted to leave but could not find his keys. He wandered off alone and that was it. The next thing anyone heard of him he was floating face down in the lake.  Sunday, the people of the house needed to get out of the driveway and his Tahoe was in the way. Trapp had left his keys in someone's car by accident, and that person came with the keys to move the vehicle so it was no longer blocking the driveway. Everyone thought he was either shcacked up with some stripper somewhere or some girl in general I suppose, or that he had gone in another car with someone else.  My take on it is that he probably walked down to the lake ALONE, stepped of the dock or slipped into the water by accident, freaked out because he could not touch and could not swim, and drowned. His BAL was .27.  I am still upset, but feel somewhat better knowing that he was not murdered.   urlLink Blogroll Me!

      Well, today is the day that a slew of my friends and myself mourn the death of Travis Niles-whom we referred to as Trapp. If you are new to this blog and have not skimmed any previous posts, Trapp was a friend of mine that died this past weekend. His body was found floating Monday morning in the local lake. The conditions surrounding his death are evidently strange and I am not the only one in thinking that they point directly to foul play. Also, I found out that he had three children; not just the daughter as I had previously thought. His other two children live with their mother and I doubt that he was as close to them as he was the daughter I mentioned before.  Today is going to SUCK! It will definitely be a whose who of people in our town...which mind you is not very big to begin with. I was born here in Columbia, SC but was raised in Australia and Atlanta. I am still getting used to the confined span of this small city after two years. Anyway, a friend of mine said that she would not be surprised if cops were there since foul play is suspected at this point. They always say murderers can't stay away...either they go back to the scene of the crime or the funeral.     urlLink Blogroll Me!

      Is it just me or is the air we breathe being consumed by some who should be shot so the rest of us can have more oxygen to feed our brains? sometimes I think it is too bad that we can not just murder the useless.

But just for future reference to anyone who has a brain and is a mature specimen of our species...when someone says they are going to ignore you don't keep commenting on that blog trying to get a rise out of that person. If you continue to comment, you have no basis WHATSOEVER of accusing the individual that you have been taunting of immaturity.

      Things just are not adding up. In the past two days all sorts of different stories have been flying around about what actually caused his death. First, I heard he was shot. Then someone brought up the possibility that maybe he was on a boat with someone, fell off into the water and drowned, causing the people he was with to freak out and dip without saying anything to anyone.  Maybe it is just me, but why would he even be in a boat with a bunch of inebriated crazies when he did not even know how to swim? And, if he was shot, don't you think the paper would have stated that instead of stating that the only conclusions drawn from the autopsy regarding cause of death was drowning? Someone please give me an outside opinion on this, because when people have an emotional attachment to an individual they are less likely to think rationally?  That funeral tomorrow will be weird as shit...especially since a lot of his friends (including myself) are POSITIVE that foul play was involved.   urlLink Blogroll Me!

      Police claim that Mark Hacking confessed to killing his pregnant wife, Lori. When Mark was a patient at a psychiatric hospital, he admitted to another patient that he had murdered his wife with a knife as she slept.  Yesterday police released a video from a convenient store showing Mark Hacking shortly after the time officials think he killed Lori. The video shows Hacking checking his hands, not making eye contact with other patrons of the store, and pulling something out of his watch. Officials also said that a knife with Lori's blood on it was found in the apartment, and her blood was found on the headboard of the  couple's bed. Hacking told the witness at the psychiatric hospital that after killing Lori, he dumped her body in a dumpster.  I knew this asshole killed his wife, and I hope his karma comes swiftly and causes him as much pain as he caused Lori and his unborn child. Fucking weirdo!   urlLink Blogroll Me!

      It was about 6:30 yesterday afternoon and I had my purse in hand ready to walk out the door. The phone began to ring and I was having an internal debate on whether or not to pick it up. Something told me to get it-I needed to. It was my friend Teia, calling to tell me that out friend Trapp had been found early that morning floating in the lake. He had drowned at some point over the weekend and his body washed up behind someone's home in Ballentine-a small lakeside town with mostly residential lake property.   Initially, I was shocked. She told me that someone out there had a party on Friday night, someone took Trapp's keys from him because he was too drunk to drive, and no one saw him after that until his body was found in the lake early Monday morning. This all seemed a little strange to me in retrospect after the intial shock wore off enough for me to actually logically think about the situation.  You see, Trapp was not a stupid person. It is not like he would have gone swimming by himself if he was intoxicated in any manner. So, the only thing that I could think was that he got pissed because someone took his keys (he never stayed in the same place for very long on a weekend night) and wandered off by himself. At that point, he possibly fell and hit his head and was unconscious by the time he hit the water. Or at least something like that.  But, even that seemed weird...like it was not the correct explanation. Today I found out that the police found his truck, windows down, keys in it, and his wallet in the truck parked close to the site of the party.  There is no way in hell he would have left his wallet in the truck and the keys in the ignition. No way! If anything, he would have locked everything in the truck and taken the keys with him. This new little tidbit of information makes me think that someone did something to him...almost like he was lured out of the truck or something. And then there is no telling who was at that party, and why he was alone if he had gotten his keys back. Obviously he had the intention of leaving the party, but I know he did not ride out there alone. Someone had to ride with him...and I find it very strange that no one talked to him since Friday night at the party and no one found it weird that they had not heard from him the rest of the weekend.  I will keep an update going on this post, just in case any of you are interested to see what the final determination is...please say a prayer for my friend and his family. Especially his little girl, whom is now left without a father.   urlLink Blogroll Me!

      Have you ever made a direct comment to someone respectfully requesting something when someone else chimes in and shares their unwanted view? I really hate it when that happens. It makes me happy that I do not own a gun, and it also makes me happy that this particular person's only interaction with me is via the internet.  Why is it that certain people just love to argue? It is not like they are arguing for some profound reason, but simply because they have NOTHING better to do with their time.  You know, there are some people who have their little list of blogs that they visit, and when a topic arises that peaks that individual's interest they more than likely will post a comment before going on with their life. Then there are other people whose existence thrives on blogs, this is the only happiness that they know because for some reason or another they have been cast aside by the TANGIBLE world around them. I think it is hyterical...call me a bitch or whatever but I do think it is hilarious. What a sad life that must be. Some people have problems with food and wake up in the middle of the night yearning for a snack, but the abov mentioned type of person wakes up in the middle of the night thinking of the next comment they are going to post. If you spend the majority of your day on the computer surfing your respective list of blogs, I am sorry if this offends you. However, if your use of blogs is purely recreational when you have nothing else to do or may be bored, then you know what I am talking about. Let me put it this way, if someone directly speaks to you then you have every right to comment. Otherwise, stay the fuck out of it. If you can't stand that someone called you out when you have been harping on the same fucking topic for a motherfucking week and you happen to disagree with the fact that it has become extremely boring and because of the issue being discussed for so fucking long the majority of readers have lost every ounce of interest, then you need to get a fucking psychiatric exam. You also need to acquire a backbone and be able to understand that whatever may stimulate your mind stimulates very few other minds. What the fuck ever! I really can't stand some people, but all you can do is just say "FUCK IT" and go on with your life and be thankful that you have one outside of Silicone Valley.   urlLink Blogroll Me!

      Aaaaaagh! I never thought I would say this, but thank God it is Monday and I am back at work. I normally write about meaningful topics, but I just have to vent. This is my blog so I can do that if I want to. Anyway, my friends are getting married next weekend. All of the women folk took a weekend trip to the beach for my girl's bachelorette party. Okay, maybe it was not such a bright idea to make it a weekend thing, or maybe it was the maturity level of a couple of people who went. There were seven of us who are friends and hang out a lot. The other two involved NEVER hang out with any of us other than the bachelorette. One girl was her best friend  (from this point on she will be referred to as "friend") and the other was her cousin (from this point on she will be referred to as "cousin"). Obviously "friend" and my friend have taken two totally seperate turns on the personality highway if you catch my drift. She was very miserable the entire time, jealous and just making little jabs at a couple of the girls all weekend, and hardly ever smiled. The "cousin" was overweight, seemed to have not been out much and very sheltered, and very much wanting to impress the rest of us girls. She obviously thought that there was only one type of low carb, high protein diet. I think the only one she had ever heard of was the Atkins Diet because she got into an argument with me about it. She said that on the low carb diet you can eat cheese. I told her, "Yeah, on Atkins you can eat cheese, bacon, whatever-just no carbs. Like, if you get a sandwich you don't eat the bread and in general limit your carbs." She did not get that there were different variations of the low carb diet, so I just gave up in the midst of her screaming and said,"What the fuck ever.I don't care." Then we all went out Saturday night to a club called Kryptonite and she was actually trying to wear tennis shoes...what kind of club lets you in wearing tennis shoes. Not any I have ever been to. The "friend" was trying to make me feel sorry for her at the club. I asked her why she was not drinking and she said,"If I buy a drink I can't feed my baby all week." I guess she thought I would be like "Oh I'll buy you one you poor thing" but I did not. I just told her to get a dude to buy her drink...she said her husband would not appreciate it. I told her he should have given her more money then. Next time there is a bachelorette party, someone please remind me to get my own room. Nine bitches in a condo with two bedrooms and two baths does not work-especially when two of them are weird as hell. Actually, if those two were eliminated from the equation there would have been no drama I am sure.   urlLink

      I knew it! I knew this guy killed his wife. Police arrested Mark Hacking, the husband of the missing pregnant Salt Lake City woman, this morning for aggrevated murder. Mark was arrested about 11:00 this morning Salt Lake City time. For the past couple of weeks, Mark had been in a psychiatric facility after police found him running around his hotel parking lot naked.  It was quite obvious (to me at least) that Mark Hacking was guilty of killing his wife.  If you ever taken the time to read the timeline of events leading up to and after her disappearance, you would have thought he was guilty from the get go as well.  Basically, the week before her disappearance Lori was very upset after receiving a phone call at work from UNC Chapel Hill telling her that her husband had not been admitted to medical school there. Lori was under the impression he had been and that the couple would shortly be moving to North Carolina. After her disappearance, police found out that contrary to what everyone (including Mark's parents) thought, Mark never even graduated from the University of Utah. Mark would leave books open all over the apartment to give Lori the impression that he was studying all of the time. Police found out that the majority of his time was spent at a store close to their home drinking, smoking, and playing cards. Mark had asked the owners and other patrons to never tell Lori that he smoked because they were Morman and Lori was very much against smoking. The morning her disappearance was reported Mark was seen buying a new mattress. He then called family and friends a good hour before he contacted police to report her missing. Over this past weekend, the family held a press conference stating that they had learned new information regarding Lori from Mark and asked that any searches for her cease.  Like I said before, I knew it. I just feel awful for her and her family. Maybe Mark was watching all of this coverage of the Peterson trial and thought it was worth a shot to try the same thing. If there was any doubt in my mind before that he had not been involved in her disappearance, which there was not, but had there been it would have stopped today as soon as I found out that he told the family something to make them call off the search for Lori.    urlLink Blogroll Me!
