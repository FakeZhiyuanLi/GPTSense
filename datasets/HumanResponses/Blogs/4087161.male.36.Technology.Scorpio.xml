						    AggCom™ unveiled.  In a recently held press conference at Delhi’s India Habitat Centre a spokesperson for well known ad agency HAT unveiled the revolutionary new brand building strategy that will change the nature and impact of advertising in the years to come. In what is termed a “talk thru” in HAT speak, the person revealed to the assembled journalists and economists how the new technique was a synergistic coming together of traditional culture and market forces. "It is the first of a new breed of cross paradigm products that we are in the process of creating", the spokesperson explained adding that this was the first ever usage of the concept of a paradigm bridge. Compassion has always been integral to our culture and has been identified as one of eight KDCs or key defining characteristics of our culture. Similarly aggression is a KDC of the newer, emerging culture. The weight of the two characteristics (which is measure of their influence on their context) is close enough for paradigm bridging to offer itself as a possible product strategy, resulting in AggCom™ – the latest strategy to hit the market. In a pilot brand building exercise for a well known software solution provider that recently went public, it was clearly demonstrated that in regions where AggCom™ was used, the oversubscription was about 15.4 times as opposed to other regions where the oversubscription was a mere 5.6, “We are satisfied with HAT and with AggCom™ and are considering using a similar approach for our future brand building efforts” the CFO is quoted as having said. A well known manufacturer of soft drinks also endorses AggCom™ in the light of the near drought crises effecting some northern states. “Our hearts were filled with compassion for the near drought stricken, we wanted to aggressively reach out to them, and thanks to AggCom™.” Adopting AggCom™ enabled us to create our new sookha-cola brand. One bottle of the now premium drink was provided to each defame (drought effected family member) per day for the duration of the near drought condition.   Responses to AggCom™  The advertising industry at large has endorsed AggCom™ as a revolutionary new strategy that will change the face of advertising for all time to come. The stock markets are equally upbeat about it, indeed HAT stocks are well into their second day of a strong bull run. The social sector has viewed this development with concern. Well known social activist Boral Mully of the organization formerly known as Paheli – questions for women – in a public statement said “CompAgg is a well known and documented strategy that feminists have used and passed on in the oral tradition to deal with an inherently aggressive patriarchal society. We have always protested against corporate co-option of traditiono-cultural tools, and are shocked and astounded at this blatant corporate plagiarism.”   Beneath the covers  Our special GROINS (Group of Indian News Services) correspondent with his unerring nose for a story decided to explore this interaction between the advertising and the NGO / Social service industry. Accompanying him was our trainee correspondent from New York. So without further ado, its over to our special GROINS correspondent.
