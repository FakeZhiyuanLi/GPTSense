       Glad to b at hm now.  Always rushin to go hm.  I jus cant stand a min outside.  Horrible!!!  Surfin e net rite nw n is kind of bored.  Jus thot of findin somethin interestin to do.  Jus dunwan to b left out of tis world.  Growin fatter as days passed.  Hate it bt always no determination to get my VERY OWN slimmin program start.  Y m i doin tis to myself???? Arrggghhh....  Ruinin my life in tis way isnt tat great thing to talk about.  I wan a previous mi which weighs not more than 50kg, a complexion not tat bad (always due to my breakouts! DAMN it) and a well tone and contour body.  I dun nit to b slim bt I wan to hv a healthy body n weight!!!! Can i do it???  Lets c about tat....!  Always indulge myself wit good food hw to slim down???? hMM.... Guess it takes a long time to change my diet... Haha... due to my wound, I cant reali exercise.  I enjoy skipping at hm but now cant do it.  Arrggghhh.... M i talkin nonsense here??? Kind of. Guess for tonite's program is study till 9pm watch my Channel 8 drama then, relaxxxx sia.... then sleep!!!!  Everyday like tat sure lost touch to the outside world.... Always stayin in my own world (my SECRET garden).  Friends are al attached except mi.... Aren't they fortunate???  No choice cos I'm UGLY FATTY Stella...!!@@@@@  Bt I c no point to envy them.  They hv their own worries for each other, quarrels, trusts n all tat stupid idiotic things. SuckZ....  Y get myself into al tis???  I m happily pamperin myself after ended tat horrible relationship I had.  I tink I beta learn to love myself first b4 lovin someone else.  My RElationship's door is shut till further notice.  Will not open for tis 2yrs or more....  Fate will decide for mi when I should open... Great to isolate myself.  Jus wish to pick up back al my interests from young till now.  My piano, swimming, badminton, nice puzzles, cross stitches.  Kick away once n for al my bad habits.  Smoking, drinking (wine la. gd for health. nt those liquor n beers. Hmm I guess e liquors I hv can put aside liao!! haha), clubbing (bt once a while can la, bt always go there liao feel sleepy lei!!! kenA scold by frens).  Ok tats al for today.  Study nw...

         Hmm... Wat a day!!!  My Sundays are nv d same like before.  Lonely, al by myself.  Bt I like it.  I dun nit to care hw others wil tink of mi or anything else.  I am myself and not for anyone.  Lazin around e hse for the whole day.  Surfing the net al e time, not forgetting to catch the Table Tennis Bronze Medal Match.  Haiz... Wat a pity tat Li Jiawei lose!! :(  Bt glad to see other matches like badminton which our neighbouring country, Indonesia win the Gold Medal and China winning the Gold medal in the Gold Medal Match in Table Tennis.  Feel great!!!  Bt after watching, there are lots of thoughts.  Singapore is stil not up to the standard for matches in a big sport event.  Jus hope al the players could jus keep it up and get something back in the next Olympic Games.  Hmm... So sad gt a pimple popping out.  Tat's so bad for mi.  I guess now I goin back to study my up coming exams in Nov.  So happy tat I have enrol my LCCI course which start next Sun...  Glad tat everything is fine rite nw after my suffering from the surgery I had on my hand and illness.  I'm Okay now!!!  (o'_'o)
