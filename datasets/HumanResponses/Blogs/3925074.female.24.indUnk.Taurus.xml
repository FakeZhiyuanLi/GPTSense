      hello! allison and i are still doing well. we are going to be leaving for salvador on sunday, a 26 hour bus ride. we still are meeting people daily who are incredibly nice and helpful and we are getting confused less and less. however, i am realizing more and more that we are consistently getting ripped off when taking taxi rides. then after charging us an exorbinant amount they drive away saying ´vai com deus´ or `go with god`. i guess that is to be expected, but it doe~sn´t make it feel any better on my wallet! i am kind of getting used to everyone staring at us because we´re the whitest people around , and every other man whistling and whispering telling us we´re beautiful gringos, and homeless and disabled children begging for a bite of our food or for money for food. but on to the more positive!  we are trying all kinds of new and exciting foods that i wish i could bring back for everyone! today we had acai, a amazonian fruit that is dark purple, almost black, that is frozen and then blended and served in a bowl. better than any ice cream or sorbet i have ever had. we also have tried a ground cooked corn product that is sweetened and wrapped in corn husks and sold on the street. excellent. also, yucca root is cooked in many different ways and is always good, boiled, fried, baked...mmm. despite all of the attractions though, i am very excited to arrive in salvador and see all of the people i met the last time i was there. also, i think my lungs could definietly use a break from all of the pollution here. i will write again once i am in salvador! i love you all, monique ps. ja, muttichen, die frauen hier rasieren alles. und jeder gooked uns immer an, aber ich glaube es ist weil wir so weiss und kommish aus sehen. ich liebe dich und hoffe das ihr spass gibt bei gieselas! fondu!! oh la la!

      today we visited christ, he seems to be doing well:) naturally, it was beautiful. we finally found a really good restaurant last night, one that does not try and sneak ham in everything, like our previous dinner experiments. i am speaking portuguese more and more, but i still do not know the names of all of the food. mom, you would be really impressed with all of the beautiful cakes here. last night i had a passionfruit cake, mmm.  alos, last night allsion and i were walking down the street, when we noticed that for some reason, all of the cars had stopped driving and everyone in the city was crowded around a tv somewhere, and then....screams and cheers from all over the city, and this city is huge, because brazil had just won the south american cup, against argentina, and barely. so that is why cars were left open and running in the streets with no one in them! CRAZY! thanks to everyone for writing comments! they are really nice to get! love,monique

      allison and i safely made it to rio de janeiro! we had a surprise stop in sao paulo but found our hostel quickly and got settled in. i have already accidentally eaten ham. everyone is very nice and wants to practice their english with us.&nbsp;tonight we are going to a `forro` dance class. it has been really really cold here. very&nbsp;unusual we are being told.&nbsp;women here all wear really big heels. but we have found some&nbsp;crazy looking shoes that i might just have to buy. tomorrow we are going to attempt to climb `pao de acucar`` or ``´sugarloaf mountain`´&nbsp; that should be fun. that is all for now!!!&nbsp;

      we have settled in really well. i now am remembering why i love this place. my capoeira family here has welcomed everyone. i feel more alive here than anywhere in the world. the people here are so friendly, take there time doing everytihng, are take care of each other. it is nice to feel like i have a family here when i am in such a foreign place. here, if one person in a group of 10 has a drink, everyone will get some of that drink. and the same goes for everything thing. the other day me and two other people from the states took 7 kids out for dinner and it only costs us about 20 dollars total and they were so  happy. one got a sunday and made everyone take a bite first and then he allowed himself to take a bite too. i feel so special to be able to be and learn in such an amazing place. people here are always singing too. everyone knows songs, no matter what the age. everyone plays instruments and sings and laughs all the time. next week i am goingto go scuba diving with some brazilians. i love this place and these people!!!!!!

      wow. i am not on a bus anymore. i wasbeginning to think i was stuck in a dream. so allison have finally made it to salvador, only 3 people vomited, one person shat their pants, and 27 hours later, we have met with my instructorm, his children, and more people from our group. it feels so good to be here with the brazilian group.  despite being incredibly poor and having much more difficult of lives than people in the US, these people are always cracking jokes and happy to talk and laugh and hug everyone. everyone is a comedian, and they all laugh at the smallest, simplest things. it can be such a relief sometimes when you think you have totally embaressed yourself but eveyone jsut laughs and moves on. we have moved into our apartment and settled in a bit. it is below my instructors parents house and came with a guard dog, although a few times i have felt that the dog is guarding the house from me:) wednesday will be my first day of training, i am already a bit nervous. even just one week feels like months, plus these people are incredibly talented! we´ll see.  i hope everyone is doing well and thank you for writing comments!  ps. one nice thing about learning languages is that you can say embarrasing things without too many people knowing what you´re talking about!!...
