       urlLink    Lookie! Elven swamp rangers riding ram horned dragons! Ok wow, the idea sounded alot cooler in my head about a month ago when I sketched it. Now it just looks like a half-assed Magic card illustration.&nbsp; urlLink

       MOOD: SKETCHY  MUSIC: WHITE ZOMBIE AND ROB ZOMBIE SONGS     &nbsp;   &nbsp;I'll give it to you straight. I have an obsession with cartoons... American. Japanese. Classic. Modern. Traditional. Computer Generated. I love it all. I'm not sure if its what I want to do, but when&nbsp;I get into one of these moods I feel as if I do. My favorite digital artist of all time is and probably will stay  urlLink Bengal . And of course I love  urlLink Craig Mullens' stuff ...    &nbsp;But returning to cartoons. My current artist obsession is the amazing cartooning of  urlLink Steven Silver . The name may not be familiar but does either Kim Possible or Clerks the Animated Series ring a bell. Yea, his art friggin rocks the house. Even Gabe of  urlLink Penny Arcade  fame, cites Mr. Silver as one of his greatest influences. All day I've been looking through Stevens portfolio. Examining his sketches. Emulating them to the best of my talents and just really picking them apart. His Kim Possible sketches really stand out as a high point. Not to mention his wonderful caricature work. I know, I should really create my own style&nbsp;but hey, isn't imitation the highest form of flattery?    &nbsp;Keeping on the subject of art, this is kind of just a reminder for me. I really need to pick up a copy of  urlLink Flight . I've been wanting to. I really need to go to the Lafayette comic shop. If&nbsp;I can find&nbsp;the place that is...   &nbsp;Tonight or tommorow I'm gonna&nbsp;be posting some of my sketchbook stuff.&nbsp;I won't&nbsp;waste bandwith with the crap. Just the stuff I like. &nbsp;

       &nbsp;I invited my friend to join Blogger. And guess what?  urlLink She did ! Totally awsome. A link to her blog is on the right margin.  &nbsp;Well my birthday is on the 7th of August... I can't wait. God it'll be good to get out of the house. Especially since my sister's boy... friend... thing... is coming in from out of town. And guess what? He'll be in only on my birthday. I don't really want to meet him... so I'm gonna go to the mall with my friends.  &nbsp;Another awsome thing. My Dad is buying me a Wacom tablet! Woot for me, no? My random&nbsp; ugly MSPaint sketches will become random pretty&nbsp;Corel Painter sketches. Woot once again for good measure.

        [Originally posted in the  urlLink Zelda Universe  forums.] &nbsp;    &nbsp; edit:&nbsp;OoT=Ocarina of Time, LttP=Link to the Past, AoL=Adventure&nbsp;of Link... Sorry for my&nbsp;geekdom. As if anyone reads this.    &nbsp;Barring the Oracles and Four Swords I've at least played a small bit of every Zelda game. Some more than others. I can't choose a favorite. I just can't if you told me, "Hey let's go play Zelda!" I would be equally excited to play a Zelda game regardless of the title. Even the bad apple of the series AoL, holds a special place in my heart. I can't bring myself to play the damn thing because I hate it's gameplay, but I still remember it as my first Zelda experience. That's right. Not OoT, not LttP, Ao-friggin-L. And I must say I'm glad that it did not ruin my experiences with my next Zelda game: LttP.    &nbsp;Truthfully, when I beat LttP, it was tagteam playing afterschool with an older Zelda player. Mostly when I would take the controller, he would be helping me along through the dungeons. I loved fighting the Armos Bosses. And I when we first got the Master Sword... We had Link walk through tons of enemies like a total bad-ass. Something about wielding a sword forged of pure anti-evil has a very empowering effect. My friend ended up beating Ganon for me, and I can still vividly remember watching the ending movie to it. A truly great moment in gaming.    &nbsp;Links Awakening... I can remember the first time I successfully stole an item from the shop. I know, not the most epic of feats but I was so young when I played it, I never really got past the first dungeon.    &nbsp;Ocarina, I am sad to say, is ranked high on my Zelda quality list but I never actually made it past the Water Dungeon. I was playing on a borrowedcopy and I just could not beat it. (This was before I had fully discovered the glory of the internet.) And I have only played mere minutes of Majora's Mask. Though I do plan to obtain a copy of this and Ocarina for Gamecube. I know I can find that somewhere...    &nbsp;Legend of Zelda (original) just has that appeal to me. I have no idea why. I never owned it. I have only played the rom of it. I just love it. I need a Gameboy Advance SP Classic so I can dream of what could have been if only this had been my first Zelda...Ah and Wind Waker. My current Zelda love... I just love how the first part of the story is very linear. You're told where to go, what to do... And then it just breaks off into full on exploration of this massive world. I don't care if its just a few islands. This is the best illusion of a truly massive world I have seen in a Zelda game. And maybe its because I have watched some of the One Piece anime, but sailing up to a monster manned craft and totally pirating their place on the high seas never gets old for me. I'm still playing through this excellent adventure (Bill and Ted reference not intended... no wait I take it back, yes. Intended)    &nbsp;I guess its just a roundabout way of saying that I too enjoy the Zelda series as just that. A series of truly amazing games. I just can't pick a favorite.

       Random Song: Pink Floyd - Another Brick in the Wall   Mood: Bored... -ish.   &nbsp;Well, Saturday night and I've been at home. Well actually earlier I was at a restaraunt with the family. But now I'm sitting here. Rambling on in the blog, watching a Jaws marathon on tv but only half interested because its one of the crappy sequels. Me and my Dad talked about our usual late night subjects. Making fun of whatever is on tv. Current politics. Making fun of current politics with history references. I like that about my Dad. He could be the coolest history teacher ever because his mind is just full of information. He knows this but he rathers just to be (self-described)&nbsp;"off-shore oil field trash."&nbsp;   &nbsp;I've been thinking about what I wanna do with my life. Being an artist&nbsp;someday I mean. I can't help but feel I'm being selfish about it. I mean, most of my friends wanna be EMTs, doctors, forensic scientists. Real interesting stuff plus all these things help people. They wanna be these things because they want to help people. I just feel selfish just wanting to be an artist just because I want to. What good am I to other people. Great... now I'm getting depressed.   &nbsp;Hm, ok. My website pick of the day is  urlLink Questionable Content . Just a really funny emo-ish webcomic about a guy and his lovelife. Oh yea, and he has a robot computer with a really bad sweet-tooth... Right. Also, my music for the night is stuff by  urlLink Bright Eyes  and  urlLink Weezer  (Mostly Pinkerton album songs).   &nbsp;Ok that about does it for tonight. My Dad is buggin me to get some sleep. Good for my face he says. Oh yea I forgot. I got an infected ex-zit that made my face swell up. Fun!

       MOOD: NEUTRAL    MUSIC: ROB ZOMBIE - "GO TO CALIFORNIA"       &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Ever eat  urlLink wasabi ? Quite a rush isn't it? Its a hard feeling to describe. Ever see a work of art that&nbsp;gives the feeling&nbsp;that you're inside it?&nbsp;Or see a movie that makes you feel totally and utterly alive.&nbsp;Perhaps you've heard a song that reassured that yes, love does exist, life does have meaning, that people are for the most part good. &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;Wasabi a bit scary. You know that&nbsp;eating it will burn your mouth and water your eyes, but&nbsp;tasting that, you want to eat even more.&nbsp;You know that waking up each morning invites dozens of mishaps mistakes and pains that come with each day. But just staying in bed will deprive you of life. I guess what I'm trying to say is, live life. Take the good with the bad and hope the good outweighs the bad.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;This place, this blog, will be my escape. Not just some place to bitch about how horrible life is to hundreds of strangers who could care less. Instead, I have resolved to glorify life. Through art, writing, and anything else, I'm going to figure out life. We were not meant to be given all of the answers to life. Nor were we destined to wander aimlessly for our entire lives. I refuse to run away, I refuse to ignore life. I'm going after life. Examine, probe, and dissect life. And record the results. Always record.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;--End Post--
