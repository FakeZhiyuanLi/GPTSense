       Why is it when the suns out, we have this obsession with trying to light dead, burnt wood and cook things in the garden? Especially when 10 feet away, there's a decent cooker that will do things so much better.  Yes, had a BBQ today. Well it was sunny.  Went to Skoda garage, was full of old folk. So didn't get one. Somehow ended up in a Ford garage and got a Focus ST170. I'm not a big fan of the Focus, but this one seems OK. Not a bad deal, ex-demo £9999, 8700 miles. I get it Thursday.

        I've ordered Counter Strike:CZ just so I can play the new Counter Strike beta. Only cost me £12.99 from Play.com, so I'm sure it will be worth it. I'm sort of playing Doom 3. Play for about 10 minutes at a time. There's something about it that I just don't like. It's very samey and makes me jump a lot, but that doesn't really make a good game.     It's 8.20 am on a Saturday now. That's very early for me, but I was knackered last night, so I went to bed early. Today looks like it will be a busy day. Alex needs back to school shoes, off to look at cars and need to get into the loft to sort out old skiing stuff (may be going at Xmas).  Only 3 things to do today, but that will turn into loads more when it doesn't rain and I have to cut down the conifers (not a favorite job of mine).  Saw some of the Olympics for the first time this week. Not a big sports fan, specially when loads of them cheat. I'd like to see, 'who's got the wrong trousers on ?' competition, around the Olympic sized swimming pool, just like in Hi-De-Hi.

        Remember those jokes? Well I do and I never thought I'd ever want a Skoda. My cars done 90,000 miles and is worth next to nothing and now I need a new one.  So I'm thinking I've getting a Skoda   only now the difference between a Skoda and a skip is 0-60 in 7.9 secs and 180BHP   and really, it's a VW.  Well I don't just want any Skoda, I want the Skoda Octavia 1.8l 20V Turbo RS. Never know, I may even get one.  Alex and Ann are back tomorrow. It's been very strange being on my own. Oh Well, normality here I come.

        If you don't watch 'Waking the Dead' then this will make no sense, however, if you do watch it, will it make any sense either?  They killed off   urlLink Mel!    I have to say I was shocked, I never read any newspapers or magazines, so I didn't know it was coming. Nice exit though.  I had to clean out the rabbits.

        Sunday always feels like a Sunday. Don't know why that is. When I was much younger, Sunday meant nothing much to do, no shops open, pubs open for a nano second and TV was Sunday Night at the London Palladium. Now thank god, places are open and it's pretty much like the rest of the week, but TV still sucks (I did watch Waking the Dead, I like that).  Went to the pics and saw I, Robot. I liked it. Although I watched far too many trailers, it didn't spoil the film for me. Special effects were very good, hard to spot what is and isn't real. I'm guessing that a 1000 robots running about was CGI.  Decided to learn Flash again. Don't know why, just for something to do. It was either that or Visual Studio .Net and I can't think of anything I'll do, if I learn how to use that.  Work tomorrow *groan*    Oh and rabbits still alive.

        Not much has happened today, in my life anyway. I put a washing line post in the ground and spent most of the day either watching TV or on PC.  I did go to ATS and find out that my car probably needs new exhaust manifold. I think that part also has the catalytic converter on it as well. Now you know when parts for you cars have many syllables, the price goes way up for them.  Watched Identity tonight. Can't work out if I liked it or not really. I guess it was OK, but could do better. I'm sure there are people that will think it's a masterpiece, but it's not.

        Friday the 13th, unlucky for some, so I hear. How does that work exactly? Not at all I think, some people have good things and bad things happen all the time to them.    So my bad luck today, was finding out that I need an operation on my nose to make my nasal passage bigger (have trouble breathing through it). However, the good luck is that it's on the NHS and I've got to wait 6 months.  Saw The Chronicles of Riddick tonight. Top film if SciFi is your thing. Well, was loads better than the Tesco chili con carne I had.      Internet access has been playing up lately. I'm with Telewest Blueyonder. They say all is well, I beg to differ. Anyway a man will be fixing it tomorrow, sometime between 8 am an 11 am, so I have to get up early and it's a Saturday.

        Turned my PC on this morning, booted up as normal and once I'd logged in, I noticed an new icon in my taskbar. This icon was a bad icon, said my raid mirrored drives had failed   So all day I'm thinking that my PC is running on one drive and I've got to take my PC apart and get the drive out, send it off for repair, wait ages for a new one and re-install it. Nope, lucky me, I double clicked on the faulty drive in my raid status program and told it to rebuilt the mirror and it did.  Don't know why it failed in the first place, but I'm fairly happy it's now rebuilt. I haven't rebooted since it happened, so I'm not sure if it's going to fail again.    Didn't go to see I, Robot. My mate said he couldn't make it and I was knackered anyway from driving to the airport to drop off Ann & Alex at 3 am. So I watched some TV and now I'm on my PC. Oh and I found some smileys

        Right then, this is my first blog post.  I am really going to try and use this, but I can see it fade away with all of the other things I attempt. Not too sure what I should tell you all really, it's not going to be a diary into my life, but I may choose to leave something that's none of your business once in a while.  Today my wife (Ann) and daughter (Alex) flew off to Portugal for the week leaving me home alone. I'll have to do things that I normally just don't do, like feed the rabbits, not that I care if they die, but Alex would be gutted.  So tonight I'm off out to see I, Robot, may even leave a post about that tomorrow.  My mate leaves head office next week and last Friday they had a party day and he had his head painted like a tiger. I thought he looked like a gay tiger, you decide :) (mental note: get some smileys)
