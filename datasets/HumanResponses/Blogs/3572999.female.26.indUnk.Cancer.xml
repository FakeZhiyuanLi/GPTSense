						     An Angel walked the earth today Reigning joy on everyone A dazzling smile like a bright summers day Blinding you with all her glory Such a love for life Bubbling like freshly poured champagne  An Angel walked the earth today  Such beauty she possessed A heart of gold and hair of silk Our hearts she surely touched  As brief as her visit may have been I wish she could have stayed longer That she didnt have to leave  But like a delicate shinning star She faded into the dark night sky Our angel has returned home  She sleeps with the Blessed  No more pain No more tears  Rest well our little angel We will meet again  Written by Lylia Garrett July 2000

						     I hear the oceans thunder as it beats against the rocks,  And I wonder if forever is just another day...  Would it take a lifetime to swim the ocean blue, Would it be eternity before I see you.  It breaks my heart in half to know your far away.  If I had wings like eagles and could spread my wings  and fly, I'd have been here yesterday and today you would  be mine.  But oceans are between us, They're the wedge between our hearts.  I wish I could be there to hold you in my arms, To see your bright smiling face and your handsome boyish charms.  But fate it is against us, And the world is not our friend...  ...Because we are oceans apart.  Written by Lylia Garrett May 1999

						     She stumbles along a crowded street Without any shoes upon her feet Everybody stares her way But no one will give her the time of day  She asks for a few cents here and there Just enough to feed her child Most people look away Pretend to be interested in the simple things Anything so they dont have to acknowledge her Acknowledge her very existence  She's been ignored all of her life Not good enough to be anyones wife Just enough for a mans cheap fix Like a drug she has been abused  Why do we ignore the lonely hearted Why wont we give them a helping hand Why is it people are scared Too scared to help those less fortunate then ourselves  Maybe its because then we admit we care And to care leaves us open to our own pain  Written by Lylia Garrett June 2000

						     Eyes the shade of a deep lagoon Stare longingly into the sun A heart that once echoed with sweet love songs A soul with thousands of dreams Both lay in a heap broken and torn And my eye weeps a crystal tear  Life like a dark ominous force Strikes crippling blows at the heart Once standing tall and proud  Now hunched over like an old brooding woman  The weight of the world on her back Such a bleak outlook on life, on my future And my eye weeps a crystal tear  Gaining momentum as they stream down my face Collecting as a pool in my hands As I gaze into this watery puddle I can see deep into my eyes The very window to my soul I can see the strength like a grand oak in a storm  These crystal tears like a savior Rescuing me from the depths of despair As I see the strong hope that my heart carries I know I can make it  The healing process has begun....  ....With a Single Crystal Tear  Written by Lylia Garrett September 1999

						     I lay beaten and broken A victim of your anger A victim of your rage  I lay cursed and crushed A victim of your bitterness A victim of the words you say  I lay weak and weary A victim of your abuse Your emotional abuse I endure  I lay angry but alive Its a miracle I survive  The amount of times I wanted to take my own life  I am hurt by the things you say I am hurt by the anger you display  You hit me and you curse me You play games with my mind  But I wont accept it anymore There comes a time when I must stand  I stand tall and strong A survivor of your anger A survivor of your rage A survivor of you bitterness A survivor of the words you say A survivor of your abuse Your emotional abuse I endured  I stand tall and strong And life it does go on  Written by Lylia Garrett February 1996
