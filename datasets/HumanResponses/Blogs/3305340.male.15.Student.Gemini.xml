      Some of my most tormenting examinations have just ended. I go to Bhola's classes and the vacation batch is just about to get over. I got my test answer papers back and here  are the results: Maths test I :59.5/60 Sci. test I: 59.5/60 and Eng. test: 39.5/50. Thats pathetic still the highest at bhola's (If you round it up). Oh and by the way: Maths test II: 58.5/60. I think I should get 59.5/60 so I'll get it rechecked. Anyway, I saw the Bollywood movie Yuva and here's what I have to say:  It's a movie with great direction. The presentation is appealing but the story is senseless. It centres around the lives of three men. One is Lallan (Abhishek Bachchan) - A gangster, though his wife thinks he sells L.P.G. cylinders. Second is Micheal (Ajay Devgan) - A student leader. Third is Arjun (Vivek Oberoi) - Just a normal charming boy who flirts with every girl he meets.  A scene common to all three characters is shown first - Lallan talks to a friend about his wife. Micheal is dropping Arjun off in front of a taxi so that he can convince a girl (Kareena Kapoor) sitting in the taxi. Then we see Lallan taking out a gun and shooting Micheal three times as he (Micheal) goes forward on his motorcycle. Micheal crashes into the railing of the bridge they're on and the pale horrified, petrified, antsy, apprehensive, uptight, frightened, hysterical, terrified, terror-stricken, scared, aghast, fearful, panic-stricken, flabbergasted, shocked face of Arjun is shown. (Wasn't thast a long list of synonimic adjectives?)  Each story is then shown in detail. I'm not going to tell you the story. You'll have to see it for yourself.  Also, I found a wonderful Dragonball Z website called  urlLink  Dragonball Arena .  I also found a website for physics called  urlLink  Physics central . Isn't that cool?  There's a wonderful story of what would happen if computers started taking over the world. Its called Manna and is housed at  urlLink  Marshall Brain's Weblog .   I guess I covered up for all the time I didn't post. Till the next time I decide to post then.
