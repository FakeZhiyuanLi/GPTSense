      Well it seems like everytime something good happens it just turns on me and goes horribly wrong.  I don't understand why this always happens to me...  I just don't care anymore.  Things just don't every work out for me, and it makes me sick.  I think depression is getting th ebest of me, and I'm actually getting sick from it.  I don't know what to do anymore. The mystery of time Listen to me, carefully The mystery of time It's you and me That's all we need

         Well its been a normal day, sleeping till like 11 and then just hanging out.  I just saw Reservoir Dogs for the first time today. It is a great movie, and I recommend it to anyone that wants to see a good crime/humorous movie.  otherwise besides this, it has just been a normal day.  I had to go see my doctor, it seems like I may be getting a little better, but its a slow and long process, but any progress is good progress.  Maybe I'll final get what I want. I've been avidly  trying to make contact with her, but to no avail, I don't know maybe I just need to wait, maybe its fate I'm not sure, but id like to find out soon,   Against the grain Against the odds I'll rise and I won't trip again The dawn of a new day never looked As good as this

          I'm not sure who will read this, as I write this and time goes by.  I'm not really sure who really knows me. Most people don't know how truly depressed I am.  As time progressed so did my depression, and I eventually turned suicidal, twice I attempted it.  I never did succeed, I don't know what turned me away, I believe it was like two different people that I didn't want to do it too.  After all of this I had to go to therapy and I still go.  I don't really think it is helping me.  And to tell you the truth I think I'm getting worse than I use to be.  I just don't know what to do.  Everything I want to happen never does, so I just don't really want to keep trying.  This may come as a shock to some people, but all throughout my life I have had to hide all the pain I was going through, so I thought it was necessary to get it out in the open, before I don't get the chance to.      how do you sleep when its still alive never to deep take a look inside

      Hmph... Well as it seems that the summer draws on and nothing I want to get accomplished does, it makes me wonder why I should even care.  Well it's just one more year until I finish school, which is all I look forward too.  Wow it seems like I'm just wasting away.  I don't even know what the point of this all is anyways.  I don't really care so fuck it, maybe something will change for the better, and help me through this hell of a life.

      WHy do i bother, it is something I ask myself everyday.  I never have any luck with anything, especially when it has to do with a relationships,   it seems liek i am pursuing nothing, and for no real reason either.  I feel like my whole life is pointless and i will never truly find happiness.  Why should i not find happiness, I dont hink I'm a bad person, i help ou tothers and try to put others before myself but to know avail.  I just think that I would really be better of dead.  I want to not be depressed, but at every turning point Im pushed further away... so really why bother? You're told that you are trapped below And dark signs helped to prove You got to reach further  For what life shall provide
