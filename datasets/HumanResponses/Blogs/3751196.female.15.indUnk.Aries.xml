      i have decided that i am going to lose at least 20 pounds by the time school starts.  as of last sunday, i have lost 4!  i have been riding my bike and walking around my neighborhood, so far everything is going well.  im sick of all of my friends (that are an average of 130 pounds) calling thems selves fat when they arent and i am.  so i am going ot do something about it.  well i go back to school i hope i look different.  i dont have a problem with my self really, but a change would be good.

      i never finished that entry cuz i had to go to the store with my mom. I dont realy want to talk about it now cuz im in a better mood.  To make that long drawn out story shorter, we are most-likely going to have to move into an apartment sometime soon.  that had me all mad, but there isnt anything i can really do to change it.  the weird things is that now everyone is asking normal and im the only one still visibly freaking out because i think that people are going to come and take our house away.  but i guess this is a new day.  everyone else seems to have forgetten yesterdays issues.  the problem is they are jsut gunna get worse, and then come back and bite everyoen is the butt.  ill et over it tho.  now that im lookin back on it, i can see where everything started to go wrong.  if i would have paid more attention to some of the little things, adn didnt beg for the stupid little stuff at the store, we might not even be anywhere near the debt we are at now.  GOD! but im sure everthing weill get better.  i always does.  but after it gets better, doesnt it get worse??  im seriosuly doubting that anyone reads these.  but i guess that im glad no one does, it would be cool to get a commemnt once in a while or something.  i guess ijust started so im not expecting much.

      so i am on the phone with my kristi.  tomorrow we are gunna go to abbey's house.  its her brothers grad. party and we are going to help serve food.  melynn and kristi are both going ot be there.  i think that my dad is taking me to chicago tomorrow night so i have to leave there early.  That means i mguht not be able to write in this to much this weekend.  i want to try and do it everyday, or at least close.  anyway...a girl from our school was hit by a car a month ago and was killed.  today (or yesterday i dont rememeber) a kid from our school said that he wished it was kristi that got hit by the car and not jessica.  that stirred up a bunch of trouble cuz that is jsut wrong in the fist place. i dont really know what is going to happen with all of that.  maybe ill expalin about myself first.  i am 5'1" with brown hair and eyes.  i will be a sophmore in high school in the fall with makes me 15 years old.  i dont think there is really much else to say.  this will prolly be one of my must longest entries because i acually have time to do somthing today.  i need to get the hang of these writings.  i know that i can put what ever i want into it, but im not sure what i want in it yet.  If you have any ideas for me, leave me a comment or give me some advice. ive kept journals before, but im not sure what to write down now cuz everyone else can read it. i started an account at an online journal entry thing, blutry.com or something, but that got to complicated in setting it up and stuff.  this was pretty easy! maybe ill even find a picture to put up!

      I'm in one of my EXCEL classrooms that have at UT.  Man its usually boring, but this isnt that bad.  I think that this blog stuff might not be that bad.  But i guess we'll see.  My next class is English and then I am DONE! I have had these classes for a week, but I will be glad for when I dont have to come back anymore.  If i remember to keep up with it, then i dont think this will be to bad.  I'm trying to make a long entry but im running out of things to say.  Maybe I'll write and explain more about myself later tonight.  Tonight I have to babysit and then i have to go to a baseball game.  Ther is a good chance I wont be back until late.  All well, tomorrow is Saturday!

      I havent written in forever it seems.&nbsp; or at least 2 weeks.&nbsp; i just got back form a church camp and i was there for a week.&nbsp; i was sooo much fun!! i could write pages about all the things wee did but i think it would be easier if i jsut told the imnportant things as they pop into my head.&nbsp; i&nbsp;met 3 of&nbsp;my closes guy friends there.&nbsp;&nbsp;tony, andrew, and daniel.&nbsp; we all kissed and hugged adn said good bye well we&nbsp;left and said that we would&nbsp;never forget eachother&nbsp; and we would keep in touch...i bet i wount even hear from them&nbsp;until i go back to camp&nbsp;next year.&nbsp; &nbsp;i hope we keep in touch, but you never know.&nbsp; other then the people there, i will misst he freedom.&nbsp; we were the seniors of the camp so we did have to follow all of the rules.&nbsp; its always more fun wehn you can break rules.&nbsp; its more fun when you think your going ot get introuble though.&nbsp; we would stay up late adn dance or do what ever we cold think of.&nbsp; everyone mornig we would get up earlya dn go the breakfast, and everyone would go in your pjs.&nbsp; (that was a big deal cuz no one esle in the camp was aloud to wear there pjs out of the cabins) for our service projects we got to help put up dry wall and we built a water chapel.&nbsp; i think the water chapel will be one of the most remeber things of my week there.&nbsp; there is a creek that runs about 1/4 a mile from the main camp.&nbsp; we spent alomst 2 hours building up stones and rocks in the water so that it would stand 3 feet out the the runnung water in the shape of a cross.&nbsp; the we made seats all along the bank wth some of the flatter rocks that we could find.&nbsp; the whole thing went pretty quick seein as we ahd about 40 teens carrying rocks form all over and working together.&nbsp; the cross&nbsp; sits about 3 eet out of the water adn is 12 but 6 feet .&nbsp; i hope it is there nest year cuz i never got my camera down there to take a picture.&nbsp; i would love to put up pictures of all of my friends and teh things we did, but unfortuanetly, i dont have a working scanner or a digital camera (how low-tech is that!!) so i can only describe everything. i might be able to get one of myself, but not much more.&nbsp; anyway, a famliy memeber has been dying ot get on the computer so i guess i should get off adn be nice about it.&nbsp; right? i hope i feel motivated enough to write more tomorrow.&nbsp; after all myu cousins wedding is in a few days.&nbsp; i hope i get at least one entry in before we leave for columbus.
