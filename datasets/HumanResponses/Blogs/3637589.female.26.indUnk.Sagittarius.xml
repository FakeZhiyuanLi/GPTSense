      I could never go on a low carb diet. I am such a lazy cook that I rely -- no, depend -- on the ease of making pasta and rice dishes. On a low carb diet, I would probably starve to death from my own laziness.  So maybe it is because I cannot actually see myself living a low carb lifestyle that the whole craze boggles my mind. The speed with which restaurants and food producers have cowered to the diet astonishes me. Having low carb options at a bagel shop or a sandwich place just seems like a lost cause to me.   But that doesn't come close to ridiculousness of low carb vitamins (vitamins have carbs? who knew?) and the latest invention of Coca-Cola -- C2, a low carb, low cal Coke product. Low carb soda? This has to be a sign of the apocalypse. That this product exists is such a sign of desperation, an act of leming company.   Is anyone going to stand up to this Atkins Diet? I will. Is anyone with me?

      But if I hear one more visiting player call Cardinals fans "the best fans in baseball," I'm going to throw up. Don't these players know they're feeding the beast?

      So today The Boyfriend tells me that he was born Christian but raised Jewish and that his parents are now practicing Hindus. And I have no idea what to make of that....

      We're going to start with the loathing because there are few things I enjoy writing about more than things that annoy me.   I have lived in St. Louis for nearly four years. Frankly, I can't believe I've lasted that long. I am not from St. Louis, unlike almost everyone else who lives here (Everybody say it with me now: Where did you go to high school?), so it is with detached amusement that I have observed my new hometown. Thanks to some great friends, such as Midge and George, I have come to appreciate some of the nuances of this town and am certainly not as sour with it as I was when I moved here after not being able to find a job in some place cool like New York, DC or Chicago (oops, did I mention the C word? St. Louisans have en masse gone into corners to cry at the comparison to the Windy City).   But there are still a few things that rankle me about this place -- and they all seem to have reared their ugly heads in the last few days.   1. Cardinals fans. I am a Cubs fan, but until I moved here I did not hate the Cardinals. And, honestly, the hate has little to do with the team itself (although there's no way Albert Pujols is 24 and Jim Edmonds is a pandering prima donna). It's their fans. It's like they have nothing else to do but obsess about their team. I'm sitting in the bleachers Tuesday night for the Cards-A's game, and midway through the game, when the fans out there were nice and inebriated, they broke out into a rousing chant of "Oakland sucks." How...creative. Mind you, the Cardinals and A's had never before played in the regular season and there is no historical rivalry between the teams, so it was all fake animosity.   2. Lambert St. Louis International Airport. Easily the most aggravating airport in America. The signage is poor and contradictory, and the constant state of construction just makes it worse. I was picking up The Boyfriend -- who for these purposes will be known as The Boyfriend -- and had to drive around the terminal three times just to figure out where I could park. And I've lived here for four years.   3. St. Louis style pizza. I don't think anyone outside St. Louis has ever heard of this kind of pizza. Basically, it's a very thin crust pizza, which I like to call "nachos with toppings." It works as a finger food and might even become popular with all this low carb business going on, but please..."St. Louis-style"? St. Louis likes to brag about stuff it invented. Toasted ravioli, for example. It's breaded, deep-fried ravioli. You can't tell me that somewhere in Italy a hundred years ago, someone didn't come up with this.

      Are blogs the journal of the 21st century? Not an original thought, I know. Maybe I'm trying too hard to coin a phrase like "Camera phones are the autograph of the 21st century" (Welcome to The O.C. reference, bitch!).  And what does it say about the exhibitionist time we live in that so many people -- even ME -- are sharing their lives on the Internet, free for anyone to read? Maybe that explains the popularity of reality TV. People seem more willing to put themselves out there, and people are more willing to watch, read or listen to it.   But how real is this blog world? Last night as my friends and I were the throes of a boredom-induced blog obsession, one of my compadres -- who for these purposes will be known as George -- was having trouble coming up with a blog name. His problem? He said he wasn't interesting enough to have an online persona.   Persona is a word that implies some falseness, something that isn't quite what it appears. Is the blog me, this Screaming Imelda person, someone the real me can hide behind? Am I more free in the blog universe to say the things on my mind? (Although it would be hard for anyone who knows me to believe that there are things that I am not saying.)   The blog phenomenon fascinates me, much like message boards do. You'd be hard pressed to find a more complete form of entertainment than message boards. You don't even have to post in them to appreciate their charm. Just reading a message board can make you laugh, make you angry, make you sad, make you think, and generally make you feel like a normal person (or sometimes make you feel like a crazy person).   Right now I don't think anyone reading my rantings will be doing any of those things.

      A friend of mine, who for these purposes will be known as Midge, is addicted to blogs. Or at least they have become her latest means of passing the time. In scoffing at this particular guilty pleasure, I proclaimed that my life wasn't interesting enough for a blog. Well, look at me now. I'm putting that little assertion to the test.   This is what boredom does to me. I end up creating a blog because I've exhausted all other means of entertaining myself on another slow Monday night at the office. Emails? All sent. Favorite Web sites? All visited. Thus, I'm sharing my boredom (and boring life) with you, dear reader. Please forgive me.
