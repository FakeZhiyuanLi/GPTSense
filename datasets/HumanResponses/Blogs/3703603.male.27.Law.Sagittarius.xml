       If you're stuck in a failing marriage, President Bush has good news.  It turns out that the solution to your problems is actually a giant government program.  "The White House has proposed spending $1.5 billion over five years on training to help couples develop interpersonal skills that sustain what Mr. Bush calls healthy marriage," the New York Times reported yesterday (click  urlLink here  for the article, but I think you need a password).  To introduce this important initiative, Bush "spent an hour at the Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services Center listening to how Darla and Larry Groves, a low-income couple, turned their lives around after they had lost their jobs."  Unfortunately, it appears from the article that the Groveses actually managed to turn their lives around and save their marriage  without the help of a government program .    You, the taxpayer, may be wondering what exactly your $1.5 billion is going to pay for.  I will tell you.  "Under the president's proposal, federal money could be used for specific activities like advertising to publicize the value of marriage, instruction in marriage skills and mentoring programs that use married couples as role models."  I'm not sure what "marriage skills" are, but the advertising sounds like an excellent idea.  Marriage needs a little publicity.  I think a lot of people just need their government to tell them what a valuable thing marriage is, and then everything in their lives will be OK.

       I've been meaning to move my website off of Tripod for a while, and since I'm on vacation this week, I figured I would make the switch and do a little blogging.   urlLink My brother  likes to make fun of me for starting new websites every six months, and it is true that I have moved my site around quite a bit.  But every change has been for the better, and this one is no different.  The pop-up ads on Tripod had gotten out of control, so I had to do something.  Bear with me while I get this site up and running, then everything should be fine.

       What is the etiquette with respect to swimming near surfers?  Yesterday evening it was pretty hot here and I decided to take a dip in the ocean.  I’ve been in several times before, but always on weekends during the day, when there are no surfers and a lot of swimmers.  Yesterday, there were just a few swimmers but surfers all over the place.  I tried not to swim to close to them, partly to give them space to do what they were doing and partly because I don’t want them to crash into me.  But at one point I got pretty close to two surfers and they gave me the stink-eye (not to be confused with the “evil eye”) and then they looked at each other like, “who does this guy think he is, doesn’t he know this is our area?”  I wasn’t really scared of them, because they happened to be thirteen year-old girls.  But what am I supposed to do?  Walk a mile all the way down to the pier so I can swim where there are no surfers?  Swim out past the waves?  I’m hoping Rebecca or one of my SoCal readers can enlighten me here.

       I didn’t get to see as much coverage of the Democratic convention as I would have liked – I watched probably four or five hours, and I would have liked to watch four or five hundred hours, or however many hours there were – but I saw and read enough to make a few comments.  I  caught the last fifteen or twenty minutes of Kerry’s speech on the radio while I was driving to a recruiting dinner.  I guess it sounded fine.  Eventually I’ll read the transcript and maybe have some more analysis.  There are a couple things that bothered me, not just about Kerry’s speech but about the entire convention.  First, Kerry has this campaign slogan that goes something like “Stronger At Home, Respected In The World.”  I guess it’s an OK slogan, and I don’t want to read too much into it.  This slogan is basically telling you, first, my domestic policies are going to make us stronger as a nation, and second, my foreign policy is going to make us respected in the world.  I’m fine with the first part.  It’s totally vague and meaningless, but I think slogans are supposed to be.  Whatever he means by “stronger,” I’m sure it’s a good goal to have.  My problem is with the second part: should the goal of American foreign policy really be to be “respected in the world?”  I think a lot of crazy liberal Democrats would say yes, but not me.  If I were president, the goal of my foreign policy would be to prevent foreign terrorists from killing Americans.  Perhaps being “respected” abroad is a means of achieving that goal.  But is it really a goal in itself?  Why?  I think Israel is an instructive example.  Suppose a candidate for Israeli Prime Minister announced that the goal of his foreign policy was to make Israel “respected in the world.”  I think the average Israeli citizen would think, what the hell is this guy talking about?  Yeah, it would be nice if the rest of the world respected us, but what I’d really like is to not get blown up by a suicide bomb when I get on the bus to go to work this morning.  After 9/11, I think we ought to be thinking a little more like Israel.  We have to realize that no matter what we do, there are going to be millions of Islamic fundamentalists who want to kill us.  Our President ought to do everything he can to stop them, whether or not it results in us being “respected.”  This goes back to a huge problem I have with the Democrats, the idea that the main problem with Bush’s Iraq policy was his failure to build alliances and to go into Iraq with a broad international coalition.  Frankly, I just don’t give a damn.  This war was either a good idea or a bad one – personally, I think it was a terrible idea – and it wouldn’t have been any better or worse if we had the French or Germans with us.    Second problem with Kerry’s speech and the convention: there was theme of “help is on the way” or “hope is on the way” or something like that.  This goes to another problem I have with the Dems.  Isn’t this a little condescending?  The idea seems to be that we, the American people, are sitting at home, depressed about our pathetic lives, waiting for the Government to come in and make everything OK again (by doing something like “creating jobs” for us).  Is this really how it works?  I saw Charles Barkley on O’Reilly a while back and BOR was grilling him about all the problems in the black community, and Sir Charles said something like, “you know, Bill, most black people are not on welfare, they’re not in jail, they’re not sitting back waiting for the Government to do something for them.  They get up in the morning and go to work like everybody else.”  The Democrats just don’t see black people or white people or  any  people that way.  Having said that, I really like Kerry.  I think he gives a good speech, has good instincts, will do a good job.  I think he has run a pretty good campaign so far, and I still think he’s going to win, but it’s going to be a little closer than I expected, maybe just a few percentage points.  A couple other comments about the convention:  1.  Re: the campaign video, I thought it was pretty good, but I really hated how they try to portray him as this loving husband and father, and they don’t even mention the mother of his children a single time.  The bio they want you to see is John Kerry volunteered to be in the Army, volunteered to go to Vietnam, won a bunch of medals and purple hearts, came home, protested against the war, raised two beautiful daughters, and by the way his wife is a wonderful lady who speaks five languages.  The video mentioned at one point that he was a “newlywed” when he testified before Congress at age 27.  Gee, I wonder who he was newly wedded to.  Keep wondering!  I’m not sure what my point is here, but I just wonder what the hell is going on.  They don’t want us to know he’s divorced?  What’s the big deal?  Divorce is fairly common these days, no?  There are probably even a few swing voters who are themselves divorced?  On a more personal level, my own parents were married for like 22 years.  If my dad ran for President and they made a biographical video about him, I’d be mighty pissed off if it didn’t mention my mom a single time.  I’m sure my dad would  insist  that my mom be part of the video.  I don’t expect Kerry’s ex-wife to be up there on stage with him, but we don’t have to pretend like she doesn’t exist.  I couldn’t even tell you her name.  2.  Kerry’s daughters are good, no?  They seem like normal human beings, and when they talk about their father, they almost make  him  seem like a normal human being.  The blond one was especially effective, I thought.  By contrast, Teresa is highly overrated.  I just think she’s weird.  I have no idea why everyone thinks she’s so down-to-earth.  She’s just weird.    3.  Elizabeth Edwards talked way too fast.    4.  I loved the “controversy” over how many Americas there are.  Barack Obama (or, as Al Sharpton calls him, “Obama Barack”) gives this great speech about how we’re all in this together, one America, blue states and red states, we’re united, we’ll stand up to those who would divide us, etc., etc.  Then the next night, Edwards gets up and launches into his now-familiar (and perhaps tired) rant about how we’ve got “two Americas,” one for the have’s and one for the have-not’s, and how we have to work to improve health care and education for the people in the other America, bring jobs to their communities, etc.  Mickey Kaus suggested that maybe the Dems could compromise and say there are 1.5 Amercas, or “an America and a half,” perhaps.  5.  Speaking of Edwards, I love how he never mentions that he resides comfortably in the “rich” America.  But his daddy worked in a meeeeell, so I guess he at least understands the problems of the other America, although I’m sure he’s in no hurry to go back there.  I remember after one of the Bush across-the-board tax cuts, he had this big photo-op with “regular people” representing each tax bracket  except  the top bracket, and some reporter asked him why there’s no one from the top bracket up on the stage, and Bush says, “I beg your pardon, but I’m up here.”  Sometimes I really like Bush.

       Today is Saturday, July 31, 2004, and the time is 8:48 a.m.  I am coming to you live this morning from Power Chevrolet in Manhattan Beach.  Well, not exactly “live” because I am typing this into Microsoft Word on my laptop and shall paste it onto my website later today.  I decided to take my car in for its 60,000 mile service this morning, which Power Chevrolet is happy to perform for the low price of $400.00.  They give you a long list of things they’re going to do, but it’s all stuff like checking this and inspecting that.  They don’t actually do anything, don’t replace or repair anything.  So when you get right down to it, it’s a $400 oil change, the only difference being that at the end, they will presumably tell me I need to spend several hundred more dollars to replace and repair things.  So I’m looking forward to that.  In the meantime, I am finding this one of the more pleasant places from which to blog.  It’s very quiet, I have my own little table and chair, basically everything I need (except an internet connection).  Unfortunately, I did not bring my laptop charger, so I can only blog for the next hour and forty-three minutes.  I suppose that will be plenty.

       I just noticed that a couple people have made comments to previous posts.  (There would probably be more comments, but Soejoto's new law firm has some kind of web filter that blocks blogs in addition to the usual porn and gambling.)  I haven't had time yet to figure out how the comments work on blogspot, but according to Mitchell's comment it is not very user-friendly.  At some point I will see if I can make this easier, because I really love reading everyone's comments and I always complain about my brother's and sister's sites because it is impossible to post comments and/or the comments are impossible to read.  So bear with me on that.

       Welcome to the new site! I think I managed to stick with tripod for about a year, which is probably the longest I've ever gone without moving my website. The pop-up ads at Tripod were out of control and Tripod generally sucks. The downside of this move is that one of my nine readers, one Marjorie Nemerovski, had just figured out&nbsp;how to get to the tripod&nbsp;site, and now it's moving and it will surely take her the better part of a year to locate the new site. I can't wait for her to ask me 50 times for the URL. I will create a bookmark on her home computer, but it won't make a difference (come to think of it, I don't think I've ever seen Mom use her home computer). Or as former reader Florence Warnock once said, "I haven't been able to open it up," like my website is a strange e mail attachment or something.   Anyway, this site is very much a work in progress, and it's very disorganized right now. As soon as I post something else, this "welcome" post will be sandwiched in between a bunch of other posts, which aren't really in chron order to begin with. So just read what's here, enjoy it, stop complaining about how I never write anything anymore, and be thankful that I AM BACK!!!!

       I think it's a sign that your career as a Major League Manager isn't going very well when the team you work for fires you and replaces you with  urlLink Scrap Iron .  This raises the question, why did the Astros hire Jimy (not a typo!) Williams in the first place?  On the off-chance that things don't work out with S.I., who do they turn to next, Grady Little?

       For the last eight days, my beloved news channels have been held hostage by a dead man.  Granted, it was not just any dead man, but a former President who served two terms and, for whatever reason, makes a lot of people very emotional.  Was it just me, or was the coverage a bit excessive?  Not only was it overkill, it was, in my opinion, more one-sided than it needed to be.  Chris Hitchins stood tall, but couldn’t Fox News have dug up an American without a British accent to make the eminently defensible case that Reagan was not such a great President, not a Hero, not a Saint?  Where were Reagan’s foes from the 80s, the Congressional leaders like George Mitchell and whoever was running the House in those days?  I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I would have even liked to see Jesse Jackson once or twice.  (And with that, hell has officially frozen over…)    I have of late developed an appreciation for Reagan.  I read Peggy Noonan’s book about him (or one of her books about Reagan, the more biographical one – she wrote speeches for Reagan for like a year an a half and somehow managed to write about seven books about her time with him), which is about as objective as a book about Michael Jordan by Ahmad Rashad would be.  I even visited Reagan’s hometown once.  I didn’t mean to, but I got off the highway (I-80, I think) in Dixon, I saw some signs, and I figured what the hell, I’ll look around.  It was an interesting moment, actually.  Looking at the houses there, which were significantly less nice than the house I grew up in, it hit me that in this country, it really doesn’t matter where you come from.  Anyone can pretty much do anything.  Reagan was president from the time I was three years old to when I was 11.  At some point during that time, I decided that I would be President someday.  I wrote Reagan a letter.  I don’t think he wrote back, but he sent me a nice little booklet about the White House, which I thought was pretty cool.      I never had a strong opinion of Reagan, either for against, when he was President (neither did most eight year-olds, I suppose), and I still don’t.  There were certainly some good things about him.  His positions were clear, and he stuck to them.  He fought for tax reform and lower federal income tax rates for everyone, which means a lot to those of us crazy people who think taxes should be lower as opposed to higher.  The Tax Reform Bill of 1986 is, in my opinion, one of the most important and worthwhile pieces of legislation passed in my lifetime, and Reagan had a lot to do with it.  He showed moral clarity and courageous leadership in fighting Communism, although conservatives give him way too much credit for “winning the Cold War.”  He had a principled belief in limited government.  I think he thought the Federal Government generally screws everything up, so we might as well not give them much to do, which is more or less what I think.  He was at times an eloquent speaker.  He was funny and charming.  He made people proud to be Americans, in a way that no President since has.    At the same time, he was a rather strange man.  Noonan openly acknowledges in her book that Reagan had exactly one friend (Noonan explains that he had many other friends, but they all happened to be dead) and was generally a lousy father.  He had limitations as a President.  Much like Clinton, I think he was an effective President in his first term, but got bogged down in scandal in his second, to the point where the country would have been better off with someone else in charge.  Like many historical figures, his moment in the spotlight came too late in his life.  He might have been a great President in the 1970s, when he was younger, more idealistic and energetic (and, I suspect, did not take a three-hour nap every day – not that I’m against napping!).  I think Reagan himself sensed this, and that’s why he ran for President in 1976.   He was also, in a way, too idealistic.  He had grown up in a small town in the 1920s and 30s.  I think it was hard to convince him to care about things like racial injustice (did you notice that the people on TV last week participating in the Reagan love-fests were all, what’s the word, WHITE?), the environment, or poverty.  They were not part of his experience at all.     And with that, I think we should all go on with our lives now.

       Okay, let’s say you’re Ray Charles, and it’s June 6, 2004.  You know you don’t have much time left, but you also know that Reagan died yesterday.  You’ve got some pride, you had a bunch of hit songs, you were kind of a cool blind dude* who did some Coke commercials (or maybe it was Pepsi…), and it would be nice if they printed a few newspaper articles about you when you died.  You figure okay, if I can just hold out until Thursday or Friday, all of this Reagan crap will have quieted down, I’ll be the top story on cnn.com for at least half a few hours, MSNBC will dig up some old biography of me and run it late at night when only Nemo is watching, and everything will be cool, right?    Guess again, Mr. Charles.  This has to be one of the worst-timed celebrity deaths ever, certainly the worst since Mother Teresa decided to cash in her chips like four days after Princess Di.  I have to say, though, the folks at Fox Sports nearly made up for it this afternoon during their broadcast of the Red Sox-Dodgers game/home run derby.  During one of the many pitching changes, Joe Buck informed the viewers that “this week, we lost two legends,” and proceeded to run clips of Reagan announcing baseball games while one of Ray Charles’s way-too-long versions of “America The Beautiful” played in the background.  It was as if Reagan’s death was somehow convenient, giving Fox something to show the viewers while they listened to Ray Charles.  Only in America, I guess.    *Ray Charles was blind, right?  Or am I confusing him with Stevie Wonder, who was definitely blind and who I think is still alive?  If Ray Charles wasn’t actually blind, he sure seemed to wear sunglasses a lot.

       Hey, sorry for all the crappy writing and boring content on this site lately.  If you want to read something good, I highly recommend  urlLink my sister's site .  C Nemo entered the blogosphere only recently, and she is still in that honeymoon phase where you care about good writing, separate your thoughts into paragraphs, and actually check the spelling and grammar before you click "post."  Lately her blog has featured not one but two stories of sexual harassment in Cincinnati, which makes for fairly interesting reading.  Plus,  urlLink C is all over the Scott Peterson trial .  This is pretty funny to me, because for the last few weeks I have been meaning to write a post about how much I hate the Scott Peterson trial, because the news channels devote endless hours to talking about it when they could be entertaining me by having people yell about politics.  I was going to write that I do not know a single person who is remotely interested in the Scott Peterson trial, but apparently I do.

       It’s 12:42 a.m. on Friday morning, August 13, 2004.  For some reason I am having trouble sleeping tonight, so I thought I’d blog for a while.  Today I took the afternoon off and went down to Anaheim for a matinee between the Halos and Orioles.  I am a huge fan of Thursday afternoon baseball games.  One of the advantages of making it through the first 26 years of my life without ever having a real job is that I have gotten to go to a lot of Thursday afternoon baseball games over the years.  Today was a fairly typical Thursday day game.  I left my office at 12:40 for the 1:05 game.  My office is 31 miles from Angel Stadium.  I arrived at 1:50.  I pulled up to the booth where you pay for parking and realized there was no one in it.  So I just drove in and parked.  I walked up to the ticket window and asked for the cheapest ticket they have.  The lady said 12 dollars.  I said fine.  Then she asked me if I have triple-A.  I’m pretty sure I do, or at least I used to, so I said yes, but I don’t have my card with me.  No problem, she says, you can have a ticket for 6 dollars.  So far, so good.  I walked in and sat down in the left field bleachers.  (In case you haven’t figured this out, I was by myself.  Much like golfing, I often prefer not to involve other people when I go to baseball games.)  Inside the stadium there were about 30,000 people under the age of 10.  That’s what you get on Thursday afternoons, a lot of youth groups and baseball camps and day cares, etc.  I think there were about ten of us actually watching the game.  Anyway, my point about Thursday afternoon baseball games is that they are very customer-friendly.  It doesn’t matter what city you’re in (although I’m sure going to any game in New York is a baffling ordeal), you can just drive up, park wherever you want (usually for free), buy a cheap ticket, go in and sit wherever you want.  The rest of the story is that I watched the game and then I went home.  If you were expecting something to happen in this story, I am sorry to disappoint you.  I guarantee you this was a lot more exciting than what I do on most Thursday afternoons.  12:57 now.  I saw an article on cnn.com last week where Kerry was criticizing Bush for continuing to read to the schoolchildren on September 11 after Andy Card whispered in his ear.  Kerry said something like, “If I were President then, I would have politely excused myself and told the children that the President had to attend to an urgent matter.”  I understand that this moment receives some attention in the Michael Moore movie, which I haven’t seen yet despite Rebecca and Marisa telling me it’s the most important movie ever and I must see it right away.  Am I the only one who thinks this criticism is completely unfair?  For one thing, we don’t know exactly what Card said to Bush.  Presumably this was fairly early in the morning and only one plane had hit the WTC.  Nobody knew what the hell was going on.  Even if it was after the second plane hit (can anyone clear this up?), I doubt Andy Card was able to explain exactly what was going on in those few seconds.  Secondly, what the hell was Bush going to do in those seven minutes that would have prevented 9/11?  It’s not like he’s a superhero and he could have flown out the window and started rescuing people in New York.  There are plenty of things to criticize Bush for, but I don’t think his performance on 9/11 or the days and weeks immediately thereafter is one of them.  For a few months there, I thought he was a pretty good president.    1:09 now.  At this point, I just change the channel whenever Kerry starts talking about Iraq.  You could go crazy listening to him.  Two quick points about this.  First, Kerry cannot bring himself to say he voted for the war.  He always says something like, “I felt it was necessary to vote to give the President the authority to go to the U.N. and build an international coalition and to use force as a last resort.”  As A.W.B. Simpson would say, this is complete rubbish.  Everybody knew at the time that the Senate was voting on the Iraq war.  Some senators voted for it, some against it.  Kerry voted for.  I don’t remember anyone saying at the time that it was anything other than a vote for or against going to war with Iraq.  By the time of that vote, everyone in the world knew Bush wanted to invade Iraq.  Second, I really hate it when Democrats who voted for the war (like Kerry and Edwards) complain about Bush’s failure to build an international coalition.  Again, there are plenty of things I hate about Bush, but I don’t fault him on this one bit.  He tried to build an international coalition.  I think he and his people did just about everything they could.  In the end, the only significant countries they convinced to come along were Great Britain and Spain.  The reason nobody else came along had nothing to do with a failure of diplomacy and everything to do with the fact that this war was a terrible idea from the very start, as I have said all along.  If this election were simply about Iraq, I would vote for Bush.  You have two pro-war candidates running (plus Nader who is now completely insane and should be locked up right next to Al Gore).  One candidate I cannot even bear to listen to.  Bush at least has a coherent, arguably-somewhat-defensible position on the issue.  At least I understand where he’s coming from, and he’s honest.  (And if one more person says he lied about WMD, I’m going to go crazy like Ralph Nader.  A lie is when you know something is not true, but you say it is true.  Everyone thought there were WMD.)  But, fortunately, this election is not only about Iraq.  As I’ve written here before, we already went to war in Iraq, and there’s nothing we can do about that now.  Either candidate would probably do pretty much the same things there going forward.  I don’t buy this crap about Kerry bringing in a bunch of allies, and frankly I don’t know what good that would do at this point.  OK, I’m writing way too many nice things about President Bush, so clearly I should go to bed now.

       Yesterday after work I played golf with a couple summer associates out at Industry Hills, which doesn't sound like a nice golf course but actually is.  It is located in the majestic City of Industry, CA.  To explain this golfing experience, it is necessary to rewind to Monday morning, when I woke up at 5:30 a.m.  The reason I woke up at 5:30 a.m. on Monday was that I had a lot of work to do on Monday, but I knew I would be playing golf on Tuesday, so I wanted to finish my work in time to go to the driving range, which closes at 10.  Everything went smoothly, I billed 10-plus hours, and I got to the driving range before 9.  When I got there, I noticed there were no people hitting balls on the range.  This is a bad sign.  I live in southern California.  There are ALWAYS a million people everywhere you go.  If you drive on the freeway at 4 a.m., there are people.  If you go to the gym at 11 p.m., there are people.  Golf course, 2:00 on a weekday afternoon: people.  You get the idea.  A billion people live in Southern California and about 50 of them have jobs.  The rest exist solely to annoy me and get in my way.  So when I turned into the driving range and saw no people, I knew something was amiss.  And it was.  Nevertheless, I changed my shoes and walked to the ball machine.  Ball machine off.  I walked over to the practice tees.  There were about 100 balls by each tee.  There was a fairly attractive young woman sitting near the range doing nothing.  I asked her what was going on.  "The range is closed.  We're shooting a reality television show," she explained.  Something like "I'd Do Anything" or "There's Nothing I Wouldn't Do."    OK, fast forward to Industry Hills, 4:00 yesterday afternoon.  My tee shot on Hole #1 goes about 50 yards and hooks into the woods.  Lost ball.  I drop near the woods, bunch of trees around me, I just want to punch the ball out of the trees and back onto the fairway (well, not "back," since I was never there in the first place).  I hit a decent shot, but it hits a tree and goes right back into the woods.  Lost ball #2.  Next shot, another punch-out attempt, hits the lip of the cart path and nearly goes back into the woods.  I get an 11 on hole 1.  Tee shot on hole #2: wicked hook, lost ball #3.  Drop near the woods, 90 yards from the green with a pond in between.  I hit it in the pond.  That's four lost balls, and I'm not even done with the second hole.    Eventually, I settle down and start hitting magnificent tee shots and putting fairly well, although everything in between was shaky (can't even hit a 9-iron straight).  I end up with a 57-46-103.  The point of this story is that my miserable golf experience was all the fault of this stupid ESPN reality show.  Instead of "warming up" the night before at the range, I had to warm up on the front nine.  For this reason, I am urging my readers to  BOYCOTT THIS ESPN REALITY SHOW, WHATEVER IT'S CALLED .  Like O'Reilly urging his viewers to boycott the French for not supporting our pre-emptive wars, let's hit 'em where it hurts.  I would say let's boycott ESPN, but that would of course be ridiculous.    So that's my golf story.  If your name is George Bagnall, you may be wondering why you didn't merit a mention in this story, despite the fact that you endured four hours of golf with me yesterday.  I would simply refer you to the top of the page, where you will note that it does  not  say "George Bagnall's Blog."  *This post's title comes from the song "Girls Lie Too" by Terri Clark.

       I hate to get cheap laughs by making fun of an 80 year-old woman, but I just have to share with my readers some recent e mails I have received from my grandmother, one Florence Warnock.  Regarding this blog, she writes:  "I want to get into your blog but can't do it so what is the secret?  Can you send me some directions for how to access it because I NEED to know your thoughts on all of the current news!"  Apparently G'ma has had some trouble "opening up" this blog lately.  I replied and sent her the URL, but I'm not sure what else I can do short of driving down to La Jolla and typing in the address myself.    Now you may be thinking, "Wow, Nemo's grandma is 80 years old and she knows what a blog is!"  I agree, it is rather impressive, but in reality I'm not quite sure G'ma understands the concept of blogging.  She writes:  "I just read a blog from our local paper and find that 'blogging, the Internet journal/commentary/forum phenomenon, has grown enormously over the last year. Millions of blogs have been created....' and I've decided that the blogging community needs an elder's opinion on various things."    Now, when G'ma says she just read "a blog from our local paper," I think she means she read  the paper itself , perhaps the same paper that recently featured a front-page article about G'ma's gardening exploits.  And while I certainly agree that there is a dearth of octogenarians in the blogosphere, I am not sure an e mail to your three grandsons qualifies as a blog.    While G'ma may be slightly ahead of the curve when it comes to blogging, she seems to be a bit behind on the news of the day:  "I discovered that Trent Lott lost his job because of what someone put out about his statement about Strom Thurmond."  Well, I hope ol' Strom isn't too broken up about that!

       You may have noticed that this site now features a hit counter.  Actually, I would be shocked if ANYONE noticed, because it's WAAAAAAAAAY down at the bottom of the page, and I can't imagine anyone scrolls down that far.  Like everything else associated with operating a website, adding the hit counter to this site proved to be a baffling ordeal, despite the capable assistance of  urlLink Jeff Sukach .  I went to sitemeter.com and followed all of their instructions (which wasn't easy), and when I finally got it to say "Sitemeter has been added to your website," I went to my site and all it said was "Sitemeter" with a rainbow next to it.  The rainbow may have had something to do with this blog's continued support of same-sex marriage, but it more likely represented that I had somehow "chosen" a hit counter that does not allow visitors to the site to see the number.  Why anyone would want a hit counter like this is beyond me.  So I went back to sitemeter and looked at the help topics.  There are about 5,000 topics, none of which is: "my hit counter doesn't show the number of hits."  So I had to send an e mail to sitemeter, which was answered this afternoon by a fellow named Dave Smith.  I think he may have been my little league coach when I was 11 years old (or perhaps there is more than one Dave Smith).  Whoever he is, Mr. Smith explained how I can fix the counter.  I followed his instructions to the letter, and sure enough, there was the hit counter on my website.  The only problem was YOU COULDN'T SEE THE NUMBERS.  The number was black and it was positioned against the brown background of my blog and it was nearly impossible to make out the number.  No problem, I figured, I'll just change the background.  So I go into blogger.com, select a different background and figure I'm all set.  Not so fast, my friend.  I logged out of blogger, opened up my blog, and there was the old brown background.  Back into blogger, where I learn that you have to "republish" the blog every time you change the background.  So I did that.  Back out of blogger, back to my blog.  Brown gone, new lighter colors there.  I think you can guess what comes next: THE F***ING HIT COUNTER IS GONE!  When you republish the blog, the hit counter goes away.  So I had to start over with sitemeter.  A couple of non-billable hours later, I had everything just how I want it.  So I have a hit counter now.  As Bill Chrysan would say, "If anybody asks, we've got it."  Keep those hits comin'!
