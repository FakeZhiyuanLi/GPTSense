      When I stand up for myself and my beliefs,  they call me a bitch.   When I stand up for those I love,  they call me a bitch.   When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or  do  things my own way, they call me a bitch.   Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in  my heart. It means I live my life MY way. It  means I won't allow anyone to step on me.   When I refuse to tolerate injustice and  speak against it, I am defined as a bitch.   The same thing happens when I take time for  myself instead of being everyone's maid.     It means I have the courage and strength to  allow myself to be who I truly am and won't  become anyon e else's idea of what  they think I "should" be.   I am outspoken, opinionated and determined.  I want what I want and there is  nothing wrong with that!   So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner  flame,  try to squash every ounce of beauty I hold  within me. You won't succeed. And if  that makes me a bitch, so be it.   I embrace the title and am proud to bear it !!!!

      BGR stands for Boy-Girl Relationships.  -KAPAG NAGMAHAL KA NG ISANG TAO, ITO AY DAHIL SA NIRERESPETO MO SIYA. This, to me, is the most sensible part of the lecture. Here is when things get insulting and when i get defensive.  -HOW WILL MEN RESPECT YOU IF YOU DON'T RESPECT YOURSELF? True, true. But then, sometimes, guys are just really disrespectful regardless of how respectable we girls are.  -WOMEN ARE EASY TO GET AND EASY TO LET GO OF. I feel harsh winds from this one... if yknow what i mean!  -BEHIND THE SUCCESS OF EVERY MAN IS A WOMAN. AND BEHIND THE FAILURE OF EVERY MAN IS ALSO A WOMAN. It sounds great at first then ching! Nowhere near great! Ano?! Suntukan nalang?!!  -WOMEN ARE EMOTIONAL. THEREFORE, MEN ARE INTELLECTUAL. Stop me. Somebody please, stop me!  I know, I know. These are all very minimal but come on! Anyway, the lecture was Ok naman. Believe me, this isn't as contradictive as it seems.

       ACQUAINTANCE FELLOWSHIP  When: July 16; Friday  Where: CSI Gymnasium  Time: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm  With the "super long" time and "oh-so-far" venue, i naturally thought that our Acquaintance Party, scratch that, Acquaintance Fellowship would be really cheesy. But of course,&nbsp;I had&nbsp;to attend. &nbsp;  Armed with a cute outfit and a charming smile, a pretty hairdo and an armload of hip dance moves, i headed to the gym trying not to pay much attention to the rainy weather, determined to make the most of the night to come.  As usual, my musician batchmates began the event with Christian&nbsp;songs. After the guestspeakers, games, intermission&nbsp;numbers (our Jumpin' Jumpin' /&nbsp;Stomp to the Beat number was the supreme best) and dinner, the most awaited part of the night finally came.  There's&nbsp;not much to&nbsp;say about the dancing part naman since predictable na yun.  One thing that definitely fuelled my smile engine for the night is this, ahem, certain guy. To announce his name is to ruin his diskarte&nbsp;(and mine too)&nbsp;so I'll leave him anonymous nalang.   If you're reading this, you might be smiling. Don't worry, I'm smiling wtih you.  I entitled this 6 hours well spent kasi... self-explanatory, duh! I guess it doesn't really matter at all where you're going and what you're going to do coz as long as you're with fun people, everything's going to be fine.  In this case, everything turned out to be great.

      For as long as i can remember, math has been my most hated subject. I mean, c'mon, what is math going to do for me? All you get is a bunch of numbers, symbols, headaches and other shitty stuff like that. Like, what purpose will they serve in my life?! OK, here's an example. Question: If you find yourself with two boyfriends, what do you do? Choose the best formula to solve the problem.   GUIDELINES:  A= boyfriend 1 B= boyfriend 2 C= boyfriend 1 & boyfriend 2 0= you are so dead meat   CHOICES:  a. A+B=C=0 b. A/B=0 c. B/C=A d. 0/C=A=B   ANSWER:  A  Math makes life so much easier, right? It soo solves everything!!! It's so great!!! -duh. yeah, right.-

      The new high school building is functional, spacious and it has an ambiance for learning. the thing that's totally sucky about it is that it's so impyerno-like. and i do mean impyerno-like as in IMPYERNO-LIKE!!! Fortunately, yesterday, our principal announced that aircons would be installed na. Provided that students would pay an additional 50 pesos a month. That's only 500 for the whole year! Sounds great, right?  So, night comes and my mom arrives from our store. There i was all excited and happy to tell her the good news... and guess what? She starts ranting and yakking about how the school should have thought about it before na and dapat 'di na nila singilin yung parents. Of course, defensive little me, tried to reason out. But then, my oh-so-opinionated sister whom i expect to at least understand, rolls her eyes at me and gives me a nice, big, fat smirk. Then, my eyes start to well up with tears as i hear her shout "VAL, ANG SENSITIVE MO... SOBRA!!!" Great sister, huh? You can totally have her! And this is how the new high school building made me cry.  And oh, the comfort rooms don't even have mirrors! Comfort rooms aren't comfort rooms without mirrors! Mirrors are comforting!!!

      my review classes turned out to be a blast. (ok, except the chem and math part. and the 'ruining my social life' part too.) people were friendly and they were easy to get along with naman. found myself several new friends already and they're great. in fact, i can't wait until saturday! fortunately, i survived my economics chapter test. it was actually pretty easy. tomorrow's my physics chapter test. i'm not sure if i can survive that! feeling bubbly now.. got my friendster account back!!! although i kinda hate the 'salarin' (can't think of any word) for meddling with my accoount, at least he gave it back to me na. but i do hate him for erasing all my messages... especially marc abaya's message. arggh.

      no, i do not intend for my post titles to be three repeating words. it's just coincidental. i don't really have much time right now coz today's the first day of my second session of review classes. get what i mean? i had review classes na kasi nung summer and i'm having review clases again... the UPCAT is just a month away. (as if i'll even pass!) my curent review classes are only during weekends. sturdays at 1-5 and sundays at 8-5. in other words, my social life is ruined.  moreover, soccer varsity training is on fridays from 5:30-6:30 pm. like i've said, my social life is ruined. got 2 chapter tests for the coming week, a bunch of quizzes and assignments. and CAT's about to begin too. argh. hope my brain doesn't overload then suddenly explode.  and about that damned guy... i damn him some more!!!

      JUNE 30, 2004 Why are guys like immature little kids who depend on other people, specifically their bestfriend, to get by? And why is it that they like to talk and blab on and on about this and that but when they're faced with a situation wherein they're supposed to MOVE, they suddenly freeze up? Damn those guys who like to put girls through 'kilig' moments then abruptly take them away. Damn those guys who text you super mushy messages and even share you part of his load just so you can reply. Damn those guys who make you feel terribly guilty when they're down in the dumps even though there's absolutely nothing that you did wrong. Damn that guy for giving me these frustrated feelings and inspiring me to put them in words. Damn rainbowcoloredkalabasa (that's me). ARGGHH.

       The morning of their concert, heavy rains poured. Kainis, sobra! I was thinking PUUTTIIIKKK!!! It pretty much drizzle-rained, drizzle-rained the whole day. Well, the bad weather didn't stop me and my friends from going.   We  were at the venue, Baker Field to be exact, at around 9ish. The line was pretty long and lots of people were milling around. We got in at around 10ish and the front act bands were pretty good naman except for that one band that i found strange... different.   Southborder came on at past 11 na. I swear, my view (approximately 5-6 feet from the stage) almost caused me to faint. All throughout, i sang my heart out with them and screamed my lungs off whenever Duncan would come near. I think I lost around 5 pounds that night.    Anyway, MR.IDON'TWANNAMENTIONHISNAME made my blood boil. All he did the whole night was cough, sniff and yawn. He did a fantastic job of keeping his mouth shut! Argh. Whatever.   Basta, for only 130 pesos, the concert was super sulit!!!

         Damned Guy (check out my first entry) and I made up na nung Acquaintance Fellowship. He gave me a balloon... which he took from the table centerpiece. Hay. Sweet, noh? Too bad I lost it though... hehe.    Review classes are done na! Actually, this isn't something i'm very happy about. I'll miss it kasi... waaahh. And syempre I'll also miss all the firends I made... Phoebe, Red, Joel, Shinji, Rubber Ramon, Renz, Neil, CJ and everyone else. And yah, pretty pretty Ms. Dewmaine Sales.    One of our pet geese, we have two, died. The female one died and my sister said that the male one was crying daw, he was making all these weird whiny sounds. Awww...    The UPCAT is on the 7th and 8th na. My schedule is on the 8th at 630 am at the DAERS Function Hall. I am soo dead. Soo dead.
