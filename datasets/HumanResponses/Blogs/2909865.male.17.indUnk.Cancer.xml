      Well, again, I am bai gan jiao ji. I am glad that my Malaysian brother Set has gotten 11A1!!!Top in S'pore. Cheers for Malaysian scholar!!! U did us very proud...  I am so thrilled by the result of 04S7Aians that i have almost forgotten that I got 7 for L1R5...=( I think 04S7A muz be the best CT in S'pore...coz got 2 11A1s, 3 10A1s, 1 10A1+1A2, 3 9A1+1A2....and the most important thing is that the whole class can stay...04S7A RAWKZ  I was so pissed today...dunno which bloody romourer spread the rumour that i got 11A1 to the whole school...And I, poor I, b4 i got the result, was still happily being showered by accolades from frenz. Rumour and Scandal the roots of all evilzzz. I am very reluctant and hesitant to use this word, but i have no choice given my situation: Fuck the bastard Actually I feel very sad now...not only for myself, but for my brothers Kok Chong and Yuan Wei...I knew Kok is disappointed for not getting 11A1zz...i thot i can do it oso...feel quite Ke Xi for him...For YW, I think he juz had some bad lucks....but genuinely glad that he can stay... So back to me...I might be the only one in the Great Class 04S7A that would leave HC...If i have to leave, I definitely won't go NJ. I would choose RJ, VJ or SA. But HC still my fav.JC in S'pore. Hmm...maybe i needa appeal...but nothing to appeal on...no CCA talent...nothing...maybe can try telling them that i really love HC..haha...lame.Try not to be pessimistic.  But all the things seem bleak now... But as what Kok Chong and Mrs. Jaya said, it is the person that matters, not the environment. I was on the verge of tears when i knew i got A2 for Chinese...and my tears almost flooded my eyes when Mrs. Jaya said that. Mrs. Jaya, u're really a nice teacher...thought sometimes a bit slack and cynical...but very caring and understanding...and i am proud that my English, under her guidance for 3 years, has improved to A2...still regret that din get A1 for english...i gu fu liao Mrs.Jaya. Really wish that i could have done better and got all the A1, and make Mrs. Jaya proud. Nicest teacher in CHS. "YH, u did well, really! Juz that u're a bit unlucky for your chinese, but ur result is still very fantastic. No matter which jc u go to, it doesnt matter, juz give ur best. It is the person that matters, not the school nor the environment. And i know that u can do it!"    When i knew that i would not be on the stage, i can only think of 2 possibilities to explain why.: Maybe i got B3 for English...definitely they wun announce "LYH: 10A1zz 1 B3zz." Second possibility is that i got two or more subjects A2. And besides English, I cant think of any other subject that i will get A2 for...most probablt would be Higher Chinese, which depends a deal lots on luck. And, indeed, i had no luck the day i took Chinese. Both Lang A2....so pissed...L1R5=7, though msg 1.20, but still not qualify for graduation thingy...so ashamed of myself...so ashamed to see the Chinese teacher.  Went to Corwin place to K to fa xie. His house is really big, and beautiful. I really want to buy a house like this in the future. In his house having meals, playiing games, singing K, then i realised what is quality life.

      I can't find any words to describe my feelings now. I simply can't. My attempt to analyse my state of mind was in vain. I feel very empty, and very blank inside. But i can sense the embroilment of emotions in the deeper me. I am juz everwhelmed by my warring feelings. My mind was dulled by the things that are happening around me. My state of mind resembles the sunlight which is made of many colours disguised and blended as a white colour.  After a few weeks of intense study of the topic "adolescence" in GP, I find that I myself, no matter how mature i profess myself as, am still an emotionally insecure and fragile adolescent. I am reluctant to step into the fledgling adolescent that is already upon me. I thought I have passed the adolescence stage...the game has just begun...i was so astonished by my slow emotional development...I was too childish. Never in my wildest dream did i imagine that adolescence is a burden that would weigh heavily down my shoulders... I am trapped in the midst of adolescence, which I earnestly wish to but am unable to fight...  Everything happened so fast in the past two months. It was like a dream. And I, the dreamer, have finally waken up, in a realisation that i sincerely wish not to have realised. Yes, life is full of paradoxes. In the past two months, as I see more clearly about true friendship, I am more confused in the complexity and perplexity of friendship. My friend Zi Wei left for NZ a week ago, and i was there to send him off. There is a cliche that says that when a person is about to leave us, we would then start caring for him and paying attention to him. This is not true for me!!! I started becoming more aware of this friend only after a week since his departure. When i read his blog, i began to notice that he is not the person i thought he is. And the seed of pain and regret of losing a friend only started sprouting after a week of dormancy. I really start thinking that everyone is unique....and that everyone is complex in his thinking. I will pay more attention to understanding every friend of mine. And i mean it.  Love, to me, is the greatest thing on earth. Yet it's as deadly as AIDS to me. I don't feel much loves from the people that surround me. Love, of course, means more than romantic love. It includes love from friends also. And I can hardly feel the love of my relatives in a foreign country. And i have no lover....so love from friends is the only source of love for me. To me love is like a source of nutrients...Dunno why, i always feel that i am the love giver, but the love i receive in return is meagre...maybe i am too greedy...maybe i am mistaken...love and frenship is not maths, the eqn need not to be balanced... Dunno why i am constantly plagued by a lurking virus called depression, which culminates in the presence of loneliness. But i seem to have found a cure: brotherhood...but it is still in its primitive stage...it needs the element "time" to further enhance and prove its workability.  If i am confused with friendship and love, then i am totally at loss for me myself and I. After 16 years of living, growing and learning, i find that the most confusing thing to me is still my own self...my true self...the real me...the inner me. Everyone has his uniqueness and individuality....what's mine? I am really in the search for my self-identity...  The class had a gathering juz now at school...quite fun...dunno what to say abt it...speechless now...and need a time lag to formulate and organise my thots. A 7-hr sleep would do. I really think that "Auld Lang Syne" is a nice song. Juz like the song "Moon represents my heart", it is immortal.

      Some foods for thought:  I am still determined to be cheerful and happy, in whatever situation I may be; for I have also learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends upon our dispositions, and not upon our circumstances.  Death is more universal than life; everyone dies but not everyone lives.  A man should not leave this earth with unfinished business. He should live each day as if it was a pre-flight check. He should ask each morning, am I prepared to lift-off? (all is vanity?)  Unless man is committed to the belief that all mankind are his brothers, then he labors in vain and hypocritically in the vineyards of equality. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. (1908 - 1972), 'Black Power: A Form of Godly Power,' 1967  Before God we are all equally wise - and equally foolish. Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955)  All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others. George Orwell (1903 - 1950), "Animal Farm"  It is not true that equality is a law of nature. Nature has no equality. Its soverign law is subordination and dependence.  In the province of the mind, what one believes to be true either is true or becomes true.  Humor is by far the most significant activity of the human brain. Edward De Bono  That is the saving grace of humor, if you fail no one is laughing at you.  Women have more to offer this world than just a fallopian tube. Nothing is going to change until you quit looking at us as just sperm receptacles. Barbara Hall, Northern Exposure, Baby Blues, 1994  What are man and woman if not members of two very different and warring tribes? Yet decade after decade, century after century, they attempt in marriage to reconcile and forge a union. Why? I don't know. Biological imperative? Divine law? Or just a desire to connect to that mysterious other? In any case, it's always struck me as a hopeful thing.  You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty. Mahatma Gandhi (1869 - 1948)  To be brave is to love someone unconditionally, without expecting anything in return. To just give. That takes courage, because we don't want to fall on our faces or leave ourselves open to hurt.  I dont think anyone can DO anything that would make him worthy of love. Love is a gift and cannot be earned. It can only be given.  I think I should have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of music. It seems to infuse strength into my limbs and ideas into my brain. Life seems to go on without effort, when I am filled with music  If a thing isn't worth saying, you sing it. Pierre Beaumarchais (1732 - 1799)  Music is the wine that fills the cup of silence.  Music has charms to soothe a savage breast  To soften rocks, or bend a knotted oak.

      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life.  "A fight is going on inside me," he said to the boy.  "It is a terrible fight between two wolves.  "One is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, greed, regret, lies, self-pity, arrogance, guilt, resentment, inferiority, false pride,  superiority and ego.  "The other is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity,  truth, compassion and faith.   "This same fight is going on inside you - and inside every other person, too."  The grandson thought for a minute and then asked his grandfather, "Which wolf will win?"   The old Cherokee replied, "The one you feed."

      Great prides come with great falls  And one fall, just one, proves to be fatal  When we fall on the ground, it hurts us,  but we also need to rely on the ground to get back up.  You need resistance in the air to fly in the air.  But i am glad i fell early, as it allows me to have more time to climb up, and climp up strong, as a man  All other factors, alll other variables, are juz excuses, are juz a landing platform for my slothful self...i am at fault, and i have to help myself,no one else would.

      My birthday...  Thrilled and upbeat!! coz MS sent me (via my mum hp) a sms wishing me happy bdae...yayyy!!!  here is my astrology reports...i don't believe in these...but freaking accurate it is   Sun Aspects Mercury  Just as in the natal chart, the solar return Sun is never more than 28 degrees from Mercury so does not form any major aspects other than the conjunction. Mercury conjunct the Sun indicates that the intellectual mind is actively involved in the goals of the Sun. Reading, writing, learning, and communication in all forms will be important to the pursuit. Find out more with your full-length report...    Section 2: Mercury In The Solar Return Chart  Mercury Aspects Uranus  Uranus-Mercury aspects suggest that you are open to new ideas which may take the form of new information you are learning or new concepts you are developing yourself. These aspects can show great creativity since they imply that the individual is able to approach problems from many different angles and is not locked into one structured way of thinking. Use this time to be innovative and original. Brainstorm with others. But, because your mind is somewhat unstructured, your ability to think clearly may be interrupted by erratic impulses and an inability to concentrate over any length of time. New information may be more exciting than reorganizing what you already know. If you must work on a major project that requires sustained mental energy, take frequent breaks

      It has been an eon since i last blogged. I am no longer the stormy Diego that i had been for the first few months. I have "metamorphosed"!! And i have been searching for the words that can define my life, words that mean a lot to me. Passion, Faith, Happiness, Love...four so far, but i am already very satisfied. I have seen and learnt many things this year. It has been the most enlightening year for me.It would be an understatement to say that i have enjoyed living the year 2004, or should i say the JC life. jc life has been one that is full of events and things. Concerts, bdae parties, outings, ponning...all very exciting  A quarter of JC life has already gone. And i look forward a more excitng and you yi yi one-and-a-half year. And i know wat i want to achieve in JC already..not glory, not fame (i have had enaff...ahem...haha)...it is frenship, and sweet memory =) And i would live every moment to its fullest!!yay

      I agree with Yuanwei's nick now...sometimes in life, when the whole world makes u feel down, u juz wanna point ur middle finger and say FUCK YOU...pissed....pissed...pissed...and fucked up...   Beyond is good...damn good&nbsp;   And i think it is perfectly alright to say "fuck you", it simply shows ur true class and style. Aside from tt, it also shows tt you are not unpretentious person, frank and direct....becoz i think everyone in the world at some points will feel fucked up....and if we dun say it out, it will accumulate inside us, lowering our serotonin level, which is a chemical substance in our body that makes us feel good and alive. Only hypocrite dun sae fuck...or maybe they juz have no guts to say so  disagree?

      why  why  why  what is life?  I hate, i am disgusted  &nbsp;  Why is everyone else boasting about their goods and flattening other's ego  Why is it that there are so many whys?  &nbsp;  N a stark realisation dawned upon me juz now: I am a man with no talents  God, if there is one, has never been fair to me...it gives me things and takes them away brudely  Now i know why do some teenages commit suicides. Becoz there is no direction in their life. And there is none for me either.  &nbsp;  I have been wrong. I am mistaken. Life is not beautiful, life is extremely nasty and disappointing. Everyone else is blessed with some real good talents, but why is it that He is so particularly ungenerous to me? haha, jealous of me?  &nbsp;  My studies juz sux. SUX. sux. And going to school&nbsp;would juz dampen&nbsp;my passion for pursuing knowledge. And my love for Biology knowledge is squarely extingushed when i found tt i couldnt get in the Bio O training. Then Block tests are killers, and killed me.  I really have no talents in science i think.  &nbsp;  My trombone. I felt quite good playing brass quintet with them, but still find that my trb sill is very lan. I think it has in fact deteriorated with each year's passing. And my music is really bad, absolutely no talent in it. And my trb tone, something that i have been proud of for long, i find, is juz lousy and nothing compared to joseph, zhuan quan and others. I should have gone to RJ. Better trombonists, better trombone, better musical environment.  &nbsp;  Well, what other talents do i have? Chinese chess is bu kan yi ji. Bball very lan and no stamina, talk cock too lame and kena despised. Eyesight bad. Bad health. My music sux, singing sux, dancing sux. IQ low, EQ and AQ non-existance. Not respected by friends. No dignity and worth. I am juz a piece of scrap paper. Dispensable, and totally useless.  &nbsp;  Beyond is really good. Best band. Without their music i will not live. And luckily my comp is back. and back to the old state....cool, austere, no content, unpacked and unburdened...haha

      Been reading The Da Vinci Code...a damn cool book...   a few points raised  1) Female is left, male is right...and does it imply Catholic sexual discrimination?  2) the golden ratio...the Divine proportion...PHI...1.618...simply too amazing and unbelievable...&amp; also the Fibonacci Series - 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...  3) Mother Earth...is the nature of this world feminine? as suggested by Leonardo da Vince, who worships goddess and feminity...  4)The Priory of Sion - a secret society which includes members like Sir Issac Newton, Bottivelli, Victor Hugo, Leonardo da Vinci  5) Leonardo da Vinci - Mona Lisa - Amon and L'isa are god and goddess of fertility  - Vitruvian man, showing the pentacle  6) Every faith in the world is based on fabrication. That is the definition of faith - acceptance of tt which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove. Religious allegory has become a part of the fabric of reality. And living in that reality helps millions of people cope and be better people 7) It is the mystery and wonderment that serve our souls, not the Grail itself. The beauty of the Grail lies in her etherreal nature. Holy Grail is simply a grand idea...a glorious and unattainable treasure that somehow, even in today's world of chaos, inspires us 8) History is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books - books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe. Naponeon once said, "What is history, but a fable agreed upon?" history is always a one-sided account.  - the Last Supper  - Madonna of the Rocks, which is unorthodox  6) Pagan faith is a faith that worships feminity and mother earth and goddesses

      i knew it...i knew it only too well...i knew that you would come back...  and WELCOME BACK Mr. Lew Yin How, you have gone through your enlightenment phase...the first half of the year has been the most critical in yuor life...it is the most useful period, as you are enlightened finally.

And it is not the end, it is juz the beginning. Now, it is time for you to be mindful...and to be a truly great man, one that you want yourself to be.  Everything is set in place, and it is time to fly and soar....let passion and your mindfulness guide you to the path to true happiness...

      My Type is  INFP   Introverted Intuitive Feeling Perceiving  Strength of the preferences %   56            22        56      22   http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp   Analysis http://keirsey.com/personality/nfip.html  Healer Idealists are abstract in thought and speech, cooperative in striving for their ends, and informative and introverted in their interpersonal relations. Healer present a seemingly tranquil, and noticiably pleasant face to the world, and though to all appearances they might seem reserved, and even shy, on the inside they are anything but reserved, having a capacity for caring not always found in other types. They care deeply-indeed, passionately-about a few special persons or a favorite cause, and their fervent aim is to bring peace and integrity to their loved ones and the world.   Healers have a profound sense of idealism derived from a strong personal morality, and they conceive of the world as an ethical, honorable place. Indeed, to understand Healers, we must understand their idealism as almost boundless and selfless, inspiring them to make extraordinary sacrifices for someone or something they believe in. The Healer is the Prince or Princess of fairytale, the King's Champion or Defender of the Faith, like Sir Galahad or Joan of Arc. Healers are found in only 1 percent of the general population, although, at times, their idealism leaves them feeling even more isolated from the rest of humanity.    Healers seek unity in their lives, unity of body and mind, emotions and intellect, perhaps because they are likely to have a sense of inner division threaded through their lives, which comes from their often unhappy childhood. Healers live a fantasy-filled childhood, which, unfortunately, is discouraged or even punished by many parents. In a practical-minded family, required by their parents to be sociable and industrious in concrete ways, and also given down-to-earth siblings who conform to these parental expectations, Healers come to see themselves as ugly ducklings. Other types usually shrug off parental expectations that do not fit them, but not the Healers. Wishing to please their parents and siblings, but not knowing quite how to do it, they try to hide their differences, believing they are bad to be so fanciful, so unlike their more solid brothers and sisters. They wonder, some of them for the rest of their lives, whether they are OK. They are quite OK, just different from the rest of their family-swans reared in a family of ducks. Even so, to realize and really believe this is not easy for them. Deeply committed to the positive and the good, yet taught to believe there is evil in them, Healers can come to develop a certain fascination with the problem of good and evil, sacred and profane. Healers are drawn toward purity, but can become engrossed with the profane, continuously on the lookout for the wickedness that lurks within them. Then, when Healers believe thay have yielded to an impure temptation, they may be given to acts of self-sacrifice in atonement. Others seldom detect this inner turmoil, however, for the struggle between good and evil is within the Healer, who does not feel compelled to make the issue public.   http://typelogic.com/infp.html  INFPs live primarily in a rich inner world of introverted Feeling. Being inward-turning, the natural attraction is away from world and toward essence and ideal. This introversion of dominant Feeling, receiving its data from extraverted intuition, must be the source of the quixotic nature of these usually gentle beings. Feeling is caught in the approach- avoidance bind between concern both for people and for All Creatures Great and Small, and a psycho-magnetic repulsion from the same. The "object," be it homo sapiens or a mere representation of an organism, is valued only to the degree that the object contains some measure of the inner Essence or greater Good. Doing a good deed, for example, may provide intrinsic satisfaction which is only secondary to the greater good of striking a blow against Man's Inhumanity to Mankind.   Extraverted intuition faces outward, greeting the world on behalf of Feeling. What the observer usually sees is creativity with implied good will. Intuition spawns this type's philosophical bent and strengthens pattern perception. It combines as auxiliary with introverted Feeling and gives rise to unusual skill in both character development and fluency with language--a sound basis for the development of literary facility. If INTPs aspire to word mechanics, INFPs would be verbal artists.   Sensing is introverted and often invisible. This stealth function in the third position gives INFPs a natural inclination toward absent- mindedness and other-worldliness, however, Feeling's strong people awareness provides a balancing, mitigating effect. This introverted Sensing is somewhat categorical, a subdued version of SJ sensing. In the third position, however, it is easily overridden by the stronger functions.   The INFP may turn to inferior extraverted Thinking for help in focusing on externals and for closure. INFPs can even masquerade in their ESTJ business suit, but not without expending considerable energy. The inferior, problematic nature of Extraverted Thinking is its lack of context and proportion. Single impersonal facts may loom large or attain higher priority than more salient principles which are all but overlooked.   Famous INFPs:  Homer Virgil Mary, mother of Jesus St. John, the beloved disciple St. Luke; physician, disciple, author William Shakespeare, bard of Avon Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (Evangeline) A. A. Milne (Winnie the Pooh) Laura Ingalls Wilder (Little House on the Prairie) Helen Keller, deaf and blind author  Carl Rogers, reflective psychologist, counselor Fred Rogers (Mister Rogers' Neighborhood) Dick Clark (American Bandstand) Donna Reed, actor (It's a Wonderful Life) Jacqueline Kennedy Onasis Neil Diamond, vocalist Tom Brokaw, news anchor James Herriot (All Creatures Great and Small) Annie Dillard (Pilgrim at Tinker Creek) James Taylor, vocalist Julia Roberts, actor (Conspiracy Theory, Pretty Woman) Scott Bakula (Quantum Leap) Terri Gross (PBS's "Fresh Air") Amy Tan (author of The Joy-Luck Club, The Kitchen God's Wife) John F.

         The Wish of Wishlessness     Ask me what I want, and it is "Not to want. "I don't want three little wishes; what I need are fewer wishes.  Having this, I want another. Getting that, I want some other. How unfulfilling this endless wanting! How disgusting this trap of yearning!  Why drink sea water to quench thirst, when salted water only feeds your thirst? With pure water wash away, all the saltiness in the way.  But "What about pleasures?" you may ask. Those from wanting never really last .Feel nice scratching a beckoning itch? Nicer still is not having an itch!B  ut for no desire at all, can one desire at all? Is there any way out of this at all? There's desire that feeds its own fire, and that which leads to desire's expire.  So what do you truly want, my friend? Just how sure are you that it will ever end? Out you go then, craving's fire! For Nirvana's cool, let's all aspire.  -shian
