      Holy Cow! It's been a pretty long time since i've wrote in here. Um wow, lets catch up on things. This past weekend...hmmm... saturday janelle was at a cheerleader carwash until 2&nbsp;i think, then she had to go to a bday party for her great-grandma. I was on my way to circuit city around 7:00 and janelle called, so i went and picked her up and we went to circuit city so i could get a new phone and then we went to dairy queen and saw kelly/serah/bethany. I took her home around 9. Sunday was f'in awesome! Her fam picked me up around 9 am, and we went to Knoebles Grove ALL DAY! It was so fun and awesome. They have alot of awesome rides and if it had more roller coasters it could majorly compete with hershey. I got home around 12 or 1 in the morning so i decided not to go to football on monday. Me and janelle didnt see each other monday, but we hung out tuesday. I went to her house from like 1-5:30 (she had cheerleading practice so i had to leave early), Wed. I didnt go to football again because i was up at nathans eating wings until around 12:45 and then we got a firecall around 1, after the call i was at the firehouse with my dad and another guy talking until like 2:30 so i was to tired to go to football, so i woke up and around 10 i got&nbsp;janelle and she came with me to circuit city/ verizon wireless/ gander mountain/ super petz. I got a new xbox at circuit city, i got a new phone at verizon, at super petz i got some supplies so all my pets can eat when im away on my vacation, and gander mountain I got nothing. We got to my house around 12, and we hung out in my room until like 5:45. We watched donnie darko and some of freddy vs. jason, and some tv and other random things that i forget, that day was definitly very very good. Thursday is today and i didnt see janelle today but i had fun. Ummm i cant even remember what i did today. Oh yea, i got up talked to janelle for a while, ate lunch, cut the grass, talked to janelle, went on a firecall, talked to janelle, went to wendys, went to the firehouse meeting, came home and played some madden and talked to janelle. Tomorrow morning im definitly going to football because i miss it and its gonna be fun (angle ball). After football is over rutter is taking my to janelles house and i get to chill there all day, its gonna be awesome. Swim/chill and other crazy stuff. Saturday Im leaving for the beach!!!! Im taking brett to wildwood, NJ. Its gonna be awesome, were getting out own room and im video taping and everything, were right next to the beach and a block away from the boardwalk. Im going there until wed. or thurs. Im not really sure, but it will be awesome. Well im gonna go and make some cds for janelle and for my trip. I may update tomorrow night. PEACE!!!

      Today was a&nbsp; semi good day. I didnt do anything at all today but play some madden, get on here some, go to the firehouse for about 30 minutes, and watch a movie, i was fine with all that, I didn't get to bored and I talked to janelle for a bit also. Anyways, the movie i watched today was "Hatred of a Minute" another one of the movies in my horror movie collection. You can check out my movie collection here:  urlLink http://guzzlefish.com/collection.php?username=yourdemise47&amp;PHPSESSID=492c74b0d61990c5f83ff0af82276866 &nbsp;  Check out the value!   Me and janelle started watching hatred of a minute the other night and she didn't care for it much, so i turned it off so we could do other stuff. Well i watched it tonight and I must say, it was a great movie. The ending was awesome. Thats all I will say about that. Ummm...I don't really know what else to say.&nbsp; I guess I will part with you, i will go to bed now, I have to get up at 6:30 for football, I think im hanging out with janelle tomorrow night, it will be fun. Update tomorrow night, PEACE.

      sorry i did not update last night, I don't know why i did not. Anyways. yesterday was a good day. Janelle came over for a bit but not all night because she had cheerleading practice. So she was here from like 11:30-4. While she was here, we took my paintball gun and went down to the park and shot at trees and random things, she was really into shooting it. Uhhh..then we walked to wendys and ate lunch there. It was fun/awesome/cool/great/wonderful. Then we walked back to my house and we went upstairs and just layed on my bed for about an hour then we went downstairs and watched cky3. After cky3 was over, it was about time for her to leave so i was just watching for her mom while she was gathering up her stuff. She left and that was pretty much it for the night. Today I did nothing with janelle. I woke up at 7 and went to the firehouse at 8. Me, stevie stilo and two other members went to the summerdale diner for obviously breakfast. After this we came back and had to go down to the park for fire fighter safety day for the kids at day camp down there. We were there for about an hour. Nothing exciting but it wasnt boring. We came back to the station and did random work then I came home. I was so tired, i made a veggie burger and some nuggets then i sat down to watch some tv, i was freezing for some reason so i got one of my multiple fleece blankets and wrapped up in it and went to sleep. This was the dumbest thing ive ever done, as you will find out why in the next sentence. Janelle calls me and i had been sleeping for like an hour. I woke up hot as a mother f'er. I was sweating and shit because it was obvioulsy not cold in my house anymore, i will never wrap up in a fleece blanket in the middle of the summer again. I was so hot, and i answered the phone and i was half asleep and i had no idea what the hell i was doing. I just told janelle i'd call her back. I got up and collected myself and came back down to mars (outkast reference if u didnt know), then i called her back we talked for a bit then got off the phone. Ummm...i didnt really do anything else the rest of the day/night. I just sat around here all night and then janelle called back around 9:40 and we talked for about a half hour. Thats pretty much it. I don't know what im gonna do tomorrow, probably nothing. This weekend will be awesome though. Saturday i may be taking my moms car down to sunco to get washed by janelle and the rest of the cheerleaders, after her car wash is done were chillin for a bit then going to see the terminal at 7, ive wanted to see it since it came out, and i found out hampden amc is still playing it, so were gonna go see it. And sunday im going to Knobles Grove with janelle and her family for a hella good time. It should be awesome. Well i'll update tomorrow night. PEACE!

      today was good. In the morning i just sat around because i had nothing else to do. At 4 i went to the high school and got my physical and took my imPACT tests for football. It was a waste of time and took forever. Anyways, when i got done, janelle and my mother were waiting for me. I drove us to mcdonalds and we got some dinner. Came home and ate obviously then me and janelle went upstairs. We watched some tv for like 10 minutes then started to watch a movie, we watched about a half hour of it but it was going really slow and boring janelle so i stopped it. Then we watched a home movie of xmas as janelles in 2001. Funny stuff. Then we went back upstairs and layed around for like an hour and a half. After this we went outside and acted dumb for like a half hour and then her mom picked her up. Now its 10:30 and im tired so im gonna go play some madden then go to bed. Tomorrow i get to hang out with janelle some more, AWESOME! So yea, it was a good day, nothing incredible happening but spending time with janelle is all I need. Update tomorrow night. PEACE!

      Hmmm...yesterday was awesome. You know what i did in the morning as i already posted it, but after that was great. Janelle picked me up around 11 and we went to her house so her family could change clothes (they were at church). Then we picked up her mammy and we went to the huge Cabelas store. The drive is about an hour long. We got there and this place was packed. The parking lot is almost as big as hershey parks parking lot. We were there for awhile, theres so much to see and do there. We didn't buy alot of stuff, her youngest sister got a shirt, her dad got some fishing stuff, and i got a slingshot and 3000 bb's. We ate in cabelas (they have there own restaurant in their store), its called Cabelas Campfire. We all ate there and we left cabelas around 5. We got home and janelle, her sister melanie, and I went downstairs and watched the secret window. We came back up after the movie and watched some old famliy movies of X-mas 94 and 95. Around 9 her mom took me home. On the way home we had to stop at the elementary school and check things with her mammy. (She is Mrs. Greene the janitor at the elementry!) We walked around inside the school for a half hour, the place looks so small, the halls downstairs are so small, there not wide like high school. I got home around 9:30 i guess and went to bed around 10:30. I went to football this morning and now Im here. Im gonna be chillin' with janelle here all day, so yea, update tonight!

      im home already, is 10:09 am. Im going to janelles in like 2 hours but anyways. Last night was awesome. I haven't seen brett since school was out and it was very cool to chill with him in hershey. The whole atmosphere is just so much better down there. Everything is not so clustered and crap. Brett picked me up at like 6 last night and we went to the capital city mall because we had to pick some stuff up. I had some gift certificates for suncoast and one of them expires on july 20th, so i figured i would get some movies for us to watch. I bought the amityville horror and the 13th child:the legend of the jersey devil. He went to old navy and got a pair of flip flops (he bought the same exact pair i have.) then went to hot topic and he bought a shirt that i saw, i noticed it and i said i want to get it for school, AND HE BUYS IT! GOD!!! So now we will once again have the same shirts, last year we had the same the used shirt and now it will be the same thursday shirt. The shirt was awesome, it was brown with a red dove in the top corner, and then it made it look like the dive was flying straight down, like an animation, there were like 5 doves on it, the top one then all the ones under it that made it look like it was going down. Then we went to fye and he bought a cd. After this we left the area and went to hershey. We had to stop at walmart and get a calling card for him and vanessa to call each other, then we went to giant. Brett got hired there a month ago but they haven't scheduled him yet, we had to get milk and soda so he figured he would see if they scheduled him yet. Well it just so happens that his first day of work was this morning at 9:30 am. Unbeleivable. Then we went to his house. His room is the best place ive ever seen in my life. The whole basement is his room, hs's got a bathroom and everything in his room. Its so big and awesome. Well we got to his house and ordered some pizza since we always do that when i sleep over, and after we got done eating the pizza it was like 8:45, so we put the amityville horror in and watched the first&nbsp;hour of it (its 2 hours) and then vanessa called. We talked to her on the phone for like an hour and a half. When we all got off the phone it was like 11:20. Me and brett were gonna go for ice cream but we decided to just go to sheets (his mom and tom were at the beach for the night so we could go out anytime). We drove up to sheets and he got a jones soda and i got a mountain dew code red slushie. We left sheets and on the way back brett wanted to show me this resevoir to skate in. We stopped in the parking lot (Which is a block away from his house, and this parking lot is right next to hershey park, so bretts house is a block away from hershey park, its so good), we checked out the resevoir and then left. We got home at like 12:45 and finished watching the amityville horror. Were saving the 13th child to watch on the way&nbsp;down to the beach, im gonna borrow janelles portable dvd player.&nbsp;I think we went to bed around 2, im not sure. Anyways, we wake up this morning at 7 so brett can get ready for work, blah blah blah, we leave around 8 so brett can get me home and he gets back in time for work. Alright, were driving along, and we come to this red light, the light was yellow and brett decided we were gonna make the turn ( we had to turn left) it was raining out and all that, and u can figure out what im getting at. BAM!!! We ran right smack into one of those damn hershey kiss light poles. HAHA! We werent hurt or anything, it just hit the tire because he turn real sharp and the pole hit the front right tire. It completly bent the axle and the tire was stuck up against the frame. So yea, we couldn't go anywhere, we walked back to his house and he called his moms cell phone then we called the cops and all that. Luckily his mom and tom were only 20 minutes away from getting home, they got home, we filed all the reports and stuff, we took brett to work, they took me home. And now im here! Awesome, well im gonna go get a shower and all that so i can go to janelles house all day, it should be awesome, i love her house and her family is awesome. I guess i'll update later tonight when I get home. PEACE!

The game was awesome and the fireworks for unbeleivable. uhhh...thats pretty much it, during the day i just sat around. Today i had a class at hacc for firefighting, and now im obviously about to leave. Tomorrow im going to janelles at like 2-3 to swim and chill all evening like usual, should be very fun and awesome.

      well, now janelle is staying at kelsi's house tonight. I really hope those two are having fun with themselves. You know, even when me and scott were inseperable and chilled non-stop, i don't think we had 3 night sleep overs, except when we went to the beach. I wouldnt be surprised if they had another sleep over tomorrow night even thought im going to a senators game with janelle and we wont be home till like 10-11. We'll probably pick kelsi up on the way home. Im at the point that I don't care about it now. Im going to bretts this weekend so they can do whatever they want. This has been the gayest week i've ever had in my life. I can't wait till janelle wants to hang out next week. Yea, so this is all I have to say about today, update tomorrow night. Peace  &nbsp;

      today was about the gayest day ive ever had in my life. First off, i didn't do anything with janelle yesterday, i was planning on doing something with her today and it turns out kelsi ness, her cousin, slept over, so she was at janelles house all day so me and janelle couldnt do anything. Well guess what, kelsi is sleeping over there again tonight. Have fun with that. I also found out that janelle can't go to the beach with me, whatever, bretts going now so its all good. I'd rather have janelle hang out with me and have her talk to jeremy anytime she wants then to have her never end it with kelsi because this is getting good. Kelsi hates it when janelle calls me and she is there so when janelle calls on nights that kelsi is sleeping over, she talks for like one second. Awesome. So yea, i sat here yesterday, i sat here today, and im gonna sit here again tomorrow. Im sleeping over at bretts house on saturday though, so i finally get out of this dumb town and get to hang out with someone. Then im probably spending all next weekend at his house also, should be awesome. Well thats all i have to say right now, obviously there will be another update tomorrow night. later

      today was as fun at the previous days. Today was actually pretty dumb and a waste of time. I woke up at 7:30 to go to some "huge flea market" in lancaster. My dad told me its bigger then silver springs flea market and its alot of stuff to buy and some food vendors. Well we get there after an hour long drive on the interstate and it turns out its like 99.98% food vendors and like .02% cool stuff to buy. I ended up leaving with 7 movies that i bought, they were all horror movies since that is what I collect and I got them all at one vendor. So i took an hour long drive to buy something for one person. After we leave this fleamarket we took like a 534698736478 hours drive through the country. My parents are all about doing that gay crap like driving around for no reason and looking for deer. I'll tell ya what, ive never wasted more time in my life or been more bored. We left the flea market around 10, and i got home around 3, thats how long of a drive we took. Unbeleivable. I came home and talked to janelle for like 3 seconds then i had to go to a firefighting class. That was from 6-10. That was a waste of time to. I got home at 10:22 and janelle called at like 10:35. I was planning on doing something with her tomorrow since its the last day i can see her until friday (its only one day in between that we can't see each other, but its along time to wait) and it turns out her unknown cousin kelsi ness slept over. Have alot fun with that one. So im gonna go to football tomorrow and then sit around all day. Should be good. Update on my life tomorrow night. PEACE

      Today was also a fun/awesome/good/wonderful day. I woke up this morning at like 1 when it started to rain and i was so happy because i knew we wouldnt go out to the field today for football. Well i obviously went back to sleep and woke up around 6:30, showered, and went to football practice at 7. I was correct in my not going outside assumption, we lifted for about an hour then did some sprint drills and position drills in the gym and played angle ball for about 45 minutes. Well I came home and sat around for a bit then I walked up to the firehouse and got my gear together ( i didnt have it put together because i wanted to wash it but never did, but I had a feeling that we would have a firecall because of all the rain, and sure enough, i went home and about an hour later, we had a call. Smoke in a building over on erford road. Me and stevie stilo just talked the whole way to the call because we knew we werent gonna have to do anything, we knew it was just something little. But the ride there was awesome. The driver was swerving in and out of cars and crazy stuff. Anyways, we got back to the firehouse after the firecall and i stayed for about another hour because we had to do some maintenence. I went home at about 12:20 and got a shower and called janelle. We decided that she would come over tonight for dinner and we would watch a movie, etc. Well I had to wait until almost 4 to go pick her up, because my mom was working and my dads truck was at the garage. But we eventually got her, after a needed stop at the giant for some hamburger for tonights dinner. We came back here and went upstairs and started the movie while my father started to make the tacos that we wouold have for dinner. The movie me and janelle watched is called S.I.C.K (it stands for Serial Insane Clown Killer), It was pretty freaky and weird and janelle was scared in some parts, im not that scared because all i watch is scary movies and im starting to know what happens in every single movie i watch, but the suspense and everything is awesome. Some movies still are very scary to me. Anyways, we got interupted halfway through the movie because my mom got home and it was time to eat dinner, we obviously went downstairs and ate and then we went back up to my room and finished the movie. After the movie was over (around 8) we "watched" the Home Run Derby until we took her home at 9:30. Thats it, she went home I came back here and now Im at the comp. Tomorrow morning im going to a big flea market in lancaster, it should be awesome, I want to get a big mirror for my wall and im gonna try and find an atari, im sure i'll find a bunch of other awesome things, i love flea markets. Update will obviously be tomorrow night. Peace

      this is obviously my first day writing in here, since this is entry numero uno. Ummm...anyways, today was a nice/good/fun day. I woke up and janelle called and told me to come over. So i got ready and all that crap and went to her house. Her mom made some really good homemade chicken corn soup. Her mom is the best cook ever and she always makes big meals on the weekends. After lunch we swam for a couple hours. Swimming is fun except when janelle gets out and tans and im left alone :-( Her sisters are usually there with us though so i can swim with them then. After we were done swimming we went and got some fishing rods and lures together and we got our bikes and road to conodoguinet creek. Her house is semi-close to Armitage golf course and theres a bike path near there that leads to the creek, so we went that way. We only fished for about a half hour because she doesn't really have the patience to fish, but she really likes to do it, for the couple of minutes that we do each time we go. I was getting real close to the edge of the water and i didnt reall notice that it was all muddy and i had my old shoes on from 8th grade that have no grip left and i slipped and fell in the creek. I Didn't really fall the whole way in, just my legs went in, but it was pretty deep for being right on the edge. my shoes were filled with mud and my hands were all muddy, so janelle just told me to go out in the middle of the creek and fish, i agreed but for some reason i didnt go out right away, i got out of the water and walked around for some reason and i was getting ready to get back in slowly so i could go out in the middle, and then i fell in again. Well this time i got big chunks of mud in the bracelets that janelle made for me so i got out of the water again so i could lean my hands in the water (instead of easily placing them in the water while i was standing in it), and when i leaned in the wash my hands off, you guessed it, i fell in again. Somehow all three times i fell in, i only got my legs wet and not my shirt. Luckily i was wearing my swim shorts, so it didnt really matter. After the third time, i just grabbed my rod and told janelle i'll be back. I fished in the middle of the creek for like 5 minutes because janelle wanted to leave right when i got out there. So we pakced up and rode back to her house. We got back and swam some more then her grandma took me and janelle and her two sisters to brewsters for ice cream. It was good, but i couldnt eat all mine so i threw the end of it out. We came home and me and janelle and her sister melanie (her oldest sister, shes 12) watched a movie downstairs, its called "MadMan" its one of three horror movies i bought at suncoast two weeks ago. I buy a scary movie like every weekend at suncoast because i love them, but i bought three on a "triple points" weekend there. I belong to the replay points club and each penny u spend there, u get one point, for every 10,000 points u get a $5 gift certificate, and on the triple points weekend, my total points from my purchase gets tripled so i got a shitload of points. I spent 45 bucks. I have 25 dollars in certificates so far. After we got done watching the movie it was like quarter till ten so her mom took me home. Now im here typing this and stuff. Thats it for today, come back tomorrow night for my daily update.       urlLink     urlLink  Click Here         [  urlLink View Guestbook  ] [  urlLink Sign Guestbook  ]  urlLink  Get a FREE guestbook here!

      Hmmmm....recaping my life since that last time i updated...   Friday I went to football in the morning, football is always fun so I have nothing else to say about it other then it was fun... Friday during the day I went out shopping with my grandparents again. We went to kohls and I got three shirts and then we went to boscovs and got another shirt.I forgot what I did then but later that night janelle and her mom picked me up and we went to kohls. Her mom had to find a dress for a wedding they were going to on saturday, and we were babysitting janelles 6 month old cousin, so when janelles mom was trying dresses on, me and janelle were walking around kohls with the baby and everyone was giving us dirty looks because they thought the baby was ours! Haha. After kohls we stopped at taco bell and went back to her house. Both her sisters were sleeping elsewhere for the night so it was just janelle me her mom and the baby, her dad was out fishing I think, i forget. It was a very good night, we werent bothered by her sisters and all that and It was just very fun. We went out on her trampoline for like an hour or possibly more and just layed there and looked at the clouds and talked and then we went and sat on her front porch and then we went for a walk. The walk was definitly fun, we talked about what all were gonna do when winter/christmas comes around, god i love winter and christmas.  We also talked about friday nights this fall, were both really excited for football season to start, its gonna be so much fun. Ummm...after all this we just chilled at her house for a bit and i went home around 9:30 or so. Saturday janelle had to go to a wedding for a bit so i had to go out with my gp's once again while janelle was at this wedding. We only went to walmart so it wasnt that bad. We also went to old country buffet to eat, pretty good food there. Janelle and her mom picked me up after there wedding and then we went to her house for like an hour. Then her mom took us to the mall. We shopped for like 2 hours and then saw napoleon dynamite, very very funny movie. We got so much cheap stuff at the mall though, well i only got a belt for 4.97 but janelle bought that for me, its from american eagle and its navy blue/forest green. Janelle got like 4-5 shirts and the most expensive one was $3.99 Every store is having the best sales ive ever seen, its so good. I obviously came home after we were done seeing the movie. Today I went to janelles at 12 and we didnt do much for like 3 hours but sit around and crap and then we ate our big dinner that janelles mom always makes on sunday. Today it was ham/sweet potatos/mashed potatos/corn. After this we went out shopping, we went to walmart and janelle got a bunch of stuff. I got a big mirror for my room beacuse ive been trying to find one, and it was only 6 bucks! So good. After shopping we came back to her house and me and her and her two sisters went swimming for like 2 hours or something. It was very fun. Then we came in and chilled for a while and watched some of scary movie 2 and then me and janelle went on another walk. After the walk we came back and got on the trampoline. My mom then showed up because it was time to go home. I came home and now im here at 12:15. I guess I should go to bed since i gotta get up at 6:30 for football. Thats it for now. PEACE!

      Yo yo Yo,   Im back from the beach and here at home right now obviously. I went to wildwood in New Jersey. I didn't do anything out of the ordinary just the normal beach stuff, went out in the ocean boogeyboarding and went to the boardwalk and crap. I bought/won janelle a bunch of stuff and thats about it. I got home yesterday around 1:30 and went right to janelles after i took a shower. I was so excited to see her! I got to her door and she opened up and jumped on me and started kissing me. :-) She's so wonderful. I stayed at her house until she had to go to cheerleading practice (she's varisty captain!!!). I didnt do anything else that night except run a couple firecalls because of the big storm. Today i went out shopping and stuff with my grandparents and janelle. I got two movies/computer game/ accesory for my aquarium/new toys for my hamster, janelle also bought me two new fish and a candle. We got home from shopping and me and janelle chilled in my room for like an hour then she had to leave for cheerleading. I just sat around here after that, i lifted weights for about a half hour because it was definitly needed, ive missed 3 of the last 5 workouts for football because of the beach and being out to late the previous nights so i didnt want to get up so early, but im going tomorrow and it should be fun. Friday is angle ball day which is always great. But one thing that sucks is that wed. was equipment day and i wasnt home for that so all the good stuff will probably be gone, etter said they might have a few revolution helmets left, god i hope so. Ummm....tomorrow im going out shopping again with my gp's and janelle (my gp's are staying here with me because my fam went to michigan to visit relatives, so my gp's are buying me stuff). Were going to kohls to look at all the crap thats on sale so maybe i can find some clothes for school, i dont know. I dont know where else were going but in the evening me and janelle are going to the capital city mall to shop and buy her clothes and to see napaleon dynamite. Saturday janelle has a wedding but she said were gonna chill during the night and then sunday i'll probably just go to her house for swim/chill all day/night. Should be an incredible weekend with my incredible girl! Thats it for now. PEACE!
