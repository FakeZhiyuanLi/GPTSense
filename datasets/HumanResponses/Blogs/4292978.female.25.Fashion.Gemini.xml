      so i ended up doing some work today.  but now it's 4pm so i'm officially winding down.  why do i complain about this job?  it's actually really easy.  it's just so easy that it's draining.  ya know?  so maria and i were talking about nipples.  it really fucking pisses me off that men can freely show their nipples and girls can't.  it makes no fucking sense at all.  for one thing, men's nipples DO NOTHING! they are not used for any purpose.  girls nipples on the other hand just happen to feed small  humans on certain occasions...not to mention the fact that they are beautiful to look at. BUT STILL...even when these nipples are in use, THEY STILL HAVE TO BE HIDDEN!! if dudes had to breast feed, they would do it with their shirts off in public....women should be able to do this TOO!  it's retarded and inconvinent and embarrassing and pathetic.  is it because women's nipples are sexualized and men's nipples are not?  does it just all come down to our societies sexual fucking repression?  i'm thinking so.  but why does the fact that nipples are sexualized overpower the fact that they are actually food vessles for small humans....isn't that more important...shouldn't nipples be givin equal rights as legs or hands or faces especially since they basically give life?  what the hell is up with this?  i mean...i don't want to go around with my nipples haning out or anything....but this mystery has been bothering me for a long time!!!

      they fucking rule.  i'm so pissed the show was sold out on fri night.  there was a bunch of dissappointed goths outside of du nord...but they weren't hot topic goths they were like 1920's goths.  glam goth or drama goth or some shit.  anyway, they looked good.  and so did we BUT the show was sold out so we went to hemlock.  i fucking hate that place.  a bunch of dumb ass hipsters.  we were standing at the bar chatting WAY too long.  i kept getting pushed and bumped all over the place.  also, guys kept doing that thing where they are trying to walk by you but they feel the need to put their hands on your arms or back in that totally creepy inappropriate and un necessary way.  chonie really hates that!  i was about to scream and i demanded that we leave.  i'm sorry...i know i'm like in my twenties and i'm supposed to like hanging out at bars or whatever but i'd much rather stay home.  bars are desperate, annoying, and gross!  oh yeah so the dresden dolls....  i want to be like this band!  they are like pj harvey mixed with tori amos but more punk than both.  goddamnit! i want to rock ass!  blog is my imaginary friend.

      wow.  i've been here for two hours and i've done no work yet.  weeeee!  so i've decided that i'm going to attend SF's own Miss Marty's school of beauty!  Screw Paul Mitchell...they are all pretentious and over priced.  I'm trying to decide when to start the program.  I want to start SOON.  but i have some debt...wondering if i should try to pay it off before i start school.  i'm thinking NAWWWW.  i don't want to put this off any longer!  the idea of quitting my job is AMAZING!  i won't be an office slave any more!  ever again!  dear sweet meredith has offered to be my head to practice on when i'm in school.  i might even take her to fairfield for the state board test!  i told her it would be fun for her but that was actually a lie. (shhhhhh don't tell)  no more driving, i can sell my fucking money pit car, no more Palo Alto, no more sitting on my ass in front of a computer.  i would be happy if i never had to use a computer or touch a piece of paper again for the rest of my god forsaken life!  i want to touch wet heads only!  Miss Marty's here i come!  my boss just asked me to detect a mysterious smell in his office.  i was really expecting something dramatic....you know like rotting flesh or something...but NO...it was the smell of damp chalk.  now he wants his chalk tray cleaned.  christ!  i will call janitorial services....or i might just do it myself so i don't have to talk to anyone.

      neat!  like whoa...i got comments.  this is fun.  so it's fucking monday.  i feel like i'm on drugs.  whoa...my boss just introduced me to his fiance....man i didn't know he was gettin' some.  goddman it...now i'm really pissed i only got a 3% raise.  jesus!   it's cute...he said 'now the two most important women in my life have met'  like whoa!  ok whatever  so this raise has really inspired me to be punctual.  i was only 15 min late today.  this weekend was pretty fun.  we played at the peace plaza in japantown.  it was one of those shows where i couldn't wait for our set to be over.  i couldn't hear my vocals and i couldn't hear merediths guitar.  we both agreed that it was terrifying.  it's really really hard to sing when you can't fucking hear yourself.  i'm already getting sick of playing live and that was only our 4th show as slow thrills.   oh and i take back what i said about minmae...they were actually really good.  sort of pixies sounding.  i don't know why i didn't like them when i saw them at du nord.  i must have been in a bitchy way that night.  so i was told that i shouldn't be using a guitar pedal for my vocal effects....something about the range isn't big enough..i don't know.  basically i need a different kind of effects thingie.  i also need a new piano.  which is hard because the whole money thing.  i'm spoiled now.  i need a keyboard that feels like a real piano or it's no fun. this means mucho $$$  anyway,  i just got to work and i'm not warmed up yet so  BYEEEEE!

      so last night we were laughing at the power walker olympic competition.  what's with that?  i don't get the diff between power walking and jogging...except power walking looks all crazy in the hips...those hips be swingin side to side all elvis style. i think elvis acutally invented power walking...or maybe it was operah.  i think it was operah!  but really...it's a sport which is sweaping the GLOBE!!  we're playing with this band called 'minmae' on sunday in japantown.  for some reason i derive great pleasure by talking shit about other bands...that's probably not good though. but seriously there are a lot of totally generic OBX bands out there.  all i can say is that the drummer makes this face when he's playing which looks like he's gazing down upon the woman he is date raping....it's really creepy.  everyone should really come out and check it out.  this band is a bunch of blown out fur faces and i don't personally get their music but that's not saying much since i normally dislike male singers.  i like boy singers that have either soft high voices or really dark sexy voices.  i don't really like anything in between.  and it really bugs me when anyone...guy or girl...only has like a one octive range.  this one day i lost my voice from trying to be a punk rocker. i thought it would never come back and it made me very sad since singing is therapy fo scho.  today i  have managed to do no work.  i am tired.  i'm always tired.  i read that chronic exhaustion is a sign of job burn out. ha!  i fucking hate my job.  i enjoy complaining about it.  the second i get out of the car after driving home from work for a fucking hour, i begin feeling like my bouncy self again.  today i had lunch with my friend at work and she was sobbing almost the entire time saying how she wants to kill herself because life is pointless but she doesn't have enough courage to actually go through with it....man, i was having a hard time figuring out what to say...she basically snapped at everything i said so i just hugged her and rubbed her back.  then we went for a walk around campus and she started feeling better.  i know how she feels...i don't really get that way about work though.... i've been in a pretty good mood lately but slightly irritable at the same time.  i was just trying to comfort her without maker her feel mocked by my good  mood.  we talked about the politics of taking sick days.  on our employee evaluation forms there is a section for the supervisor to comment on attendence.  i really don't understand why they give a supervisor space to comment on an employee's attencence when the university gives employees TONS of sick days.  to me...it is my goddamn legal right as a full time fucking employee to take the sick leave....THE BENEFITS i have accrued as an employee of this institution.  to me...that leaves no room for any critisism of my attendence.  if we had NO sick leave left or if we just forgot to show up and didn't call or anything....i could see that being a problem.  but to use the sick leave that you have accured is perfectly normal, necessary, and RIGHT!  my friend here at work gets the 'bad attendence' speech everytime her review comes up so you know what happens?  she feels like shit but comes to work anyway just so she can sit here and cry or get other people sick.  it's fucked up!  and for the record...being depressed counts as being sick...just because you can't shove a thermomitor up depression's ass and get an exacto reading doesn't mean it's not SICK!  i know that the administrative sciences is not the best career path for me.  and also, commuting makes me ill on many levels. so i'm currently trying to figure out how to fund my continuing education in the cosmetology field since that's what i've wanted to do since i was 7 years old.  i have no doubt in my mind that i would LOVE being a cosmetologsit.  the problem is that cosmetology is hellsa expensive, yo!  and you can't get 'financial aid' when you already have a fucking bachelors.  yeah so i have two choices DEBT or CONSTANT IRRITABILITY AND EXHAUSTION.  then there's being an international pop star....but i'll worry about that one later.  i think the world needs an international pop star with black hair and a booty...that's what the world has been waiting for  especially japan.
