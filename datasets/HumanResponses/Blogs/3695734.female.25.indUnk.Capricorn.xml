      Last night I went out, drank wine, ate lobster, indulged. Felt like I needed it, but then as I was enjoying the moment, I realized I felt like I needed it ALL THE TIME. Oh what a spoiled little brat I can be, and oh how I adore it. Part of the sensation comes from my most recent issues. I love my friends for not meantioning that I let myself go over the last few months. They are always saying that I am gorgeous, and make me feel like I am beautiful no matter what. I know they love me, and they are so supportive, I love them so damn much!!! Historically, unless I feel like I have a stable hold on reality, unless I am actually happy, and not doing the whole superficially happy thing, I fall apart. My looks suffer, my life suffers, I feel ugly and useless and my looks reflect that.  So I am going to therapy, not ashamed of it, since I go to therapy when I know it will help. I am back to dieting, and I am trying to start schooling again, and getting life in order again. Still, I hate whats going on so much thatI've begun to randomly vomit and get panic attacks. I am scared, and feel like hell. I can't keep food down, I can't stop crying, and when I go out I am trying so hard not to show the [ain I am in that its killing me.  Its time for a new chapter, and cleaned up, healthier, happier, me, and I am working on it. I just hope I can get more started before the whole world crashes down on me.  Well, gonna run.. ttfn.. better news soon

      Okay, so I was looking through a variety of spa "menus", each offering up various rejuenation packages, shiatsu, zen, each catering to a woman who needs to have a reason to be pampered. I hate that woman, I need to be pampered constantly and with due spoilage! I need a woman doing my nails on each hand, two handsome men at my feet doing my pedicure, a glass of champange in hand as I get my facial, and in the end I want to feel like a kitty who got her cream. If I want to be all zen, I will finda hill and meditate, not spend good hard cash to pretend like I am all holistic. Sure, there are times when you want to buy a new yoga mat, or you run out of green tea chai.. but plu..leez. I am not going to the spa to get anything more than spoiled and pretty. The experience of being spoiled and pretty is all the zen I need in that moment, and if I need a mood alteration.. thats what chanpange is for. I am not going to the spa for spirtual enlightenment, I am going there because I know I am a goddess and I deserve to be treated and whorshiped as one. I am going to the spa to be adored and to experience adulation, not to find inner peace.

      First I should state that not all men are monsters, just the ones who are so foolish in there interpretation of amazing that they cannot see there own faults and only see those of the women they wish to possess. Whilst off in europe I put on about 25 pounds.. yes.. a large sum, and one which was at the time well worth it. I indulged to my hearts content and make no excuses for it. I drank, I laughed, I enjoyed myself wholeheartedly. I come and am reminded that I am not as slim as I had been, and that I would be prettier if I was. Yes, I know I need to lose a few pounds, I feel like hell and I want to be healthy, but it takes time and energy and I have had little of either. Honestly Ihave been painfully depressed, I miss europe, the people over there just seemed to know something that is missing over here, something having to do with happiness. Well, back here it seems so superficial and I know have a yearning for more. I can't be happy with the old ways, I don't feel that anymore, and thus I am depressed sitting around with a few nights crying into Ben and Jeeys. I am not perfect, but if someone just gives me a little time and lets life take its course, I will return to being myself again. I hate fat-phobics, who never seem to understand that I have been up and down more times than the stock market. I will be fine, but in the mean time I know I am not so slim and I really don't want to hear about it.

      I have read Seductress and the Book of the Courtesans, and many more and in they all state that in order to capivate others you must have a special gift, something that makes you spectactular versus just another pretty face. I agree. So tomorrow I start massage school. Sounds simple right? For one thing, I am renown for my touch, which I work pretty damn hard to keep in excelent condition, secondly I need to do some typoe of occupation that removes me from the dulldrums of office politics. The sad part is, I don't know one person anymore willing to pay for my services, they all want them for free. I am not some harlot, but if I learned one thing from the courtesans of the past, its that my abilities should not be given without recieving something benefitial in return. Many people offer themselves as vollenteers, hoping to get my abilities under the guise of "helping me". They make no donations towards my supplies or my time spent, none offer to pay for the gas it costs to come to them, or even offer me a glass of wine to sooth me after what can be preet exhausting work. They see it as a freebie. Some people deserve it, Sarah, Jesse, Steve, not only do they tell people about my abilities, they have been with me since the begining. I really can hear their advice on what I can do to be better, and believe it. Others are simply not worth the effort. So here is to me becoming even more well rounded in my skills (and more intimidating to the undeserving) toodles
