      Well I started the day off with a fun dose of Renae humor.  (You survived the parking lot I can see if you are reading this)  Also, Mr. Powers asked how I was and I said good and he's like I like it when your in a good mood and are smiling.  Compliments are awesome!  Everyone should give them and get them.  Off to Algebra, but not without first stopping to talk with Lizzie and getting asked for gum by Kurt.  Maybe I should just give the kid a pack of gum?  But anywho...Mrs. Wettlaufaur had her baby so we now have a sub til Christmas vacation (fyi: I don't know if that's how you spell her name, isn't that bad?)  Oh, and Mrs. Newitt had to go and mix things up on me and give us a new seating arrangement.  GRRR!  I don't like change how many times do I have to go through this?  But I did get 100% on my quiz so kudos to that!  Lit and Comp was so dumb.  Sorry to break it to you Mrs. Benz but Pres. Bush didn't write that speech, his speech writer did, so maybe you should tell him how good it is.  Lunch was interesting.  I'll explain farther on.  Chemistry was good, I did very well on my test as predicted.  I was so thrilled that time ran out in AP History b/c I didn't want to present my court case without my partner.  Newspaper was interesting.  I feel I must say that RHS has become a sex crazed school.  I'll explain.  A person who I won't name cuz I don't know if that is right but "The Pill" fell out of her purse for the entire study hall to see.  Then on my way back from the bathroom I was reading the board above the drinking fountains and someone put a boobie mobile cartoon up.  Granted it was funny, but wrong and after enough ppl read it Mr. Powers decided to see what all the commotion was about and took it down.  Then, when Renae and I were roaming the halls working on the photo survey, this freshmen came up to us and asked if that was a condom on the floor and we said no that was a piece of paper and she's like no there and Whoa... It was.  People, control yourselves!    Lizzie and I are going to the play tonight!  FUN TIMES!  I can't wait, I've heard so many good things about it!  tata

      So we just skip Tuesday and move right on to Wednesday.  My morning was nice I suppose, although, come on new seating arrangement in Algebra PLEASE!!!  Those kids are not only dumb but they smell really bad!  It's not being mean if it's the truth!  The rest of the morning was the same old stuff.  Then came that hoop dancer at lunch.  Seniors be glad you didn't have to go to that!  I found it boring, but others said it was cool and I say to them, "did you have your eyes open or closed?"  Chemistry was okay. We stared dem. Analysis when I was gone yesterday but I breezed through the worksheet she gave us b/c I've already done that in Physics.  See they go together, stop calling me nutz for taking them at the same time.  History was horrible!  We got our tests back and let's just say I've never done that bad on a test before.  Newspaper was triumphant b/c I got to delete AJ's name off of the layout slot.  If you didn't know how do it or didn't plan on ever learning why didn't you tell Mr. Powers sooner?  This is the end of my AJ bashing I will stop from now on I promise!  Then after school it was off to make up a chemistry test.  I know I did well on that.    ~Sean, stop looking for the girl and she will find you.  Also, some days I agree with your friend Chase on his high school relationship philosophy.     ~Megan, Thank you for reading my blog...it's so worth typing now.    ~I have a hard time decided what to put in here b/c I don't know who reads it, if anyone.  I'd like to say though I've given up on a certain someone.  If you're nosey and wish to know I'm sure I'll tell you.  But just let it be known.

      Wow haven't updated since Friday.  I'll spare you the details of my weekend at Watertown because I don't want to put you to sleep too quickly.  Shall we recap my day.  We shall.  Algebra was math like, physics was boring as normal, and the vocab test in AP Lit and Comp could have been more studied but oh well I can't go back in time.  I had to eat lunch by myself b/c Eaner was missing in action today. *tear*  Mr. Powers made me run the paper.  I hate doing that by myself b/c sometimes you have to battle with the copier but I was happy b/c no such thing happened today.  Towards the end of study I talked to Jason about Chemistry.  It was so cute he was so concerned that I understood it b/c this morning I didn't.  Renae he's a keeper.  Much better than that Tysdal kid you have your heart set on!  Then I breathed a sigh of relief when Mrs. Nelson said our test in Chemistry was tomorrow b/c all along I thought it was today and I was worried b/c I didn't understand it.  Hooray for that.  Then in AP History, I had to take my test from last friday, which was extremely hard and i know I failed it b/c I saw a bunch of check marks.  Maybe I could have studied more for that one too.  But Syndiu (sp?) and I had to go to the library b/c we started a new project so we went to do research but as fate would have it we had to use the computer lab and who would I be ever so near to?  Yes, that's right Lizzie, the Boy that can melt icebergs.  WOW!!  Moving on, in Newspaper I typed.  I won't get into what happened or my feelings about certain ppl b/c then I'll sound really bitchy and I'm trying real hard to stay away from that.  But I do have one comment to make.  In chemistry John Stanley said, " Geez, there sure are alot of bitchy girls on the newspaper."  After reading Liz's column.  I could have turned around and slapped that boy! grr  On a lighter note: sweet dreams all!

      ah, well my day was again there.  I came home at the very end of 5th period b/c I didn't feel very well.  My tummy hurt and I blame Subway.  Tami, my sister-in-law, said that my brother, Brian, got sick off of Subway last week.  I think it is a conspiracy.  Everybody eats Subways, gets sick, looses weight as a result, and then thinks back to the last things they ate and come up with Subway and think "but whoa, that's healthy food I must have lost weight from eating right."  The Subway Diet my ass!  We live in such a vein society that one would think just eating Subway for every meal would make you lose weight.  Sorry folks, diet and exercise!  That sounded very pissy.  eh, read on!  At lunch today, I was talking about Subway and Mr. Powers just happened to be close by and heard me say "Damn Subway".  Well, needless to say he freaked out.  If you know Mr. Powers you know his thing against swearing.  But Nicki can say every word in the book and get a "Nicki don't say that" but, I say "Damn" and he acts like I committed murder or something.  He said it was because I never swear.  I wasn't about to tell him my dad told me I swore like a sailor.  But I don't agree with swearing, it is very unattractive and a sin I realize this and I try not to I do, I do.  But sometimes when you get mad it just comes out.    Right, so I came home sick and everything.  I was really tired but I knew I couldn't fall asleep b/c I had to pick my brother up from school and I knew I wouldn't wake up on my own if I fell asleep so I forced myself to stay awake.  But when I got home I did some homework and then fell asleep at around 5 and was waken up by my mom (again) at 9.  She's so worried I'm sick.  Well, I am, that's why I came home.  But she's like why are you so tired all the time?  And I gave her a really dumb answer and she's like "Kayla you're so snippy!" I'm not snippy, it's just if you ask a stupid question, you're gonna get a stupid answer!    When she woke me up it was to tell me that I had to start packing for our trip to Watertown this weekend. Fun times I know, I can't control my excitement. yay!  (completely sarcastic)  I was told to pack a nice outfit for the dinner at the Drake.  It's my grandpa's 80th birthday so everyone is in town for it.  But let me explain the Drake for those who have not had the privilege of eating there.  It's a truck stop hotel.  It's run down, has nice food, but it is far from being the Four Seasons!  Why do I need to dress up to eat at the truck stop hotel?  Also, since I fell asleep I got minimal homework done so this means I'll have to work on it up there with everyone asking what I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and why I didn't get it done sooner.  It's none of your damn business!    Mr. Powers would not approve of all the swearing in my blog.   Maybe I am sick...or just grumpy.  I don't know why tho I've had plenty of sleep!  But I think I am off for more sleep!  Goodnight!  Oh, and Renae, before I forget, the hot hy-vee guy doesn't like me.  Just because I've exchanged words with the kid doesn't mean anything.

      Today was...well it was there.  I had a hard time paying attention in school today.  I found myself spaced out a lot.  oh well.  Maybe I need more sleep?  The morning was fun, wink, wink!  Going to lunch wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, although I still prefer eating in Mr. Powers's room 4a so I get to eat earlier.    Tidbits: ~Contrasted to yesterday, Mrs. Krull thought I was a senior today.  Thanks, you made my day!  But she also thought Kate and I were sisters, so.... ~Renae, I think Jason likes you.   ~Hanson is awesome! hehehe Don't give me that look Renae!  They so need to come to Sioux Falls! ~DBQs suck ass! ~Inventor of Oreos was a genius! ~I have that spacing out feeling again so I'm gonna.....go to bed

      I'll be honest with you, I am extremely tired and a bit grumpy.  This state has nothing to do with what happened to me today because really nothing did.     Although I ask you do I look like a Junior?  My aunt came today from Virginia and was talking to my mom and said "Kayla must be about a sophomore now, right?"  (rolling my eyes) And then Jason.  He has an excuse though because he didn't know me last year.  At lunch he saw my ID tag and said "whoa, you're a junior I thought you were a sophomore."  Yes, peoples I was a sophomore last year!   I know I may be about a year younger than everyone else in my grade but that doesn't mean I'm a grade level younger!    When I came home from school I laid down in bed and started to watch TRL but fell asleep (maybe it was because Britney Spears was on it?)  But I only got an hour nap in b/c my mom woke me up!  GRRR She got all worried and kept asking if I was sick.  NO! I'M JUST TIRED LET ME SLEEP!  I hate it when ppl wake me.  Isn't it unhealthy, too?  ~tata

      Oye, another good day in the life of me!  I've discovered a pattern, in the mornings when I see hot hy-vee guy and we exchange words my day seems to go better.  Huh, you figure it out.   Although, today he was going through my bag when I came back into the room.  I don't know what that was about he said I didn't have games on my calculator but I already knew that he could have asked and I would have told him the same thing.  But whatever he's cute I'll forgive him.  I'm thinking either Geoff or AJ told him I liked him b/c I get the feeling he knows.  I doubt Jason told him b/c Jason's not like that.  Or I guess he could have wandered into my blog and put two and two together and found out too.  oh well.    My morning was ya know school.  Lunch was fine.  Jason is a pretty cool kid.  Thanks for helping me with my physics question! Chem. was whatever.  I got a really good grade on my test but I expected that b/c it was super easy!  AP History was fun b/c we were supposed to work on our DBQs but did we?  No!  Brian Newcomb, Lizzie and I talked all period...one of my favorite past times.  haha Newspaper was there.  And obviously as you can all tell I survived my band room trip afterschool!    I went to Sioux Valley for the explorers program tonight b/c I liked it last year.  Hopefully this year we can do more things in the Pharmacy department b/c that's what I want to go into.  Pharmacy is a realistic career.  Right, Dad?  Although, if money weren't a factor I would try mass communications or something to do with the media b/c I really like that.   But we have to be practical and Pharmacy seems like a really nice career to go into and I'll have my cousin Jon to help me out since that's what he's in school for now.   Plus I found out tonight that's what Emily wants to go into too so that will be nice if that's how everything turns out.    I think that's enough nonsense for now night

      I had a very very good day today!  But I had a good morning so that set the mood for the rest of the day.  Shall we start off with my morning?  Sure!  So I woke up at 6 thinking that getting up early is overrated and that if only school started two hours later it would be so much better.  Don't you agree?  But I had to go in early to make up a Physics lab.  (yea fun I know)  But Jessica came with me and helped out.  I don't think I thanked you Jessica for that.  So Thank You!  Then we traveled down to the J-Lab where I worked on a worksheet of AP Lit and Comp that I forgot at school, which Jess also helped with.  But then who should walk in?  Reliving moment:  (feels him looking at me)  "I'm sorry" then he says sarcastically "Yeah, you should be" and then laughs.  That just made my morning.  (Remembering reading an article in a magazine at the dentist office where this guy read some girls online journal and it talked about him in it and how much she liked him and it turned him off to her.  I so didn't just typed what was above ;-) )   In Algebra 2, she put us in these groups and I don't mean to sound rude or anything but the other kids in my group aren't exactly the brightest crayons in the box.  Then in physics we went to the computer lab.  Next up AP Lit and Comp, where we acted which is always fun.  Oh, lunch after that.  Where Mr. Powers and I talked about Jessica's and my band story.  Look for it in the next Nationalist ppls!  FYI: AJ if you're pissed about me taking over your half of the story maybe you should have done work on it so others wouldn't have to!    After lunch comes Chemistry like always where we got to speak in front of the class. Oh, I have to tell you about the Stampede boy in my class.  Do you ever get this feeling from someone that they want to talk to you but they don't know how or what to say?  Maybe?  Well, I get this feeling from this kid.  Lately he's been turning around and talking to me which I welcome b/c I could use some more friends in that class.  Next, comes AP History which was scary!  I HATE DBQs with a passion!  Finally, Newspaper, it was well it was.  I still have issues with AJ.  I have to do my work for the Daily plus her half b/c she never does it and if she won't who will?  On top of that I have to do my Nationalist work!  And all the other stuff Mr. Powers sends me out to do!  GRRR AJ!  Her work ethic is nonexistent.    After school  I walked out to my car with Kurt.  Lucky dude got to stay home from the beginning of the school today and sleep in b/c he was tired.  I'm tired now...  Goodnight all!

      Ducky went down the hoooooole!  I pushed the button, I pushed the button, I pushed the button again.  haha....Tiny Toons was a great cartoon, why did it go off the air?    I got to sleep in till 9 this morning which was wonderful considering I haven't slept in that late for about two weeks.  I layed in bed and watched TV for about 2 hours until I got the motivation to go get dressed and start my day.  I didn't do much in the unpacking area.  But I had confirmation at 2.  I really enjoy confirmation and don't dread going to it like I did CCD last year.  It's nice to have the OG kids with us too.  Yes, their is a particular boy.  Gosh ya'll know me so well.  Renae, do you remember that band that played at the Battle of the Bands at Terrece Park?  Well, he is the drummer (yes the drummer, you know my weakness for the drums) of Bobjilolly or however you spell it or say it for that matter.  But I don't know if it's the O'Gorman education but he's really knowledgeable about our faith.  I like that.  My mother would call him a "nice catholic boy."  And he's cute, super nice and athletic, and plays the drums (2 points for that)  Nothing will ever happen with him but whatever I still like him.  Renae u would so approve! haha  Care to hear about my Joel issue....you have no choice.  See I met Joel when I was a freshmen and he was a senior at church in our Youth Council and he was always really nice to me but then he graduated and went to the Army but now he's back and going to school at Southeast I found out and every Sunday when I see him at church during mass or at confirmation he won't look at me nevertheless say hi.  But then when he does it's really sarcastic.  I don't know what his problem is but I'd like to find out.  FYI Erica you'd think Joel is really cute I know you would.    What else?  I can't really think of anything at the moment.    tata

      I have my computer up and running again!  The world is right again!  I'm now in my new house!  I haven't updated in about a week so:   Tuesday:   We packed the U-Hauls with all of our crap to move.  Wednesday:   I came home sick.  Which was more hassle then it was worth I think.  But we had to stay at Baymount cuz we couldn't get in our new house.  Oh well.  Thursday :  Unloaded all of our stuff in our new house  Friday:  Unpacked my room...some what.  Saturday:   I woke up and went to school to take the PSAT.  Ya...I don't think I did too well on that, but oh well what can I do now?  Then afterwards, Lizzie and I went to the mall for lunch and then she wanted to look for a formal dress which just was sorta depressing for me because you can't buy a dress if you don't have a date.  HINT! HINT!  After the mall I brought Lizzie back to school so she could pick up her car and then I came home and did some more unpacking.    Okay, so my life wasn't very interesting this week.  But, seriously, how could you top the show at the beginning of the week?  You can't!  FYI:  Relient K...If you like Christian music they're okay, but if you don't they're not such a good band.  So ya'll no, they're just not!    Randomness:  Lizzie, I saw that glare you gave me AP History when Mrs. leistra started talking about political parties and she's right I don't agree with everything but a majority of it I do.    night!

      KAYLA HAD A VERY, VERY GOOD EVENING!  Renae and I finally got to see Witness!  They were fuckin' awesome, wow! Sorry guys, but the second band almost put me to sleep.  I liked the girl's singing but the screaming didn't make much sense.  Then Appleseed Cast was good.  I wouldn't listen to them all the time but they were good.  That was worth my 8 bucks.  Kurt and Ross were there and I got to meet some ppl from Renae's work so it was fun times.    Afterwards, Renae and I went to Hy-vee cuz I was thirsty and it was on way home ;-)  But the hot hy-vee guy checked me out...oh fun times, fun times.    Tonight was defiantly a 10 on the fun scale!  ~tata

      Today was another 8 a.m. morning.  Duke woke me up at 6 wanting to go to the bathroom so I guess you could say it was a 6 a.m. morning.  I had Buger King for breakfast, which was gross.  I'm sick of eating out!  I'm really going to start and be more positive in my blog.  I'm always complaining and that's not how I normally am, but their is something about typing my day out that makes me remember the annoying things that happened to me.    My mom and I went shopping this afternoon and she bought me some new clothes at Aeropostale and I got this really cool reversible shirt at Yonkers.  Thanks, Mom!  Church was fun.  The Quissels' sat next to us tonight so that was nice, sitting next to someone you actually know.  Plus, the "cruton o' Christ' was yummy! hehehe!  Anyway...Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes Yes Lord!  Fun song that has entertaining hand gestures.  If you want I can demonstrate them for you sometime and you can laugh at them b/c they are really quite funny.    I finished my Lab Report (round of applause!)  Tomorrow morning I have a dentist appointment at 9 and an orthodontist appointment at 1.  I wonder when my braces are coming off.  Every time I go they say "oh, Kayla, you're so close"  I just want to tell them to either shut up or take them off!  My appointments are only two weeks apart now so maybe they are right.  Cross your fingers!    tata

      ugh...Today I woke up very early for a Saturday,  8 a.m.  I finished my history notes and then packed the rest of my room.  Countdown to new house is now at 5 days, but since most of the computers are getting packed tonight this might be the last entry for awhile that is undetermined as of now though.  I took a nap around 3 ish, naps are so wonderful!  Although I'm still not feeling my greatest.   When I came back from the mall last night I packed some more and watched stand up on comedy central.  I was laughing so hard at this guy...He was talking about church and when he went up to communion he called the body of Christ the "cruton o' Christ"...That cracks me up, hahaha!    I was bored so I decided to go online and read some blogs and see what was has been going on in my friends lives for the last week or so.  I was going in and out of folders when I came to Brad Dawson's blog.  My response to your comment on the incline of bogger users is:   1.  You're very immature if you're going to stop using a blog just because others are now using one.  2.  But if you  don't  like reading my blog, you  don't  have to .  Simple as that!  *thinking*  I don't feel very good.  I'm very tired.   I suppose I'll go to church tomorrow, but no confirmation so this makes me happy.  Although it is a lot better this year than previous years and to make it even better it's my last year!  I like having the O'Gorman kids with us, it makes for different people to look at.  Note*: Renae it's costing me $16 to get my bag fixed.  It's okay, I know it was an accident.  And you will not get a cold from being cold!  If I stay on for much longer I'm going to start babbling more about things people really don't care about or don't need to know.

      As I read through past entries I find that I complain an awful lot, talk about ppl I don't like, and then talk about the boys I just can't seem to get enough of.  This will not disappoint you. We'll start off with the complaining section 1. Study Hall=Study! Enough said if you need it explained to you then you're just like every moron that's in my study hall (no offense Renae) 2. People I don't like...What can I say about them today?   No one did anything particular that annoyed me besides the kids in my study hall. 3.  Didn't see boy capable of melting iceberg today. (tear)  Got a nod from Kurt.  The nod is a cheap way to say "hello" But, oh well, take what you can get, right?  Very uneventful otherwise.   Brett gave me a pamphlets to look at during reading period about democrats and Republicans which was extremely bias on every level because it was made by the Republican party.  So it was all bull shit.  But koodos to Brett for letting me read that.  I like that he gets into it like I do.  Must kids our age could give a rats ass about politics.   Which reminds me of something.  The news always talks about all the bad things kids do, what about the good things?  People think teenagers are so horrible.  WE ARE NOT!  I hate the stereotype that all teenagers are trouble makers.  I'm not!  I work my ass off in school give me a break!  I find it humorous that I can make such a boring day turn into a blog.   For Jessica, Renae and Erica's amusement:  Kurt is sooooo dreamy! haha...It makes me laugh too.  I really don't ever remember saying that but it makes you guys laugh so whatever.   Thanks Sean for listening to my complaining.  Word of advice, start your homework earlier!   ~tata

      Okay, so I just finished my 3 hours of history notes. ugh!  My dad tried to console me by saying "Well, Junior year is your hardest, Kayla."  Yeah, uh huh, didn't work.  What about at the beginning of the year when Mr. Denovon said students should have only 1 1/2 hours of homework a night, huh?  I'd be happy to only have an hour and a half.  And all those news reports I've been reading that say students don't have enough homework.  Ya wanna know what I have to say to those?  Of course you do.  Those people can kiss my ass while doing my 4 hours of homework, damnit! (angry mood)  I need a vacation BAD!

      Thursday...Well, we'll begin with the morning.  Moment that pops out in my head first is when Erica and I were talking in the JLab today and I was sitting in "well yeah's" seat and he came in and I said I was sorry for sitting in his seat and he said oh no you're fine and looked at me with those beautiful eyes...awww I just about melt.  Take that AJ!  Although I must admit that when I ever I'm around him I find it hard to form words...this could be bad.  Then we started an algebra test that was simple and the physics test was simple too, so now watch I'll get them both back and get a horrible score on both.  Life has a way of screwing you like that.  I finished my lit and comp essay and I pulled this one out of my butt so I will hopefully get a good grade on this one too.  Lunch was Lunch.  Chemistry was Chemistry.  Had an interesting Republican/Democrat debate in AP history with Brett Peterson.  I felt a bit bad cuz it was him (Republican) against Sindju, Reily and I (the Democrats)  If you've met me you know I'm a huge Democrat.  But it was all in fun.  I saw Stanley driving on my way home (rolls eyes)(and I'm almost positive that the girl with him was Holman....cues Renae to make the face and say the name) I find this kid annoying.  Dare I say more annoying then McPotty?  oh hell, yea!  I still have history notes to do....(thinks about the hours of work ahead of me) ...well,  ~tata

      Nothing happend today worth typing about.  (Going over the day in my head) ...Mine and Renae's commentary was published but I was too afriad to read it in print b/c of the fear of embarassment.  If you really want to know my opinion on Arnold Schwarzenegger you can im me b/c I fear my strong political opinion may be too long to keep your interest in my blog.  I did "eh..." on my AP History test.  If I'm still here tomorrow after my Physics and Algebra 2 tests and an AP Lit and Comp quiz I'll consider myself  very  lucky.  I'm sure I'm not the first to say this, but I hate physics 100%!  Now, not the class like the people in it but the material.  I must say Mike Anderson is growing on me. Their are too many formulas to work with.   After school I simi-walked out to my car with Ross, he said he was excited to go "jam".  okay.  But on my way home I drove slow b/c all that awaited me here was homework and we all know how fun that is.  When I drove by his house he was standing outside with Stanley.  If you say you don't like the kid why do you hand out with him, huh??  That's like me hanging out with McPotty, not gonna happen...EVER!   Well, that was a chipper note to end this on. ~bye

         Today was basically just there.  Nothing real important happened.  I had a stack of homework that I, for the most part, finished.  Well, now I guess this entry is just going to turn into a collection of complaints.    1.  AJ would you please, please find your strength to tear yourself away from Ben for just one class period and help me with the layout!  All you have to do is press the shift key, click on the text and press delete.  So simple a monkey could work it.  I know it will be difficult to break away from Ben but for the love of God just do IT!   2.  Now, Kurt, you think you can walk up to me and look all cute like and give me that look, with those adorable eyes and ask for gum and expect me to give it to you whenever you ask...well I guess you're absolutely right.  3. A school zone is 15 mi/hr...NOT 5 mi/hr!  When I was coming home today I was driving behind this truck that decided to go that slow.  But their were no children around and I understand his need to be caution but come on.  But that's not all, oh no, when he wanted to turn onto a residential street you need to yield to oncoming traffic but not if theirs nothing coming.  You don't need to stop, sit there for awhile and then go!  GRRRR! 4. HOMEWORK! Enough said!  ~god bless

         I keep thinking today is Wednesday, but it's not it's Monday.  Too bad.      I'll give you the recap of my day:  Algebra 2-learned about math, naturally.  But, I think the kid that sits next to me must have skipped his shower again this morning b/c he didn't smell too good.  Physics-I walked in to find half the class b4 me still taking their quiz I forgot about.(oops!)  In AP Lit and Comp, I sat down to only get asked by Brett Peterson "If our vocab test was gonna have all 60 words on it?"  My answer was, "What vocab test?"  Yes, I didn't know about the Unit vocab test, again(oops!) But, I think I did okay. Thank you, Brett!  Mrs. Benz read some essays aloud that we should models ours after and personally I think they were both boring as hell!  But on the second one, the kid said Voltaire and it reminded me of the "Princess Diaries"  When Lilly goes, "Voltaire, Voltaire, personally I'd like to learn about Voltaire!" And then Mia mouthed "Thank you"  I love that movie!  Why can't I be a princess and have a rock star boyfriend that just so happens to be the lead singer for Rooney?  My favorite part is at the end when they kiss and Mia's foot pops and all the lights go on in the garden. Awww...classic!     Anyways, Lunch was great like always!  I mean why wouldn't it be?  I get to "site see" And I must say this, Drew (Sean told me his name so it's right) can eat ALOT!  When Renae and I were standing in line he was walking back to his table with a tray of food and then when we were standing in line to pay for ours he was buying another meal.  So he got two b4 we got our one.  And I don't know where that kid puts it either!  Chemistry was uber easy!  AP History was uber boing...again.  And Newspaper was educational as always.  I learned how to fax today.  When I came back I helped Stephanie Tschetter edit Ben's commentary.  He typed French fires instead of french fries...hahaha that sill cracks me up!  It was hilarious.     Now, I am at home putting off writing my Literary Movement paper.  I've finished all of my other homework and should work on that paper.  But...eh...  ~tata

      Wow!  This is a feeling I haven't felt in a long time.  I have absolutely nothing to do!  NOTHING!    I went shopping with my mom this afternoon, which was um...Interesting.  We went into Christopher and Banks and let me just say I am not looking forward to reaching middle age and having to wearing that stuff.  If I ever say I think a sweater with a squirrel or a Halloween vest with pumpkins and cats on it is cute please hurt me!    I wish their was something decent on TV to watch.  Unfortunately, I don't count football decent or MTV cribs.  Someday, I want a house worthy of MTV cribs.  Wait...No, really I'd love to live in a penthouse in New York City that is lavishly furnished but very much a home at the same time.   Or, in one of those huge houses that is here (even tho I hate the winter with a passion!)  That would be nice!  Huge bedrooms, bathrooms, walk-in closets, and kitchen.  A movie theatre and a pool.  Defiantly Cribs worthy!  Alright I'm done rambling

      Recap of my weekend:  Friday:  School, yuck, enough said!  After school I went to the mall with Erica for something to do which proved to be drepressing on two accounts.  One, I only had $5 on me so I couldn't buy anything.  Two, Erica and I went to DEB and looked at formal dresses.    Saturday:  I had to babysit at 7:30 am, so I didn't get to sleep in like the rest of my peers.  Oh well, I survived.  Then I came home and packed boxes.  I know FUN!  After the excitement with the boxes I decided it was time to kick it up a notch and study for the PSAT more.   (Man, that book is humbling!)  Afterwards, Renae, Megan and I went to the mall, went to eat, to Best Buy and then to visit Sean at Hy-vee.  Everyone works at Hy-Vee I swear.  I saw Emily, that was nice.   After Hy-Vee we sorta drove around for a bit before I decided I wanted to go home.  Came home attempted more homework and then went to bed.  Sunday:  Sunday is consumed with more packing, church and any homework that still needs to be done!   ~tata

      Nine days since the last update.  Well they are just getting further and further apart now.  Last weeks confirmation was productive.  All I have left is one retreat and an interview and I am as good as confirmed.  Hope to see ya'll at that party!  We only had two days of school this week on account of the Thanksgiving holiday.  I wish parentview would work so I could see what I got on my history test.  Wednesday was there.  Jessica, Megan, Renae and I went to the mall for the opening of Hollister, because yes, we are just that sad.  But it is so cool in there and I think it is actually bigger than the one in the Mall of America.  On Thursday, we went to Todd and Carol's for Thanksgiving dinner.  It was weird because my dad and my aunt Tami were called into work, my cousins Courtney and Jon didn't come and it was the first holiday since my Grandpa Jimmy died.  It didn't feel like Thanksgiving.  My relatives seriously annoyed me to the point of pissing me off with their constant questions of wether or not I had a boyfriend or a date to formal.  Quite frankly if I wanted them to know that stuff I would have told them now wouldn't have I.  On Friday, I slept in.  I don't see the point in shopping the day after Thanksgiving.  So I stayed home and helped my mom.    For the last week I've been sorta sick.  Every time I eat something I get sick.  So needless to say I haven't ate much in a week.  It's not that I'm not hungry it's just that when I eat I'll get sick.  It is a strange illness.    Today is Saturday and I have yet to complete any homework that was assigned on Tuesday.  Oh well I still have Sunday.  Tonight, I guess Renae and I'll go to the mall with Megan and Jessica if they ever call back.  Then we'll come back to my house and watch a movie.  This is what is planned for now, but for some reason the plan always changes.  It makes life a bit more interesting.  Kurt said he'd talk to me about tonight but so far he hasn't called.  Oh on a side note, I hope Ross asks AJ out soon b/c I'm getting sick of talking about it and hearing about it!   I wish my mom would get home so we could go to best buy.  I have a list of cds I want to get.  But I know as soon as I get them my mom will take them away and say they're for Christmas.  Damn that!    ~tata

      So I updated on Monday and today is Thursday so I figured I better update this thing for the few ppl that read this.  School has been school.  I've been working my ass off to catch up on everything that I missed on Monday.  Today the Nationalist finally came out! YAY!  The Band Folk were all very pleased with Jessica and my article which was uplifting and Mr. Powers couldn't say enough good things about it.  This makes me very, very happy!  If the Band Folk hadn't of liked it, that would have been awful!  Newspaper was fun...but it always is.   And Renae...1.  I don't like him ;-)                     2. Why do I need new crushes?                     3. I'm a dick...I'm addicted to YOU! And Erica.....1. You do not have to make it your personal mission to get me a date to Winter formal. OKAY?!  I really have nothing much to say b/c my life has been uneventful the last few days.    toodles~

      Today I didn't feel well and decided to opt out of school.  I think I was just over tired because I slept from around 8 to 12.  I woke up feeling better but there was no real point in going to school for 3 periods.  Renae and Jess both called after school which was nice.  Renae to make sure I was okay and Jess the same but she called bearing bad news.  I will be doing homework until I die apparently.  I'll recap my weekend for ya'll because it was much more fascinating than my day.   On Friday: The fam and I went to the mall for supper where I saw Jason.  I think he must have been training for a job or something.  After the mall we came home and my Cousin Jeff, his kids, Emily and Justin and his girlfriend Christie came here from Spearfish to watch Christie's son play in the football tourny.  They came around 11:30 and they were so loud talking to my parents until around 2 in the morning I didn't fall asleep until they all went to bed.    Saturday: I had to babysit at 7 and was not happy with my 6:30 wake up call.  When I got home at 12:30 I ate a bit, then showered.  Next, I took a nap until my dad called at 6 to tell me to start getting ready cuz Renae would be on her way soon.  Renae got lost coming over to my house, which is okay because everyone seems to the first time.  She found it tho and we were off to Black Sheep, 45 minutes early.  We thought we were smart and would get a place to sit down.  We couldn't have been more wrong!  By the time we got there it was already standing room only.  GRRR!  If Kurt wouldn't have moved their is no way we would have got to see the band.  They were awesome by the way! The bass player was so HOTT!  After Rookie of the Year was done, Renae and I decided to leave and go to Hy-Vee cuz I wanted to find out if Sean had our tickets yet. Plus, we were hot and sick of standing by that time anyway.  Do you think Sean would have our tickets. no! Sean didn't have the tickets!  Whatever!  So we thought we'd catch the last few songs of Spill Canvas and went back.  We got there just in time to see everyone walking out, yea we know we're cool.  But it was fun we stayed and talked to Kurt, Ross,surprisingly, Joe and some other kids that were in that huddle but I don't recall whom.  On the car ride home Eaner and I agreed we had loads of fun.  But our Guests didn't get back from the game until 1 in the morning so it was another late night!  GRRR  Sunday: Woke up around 10 against my will.  If I would of had my way I would have stayed in bed all day.  But NOOOO...We all went out for lunch at Ruby Tuesday and Renae was there with her dad so that was a bit funny.  After lunch we went out to my big bro's house for Andy's b-day party.  My baby is now 6.  Sentimental tear!  Then we came home I wrote my lit and comp paper and did my history notes until it was time to go to church.    Fun weekend all in all but it defiantly wore me out.

      I guess I have to come to terms with summer being over.  I'm still in denial, I admit it!  But for about a month or so I've discovered my tan slowly fading away to nothingness.  I still see the marks from my swimsuit but still you can't tell I ever had a tan and I am now returning to pale flaky skin which I've named "Winter Skin."  I hate winter!    School was schoolish today.  Well, duh!  New seating arrangements in both AP Lit and Comp and Chemistry.  Why must teachers change things up on me.  I would welcome the change in Algebra but I was fine in the other classes.  Mr. Powers was real testy today!  What else is new?    After school, Renae and I ran to the flower shop so she could buy some flowers for Ashley Blake's B-Day on Friday, to Best Buy, and Wal-Mart.  I love going to Best Buy.  Even tho I rarely have money with me to buy something I just like to look...That and Barnes and Nobles.  Yeah, I know, I'm a geek!    History notes are dumb.  I was watching Dashboard Confessional on TV when my grandma called tonight.  I love Dashboard, they are just so...Wonderful.  But she called in the middle of the show...grrr!  I guess my Aunt Lynda moved into town without telling anyone.  Huh.  Then my mom called my Uncle Todd to inform him of this.  They started talking about Thanksgiving and Christmas when my Uncle said he didn't know if their was going to be a Person Christmas this year b/c they were going to be gone for band and my Uncle Terry is going to be in Colorado.  GRRR!  We always have Person Christmas...like since the beginning of time!  If we don't have Christmas together this year because of fucking band I will be pissed!      You know how some people are dreaming of a white Christmas?  Well, right now I'm dreaming of a tropical vacation spot because I think I need a vacation!  Thinking of the warmer climates....

      Don't you just hate it on your day off you're supposed to sleep in, but the mom of the house decides to be insanely loud and prevents this!  I DO!  I went to school at 10:30 to work on the Nationalist.  That went well, I did a bunch of photo editing which Mr. Powers taught me how to do and then sorta left me to do on my own.  I was a bit scared I'd mess it up or wouldn't do it right because he's real picky about everything.  But after that I drove to the Orthodontist.  Yuck!  The lady was real bitchy.  I got a lecture about how I should wear my rubberbands more.  Maybe it's the inner rebel in me, but I hate wearing them and at times downright refuse to!  When I came home I did homework which is always fun to do on your day off from school.  I fell asleep at around 4 and woke up around 7 in time for '8 Simple Rules.' I love that show.  It is so sad that John Ritter died.    Comments on Renae's Blog: I am not a freak!  Well, yes I am a neat freak but not a freak!  On the occasion of Ross...we are very disappointed.    Britney Spears drives me insane!  I can't believe that someone could make a career out of dancing because Lord knows she can't sing.  How is dancing helping humanity?  How is it contributing to society?  It's not!    Tomorrow is my nephew, Andy's, birthday.  He'll be 6.   I love my nephews to death!  Funny enough, I still have the crown from my 6th birthday at daycare.  Because my birthday is in the summer, so I wasn't in school.  I love having a summer birthday...I get no homework!   I can't wait till Saturday night we're gonna have so much fun!  What's the countdown now, Renae, 3 days?    I think I'm gonna go get some more sleep now.  Good Night!

      Since nothing real significant happened over the weekend that made me want to type in my blog I won't type anything about it.  We'll start with today.   1. I still really hate where I sit in Algebra!  Can you say new seating arrangement? 2. Physics is...Well...ya know math in the form of science.   3. vocab quiz yay!  I hate those things b/c like Jason said when are you ever gonna say those words? 4. Took my chemistry test in the learning center so I could go to Renaissance 5th period.  I also ran the paper with Teddy.  And I will now get good karma like Nikki would say and say something nice.  Teddy was really nice to me today.  I find it very humorous that ppl think I was in Acc English 1 and 2.  Sorry ppls I was in the regular class.  But she said I had a high vocabulary but as I reflect on mine,  I really don't think so.  I also found it odd that we both argeed that Nikki was a drama queen.  Teddy is Nikki's best friend and even she said it.   5. Renaissance was good.  I like pizza, but then again who doesn't?  Mrs. Hanson let Renae and I go back to her study hall since we had already done the things in our classes that needed to be done.  That was fun! I wish I could ditch Chemistry everyday and go to ULE.  Their are no fun kids in ULE 4th period.  Although if I for some reason went to ULE 4th period I would not see Hot Boy that's not so Hot Boy anymore b/c he got a hair cut.  I hope it grows back real quick like.  Lexi does not need to know his name nor does anyone else.  Especially AJ b/c then she'd tell him.   6. The essay test for history.  OMG!  Thank God my hand is still attached.  7. Newspapery stuff.  I said it once and I'll say it again. Joe Beck is a really nice kid,  This is why he's friends with everybody b/c he's a nice kid.  He commented on my AP History book (Which alot of ppl have and I don't know why), but then we started talking about it and how he didn't take the AP test but still got an A in the class.  I wish I had an A in that class.  I mean you fail one test and your wonderful grade goes done the crapper.    oh and Ross-What the hell?

      We won't review Thursday b/c it wasn't all that interesting b/c if it was I would remember something to put here and neither was today's school day so we'll start after school let out...Renae, Jessica, Lizzie and I went to Ruby Tuesday which was excellent! Sorry Jason, we didn't go to Calver's.  We all had wonderful laughs over lunch tho.  After lunch, Lizzie and I went to pick up her contacts and then we went to Best Buy.  That is a wonderful store, I could sit there for hours just looking at the stuff.  Then we went to the mall.  That wasn't much to talk about, it was there still for those that were wondering.  After the mall she dropped me off at school so I could get my car and then I came home.   Once I got home around 5ish, I did my Algebra which is super easy.  I find it ironic that we are learning about Matrices the same time the movie came out.  But after that, Lizzie and I decided we wanted to go to a movie, School Of Rock!   That was an awesome movie.  It was really inspiring to just want to be a rock star.  Watch the movie, you'll get it.  So yea...That was my Friday.  Tomorrow night I have to babysit, which is never any fun, but atleast I'll have money then b/c I'm currently running on $2.   I have to share something with you all that I thought was really funny.  In my horoscope in the latest Seventeen, the last sentence says "After all you could be in love soon"  I laugh at this.  This is me laughing. "Hahahahaha"  Sorta off subject, but Lizzie was showing me her formal dress and it was so pretty I want to go! (Has spoiled girl pout on my face)  I'm happy this weekend I don't have to dedicate my weekend to homework, I can actually live a bit.    But now I'm done typing.  Night!

      I don't know what to write about...I could go through my day but that just seems so normal.  Eh, I'll go for it.    Before school:  Sean and all his friends came in, in their adorable suits for the matrix movie.  I don't understand the dressing up but they looked nice and whatever toots your horn.  Renae, then sacrificed herself to the hot hy-vee guy.  (How dare you AJ?  That's my nickname for him.   1. Algebra 2- took a test didn't finish, will do tomorrow. 2. Physics-First time I have come dangerously close to falling asleep in that class.  But I didn't feel very good in the morning so maybe that's why. 3. AP Lit and Comp- Took a test, which I don't think I did too well on.  But, thankfully my hand is still attached because we had to write a lot! 4. Lunch/Study-nothing 5. Chemistry- Chemistry stuff 6. AP History- Found out our test on Monday is going to be a huge essay test with one essay prompt and she gave us all the things we have to write about. Now if only I knew something about them.  I really need to read the chapters! 7. Newspaper- Did newspaper stuff.  I hope I saved my layout! I don't remember if I did before the lights went out.  Oh, and Joe Beck...nice kid!    After school- came home and was kinda grumpy, don't know why but was.  Thankfully, I finished my homework in time to watch some tv tonight.    Now I'm off to go talk to me amigos.  (Sorry Renae but Mr. Powers inspired me to use my Spanish)

      Do you ever find yourself sitting there, talking to yourself?  Okay...No?  Well, then I'm just special.  We are going to start today's entry with a moment of silence for Hot Boy's hair. *sush, silence*  Why did he cut it?  I don't know.  He can no longer be called Hot Boy.  You were so right, Renae.    I'm not going to bother going period by period through my day because it wasn't that interesting at all.  Everyone had issues today.  Jessica had her car "bump," Megan had her driving test, and Lizzie had her enemy at school.  I had no major issue which doesn't bother me a bit.    For the first time this winter season, I had to wear my winter coat to school.  It was very interesting when it came to choose a parking space cuz I couldn't see the lines.  Then after school, coming outside to find ice on the car and having to scrape it off (which was a lot of work for such a small girl I may add) was a big surprise.  Ick to winter!  I hate winter!  Goodnight all!

      Today was not too exciting.  It consisted of church and that's about it.  Well, we can stick physics homework in there too.  So we'll do tidbits brought to you by me...  1.  I'm getting this sick feeling that winter formal is going to be a repeat of the last two years.  No date, no go, and no dress.    2.  Chocolate should be it's own food group.  Yes, Jessica, I too think it should have it's own pyramid.  Theirs Dark Chocolate, Milk Chocolate, White Chocolate, chocolate with nuts, chocolate covered fruit.  Although, I do believe that chocolate and veggies are a no no.  Mostly because I don't believe that something I hate can go with something I love.    3. Christmas is the most wonderfullest holiday ever.  Why does it only have to come once a year?  Yes, yes I know the religious aspect of it, but still.    4. I love the 80's is Emmy worthy program.  If you have not watched an episode you are missing out!  5. I'm not really sure who all reads this because it is on the internet.  But I'm thinking it is around 2 people.  So to those who are reading this...I don't know wether to thank you or wonder if you have enough to do?  6. Why is it that when you need something dressy to wear to an event you never have anything and when you do have something to wear you have nothing to wear it to?  7.  Renae, this one stems from your "I'm never getting married" thing.  Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get married.  I look at all the divorced people I know and wonder if someday I'll be like them. God forbid, that's the last thing I want, but I wonder if you can love someone the same or even more than the day you said "I do."  I look at my grandparents who've been married for 53 years and think "do you still love him/her the same or more than you did the day of your wedding?"  Or my parents who've been married for 18 years.  I can only pray to have that kind of marriage when I'm older.  Maybe it's because I've never been in love that I'm so critical of the whole thing.    8. Tidbit # 7 really dug deep in my head.  9.  I think that guy from American Idol (I've never actually watched that show, tho)  Clay whatshisbutt is gay.    10.  People who mix math with science are sneaky.  They said Physics was a science class but I think I'm doing more math in there then I am in my Algebra 2 class!  Goodnight and God bless!

      Well, yesterday I stayed home sick.  I don't know about you, but when ever I stay home sick I feel guilty for some reason.  But I did and slept most of the day away yesterday.  My dog woke me up this morning at 7:30, but it was so funny.  My dad had set the mirror he bought for my room against the wall and my dog kept going up to it and backing away and going up to it and backing away.  Even though I was mad at him for waking me up so early it was very funny.    Then once I got up the strength to roll out of bed I took a shower and did some physics and Algebra homework.  Physics is a lot easier this chapter, I'm glad.  But I still need your book Renae!  Then after that, my parents came home from god knows where and my mom started in on me about helping around the house.  She says all I do is sit and watch TV.  Whatever!  I have yet to sit and watch an entire TV show from beginning to end since school began with the exception of my sick day, which doesn't count.  If parents only knew all the work we kids do.  I mean if parents were to switch lives with us for a day I bet they'd be happy to take their old life's back!  Adults these days have no idea.  I think my mom is in the "must clean" mood b/c my grandparents are coming down and my mom's mom has this thing about everything being clean.    I must tell everyone that the play was amazing.  I wish I could go again before it's over but I don't think I can.  But it was good.  Forget Joel, Sean you were great!    Halloween is a wonderful day...When you are a kid.  It has lost it's luster.  Maybe it's because I didn't get to enjoy it this year?  I feel so bad you guys.  The next day Renae has off we will have a movie night at my house I promise!  We'll have pizza and popcorn or whatever else ya'll want.  But I have one request....Please don't make me watch a scary movie!    ~tata

      So basically we're just gonna skip yesterday because I was sick and didn't get out of bed all day.  But onto today.  Woke up to a balling baby...yep that's right my mom does daycare. ugh!  I ate then took a shower.  After my shower I worked on my Lit and Comp test which sucked by the way.  (homework in general sucks!)  I drove to Lewis around noon to mail a letter for my mom because we don't have an actual mailbox out here.  Apparently we aren't considered developed yet.  But yeah...came home worked on Lit and Comp some more and watched some tv in there.  Then I got ready to go to the Witness/The Spill Canvas/Kelpie show.  Although Becky came late and wanted to sit on the ledge but my chair was in her way so what did she do?  She picked up my chair with me in it and moved it.  Gosh if you would have gotten there earlier you wouldn't have to worry about where you're gonna park your fat ass!  Ugh...people piss me off sometimes!  Witness and The Spill Canvas rocked as always but Kelpie was not so good, I didn't like them.  The lead singer resembled a Red Neck so much.  He had overalls on with a red shirt and long hair with a beard.  I half expected him to take out a jug and start blowing into in and call for alligators.  There was this boy in a green shirt that played with Kelpie though.  He played the keyboard and guitar, he was hot!  He was hopable!  Witness was amazing.  I agree, Renae, Witness is better instrumentally but lyrically The Spill Canvas wins.  I wish Peter would turn around once in awhile and face the audience when he plays though.  I was disappointed that Nick didn't play The Tide too.  I love that song.  The line that goes, "Heaven's not a place you go when you die it's, that moment in life when you actually feel alive."  Aww...that just gets me.  Joe seemed more relaxed tonight than he did on Saturday.  Afterwards since it ended sooner then we expected it to and we told our parents we weren't gonna be home till 10:30, and we had no intentions of going home early, we just bummed around town.  We ended up at Wal-Mart. (I hate Wal-Mart) Then to Hy-Vee where we began a sandwich hunt and since the deli was closed on account of it being 9:30 we left and traveled to Burger King.  We ate at Burger King just fine but when it came time to leave we were locked in.  Leave it to Renae, Megan and I to get locked in a Burger King.  The nice guy that was working unlocked the door for us.  oh fun times.  Good night everyone and God Bless!

      Oh fun day!  Company left.  Tonight Renae, Jessica, Megan, Alishia and I went to see Spill Canvas at Cool Beans.  Jessica left b4 it started b/c she's still sick.  I talked with Joe a bit and got a huge wave from the Hot Hy-Vee guy  ;-) (*huge smiles*).  I don't know what you're talking about Renae...saw me look where?  I must say I loved that song The Tide, the line that goes "Heaven's not a place that you go when you die.  It's that moment in life when you actually feel alive."  Aww....  After that Renae, Megan and I went to the O'G vs. RHS boys bball game.  We stayed for all of a quarter and a half.  Then left to go back to Cool Beans b/c Renae wanted a Sandwich but once we got there she decided against it and since I wanted Arby's that's where we went.  Erica was working and we got to talk to her a bit.  When we finished Arby's I brought Megan home and then returned Renae to her car at my house.  But on the ride back to Megan's we went by the "Chevy Chase" house, which is so bright you can see it from outerspace!  But on the way Renae declared she wanted to go to a club, not just a club but a bar.  This landed on her profile tonight: moment of the day:  me- "I wanna go to a bar!"  kayla- "WE'RE NOT 21, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU RENAE!"  ah good times.    The night received a 9! God Bless!

      Merry Christmas all you out in Bloggerland!  I got a haul this year:   From my Friends:  Megan gave me a gift certificate to the mall; Jessica gave me this really cute key chain, a candle and an air freshener; and Emily gave me lotion.  From Brian, Tami, Andy and Alex:  Best Buy gift card and a bag of candy  Mom and Dad/Santa Clause:  cds, clothes, a palm poilt, purse, seat covers, calender, two belts and jewelry  Person Christmas:  a Mickey Mouse purse and lotion  Weber Christmas:  gloves, socks, dispolable camera, gift certificate to Burger King (yum!), gift card to American Eagle, and $50 from Grandma and Grandpa  Christmas is wonderful.  Their are so many people at my house right now.  Brian and Andy are staying the night.  That is a bit odd because I don't think Brian has stayed the night sense he moved out some 10 years ago.  But it is nice to have my brother at home again.  I suppose I'll have to go shopping with my mom and aunts tomorrow.  This could be boring but could also be fun, we'll have to see.    Oh funny story that may not be such a funny story.  So I was talking to Rachael the girl I was babysitting for and I told her that I heard her grandma was really sick with a cold (her grandma and my grandma are sisters) and I also mentioned that my mom was sick and might have influenza A and that was why I didn't want her too close to me.  Well Rachael turned around and told her mom that her grandma had cancer.  Needless to say I got a phone call.  How she got cancer from a cold is beyond me.  My mom thinks she thought Influenza was cancer.  But yeah now I have to watch what I say apparently.    I want to be vauge in my blog too, like Lizzie is in her's and Brad is in his sometimes.  There are people in this world that will stab you in the back and then there are people that are there watching for them ready to turn the knife around.  So no matter what just know someone always has your back!

      Today, I babysat for Rachael and Jason.  Not exactly my choice day for Christmas vacation but whatever it's money.  I'll do the same tomorrow.  I worked steadily all day on my history notes and still am not done.  I'll work tomorrow on them too I suppose.  Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.  We'll open our presents then because the Webers will all be over on Christmas Day.  Well maybe they won't.  Mom is really sick and may have Influenza A.  So Christmas is sorta up in the air at the moment.  Christmas Eve mass at church will be packed at 10.  It always is.  I better go to bed though because I have to get up early again tomorrow.  But before I go I have something else to say...  I ment to update yesterday because I had something really important to get off my mind but I fell asleep before I got the chance.  Yesterday, I was switching through the channels and I came across Oprah.  On the show she and her staff traveled to South Africa and gave a Christmas party to all the children orphaned by AIDS.  This was truly an emotional show.  I cried as I watched these children become so happy after receiving clothes, toys, food and shoes.  Those children are so much braver than I could ever be.  They have lived through so much in so many short years.  For some of them, it was their first Christmas, pair of shoes and photograph of themselves.  Oprah had a brief biography with a few of her guest and they nothing short of inspiring.  All I could think about was how I could help them.   Sitting there watching the television I just sat and wondered what I did to deserve what I have.  I know one thing...Whatever I get tomorrow night for Christmas, I don't deserve.  To everyone reading this, thank God right now for everything you have!

      In the life of me: Today I got a haircut at like 10 in the morning.  I like it...It's much shorter although no one else can tell cept me.  Then I came home and took a shower.  After that....I don't really remember that so moving on to church.  We went.  Then when we got home Brian, Tami, Andy and Alex came over and we ate pizza and exchanged Christmas presents. Next, Renae came over and I drove to Lizzie's house.  She had a Christmas get together there. Jessica, Renae and I entertained ourselves.  Good Times that was.  I have Kodak proof.  After Jess left, we felt very alone.  Around 10:15ish Renae and I decided to hit the gas stations in the area and basically discovered a new loop so if ya'll want, a new loop has been started and Renae and I were the founders of it!  I still think we need our own reality show!  It would be awesome!  If people could only be with us when we are together they would be afraid for their lives.    Last night I went to the boys b-ball game with Emily.  That was fun.  The game was close the entire game but we ended up losing in overtime.  That sucked but the crowd was really into it so it made it that much better.  I still don't understand why Tony Upkie got to play?  If you're caught w/ drinking and driving and drugs, get kicked off the football team because of which, why do you get to play on the basketball team? I saw Joe there, too.  Oh, Oh but the best part was...Malibu Ken was there!  He's a CHEERLEADER!  He's got long hair now and he's a cheerleader!  Maybe I need to explain him to everyone that does not know him.  During summer gym going into our first year in high school Tyson, Lizzie, Jessica, Erica and I didn't and couldn't of possibly known everyone's name in the classes so we made up names for some kids.   This one kid was Malibu Ken b/c well he looked like Malibu Ken.  FYI: There was a Malibu Barbie too! haha.  But everyone kept saying he was gay.  One time I had to be his partner in some basketball drills and he through the ball to me and asked if that was too hard.  Sweet guy but yea I thought it was nice to see him again but weird to see him as a cheerleader.    I'll talk to you later blog.  If I survive Person Christmas, anyway.  Cross your fingers!

      Hello there world!  This morning I woke up and went to school, but first I picked Megan up.  Today was the last day, oh tear.  Algebra sucked b/c Mrs. Kultz told us we could take our test as a group in our pod.  Well that doesn't help me b/c their all stupid and don't get it.  GEEZ! One tries to do it the other copies off him and gets them all wrong and then another just doesn't do the homework.  Plus, two smell really bad!  This did not please me at all!  Physics was Physics like, as was Lit and Comp.  Lunch was yummy.  I'm beginning to really like those baked potatoes.  Chemistry was fun, I like Jack as a lab partner he makes it more enjoyable.  History was boring! That class is what made me tired.  I missed Renae in Newspaper b/c she had to leave for an appointment that started a half hour after school got out?  I don't get it and I'm sure you don't either.      After school, I got my PSAT results back.  I didn't do as good as others but then again I did better than some too.  I was sorta in the middle.  But then I helped Jessica make up her Physics lab because this one was so fun.  When we came in Chad was in there.  He was speaking in an English accent.  Wow that was funny.  Also seeing him try to do the bending and picking up of the chair part of the lab was hilarious!  Thanks Renae for sticking up for my Blog!  I hate having to censor myself on a place that is supposed to be open for me to express myself!  Night all!

      Today I'm going to start off with a quote for Self-Reliance by Ralph Waldo Emerson: "It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude....."  I love this quote because it is so true.  It's easy to have our own opinion when we are by oursevles but when we're in a group it is just as easy to conform to their opinions.  But a truly great person is one that can keep their own opinions and be true to themselves even in a large crowd.    I woke up feeling like shit today.  Came to school even though I was sick.  I need to learn!  I felt better after lunch though.  But I fell asleep when I got home, did some Algebra, took a shower and ate something b/c I wasn't feeling well again.  My mom suggested that since it worked earlier in the day.  I have a 100 temp.  UGH!  I hate being sick!  But don't fret my friends I will be in school tomorrow unless I'm like throwing up or something.    I'm getting really excited for Lizzie's party on Saturday!    Lexi told me today that she was reading my blog (Hi Lexi) and that I seem very different on it.  I thought about it and what I write on here is what I think and at school I'm too polite and my parents have taught me better than to say these things to those people (When I talk about people).  I type them here so I get them out.  But I do believe that what I say on here is closer to who I am than who I am at school b/c I'm not afraid to hold back on.  But I would never put something extremely bad on here either.  Now I'm sorta contradicting myself. Oh, this brings me to another Emerson qoute: "To be great is to be misunderstood."  Maybe I'm just misunderstood?  I don't know.  Bottom line: Lexi is right, I am different on here than I am at school.    Oh, I am tired.  Time to go to bed.    P.S. Newspaper was a fun day today.

      A recap of the weekend:   Friday: The play was really good, although I felt it ran a bit long and some parts could have been omitted.  But that is my opinion.  Saw Ross and Kurt there and Lizzie decided not to join Jessica and I but opt to join Chad to LHS's play instead.  After the play I drove home and worked on my AP History project till 1:00 a.m.  Saturday: I had my final confirmation meeting with Susan.  Thank God it was with Susan b/c I don't think I was prepared to have one with Father.  I passed with flying colors.  When I got home my mom and I went shopping so she could finally get off my case about not having presents for me.  The mall and Best Buy were insane!  Looking back...between Renae and my dad I don't think their was a time where I wasn't on my cell phone or it was ringing during my shopping trip with the moms.  When we got home it was time for Renae to come over and pick me up so we could use her free tickets to the Skyforce game.  I remember a time when they were actually good.  They suck now!  So do the Skyleaders.  Not ment to be racist but if you're gonna act black and shake your booty you better have a booty to shake Skyleaders!  After the game we went to Hy-Vee so Alisha could get chapstick and then we saw AJ (the boy) and decided to follow him.  Although we lost him b/c he drives really fast.  Even though Renae was huhum...speeding, we didn't catch up.  Then we found Ross and Kurt and followed them.  Fun times.  Met up with them at the stop light, followed them to Chance's house and then to the gas station.  We sorta mingled at the Gas Sations.  After Ross and Kurt I came home and worked on my AP History project till 12:30 a.m.  Sunday: I had a retreat at church from 1 to 8.  Confirmation is on January 11th, you'll have to come!  I was happy b/c the boy that was in my group for our normal classes was in my group for retreat and wow I have a crush on him.  Too bad he goes to O'G!  He's a drummer too!  This is the one you would approve of Renae, the one in the really sucky band but is forgiven for being in the sucky band b/c he's beautiful and plays the drums.  Sorta like hot boy that's not so hot boy anymore b/c he got a haircut.   When I came home I worked on my, guess what, AP History project.      Today was Monday.  I'm sure you already know that though.  Not much happened today.  Mr. P went crazy on Renae, Alisha and I after he found out about our speeding.  Oh well that was a bit funny.  We had fun googlism-ing our names in Newspaper.  I know productive.  I bet we'll have school tomorrow despite the blowing wind, snow and praying done by every student tonight.    Goodnight all!

      Okay so I was scolded for not updating my blog last night by Renae and promised an update today.  Since I have some time b4 I'm to leave and pick up Lizzie to meet Jessica at school to see Harvey I decided it'd be a perfect time to do this.  I wish I could tell you all good news but I just can't.  This week has sucked!  The description Renae used was a "suicidal week" and it fit really well.  Even though we aren't so don't get worried people.  Monday sucked b/c I was sick, coming down with a cold.  Tuesday sucked b/c I had a doctors appointment and am now on meds but also have to go back in over Christmas break and get a blood test so they can check for diabetes.  Which in all honesty I am very afraid to see the results of considering I have a lot of the symptoms and it is very common in my family.  Wednesday sucked b/c...well I just don't want to get into it but I would like to say I went through all the emotions you go threw when someone dies even though no one died and also to thank Sean for ruining my day.  (jk Sean I love you anyway)  Thursday sucked b/c...it just did.  Today sucked b/c the rest of the days in the week sucked so it felt the need to follow along.  Today in study hall when Renae declared it was a suicidal week Mr. P was sitting there and he got so scared and concerned.  Nikki being the brain she is asked if Renae wanted to talk to someone on suicide task force and Renae responded with "I am suicide task force!"  AH good times.  Oh well next week is another week right?  I'm sure it will be much better.  But today Powers basically let us do whatever, I'm thinking b/c he knew we were in a bad mood.  We FINALLY got to eat lunch on those cool tables no one knows the purpose of.   And he didn't say a word when he saw us on the internet in Newspaper.  Also I would just like to add that Renae you can to see the paper cut on my nose!  You see for all the ppl that weren't there to hear my screams, Renae got wild with the paper today and was talking with her hands and whipped me in the face with the paper and I screamed and I'm almost positive everyone looked at me in the hall but it hurt really bad.  You have no idea what it's like to have a paper cut on your nose.    This update is too long to add an a person of the day so I'm just not going to today.    I believe I'm coming down with Senioritis.  This is bad b/c it isn't even second semester of my junior year yet.    I'm kinda tired...  If I put the 101 things that are on my mind right now or at any time this would be very, very long.  My head is spinning with things but I think I better quit typing for now.  If you want to talk to me you now how to get me.

      God Bless snow days!  This was unexpected but welcome.  Blogger I realized that I tell you about my day, day after day, but I never really tell you about me or the people in my life.  So I decided that I should start doing that so you can get to know me better.  Since I am such a brilliant person I've decided to instate  a person of the day  section of my blog.     Today's lucky person is going to be my older brother Brian.  My brother and I are 13 years apart.  Yes, I know that is a lot but we get along better than most siblings I think.  In fact their has been several occasions when I wanted my younger brother and Brian to trade places...Brian come back and live at home and Tyler can move out.  Hey why not?  Brian is married to a wonderful woman that I'm proud to call my sister-in-law named Tami.  They were married in Las Vegas during the summer before my 5th grade year.  (I must say Las Vegas is an interesting place but can't really reach it's full fun potential unless you're 21)  Since then, they've had two boys.  My friends, still think that's strange that I'm an aunt but I love it!  Andy was born when I was in the 5th grade and Alex was born a year and a half ago.  Over the summer Brian under went brain surgery.  The hole connecting his spine to his brain was growing shut and needed to be reopened.  After two surgeries and several weeks of rest, Brian is back to normal.  You never really know how much someone means to you until you almost lose them.  I'm very thankful for my older brother.  Although I don't always talk to him everyday, I know he's there.  I love you!  Disclaimer: This doesn't tell everything about my brother.  Honestly there is too much to tell and my fingers get tired from typing a lot.    I have an award to give out on this wonderful day of school cancellation.  No, no, it has nothing to do with school.  This award is given to Hoobastank for having the best band name.  Wow! It is just so much fun to say!  Okay now everybody...HOOBASTANK!  I just love that name.  I've always thought that but have never really come out and said it.  So now I'll say it...they have the coolest name!  I hope the rest of you out there in cyber space have a wonderful snow day and use it to it's full potential!

      Today was like every other dreaded Monday.  I anticipated having to call in sick today considering that I was sick all weekend.  But I prevailed and went to school sick anyway in seek of knowlegde.  I have to LEARN!  However, Renae was gone and I was forced to fend for myself at Lunch and in Newspaper.  A lot of people were gone today though.    Well I found that people do actually read my blog and ask questions.  Huh...didn't think that would happen.  But, ah yes, I have another crush in newspaper class.  But it's just that a crush, nothing more.  No need to question further.    School was very boring today.  I missed you Eaner!  No Eaner to brighten me up at the end of the day.  I needed that too.  Being sick and going to school are not two things that go together.  But alas I assume I'll be there again tomorrow infecting the rest of the student body.  Because, frankly, if I have to be miserable with a cold others should have to be too.    I'm on break form my history homework.  Yes, Kate, my homework consists of notes.  I hate it when she hears about that starts to laugh like it's funny.  I don't laugh at her homework now do I?  No!  So leave me alone!  Okay so I have issues, I know.  Doesn't everybody though?    huh...maybe if I think of something profound to say b4 the night is over I'll pop back on but otherwise...until next time!

      Hello there all of three people that read my blog.  Yesterday, Renae, Lizzie, and Mary Katharine went to the Madrigal dinner.  As a whole it was not as good as last years performance.  The food was bad, I thought.  I liked the Jester performance.  Although, I suppose I'm a bit bias.  I will admit it was fun getting all dressed up.  After the Madrigal Renae and I hung out with Lizzie and Sean for a tad bit and sorta just drove around and did random things.  Such as photo developing and socializing.  Also on Friday I admitted somethings to myself that I'm not sure I'd like to repeat and therefore choose not to on the internet.  But they say the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem so maybe by admitting these things (even though I wouldn't classify them as a problem) I can overcome them.    Today my mother woke me at noon to tell me that we were going out to the mall because she wanted to be done with Christmas shopping.  Normally I think the mall should be a happy place.  I mean Santa is there and today they had carolers and a 4-piece band playing.  But the mall is not such a happy place.  Having to wait 20 minutes to try something on and then another 30 to pay for it does not make me happy.  Once I convinced my mom that we would shop another day we came home.   I really need to do some homework.  This still means I'll do it tomorrow.  At the moment I'm sorta stuck at home with my brother.  The Person parents went out tonight and asked me to stay home with the lil' bro.  So I'm here.  Writing in this.  Ya I'm cool I know.  ~tata

      I have something on my mind and wish to get it off.  I believe that Christmas has become too commercialized.   Now, I'm sure it was when I was a child too but now I realize it and see it more than ever.  Christmas is a time to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, the coming of our Savior.  Christmas is not about Santa Clause coming to your house and delivering presents with the help of reindeer.  Sorry to burst your bubble for those who still believe but that is all made up and kids get too wrapped up in it.  The manipulations that go on between parent and child around Christmas are insane.  "Jonny be good now Santa Clause is watching you!"  "Mommy, Mommy, Mommy if Santa Clause doesn't bring me this for Christmas I'm not going to believe in him anymore."  Children have no comprehension of the fact that the Santa Mom is talking about is God.  But God doesn't just watch you over Christmas but he watches you ALWAYS!  Children should be good always because God is watching them.  Society needs to make an effort to educated children on the real reason we celebrate Christmas instead of the fabricated version that has evolved over generations!

      I'm sorry to disappoint all my avid readers, but this entry will not be too interesting because I'm having a sorta "deer in the headlights" moments.  I wish it were summer.  Not for the obvious reasons of warm weather and no school, but so I could stay up late and go outside and look at the stars.  There's just something about the stars that has always fascinated me.  Looking up at them, I find myself lost in my own thoughts.  There's an entire world out there that we are completely unaware of.  Their could be another planet out there, that supports life billions upon billions of miles away, where they too, look up at their sky and wonder if we exist.  When you look up at the sky and think about your problems that you encounter from day to day in your life they don't seem so big anymore.   Some people need to look up at the stars and realize for the first time that they are not the center of the Universe.  This may lead them to believe that their world is crashing down on them, but in reality, their world is just beginning.  Don't go through life thinking you're better than anyone else.  Always remember, that the homeless person on the street is just as good as you are.

         School wasn't called off and it wasn't even an hour late, which meant that me and my little car were forced to face the bitterly cold weather and the six inches of snow that covered the roadways.  Today at school, I had a very traumatizing morning.  I was injured!  This girl thought she could get through the doorway the same time I could and ended up pushing me into the pushy bar to open up the door on account of she was much bigger than I am.  My poor hand got a huge mark on it and swelled up all morning.  Now, I am left with a mark and it hurts!  This afternoon I brought Jessica home and it took us around a half hour just to get out of the parking lot.  UGH!  Tonight, my mom made me to the dishes while she and my day went to my brother's band concert.  When she came back, I had everything done except the silverware that had peanut butter all over them.  So she asked me or rather yelled, why I didn't do the ones with peanut butter on them.  My response, "Those ones were icky!"  But you see I did attempt them, but the smell of the disgusting peanut butter was overwhelming and I couldn't take it anymore.  I hate peanut butter!  It's sometimes okay with chocolate and sometimes okay on toast but otherwise it is just gross.  My mom then proceeded on to say, what if my roommate in college liked peanut butter?  I answered, "Then she can eat it outside."  But she couldn't leave it alone, she added, "What about your kids, are you going to deprive them of peanut butter just because you don't like it?"  My come back, "Yes."  Now, don't get your undies in a bunch I won't deprive my kids of peanut butter, but I won't buy it willingly!    Oh, Oh, Oh, I had a really, really, good third period today!  You can ask if you want, but just know it was good.  Night  ~Kay

         Today, I started off mad because the mums made me go to 11 o'clock church instead of 6 o'clock mass, which meant I had to get up earlier!   But afterwards we went to Taco Bell because I had a craving.  However, it wasn't very good.  Then for the rest of the afternoon, I just did homework, bummed around the house and took a nap.  I didn't have any weird dreams during my nap.  Lately, I've been having the weirdest dreams and chances are you've been in one of them because it seems like everyone is.  But after I woke up I ate something (which I will rant about later) and watched the Osbournes.  I had a thought when I was drinking my water.  When I was younger I was in swimming lessons and I'm sure you were too.  Do you remember one of the first things they teach you is to blow bubbles in the water?  Now, why on Earth do they teach you to blow bubbles in the water?  I don't ever recall needing to use that.      Later has come.  This food thing.  When ever I'm at home, I eat all the time.  I eat when I'm hungry and when I'm not hungry, just because it's there and I can.  This is how people become fat.  I really need to watch which types of food I eat and make sure they are at least healthy.      This blog typing is distracting me from studying for vocabulary.  Not that I would actually be studying otherwise but note, this is my excuse.      I don't want to go to school tomorrow...I can't think of anyone that does...Their is snow on the ground and it's assnumbingly cold outside...There you have four good reasons why school should be called off!  God Bless, ~Kayla

      I'm updating here because I feel like it.  Yesterday at school seemed never ending, but thankfully I got through it.  Renae didn't come so I was afraid that she wasn't going to make it to the show either and we'd all have to cancel our plans. As it turned out Jessica and her dad made plans and Megan decided she didn't want to go.  So all that was left was Alisha and I.  But, when I got home their was a voicemail on my phone (YEA, I can get my voicemails now) from Renae saying that she was still able to go.  But, Alisha decided not to come and, like always, Renae and I were left alone.  Before the show, we went to Arby's, which looking back I don't think we should have because I ended up getting a stomach ache from it and we reeked of Arby's all night.  But, we got there right in the middle of the first bands performance.  Jason we there which surprised me but he hung out with us for awhile.  Jason is a nice guy, ya'll in bloggerland would like him.  But the next band that played was LAW and the lead singer was something to look at let me tell you!  As far as musical ability goes I didn't hear anything special about them though and probably wouldn't rush to see another LAW performance.   Or maybe I would, that boy in the white shirt was hot!  After they were done, my ears were ringing because we stood so close to the speakers and they are still ringing, over 12 hours later.  I liked Onesiphorous.  I'm so proud I finally can say their name correctly, they will no longer be known as THE O band.   After their set I talked to Kurt a bit, which was nice because I haven't talked to him in ages it seems.  Then the all glorious WITNESS played.  I was upset I had to leave mid-set and missed my favorite song "John Wayne on Acid," but what I did get to see was worth my money.  They are awesome!  Normally, it takes me ten minutes to drive home but last night it only took me 3! Can you say speeding?  And I was still 1 minute late for curfew.  Once I got home I went to bed cuz I was wiped.    I have to address something here.  Brad, I didn't lie about not going as you can see it all depended on whether or not Renae would be feeling up to it.  And I don't appreciate being called a liar!  I only saw you once the entire night and then, you weren't even looking at me so how could I say hi? Now I've had enough!   Good day all! ~kayla

      YEAHHHH!  I Finally got the link to work to my other blog!  I have no idea what I was doing wrong all the other times but it works now....although I'm not sure how many people read this because I noticed that Sean changed his link already on his blog to my other one so whatever, I like it better!  But I don't like how you have to be an xanga member to leave a message.  They said it was for security reasons but hey I just wanna hear from my friends!  That's it.  Just wanted to update you on the good news of the moment. ~kay

      Today was rather eventful.  I have so much homework!  Isn't it ironic how going on vacation can stress one out?  I basically have to finish the history book.  Review Session was canceled for history because Mrs. Liestra wasn't there, I was happy because I was home to see Hanson on TRL.  TRL used to be good when Carson hosted but now it's just a waste.  NHS was tonight.  That was fun to get semi-dressed up for.  Sean noticed my skirt which made me happy.  I'm tellin' ya'll it's the little things that matter.  I like it when guys wear ties.  I don't know why but I do.  We had to go pick up Tyler at Brian's house afterwards and had to stay and let Andy show us his magic tricks he learned.  Alex is talking so much lately.  But he still needs to work on Kayla.  I remember Andy used to call me Kiki for the longest time.    I leave tomorrow for Florida and I know that this will be difficult for some of you, *cough*Renae*cough* but I think you can handle it, but I want to know I was missed when I get back.  I want emails updating me on what's going on at school or life in general.  A lot can happen in 8 days.  Ben Folds will be coming so Renae have way more fun than you normally would because you have to have fun for me too.  Logan, I'll be back so don't get too comfortable.  Lexi, if you assign a staff member to a senior for senior profiles like they did last year make sure I get a good one and not a bitchy/ stuck up one.  Thanks!  Megan, remind Renae to get a spoon at lunch and not a fork.  Jessica...make sure everyone is well fed with animal crackers.  Email: KayJP13@aol.com  ~Kiki

      Oh wow I have soooo much to tell you!  On Thursday morning I had to go in early and take a physics test...that was kinda tough because I don't think I was prepared for it.  Then around 8 we boarded the bus and were off to the cities.  Four hours, one trip to Wendy's, and numerous games of Mafia later we were there.  The U of M campus is huge!  Since we arrived early, we broke off into groups and toured the campus on our own.  I've never wanted to be in college so bad!  College taught Renae time it was great!  "Kayla, 1 o'clock is really cute!"  One guy came up to Jessica and me and asked us to vote for this candidate that was running for class president.  I told him I couldn't vote b/c duh I don't go there, but Jess just took the flyer and told me I should have told him we didn't go to school there and he would have stopped bothering us sooner.  Oh well, live and learn.  The tour we had there was rather boring and the tour we had at their daily was rather boring too.  But I like the daily tour better than the other one.  Then we went to our hotel.  It turned out to be rather nice.  Renae, Alisha and I room together.  We made Renae sleep on the floor or she volunteered I'm not really sure anymore I just know Renae slept on the floor.  Heidi and Jen were bitching about having to go to the mall instead of a sit down restaurant and pouted the rest of the night after they didn't get their way.  Oh well!  After the mall we all sat in the hall and talked b/c of some retarded rule that says no girls in guys rooms and no guys in girls rooms.  But Logan was in our room...We couldn't let him be with Kaufman the entire time that is just cruel.  Mr. Powers came to us and told us to beware of the boys golf team from Fargo that was also staying on our floor because he didn't know them so he didn't trust them.  Later on in the night when Renae and I were sitting in the hall we met two of the boys.  The one was really cute but both were really nice.  Apparently, they were here for a tournament and they asked why we were there and we told them and we found out they were both juniors.  I don't know what Mr. Powers was worried about.  I loved it when Renae said "When being rebels don't tell teacher."  Because after that I think someone complained about us because we were sent to our rooms and told to go to bed at 10:30.  Which I will say we were more then pissed about because the sheet clearly says in black in white lights out at 11 o'clock.  Their was some more drama that went on but I'll refrain from writing about it in here.  The next morning we were up at 6:30 and down to breakfast at by 7.  I was sick again but what else is new.  When we were bring all our things down to load the bus we met the cute golf boy at the elevator and he told us to have fun on our tour so I told him good luck with his golf.  Now you may ask why I refer to him as golf boy and not his name...I do not know his name.  You see Renae and I forgot to ask.  Moving on, the WCCO tour was interesting when we saw the set but other than that my feet hurt from standing for so long.  I did like the mini tour we took of downtown before hand.  Then we drove some 20 miles to a Taco Bell because Miss Heidi wanted Taco Bell.  I was still sick and didn't want to look at food.  I ate though and felt better.  Funny how that is.  The Star Tribune tour was a waste because I didn't really care how they made the paper.  I do know however that that building is a direct result of why the rainforest is disappearing.  Their were rolls of paper that weighted 2000 lb.  Filling a warehouse.  Finally, we were done and on our way back home.  I think at one point everyone on the bus was asleep.  But weird lady chaperone that came with us was so loud and never shut up the entire ride home.   She ended up waking all of us up with her voice.  We all agreed it was Mr. Powers punishment because she was talking to him.  I went to bed last night at 8:30 and woke up this morning at 7 for my AE interview.  That was crap.  It was a group interview.  Yeah I know.  I know I didn't get it I can just kinda feel it.  So the job hunt continues.    3 more days!

      Happy Easter!  I can honestly say today was the first time I've ever seen a line to get into church.  It amazes me the amount of people that only go on Christmas and Easter.  My parents make sure we're there every Sunday.  I like that, and I'll do the same for my children someday.  The Church is a very important place that children need to be and learn from.  Allen was there...he was dressed very metro but cute nonetheless.  Something that baffles me about Catholics is that we only dress up on Christmas and Easter.  Some girls weren't dressed very appropriate I thought.  Skirts from Hollister and Abercrombie are not meant for church, if you know what I mean.  Another thing as long as I'm talking about things that bother me during church, is the parents that don't take their kids out when they start to cry.  It is so difficult to hear Father when their is a kid in front of you balling their eyes out.    Today ends this Lenten season and I am proud to say I made it through without one chocolate chip cookie.  I had one today, but it didn't taste as good as I thought it would.  I'm thinkin' lent solved my cookie addiction, so lent was a success in my mind.  And I must say that I am very proud of Renae for choosing to do Lent with me even though she isn't Catholic and getting through it without having Ramen noodles.  It means alot that she encouraged me by doing Lent with me.  The one thing that bothers me so much is when people that aren't catholic and some that are say they are going to have a big juicy steak on a Friday or say their going to eat something that I gave up.  It doesn't make me jealous at all it just makes me think that person is rude, inconsiderate, and immature.  So if you were one of those people learn from your mistake of this year and don't repeat it next year.    I hope the Easter Bunny visited your house and gave you something you wanted and not a rotten egg...Happy Easter  9 more days!  ~Kay

      Graduations is nearing...ooo exciting times.  I have a cousin on both sides graduating so Memorial Day Weekend is going to be a non stop party.   Well, atleast for the Weber side of the family.  The Persons' aren't huge partiers.  They're more reserved.  Now, my mom's side whoa they know how to party and hard.  Alcohol is always around.  But not only am I underage but I'm also straight edge so I wouldn't do that anyway.  I don't think I have to quote Minor Threat.   I don't see why someone would drink or do drugs when they know the consequences.  That's just not me.  But I still like to have a good time and my mom's side is really good at providing a good time.  I'm a strange mix of the two can't you see.  Sometimes I feel like I don't fit in with either side.  It doesn't really help that I'm in the middle on both sides either.  I think I'm destined to be in the middle all the time.  I mean I'm the middle grandchild on both sides and the middle child in my family.    Ashley's reception is on Saturday, I believe and I don't know when Kate's is.  I like the reception the best because you get to see how they decorate the garage normally with all the things they've done in school.  The things from when they were really small like in elementary school is the best because it is always so cute.  Watertown's graduation is the same weekend so it will be interesting to see how certain family members juggle that.    I realize I'm rabbling about graduation but I have nothing else to talk about because I didn't do anything the past few days that have been worth typing about.  Honest.   Well now you've learned that Kayla is straight edge but I'm sure if you know me you've figured that out.

      ...This morning would have been so good just to skip!  I mean really I didn't do anything that I couldn't have made up in study hall in my morning classes!  Just two more hours that all I wanted!  But NOOO....I had to LEARN!  I'm not going to waste space with an overview of my day because it was really boring.    I had AP review session tonight, surprisingly it went by faster then class normally does.  So that was good.  Came home to homework so yeah...that's a wonderful cycle of school, homework, sleep, school, homework, sleep....   ID badges and why mine gives me panic attacks:  I think I'm one of the few students who has never forgotten their ID badge and has never been privileged enough to wear the cool neon green sticker for a day.  But because of a faulty clip at the beginning of the year which would always unfasten and let my ID fall to the ground whenever it darn well pleased, I'm plagued with constantly checking to see if my ID is at my hip.  Several instances have brought this up.  During a recent outing to the mall, on a Saturday, I glanced down and noticed my ID wasn't there.  Well, duh, it's a Saturday it's not supposed to be.  But for about a half of a second my heart skipped a beat while I had a brief panic attack about where my ID was at.  Don't worry I quickly recovered and remembered it was Saturday and laughed at myself.  But the best is yet to come.  I went to go throw my tray away, in one of the garbage cans in the hall because I don't eat in the cafeteria.  Normally, on my way back to the room from getting my food, I place my ID on my tray because my hands are full and I can't hook it back on right away.  After I through my tray away, I noticed I didn't have my ID on.  I froze dead in my tracks staring at the garbage can  This is where I had another panic attack after I realized what I had done.  OMG!  I just through my ID away!  I wasn't about to go digging through the garbage can to look for it.  Do you know what's in the garbage?  Neither do I.  Once I started breathing again I thought maybe, just maybe I took it off the tray today.  This was a very slight possibility but it was worth a shot.  I literally, walked briskly back into the room.  I wasn't going to run are you kidding me there were people in the hall and I didn't want to look like an even bigger dork.  I mean come on I was staring at the garbage can forever half expecting it to say "woops you need this" and spit it back at me.  But as soon as the door closed behind me I ran to my desk and thank God laying face down was my beautiful ID!  This is just two cases of why my ID has caused me much anxiety.  I understand why the school board is making us wear them but mine is causing me more stress then I think it's worth.    Thank you for reading....leave a message or else......the ID will get you! ~Kay

      Today was kinda a filler...it was a TUESDAY!  We took a test in Algebra which I think went well.  Then in Lit and Comp we took an AP practice test...wow that was humbling.  The test in History was okay until I started the essay.  I babbled for four pages and know she'll give it back to me saying I didn't "anaylze the topic enough."  Lunch was good becuase "mean lunch lady" gave me alot of fries today!  wOOt (  My mom and I went to Best Buy tonight.   I was asked how I was six times sometimes twice by the same guy.  I didn't have a problem with telling them I was fine because they were cute.  Kudos to Best Buy for hot CD sellers.  So yeah, got some CDs and dropped a bunch of money ( "dropped" I have know idea what I was thinking when I used that word)  I forgot to say yesterday that Anna and Michelle made cheerleading so YEA!  for them.  They were so happy it was hard not to smile right along with them.    I'm lovin' the nice weather.  My car doesn't love the warm weather but I do so blah to the car.    Until tomorrow... ~Kay

      I went to bed early last night and didn't update (sorry Lexi).  Last night at church I came to a realization.  When ever I get into the nave, a sense a calmness and security comes over me.  It's a good feeling.  Father Joe tried to inspire us to give up more evils in our lives and spend more quiet time with God for this Holy Week.  I told myself that I would listen to music less such as in the car and in the morning when I'm getting ready.  But so far that hasn't worked out too well.    Today was good.  In Algebra the smelly kids made fun of me.  First they made fun of Ryan for liking rock music like Godsmack and not rap.  So I stood up for him b/c I don't like rap.  The larger smelly one said "I can't believe this quiet girl likes rock music she probably rocks out to it in her room"  (rolling my eyes)  Brett Kollars and I got to talking about music some how I don't remember how but he said he liked Ben Folds so I asked if he was going to see him.  He said he couldn't for some reason but his gf was going.  I wish I could go...oh wait I am going (I'm sneaking in...lol)  Lit and comp was vocabish.  History was hellish.  Lunch was foodish.  In chem we boiled pop.  In physics we watched a movie.  We were slow in Newspaper today because the computers were being dumb.    After school I had to pick up Ty and bring him home.  I got a call from American Eagle and I have an interview on Saturday the 17th at 9 o'clock.  So cross your fingers b/c I need a job.    Later Gater

      As soon as my mom came in this morning to tell me to get up I faced my biggest struggle of the day.  It took me forever to roll out of bed and get in the mood to start getting ready for my day.  Algebra was yucky as was Lit and Comp.  During reading period I spaced out.  I was reading the edge and it brought back the memory of Kurt asking me if I was going to throw it down.  If you could have seen my thought bubble this is what it would have said, "...throwing it down, aka moshing aka a bunch of sweaty boys bouncing around and hitting each other.  Moshing does look fun but I think I'll stay a spectator because as Kurt said, he could never see me hitting somebody just for the fun of it."...end of thought (the bell rang)  Lunch was okay, weird red headed/chubby lunch lady gave me food today so I was happy.  Chem was dumb cuz we didn't do anything and in Physics we went to the computer lab.  I asked Shea if he would come in after school to take his picture again (they got deleted again...I know! (very angry face!))  He said he would and then some how it became a classroom discussion about same sex marriages.  Newspaper was productive today.  I got most of the pics in (the ones we had to retake) but I still have to go in tomorrow which I'm not happy about but at least I don't have to go in as early anymore.  Now as I review my day in my head I must have sounded really bitchy to Kurt, complaining about newspaper.  But it's just that I was so frustrated and annoyed with people being so inconsiderate.  So, if I was bitchy today, I'm sorry, I'm normally not that way, I guess everything just got to me.   I didn't do anything tonight b/c my parents think I'm always gone so I stayed home...not that I had plans anyway.  I think I'm supposed to do something with Megan tomorrow but I'm not sure because she said something on Monday and hasn't mentioned it since so I'm sorta out of the loop I guess.    ~Kay

      I haven't updated in a few days I see.  I haven't really been online since Thursday though so that might have something to do with it.    On Friday, I went to Lexi's open house and that was about it for that day.  Saturday was crazy! (hence then title) We had a bunch of people at our house over the weekend for my aunt's birthday party.  Saturday didn't really go how I planned it though.  I went to my cousin Ashley's open house earlier than my parents did so I could leave earlier.  I left for Liz's open house and I felt kinda bad cuz their wasn't alot of people at her's and I only stayed for about 15 minutes cuz I felt uncomfortable.  Then I came home and no sooner did I sit my tushy on the couch did Renae call me and soon we were off to more open houses.  After a quick stop at B&G to consult the map.  Alisha, Renae, and I were off on the search of Joe's house.  We found it and said hi and gave him his cards but left so we could make it to Logan's.  After Logan's open house we all went to our respectable homes.  Renae picked me up so we could go see the Spill Canvas show, but Alisha's mom wouldn't let her go on account of the Tornado warnings.  We were early so we sat in the parking ramp until we heard the sirens go off and then decided it would be better to be inside.  It scared the shit out of me when the drunk Indian was at the crosswalk bothering some people.  He HIT ME!  ASSHOLE DRUNK!  But the nice man that was there protected us.  We ended up sitting in the hall for an hour until the weather cleared up.  DAMN TORNADOES!  I'm not gonna say what I thought of the first three bands b/c they did not please me.  Finally, what I waited all day for, The Spill Canvas played!  I'm gonna miss 'em.  Joe was nutz on drums.  They played some new songs.  Afterwards, Renae and I had planned to go see Soulcreate too at Black Sheep.  So we get to the door and see that it's down pour rain outside.  Renae being smart says, "we're runnin'!" So we go.  I take two steps and my shoe falls off. I scream, "My shoe!"  Renae keeps runnin' and I go back for my shoe. I took the other one off and ran for it.  We were soaked and were laughing so hard when we got to the parking ramp we couldn't even stand up.  After hydroplaning it down 41st street we went to our homes.    Sunday was a good day.  Graduation was great.  Kate's speech was wonderful.  She sounded so confident up there.  I could have never done that.  I had fun at Kate's open house.  The bandos still freak me out and I think they always will.  Mrs. Newitt was there.  Yeah, that's right Renae, the devil was there.  lol.  Church was wonderful.  I love Alan's voice though, so as long as he's singing it is a good mass.    Monday...not much to report on.  Everyone went home and my house is now mine again!   Love ya, ~Kayla

      Yesterday was the last day of school.  After our presentations in apush, Mrs. Leistra said something to my class that I'll never forget.  She said, "Choose a career that you want and one that will make you happy.  Don't choose something just to make money, because if you do it that way, you'll never be happy."  No one has ever told me that before, especially not a teacher, but it stuck with me and kept playing over and over again in my head on the way home.  I know I've called Mrs. Leistra a homework nazi before but that advice meant a lot, I think it was because no one has ever told me that before.    I read through Lizzie's blog this afternoon and the ten things she has listed on it are so enlightening.  I only wish I could have written it.  Check it out: http://www.dibbledaduck.blogspot.com/  Graduation Good-bye: (to the people that I think read this)  Brad: You're right, we've had our ups and downs through the last two years, but I'm really glad that we're leaving each other on good terms.  Overall, it's been good.  You were there for me last year when my grandfather died when a lot of my friends didn't know how to be.  So for that, I'm eternally grateful.  The college that you're going to sounds like it's a nice one.  You may be three states over but I'm positive the internet still works there so make sure to still instant message me.  I want to stay caught up.    Lexi: or is it Lexi LeVanArkel? What do I say to my editor-in-chief?  I always did take you more seriously than Chris.  You're a very intelligent hardworking person and I know that you want to be a news anchor and I have no doubt that you can do it.  It's too bad that you aren't able to do the TV stuff with us next year.  Don't worry, Brianna and I talked about it after history on Wed. and we decided next year we are going to make the paper the best.  Be sure to visit!  Logan:  You have a way of making things more fun.  I have to thank you for never giving me attitude like Mollie and Bri did.  Even though their was some sorta plot to kill me....I'm gonna miss you next year.  You're also an intelligent hardworking person so whatever you decide to do I'm sure you'll be very good at it.  You also be sure to visit!  Joe: It was really nice to get to know you year. This is particularly relevant to Mrs. Leistra's advice. You've showed me that it's okay not to go to college and it's okay to follow a dream. I do like The Spill Canvas and I truly do want you guys to succeed. Kick ass at CBGB!  Be nice to the teeny boppers lol!  God Bless, Kayla

      This morning I felt like shit. Funny I still ended up in school to finish off the year.  My chemistry test went alot better than I thought it would and in physics I thought the test was not easy but not too hard either.  The pizza was good in Newspaper...came home at noon thirty.  When I got home I didn't feel like doing anything. However I did end up going through and cleaning some things out.  I ripped up over a years worth of painful memories that were just collecting bad karma.  It was extremely liberating.  In addition to the memories, I ripped up a bunch of notes and through away worksheets that had piled up in my notebooks.  I can't wait until they all go to the dump where they belong! That paragraph sounds extremely bitchy...forgive me.   I'm still not feeling well.  I have a headache.  Damn you headache!  Peace out my homies   P.S. Renae he is soooo hopable!: http://www.lifestylerock.com/mason.jpg http://www.lifestylerock.com/masonsings.jpg

      Anonymous has been identified as Elizabeth.  That case can now rest.  We had spaghetti tonight.  Italian people must have stomachs made out of iron because that stuff can really mess with ones stomach.    Today, kinda sucked.  I got two more graduation open house invites today from Lexi and Liz, that didn't suck tho, it just means my Saturday is more busy.  Thank you Lexi for having your's on Friday!  Algebra was dumb because all we did was review and in Lit and Comp we did some grammar review for "fun" which just made me feel stupid because I couldn't remember any of it.  In History Anna and I presented our project so I am officially done with Hell.  All I have to do is show up on Wednesday.  Lunch was mass chaos for food.  I seriously had to push people just to get to the beverage container.  During Chem we reviewed and we did the same in Physics.  During Newspaper we did nothing productive which has been our routine since we stopped printing on Friday...well Thursday for me.  The Nationalist comes out tomorrow so that will be good.    I'm not ready for finals.  I'm not ready to be a senior.  I'm not ready to loose some people.  I'm not ready...but it's happening.    Good Luck tomorrow! ~Kayla

      It seems as though anonymous doesn't want to fess up to their identity because I still haven't found out who they are yet.  Today was extremely boring.  I woke up, showered, started my lit and comp paper, finished history, and chemistry and studied a bit for Algebra and physics.  I have a 'C' in Chemistry and I blame Florida because I desperately want to blame someone other than myself.  In all my other classes I seemed to bounce back fairly well, but for some reason I just can't seem to get it in Chem.  I know their will be some people reading this going, "A 'C' is still really good."  But I've never gotten a 'C' in high school before and I don't want to start my last semester of my junior year.  I've worked too hard to just punk out now.  But then again what does it matter?  I mean 10 years from now is it really going to make a difference if I got a 'B' in high school chemistry or a 'C'?  Hell no.  But it matters to me now, so I really have to do well on this final.  That was two contradicting sentences so you don't need to point it out to me.  It's Sunday, so therefore it's my weekly church review.  Thank God Father Joe did the mass tonight.  It was a good mass.  When we were leaving I saw Lance and just froze.  I successfully avoided him.  I don't know what it is about that man but whenever he's around I just get extremely uncomfortable.  Since he quit to persue his "musical career," I've stopped being involved at church.  Youth Council lost what little direction it had and all the activities that had been previously planned quit.  I still go to church every Sunday though, but I'll admit to feeling judged by Jolene.  I think she thinks she's some how more worthy of God because she is more involved at church still.  She'd make the perfect nun. LOL.  Joel wasn't there tonight again.  However I did see him at the mall yesterday on my outing with my mother.  I saw him working when I walked by the Buckle.  Whenever I see him, I freeze too, but in a good way.  After he graduated two years ago, I sorta just forgot about him because we were at such different points in our lives.  I mean the boy has been to Iraq and back.  But ever since I saw him that day when I was with Renae, I want to see him again.  I've decided it's not like the weird "I have a crush on him and he's so cute" thing, it's more like, "I just want to sit down and talk to him and see where he's been and where he's going" thing.  That probably makes no sense to anybody except me.  Nod if that last sentence is correct.  lol   Goodnight

      Last night I had the wierdest dream.  I dreamt that I decided to go to U of M in the Twin Cities and my family and I went on a campus visit, but my parents decided that they weren't going to let me go because the campus was too big.  But the campus in my dream didn't look like the campus that newspaper visited in April.  What could this dream mean?    This morning was rather boring.  I did some Algebra homework.  Around noon I think it was I went to Brad's open house.  Then I came home and helped my mommy clean.  I've discovered my mom's hidden plot to trick me into going to Wal-mart.  She has this way of telling me we're going one place and somehow we end up at Wal-mart.  Take today for example, she said we were going to the mall so I was all for that but then somehow after the mall we mysteriously needed to go to Wal-Mart too.  This wouldn't matter all that much except I don't like going to Wal-mart.  And last time this happened I needed a notebook and she said she didn't know what kind I wanted so I would have to go along if I wanted it.  What is so hard about picking up a notebook?  Today, I found a song that describes how I felt about someone seven months ago.  It's by Slick Shoes and it's their song "Regrets."  You have to switch the girl to a guy but it totally fits to where I was at then.  I really wish I would have found this song earlier.  The last line of the song is "I know I'll always love you. I wish that you felt the same."  Atleast I know Renae still has faith because if you loose faith then you lose the magic of what was.  Or whatever philosophical shit she through at me that night.  Which in fact was quite enlightening.    signing off, ~Kaylala

      I went to school today, unlike yesterday.  I didn't feel up to school yesterday so opt to stay home instead.  But I thought I had anynomous tagged as Megan but turns out it's not Megan.  As you can tell that's really bothering me so whoever it is please tell me!    In Algebra I had the hardest time trying to convince one of the smelly kids I was a junior and that being a junior I would graduate in 2005 but he didn't believe the shirt I was wearing that said "junior girls-2005" on it and thought I was a sophomore.  Once I had him convinced I was in fact a junior he was determined to think I graduated in 2006.  Do you see what I put up with?  In Lit and Comp we watched a movie...well they did, I did Algebra homework.  In Hell today some kids presented thier projects...nap time.  Anna and I finished our project in lunch, which should be more entertaining than the kids that went today.  In Chem we reviewed and in Physics she reviewed with us except I did my Chem homework.  Then in Newspaper I did...nada.    Tonight, I went to Lewis to buy graduation cards because yes...I put it off.  Logan proved to be hardest to buy for.  But I was satisfied with my purchases.  Then I met Lizzie at Century where we went to see Mean Girls.  That was a nice movie.  A bit unrealistic but nice nonetheless.  Then we went to Coldstone.  After waiting 30 minutes in line we finally got our ice cream.  Lexi waited on me.  Hi, Lexi!  Loved the ice cream, although I still couldn't finish the like it.  Lizzie and I saw Mrs. Leistra there.  It is weird to see your teacher outside of school.  I guess one just half expects them to live there.  Can't you just seem them rolling out a cot from the closet and cuddling up to their corrected tests?  haha, that's a funny thought.    It's raining outside.  I like it when it's raining and I'm laying in bed and I can hear it.  I like the sound, it's just soothing.    Night ~Kayla

      Ever since I came back from Florida, I've been going at 100 mph to catch up and keep up in my classes but today it feels like I finally hit the wall.  I'm so drained physically and emotionally.  I came home from school today and just slept for like three hours.  It doesn't feel like the end of the year either.  Maybe it's the weather.  But, we only have five days left of school.  I've become stressed over finals since the review sheets are starting to be handed out and I realize I don't remember this stuff.  Luckily, I only have three this semester, since I won't have any tests in my AP classes and I don't think Mr. Powers will make some grandiose test.  I'm ready to be done with homework and tests but I'm not ready to say good-bye to some people.  I thought I was ready but as graduation becomes closer I realize that I don't want to say good-bye.  Realize this is only like three people and as far as the others are concerned if I had my way they'd have their diplomas now and I'd never have to see them again.  Oh, fun story.  I shouldn't have been allowed to drive today on account of I was out of it pretty bad.  But on the way to pick up Megan this morning I totally went through a red light.  It's not like I could have prevented it or anything because I was turning and it turned when I was waiting for traffic to clear so I had to go.  I'm just hoping the nice camera at the top will forgive me.    Some one, please, come peel me off of the wall, I'm lonely!

      I couldn't decide which one to post on.  I really need input from you guys, tell me which one is better!    Today was...okay.  I had a test in Algebra, I know I got atleast 4 wrong because what I got didn't look like the answers I got on the review sheet.  Then in Lit and Comp we presented.  I was happy on account of I wore my black pants just for that.  Oh, and Sean, note that I saw you tap Ashley and make ticking noises like a clock.  I know our presentation ran long but that was because of the questions and everyones imput.  The noise was uncalled for.  Although all the compliments on my hair made up for it. ;-) Next, we kept watching Good Morning Vietnam in History.  Reviewed in Chem and in Physics.  Then in Newspaper, I sorta did a bunch of little things.  Chris  and I were talking and he told me that I should be editor in chief next year and he has or is going to tell Powers that.  I sorta laughed it off, he then he said he was serious.  And I believe him too because he's said this to me before during one of our Saturday morning meetings.  I'm not sure how to react to this.  I mean if Powers, Lexi and Chris decided that they would want me then by all means I would be honored to do it and I would do my best and work super hard.  But, if Powers doesn't want that to go to me and he thinks someone else is more deserving, I'm not going to be upset about it, I'll still work just as hard as I would otherwise.  Plus, Renae and I already have the entertainment section for next year and that is the part of the paper that we've talked about forever.  So if Chris really does push for me to be Chief then it would be like icing on the cake.  I'm gonna stop talking about it because the chances of this happening are slim to none so anyways...did you see nights Gilmore Girls.  Rory and Dean should be back together and Dean should divorce his wife because come on, who gets married at 18?  Comment...and Sweet Dreams ~Kay

      Their are some songs that bother me for several reasons:  1. Anything by Britney Spears...enough said 2. "My Band"-Eminem This song, like every other song Eminem has rapped on, has gotten annoying real fast.  It was good the first three times I heard it and now can be recycled.   3. "I want it that way"-The Backstreet Boys  I'll admit I went through the teeny-bopper stage and really liked them, not as much as NSYNC but I liked them.   But one thing I never understood was that song.  What way does he want it?  Obviously, that way, but what way is that? 4. “Intuition”-Jewel  That song ruined her career 5.“Where is the Love?”-Black Eyed Peas  It's a good song with a good message but I think they’d find the love if they stop playing that song constantly on the radio and making people angry when they’re on their way to school! 6. Anything by Outkast after it's fifth play 7. Watching Jessica Simpson sing anything is enough to make you hate her dispite the fact that she doesn't know the difference between a buffalo and a chicken wing.

      This is what you meant by the new blogger format, Lizzie!  It is really cool.  Except I don't remember how to make my links customized *hint Sean*    Nothing really worth anything happened today.  I felt really bad for Renae b/c she lost her ID and couldn't eat lunch even tho I offered to buy her lunch.  My Mommy felt bad for you, too, Renae.  Just another reason why IDs are stupid.    I swear boy/girl/it is haunting me!  Ever since I saw this girl in the girls bathroom that I always thought was a boy, I see her everywhere.  Maybe she knows and is punishing me for being so cruel.  But I feel extremely bad about this already, you have no idea.    This freshmen in my Chem class that sits in the row behind me always flirts with the boy sitting next to her.  I can hear her and you can tell the boy isn't having too much of it but goes along just to be nice.  It is the cutest thing.    "Ryan that sits next to me in Algebra" always talks to me about cars.  I know nothing about cars and stare blankly at him, but do you think he'd understand...no.  I don't know what is under the hood, all I know is that you need all of it to make the car go.  I don't car if the car is turbo charged.  I don't care if a car has flames coming out of the exhaust pipe.  I don't car what the proper name for the type of car is.  I don't car what kind of "system" a car has.  I'm not interested in those things but he doesn't get the hint and just keeps going off about cars.    Tell me what you think of the new template...

      Wow, you're gone for a week and you miss so much!  Renae's dream is coming true even though she refuses to believe it and passes it off as just some mean joke.  Alisha and I both think it's true because hello!  it is  Theirs a convicted rapest roaming the halls of RHS.  I really don't know what to think of this for two reasons.  It is gross and so wrong and I feel so bad for the little girl and he deserves to be punished for what he did.  But on the other hand I know him and know he's not a bad person.  In fact he's one of the last people at RHS that I think would do this.  I feel bad for him because of how the media is handling it.  They make him sound like a mad man when that isn't the case.  I was so bewildered by it all when Jessica revealed the name to me.  The pieces just don't fit.    I have a pile of homework sitting next to me on the floor.  I find it easier to look at it then actually do it.  Right now my main thing is finding a job for the summer which is proven to be more difficult than I first thought.  Damn you American Eagle!  Renae told me Ross is quitting his job as a shoe salesmen to become a lifeguard over the summer...Maybe I can have his job.  I mean I have loads of shoes, if I can buy them I think I could easily sell them.    Oh, I heard this wonderful band called Armor for Sleep they are good...You need to listen to them!    A few moments ago it hailed outside which is funny because I could see the sun coming through the clouds.    Oh, if anyone else was concerned, I got out of my previous engagement for the 29th so I'm free to go to the Lyndsay Diaries/The Spill Canvas show.  Which I am extremely excited for!  28 more days!  I really wish Time and Distance would stop in Sioux Falls.  They have their unfinished tour schedule posted on their web site and in late July their in St. Louis and than like four days later their stopping in Aberdeen.  So I think, as the rest of you should, they should stop in Sioux Falls because it's on the way.  And what the hell is in Aberdeen anyway?  Renae is super excited because Recover is coming.  Plus, she told me that Gage told her that Rookie is coming back on June 22!  OH, that will be great!  RENAE WE GET TO SEE HOPPY AGAIN!  I wish blogger had insterted smiley faces like xanga does because they would be all over this paragraph!  I'm off to do another from of procrastination...Watching TV! ~Kay

      It's been a few days without an update from me.  How could I deprive you?  Monday, I had an eye appointment and surprise surprise, my eyes have gotten worse.  Then I babysat for Rachael and Jason.  Oh good news!  I got a job.  Well, not really, but the first week of August I'm babysitting Rachael and Jason for the week.  So I guess that's a somewhat job.  On Tuesday, my family and I rode the bike trails for about 10 miles and boy is my ass sore today.  But today, oh today was filled with interesting things.    Renae called my cell and for whatever reason I had to call her back.  I did but from my house phone and then she had to hang up so she called me back at my house.  Well my mom turns around and yells at me for tying up the phone lines.  But in the same sentence she yells at me for using my cell phone too much.  Then my dad, tonight, catches me talking on my cell for what he calls, "shooting the shit," and yells at me.  So either I cut back my cell phone usage or it's out.  But then I ask what am I left with?  Can't talk on the cell for too long, can't talk on the house phone too long, and can't go on the internet during the day.  Am I supposed to resort to smoke signals?  I can't help I'm a very social person!  I can solve my parents problem very easily if they'd only see it my way.  Get cable internet and get a plan that has more minutes.  There problem solved!  Wow, you're a smart one Kayla!  Thank you, I do try!  Okay, moving on to tonight.  Well first I ran errands with Renae and then went shopping with Logan this afternoon for Alisha's birthday present.  My family and I went to Bagel boy...cuz it's my new obsession.  Renae picked me up in her new kick ass honda civic at around 7, picked up Megan and then mozied.  Yelled, HI to Mr. Denovan and yeah...Hung out at Alisha's a bit and then went to Thunder Road.  The Go-Karts were fun but I have not intention of doing them in the near future.  Then we rock climbed on this wall.  I will never do that again but I did get to the top twice and can now say I did it.  Renae, Megan, Logan, and I got bored so we went to Wal-Mart and picked up some cheap fireworks.  We were racing time at this point b/c of stupid ass curfew.  It was 10:30 at this point.  Only to have Alisha call and oops, Renae had Alisha's keys, so we raced back to thunder road a good 15 minutes away give or take stoplights and speeding.  Got there, gave 'em the keys and raced back to Alisha's to get our pyro on!  Now, 10:45.  I called my dad, on the same cell phone I am to cut back from and smoothly said we were watching a movie and that it would be over in a half hour so I'd be late coming home.  My dad believed me only when I said Logan would take me home b/c he's 18 and the city doesn't enforce the curfew on him. So we lit a bunch of smoke bombs in the street and lit some sparkelers.  Both of which are illegal in city limits but no one really pays attention so who cares?  Tonight was fun...I hope Logan found his way out of my neighborhood....  Love ya, Kayla

      I'm not normal.  I'm sure you already knew that though.  I'm so particular about my pants that I find myself "back to school" shopping months ahead of everyone else.  A pair of pants has to go through several rigorous test.    1. They have to fit well around the waist.  I have to wear a belt most of the time though.   2. They have to have a good length.  They can't be too long because I'm not that tall.  But then they can't be too short so when I sit you can see my socks either.  3. This is the one most pants fail.  They must pass the shoe test.  I can not stand it when pants bunch up around my shoes!  I know this can be altered with a little snip and I usually end up doing this to most of my pants.   4. As vain as it may sound, they have to fit good in the tushy. If your pants are baggy in the butt it makes your butt appear flabby.  That's just gross.    shirts...easy enough.  Pants...a pain in the ass.    okay, so the thing that sparked that was my shopping adventure to Hollister yesterday.  I bought a pair of tan pants that are really cute, but I think they'll end up getting cut.  I also bought a pair of blue jeans that are going back.  Once I brought them home I realized they didn't pass two of the above tests.    Last night was my nephew Alex's second birthday party.  I have the cutest nephews ever and I'm up to argue that.  I kept my hair straight for the party and everyone said such nice things.  (Don't worry all, it's back to curly now) My uncle told me the only reason my dad doesn't like it is because I look more mature.  I can handle looking more mature.  Then we somehow got into the piercing thing.  I want to get my ear pierced up on the top and I want to get my belly button pierced.  My uncle asked me if I was in my rebellious stage.  Why is piercing considered rebellious?  This post has been brought to you by boredom. ~Kay  So I thought I'd just edit and add to this one.  Tonight Tyler, my dad and I went to church.  Mommy's really ill with the flu that has been going around our house.  It is only a matter of time for me I'm afraid.  I have the worst immune system!  This Sunday was more rewarding than the last.  I was once again reassured that God loved me!  It was Father Joe's last mass in our parish.  I'm gonna miss that guy.  He did a lot for St. Michaels.  I pray that God is with him as he trys to do the same for the new parish.  Alan didn't really sing as much tonight but let the girls in Morning Star take over the task.  This did not please me!  Alan is pretty and has such a pretty voice.  Joel was there tonight too.  I don't know what it is about Joel but everytime I see him my heart skips a beat.  I don't know how to explain it other than to say that I get really nervous when I see him but then I'm really happy that he's there too.  If only he was three years younger...or I three years older.  Hot boy from confirmation was there too.  Too bad he's going to the new parish and goes to O'G.  Damn, that boy made confirmation a lot more enjoyable.  Or atleast gave me something to look at to pass the time.  After church we went to Calvers.  I don't recommend the chicken tenders...they weren't very good.  Then Brad came over and we exchanged cds.  I definitely put in Sugarcult as soon as you left and loved it.  My cousin Courtney called today and said she's going to have a baby.  I think it's funny my uncle Terry's gonna be a grandpa. I have something else I want to talk about but I think it is too soon.  So I'll wait till a later day.   ~alyak

      Today was a busy day for me.  This afternoon Erica and I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11.  Contrary to the news reports it is playing at Century.  The documentary was extremely powerful and moving.  I hated Bush going into this film and hate him even more now that I've seen it.  I cannot put into words how much I don't like him.  I'm proud to say our own Senator makes an appearance in the movie a few times.  This one particular woman was in the film that talked about her son that died in the war and she was crying while reading his last letter home.  I couldn't help but cry with her.  I don't care if your Republican, democrats, or just don't give a rat's ass about politics you truly need to see this film.  It's our world and you need to know what's going on.  Their are a lot of people that don't agree with the film and think it's all a bunch of political propaganda but it is really hard to argue images.  I guess you could twist facts and statements but you cannot argue those images.  They are too powerful.  At the end of the film the entire theater clapped and cheered.  I've never been in a theater that did that before.  That's how big of a statement it made.  After the movie Erica brought me home and I just sat around until about 5:15 then I left for the mall to meet Logan.  Once there we met up with Alisha and Renae.  From there we went to the skate park to see this show.  This show sucked.  I'm not gonna lie, I've been to worse but this one was pretty bad.  The first band was horrible.  The second band was okay, but I was too busy eating my Subway to really pay attention.  By the way, my stomach isn't feeling too well, I blame Subway.  The Spill Canvas was last...of course.  They never disappoint.  Erica had to leave before they started so it sucked that she had to witness the horrible bands.    I'll be honest, I woke up this morning with every intention of not going to this show.  I knew this one person was gonna be there and to be completely honest, I didn't want to see them.  I didn't know how I'd react or even what I'd say.  But I'm glad I went because I made myself confront something that I needed to.  The confrontation wasn't anything.  It was just me seeing them and not feeling anything.  I didn't talk to them, but I didn't need to.  Just seeing them again was enough.  I'm gonna be okay.    When I brought Logan back to his car we saw Sean in the parking lot.  So Sean, what did you do to get the mall security on your ass?  Just curious...

      WOW! I haven't updated in awhile.  I really haven't had much to say or update the world on.  However, I have some things on my mind tonight.    Yesterday, I was joyfully skipping down the stairs (sarcastic, really) when all of a sudden I missed the second and most crucial one and fell down the remaining five steps.  My brother looked at me and then when he realized what I had did, he burst out laughing.  Not an "are you okay Kayla?" Nope, just hysteric laughter from my brother.  Granted, I was laughing too, because come on, I fell down the stairs.    Today I went to the mall before my Orthodontist appointment to buy this belt I've been tracking ever since it first made an appearance on ae.com.  I used Megan's gift certificate to buy the cutest belt that has a butterfly as a buckle.  It is finally mine!  After months of drooling from the window I finally own it!  Thank you Megan for helping a fantasy become a reality.  Very dramatic I know but go with it.    So after I killed enough time at the mall I went to my appointment.  I sat in the waiting for about a half hour and was royally pissed off about that.  But they cemented this wire behind my upper teeth today.  Dude, it feels so weird!  I have so much metal in my mouth I think I can start getting radio signals anytime.    So Renae asked if I'd hang out with her tonight, right.  But right when I was walking in the door she calls and says she can't hang out with me tonight.  Dudette, you asked me to hang out and then bailed on me.  What the fuck?  Mi familia and I went to Bagel Boy for supper.  My new favorite place to eat in the big S.F. I walked in and was very surprised to see Autumn Knutson working there.  She smiled when she saw me and got very excited.  Now Autumn is one of those typical popular, friends with everyone, cheerleader types.  But what sets her apart from all of her bitchy friends is the fact that she isn't a bitch.  She is honestly one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  She always says hi even when shes with all of her friends and always has something nice to say.  I've known her since elementary school and can't say this about a lot of people I've known that long but I can honestly say she is a genuinely good person.  I'm sitting here...and I have nothing profound to say.  I have a confession, however...I'm not so sure about this one but I'm gonna say it anyway to the only person that will understand.  Renae, I think I like him too.  I don't want to fuck the whole friendship thing up either but this time, I don't want to regret not trying.  Maybe he'll read this but I don't care.  This is me and this is what I am going through.    God Bless You, Kayla

      So I'm thinkin' we should all get together and start building an ark.  It just keeps raining and raining and raining.   Tonight Renae and I went to see Witness play an acoustic set.  They called themselves something different though because it was just the two of them.  They were really good.  Pete has the most beautiful eyes.....wow, had a moment there.  En Memoria, ah shit Chronic Mass, played an acoustic set.  I like their songs and everything but I'm not so sure I like the band as a whole.  That makes no sense I know but go with it.  We went to the mall after that was done cuz I was hungry and the mall has food.    When I got home I watched the Ashlee Simpson show.  She's just so cute and charming you can't hate her.  Her song "Pieces of Me," is just so cute.  I watched her on TRL today and she said she wrote it about her boyfriend Ryan Cambrera.  Which surprised me because I really like him and he didn't strike me as her type.  That boy reminds me so much of Howie Day and I think we ALL remember how I feel about Howie Day.  Everything from the songs to his look reminds me of Howie.  So I mean, bravo to Ashlee for catchin' Ryan!  I've come to the conclusion that I don't have a boyfriend because I'm too picky.  Or maybe I'm not picky, I just know what I want and haven't found it yet.  But, you know how it is when there's this one boy and because that boy exists, nobody is good enough....I don't know how many guys I've forgotten about because they didn't measure up.  God, why is life so complicated sometimes?  My life is hardly the O.C. but it would be nice to have the answers given to me for a change.  Who am I kidding?  I have a wonderful family and a butt load of friends.  I have a warm bed and food to eat.  Life isn't bad at all.  But the one thing that is missing...a boy.  And a job, but we're not gonna go there.  Why does summer always bring with it the question of one's love life?  Good-night Kayla

      So today's my birthday...yup.  It was really sweet, I had to pick my brother up from school today and all of his friends said happy birthday to me.  Lizzie called around one from where ever she's at in the US to say happy birthday so that was sweet.  Jessica called later and saved me from my boredom.  She treated me to a movie.  We went to see Saved!, it was really good.  The cast was amazing.  However, I do have a soft spot for independent indie flicks.  I came home and sat around for a few hours.     You'll never guess what the school is doing to me.  I received a letter today saying they are withholding my report card until I hand in my Algebra II book that Mr. Healy assigned me.  First off, I've never had Mr. Healy and next I can bring them to the exact cabinet I put my book in.  So now I have to make an unnecessary trip to the school tomorrow and raise some hell for a dumb algebra book.    My family and I went to Manervas for dinner tonight.  I'd never been there before so my dad thought it would be a nice place to take me.  It looks like a place a mob would have their secret meetings.  I found my future husband there.  He's a bus boy.  He's so cute.  He asked if I wanted more water, which clearly translates into, "I love you!" He kept looking at me and I don't know whether it was a, "she's kinda cute," look or a "rich bitch," look because it was kinda dark in there, give me a break.  But my family is far from rolling in the money, we are your average middle class family.  My dad just thought it would be nice to take me to a place I'd never been.  Man, that bus boy was HOT!  Ladies, I'm very confident in saying you'd all agree with me.    ~Kay  countdown until I'm 18...364 more days

      Normally, I leave church on Sunday nights happy and rejuvenated for the week.  Not today, nope.  Father Todd came back for the day and spoke.  He gave an entire sermon on how if you don't believe in EVERYTHING the catholic church teaches you will go to hell.  I shit you not, he said that.  He went on to give examples such as abortion, I think another might have been same sex marriages, one was the use of birth control ex: the pill, condoms, and another was living with someone before marriage and having sex out of wedlock.  I will tell you now I am pro choice, have nothing against same-sex marriages because it has nothing to do with me, am all for the use of birth control, think that it is necessary to live with someone before you marry them so you know what they are really like, and the whole sex before marriage thing is for some people but others find it more special to wait.  So ladies and gents, it looks like I'll be seein' ya in hell!  The catholic church is so conservative, geesh it's the 21st century, join us!  My mommy has been annoying me lately!  She says I don't do enough around the house, which is bullshit.  I do everything she asks me to do.  GRR...Sometimes, I tell you, she just...pisses me off.    45 more minutes and I'm 17.  Only one more year until I'm legal.  I find it sad that I'll have graduated high school before I'll be able to stay out past 11...Legally.    enough whining, It's raining outside and it's the best to fall asleep to so goodnight, Kay

      What a productive Saturday it was.  Today I vacuumed, washed my car and showered all by 5 o'clock.  I know, I thought that was a lot, too. ;-) But anyway on to the real reason I'm posting, to tell you about my b-day supper with my homies...no that doesn't work...my friends.  I met Megan, Logan and Renae at Bennigans.  Alisha and Jessica could not make it because they were out of town so oh well to them.  But I just kinda knew that Justin would be our waiter, I don't know, maybe I'm physic?  Well he was.  I will say this about Justin I've always thought he was a nice guy but ever since he cut his hair...whoa, all that hair was hiding him.  He's really hot.  But back to me, they made me go to the bathroom so they could tell Justin it was my birthday and I wouldn't feel weird about it.  Nothing like standing in a bathroom with nothing to do.  He came with a really big brownie that was yummy!  Of course he had to announce it to the entire restaurant, but he didn't sing so I was thankful.  However the table of literally 22 people brought it upon themselves to sing to me.  So that was really sweet and Renae and I thanked them before leaving.  I must say we were all really good tippers too.  Justin made $20 off of us tonight.  So two days before birthday was really good.  Thanks you guys for coming and eating with me and buying me a present which wasn't necessary.   Luv ya, Kayla  P.S. Megan, if you want to leave a comment on the other one I'll still get it so don't hesitate! Hope your Grandma gets better soon!

      I haven't been updating as much lately because nothing interesting has been going on in my life.  On Tuesday Logan, Renae, Jessica and I went to Old Chicago for dinner.  Renae and I arrived earlier than the other two and told the waitress it was Jessica's birthday...It wasn't, we just wanted the free dessert.  The waitress said that they didn't do any special singing or anything but they did celebrate birthdays and we told her that was fine.  When we were done with our meal, here comes the waitress and the rest of the staff singing happy birthday to Jessica.  But they didn't know her name so they had to sing it again and this time one of the waiters announced to the entire restaurant that it was Jessica's birthday and encouraged them to sing-a-long.  We're proud to say we conned an entire restaurant.  Wednesday, I dragged Renae around the mall picking up job applications.  I'm currently unhappy with my salary, which is nothing.  Thursday is much like Monday in that it is not worth mentioning.  Today, I picked my brother and his friends up from school *cough*nerds*cough*.  I arrived to Edison a bit early because I overestimated the amount of time it would take me to run some errands so I took a drive and found out that Augie isn't too far away.  So since I found Augie I had to find Jessica's dad's house and then I found Summit and Logan lives on Summit.  I knew where I was at all thanks to the sculpture of the Elephant/Mammoth.  My mom and I took care of Alex again tonight so Brian and Tami could go out to eat and shh...Buy my birthday present.  But before that happened my dad, mom and I went to the new Bagel Boy for supper.  I really like it in there, it has a really nice atmosphere.  It gets five stars from me.  Then we went to the Home Depot to buy paint.  I like the Home Depot, my creative side just gushes out.  Our basement will be done pretty soon, so you know what that means...Yes, Renae we will finally have a house to hang out and a good space that no one can bug us.  Now we don't have to drive around town with you saying, "What are we gonna do?" every 20 seconds.  I'm going to go to bed now because I'm kinda tired.  I Love You, ~KAY

      I was going through some files on my computer and came across various things I had written awhile ago to help me cope with some emotions.  So here's one that I really liked re-reading even though I'm not 100% sure what sparked me to write it.     Masks  Every time you pass by We avoid each other’s eyes I continue to walk and wonder why? If you failed to mention something is it still a lie?  Pretending I don’t know  Is a lie I started sometime ago The bitterness is strongly beginning to show I scream inside my head for you to leave to just leave me alone and go  But you don’t know what I do I’m forced to put on my happy mask and say nice things to you My fake smile and cheerful hello seems to have fooled you too If only I could believe it were true  Some time has passed since the last time we met You said you needed to talk and tell me about some things you regret I want to talk but am too upset How could you not tell me?  How can I forget?

      Have you ever watched Room Raiders on MTV?  I was watching that show today as I was making myself fish sticks and I wondered, if some guy went through the contents of my room would he 1) find it interesting and 2) find that it accurately reflects my personality.  Isn't it funny how the different things we own reflect our personalities?    Yesterday my mom and I went to the mall and she bought me my birthday presents.  Mostly Hollister contents with the exception of one piece from Abercrombie.    Today, I slept until 10 which is the lastest I've slept this summer vacation.  I really didn't do anything today.  We went to Calvers after church.  My dad didn't want to go home and since we had been talking about new cars for me over supper we decided to go look at some.  There were some really nice ones out there.  But I just can't ask my parents to buy me a new car...not now.  Their's so many other things they need.  Those things are more important then me riding in style.  I'm just gonna have to suck it up for another year I think.    I love you and good night, ~KAY

      School let out officially eight days ago and as a whole I'm not too impressed with the first week.  Don't get me wrong this weeks has had it's high points but I'm the type of person that does well with nothing to do.  This is why I need to find a job!  I was extremely nieve going into the job hunt thinking I could find one right away.  Nope.    A couple of days ago my nephew Alex fell down the stairs at my older brother's house and broke his wrist.  Now, he is in a cast.  He's two-years-old so it's the cutest cast you've ever seen.  But today he took it off some how so my brother had to bring him to the doctors to get a new one put on.    Last night, I went to Lizzie's house and watched Uptown Girls for the third time.  It's still a cute movie.  Some of Mary-Kathrine's friends stopped by and we had a fun chat.  Today, I took my little brother to the mall for lunch and I dragged him into all of the stores he hates, such as Abercrombie, Hollister, American Eagle, etc.  He's a trooper.  Tonight, I hung out with Renae.  I have finally made it to Wall Lake and the Japanese Gardens.  The Gardens are so pretty.  Oh, and Renae, I agree that Frisbee didn't land behind on accident. ;-)  Later days,  Kay

      When I say... "I am a Christian"  I'm not shouting "I'm clean livin'"  I'm whispering "I was lost",  Now I'm found and forgiven.   When I say..."I am a Christian"  I don't speak of this with pride.  I'm confessing that I stumble  and need CHRIST to be my guide.   When I say... "I am a Christian"  I'm not trying to be strong.  I'm professing that I'm weak  and need HIS strength to carry on.   When I say... "I am a Christian"  I'm not bragging of success.  I'm admitting I have failed  and need God to clean my mess.   When I say... "I am a Christian"  I'm not claiming to be perfect,  My flaws are far too visible but, God believes I am worth it.  When I say... "I am a Christian"  I still feel the sting of pain,  I have my share of heartaches  So I call upon His name.   When I say... "I am a Christian"  I'm not holier than thou,  I'm just a simple sinner  who received God's good grace, somehow.   Erica sent this to me awhile ago as a forward. Every now and then I go back and read it because I think it does a really good job of explaining religion to some people that would otherwise not understand where others are coming from.

       urlLink    This one needs to be explained.  Their was this Dip sign on 32nd street that some kids vandalized and wrote shit on the bottom so it read, "dip shit" Renae and I thought that was so funny and it needed to be remembered.  Needless to say I took the picture with her in it.  So maybe if you squint real hard you can see the word shit painted on, but the glowing of the sign makes it a bit hard on the computer.&nbsp; urlLink

       Countdown is at 20 hours now. I don't do well with sitting on the couch all day watching TV. I need something to keep me busy, I have to be doing something. When I have nothing to do, I think too much. Plus, although others may argue, you can only read for  so  long!  When I was watching TV today, I found A Wedding Story, I always like that one the best out of them all because it's so happy. When the groom was asked to say something about his bride he said that she fit in his nook. Meaning that when he hugs her she fits perfectly, it feels right, and it's the safest place for him to be. I thought that was so sweet! I want to fit into someone's nook! I just want that something to hold on to that feels right.  I'm going to shower now, my hair is gross! ~Kaylala

       Today, I had to wake up early and go babysit again. This is my "job" for the rest of the week, a job I'll put in over 50 hours at. Good news is...40 hours left. Those kids drive me bananas. Debbie, the mom, offered me the job for the entire summer next year. In all honesty, it may be easy money, but I don't want to be a nanny for my summer job again, so I'm going to work extra hard this spring.  At church yesterday, the most incredible sense of calmness came over me. I love going to church and being surrounded by the music and all the people coming together to praise God. I may not agree with everything the church preaches, but I can not deny that I love God. Lizzie and I had a good laugh at my ability to become a nun. I can just see the group meeting now..."What, you can't think that you're going to go to Hell for saying that"..."Good, I'll see you there"...I could never become a nun, that's not what God's plan is for me. But, bless the women that do choose that route. Church is great...the two places I feel safest are at home and at church.       I talked to Emily, I think it was on Saturday night, and we're going to try and have lunch sometime before school starts to catch up on each other's lives. It kinda bothered me the night of the Braid show how Alisha reacted to Steph being there and I don't want Emily and I to ever be like that. Don't get me wrong Steph and Alisha were nice to each other but it's weird knowing how good friends they used to be and then seeing them act a bit awkward around each other. I realize people grow and change but I still want Emily to know the person I've grown into.  I'm surprisingly really tired and it's only 7:30. I think I'm going to go rest for a bit.  I love you, Kay

        A couple of days ago, I read Sean's re-post of Ashley's blog and it brought me to think. She's right, in nine days the class of 2005 will all come together again, for the last time to buy our parking tags, buy our activities sticker, take our ID pictures, and grab our final schedules. This momentous occasion will take twenty minutes if one gets there before the rush, and I too wonder how such a final moment in our lives can possibly be given it's proper good-bye in such a short time span.    Ten months from now, on May 29th at 3 p.m. our class will come together for the last time at graduation. Where we will walk across the stage to receive our diploma. A piece of paper that signifies hard work, achievements, disappointments, and the end. In those ten months many things will happen to us. We'll decide our futures, finalize our pasts, and live in the moment. At the end of this month on August 30th, we officially take rein as the Senior Class of 2005. I hope, as I walk into the school for the last first time, I stop to take a moment to take it all in. I wish you would do the same. This year is going to be hectic and challenging, but always take moments to step back and appreciate what's there.   I love you, Kayla
