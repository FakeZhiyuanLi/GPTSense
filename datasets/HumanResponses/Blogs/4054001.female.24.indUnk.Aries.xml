      I used to dream about being famous. Since childhood, I've fantasized about standing on stage, accepting some prestigious award as I beamed for the cameras and 'profiled' dramatically in my $25,000 outfit. I was going to be that individual who contributed something major to the benefit of humanity that would be remembered for centuries, and possibly, even several millenia. My work would inevitably be celebrated long after I'd been deceased.  I used to think to myself, "Someday the world will know who I am." At age 7, I was a professional idealist, and like most children that age, in my naivety and innocence, I believed I could conquer the entire planet.  My, how blindly optimistic we can be in our youth. Little did I know that there are invisible lines of limitation surrounding brown or black, poverty-stricken inner-city kids. Had someone relayed this to me (placing special emphasis on the seriousness of continuously striving to defy the odds, working twice as hard to shatter any stereotypes, and hurdling clear over any boundaries), I imagine that I would have been a more studious, focused, and goal-oriented pupil - ambitiously battling the currents in an effort to establish a solid identity amid the spectrum of faces in this melting pot of a country.  Instead, I became this: a young, struggling single-mother, working a dead-end desk gig, sitting around on the internet reminiscing. They could've told me that kids like me needed an extra dose of love, encouragement, and self-confidence instilled into them. Beyond that, at least one teacher could've cared enough about me to teach me about my ancestors' roles in this land before I reached adolensence; instead of chocking my head full of great ol' American History Tales &amp; Heroics (but that's another story entirely). Maybe then, I would've had more pride and integrity about myself. Unfortunately, I grew up feeling deprived and cheated. What a way to start out, ey?  Life can be so unpredictable sometimes. Never in a million years would I have fathomed I'd be in the position that I find myself in today. This is not the blueprint I drafted for my future. Somehow that optimistic child with humungous-sized aspirations lost faith in herself and was led astray. No kid ever proclaims, "I want to be a nobody when I grow up."  Alas, can you hear it? Yes, I believe it's the faint sound of a pitiful woman, singing her "should'a, could'a, woulda's. Who will cry for the loser? I often do.  This is my self-pity rant for the day.  Until next time, kiddies... kj

      (Deep sigh)...and so it begins.&nbsp; As I stare into the face of destiny (or is that just the freakin' glare on this computer screen), I feel inspired and ambitious as I embark upon, what will be, my very first blog.&nbsp; The blank posting space stares me in the face, and I smile, for this empty canvas resembles a clean slate for me...or a new car smell.   Then, a light-bulb glistened overheard as the realization of an off-beat comparison occured to me - this is that same "wet behing the ears" feeling that hit me back when it was my first time.&nbsp; Here I am, a virgin all over again; though of course, not literally.&nbsp; No, at 24, that would be too pitiful.   As I end this post, I wish that I had more to say.&nbsp; Unfortunately, time has escaped me, and my shift is up at work.&nbsp; Think the boss knows that I spend most of my free time utilizing their high-speed internet to surf the web and goof off?&nbsp; Yes, the satisfaction of a day well-spent.&nbsp; How productive.&nbsp;   Rest assure though, kiddies! Although this stint was extremely brief today, there will definitely be more interesting thoughts regurgitated onto this particular "blog" in the near future.&nbsp; Prepare to love me.&nbsp;   In due time all...in due time.   One, kj
