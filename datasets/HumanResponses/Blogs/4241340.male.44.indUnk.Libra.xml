      News out of Iraq from brother Ron:  The Internet cafe has finally opened here. Yippee!!! I have to share it with about 1400 Marines and soldiers though. They are not early risers so if I get here around 6am I am good. The platoon leader has finally lifted our restriction and we are now allowed to go out. Not doing much work though, just getting our faces seen so that the chiefs all know that we are still here. The Najaf headquarters was mortared the other day whilst our MPs were there. 6 IPs were killed and 24 were wounded. Ambulances took them to the Najaf Hospital but they were refused treatment by the staff because they were afraid that Monkey Boy would retaliate against them for treating the wounded.  After about 3 hours the Najaf Chief got hold of our language assistant via radio and asked if the medics here could help out. The Army and Marines said "hell yes" and all the wounded were brought here and ultimately medevaced to Babylon.  One IP was definitely not going to make it. He died 3 times while here. Each time they moved him to the side and put a guard on his body. Then he would start breathing again. It was pretty wild to see. Major head trauma. If he lives he will never be the same. The med unit is right next to my hooch so we were able to watch all that was going on.  These IPs were the volunteers that I mentioned earlier in another e-mail. Unpaid and laying their lives down to help get rid of that asshole.  With no Internet and no TV I really have no idea what's going on here. I hear of cease-fires being brokered but then all hell breaks loose. We have artillery here that responds to mortar fire by the insurgents. No offensive ops are being conducted by the Marines here at this time. They only respond to being fired at. Monkey Boy's back is against the wall and he is desperately trying to save his own skin. He has vowed to fight to the death. I wish he would bring his sorry ass out of the shrine and make good on his vows. Coward.  We went to police headquarters yesterday and recovered about 50 mortars of various sizes and some RPGs. Some of the mortars and artillery rounds had been converted to IEDs and then recovered by the IPs along the roadways. The EOD guys did not want to bring the duds and IEDs to the base so we went down the street from the shrine and lit them off. Anything to unnerve the idiots. It made one hell of an explosion.  The Marines and armored unit were out the other night on patrol and asked for illumination rounds from the howitzers here. They raised the muzzles of the guns higher than the fence separating them form the camp and let loose. It was about 130am. The muzzle blast went over the fence and blasted the hell out of our hooch. It sounded like in coming rounds. I got out of bed and checked with the MPs on duty. They all thought that they were in coming until they saw the flares in the distance. This continued until about 4am.  Now that we are able to go out we have learned that they have closed the KBR laundry at FOB Baker. I have been doing all of my laundry by hand and will have to continue to do so til they move the laundry over here. That sux.  That's all I have for now. Keep in touch. Ron   Beer is God's way of showing us that he loves us and wants us to be happy

      Well....We made it back long drive (especially coming back). We managed to leave at about 6:45 a.m. (just a little behind schedule), stopped at our local doughnut shop for coffee and, of course, doughnuts. We made it to Tehachapi before we had to refuel. Found a nice gas station/mini mart and took out a small loan to fill up the car. Gas is not cheap in Tehachapi.  Next stop: Baker. Just a short distance from the California/Nevada border. We had seen several signs for the Mad Greek restaurant. So, temptation got the better of us and we dined there for lunch. Gyros. Ummmmmm. That did the trick, we climed back in the Xterra and headed for Vegas. Check in was fine, although they kind of screwed up our reservations. Shashi pulled some VIP muscle and got the situation taken care of.  We dropped of the luggage, had a couple of cocktails in the room and wandered the casino. We decided on Mexican for dinner. Taco salads for Ann and Ram, enchiladas for Shashi and fish tacos for me.  After dinner, we wandered some more and we retired up stairs. Shashi was exhausted so I put on the walking shoes and headed for Ceaser's to meet up with Frank. After some searching, we found each other, had a couple of drinks and located the cafe so Frank could eat a late meal. We talked a while and parted ways. Tried to get together later but we could never connect.  Friday morning and early afternoon was spent lounging by the pool. After that, Shashi and I took a stroll down the strip, tried our hands at roulette and headed back to the Aladdin. Dinner was to be at Il Fornaio at New York, New York, so we freshened up and headed down the street. After dinner, we returned to the Aladdin, gambled a bit and went to bed.  Saturday morning and early afternoon was again spent at the pool. We then strolled around the Aladdin, had some lunch and strolled some more. We met at PF Chang's for dinner and later headed to bed.  Sunday was spent driving home. Next time, I will fly.

      Sick and tired of reading the same bad news coming out of Iraq. If you believed everything you read or heard, this is a lost cause. You really have to hunt to find the positive things that are not being reported. Lucky for me, I have a source on the ground there. As mentioned in an earlier post,  urlLink  twin brother Ron is there  ; recruiting and training Iraqi police officers. He is currently in Najaf where that asshole al Sadr is quivering in a cemetary making impossible demands of the Iraqi government and US Military. Recently, the media has reported that "dozens" of Iraqi soldiers have deserted in support of the insurgents. More than likely, it is out of cowardice. Now, what you don't hear is that "hundreds" of the residents of Najaf have swarned the Iraqi police stations, volunteering their services to rid their town of these terrorists. They are all local business owners who are suffering during this fighting.  Another thing about the media: Hurricane Charley just finished kicking the shit out of Florida. Over a dozen fatalities and billions of dollars in damages. President Bush flew down there to survey the damage and to promise aid and support for those devastated by this disaster. Of course, the media is spinning this as a political move since Florida is a swing state. Sorry W:  Damned if you do and damned if you don't . Those dickheads don't cut you a single break, do they?

      Just reading how the Hollywood elite is complaining about their right to free speech is being infringed upon and they are hesitant on speaking their minds for fear of fallout. Bad news for you wieners: If the government causes you grief, then you have a complaint.  But  if your fan base of the general public gives you grief, that is their right. If I choose to boycott an actor (Like Susan Sarandon) because of her political views and her outspoken nature, that is my right as an American. Let us take Linda Ronstadt for example: Escorted from the Aladdin Casino and Resort for dedicating a song to the American Hero: Michael Moore. If I were a member of the audience, I would have walked out as many did. Her departure from the place was not because her right to free speech was violated, it is because she violated the terms of her contract: Sing songs and entertain. It took guts for the president of the casino to do this and this is the reason I have chosen to stay at the Aladdin during my stay there this week.  And Michael Moore: I have one word for him: Cortislim! You fat, frumpy, Un-American bastard! I guess the 911 Commission's report kind of took the fire our of Farenheit 911, you half-truth telling jerk.  And Janeane Garafalo. What qualifies you to insert your two cents? I heard the encounter you had with Larry Elder and your remarks about him being a schill for the Repulican Party and calling him a "House Negro". This remark after calling members of the Repuablican Party racist.  Oh the double standards applied by the liberals of this country.

        Well  , it looks like the troops are again rolling toward  Najaf . I have no problem with what they are doing. Just wish they would finish off with this little coward. Seems the only time he calls a truce is when he is getting his ass whipped and needs the bullets to stop flying so he can regroup and refit. What the US needs to do is have some well placed snipers around the clock to wait for the opportunity. But those are just my thoughts on the matter.  Fortunately Brother Ron was in vacation in Thailand when the shit hit the fan and is stuck in Babylon until there is a lull in the fighting.  What else....Oh. Getting ready to head to " Sin City " for a few days of fun in the sun. Not much on gambling. Probably sit by the pool and have some pool drinks. Old army buddy  urlLink   Frank    will be there for work related issues. Great time to get together.  That is all for now.
