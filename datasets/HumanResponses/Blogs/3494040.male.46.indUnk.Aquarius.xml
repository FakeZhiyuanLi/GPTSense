      First entry on this new blog. Never really got on with  blogging  but I'll give it a go so at least I can make an online record of my travels in Europe. Now I've set this up of course I have to leave it now, people coming round, things to do! It was ever thus!

      Hello, In Innsbruck at the moment on a visit from Mittelwald where I am staying in Germany. having fun climbing up mountains and discovering how unfit I really am! Having a good time, germany is clean and very efficient (yes, that about covers it I think!)People are friendly enough but not overmuch! Wait till we beat them at Football! Mountains are great and weather hasnt been too bad except for the day at Neuscwanstein, ha! Innsbruck is very busy and has a real cosmopolitan feel to it, this is actually the first place Ive stopped at that Id been to before, although can't remember much about the first time! Rooms have been nice, and they are fairly inexpensive so I've been a bit of a wimp and avoided having to use the tent, I suspect that nmay happen in Italy where I am going tomorrow. The plan at the moment is to drive from Mittelwald to Riva del Garda by Lake Garda in Italy: we shall see! Hope all is well,  Johann im Auttriche!

      Hello again, here I am still in Germany in a small town in the Alps called Germisch. A skiing resort really but not much snow about! Travelled down this morning from Ulm where I spent the night. Ulm is your typical cathedral town and was quite lively and bustling. Climbed the spire of the cathedral which is the highest in the World apparently (certainly when I had reached the top I could see no other spire taller, so that proves that I suppose. Passed a party of schoolkids from Bracknell on the way down, we compared notes and decided it wasn´t a patch on Princess Square! Had pizza last night on the Danube which flowes through Ulm. Watched a bit of the game (Ger v Hol) which is obviously a big thing over here. (I was speaking to someone the other evening about the apparent lack of enthusiasm in Germany for Euro 2004 and that in England and Holland there where flags etc everywhere. He said that in Germany they tend to play down such overt nationalism and people tend to be a little embarrased about the whole flag waving thing because of their-ahem- recent experiences. Which is fair enough I suppose). So this morning drove down from Ulm to the Alps. First stop was the Schwarmbau(?) site of Neuscheswanstein Schloss which is the most famous of mad king Ludwigs fairytale castles. (The most famous site in Germany and tourist central!!!). A fabulous castle set in fabulous alpine scenery...That is I´m told it is, alas it was raining and I could only see about 50 mtrs ahead! For all I know it was a 2 bed terrace surrounded by a barren wasteland! Bloody weather, bloody Zidane! Never mind I had an invigorating walk to Marienbrucke´which is a rickety bridge over a gorge with magnificent views of the Schloss, although once again I´ll have to take their word for that! Have to go now, my time is running out! See you soon John!

      Hello All, Tuesday morning now in Ulm in Southern Germany. Writing this in an Internet cafe on a Mac, with a German keyboard, using Netscape navigator...(I won´t bore you with the web design stuff but this is certainly an argument for checking out your designs on different platforms, browsers etc!) having a good time apart from Sunday evening of course, sat through the whole game with a smile on my face in a crowded german bar  until the last few minutes: bloody Zidane! Travelling steadily though Germany. First stop after Aachen was in Koblenz which is a picturesque city at the confluence of the Mosel and Rhine rivers, very pretty! Stayed in some nice places, my lack of German isn´t proving too much of a problem I just look stupid and mumble "Keine deutsch" or something equally inane! Driving is fun, roads are certainly a lot faster than in the UK although strangely enough there are more roadworks!  Koblenz was in the middle of a Happy Gymnastics event which basically involved various stages being set up thoughout the town and various aerobic/dance displays taking place. All women strangely enough I think the Daily Mail would have problems with some of the younger troupes though! In the evening the stages were given over to live music so it was very livel y and very busy!  After Koblenz I stayed for a few days in a small picture postcard  town called Bad Wimpfen, very German! Drove down here this morning, probably go on to the alps next, I am tempted by going East to Berchtesgaden or West to Bodensee but n ot sure yet, nice to have the choice! hope everyone who reads this is doing well, I'm having fun hope you all are! John 

      Hello all! I´m in Aachen which is in Germany very close to the Dutch border. Stayed last night in Kerklade in Holland just so that I could say I'd travelled to 5 countries in one day! (UK, France, Belgium, Germany and Holland, if you didn't know!). Siting drinking vending machine coffee in an Internet cafe, I should of course be sitting outside the Rathaus sampling the pavement cafes but then I wouldn't be able to do this would I? (German keyboards are very different to UK ones so any spelling mistakes are not mine okay!)  Having a good trip so far, Aachen is a very nice, bustling not too touristy city, haven't been to the Dom (cathedral) yet but will shortly. Spending the morning here then driving down the Rhine to Koblenz where I hope to spend a couple of days.   Yesterday I spent the afternoon trying to indulge my curiousity about all things Napoleon by visiting Waterloo just south of Brussels. Alas the Belgiums don´t seem at all impressed by havng the site of one of histories most famus battles on their patch and there was little to see! (To be fair the battleground is spread over several kilometres but there is a large man made mound "Butte de Lion" which has a memorial to Wellington on it, but couldn´t find that! I did see it from a distance though but it kept hiding from me!)I suspect the Belgiums are just so fed up with people invading their country and fighting battles on it that they don´t particularly want to make a big thing about it! Driving is great fun here, the roads in Germany and Holland are certainly an improvement on some of the ones in Belgium. Haven´t got lost yet (it may happen!), but have spent quite a bit of time sampling the delights of driving round Waterloo nd Kerklade looking for things! Nearly finished my lovely coffee so will sign off and catch up again soon, take care, John
