      The ANNOTICO Report  "Facing Windows" is now being released in the US, after being a multiple award winner In Italy, stars Massimo Girotti, Giovanna Mezzogiorno, Filippo Nigro, and Raoul Bova.  Massimo Girotti died of a Heart Attack at the age of 84, January 2003, one month before "Facing Windows" opened in Italy.  Massimo Girotti, who appeared in over 100 films, was one of Italy's legendary leading men, was a championship athlete, before his 1939 screen debut, and gained popularity in virile action roles. Long before Kirk Douglas, Girotti played Spartacus in the same-named 1952 European historical epic.  Massimo posthumously won the David Di Donatello Award for best actor for his touching performance in "Facing Windows"— the only time in his career Girotti was nominated for the David.   Girotti's complete Filmography follows the La Times Article.   ================================================================================ MOVIES AN ITALIAN ACTOR'S FINAL TRIUMPH Los Angeles Times By Susan King Jun 14 2004  The Italian import "Facing Windows," which opens Friday, is not only a multiple award winner on its home turf; the drama marks the swan song of one of the country's legendary leading men, Massimo Girotti.  Written and directed by Ferzan Ozpetek, "Facing Windows" concerns an unhappily married young couple, Giovanna (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) and Filippo (Filippo Nigro), who discover a well-dressed elderly man (Girotti) wandering the streets in a confused state. Despite Giovanna's protests, Filippo brings the man home with the promise that he will take him to the police. But he doesn't, and soon the man's presence begins to have an effect on Giovanna's life.  Even with him in the apartment, though, Giovanna continues to gaze out a window to the flat opposite hers, where resides a handsome young bachelor (Raoul Bova). One night the bachelor helps Giovanna find the old man after he wanders off, and they begin a relationship. Meanwhile, the old man starts to put the pieces of his life back together.  In January 2003, Girotti died of a heart attack at age 84. A month later, "Facing Windows" opened in Italy and was a triumph for the actor. He posthumously won the David Di Donatello Award for best actor for his touching performance — the only time in his career Girotti was nominated for the David.  A former athlete and engineering student, Girotti began in films in 1939 and quickly became one of Italy's leading heartthrobs and a favorite of such directors as Roberto Rossellini ("Desiderio"), Luchino Visconti ("Ossessione") and Bernardo Bertolucci ("Last Tango in Paris"). Although Girotti worked on more than 100 films and made countless TV appearances, "Facing Windows" was his first project in five years.  ====================================================================== >From All Movie Guide: A champion athlete before his 1939 screen debut, Italian actor Massimo Girotti gained popularity in virile action roles. Long before Kirk Douglas, Girotti played Spartacus in the same-named 1952 European historical epic. He also showed up in such brooding melodramas as Ossessione (1942), an unauthorized Italian version of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice. Massimo Girotti later essayed character roles, notably in 1971's The Red Tent and 1972's Last Tango in Paris. ~ Hal Erickson ======================================================= FILMOGRAPHY Massimo Girotti  Actor: Born May 18, 1918 - Mogliano, Italy   2003 Facing Windows Actor: Davide   1994 The Monster Actor: Distinguished resident   1992 Dall'Altra Parte Del Mondo Actor: Aureliano   1989 Rebus Actor   1987 La Boheme Actor: Old Suitor   1985 Quo Vadis?

So  the straw pig went running over to the stick pig's house and said "Please let me  in, the wolf just blew down my house. So the stick pig let the straw pig in.  Just then the wolf showed up and said, "I'm gonna huff and puff and blow your  house down." And he did!!!! So the straw pig and the stick pig went running over  to the brick pig's house and said, "Let us in, let us in, the big bad wolf just  blew our houses down." So the brick pig let them in just as the wolf showed up.  The wolf said "I'm gonna huff and puff and blow your house down." The straw pig  and the stick pig were so scared! But the brick pig picked up the phone and made  a call. A few minutes passed and a big, black stretch limo pulls up. Out step  two massive pigs in pin striped suits and fedora hats. These pigs come over to  the wolf, grab him by the neck and beat the living shit out of him, then one of  them pulled out a gun, stuck it in his mouth and fired killing the wolf, then  they got back into their limo and drove off. The straw pig and the stick pig  were amazed!!! "Who the hell were those guys?" They asked. "Those were my  cousins from Jersey, the Guinea Pigs."   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON PINOCCHIO   The following is an excerpt form the Annotico report.   Pinocchio is very much an Italian story. It is full of Northern Italian  landscapes and Italian dishes. It also embodies the traditional Italian belief  that the family is of central importance. You can have a good time with your  friends, but you can only truly trust your kin. Good parents will sacrifice  themselves for their children without a murmur, as Geppetto does when there is  nothing to eat in the house but three pears, and he allows Pinocchio to devour  them all. Good children will also sacrifice themselves for their parents, as  Pinocchio does when he and his father, like Jonah in the Bible, escape from the  belly of the Great Shark, and he carries Geppetto out of the sea on his  back.

By Adam Thierer   Like millions of other Americans, I will be glued to my television set on  Sunday night watching the season finale of HBO's critically acclaimed series The  Sopranos to see who "gets it," or even just to hear Tony or one of his mobster  buddies say "Forgetaboutit!" one last time this season. But one person who  definitely won't be watching The Sopranos finale on Sunday night is my young  daughter. The violence, profanity, and sexual content are not something I want  her exposed to. I'm not sure what the right age is for children to see such  programming, but at the point my wife and I think she's ready, we'll talk to her  about such shows before we sit down to watch them with her.

The significance of which was  hardly lost on Travaglini's Senate colleagues.   "He's been called by many names &#8212; Bob, Bobby, Trav, Senator, Senatore &#8212; but  henceforth he will be known and answered to as Mr. President," said  Greek-American Senator Steve Panagiotakos. Gushed Irish-American Senator Therese  Murray of Plymouth: This is truly a great country "when a kid from the  neighborhood can be elected the first [Senate] president of Italian descent."  Travaglini's own mother, Josephine, wept in the gallery when his nomination for  the Senate presidency was moved and seconded.   NOTE: This insightful and very revealing article is well worth reading in its  entirety.

Governor John Rowland smeared with anti Italian American comment   In an Northeast Magazine article by Bill Heald a vowel was added at the end  Governor John Rowland's name to read Rowlando. This was a double smear since it  attempted to connect Rowland with criminal activities at the expense of Italian  Americans who are generally regarded to be criminally bent by most of the  American public.   Chicago councilman's comment   While discussing the selection of a particular contractor for The city's bus  stop ad benches, Chicago City Council Finance Committee meeting, veteran Fifth  Ward Alderman Lawrence Bloom Remarked, "I don't know who's in that company, but  his name shouldn't end in a vowel".   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   TRUE WORDS FROM THE WRONG SOURCE   For years now, a growing number of my constituents have been of Italian  descent and I've come to know them well. They have honored me with their support  and with their friendship. Indeed I can proudly say that some of my very best  friends are Italian Americans...These hearings on the Mafia are in no way  whatsoever a slur upon the great Italian people. Because I can state from my own  knowledge and experience that Italian Americans are among the most loyal, most  law-abiding, patriotic, hard-working American citizens in this land. And it  would be a shame, Mr. Chairman, if we allowed a few rotten apples to give a bad  name to the whole barrel. Because from the time of the great Christopher  Columbus up through the time of Enrico Fermi, right up until the present day,  Italian Americans have been pioneers in building and defending our great nation.  They are the salt of the earth, and they're one of the backbones of this  country.   NOTE: These lines are from the senator in The Godfather I. Too bad real U.S.  senators including Italian Americans do not give such well earned praise.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------  University student Michael Taormina was one of only 40 students in the nation to qualify for the National Italian American Foundation program, which sent him on a two-week trip to Italy with all expenses paid.  Erik R. Bishoff Photo Editor  Student explores heritage in Italy ------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------  An all-expenses-paid trip allowed an Italian American University student to learn more about his culture Reese Lee Freelance Reporter June 24, 2004   Many college students can't afford a trip overseas, so one option is to win an all-expenses-paid trip, which is what University student Michael Taormina did.  The sophomore physics major visited Italy from May 23 to June 5 on a trip sponsored by the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) under its Gift of Discovery program.   "It was an opportunity that presented itself," Taormina said of his lucky break.   NIAF gave Taormina and 39 other Italian Americans10 days in the Campania region of Italy, touring famous sites like the ruins of Pompeii and Paestum. Taormina then stayed in Rome for several days.   The itinerary included meetings with students at a high school and technical institute in Salerno, visits to Vietri sul Mare on the Amalfi Coast and its ceramic producers, as well as an intensive Italian lesson. Taormina was selected to travel with the group after NIAF reviewed his background, academics, letters of recommendation, and essays he submitted.   Brock Olivo, NIAF Assistant of Educational Programs and chaperone of Taormina's group, said Taormina "obviously attracted someone's eye and got a high grade."   Taormina said he wanted to continue touring Italy, but had to return to Eugene for spring-term finals.   "That was the worst part about the trip," he said.   Taormina said the best part of the trip was the group he traveled with.   "There are 40 kids in a group, and you have to do everything together, so you have to get to know them pretty fast," he said. "It was a cool experience."   He also liked going with people who know the country.   "It's a happy medium, as opposed to if you had gone by yourself or with a commercial tour group," he said.   Prior to this trip, Taormina only knew about his Italian heritage through his family and relatives.   "Growing up in a small town in Eastern Oregon, you don't get a big Italian community, like in New York," he said.   Taormina recalled an amusing story from his trip.   "Two other students and I had strayed from the group, and we started talking to these three kids," he said. "Suddenly their mother and grandmother came out and dragged us into their house to eat."   Olivo remembers the incident.   "We were in this little mountain town, and we had just exited a church," Olivo said. "There was a long walk through the town to the bus, and Michael and two other kids were literally dragged into a house!"   He added, "I opened the door and there was a table full of food and wine and cheese and kids, and there in the middle of it all was Michael and two other students, stuffing their faces."   Olivo also said Taormina got a lot out of the trip.   "Michael is a shining example of an Italian American," Olivo said. "He was [mature] beyond his years, receptive to the speakers and tour guides. He soaked it up and took it in." Rich Santoro, NIAF Manager of Youth Programs, said applicants have to show an interest in their heritage.   "The goal of the program is to bond Italian American students with their heritage by bringing them to Italy, to show them the roots of where their heritage lies," he said.

As it is painfully clear,she frankly admits that it would be impossible to use negative stereotypes for other groups, but does not explain why it is all right to do so for Italian Americans.  If you would like to write to her, her address is nozlu@artsusa.org  Luigi Bonaffini    I was frankly appalled today when I came across your Caravaggio ad in the New York Times.  It is not enough for Italian Americans to be constantly bombarded by Hollywood and the media with the usual vulgar mobster stereotype, now we are getting it from an organization like Americans for the Arts. Mind you, I am not implying any malicious intent on your part, but this ad is misguided, ill-conceived, and downright offensive. I am assuming that you meant to suggest that not all Italian names are mob connected, and that Italian culture is much more than that. Considering the fact that only an infinitesimally small percentage of Italian Americans are involved with organized crime (0.002%, as close to 0% as you can get), it is really very hard to understand why an ad about Caravaggio by a cultural organization should have to mention the Sopranos. And if that were not enough, you mention Mario Puzo's novels and, finally, you administer the coup de grâce, scraping the bottom of the barrel, with "Fuhgedaboudit".  No matter what you intentions might have been, the only effect your ad will have will be to reinforce the ugly stereotype of the Italian mobster and the fact that if you talk about Italians, then you must mention the Sopranos and the Mafia.  This ad was a terrible mistake and you need to pull it immediately.    Mr. Bonaffini,  We've received wonderful praise for our ad series, including several Italian-American organizations. The point of the ad is that most Americans don't know who the greatest artists in the world are and by using pop references through word association, it really helps to make the point. Our ad campaign won the highest prize by the National Association of Newspapers for our arts education campaign.  This campaign has been in place for 3 years and you are the first person to have interpreted the ad as an offense towards Italian-Americans, which clearly was not our intention.  Thank you for taking the time to contact us. All opinions are welcomed.  Sincerely,  Nina Ozlu  Vice President, Government and Public Affairs  Americans for the Arts    Dear Ms. Ozlu,  I want to thank you for your prompt reply.  Again, I do not in any way question your intentions, only the choices made in the ad, and the need to use negative stereotypes to make the point. To be more blunt, if this had been an ad about Isaac Stern, would you have said : "No wonder people think Isaac Stern is a Jewish Shylock"? How about a Spanish singer? "No wonder people think Amancio Prada is a kingpin" If the answer is no, as I think it is, then you need to ask yourself why it is all right to use negative stereotypes when Italians are involved.  Since you say that several Italian American organizations praised the ad, I will post it on a couple of Italian American forums and we'll see what they say.  Luigi Bonaffini     Actually, you should take a look at our entire print ad series. We do a double play on artists' names through similar sounding pop references. I think you'll then see how the examples you bring up would never happen for MANY reasons.  Martha Graham - snack cracker?  Louis Armstrong - 1st man to walk on the moon?  Man Ray - a poisonous jellyfish?  Tchaikovsky - gesundheit?  Thanks for getting back to me. Nina      I'm afraid the examples you give confirm without a doubt what I said to you. They are not similar sounding pop references, as you suggest, because they are harmless wordplay and not one of them alludes to an ugly negative stereotype, except for the Caravaggio ad. You rightly say that the examples I gave you would never happen for MANY reasons, and I of course agree. It is no doubt unthinkable to use Jewish or Latino stereotypes, and rightly so because they are vulgar and offensive, yet you could not think of a single reason why using the mobster stereotype is inappropriate.  Thanks again for your response.  Luigi Bonaffini    At this point, we are going to have to kindly agree to disagree. My points are not changing your mind and your points are not changing my mind. The only thing we do agree on is that there was no intention to offend Italian-Americans.

Your replies to Professor Bonaffini, culminating in we are going to have to kindly agree to disagree, are simply not acceptable. If you honestly dont understand what is wrong with your replies, go see Spike Lees BAMBOOZLED. He has done a wonderful job of lampooning replies such as yours. While I would like to believe that your campaign and your replies were simply naïve errors, the public affairs person in the film is clearly revealed to be deliberately and programmatically racist. But even you, however subconsciously, reveal that you are aware of the defamatory nature of the ad when you write I think you'll then see how the examples you bring up would never happen for MANY reasons in response to Professor Bonaffinis suggestion that an analogous campaign about Isaac Stern might say "No wonder people think Isaac Stern is a Jewish Shylock"? How about a Spanish singer? "No wonder people think Amancio Prada is a [drug] kingpin." Among the Many reasons for which the defamation of Jewish Americans, Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Native Americans, etc. would never happen is that there is no doubt that Americans for the Arts would have to grovel as it begged for forgiveness and that you would be instantly terminated.    I join Professor Bonaffini and Mr. Fiore in inviting you to pull the ad immediately. I also join them in asking you identify the Italian-American organizations that have heaped wonderful praise on your ad series and to share their comments with us.    Cordially,   Ben Lawton     New York Times, Sunday June 20th   NO WONDER PEOPLE THINK CARAVAGGIO IS A GUY ON THE SOPRANOS.     It's hard to believe. Here's a 16th  century Baroque master whose bold naturalistic painting style first created a sensation, then a movement, A guy whose life was filled with the turbulence and excess of more than a dozen Mario Pugo novels.  This guy who, while troubled, ultimately found redemption and immortality in his art. But does the average kid on the street even know who Caravaggio is?   Fuhgedaboudit.    Too bad. Especially when you consider how much our children ca earn from the conflicted life of a great artist like Michelangelo Caravaggio.   Hee grew up in less than ideal circumstances. Most of his family died in the plague. Much of his youth was misspent on the mean streets of Rome And as a young artist he struggled for years a living. He was angry. Yet the angry contrast' between light and darkness in his work is the very reason why it now hangs in countless museums around the world. If nothing else, it's a case study of the importance of having art as an outlet. Unfortunately, one we're fast removing from our kids' lives.   (Caption of a painting by Caravaggio)  Honestly, he wouldn't last ten minutes on the Sopranos         I am posting my entire exchange with Nina Ozlu, Vice President, Government and Public Affairs, Americans for the Arts.

Thanks, Nina     Ms. Ozlu:   Luigi Bonaffini has shared his recent exchanges with you regarding the above referenced ad by posting them on several Italian American message boards.     Mr. Bonaffini did a more than adequate job in addressing the double standard that's so pervasive in pop culture specifically regarding how one, particular ethnic group (Italian Americans) are abused with impunity in a manner that no one in their right mind would do with other groups.  So I will not elaborate further.    For the sake of clarity, however, would you kindly elaborate on your response "...I think you'll then see how the examples you bring up would never happen for MANY reasons"...one of those many reasons wouldn't be "good taste and sensitivity", would it?   Additionally, would you be so kind as to identify which Italian American organizations voiced approval of the ad?  Perhaps if we can contact them, they'll be able to help us understand and correct our hypersensitivity.

MEN OF THE CLOTH PRESENTATION    CARVAGGIO LINKED TO THE SOPRANOS  "No Wonder People Think Caravaggio is a Guy on the Sopranos", this  was the Americans for the Arts ad title in the June 20 issue of the  New York Times. The ad went on with more defamatory statements not  only connecting Caravaggio, the great Italian Baroque artist to the  Sopranos, but to Mario Puzo's novels as well. "But does the average  kid on the street even know who Caravaggio is? Fuhgedaboudit." Was  another ill chosen phrase used in the ad.  However the most  offensive was the caption under a portrait of Caravaggio  reading, "Honestly, he wouldn't last ten minutes on the Sopranos."  Thanks to Professor Luigi Bonifini who spotted the ad there was a  huge response from the ever uniting Italian American community.   Letters of protest were sent by NIAF, OSIA, IAOV, UNOCO and Italian  American Pride which sent a letter containing this excerpt; "Let's  give you the substitution test and see if you'd have printed this  ad: Replace Michelangelo Mersi da Caravaggio with Marc Chagall,  a.k.a. Mark Zakharovich Shagal and use the Yiddish phrase of "oi  vai" instead of fuhgedaboudit. Rewrite the caption to  read. "Honestly, he wouldn't last ten minutes as Shylock in  Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice."  How do you think the Jewish  American community would have reacted?

Food giant Parmalat, Italy's eighth-largest  industrial empire, collapsed late last year amid fraud accusations  against top company executives and scandal involving several major  players from the world of international finance.  Several changes in governmental oversight of business practices in  Italy are taking shape, all allegedly intended to "clean up" the  system which led to shoddy practices. But while the changes will  likely make Italy more palatable to international finance, an  innocent party-the international working class, beginning with  15,000 Parmalat employees who face the loss of their jobs-will be  the ones punished.    Note. The only Parmalat employees who have been creating the any  real wealth for the company are the ones who will be let go.   BOOOKS FOR ITALIAN AMERICAN CHILDREN  Books for children on Italian/Italian American themes are available  but not widely distributed on the shelves of bookstores, libraries  or even in our homes. The influence of children's literature upon  the psyches of the young is known to be significant. The books have  to be present and be used in order to effect any positive influence  upon the children. The positive images of Italian heritage can be  learned during childhood via books read to them at bedtime, picture  and resource books being available on the shelves of their homes and  libraries, and giving them gift books for birthdays and holidays.  Positive self-esteem about their Italian Heritage can help children  withstand the barrage of negative ethnic stereotyping in the media  they will encounter later on.  For more information and a listing of recommended books please go  to: http://www.sonsofitalypa.org/booklist.htm    ITALIAN AMERICANS NOT A MINORITY  In the Philadelphia case of Joseph Ricco (real name Joseph Gavel)  six Italian Americans were excluded from serving because of their  ethnicity.  Although protested, the court ruled that Italian  Americans could be excluded since they are not considered to have  minority status.  Please read the following and come to your own  conclusion.  Ethnicity and race: General indexes  Typically, members of a minority group share a sense of solidarity  and a desire to preserve their culture, traditions, religion, or  language. A minority group can sometimes be a numerical majority in  a minority group position. Minority group status is not a matter of  numbers; it is determined by the presence of distinguishing features  such as discrimination. Central features characterizing a minority  group are:  .	The members of a minority group suffer various disadvantages  at the hand of another group;  .	A minority group is identified by group characteristics that  are socially visible;  .	A minority is a self-conscious group with a strong sense  of "oneness";  .	People usually do not become members of a minority group  voluntarily; they are born into it;  .	By choice or necessity, members of a minority group tend to  marry within the group."     MEN OF THE CLOTH PRESENTATION  The Genius of Vicki Vasilopoulos was clearly evident at the private  screening of her documentary, "Men of the Cloth".  The work in  progress was presented at the Coccia Institute for the Italian  Experience in America at the Montclair State University in New  Jersey.   It is indeed a credit to Ms, Vasilopolous' talent for taking a  mundane topic as tailoring and turning it into a work of art. The documentary was filmed in the United States and in Italy and is  being funded by grants and donations.  NIAF is a principal grantor.   Additional funding is needed to complete this story of a fading art. The film is expected to be aired across the U.S and Europe.  PBS is  a likely outlet for this splendid documentary.

Date: 	Sat, 26 Jun 2004 08:13:02 -0700 (PDT) From: 	Lawrence Tamanini   To: 	D-Candeloro@govst.edu    The question WHY there is an absence of Italaian American theatre companies is a good question. When you  consider what is taking place on the boards right now, it adds to your question ten fold.  I have stated and have proved beyound a shadow of a doubt that Italian Americans do not support their artists. The only artists that receive any reconition are ones portraying Italian Americans in the most negative light. (Please, don't waste any time trying to prove this statement wrong.) It all comes down to that the powers that be make TONS of money ! Furthermore, the taste of Italian Americans has now sunk to a low that is equal to, or worst then , the general population.  As far as the Italian American organizations are concerned they are equally at fault and their taste for the arts is almost non exsistent. Yes, every year they'll honor some flat singing tenor but 99% of the time they, the leaders of these organizations, don't have a clue and it gives me the impression that frankly, they don't care. Yes, they'll wait and come out with statements against the portrayal of Italian Americans as gangsters et al . Stick their hands in their pockets....please, thats whats truly needed but then they have to form a committee composed of people whose knowledge of the arts can be written on the back of a match book cover.  If the past actions of Italian Americans and the organizations are any indicator then the future for Italian American artists as it pertains to FINANCIAL support from their own Italian Americans community will be as it is...lip service only, whinning about the explotation of Italian Americans in films, the theatre and litature.

      Each of the listed defamation incidents was handled within the  limitations of our financial and staffing resources. We have  therefore relied extensively on the power of the internet in  recruiting members of our community through the Italian American One  Voice Coalition website who have had willingness and passion to join  the battle against our detractors.    While we cannot claim a perfect success rate we have indeed been  effective in making our voice heard and have changed the thinking of  many who have initially slandered us through different mediums.  Our  campaign in prompting Coca cola to remove and offensive film short  drew a positive response quickly. Radio and TV personality, Laura  Nachman who was initially recalcitrant ultimately saw the  justification in our ire and issued a most sincere apology.    There has been great benefit from our efforts even where we have not  won the day since our protests were duly registered and that will  have a residual value for the future.  Following is the listing of issues we have responded to:   July, 03  It was stated on a radio talk show that the marital infidelity of  Kobe Bryant who is facing rape charges could be traced to his  exposure to the Italian culture.  Bryant spent his early years  growing up in Italy.  The talk show host did not waste the  opportunity to mock with an exaggerated accent.   August, 03  Yonkers mayor John Spencer refuses to apologize for his statement  that contractor Carl Petrillo was a backroom gommbah.    October, 03  John Discepolo of Fox 5 was asked by his boss Neal Goldstein to don  a comical hat and to play a character named Guido, Descepolo refused  on the grounds that is was offensive to his Italian American  identity. Goldstein did not see any offense in his request.   November, 03  Author Randy White used derogatory phrases of WOP Dago and Grease  ball in his book, Everglades.   Coca Cola movie short, Mafia Madness depicted Italian Americans as  running a theater and strong-arming the audience to recall the name  of the movie and the size of the Coke they were drinking.   December, 03  Comic Charley Chiarelli used extreme vulgarity in his performance  that blatantly stereotyped Italians and Italian Americans.   Cingular commercial in which a little boy sitting on Santa's lap  tries to bribe Santa into giving him a phone?  The little boy speaks  in a NY "tough guy" dialect and the commercial ends with him  saying "capesch" to Santa.    January, 04   "Godfathers & Goodfellas" billed itself as the organized crime  trivia game which is a take off from Trivial Pursuit bills itself as  the Organized Crime Trivia Game.   Homies toy figurines called Palermos Italian Mafia.   Human Resources Magazine article titled Resolving Conflict Soprano  Style.  Magic Hands Freddy, an Off Broadway play with offensive dialog whose  main characters are Italian American brothers and their Italian born  sweetheart who they share.   February, 04  PBS series, "The Medicis: Godfathers of the Renaissance" used the  Mob theme in denigrating an historical Italian family and  Catholicism in one script.   Laura Nachman who covers television and radio sports for the Courier  Times stated that, "Since Dan Marino had decided not to join the Miami Dolphins front office, he'll remain with HBO's "Inside the  NFL.", maybe Tony Soprano gave him an offer he couldn't refuse."  Konica Minolta ad using an Italian sounding character with broken  English to dramatize the need for the unit's color graphics.   Staples commercial with the Don of the supplies and Godfather type  music in the background.  "Good Morning America" (Channel 7 WABC).  Weatherman Bill Evans gave a birthday gift to Bill Bartelstein.  Mr. Evans  reassured Mr. Bartelstein it was an authentically autographed  baseball. But, directly thereafter he said, "no only kidding, I got  it from 'Vinnie the Goomba' off the street"   The Sunday edition of The Hartford Courant ran a piece that took aim  at Gov. Rowland's current political problems by presenting him as a  corrupt Italian American by adding a vowel at the end of his name.     April, 04  Justice Scalia shown in a newspaper cartoon hiding in the bushes  with Dick Cheney on a duck hunting trip.  Cheney is well dressed in  the standard business suit and holding a shotgun while Scalia in  unshaven dressed in a wide lapel pinstriped suit holding a  machinegun.   Rendering Unto Caesar's Subjects, an impending PBS series departs  from true history by depicting ancient Rome as a, "dirty, wild  savage city akin to Mexico City and Bombay."    May, 04  A Port Jefferson, New York Town Trustee stated while walking on an  inspection of a new restaurant that it looked like it was renovated  by a "Real Guinea".  The owner of the restaurant, Guy Lombardi  requested our support.   June, 04  A full page ad in the New York Times by The Americans for Art linked  Caravaggio, the great 16 century baroque artist with the Sopranos  and used a sopranoesque caption under his portrait saying, "Honestly  he would not last ten minutes on the Sopranos."       One of our most important undertakings has been in sensitizing the  media which has been has shown a complete contempt for our standing  in the American society and those in our own community who see no  defamation to Italian Americans.  This has been accomplished through  appearances on radio and TV talk shows, letter writing campaigns,  phone calling, Internet message posting and talks at group  gatherings. Our hope is to expand this effort in the coming year by  reaching out to college students of Italian descent.  The Shark Tale initiative has unquestionably consumed hundreds of  hours of our time, however, that is only one of our two major  concentrations. We have been principally involved in the upcoming  symposium on Italian American defamation to be held at Seton Hall  University in New Jersey.  After encouraging such a program for  several years it has now become a reality.  "Real Stories:  Discrimination and Defamation of Italian Americans" will be  presented December, 4, 04.  There will be film showings and panel  discussions.  Films will focus on the tragedies such as the 46  lynchings that have occurred throughout our early history in  America.  Panel discussions will conducted with prominent  politicians, scholars, media critics and representatives from the  major Italian American organizations.

      Friday, August 06, 2004  Agriculturalists in Sicily have formed co-ops and taken over fields once held by gangsters. They see their niche produce as an anti-crime effort.  Los Angeles Times By Tracy Wilkinson Times Staff Writer August 5, 2004  SAN GIUSEPPE JATO, Italy — Antonio Castro, a young agronomist with mud on his boots and sun in his skin, says he can't let himself think too much about the previous owners of the land he farms: Sicily's most ruthless Mafia bosses.  If he spent time worrying that the owners might get out of jail and return to kill him, he wouldn't be able to get his work done.  But after dark, when he settles in for the night at the newly renovated stone villa (and future bed and breakfast) that was seized from convicted gangland murderer Giovanni "The Butcher" Brusca, Castro is not alone.  "I say I'm not afraid," he said, "but I sleep with three dogs and a gun."  Castro and his agricultural co-op are part of a consortium that is farming thousands of acres of Sicilian land confiscated from Mafiosi and then marketing the fruits of its harvest — pasta, vegetables, wine, olive oil — under a label that proudly declares the products' crime-fighting provenance.  The seizure of Mafia assets has long been an important weapon in Italian authorities' arsenal, but only in the last couple of years has legislation allowed the transfer of property to groups such as Castro's.  It's not a big business yet, but the Libera consortium, the umbrella of 800 anti-Mafia organizations, including Castro's co-op, says the project is attracting notice from followers of the Slow Food movement and similar boutique foodies. Libera products can be found on the shelves of one of Italy's major supermarket chains.  More important is the symbolism: Turning the land against its onetime owners shows the possibility of breaking the Cosa Nostra's hold on at least one aspect of its considerable economic power, advocates say. The act is both redemptive and cathartic, bringing life and bounty from a land stalked by gruesome death and terror.  Castro's co-op — named after Placido Rizotto, a union activist killed in 1948, presumably by gangsters — is housed, appropriately, in the police station of this small town about 15 miles southwest of Palermo. The co-op chalked up about half a million dollars in sales last year, when it produced more than two tons of pasta; so far this year, it has corked 13,000 bottles of white wine.  When they started out, Castro and his fellow agronomists met resistance and chilly stares from residents of the Sicilian towns that were once the dominion of assorted dons. It was difficult to recruit workers for the land, Castro recalled. But now laborers seek him out, he said.  Castro, 31, studied in Florence but was always intent on returning to his native Sicily. He hated the fact that, everywhere he went, his home's name was associated with the Mafia.  These days, he traverses the island's sharp, golden valleys and lush green hilltops in a beat-up blue Fiat Uno, clocking more than 2,000 miles some months.  Down one rutted dirt road, in a sun-parched 15-acre field just outside the town of Corleone, Castro and his hired hands are grafting sprigs of the well-regarded Nero d'Avola red grape to vines that have gone unworked for two years. (The combination makes a more resistant, higher-quality grape, Castro explained.) This patch belonged to a nephew of Salvatore "The Beast" Riina, notorious "boss of bosses" for years until his arrest in 1993.  One of the farmhands said he was not afraid to till such blood-steeped soil, though he would give only his first name, Antonio, and Castro later confided the man's nephew quit out of fear.  "We are here to sweat," said Antonio, 54, pausing to chat and leaning on his hoe. "If we don't work it, someone else will."  A few miles away, the co-op is raising grain, lentils and chickpeas on a 150-acre farm confiscated from Riina. Durum wheat is milled into semolina and hauled to a pasta maker in Corleone, the town made famous by author Mario Puzo in "The Godfather."  At the shop's entryway, a poster painted by schoolchildren takes up the Libera spirit: "Where there were bad plants from the Mafia, now there are grains of freedom. Free pasta for free people."  Corleone and seven other towns in the area have agreed to participate in the land-confiscation project and help the agricultural co-ops with equipment, housing and verbal support, no small thing in this still-suspicious region.  Up the road, the stone villa that once belonged to Brusca sits above a breathtaking valley covered in yellow and lavender wildflowers and freshly planted cherry and plum trees. Cows can be heard mooing in the distance, as hawks fly overhead. The initials of the Brusca family still hang in wrought iron above the heavy wooden door of the main house.  With about a quarter of a million dollars from the European Union, Castro and his co-op have renovated part of the building and installed a restaurant, though they are awaiting permits to open it to the public. With more refurbishing, they plan a bed and breakfast.  The Bruscas were the biggest crime clan in San Giuseppe Jato. Giovanni Brusca, who owned the villa, was arrested in 1996 and eventually confessed to dozens of killings, including one in which he had the 11-year-old son of a rival dissolved in acid.  The boy's picture decorates the label of a fruity white wine that is being produced by another anti-Mafia co-op, Tempio del Monte Jato (Temple of Mt. Jato), which has also opened a restaurant for weekend patrons.  Giuseppe Randazzo, who runs the place, said he's not convinced that the work of a few farmers, chefs and vintners is going to make much difference in challenging the "very entrenched" Mafia.  Castro and the president of his co-op, Gianluca Faraone, think they are safe, for now. The Mafia has turned its sights away from agriculture and to more lucrative businesses such as construction, they noted.  "The Mafia is not interested in confrontations right now, and to attack a group of agronomists would be a major confrontation," the 30-year-old Faraone said.  Maybe. But a few weeks after The Times visited, arsonists burned 25 acres of wheat on confiscated land that Faraone's co-op was farming. The fires were set just as the co-op began celebrating the harvest.

      Jul. 11--CHICAGO -- It is, as the King of Siam famously declared, a puzzlement.  After lots of early-summer discussions with Chicago-area real estate agents, it's hard to know what to make of the marketplace. Just about the only consistency we encountered: Nobody says business is bad.   Previous reports from the trenches have hummed a familiar theme since the Tribune began this series of occasional stories in March 2003. Real estate agents (that is, those who had the time to return calls) almost inevitably told us: It's busy, busy, busy. Or even: It's a madhouse out there.   Not even the threat of war fazed Chicago-area home buyers, who swam toward sales contracts like salmon fighting their way up the Columbia River, apparently drawn by the siren song of low interest rates.   But current readings of the marketplace are a little of everything. Some quarters continue to be in the throes of realty hysteria, with multiple offers a fact of life and some houses selling within hours of being listed. Others say business is calmer, and they're starting to see price reductions, a phenomenon that's been absent for a couple of years.   Agents say that "move-up" properties and homes in the upper brackets are sitting, sitting, sitting -- except for the agents who say they're selling normally, thank you. Agents say buyers are cowed by potential volatility of interest rates; others say they're not concerned at all.   In some areas, investors who hope to snag a bargain, fix it up and resell for a profit are regarded as a major factor in driving up prices; in others, the speculators have practically disappeared, agents say.   Some areas have almost too many houses on the market; there's a dearth in others. Buyers want fixer-uppers, they say; buyers don't want fixer-uppers, they also say.   Here are a few snapshots of local markets, as seen by real estate agents:   CHICAGO NORTHWEST SIDE   Sally M. Haynes, ERA ReaLife   "If it's priced from $230,000 to $260,000 -- really, all the way up to $300,000 -- it's swept up literally overnight in Edison Park, Portage Park and Norwood Park. Our average sale price is quickly creeping up to about $325,000, and last year the average was $262,000.   "But what's being bought and what's being asked are two different things. Some sellers are convinced that they can get a lot more than what their neighbors sold for a few years ago, and that's not always the case. For one thing, what people are looking for has changed. Nine years ago, when I started in the business, it was large living rooms, then it went to big kitchens and lots of closets. Now it's more than one bathroom, a first-floor family room, and an outdoor entertaining space, a deck or patio.   "What's driving the prices is that we have a captive audience of city workers who can't leave Chicago. I've been working with a police officer and his wife for four months, and they're looking in the $250,000 range. We've written offers on five houses. The least competition we've had is six offers on one house. Another house had more than 50 bids.   "The higher end here is becoming the $450,000 to $500,000 range, and that's influenced by city workers, too, who are buying those houses and adding second stories. But I'm starting to see prices level off there, probably because of interest rates, and we're starting to see price reductions there for the first time in a couple of years."   NORTH SIDE   Ashley Carter, Realty Executives City   "It's been a generally strong market. Market times are reasonable now, but it's hard to put a number on it. I'd say houses sell within reasonable time frames, 75 days or less, but you have to price it right.   "I hear anecdotally about rates going up and their effect on the market, but I haven't seen them really affecting anybody's ability to buy lately. They did affect things a few months ago, when they were starting to rise. It was directly affecting how much people could borrow.   "There's interest in two-flats, from people who have purchased before and are looking to make an investment over the longer term. There's a good number of those properties for sale out there because the rental market has been down, in general, and the owners are ready to sell.   "First-time buyers aren't seriously looking at properties that need work. Their attitude seems to be, let's move in, we can have our cookout the same weekend because there's nothing else we need to do.   "You do hear about multiple offers, but not on the homes that have been on the market for three days. I'm seeing multiple offers on homes that have been on the market for 45 days. It's the luck of the draw."   Source: Chicago Tribune Publication date: 2004-07-11

      July 26 (Bloomberg) -- Is a U.S. residential housing bubble a fact or strange fiction? There are two schools of thought on the subject. Either speculation is rampant due to low mortgage rates and home prices are poised for a decline, or demand is at an unprecedented level and prices will rise unabated by ``measured'' rate increases by the Federal Reserve and inflationary pressures. In either case, it's wise to be more careful when buying residential real estate now as prices continue to climb in the largest markets. Ian Morris, chief U.S. economist for HSBC Securities USA, whose parent company is HSBC Holdings Plc -- Europe's biggest bank by market value and the holder of more than $1 trillion in assets -- is one of those who say a bubble is looming in the U.S. residential market. ``The bubble psychology has manifested itself in very rich valuations,'' Morris says. ``House prices relative to income, rent, replacement-cost and home equity have set new highs. Twenty states that account for half of the population look shaky.'' Bullish on Bubble Morris supported his argument in a recent HSBC study that examined valuations of home prices relative to rents, income and consumer debt. His general conclusion was that U.S. housing prices were ``bubbly and 10 percent to 20 percent too high.'' Possibly exacerbating Morris's bubble scenario is the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's stated policy of ``measured'' increases in short-term interest rates. The Fed's move will probably ``cause a reassessment of likely future house-price risks and its associated debt, thereby triggering housing's fall,'' Morris says. Particularly telling, in Morris's view, is the housing price- to-rent ratio (P/R), which he says is an indicator of home overpricing. ``The P/R ratios for New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Philadelphia have surpassed the peak of the late 1980s bubble, and suggest prices could be roughly 25 percent too high compared to current rents,'' Morris says, adding that Chicago and Detroit also look expensive to him, while Dallas and Houston look ``comfortably priced.'' Situation Normal While Morris's observations concur with leading economists like Robert Shiller, the Yale University academic and author of ``Irrational Exuberance,'' real estate analysts and the Fed say he's off track. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, for one, has repeatedly discounted the existence of a housing bubble. A report titled ``Are Home Prices the Next `Bubble'?'' by Jonathan McCarthy and Richard Peach of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, disputes the pro-bubble camp. The New York Fed's report finds ``little basis for such concerns. The marked upturn in home prices is largely attributable to strong market fundamentals: Home prices have essentially moved in line with increases in family income and declines in nominal mortgage interest rates.'' McCarthy says strong demand is driving prices on both U.S. coasts where there are building restrictions and a shortage of available land for building. ``Here in New York, there's not much land left and there are various regulations, so it's not like they're going to be building a lot of condos,'' McCarthy says. Being Cautious Even within the Fed system, though, there's some room for discussion on whether housing prices are peaking. A new study by Morris Davis, a Federal Reserve economist, and Jonathan Heathcote, a Georgetown University economics professor, focuses more on the increase in land prices over the past five years. Davis and Heathcote concluded that U.S. land prices may post a ``cumulative decline of 6.3 percent'' over the next three years with nominal growth in home prices at 2.6 percent over that period. ``This would be the smallest three-year nominal increase for home prices on record,'' the authors say. The debate on whether home prices will rise or fall is largely academic because the Fed's interest-rate increase may only spur potential homeowners into a frenzy to take advantage of the lowest mortgage rates in a generation. In a possible nod to that view, Freddie Mac, the second-biggest buyer of home loans, predicted U.S. sales of new and existing homes will total 7.3 million this year, beating last year's record of 7.19 million. Speculative Frenzy? Sales and prices of existing homes hit record highs in June, the National Association of Realtors said in Washington today. Sales of previously owned homes unexpectedly increased 2.1 percent from a 6.81 million-unit rate in May, the trade association said. Existing home sales were forecast to fall to a 6.65 million annual rate in June, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The median selling price rose to a record $191,800. If the U.S. housing boom is coming to an end, buyers certainly aren't acting like the party's over. ``People are buying without money down and using interest-only loans,'' says George Marotta, a research fellow and former financial planner at the Hoover Institution in Palo Alto, California. ``I think we're coming close to the end'' of the housing boom, he says. ``It's not a good time to buy. I hope I'm wrong, but it looks like the stock market bubble.'' Like many in the bubble school, Marotta is concerned about high household debt levels, which he calls ``the biggest bubble of all.'' Marotta says it's troubling that while personal debt has risen, average U.S. home equity has ``dwindled to 57 percent, compared with 85 percent a half-century ago.'' Watch for Overpricing Randy Johnson, a mortgage broker for Independence Mortgage Company in Newport Beach, California, says it pays to watch for speculation and overpricing in your market if you are buying now. ``I would put an appraisal contingency in every offer and get an appraiser I trust,'' Johnson says, advising the use of the lender's appraiser instead of the agent's to ensure that you're not overpaying for a home. ``What happens in this stage of the cycle is the sub-standard properties come on the market under the `if I can get that much for it, I'll sell it' philosophy,'' Johnson says. ``I have seen people putting these houses into escrow and finding out upon inspection that they need to do a lot more work than they thought.'' ``I think that there really are people who are buying property on speculation that they can quickly resell at a huge profit,'' Johnson says. ``You can't build a market on speculators selling to the next wave of speculators.'' Just as all real-estate pricing is local, so should your focus be on your long-term financial goals and debt level. Stop worrying about whether your market is frothy and check if you're saving enough for emergencies, retirement and college. That's the best way to avoid another, more personally damaging kind of financial bomb. To contact the writer of this column: John F. Wasik in Chicago at jwasik@bloomberg.net.

      Cable companies, which have been weighed down for years by heavy investments and sagging subscriber growth, are starting to turn the corner. But as they do, they are meeting formidable foes in emboldened phone companies.   urlLink Comcast , the nation's biggest cable operator, said yesterday that it earned $262 million in the second quarter, after losing $22 million in the same period last year, thanks to an increase in the number of customers signing up for digital video services and an increase in advertising revenue. Comcast's revenues rose 10.2 percent, to $5.1 billion, compared with a year earlier.  Comcast, which is based in Philadelphia, also said it would double its share buyback program to $2 billion. The company is trying to jump-start its stock, which has sagged since a bid for the  urlLink Walt Disney Company  failed earlier this year.  Sales at Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable provider, increased 10 percent, to $2.1 billion, partly driven by a 25 percent gain in revenues from high-speed data services and digital video services. However,  urlLink Time Warner , the cable company's parent, said total company profits slipped 27 percent in the quarter from the period last year.  Comcast's acquisition of AT&amp;T's cable service less than two years ago vaulted it to the top of the industry. With more than 21 million television, Internet and phone subscribers, Comcast is about twice as large as Time Warner Cable.  Shares of both companies fell yesterday because of concerns that the regional Bell carriers are chipping away at the cable industry's command of the high-speed Internet market and because cable operators do not have a significant business selling phone services.  Comcast shares fell $1.18, or 4.1 percent, to close at $27.56 yesterday. Time Warner's shares dipped 1.5 percent, or 26 cents, to $16.65. Shares in  urlLink Cablevision  and other cable providers also slipped. In recent months, the regional Bells have teamed up with satellite providers to offer television services along with their telephone and broadband lines. Though the cable industry still controls the majority of residential broadband connections, the Bells are now adding more new customers per month. And phone companies like  urlLink Verizon  and SBC, which own mobile phone carriers, can offer bundled plans that include wireless services, which presents an advantage over cable providers.  "I think there are a lot of challenges to keep growing next year for Comcast," said Alan Bezoza, who covers the cable industry for Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. "At the end of the day, they need to have a bundle that includes voice."   Comcast currently sells phone service over traditional lines, but that business is very limited. Its revenues for phone services fell 13.8 percent, to $177 million, and the number of subscribers declined 10.4 percent, to 1.2 million. Comcast is planning to introduce an Internet phone service to compete with the regional Bells, but not for at least another year.  Time Warner Cable says it is on track to introduce Internet phone services in all its 31 markets by the end of the year, but did not provide company-wide subscriber figures. Despite the challenges, Comcast, with more than six million broadband customers, is still the largest broadband provider in the country.  Comcast and Time Warner Cable are starting to reap the benefits from their spending and building spree started in the 1990's. The cable industry spent about $85 billion combined to upgrade its networks so they could offer not only broadband Internet connections and telephone service, but also high-definition television and video-on-demand services.  That construction is largely complete, so the companies have been introducing new products and increasing their marketing efforts to recoup their investments. Comcast added 1.1 million new digital television customers in the last quarter, but also lost 96,000 basic cable subscribers. The digital television service costs more per month than basic cable television, so the increase in digital subscribers helped raise the company's revenues and the average amount customers paid per month.  The company's operating margins have returned to levels before it bought AT&amp;T's cable unit, a sign it has absorbed the costs integrating the two companies.

      7/26/2004 9:19:53 AM By Steve Gelsi 9:19 AM ET Jul 26, 2004  NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Google increased the size of its IPO by about $1.1 billion Monday, with the Internet search firm eyeing a price range of $108 to $135 per share for 24.64 million shares.  Google also disclosed that it plans to trade its shares on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "GOOG."  The Mountain View, Calif.-based company will raise up to $3.3 billion in the IPO. Based on the middle point of the estimated price range, Google will raise $2.99 billion.  Including shares held back to cover underwriters' overallotments, Google could raise up to $3.8 billion in the IPO -- well above the $2.7 billion maximum estimate in earlier filings. The price range signals strong interest in the profitable Internet search firm's IPO. The filing of an estimated range often marks the start of an IPO road show, when prospective companies meet with investors.  Morgan Stanley and CS First Boston are lead underwriters on the Google deal.

      The amount spent on advertising on the Internet is set to surpass that spent on on commercial radio within three years, according to new research  The Internet advertising market in the UK amassed an estimated Â£350 million in 2003, which according to industry trade group, the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) UK, puts the industry on track to surpass the commercial radio market withinin 3 years.    The IAB's UK annual report revealed that advertising revenues surged 80 percent year-on-year, boosted by the demand for corporate-sponsored search listings and a surge in new users.  The growth figure is higher than the group's estimate published in earlier in the year when it said UK online advertising market would grow at around 50 per cent in 2003, the reuters news agency reports.  The IAB UK forecast online advertising revenues are expected to Â£600 million by 2007, exceeding those expected by the commercial radio market.   22 July 2004     ......CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE......

      July 19, 2004 Microsoft's Online Unit Shows Signs of Life By SAUL HANSELL   t an October 2002 gala to introduce Microsoft's MSN 8 Internet service, Bill Gates showed a video of himself wearing a butterfly costume and handing out software for the service.   His point was that after seven years of floundering in the Internet access market, Microsoft would do whatever it took to beat its longtime rival America Online. That included pouring $500 million into MSN to match AOL's most popular features and another $300 million into marketing, featuring MSN's butterfly mascot and a concert highlighted by rocker Lenny Kravitz singing "Fly Away."  But all that flew away was the better part of a billion dollars. Microsoft's share of the Internet access market has declined steadily since.  In the years since the start of what was first called the Microsoft Network, Mr. Gates has tried dozens of different business models, from Internet access to Web sites to monthly software subscriptions. They all had one thing in common: they lost money.  Over the last year, however, MSN has finally started to see some profits. The unit began making money last fall and is expected to post an operating profit of about $200 million for the fiscal year that ended June 30, compared with a loss of about $531 million last year.  The reason has little to do with any of Microsoft's more ambitious Internet strategies. Instead, it was one of the businesses that it had put on the back burner - Internet advertising - that really started to take off.   Even without a lot of new investment, MSN's Web site has long been the third most popular destination on the Internet, bringing together its Hotmail e-mail service, the MSNBC news operation and a variety of other channels. Recently, it has worked to repair a frayed relationship with Madison Avenue, putting the company in a good position to gain as the ad market rebounded. Over the last year, MSN has ranked second in online advertising revenue, behind Yahoo and ahead of the longtime leader AOL, a unit of Time Warner.  Mary Meeker, the Morgan Stanley Internet analyst, said that MSN's revival was an indicator of the company's trademark doggedness.   "They began their attack on AOL 10 years ago," she said. "Since then they have lost billions, and now they are making money. It gives me a real sense of just how patient they are." Now basking in its newfound profitability, MSN is again on the offensive, competing with Yahoo, the Internet portal, even more than with AOL. It has a three-prong strategy: continue to cash in on the advertising market, sell software services for people who have broadband Internet access from cable or phone companies, and build a better Web search engine. MSN, which uses Yahoo's search technology, is trying to develop search technology to take on Google. It hopes to introduce that technology by the end of the year.   As investors consider Google's public stock offering, some worry that Microsoft will be able to squeeze out the plucky search company just as it pushed aside Netscape in the Internet browser market. After all, it plans to include links to its new search service on the Windows desktop and in many other products and services.   Yet that same considerable Windows advantage led many observers to predict that Microsoft would cause more trouble than it actually did for AOL and Yahoo. It turned out that most Internet users were willing to skip past the default services offered by Windows in favor of brands they preferred.   "There was a concern that Microsoft would always win because they owned the desktop," said David Card, the research director of Jupiter Research. "If the desktop is so important, then Microsoft should have beaten AOL, but they didn't."  One drag on MSN over the years, said several people who worked there, is that Microsoft has been conflicted about whether to treat the Internet as a media business or a form of software. It is not a simple either-or proposition because so much of the Internet is a hybrid - free software paid for by advertising.   "One thing that amazed me is that the organization changed annually," said Merrill Brown, the former editor in chief of MSNBC. "They seize upon a good idea, and throw lots of resources at it until it's time to move to the next idea or acquisition."   Microsoft certainly has had some successes on the Internet, including Hotmail, MSNBC (a joint venture with General Electric), the Slate opinion journal and Expedia, the online travel agency it sold to InterActiveCorp.   But there have been at least as many failures, ranging from Mungo Park, an adventure travel site, to the CarPoint automobile buying service, to the controversial Hailstorm system for connecting information from different Web sites.  But Microsoft's biggest online failure has been its Internet access business. It lost several billion dollars over the years by paying people $400 rebates to sign three-year contracts for MSN dial-up accounts, according to Internet industry executives. Those customers have quit the service in droves as their commitments expire.   By contrast, AOL's Internet access business has been hugely profitable, even amid turmoil from its merger with Time Warner and the decline in the dial-up, or narrowband, market.   "We said that narrowband is like the buggy whip business," said David Cole, the Microsoft senior vice president in charge of MSN. "We could try to be the best buggy whip maker, but that's not very aspirational. It's hard to get people rallied around that."  The broadband market, however, has proved exasperating for dial-up providers like MSN, AOL and Earthlink, all of which wanted to buy high-speed connections wholesale and market them to consumers.  After accounting for the customer acquisition costs, the costs paid to telephone companies and the support costs, Mr. Cole said, "there is nothing left over."   Microsoft has invested $6 billion in Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, but that has not led to an arrangement to distribute MSN services to Comcast customers. Comcast, in fact, edged out Microsoft this year to become the nation's second-largest Internet provider, with 10 percent of the Internet access market, according to Solomon Research.  Microsoft's share of that market has fallen from a peak of 13 percent in 2002 to 8 percent today. (AOL's share fell to 24 percent from 29 percent in the last two years.) Microsoft claims a total of eight million subscribers to its various MSN services, of which about five million are Internet access customers, according to ComScore Media Metrix, an Internet ratings company.   Now, the company hopes to sell extra services to people who buy broadband service from their local telephone or cable companies. For $5.95 a month, it offers MSN Plus, which mainly expands e-mail services. MSN Premium, for $9.95 a month, adds firewall and virus software, and access to some proprietary content, most notably Webcasts of Major League Baseball games. Microsoft paid a reported $40 million over two years for the baseball rights.  So far, that market has not taken off. Microsoft will not say how many broadband add-on subscriptions it has sold, admitting only that the vast bulk of its users come from deals it has struck with Verizon and Qwest to include MSN software as part of those company's basic broadband services.   Microsoft is also developing more services, including some for small businesses, and a new music download offering meant to compete with Apple's iTunes.   But it is MSN's advertising business that is really starting to pay off.   The company had a reputation on Madison Avenue of being unresponsive and forcing advertisers to use its own proprietary formats. But in late 2001, it hired an experienced magazine executive, Joanne Bradford, to run its advertising sales staff and to reach out to agencies. It also moved to embrace the industry's standard ad formats. As marketers discovered ways to use more interactive ads, MSN was one of the few sites that could deliver a mass audience.  Still, MSN's audience appears to be more transient than those of its rivals. According to ComScore Media Metrix, 111 million people visited some part of MSN at least once in May. That is just slightly behind Yahoo, which had 113 million visitors and Time Warner (including America Online), which had 112 million. But MSN's visitors spent 147 minutes, on average, looking at MSN pages in the month, far less than the 260 minutes that users spent on Yahoo or the 340 minutes they devoted to Time Warner sites.  Yusuf Mehdi, a vice president for MSN, concedes that the company needs to find a way to engage its audience more.   "We want to have the sort of evangelical feedback that people have for the iPod or the TiVo," Mr. Mehdi said. "I want people to say, 'I love MSN.' "   MSN hopes one way to achieve that is to customize its service to the interests of each user. For example, it has introduced trial versions of an automated news service that displays headlines for articles based on the topics that users have shown interest in.  Another part of Microsoft's Internet strategy is to combine Web searches with an improved application that lets users find documents and e-mail messages on personal computers. The enhanced search function will be a feature of the next major version of Windows, scheduled for 2006, but Mr. Mehdi said that MSN would make a desktop computer search feature available much sooner, probably as part of the free downloadable toolbar that it introduced earlier this year. And last week Microsoft bought Lookout, a tiny software company, to help with its desktop search effort.  But even with this new focus on searches, Danny Sullivan, the editor of Search Engine Watch, said that Microsoft will have a tough time catching up with Google. "To shift market share, Google has to get bad and they have to get good," he said. "People will not go to Microsoft, even if Microsoft is better than Google - if Google is good enough."  Mr. Mehdi said that Microsoft was betting that none of today's search engines are quite good enough to hold users and that Microsoft's strengths will give it a significant advantage as the Internet evolves.   "Search is not done until you can give users the answer they want instead of a list of 1,000 Web sites," Mr. Mehdi said. "That's a big, tough software problem. And we said, thank goodness we're software guys."    Copyright 2004 The New York Times Company      ......CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE......

      According to an April 2004 survey published by the e-tailing group, the vast majority of Internet retailers rank customer acquisition and customer retention as their most important marketing strategies, followed closely by converting online browsers into buyers. Another 86% of online merchants rate the need to drive traffic to their Web site as an important priority as well. Not surprisingly, the e-tailing group has found that online retailers are increasingly shifting their marketing dollars to the Internet, due in part to the fact that online marketing is easy to test and refine. Furthermore, online marketing continues to be less expensive than most offline advertising channels.  www.eMarketer.com

      Contact: Tom Genaro 908-580-1959  The Coalition has vented it's displeasure with A&E and Victoria Gotti for the "Growing up Gotti" TV reality show.  Executive Director, Dr. Emanuele Alfano, stated, “It’s disparaging to note the A&E recent bent toward assaulting the Italian American Community with defamatory programming.  First was the Medici series, which was flavored with a Sopranosesque theme, and now a weekly program on the trials and tribulations of a Mafia daughter. Victoria Gotti does not represent Italian American women any more than Heidi Fleiss represents women of her community, but both are cashing in on their notoriety. Each has no concern of further tarnishing their personae as long as the linings of their pockets are thickened with dirty money."   Dr. Alfano went on to state that the media has fed the public's appetite for the mob genre by offering vowel ending surname characters who are brutal and immoral.  Unfortunately, this frenzied feeding has further deepened the prevailing myth of synonymy between Italianita and criminality. As the more astute critics have noted, Italian Americans are the last easy target upon which to hurl defamation without fear of retaliation.  However, let it be known by all detractors that that day has ended and a new and determined united coalition of Italian American Organizations will rise against any new attempts to diminish our identity as honorable American citizens.  Further statements accused A&E and of ill will towards Italian American women by continuing to portray them other than the Patricia Russos, the Carli Fiorinas and the Laura Savinis. The listing of notable Italian American women is extensive, but the lower end of that listing seems to be preferred over the well educated sophisticated women that the Italian American Community is indeed proud of.   Dr. Alfano urged both A&E and Victoria Gotti to recognize the damage which will be incurred if the "Victoria Gotti Show" is allowed to spew out weekly, a distorted image of the true Italian American woman. “What Ms. Gotti does not understand is that the audience will be laughing at her and certainly not with her”, said Dr. Alfano.  He ended by imploring A&E to withdraw the program as an act of decency.

      NEW YORK 24/7 Real Media yesterday reported a 61 percent revenue rise on net income of $1.5 million in the second quarter versus the year-ago period.   The online advertising and technology company recorded Q2 revenue of $19.6 million, up from $12.2 million in the same period last year.   Second-quarter net income was $1.5 million, or 4 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $4.4 million, or 31 cents per share in Q2 2003. The net-income figure includes a gain of $2.9 million from a legal settlement with chinadotcom corp.   The New York-based company said it expects Q3 revenue of $19.5-20.5 million, noting that the company traditionally shows little growth during the period as a result of seasonality factors. Third-quarter diluted pro forma operating income, likely to be affected by the $600,000-750,000 onetime costs associated with the company's Sarbanes-Oxley compliance efforts, is forecasted to be 0-1 cent per share.   For the full year, 24/7 projected revenue of $80-82 million and pro forma earnings of 4-7 cents per share.   24/7 shares (TFSM) were trading on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market today at $2.78, down 24 cents or 8 percent.   --Ann M. Mack

      After hearing the buzz about behavioral targeting, it seemed to make sense to put that term into perspective, writes Poindexter Systems' Joe Zawadzki. Behavioral marketing, despite its five-year lifespan, had really just gotten off the  ground in terms of product evolution at a time when the space -- particularly online marketing and technology startups -- was contracting. Now, as companies (re)turn to data-driven marketing, some key techniques and principles should be incorporated at the start of this renaissance to ensure solid results and sustainable growth. To begin with, companies should look to their roots. Companies with the most success in  online behavioral marketing are those that leverage their offline expertise in this area. Marketers long have relied on audience segmentation and clustering to find the right segments for their varied messages.

      Forbes.com is experimenting with an ad placement technique from Vibrant Media in San Francisco that puts links to advertisers' sites directly into the text of stories. Some publishers worry the strategy might erode the traditional separation between journalistic content and advertising. But Jim Spanfeller, president and chief executive at Forbes.com, said "We want to be trailblazers, whether from an advertising standpoint or an editorial standpoint" and added that the practice will end if readers express confusion or disapproval.
