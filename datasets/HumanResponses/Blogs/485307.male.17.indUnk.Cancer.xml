      well.. sometimes a lil chat is needed along with a bit of honestly to relieve a lot of stress huh.&nbsp; soo jung-ee.. i never really can seem to hold anything against you, but maybe because i think you speak honestly in return to me.. do you?&nbsp; iono.. it helps. daidai's party was yesterday.. the beginning was pretty boring.. just played a ton of gamecube/mahjong/texas he, earlier on i played hold em with what.. $4 and i ended up with 3.15.. so i quit for a while and went to teach yuki and heather how to play mahjong.&nbsp; im so proud of my pupil heather for winning 7 out of 9 games of mahjong!&nbsp; holy crap dude.. she should be a professional gambler or something, she owns at hold em also.&nbsp; and yuki.. you did well too :) haha.&nbsp; anyways.. so once ryan and some of the other regular gamblers came, ALL THEY DID was play poker.&nbsp; like.. its her party.. all they do is play poker at her house.&nbsp; after hearing some stuff.. its kinda sad what they did.&nbsp; kinda makes me pissed off too. so.. after a while we went to the rec center in 5 canyons and played tennis/bball.. some ppl played dueces.. and whaddya know,  ryan  wanted to friggen go back and get chips so they could gamble again.. wtf?&nbsp; anyways.. so after spending a few hours at the rec center we went back to daidais house(oh yeah.. i brought 2 pizzas for food, and there were like 10 pizzas altogether there.. oops)&nbsp;.. well, me and bo stayed a lil longer to play 1on1 tennis at the rec center, and i was winning 4-2 before bo got pissed off cuz he couldnt see cuz it was too dark, and he chucked his racket hella hard at the ground.. almost hard enough to make it bounce over the fence.. haha.&nbsp; so.. yeah, we got back.. and there most of the guys are gambling again, and jae/stephen were like the only guys who didnt gamble.. they were playing monkey ball and got hella into it.&nbsp; haha like omgwtfholyshit.&nbsp; hella people were into it also.. haha, and so i got back into hold em with another $2 buy in.. stopped for a while when i was at $2.10.. played monkey ball in place of stephen/jaeman(they were at the point where they were trying to beat level 7 of extreme level for like half an hour), and i beat jaemans high score in my first continue.. :)&nbsp; jaeman and stephen were like "DUDE U WILL NEVER CATCH UP TO US.&nbsp; OUR SKILL LEVEL IS LIKE *holds hand up above head* THAT HIGH!"&nbsp; haha.. so i pretty much got that far and yeah.. but by that point everyones interest seemed to just have faded from the game.. prolly just cuz i was playing or something.. but doesnt matter, i managed to get to  level 9  by my third try around.&nbsp; damn.. some intense gaming.&nbsp; haha..&nbsp; anyways, so after i did that, i went back to gambling with me $2.10.. played three hands and tripled my stash to $6.60.. :)&nbsp; that was it for the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;i wanted to take a picture of my intimidating chip pile.. haha.&nbsp; &nbsp; all about  urlLink pokerroom.com  haha..&nbsp; anyways, when i decide to host a poker night, its gonna be  tournament  and not a damn cap.&nbsp; .. so.. after that, most of the guys left and only me, brad, stephen, and alvin were left with the girls, christa, yuki, alex, heather, daidai, and natalie.&nbsp; we just talked for hellaaaa long.. me/alv/stephen/brad stayed there till like 3:30 till we finally decided to let the girls have their girl talk.&nbsp; man.. that was some pretty crazy stuff..&nbsp; raping guys, killing zombies, holding bars, smoking opium, girls losing their virginity.&nbsp; all fair game in that convo.&nbsp; hahaha... it was pretty good having that chat.&nbsp; so anyways.. stephen spent the night at my house cuz of unexpected circumstances, and thats about it.&nbsp; hit the sack around 4.

      like i said before, no one i care about will ever understand how much i actually do.&nbsp; also, in the unlikely&nbsp;case they do,&nbsp;never will they be able to prove to me that they care in return. .. what did i think today?&nbsp; all of you are fuckin' tards.

      i want my friends back.. (just a random thought that came across my mind, to be interpreted freely amongst readers) ... ive noticed that.. well, im sure everyone has noticed that i havent been posting lately, and heres my rational.. whenever i post, its usually because im either happy or sad, or both.  usually, most of the time its sad.  its a good thing that im not posting as much.. in a way.  ive been a lot more tranquil in the past few weeks compared to the last few years.  its good.

      whoops, i skipped my birthday.. haha.  yeah.. for those readers who dont know, june 30th was my birthday.  wooo 17 now.. -_-; .. man.. sorry to say people, but being depressed is part of me.  its how i live.  if i wasnt.. so many things would be different for the better or for the way worse.  i'd just like to add that.. im a coward too.  to be truthful i was reading some archives out of boredom and well.. i really miss frosh year.  frosh summer, to be exact.. that was great.  cant repeat the past.. of course you  cant ..  i should slap myself for stuff thats been going on lately.  outta my mind, i tell you.. outta my mind..

      wow, i havent updated in the longest time.  crazy.  even more than a week.. i guess just cuz theres not much significant stuff to say, which is good!  summer school is over, had korean bbq with leona and ppls, ate some crazy subs that stan made(im gonna die soon), parents are back home, watched  the village  with ppls(ehh, it was okay, i think it had REALLY bad acting), made some new friends(sorta ;D), got FT, got readdicted to D2.  thats my whole last week in a nutshell.  ive been playing sooo many games lately, cuz thats all there is to do.  oh, and sleeping at 5am and waking up around 1pm.  goodness.  somebody stop me.  hahahahahahahahhhahahahahahaahhahahaahahahaahahhahahah.  im tired.
