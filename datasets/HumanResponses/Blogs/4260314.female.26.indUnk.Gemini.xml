      Friday, at last! Yes, I am one of the every working person who is happy when Friday roles around. Nothing creative about that.  I am SO looking forward to the weekend! Parties, parties, parties! There is nothing I enjoy more then going to parties, and I have three this weekend. joy!! ('.')  One of my closest friends has moved back into town--exciting! This makes up for the fact that I'm losing my bf on Sunday, as he's leaving for school. I am interested in seeing how this long-distance relationship goes..  I had one long distance relationship in college... I met a guy the end of my junior year, and dated him through the summer (he lived in my hometown). Right before we left for our respective colleges...he announced that he wanted us to remain "exclusive". I adored him--and was psyched! Things were fine for about 3 months after that... Then one weekend, I drove the 8 hours to see him.. The next morning--he told me he was seeing other people. I smiled my biggest smile, looked him dead in the eye and chirped "ME TOO!!!". (Not true at all...in fact I had REJECTED my on-again/off-again huge college crush/semi-boy friend b/c of my supposed exclusive relationship with this jerk).  Anyway, I got up went to the bathroom, the whole time mentally chanting "Don't express any emotion." Then I grabbed my stuff, thanked him for the visit (which was only 1 day long...) and drove back home.  He called me a few months later "regreting" the incident. By that time I was emotionally stable enough to kindly tell him to fuck off.  Anyway,I hope this relationship has a better outcome!

      BF and I went to a baseball game last night.  V. fun. I am a huge sports fan. BTW, the battle of the wits ended on a good note. He emailed me first (per usual) and things are just fine. We had a good discussion last night about relationships and about ex's. My ex is going to be at a party I'm hosting on Friday (and so will my new bf). I wanted to give him the heads up--not to cause drama, but to dampan any drama that might occur when I awkwardly  introduce them to each other. Bonus points for my bf who talked about the freedom of letting go of your feelings from a past relationship (His ability to "let go" is a sign that he will not become an obsessive stalker). yay!  I IMd with my bro (who also happens to be my best friend) yesterday about "The Gift of Fear". He laughed at me. Which I guess it a good thing....he thinks I need to "relax". I do have a problem of thinking too much--but it's better to be safe than sorry! For now, I will put my fear of being stalked by my bf on the back-burner...and focus on the hear and now/reality of our relationship. Good thing I have my bro to keep me in check.  My upcoming weekend is going to be full of parties! hurrah!! But this is also the last weekend my bf is in town. booo. At least he'll be leaving on an 'up!' note full of social fun!

      I decided to remove my initial post from this site...thinking that maybe it was starting off with too much information, too soon. How can I live up to my initial promises? Is my life really as exciting as I think it is?  Probably not.  Anyway, this will be my "official" day one, first post to the blog (hurrah!)  Day One:  My bf and I are currently in a battle of wits. Or should I say a battle of who is more stubborn than the other? I think he is trying to test me to see when I'll crack and give into my feelings. I think he doesn't know that I rarely crack...and I almost never give into my true feelings. What are emotions anyway? I think too much for that.  Anyway, he usually emails me first thing everyday..following up with subsiquent emails throughout the day. BUT the past two days...nothing. We've talked on the phone (so we aren't officially NOT talking) but the daily email exchange has halted. And for some reason I am not compelled to be the one to start it (maybe because that's always been his job?).  He is leaving my city soon (he only summers in my town--but he's in grad school elsewhere). I don't know which one of us is more freaked out over wether or not long distance will work. .. I guess time will tell, eh?  On a random, but perhaps similar note. I have been reading "The Gift of Fear". This book is freaking me out...could my bf being trying to kill me? Or am I letting the "warning signs" from this book go to my head? I haven't decided yet. If you want to lose sleep, while learning how to deal with an obsessed stalker/maniac, I recommend this book.  For the none of you who did read my post yesterday. Both facts remain true today. I am still HAH (horny as hell) and I am still in a frustatingly sexless relationship with 2 totally different men (1 being my bf, and 1 being my co-worker). sigh.  Alright, back to work!
