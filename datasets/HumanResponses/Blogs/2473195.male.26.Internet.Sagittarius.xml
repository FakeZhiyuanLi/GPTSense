       search:  [horse]   


err, i have a bruise on my stomach because a horse randomly bit me yesterday. i wasn't even doing anything to him.
i was looking for ryan because he's my buddy, but i couldn't find him so i was talking to the other horses. i do that a lot.
anyway, i was standing next to this horse, when he just reached over and bit me. for NO REASON. i think he wanted me to give him food, or something.
 i walked far away from him and pretended that i hadn't almost been eaten by a crazy,  people -eating horse.
that's okay, though. i found ryan soon after, and he expressed his outrage by trying to knock me over with his face.
horses are weird sometimes.

       search  [donkey]    

It was an OK night - a reunion of the old Kiwi crowd who rarely see each other since the heady days of four years ago. It was ex-boyfriend-a-rama too, although it could have been a lot worse - this time there were only two, one of whom was the Donkey.
 
If I may be permitted to go a bit Belle De Jour here (ie. talking about ex-lovers, not 'Rimming: a modern girl's guide'), I'd voiced my concerns to him earlier in the day about the prospect of our impending meeting, specifically that I feared it would end up as it usually does, with the two of us trying to outbest each other on who's got the most fabulous new life. He assured me it wouldn't and that he would be on his best behaviour, and not spend half an hour talking about his new Marc Jacobs scarf or anything like that.
 
And so, for the most part, it was fine. We've always got on incredibly well, and inevitably we spent most of the night huddled together at the bar, backs to the others, talking old times. But there's a certain line you just don't cross, certain things you just don't do, even with an remarkably well-adjusted ex-girlfriend who wouldn't touch you again with a bargepole. And one of those things is telling the ex-girlfriend (of just two short months) that you've met 'The One'. Even if you have (and call me a bitter old cynic, but I seem to recall hearing rather similar words this time two years ago and, well, look how that turned out), basic tact would suggest you probably should keep that particular nugget to yourself for a while.
 
I'd like to stay all Belle De Jour - articulate, poignant, poetic - but the only words that spring to mind here are 'fuck', 'you' and 'you fucking fuck'. I think they do the job.

“Deterrence”
 POTENTIAL SNIPER #1: Hey, John Allen Muhammed got the death penalty.
 POTENTIAL SNIPER #2: Holy shit. I guess we should get rid of our guns and get jobs.
 POTENTIAL SNIPER #1: But I had my heart set on driving around and shooting people randomly.
 POTENTIAL SNIPER #2: Hey, me too, but there’s only one place that ends. I don’t want to die by lethal injection or in the electric chair or whatever. I was willing to do with life imprisonment in solitary, or maybe even an insane asylum, but the federal death penalty—that’s just too much.
 POTENTIAL SNIPER #1: But I want to kill!
 POTENTIAL SNIPER #2: You can’t always get what you want. Now where are those want-ads?

Perhaps it's best for me not to explain the subject of this message, except that the cat didn't seem to notice. Also, it just seemed to be an appropriate metaphor for the day.

       search:  [ meat ]     

And fortunately, no circumstantial nightmares occured. My table manners were  parfait  apart from one blunder. During the main course, I accidentally flung a piece of roast meat across the table in the process of cutting it up. And if that was not bad enough, I did so, whilst in the middle of a conversation with Pretty Boy and his boss, Pot Belly -- an incident which, thankfully, all three of us found incredibly hilarious and had a good laugh about.

       It's been 5+ years since I last worked at the  urlLink Stanford Graphics Lab , so they finally kicked me off their servers. Fair enough.  So I "decided" to move out and get a place of my own. A shiny new virtual machine, with wall-to-wall carpeting and granite countertops. Good stuff.  I'll sleep better knowing that my  urlLink photo collections  can roam free, where the deer and the antelope play.
