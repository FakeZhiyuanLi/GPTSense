        It has been a long time since I last wrote.  I was hoping that I would stay consistent in doing this blog..for me.  I haven't seem to find the time to write anything though and I don't like to do it when Papa B is around so that doesn't give me much chance.  Anyways............... So since I last posted Riley is better and than Lee(oldest boy) caught whatever it is that Riley had, but I believe we are all done with that now!!  I'm in the process of painting the kitchen..I started on Tuesday and took tomorrow on vacation so hopefully I get it all done and still be able to enjoy the long weekend, it is taking longer to paint the kitchen because we have old cupboards and I have decided to paint them to maybe lighten up the kitchen a bit..or atleast I hope!!    The kids are down to there final days of school...yea!!!!  Well hopefully tomorrow I will get on here and write something..just ramblings is all.

      I am home from work today with Riley (that is my daughter), she had the flu yesterday and so I kept her home from school for a day of recoup.  But she is driving me nuts!!!  She is feeling much better today and is following me around the house and constantly talking..which that isn't so abnormal..but since I work full-time I'm not use to having her home alone without the boys and nobody else for her to interact with.  I'm hoping that the hubby gets home from work soon so I can go into work for a bit and just get out of the house..that probably sounds awful..I love her to death..but she just talks constantly..haha!!  Well I should probably try to get some stuff done around her.

      It seems like this week is going to just drag on forever..I don't know if I can take it much more!!  Yeah I'm sure I really can..but ya know it is always fun to be a little dramatic.  It feels like here in the midwest we are finally getting some summer weather..now that summer is almost half over lets throw in some upper 80's just to tease us and next week we will get those wonderful 60's back.  The weather has gotten so strange, usually by now it is 70 in the morning and 90 by noon..not that I am totally complaining because I don't care for the 90's, but it is just not like most years.  Today the oldest Lee is babysitting Brookiecookie for my niece..he has had her since 7:30 this morning (she is almost 3)..so I call him this morning around 10 to see how things are going..well besides him having to get up way early she was being a little wild and it took him 10 minutes to change her diaper..she can be such a stinker!!  He keeps telling me that once he gets paid on friday it will all be worth it..we will see!!  Lastnight it was so peaceful at our house for about an hour..the kids went to the public pool..so hubster and I got to eat dinner alone and talk without any kids interrupting..of course what did we do..sat and watched tv while we ate and hardly talked..I feel like such an old couple!! haha  Well it is back to work for me..computers have been really slow today so I decided to take a break..well from actual work being done on the computer!!

      I can't believe I just typed this whole big entry and now it is gone...dang!!  Saturday the hubster went to a friends to a tattoo party..this lady is totally licensed and she comes to your house and you can invite 6-8 people over and she will do tattoos.  Well I don't really like the hubster's choice but I will live with it since it doesn't show when he has a shirt on.  At the end of July we are having a tattoo party at our house and my 2 sisters, my niece, and I are getting a matching tattoo...it is going to be a small pink rose kind of in memory of my mom because that was her favorite flower.  Not that my mom would love the fact that we are getting a tattoo, but it still will mean something to us.  Yesterday we had a hair party at our house.  My niece and great niece came over and Ashley(niece) dyed Ryan's hair for the 4th of July..if I can figure out how to I will upload a picture on here..it is so cool, then I cut Brookiecookie's hair since she had taken a scissors to it earlier in the morning, and then I dyed the underneath of Ashley's hair blue for the 4th.    Well back to work for me....later!

      I am so tired this week and I can not figure out what is going on.  I just toss and turn and feel like I never get to sleep at all or atleast not until the alarm goes off.  Lastnight I was doing my motherly duties..you know the one where you are suppose to make you child miserable..one boy wanted to sleep at a friends house and the other one wanted to have a friend spend the night at ours.  Of course I'm mean and said no to both of them.  With Tim and I having to get up around 5:30 in the morning and them not going to bed until late and a friend on top of that you know that they are not going to bed early and they will be loud..so nope no go!!   Well I suppose I should try to be productive here at work.

      Well we had Kim and Neal's going away party on saturday night.  I think all that attended had a good time, I know my alcoholic family had a blast!!  My sister and her five kids were all there which was great because we don't always get the five of them together at one time.  So they all played poker and got a little tuned..it just kept the night interesting.  My nephew brought a friend with him and this kid is just like Nick..so scary!!    Sunday I went over to Kim's parents house to say my final goodbye to them and that was so hard.  Her mom had all she could do to not cry and I thought I was doing super until I gave Kim a hug and then we both lost it..I swore I was ok with it until that point.  So, I gave her another big hug, gave Neal a hug, and then I had to leave because I couldn't watch her say goodbye to her parents and her dad told me that we were making him get tears in his eyes.  So hopefully I will hear from her soon, they are taking a week to drive to California and do some sightseeing on the way so I'm sure it won't be until next weekend, but I can't wait to talk to her.  Well I suppose I should get back to work.

      Well this first week of summer vacation for the kids has gone extremely well..not that I didn't think it would..just glad that it did!!   This weekend I am hoping to finish painting the kitchen.  I thought with school out that I would have so much time at night after supper, but that just has not happened.  I really only have this weekend to get it done since my sister will be home next weekend and we are also having Kim's going away party.  My bestest friend in the world is moving to California in a week in a half and it really sucks!! So, not too much happening around here..kids are being good..boys are enjoying sleeping in every day and it is so nice in the morning only having to get one child ready to go to daycare for a change.

      Tomorrow is the last day of school for the kids and I am quite anxious actually..no more getting crabby kids up in the morning.  Lee and Ryan are staying home by themselves this year and Riley is going to go to the YMCA summerdaze program, so her brothers don't kill or vice versa!!    I got 3/4 of the kitchen painted and just have one wall left to do..we are doing the top and bottom different colors so it is taking a bit for the hubs to get motivated to complete that.  I don't know as if anyone has read this blog, but if you do could you tell me if you know how to add a list for other blogs you read.  Have a great one..gotta get back to work!!

      I tell you my boys are in soooooo deep when I get home from work tonight!!!! &nbsp; Earlier Lee calls me at work and asks if they can go swimming...his friends mom will take and pick up...I say NO, so of course he gets all huffy and says fine and hangs up the phone. (let me tell you...boys are just as moody as girls when they don't get there way!)&nbsp; So about 10 minutes later I am standing in my bosses office and I can hear my phone ringing..I knew this because his office is in our office but has doors and none of the other ladies were picking up there phones so you know where I am going with this..pretty soon I hear my cell phone ringing..now no one calls me on my cell phone during work hours so I just know it is him..so I start heading back to my desk and the phone starts ringing..it is LEE!!&nbsp; I informed that if I don't answer my work phone the first time than obviously I am not at my desk which means leave me a message and I will return your call as soon as I can.&nbsp; He asked again if they could go swimming and his mouthy little friend is in the background making all kinds of comments about the weather and such which really pissed me off..so needless to say as much as I want to cream him right now..I let them go..but they are grounded once they get home.&nbsp;  &nbsp; What parent lets there kids go have fun first than grounds them...I guess that would be me..what a loser I am!! &nbsp; The weather here has just been awful..like I should complain summers use to consist of every day being so hot and humid and we get two whole days of and I am complaining.&nbsp; It looks like we are suppose to get some rain this evening which would be good..it will either cool it off a bit or make it more humid. &nbsp; Well the work day is almost over...so I should get the last of my things done before heading home!!

      I tell you...I need to get a torch lit under my buddox!!&nbsp; I have been in the I don't really care about anything once I get home from work and I do absolutely nothing..now the weekends are getting to be just as bad.&nbsp; I think I need the kids to start school again so I have my old routine and know that I must get the laundry done because Lee will not be there during the day to do it and just all those little things that I have normally have to accomplish during the school year when they are busy with homework at night and I have to be there for them.&nbsp; Summer is making me feel like I am not needed except to drive them around.&nbsp; And of course with an almost teenager in the house I am assuming it only gets worse with him not needing me to help him with stuff.&nbsp; Now look I just went and got myself all depressed..bah. &nbsp; Lets try to lighten the mood a bit.&nbsp; On saturday we went shopping..they had Crazy Days at the mall..so we now have new tenny runners for school and then went over and got the boys a total of 11 new shirts and Riley got 2 new shirts for school,&nbsp; so now we just need to work on pants..of course the way my boys wear there shirts so big..they probably don't need any!!&nbsp; Wouldn't they just love me for that one!! haha &nbsp; Well not really too much happening with me because I am too lazy to do anything, but ya know such is life!!&nbsp; Have a great day!

      You know kids are so good at making you feel guilty and especially my daughter Riley!!  Riley is my only child that has ever made me feel guilty about working full time which in turn stuck them at a babysitters all day.  Since she has been in school full time she hasn't complained because than she only went for an hour in the morning and was cool with it, but now this summer she is the only one that is going to daycare and does not like it.  She was begging me lastnight to please take a day off so that she can stay home..she doesn't like the Y...she doesn't like anyone that goes there..and she doesn't like me for going to work!!  Felt kind of shitty after that one..but I just told her that we didn't have much choice if she wanted us to be able to have to money to buy things for them.  That is about all it took!!  Lastnight our neighborhood lost power for about a hour..so darn it we had to eat out! haha  After we finally got our power back and were all getting comfortable for the night watching some tv..than the cable went out..just was not my night.

      I have been trying to get the time to atleast post something but just have not found the time.  Last weekend was so busy with the 4th of July happenings that I did not make it on to post anything.  Friday we went down to the bandshell and watched my dad in the passing of the colors..which I thought was really neat to watch and then we walked home..Tim and the kids went down later to watch the fireworks from there and my dad came over to our house so him and I just sat outside and watched them from here.  Saturday we did fireworks at our house and had a nailpainting party with red, white, and blue polish of course!!  I painted flags on my nails and then got creative with Riley's..they are so cool though.  On the 4th we went to the parade and then down where they were having all of the festivities and got our fill of junk food and later went back down to watch the fireworks.  Riley who is almost 9 watched fireworks outside with all of us for the first time..we would usually just go sit in a parking lot near where they were doing the fireworks and she would sit in the car the whole time..but not this year..she braved it with us.  So needless to say there was not much time for posting.  It has just been nuts at work this week..which of course always happens after a holiday.  The girl that does payroll was on vacation so I got stuck taking care of her job and mine for part of the week.  I use to do payroll and then switched to a different position 3 years ago..now I know why I switched!! haha    My sister was in town this weekend so I had my dad, sister, niece, and great niece over for supper..Riley and I made lasagna and dinner rolls.  She just loves to help me cook when she can and I have learned to have patience.  I am kind of a control freak and want to do things my way..but I have to just chill and let her help because it is wonderful quality time for the two of us.  Hopefully I'll get my stuff together and start posting more regularly..but I guess we will see!!

      Tomorrow is finally Friday and I decided to only work half the day..so I will be off for the long weekend at 11:30am!! YEA!!  Today Riley went with the Y to the Twins game..hopefully they got out of there losing streak for today atleast!!  You know the only thing she was really looking forward to was getting a hot dog and a pop..she is not into sports like her brothers.  I think that Lee is ready for the week of babysitting to be over and that is another reason that I took half a day tomorrow so I can help him out with Miss Brookie.  Tomorrow night all of our towns 4th festivities begin so we are going to go to the concert in the park..mainly because my dad is in the color guard with the American Legion and they are Posting the Colors and leading the event in the Pledge of Allegiance..so that will be cool to watch.  I think Saturday we will just make it a lazy day and then Sunday off to the parade and downtown for some really healthy food and games for the kids.  It is so great having something to do on the weekends..but why does it always have to cost soooo much!!  Ya know I read a bunch of blogs everyday and I would love to be able to add some to my page..but cannot figure out how to do this..can anyone out there help me??  If so that would be great!
