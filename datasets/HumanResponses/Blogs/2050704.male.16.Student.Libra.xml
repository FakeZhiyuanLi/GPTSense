       Something I think that is helpful   Im pretty sure everyone has heard not to drink from the water fountains at school, or anywhere for that matter. Well just to further state that opinion, in biology class we did a bacteria and virus lab on the water fountain, and in less then 24 hours, 91 colonies of "streptobacillus" a.k.a. strept throat grew. By tomorrow, there should be 500 colonies or more. So the next time you go to drink from the water fountain think to yourself "This is full of viruses. Lets spend money on bottled water instead and stay healthy"   Just something I found somewhat interesting.

       A Guide To Everything Revolution   Ever read this site (now that's a stretch) and wondered what the hell was going on? Or who the hell Pedroz is? Or who the hell Chuck Swirsky is? Or why there seem to be 82 comments after every post? Well, it's time I set out what all this crap means. It's all inside jokes, but for the sake of people's sanity, I suppose these should be put to rest.   "Pedroz": Ah, Pedroz... what a great name. Alright, well as sort of previously explained, "Pedroz" is a character in the comments section representing Shawn's dad. Shawn has told us that his dad (Pete) has the nickname "Pedro" from his friends. Well, Pedro went and got a lisence plate for his car, back in the day... which was suppose to be "Predros" (As in, Pedro's Car). However, it was taken... so Shawn's dad went "Gangst" (as Shawn would say), and made it "Pedroz". Ever since then, the name has lived in history.   "Pedroz": Part Deuz  Alright, so what's with the messed up things we have "Pedroz" say? You'll notice he ends sentences with "Uler" a lot. Well, this all stems from a story Shawn told, where his dad had told Shawn that he saw his friend "Shuler" at the mall. In reality, it was Kevin Sheeler. Don't know why, but that evolved into having Shawn's dad accidently say "uler" at the end of every sentence (in our minds, of course). I assure you, it's hilarious. "Shawn... what's that rapper's name... 50 Culer?" Yeah, we have a lot of time on our hands.   "Pedroz": Part Trois  What's with the Pedroz/Darts relationship? Well, when me, Shawn and Randy were hanging out at Shawn's, we were playing darts. Everything is fine, until Shawn's dad came home. We we're greeted with THIS now world famous conversation:   Shawn's dad: Who's playing with my darts? Shawn: ... we all are. Shawn's dad: No, you WERE playing with my darts.. put them away. Use other ones. Shawn: ... alright. Shawn's dad: You'd prefer the heavier darts anyways... the darts you were using cost me 60 dollars.   So we play on that conversation in EVERYTHING. Go back and read some old comments, and they might make sense now.   Chuck Swirsky and Leo Rautins:  Ah, another set of classic characters created in the comments section. Chuck Swirsky is the local TV announcer here, and he covers the Toronto Raptors in the NBA. He gets excited easily... and makes for great entertainment. As you all know, we are lucky enough to have Vince Carter on our team. When Carter hit an amazing shot, "The Swirsk" (as we call him) said THIS now world famous line:   ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?  AIR CANADA, VINCENT LAMAR CARTER, JUST SHOWED EVERYONE, THAT HE IS THE FRANCHISE!   We of course play on this quote ALL the time. It's funny to us, but I assume to other's it makes no sense. Leo Rautins is the colour commentator that works with Chuck, and usually just pops in with an occasional "Haha, you got that right Chuck".   Street Fighter:  Yeah, we use Street Fighter characters sometimes. I don't know why... but doesn't that game just kick some serious ass? "A Ducts-kick-ba-ru-kick" ... ah, memories.   Adam Sandler:  We feature many, many Adam Sandler references and/or quotes.   Dave Chappelle: Enriching Our Lives With Chappelle's Show:  Do yourself a favour and catch an episode. We tend to use references from it too. It could very well be, without exageration, the funniest show on TV, period.  Well I hope that clears some stuff up. If there's any other weird crap you've never fully understood, feel free to comment below, and we'll try to make sense of it. We're weird, yes... we know. Here's to more updates, eh? Lates.

       The Tar Heels, The Leafs, The March Break, and The Shenanigans   Word up to my peepulation, Mr. X is back on the blog.  Lets just keep things simple and follow the order of the title ... here we go ...   The Tar Heels:  Thats right, my University Of North Carolina Tar Heels picked up a first round victory tonight by defeating the 11th seed Air Force. They now move on to play Texas the 3rd seed on Saturday, should be a great game.  Speaking on NCAA basketball, Daves team Syracuse made it past the first round with a win over BYU, and McCormicks team Duke picked up an easy win over Alabama State. Syracuse will now move on to play Maryland  (I STRONGLY recommend anyone and everyone to watch this game, it will be the game of the tournament)  and Duke is going to play the 8th seeded team Seton Hall.   The Leafs:  After a tough loss to the Bruins on Tuesday, The Leafs picked up a huge 3-2 win over the Philadelphia Failures tonight ... Mr. Brian Leetch had 3 POINTS and Calle Johanson picked up his first points in a Maple Leafs uniform ... Leafs and Avalanche are on Saturday, this is going to be a HUGE game as the Leafs need the 2 points if they want a chance at winning the division ... so lets all cross our fingers for a big Leafs win.  Speaking of the Avalanche game, good old Meg-a-rooni is going to the game in hopes to see Tomas Kaberle play ... he was a scratch on Thursday, but due to Klee's injury, he should be playing Thursday.   The March Break & The Shenanigans:  Well Scarrow brought you up to speed about the weather on Tuesday ... so lets skip ahead to Wednesday ... I decided to tough it out through the Blizzard and take my chances of walking to Daves ... lets just say I almost didnt make it. After taking a wrong turn in the snow, I ended up with snow on the INSIDE of my pants and shoes ... just ridiculously ... when I got to Daves it took me an hour to get all the snow out of my pants. Then we played some good old Gamecube and watched some good old stand up comedians (Warning: This show may contain nudity, "Well, I sorta need to know for sure). Daves mom then bought me dinner, Red Rocket wings, best wings in the entire city I tell ya what.  Today was really the peak of the break however. Me, Dave, McCormick, and two people not blogged about regularly, Dave's dad "Hollywood" and his nextdoor neighbour "Mark-o-lino" went to play some hardcore bowling (thats right, 10 pins with  NO    bumpers!) After I talked some big trash I opened up big with a Strike and 4 spares, but then choked and lost the first game with a final score of 107. Second game I just stunk it up and scored low score of the day with a final score of 84 (yup, I stunk) ... but the third game was simply the best ... not because I won (because I didnt, Hollywood took all 3 games) but because McCormick, using his "spare ball" (it was pink) almost hit himself in the foot with the ball, before getting the worst gutter ball in bowling history. I have never laughed so hard while bowling in my life. Good times.  Tonight was Shenanigans at the Scarrow's house ... only really funny thing was I called the Nirvana song "Smells Like Teen Spirit", "Smells Like Teenage Fever" ... nothing really big of note.  Only 3 days left in the March Break of doom ... Im guessing I will prolly hang with Scarrow and McCormick again 2morrow, possibly at my house which is unusual. And the weekend is still up in the air as to what I am doing ... I have been asked to watch the Leafs game with a certain person, but im not sure if THATS going to happen or not ...   Legacy Springers Final Thought:  Yahoo! Euchre is bullshit, I have lost 9 games in a row and my rating has gone down 122 points ... simply fucking bullshit.  Look for an update sometime this weekend from either Me or Scarrow.   Those contestants not appearing on stage will recieve...

       March Break, March Madness and um... Brian MARCHment   Hey, hey, hey!  How goes it, WR readers? (Yes, all three of you.) Well we're are in the midst of March Break, and oh how sweet it is. Staying up late watching infomercials, and having some guy try to sell you a knife that can cut through a boot, and sleeping in to rediculously late times, just for the hell of it. Here's a rundown of what's gone on so far:  Friday: The March Break started off rather nicely, with a trip to a hockey game. No, not the Leafs... no, not the Bulldogs... ok, so it was my friend Meg's brother's juniour hockey game, but it was still hockey. They lost 6-3, but it's the thought that counts. After the game, we headed to "The Attic" where we PARTIED TO THE BREAK OF DAWN! Ok, not really... Meg's parents were nice enough to take us out for pizza, and then we left around 9:30 to head back home and just hang out. Watched some Seinfeld (that show never gets old), and then headed home.  Saturday: LEAFS VS. CANADIENS! Wait, the Leafs lost... boy, that game really sucked. It was still a fun night, as Vince and Randy came over for the game, and we proceeded to make fun of random people that came on TV. Most significantly, a white Canadian rapper named "Eamon". It was just too easy. Later that same night, Sarah, Steph and Meg came over to hang out for a bit. This was Sarah's last day before she headed for Washington. Fun was had, and then we all walked them back to Meg's house, and then had a RACE home. I dropped out after three or four paces, but eventually caught up in time to see Vince just slightly beat Randy to my door. Good times.  Sunday: Wrestlemania day. What more can be said? Well, The Triad (Me, Shawn, Randy) just hung out the whole day, in a fairly empty house. We played EUCHRE (!!!), ordered pizza, and watched Wrestlemania X-7 on DVD, all in preparations for Wrestlemania XX. A great show, hi-lighted by my brother's friend finding faults in EVERY SINGLE MATCH ON THE CARD. I swear, i've never heard "Oh, that's so terrible" or "Oh, that's just awful" so many times in one night. Still, a fun night capped off by a midnight drive home with "Hey Ya" cranked.  Monday: Ah, the first REAL day of the March Break. Great to hear my alarm go off at 6:30, and be able to just sit back and relax and enjoy the hilarity that is the 102.1 The Edge morning show. Great day all around, as I headed to Vince's to watch THE LEAFS play the Buffalo Sabres. Also there was Steph and Meg, as we played a rousing game of SCRABBLE, as well as FROG SOCCER. We then watched as the Leafs came back from 5-2, to win 6-5 in Overtime. What a game. Also a great night due to the fact that I beat Vince TWICE at ping pong. I also beat Steph, but well... that was a given.  So yes, the March Break has been kind to me so far. It's Tuesday now, and it's snowing... but meh, it'll clear up. Dear God I hope it clears up.  So that's all for now, check out for Randy (Uh, I mean... Legacy X *looks around mysteriously*) to make a new post. Later kids.

       A Joke That Must Be Posted   A woman walks into the downtown welfare office, trailed by 15  kids...  "WOW," the social worker exclaims, "Are they ALL YOURS???"  "Yes'am they is all mine," the flustered momma sighs, having heard that question a thousand times before.  She says, "Sit down Leroy." All the children rush to find seats.  "Well," says the social worker, "then you must be here to sign up.  I'll need all your children's names."  "This one's my oldest--he is Leroy."  "OK, and who's next?"  "Well, this one he is Leroy, also."  The social worker raises an eyebrow but continues. One by one, through the oldest four, all boys, all named Leroy. Then she is introduced to the eldest girl, named Leighroy!  "All right...," says the caseworker, "I'm seeing a pattern here...Are they ALL named Leroy?"  Their Mumma replied, "Well, yes--it make it easier. When it is time to get them out of bed and ready for school, I yells, 'Leroy!' An' when it's time for dinner, I just yell 'Leroy!' an' they all comes arunnin.'  An 'if I need to  stop the kid who's running into the street, I just yell 'Leroy'  and all of them stop. It's the smartest idea I ever had, namin' them all Leroy."  The social worker thinks this over for a bit, then wrinkles her forehead and says tentatively, "But what if you just want ONE kid to come, and not the whole bunch?"  "Ah, that's so easy," said the momma. "Then I calls them by they last names"

       Pre-Weekend & Break Exclusive   Word to my peeps.  WASSUP ya'll?  Alrighty, so its Thursday ... one more day of school before the last big break of the year ... MARCH BREAK (also known as "Spring Break" to Americans). Well ya, I dont really have anything big planned out for the March Break ... Im invited to a St. Patricks Day party, im yet to make up my mind if im going to go or not, but it is a possibility.  Tonight is THE Leafs game ... The debut of Ron Francis ... How great it will be to have "The Shiznet" Ron Francis centering the line of Owen Nolan and Matt Stajan? PURE AWESOMENESS! Should be a good game though, the Pittsburg Penguins, who are clearly not making the playoffs, have been on quite the roll lately, so now its time for us to stop them and pick up 2 more points in hope of winning our Northeast Division.  Now on to this Sunday ... if you are a wrestling fan it is THE biggest day of the year ... thats right ..  WRESTLEMANIA XX!  5 hours of non-stop wrestling action that is going to rock my socks ... and of course when its live from The Scarrow Household it just makes it that much better (thats right, his mom buys   smarties!    Well thats all for now ... I shall indeed update you with Wrestlemania XX results and opinions, and I shall let all know how THE March Break of doom is.    So keep control of the pet population, have you pet spayed or neutred, goodbye everybody!

       I'm a rage-a-holic! I just can't live without rage-a-hol!   Bored.  So Bored.  I AM FRIGGING BORED.  Oh, hey.. how's it going? A/S/L? Do you have a pic?  Alright, i'll stop. How goes it? I'm just sitting here, procrastinating on my biology homework, as per usual... so I figured i'd put up a random and incoherent post. Those, sometimes, are the best posts of them all. See, what am I even talking about? I'm incoherent talking about how i'm going to be incoherent... that's just... well, incoherent.  So the trade deadline has passed, and for those of us lucky enough to be in Canada, all 6 OR 7 HOURS OF COVERAGE ON TV is over. Seriously, it was just a little much. But i'm happy with our deals.. Ron Francis, although slow and dangerous behind the wheel, still does serve a purpose. Chad Kilger is apparently a "project", so in other words, he sucks right now. Cally Johansson? Eh, sure why not. He's unproven if he can still play, but apparently good. He has a funny accent too, so that more than makes up for it. "I came here to win da cup, that's the only reason." Well hey, we could use you, Mr. Johansson.  Speaking of hockey, Tood Bertuzzi is a  no-good, stupid, cheap, jerk of a goon.  That hit was just totally retarded for so many reasons. Punches the guy out, and then just lands on top of him  BREAKING HIS NECK.  Apparently he is "remorseful"... BS.  Why did you do it in the first place, Todd? I will now call him Re-Todd. Re-Todd Bertuzzi. Yeah, I know I stole it from The Edge, but it works.   School really, really... sucks. I'm so...  average.  My marks are all low to mid 80's, which is fine I guess, but it's not what i'm used to. I feel like some teachers think i'm completely stupid. I'm expecting my Chemistry teacher to come up to me and say "Dave, here is a ball... perhaps you'd like to play with it." At least I am making up for it in my two morning classes, where my intelligence is being insulted. Peer Tutoring? I DON'T DO ANYTHING. Nothing at all. I just sit there and answer Grade 9 english questions. We're watching a movie the next couple of days... feel the joy.  The good news is, life's going good, as i'm sure it is for Legaxy X as well. He'll be up next with a post, as i'm outta here. Always remember,   Writer's Revolution: Where Nothing Can Possiblie Go Wrong... Er, PossibLY Go Wrong...

       Up and Running   Yeah, looks like we're officially back on track and have got all the kinks worked out. New posts should start sometime this week. Thanks to Mr. McNally (Legacy X, if you will) for figuring out everything that got our site back to it's original form. It looks snazzy.  Well that's about it for now. I thought I might have had more to say, but I don't. Just happy to have WR back, with a working comments system and everything. Something goes right for once, huzzah!  "If 54 is more than 45 then what is the answer, Martha?" "Nine" "No, it's eeeeeight" "... No, it's niiiiine" "... Yes, I was just testing you, iiiit's niiiine. And that's a magic numbeeer."

      What up gangstas?   Well its been a while since the last post so im gunna give us all a little update about whats been goin down, right here in china town ... or stoney creek whichever name you prefer to call our city.  Philadelphia is dominant? ... pft think again! ... Game 2 was a bunch of bullshit that I wont get into but the Leafs should have tied it up, and we were all over them. Game 3 ... can somebody say the return of WADE BELAK! Its about time Pat Quinn put the big Irish lad back into the line up, and i'd say he delivered. For the first time in this series somebody other then Gary Roberts was laying big hits on Keith "the fag" Primeau. And the Leafs got the big win to make the series 2-1 for the fuckers ... Game 4 friday night ... the rumour is Joe Newy and Owen Nolan will be back in the line up, and boy oh boy are my fingers crosses!  WWE Smackdown! live at the Air Canada Center ... my friend Daryl is hopefully going to pick up tickets Saturday morning and i'll be heading down to Toronto on June 1st for the show. WOO GO WRESTLING!  New Music in the McNally stereo .. what you ask? D-Tweezy (D12). Their newest c.d. entitled "D12 World" featuring 'My Band' and '40 oz.' is pretty awesome. Just more music with Eminem that is off the charts. I also got the J-Kwon c.d. about a week ago called "Hood Hop" and it too is has some pretty sick songs.   Well thats all i can think of for right now ... Calgary will be looking to take a 3-1 series lead on the Detroit Red Wings tonight (COME ON CALGARY!) and the Tampa Bay Lightning will be looking to sweep the Montreal Canadiens tonight (something that the San Jose Sharks could've done last night .. but DIDNT!)  Im out ... later  p.s. Automated Therapist freakin rules ... 102.1, THE EDGE!

      well, as Dave said we got our mid-term marks. my marks are as follows: American History - 60% Biology - 85% Math - 90% English - 95% Average: 82.50 (fucking history)  So the NHL playoffs continued today with Detroit beating the Calgary Flames 5-2. I am pissed that Calgary lost, but I am very happy about what Jerome Iginla did. With like a minute left he fought Darien Hatcher! and not only that, as they were going down, he DRILLED him a nice hard shot right to the face. In the words of Don Cherry "hes a good guy." Seriously, this guy defines the word captain. He scores goals, sets up his team mates, plays physical and gives 100% every shift, and he even fights now to set the tone for his team and and the series. Even though I am Maple Leaf blue through and through, this guy is a beast and I think he is the MVP of the year.   The San Jose Sharks also defeated the Colorado Avalanche today to take a 2-0 series lead, and Patrick Marleau is another crazy beast. Some of the plays he makes and the goals he scores are just incredible, especially the one today. So much patience! If this keeps up, definitly say goodbye to the Avalanche in 4.   Now tomorrow is game two of  THE TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS  and Philadelphia "sucky" Flyers. Newy isn't playing due to his bad back, but captain Mats Sundin is expected to return to the line up. Owen Nolan should be making his return soon too .. and believe me, Leafs in 6, I have faith! GO LEAFS GO!   Tomorrow is also Tampa Bay and Montreal in game 2. Although I  AM NOT  a Habs fan by any means, I'd like to see them win so we can have the Original Six showdown in the conference finals.  But thats all for now I guess. GO LEAFS GO and SUCK FLYERS SUCK!  "your vaccuum cleaner ate my pants .. there was nothing I could do"

      Well today was the day we got our mid-term marks. Both me and Randy had pretty decent marks. Here's the lowdown:  Anthropology/Sociology/Pyschology - 97% Peer Tutoring - 91% Chemistry - 87% Biology - 97% Average: 93.00%  I'm happy. The best part is that I can improve on that, because both Peer Tutoring and Chemistry should go up by the end of the year. Woohoo!  So it's still the playoffs, and the Leafs totally owned the Senators in Game 7 of their series, sending the Leafs through to the next round of the playoofs. Our new enemy? The Philidelphia Flyers. I'll admit, I don't really think the Leafs will be able to handle it. But you never know in the playoffs... here's me showing my Leaf spirit:     Don't I look proud?  GO LEAFS GO, and SUCK FLYERS SUCK.  That is all.

      Ok so as we all know the NHL playoffs have started. Best time of the year if your a sports fan in Canada, as we get to watch like 4 or 5 games a night!   So the TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS are leading the ottawa "sucky" senators 2 games to 1 in the best of 7 series. And Eddie Belfour has back to back shutouts in the series, and 4 shutouts in his last 5 games (3 of those against Ottawa). Now with numbers like that, and when your getting shut outs with 37 shots on you in one game, you would think your skilled right? But there are still the goons out there that say "Belfour sucks, hes garbage, the Leafs suck, they are lucky" blah blah blah.  Its simple.  To be good you have to be lucky, its true, its true. And I personally would just like to know how Ed Belfour can "suck" when the guy has like 10 shut outs this year, he is one of the leading shut out leaders of all time, one of the most winningest goalies in the history of hockey, AND has his name on the Stanley Cup. So please find something to convince me otherwise ... BI-ATCH!  Leafs in 5, GO LEAFS GO!

      Your soundtrack to this post: Nirvana - Greatest Hits  Well, well, well. Look who came crawling back.  Hey guys, welcome to the Weekend Update.  Well it looks as though the Leafs better win tonight. They are down 0-1 in the best of seven series against the Ottawa "Sucky" Senators. If they get down 0-2, I fear they are done. Go Leafs Go.  Speaking of which, I am getting VERY sick and tired of people coming up to me when i'm wearing my Owen Nolan jersey and saying "Hey! How's YOUR LEG DUDE! HAHAHAHA!" Hahahah... SHUT UP, FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY, PLEASE. You aren't funny, you aren't original, and you certaintly don't know what you are talking about. Do future society a favour and don't breed.  Owen Nolan will return by the end of the playoffs. I promise you.  In the meantime, I had a great experience on the bus today. Going to the mall, by myself, as I had nothing better to do, I decided to take the bus. It was going fine, until these two HUGE guys got on, about half-way there. They seemed to be of some African descent, and that's all fine and dandy, except they were talking in another language AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS. I'm not sure if they think we can't hear them when they are speaking another language or what, but they were like yelling to each other. YOU AREN'T STEALTH IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE, WE CAN STILL HEAR YOU.  Later on, on the same bus trip, these two girls came on. They seemed fairly normal. Except of course when they started talking.  "HAHAHA, your pants are BLACK Sara." "NO THEY ARE NOT! THEY ARE BLUE! Shut up Krystal!" "HAHAHAHAHAHA" "Excuse me... what colour do you think her pants are?" "Black" "SEE! I TOLD YOU!!!" "HAHAHAHA, omg YOU ARE BEING SO LOUD!" "Now everyone thinks we are weird... HAHAHAHA" "I think we are weird, Sara! HAHA!"  ... Oh ... my ... Swirsky. SHUT IT, PLEASE! I agree, you are weird... NEVER GO OUT IN PUBLIC AGAIN. Thank you.  On top of that, someone came on the bus on the way home that was wearing a rabbit hat. I don't even want to get into that story or I might have to smash my keyboard over my head.  That's your weekend update, i'm Dave. Drive safe, and for the love of Leetch, DON'T TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

      YES! 4 Day weekend! WOO!  so .. how goes it? Well, my Easter weekend started off on a MAJOR downside ... so ya, turns out doing that Biology lab (look below) gave me an infection and due to this infection i was coughing and spitting up blood. So ya im sitting in english class and this blood starts coming out of my mouth so my teacher Mr. Barton like FLIPS out and like runs to the office and calls my parents and tells them to take me to the hospital. So ya they did and now im on like 4 bottles of medication and the blood was suppose to stop but so far its gotten worse.  Of course yesterday was also  GAME 1  of the Leafs vs Senators playoff series .. THE battle of Ontario. The game was going all fine and dandy until  THE COCK SUCKER REFS CALL 2 PENALTIES WITHIN 20 SECONDS THAT WERE BRUTAL!!!!!!  Then the Sens scored on the 5 on 3, and then the 5-4 to take the lead, and ended up winning game 1. Thats alright though, I called Leafs in 5, next 4 games are gunna be the Leafs.  So ya .. this post doesnt exactly say much about Easter ... but if you live in Canada ... ok wait thats wrong ... if your me and my dad Easter basically means a 4 days weekend with lots and lots of hockey to watch.   GO LEAFS GO!!!!!   *just a quick note .. as you can see we now have a title heading thingy ... yup, i thought the way Lauren has her blog is really cool so im stealing the title idea lol*

      Well, this weekend was the Victor Neumann Invitational Golf Classic ... and yes only The Triad took part in the tournament. But sense it was Victor Neumann's tournament, he decided to fly in for the weekend and take part in all the festivities.  So Friday night we headed to the Buffalo Airport to pick up Mr. Neumann. Clearly he was not impressed when he saw he would be going to his tournament riding a banana seat bike. But those are the breaks. By the time we got to Niagara Falls he needed a break so we decided to have a break at a local bar. We headed inside to check the happenings and grab a quick drink, and when we headed back outside we saw Mr. Neumann talking to 'ladies of the night' who were interested in making a name for themselves on Victor. Well we got him out of that trouble and back on the banana seat bike and headed back for the creek. On the way home Mr. Neumann was interested in some of the colourful people around the hood, so we gave him the low down. I mean there IS 'The Neighbourhood Golf Ball Dealer' and The Local Wendys .. err i mean ... Japanese Slave Factory. So Mr. Neumann was slightly interested.  So Saturday morning Mr. Neumann was up bright and early, he REALLY wanted to see the slave factory. He got himself all dressed, and then used his TRAVELLING MICRO-TRIMMER to get rid of his excess facial and nose hair. Then it was off to the slave factory. When we first walked in, the smell of sweat was unbearable, and to see the poor souls working their asses off was .. well sad .. but Mr. Neumann couldn't get enough of it, even going as far as ordering 93 SERVINGS OF FRIES! Of course, he got the meal that came with the fries, and since there was a meat delay on the grill it took like 4 hours to get the damn food. But finally we got the damn food, and being the generous man that he is, Mr. Neumann donated the food to local loser Derek Bunker. But Mr. Neumann wasn't finished, did you know that he has a gambling problem!? Well since we dont have any casino's around here, and we wern't gunna peddle back to Niagara Falls on banana seat bikes we decided to gather up the locals for the "Neighbourhood Series of Poker." Of course McCormick was at the table, seeing as how he is the poker king down here. There was also Robyn Williams, The chinese guy from Video 99, the owner of Avondale, Mr. Milovanov, and Hale Irwin. In the end, Poker King McCormick prevailed and bought out the pizza store beside Avondale. He's currently working out a deal to buy Video 99 aswell. And that was pretty much Saturday, as after Poker local loser Derek Bunker returned to get Mr. Neumanns autograph because he was too stupid to get it earlier.   And then Sunday rolled around, Mr. Neumann sang 'Take Me Out To The Ball Game' for some odd, odd reason, and the tournament was under way. Throughout the day Mr. Neumann kept making cat noises and looking at the sky, but no one could understand what the hell he was doing. In the end McCormick took the win with a 48, Scarrow had a 49, and I shot a 50 in a really close tournament. Mr. Neumann was upset that he never got to see the neighbourhood golf ball dealer .. but then SECONDS LATER, we looked into the forest, and THERE HE WAS, looking for lost golf balls to sell to children when he helps them cross the street in the morning. Of course Mr. Neumann had to buy a souveneir to take home with him. Then, Mr. Neumann got into a helicopter that was piloted by ALF and went back to where ever the hell he was from.  And that was the weekend .. pure awesomeness   ***NOTE: SOME OF THE THINGS IN THIS STORY MAY BE EXAGGERATED***

      well my biology teacher told me this joke .. i dont think its fall off your chair funny, but its humorous so here goes ...  A guy is in a really important golf tournament, the winner recieved 1 million dollars. So he's on the 8th hole and he has a 45 foot putt for par. He doesnt think he has a chance to make the putt until a little old man comes over. The old man says to him "if you are willing to give up 1/3 of your sex life, I guarantee you will make this putt." The man thinks about it for a second and then says "1/3? Thats no problem." Sure enough, the man hits the long putt to remain tied for second place. The man then comes to the 15th green and has a 30 foot putt for birdie, and the lead. He again thinks he will miss the putt until the same little old man comes over and says "for another 1/3 of your sex life, I guarantee you will make this putt." The man again thinks for a second and says "another 1/3, no problemo" and again sinks the putt to become tied for the lead. So finally the man is on the 18th green, and has a putt for birdie. If he sinks it he wins the tournament, and the 1 million dollars, but if he misses he loses the tournament. Once again, this little old man comes out of the forest and says "for the last 1/3 of your sex life, I guarantee you'll make the putt." The man doesnt even think this time and says "no problem, sex life, 1/3, gone, I want this win." Sure enough, the man makes the putt, and wins the 1 million dollars. The little old man then comes up to him and says "I just hope you know, you made a deal with the devil, because I am Satan and you no longer have a sex life, ahaha!" the man replies "well just so YOU know, i've been a priest for 15 years"

      Well it has been a while since I posted on the blog so I thought I would put up the lastest happenings.  Well last Thursday was probably the best day of the week for me. We didn't do much work in any of my first two classes. School is winding down and slowly things are getting easier. Then Thursday at lunch my entire biology class went to The Mandarin for lunch, and it was freakin awesome. Best lunch ever, no lie. Friday wasn't really anything big. I presented my biology i.s.u. (independant study unit) and I got a 90% so that was good.  Saturday was the first golf day of the year, and as The Triad calls it the "Tee Off Invitation 2004." Me and Dave were the co-defending champions going on, as we tied last year in the opening round. This year, we went into the final hole tied yet again, and I ended up beating Dave by 1 stoke. Champ 2 years in a row! lol  Saturday night, Me and Dave went to our friend Stephs house with Vince, and Allison, and we played Balderdash. I totally forgot how awesome that game really is. The funniest response of the night had to go to Vince with "started the first national yacth club" and "Humping Horis' Ape" ... then before we were done playing Megan showed up too and then we watched Dickie Roberts. It was the first time I had ever seen that movie and it was pretty funny, but it seemed kind of predictable throughout the movie as to what was going to happen. Then when the movie was done Allison drove us all home. So Saturday was indeed a wicked day all around.  And today, well it's pretty much just been a relaxing day. I played some Fight Night 2004 (seriously the best boxing game ever) and then I ate lunch, and now im watching the Calgary Flames vs San Jose Sharks game 4 of the Western Conference Finals. And right now its 4-1 and looks like San Jose is going to win this game and tie the series.  Well im outta here ... lets hope the school week goes by rather quickly as next weekend is  MAY 2-4!  which means the carnival is right beside my house and Sunday night is fireworks.

      Well ... Friday was my last exam, and then since Friday at 2:00 Summer has been in full tilt ...    Friday   Well it started off by going to Megans house where a bunch of us met. Then we split into differn't cars and headed down to Adventure Village at the Beach Strip. Eventually everyone showed up and then we went to the batting cages. Me, Dave, and Shawn went into the 'medium speed' cages that were FREAKING fast. I only got a hold of one and it went sideways, and Shawn sent one backwards. But then we went in the 'slow speed' cages and I totally ruled ass in those.   Then we split into two groups and went mini-putting. The first group was Me, Rachel, Dave, and Sarah and the second group was Shawn, Vince, Steph, and Megan. The first hole of the day and the first person to go, Rachel, got a hole-in-one which is impressive. Well I mean nobody else did it, so it had to be impressive. Hit of the round however had to go to Sarah Mayo who hit her ball and got it stuck in the trees ... classic. In the end yours truly ended up with the big 'DUBYA' with a score of 44, beating Shawn who scored a 45 and Vince who scored a 46 marginally. Then some of us went back to Daves.  At Daves we played some good old soccer for quite a while until Vince and others had to leave which left The Triad for a usual Friday night. Dave's neighbour Mark came over for a while and we ended up playin Texas Hold 'Em poker which is always fun. Then we decided to go golfing and Dave thought it would be easier if we just stayed the night at his house so we could go golfing early in the morning, so we went home and got our stuff and then went to McDonalds for ice cream and then back to Daves in time for David Letterman and his band to sing "KNOW YOUR LOCAL CBS WEATHERMAN!"    Saturday   Well The Triad and Mr. Scarrow got up and went golfing in what we called "The Milovanov Buddy Classic Open." Dave dominated the round and got his first tournament win of the year tieing The Triad up at one win each.   After golf I headed to my grandparents house to visit my cousins and aunt and uncle who are down from New Jersey and we played some Mario Kart Double Dash. Later on Vince asked me if I wanted to hang out with a bunch of people and I of course wanted to.  So Saturday night Steph walked to my house and then we walked down to Paramount Park and met up with Vince and Rachel and then Nichole came a few minutes later. We pretty much just walked around and played keep up with Vince's soccer ball all night but it was still fun.     Sunday   Sunday I got up and my grandpa called and wanted to take me and my siblings out for lunch and stuff. So we went mini-putting and then he took us to McDonalds and then he brought us home.   When I got home me and Dave made plans to go to the movies to go see Ferenheit 9/11. So we went to Silver City at like 5 to make sure we got tickets and then we went to Chapters to kill some time, looking at books and stuff. My favourite had to be "Jerry Seinfeld: SEINlanguage." Anyways we headed back to Silver City and ate and then we went into the theatre which was PACKED ... EVERY seat was taken. The movie itself was really good I thought ... The only thing that made my stomach turn was when they showed a public beheading. But all in all it was a great movie I thought.  So thats been my weekend. Busy busy busy but fun as hell. Lets hope the Summer stays this way and goes by SLOW.

      Yeah, so England lost... and Italy is long gone... we'll put soccer to rest for another two years. But that doesn't matter, because exams are over, and that means...  SUMMER. It's here.  I'm ready. I'm ready to stay up until 2:00 AM every night, and sleep in until 11:00 AM every morning. I'm ready to not care about school. I'm ready to have no stress. I'm ready to beat Shawn and Randy at golf on a weekly basis.  I gotta keep this short, 'cause i'm heading out to celebrate, but I will say this. It's good to be free once again. Now i'll leave it up to Randski to do a proper post.

      Well, it has finally arrived. This weekend, was without doubt, the unofficial summer kick off. Now, we may have one more week of classes... and then, a week of exams, but this weekend just felt like summer to me. It was nice. I'm very much ready for summer to be here now.  The weekend started off great, as I went for my second time at my friend Steph's church youth group. Steph's lead's the band, and I must say, she does have a great voice... about ten times better than the one she uses in Chemistry class singing songs you'd hear on your parents radio station. Anyways, after that, we decided we were gonna head out to Steph's house. The drive home was very entertaining, as Allison drove, and me, Steph, Vince and Steph's cousin Jess road with her. Allison decided she would stop for gas, and that of course was the perfect oppurtunity for Steph to honk the horn with "the club". This freaked Allison out, as she was filling up at the time.  We then drove Jess home to pick up some stuff before heading to Steph's. We were waiting in her driveway when these punk-ish looking 11 year olds road right in front of her van on their bikes, across Jess' lawn. This was also the perfect oppurtunity for Allison to honk the horn, and you could see one of the kids look back and the Van and mouth "What the fu-...".  So, back at Steph's, we watched Pirates of the Carribean. Meh, alright I guess... way too long though.  I got home around 1:00 a.m, so that wraps up my Friday. Yeah, I was tired.  Saturday was a whole other day of adventure. Me, Vince and Steph decided to head to the mall together to get a gift for Megan, as it was her birthday. We definitley had a blast, especially in the toys etc. store. We bought "Arthur in a Bag" for God know's what reason. We also stopped in at Toys R Us, where Steph procided to play with a hula hoop.  Then, the actual party came around 6:00 p.m or so. We walked over to Meg's. Present at the party was...  Meg (Well, clearly) Rachel Sarah Resident Goon, Shawn McCormick Junior Vice-President Goon, Randy McNally Steph Lindsay Vince Aleasha aaaaand C.E.O of Goon Operations, Me.  McCormick started the party off well, when I went to go chase a football that had been thrown over the fence... little did I know, they had already got the ball, so when I went over to get it, McCormick through it straight down and hit me in the groin. It hurt.  A lot.  But it was funny.  Very funny.  Fun was had later on... especially playing this game where if you can't think of an answer, you get  SPRAYED IN THE FACE WITH WATER.  My personal favourite would be when the question was "Things You Find In A Girl's Purse", and it came to me, I said "My phone number." Thank you, thank you... thank you.  I also accidently smashed Nichole over the head with the thing that gives out the questions. I laughed... checked to see if she was ok... then pointed and laughed some more.  Later, when it was dark, we headed over to Paramount Park just to hang out and such... buuut we got bored, so we went back to Megan's backyard to... well, hang out and such. But it wasn't as boring because there were TORCHES... and chairs. Chairs are good.  The party ended with an unfortunate "ice brawl" with the leftover ice from the cooler. I think McCormick and Randy each got hit in the face a good two or three times. Then Randy accidently through one right into Lindsay's lap. Classic.  Then it came time to go... but a good time was had.  Well, it's only Saturday night now, so the weekend isn't over... but my goodness, does it feel like summer. I couldn't be happier about it either. Hm, it's only Saturday night, so hence, there may be stuff that could happen tomorrow...  This may include: My brother, a birthday, a wrestling mask, a resturant, a ppv, and golf. They'll all add up somehow.  I swear, they will.  Dave

      Word up.  Do you know what today is?  "Today? Why, today, sir...is Christmas day!"  No, not you... the other small boy. Yes, that's right, it's Wednesday... quite possibly THE most boring day of the week. I mean, there's absolutley nothing going on. No homework, no one's around, nothing good on TV, no one online.  So with that, I update the site.

      Well lets rewind this to last Thursday ... I started getting pains in my stomach area and in my back .. they were pretty sore but nothing too too drastic. I mean i've had worse. Now lets fast forward to yesterday. I was on my way over to Daves house and the pains (that I had from last week) kept getting worse and worse to the point I could barely walk. I went to the store near Daves house and just sat down on the curb for a minute and then went in and bought chips to bring to Scarrows. So I walked from the store to Daves where the pains got so bad I had to sit down in Daves house cause I couldnt move. It was the worst pain i've ever had. So this morning I got up and my mom took me to the hospital to see what the hell was going on. So first they give me a cup and a wetnap and the lady tells me to "wipe and pee" .. wipe what? ... I mean at first I thought she wanted me to wipe 'down there' but that didnt seem right .. so i just wiped my hands with it and went on with my business. So then they make me sit in this hospital room for so long and the doctor comes in to have a word with me and tells my mom to leave the room. Then the conversation went on like this ...  Doctor: so you have pains? Randy: ya Doctor: are you sexually active? Randy: no Doctor: are you sure? Randy: .. pretty sure Doctor: have you ever been sexually active? Randy: no Doctor: ok...  and then she just leaves ... doesnt say anything just leaves. So im thinking like "what the fuck is going on ... do I have like AIDS or something?" ... so after about another 25 minutes the same doctor comes back and asks me AGAIN "are you sexually active" so now im really thinking I got like AIDS or some shit ... then she tells me to take off my clothes .. which I declined .. ok maybe taking off my clothes was something I shouldnt have decline since it was a medical thing, but I dont think my wang has anything to do with stomach pains and I dont think I needed to whip it out for some doctor I dont know. So she checked 'the region' and then says she needs to check the urine sample again. So now the question I have is "did I not wipe correctly?" ... so ANOTHER like half an hour goes by and she comes in again and says "your urine is all clean ... i dont see anything wrong you can go home"   now wait JUST a minute here ... I spent 2 and a half hours here and your going to just tell me to leave and not figure out whats wrong ... I dont think so BI-ATCH. So my mom starts asking like "arn't you going to do like an x-ray or ultrasound to see if there is something wrong" and this bitch doctor is all "who's the doctor here? what's that going to do .. we checked his urine and nothing is wrong so if the pains don't go away come back later" and the bitch leaves. So I spent 3 hours in a hospital for them to tell me I have clean pee ... wow.  So now im sitting here at home, in tons of fucking pain, barely able to walk yet again tonight and im not going to waste another 3 hours in the hospital so they can tell me "you have clean pee" again.  What fucking bullshit

      Yes. It's true. I have returned.  The summer is fast approaching, and lucky for YOU guys, that means more me! Exams are in just over two weeks time. After that, I am free to update the site as often as I want to. Maybe i'll actually use this site for what it was originally meant to be; a place to share all kinds of writing, by me, as well as Randy, and some other guest writer's. Hopefully, we'll have Shawn write some stuff for the site... we just got to get him an account. As well as writing ability. We'll work on both of those, ol chap.  I really lost track of "The White Experience", as work just piled up and it became too much of a chore to find it, edit it, and post it. Maybe White will be back this summer with more of his crazy views. Right after he leaves the insane aslyum, due to his Sharks choking in the Eastern Conference final. *Insert the Price is Right losing horn*.  I've been working on a lot of writing... some short stories, a few poems, scripts (!!), as well as a series of articles that i've labled "High School Chronicles". I'm proud of them, so once I have time, i'd like to start putting them to print and testing them here.  There's a lot of choices i've made about where I am going with my life in the next few years, and writing is definitley a major part of it. I've decided i'd like to try and become a high school teacher, and gain acceptance to a concurrent program at Brock University, where i'll be able to earn a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Education at the same time. Hopefully, my writing can be a big part of this, as there's many projects i'd like to work on while i'm still young.  I have a lot of aspirations, and it's time I started the next stage of my life. Hope you're all in for the ride, it's bound to be a good one... and at the very least, it'll be great to see me mess up a lot.  I figure if I become a teacher, i'm gonna have the summer off... that will be a great oppurtunity to explore different possibilities with my writing. I can work on  side-projects, and maybe even open my own business someday. Yeah, my mind's going in weird directions lately, but i'm happy with the choices I have either already made, or am about to make.  High school only has one more year left for me... it's going to be an interesting one. Hopefully experience new things, new people, and probably new problems... but they are ones I am willing to face. I plan on keeping this site up to date regularly, so you can all read along my (hopefully) interesting next few years.  As for the blog, we're trying to set up a new template and an easier comment system. Try the stuff out... we now have profiles (only mine is up at the moment, Randy's will be up shortly). Tell us how you think the new layout looks.  Well, that's about it... hopefully me and Randy can update this thing with good frequency, and with good articles. Thanks for reading, you all rock.  "You let him watch those damn Muppets... I mean, they've got a frog kissing a pig... what did they think was gonna happen?"

      Hey all. &nbsp; Been working on a little half script/book story called "17 Things To Do Before I Die". I'm waivering on if it's actually&nbsp;a good idea, so&nbsp;i'd like some help. All I have is a rough outline of what I want the first chapter (or volume, whatever) to be. I'm gonna post it now, so if you could leave a comment or whatever, that'd be awesome. &nbsp; The plot i'm working with is about Zack Morgan, a 17 year-old from Thunder Bay, ONT who becomes tired with his "pointless" life. He decides he is going to commit suicide, but before he does, he wants to go on a&nbsp;road trip&nbsp;to different places, doing different things that he wouldn't normally do (be it commit a robbery or drive his dad's car off a cliff) but knows that he can because at the end of it all he's going to kill himself anyways. This means he will not have to face the consequences of all his actions,&nbsp;and that the world will finally remember him for something. &nbsp; So, here goes. &nbsp; "17 Things To Do Before I Die" &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live an overly complicated and complex life in which I do nothing. I know that probably sounds like some sort of impossible enigma, but it's true. I live in Thunder Bay, a place that has neither been good nor bad to me. It's just sort of been there. I don't do much other than school, work and sleep, and I suppose my personality goes to show that. I have a part-time job at the grocery store down the street, but that surprisingly does not fill the void of excitement that my life craves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a girlfriend, and I think that I love her. Well, at least I think I do. I mean, how am I suppose to know what love is? No one ever told me, and I haven't exactly been motivated to go out and experience it in my life. I mean, I think she loves me back, but I can never be too sure. I look at her sometimes, and all I get in return is a dead-cold stare that can't help but give me the distinct feeling she'd rather be staring at something else. Or someone else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most days I sit at home and watch TV. Sometimes I go outside and throw a football around if i'm feeling particularly adventurous. I love football. It's gotten me through a lot of rough times, and it's always given me a reason to shut out the world around me. For better or worse, it's worked over the years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always dreamt of making the NFL someday, but I know that's not realistic. I mean, i've been told by my dad and gym coach that i'm not good enough for my entire life, so that dream became more of a nightmare that I wanted to avoid thinking about. There's nothing harder than trying to surpress wanting something so badly when you know that it's not possible to acheive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing is, I have a lot of problems. A lot. Now, with the seemingly pointless life I lead, how the hell could I have any serious problems? Well, it's simple really... my mind. My mind is a fuel for good and evil, and a place that never rests. I do nothing, but that doesn't stop my mind from contnually torturing me with life's problems. I've been told my mind is a gift by my History teacher, Mr. Strata. I prefer to call it a curse. I mean, it can bring me joy, but at the same time, it brings a lot of agony. Sometimes, I just can't stop thinking, and so I think about how I can't stop thinking. Viscous cycle, rinse, wash, repeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents don't really see that part of me though. They think i'm a perfectly normal 17 year old honour student. Everything in that last sentence was true, minus the word normal. I am not normal, and I know that. God, would I kill to be normal. I suppose that theory's going to be tested soon enough though, so i'll have to keep in mind that I said that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a shame, but i've had enough of this life. This hell. This nothingness. This curse. All I do is think, and think until I drive myself insane. Maybe that's already happened, i'm not exactly sure. It's just this constant thought with a void-filled uneventful life is not a good combination. I think about problems, think about war, think about friends, think about life, think about death. I'm slowly, internally shutting down, whether or not those around me are willing to admit it or not. It's not really worth it... it's not worth it to continue living when I do nothing. That's why I plan on changing that. People are going to know my name, and I will have made an impact. If all goes to plan, by the end of the week, I will have forever made a name for myself in this town, this province, this country, this world. Too bad I won't be here to enjoy it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't feel sorry for me... I have no one to blame but myself. I've had the chance to change, but I never took the right steps. My mind always got in the way, no matter how hard I tried to supress it. But it's gotten to the point that if I try to supress these thoughts anymore, my mind will commit self-murder. It will kill itself, and i'm not willing to let that happen. For once, i'm going to take control, and take charge in my life. For once, i'm going to step out into the world with a purpose, a plan, and action. I'm going to fill the empty void and i'm going to do it in style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just let me call Brit. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ &nbsp; Alright, so thats it... not exactly the most exciting stuff, but it's needed to set the story up properly. So, if you've got anything to say about it please, please leave a comment or drop me an e-mail at  urlLink dscarrow05@hotmail.com  Thanks guys. &nbsp; Later, Dave &nbsp;

      Alright, i've stolen this from Lauren, who stole it from her friend, who stole it from another friend. I'm still creative though, I promise.  Instructions: Write one statement to 20 (I'm gonna do 15... 'cause well, i'm just not that popular) people you know. Never tell which one is for who. Try to guess which ones are for you, but don't ever ask me because I won't tell you.  And now, in no particular order:  1. Pretty much my longest friendship. 12 years now? Now if only you didn't like foreign defensemen... 2. Collect phone calls are a entertainment source like no other. TITLEWARS!!! 3. My promise will be kept. The elephant will be yours at graduation next year. Too bad our "underground relationship" never fully caught on. 4. See you in the car. This game's great and i'll i've done is enter my name: Thrillhouse. 21 will ALWAYS be awesome. In more ways than one...  5. Yellow Wizard, Blue Jester and RED BARRELS. You play it where it f'ing lies! F you! 6. It's too bad we don't talk or see each other as much. Coldplay's still good. The guy with sparkle gel in his hair will never be.  7. Please don't comment on this post. Please. I've seen enough of the Wizard of (Insert random noun or adjective) to last me a lifetime. 8. I never understood your fascination with Gabe. Ever. Grade 7 conversations about Degrassi and the Trix rabbit are still remembered. 9. No, I don't hate you... but school sure was "interesting" at times. Just remember to use your indoor voice, and keep praying really hard (but don't hurt yourself) 10. C'est feminano. Blown out any candles on Bert and Ernie cakes lately? 11. Hey, that guy looked like Bradford How. Swatty McByeBye. Willie Augustine saw you lining up. 12. Elyte representin'... MSN freestyles will live on forever. As will 3 AM conversations. Ooh ooh yeah yeah.  13. New York's finest. I may not be a Florida go-er, but I still wish we talked more. 14. Your choice in hockey teams is suspet. Aside from that, your better than dirt. Well, not that fancy store-bought dirt... you can't compete with that. 15. "Didn't like the candy?" "It tasted like glass"

       Sunburns:  Ok, maybe I had this one coming .. I mean I have been outside pretty much all day since summer started ... then on Tuesday afternoon Me & Rachel and Vince and Dave walked around for a little while then me and Vince played soccer against his garage. So I go home to eat dinner and have a shower and I look in the mirror and the back of my neck is sunburnt ... ok, a sunburn wouldn't be AS bad if my whole body got burnt .. then at least it turns into a tan somewhat .. but this is JUST on my neck. Like how in the hell does that fucking work?   The Big "L":  Nope, this is not a category from double jeopardy. Again on Wednesday night we went to Vinces house and everybody got the sudden urge to go swimming in Vince's 3 foot pool in their clothes. Then when I wouldn't go in the pool with my clothes, I got the big loser name slapped at me. Sorry, didn't know I had to go swimming in my clothes when I didn't want to, and when I was freezing cold anyways. Of course everyone was just joking around, and I laughed about it later, but at the time I was pissed.   "The Shadow":  I go to the movies to see Spiderman 2 at Silver City today. Of course the little window where the movie comes out of is where a couple seats are so when people get up there is a shadow. Now normally, if people think they are going to have a sudden urge of diarrhea they  DONT  sit in those seats, so that they dont disturb the movie. Well that was until today. This one lady must have gotten up out of her seat 7 TIMES! ... SEVEN ... WHO THE FUCK GETS UP OUT OF THEIR SEAT 7 TIMES!? And I mean its not just like a little thing in the corner of the screen .. it is a giant head, in the middle of the screen, blocking the movie. Like geeze, once is acceptable, even twice is alright .. but SEVEN times is just pushing it .. and asking for the bird. Murphy.   Irony:  Wednesday night dave was running at the pool, and then he slipped and landed on his back. Ok, i DO know how much it hurts when that happens, but it was still funny as hell. Anyways, as I was laughing, I turned around, went to take 3 steps to sit down on the deck .. and WHAM ... I did the same thing Dave did, except I landed on the concrete, and cut my knee. Damn irony.   Cuts on my knee:  Self explanitory.   .. thats pretty much it for now .. but it is only Wednesday night, so im sure more things will piss me off this week. Oh and heres one more thing that pisses me off ...   No comments:  I know this comment system isn't as good as the old one, but you could at least leave an anonymous comment .. something that tells us that at least somebody is reading the blog.

      Alright, so i'm sitting here at approximatley 12:35 a.m, Friday night. HOLY CRAP! Conan's on!  *Goes to see if it's any good*  Eh, it was just a repeat.  Anyways, being bored out of my mind like I am, I thought now was a good a time as any to just fire off some random stuff, hopefully, for the entertainment of everyone, including me.  Alright, so i've ranted on public transportation before, but apparently the fine folks who take the bus didn't read my brilliant post. WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE BUS IN THIS CITY? Last time I told you guys about my experience with two obnoxiously irritaing girls on the bus. Here's a quick recap:  "OMG, Lauren, your pants ARE BLUE!!!" "No they are not Becky! THEY ARE SOOOOO BLACK!" "HAHA, YOU ARE CRAZY LAUREN! Look... that's blue! Hey, mister... are her pants BLUE!?" "Um, yeah..." "HAHA.. SEE! I TOLD YOU!" "OMG, THEY ARE ALL LOOKING AT US! They think we're crazy!!! HAHAHAHA!"  ... For the love of God, I do not know how I made it through that ride without punching someone. Really.  Well, one time shouldn't sour my thoughts on the bus forever, should it? Quite simply: YES.  Me and Randy took the bus down to the mall, and everything was going fine, until suddenly... I can't beleive i'm typing this but...   A man, who looked to be in his late 50's, early 60's, came on the bus, SINGING AND CLAPPING.    SINGING... AND CLAPPING.   Simply stunning.  This man clearly had some sort of mental problem, but boy, that doesn't stop Toothless Pete from taking the bus, does it?  So he comes on the bus, and continues to sing EXTREMLEY LOUD so that everyone can here am. The thing is... THE SONG WASN'T EVEN REALLY A SONG. He just simply sang about whatever came to his head. I swear, if I had like kicked him in the stomach this guy would have been like "Ooooowww.. myyyy stomach, it hurts! Oh yeah.. la la la la la... that guy kicked me good. Doo doo doo dah dah dah... kicking me, LA LA LA".  Here are some classic one-liners we got from this man:  "Ooooooh... i'm taking the bus, and we're on the road, but i'm not carrying a load!" "You see that sign, it says 'Don't walk in front of the bus', but I don't have a motor!" "Pull the string, pull the lever, gotta stop the bus!"  Of course, as any normal human being would, I spent the rest of the bus ride looking out the window, biting my lip trying not to laugh. I mean, I know it's not the man's fault that he has some mental problem, but how in the heck do these people always manage to find the bus I'M taking, on that same day. I swear, I could go on a trip to Cuba and somehow, if i'm taking a bus, the blueblack pants twins and toothless Pete would all show up too.  Alright, moving along...  Why can't a round of golf be normal for me? Seriously?  OK, flashback a year. Me, Randy, Shawn and my dad are all playing golf. We come to the hole that runs along the road. Randy tees  off and...  *SMACK*  Yup, he hit a car. Did the guy notice? Hm, I dunno... oh look, a man is walking up the fairway now. I wonder if that's him.  "Hey, what the hell you doing hitting my car with a ball *directed at Shawn, who didn't even hit the ball*" "I didn't hit your car, sir" "Oh, don't give me that crap, I saw ya lining up" Randy: I hit a car, yes "Oh, so it was you... what the hell is your problem." My dad: Well, he didn't MEAN to, sir "I don't care if he meant to... God, you're lucky it wasn't my son's Mustang, or he woulda shoved those clubs right up your..."  Yeah, we don't need to continue that story. But really, would that happen to anyone BESIDES us at golf? Oh, I highly doubt it. I mean, this past week, I went out with Shawn and my dad, and Shawn drove a golf ball, into almost NEGATIVE yardage. How is this possible? I mean, this is how it went...  Shawn swings. "What.... the hell.... was that"  Of course me and my drop killed ourselves laughing, but really, it's my curse... I always must bring the most craziest happenings to wherever I am at. In this same round?  A MAN IN HEADPHONES WAS WALKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FAIRWAY WHEN WE WERE TEEING OFF . What is this guy's problem? Did he spot a quarter from fifty feet out and say "Duuuuh... WOOOOW! A shiny quarter! Duuuuuuuuh... I must get it at once!" Or perhaps he saw a hoola-hoop, and by golly, you can't leave a hoola-hoop just sitting there, right? Of course not! You've gotta run out and go DIRECTLY IN THE PATH OF A GOLF BALL.  Man, I love life.
