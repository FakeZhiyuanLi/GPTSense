      While a few posts ago I stated my hatred of all things Michigan and having my life ripped away from me. There are some advantages.  With some of the money that I got from my pension, I bought a Martin D16 acoustic guitar and started re-learning how to play it.  It had literally been years since I last played a guitar. I stopped playing back when my first marriage dissolved. I wasn't very good to be sure, but I was learning little by little. But now I'm back in full force learning everything I can. The advantage is that I have all day long to practice and learn!  I've been playing now for 7 months now, by far the longest I've ever spent on an interest other than computers and movies. I usually get interested in something, absorb a vast about of knowledge about it, then 2 weeks later dump it in favor of something new. So far the guitar has hung around.  I love this Martin. It's the cheapest  real  Martin you can get. When I say "real" I mean made in USA, all solid wood construction (no Korean made plywood Martins here). It sounds like a dream now that 7 months of playing have opened up the wood and it resonates like a bell.  The thing now is, I'd also like to pick up an electric guitar...but that is much more money because you have to buy the guitar, the amp, the cords, the effects etc etc. It's like a never ending quest for a different tone. With the acoustic though, you concentrate on actually  playing  instead of effects.  I may be getting to the point though where I'm going to have to start taking formal lessons, because I really have no direction in my learning. I know the major chords by heart and quite a few minor and weird ones, plus some songs with alternate tunings....but no theory really.  We'll see how it goes....

      What a weird time it was in 1977. Let's see, there was the New York Blackout, Star Wars was first hitting the big screen and changing the world. Son of Sam was running amok. John Wayne died.  And the King of Rock & Roll passed away on this day in 1977. I was 15 at the time back then and I remember my parents were HUGE Elvis fans. We had quite the collection of Elvis albums my Mom would play all the time. It was weird though that the "King of Rock &amp; Roll" was only heard on Country & Western radio stations back then.  Actually, dying was the best thing to happen to Elvis. Think about it, if he was still alive today, not only would he be very old, he would probably be out there performing oldies shows...showing up in cameos in movies and generally still out there on talk shows. If he died today, I doubt there would have been such a big outpouring of grief for him as there was in 1977. Marlon Brando just died and he was a HUGE icon in movies. If he had died back then, perhaps the same thing would have happened to him as it did with Elvis, James Dean, Monroe and others. As it was, when he died two months ago it was a major story to be sure, but now it's died down. The tributes are over. Elvis' tributes are STILL going on!  As Neil Young said:  "It's better to burn out, then to fade away"

      Here the great George Carlin explains away the Ten Commandments:  Here is my problem with the ten commandments- why exactly are there 10?  You simply do not need ten. The list of ten commandments was artificially and deliberately inflated to get it up to ten. Here's what happened:  About 5,000 years ago a bunch of religious and political hustlers got together to try to figure out how to control people and keep them in line. They knew people were basically stupid and would believe anything they were told, so they announced that God had given them some commandments, up on a mountain, when no one was around.  Well let me ask you this- when they were making this shit up, why did they pick 10? Why not 9 or 11? I'll tell you why- because 10 sound official. Ten sounds important! Ten is the basis for the decimal system, it's a decade, it's a psychologically satisfying number (the top ten, the ten most wanted, the ten best dressed). So having ten commandments was really a marketing decision! It is clearly a bullshit list. It's a political document artificially inflated to sell better. I will now show you how you can reduce the number of commandments and come up with a list that's a little more workable and logical. I am going to use the Roman Catholic version because those were the ones I was taught as a little boy.  Let's start with the first three:    I AM THE LORD THY GOD   THOU SHALT NOT HAVE STRANGE GODS BEFORE ME    THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN    THOU SHALT KEEP HOLY THE SABBATH

      It's Sunday afternoon here. The In-laws are here working on fixing a few things in our house, namely the leaking upstairs shower.  Sundays usually start out bad as it's the big newspaper delivery day. The South-Bend Tribune that I deliver is usually pretty big and Kristen, my wife, has to ride with me to help me deliver. It also gives us time to talk about things.  We hashed it out again today, with me stating my concerns to her that I laid out to everyone in my last post. I guess we're going to work things out as we really have no where else to go. It's either stay together and try to find happiness, or split apart and start over again. We've been married now for thirteen years, so we might as well try to find a middle ground. I'm certainly willing to, despite my venom that I spilled forth in my last blog. I just hope she's willing to try also. But I have to give it time as I'm one of those instant-right-now-change-or-else type of people that has no patience.  Only time will tell. But that seems to be in short supply these days.

      Finally got back to writing to a blog, not that anyone other than myself will read it I'm sure.  Currently I'm living in Berrien Springs, MI. with my wife and son. We've lived in this house now for 3 weeks after my wife, Kristen with the help of her parents, bought it. My credit was and is so bad that I wasn't even on the paperwork so technically it's not my house. While it's a nice house and all, I didn't really want to own a house. For one it's old, so there is a lot of work that needs to be done. But being very good at repair and construction, my Father-in-law has fixed the major problems with the house.  My problem is that I would have been perfectly happy to live in an apartment for the rest of my life. But  everyone  we knew pushed us into buying a house. "You've got to buy a house, you've just got to! All that money you pay in rent is going right out the window. With the same money you pay in rent you could be spending on house payments and then you own the house!" To all this I cry  BULLSHIT . So what, you own a house...what difference does it make if the money is going to a house payment instead of rent? Both areas you're throwing money away! You cannot take either with you when you die. Neither will be practical when you retire. And now everything has to center around the house. Everything.  No more hobbies for you. Everything is centered around the house. My wife's sister has a house too and her hobbies are either working for a newspaper 80 hours a week, or working on her house. That's it. That's her hobbies. Her parents hobbies are working on their house or their daughters houses. That's their hobby (along with line dancing I should also mention). And now, since they've all pushed us into buying a house I suppose they want our hobby to center around the house too. I'm sorry, but I'm not built that way. I could give a rat's ass about this house!  But they don't care. I've become a non-person since I've moved here to Michigan. I used to have a happy life. I had a nice job, was respected in my field (I was a Photoshop guru and Pre-press technician) and lived in an area (Chicago) where I thought I would spend the rest of my life. I had friends there, my wife and son were there and everything was good. Yes, we had money problems, but they were not all due to me. My wife didn't work nor did she look for work.  Now, in March of 2003 she decided that she couldn't stand living in Chicago...that she was tired of always being out of money with bills due and cancellation notices looming everywhere. So instead of the  SANE  solution of getting a fricken job, she instead takes my son and moves back to Mommy and Daddy because she can't handle the big bad world. She rips my son out of school, which is pretty traumatic for a 9 year old, and moves everything that isn't nailed down to St. Joseph, Michigan. She tells me that she's going to set up a life there and that if I want, I could join her and SHE would support us.  Ok, at that point I had two choices. I could have been strong and done the right thing and dumped her ass right there, but I wouldn't have seen my son again because he lived in Michigan and trying to see him would have been near impossible, as I would have been surrounded by people that didn't like me at all. Not the best way to see your son.  OR  I could just quit my job and throw my career (which I had spent the past 10 years making) away. I didn't really have to decide as since my life and mental health were in the dumpster, I couldn't do my job in a proper manner and was let go. I do not blame the place where I worked because they were the nicest people in the world and they had a business to run. I was making mistakes left and right, and it was only a matter of time where I made a major mistake that would have cost the company a lot of money. So I was job-less.  Now, even though I had been let go, I got several offers from other companies when they heard I was out on the market again. They knew I was very difficult to work with, but my work itself and knowledge of Photoshop trumped all that. But I wasn't in any shape to go back to work. I spent all of the summer of 2003 getting drunk and playing on the Internet in a small apartment in Schaumburg...not really knowing where I was going or how I was going to get there.  Around mid-summer 2003 I got my pension check from the union I was a member of. I was getting out of the field and decided to cash in. The check was for $12,000. Again, I had a decision to make. I could have taken that 12 grand and headed west...perhaps settling down in New Mexico and starting a new life. But no, I realized I couldn't live without seeing my son. He was soon to be 10 and I knew I only had a few more years before he started hating me (as most teen boys do with their Fathers). So I decided to move myself to Michigan. My wife didn't want a divorce...or I don't think she did. But she's a pretty weak person (which is why it surprised me that she had the strength to abandon me and move back to Michigan), and I honestly think she was hoping I would ask for a divorce so she could be the poor victim of a brutal husband etc etc. But I didn't. I moved to Michigan in September of 2003.  At my old job I used to be top of the game. I worked for one company that would fly me around the country to set up other shops with servers and stream-line their production. Last job I had I worked on a high-profile client (Keebler) doing Photoshop assemblies and color corrections and even creating original art. But looking back I could see the writing on the wall really as to where the industry was leading...more on that later though. Suffice it to say I was good at what I did and I had self-respect and the respect of others (well, a little respect at least).  What do I do now? I deliver newspapers. Yep, that's it. The pay is pretty good that's for sure, but it's certainly a  HUGE  step down the ladder. But really, it does free me up to do whatever I want to do during the day...though that's not good enough for my wife's family. They want me to go and get a "real" job in addition to the newspaper thing. Yet they said nothing to my wife when she sat around on her ass playing Everquest when we lived in Illinois.  So now that's where I am. I totally and completely hate it here. No, that's not right. Hate is too weak a word. I  LOATH  it here. The only thing that is keeping me alive (that is, keeping me from slashing my wrists...and that's not an exaggeration) is my son. I have no feelings anymore for my wife really. She'll never know how much she ripped my life and my son's life apart to make herself feel happy. She said she would make it up to me, but that's really a pipe dream. As I said before, I've become a non-person. She says she loves me and she smiles and snuggles up to me in bed (and that's it really), but nothing more. She does nothing for me, doesn't go out of her way to do anything nice for me. She didn't even say "happy birthday" or even acknowledge me on my birthday. Yet when her sister or parents have a birthday...well, everything stops and we have to go to dinner and blah blah blah. Now, dear reader you may think that I myself am also to blame...what did I do for her you may ask? On  HER  birthday I bought her a cake, candles, decorated the apartment with happy birthday balloons and banners...I didn't get squat nor even a "happy birthday".  There's so much to get off my chest I don't even know where to begin...I just scratched the surface here. I'm in a place where I have zero friends, I don't know anyone here and I'm surrounded by people that dislike me. Her parents have  NEVER  liked me and it's been made worse since all this happened. They don't listen to anything I have to say nor take any advice in the areas where I know a little. I'm just a joke to them all. My wife has a huge support system with her family here but I have nothing. I have no one to turn to, no where to go. I am on nobody's side because nobody is on my side. The only refuge I have now is drinking myself into a stupor to where I don't have to deal with anything.  Basically I'm 42 years old now and am just waiting to die. I'm about 150 pounds overweight and I drink almost daily...so death is just around the corner for me.
