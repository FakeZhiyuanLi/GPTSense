      Lunch with Ivy, Dave B. and Kristine. Very nice and full, and yet, I'm still craving the chocolate cream pie I got Ivy for her going away. I just caught a whiff of my very interesting breath--a result of lunch. Hmm. Might need some gum and/or peppermint tea for that one.  Also, I may have to wash this shirt as soon as I get home to avoid a faint stain directly over my nipple area from my salad dressing.  I need to start posting pics in my blogs. Oh hey. It's 3 o'clock already. Pie time. Catch ya later, bitches.

      OK, there are literally 5 important things that I should be doing right now, but I absolutely cannot focus.  I ate too much Panda Express for lunch and have been battling my food coma bravely ever since.  Must keep eyes open--at least to maintain the appearance of consciousness.   Randy had a job interview today.  Keep your fingers crossed.  Say little prayers and burn a candle at both ends, just to be safe.

      Feeling a little on the blah side this morning. Hoping my self-made green tea latte will help. At least the sugar in the honey is kind of perking me up.  Oh yes, good news...Leslie said I could take of my two days in November to go to Hawaii. Woo hoo! The quintessential American beach vacation soon will be mine! Meredith, NY Lisa, Ilana and I soon will be lounging around on our surfboards with our jackeritas in hand, drunk and happy. I can't wait.  Here's a cute e-mail from my lil sis, Heidi, who is now working as a dental hygenist at a pediadentist's office:     hey lisa i thought about you today. this little girl was about 7 and she was you about 17 years ago. she spoke the same way you did with that heavy tongue and was so damn talkative. i couldn't believe there was another out there. ;) she wanted to switch all her prizes for another with an explanation for each one, (it was at work today). she kinda had your look too, at that age, except she was blonde. i just giggled to myself and wanted to share the coincidence with everyone, but no one would understand. she was so cute. well love you and see you soon. bye heidi        Yay! Lisa-clones rock!    So, Heidi's bridal shower is coming up and I'm really struggling to think what to get her. I'm sure I'll come up with something clever and ridiculous at the same time. I'll have to browse good ol' Amazon.com. Hmm...feel free to post suggestions.  OK, this is me getting back to work. P.S. Thanks, Kris Jones and Tracey for posting comments! I feel so loved!

      So it's Monday, folks, which means that you get a recap of my weekend, which is always fun since I have two whole days of stories stored up in my lumpy noggin'.   Friday night.  One word. Two syllables. "Awesome." Kris Jones came over, bearing flavored fizzy water and a cute baby watermelon. We provided the pizza, brownies and "Spellbound" DVD. Good times. The only thing we didn't do, that we should have done, was crank-call people we know. I shall remember to do that next time.   Saturday night.  Poker at Wendy Isbell's. If you see Wendy, please tease her about trying to set me up with a guy whom she thought I would like based solely on the fact that he is ASIAN and NOT SHORT. Thanks, folks. No more applause. Really. I can not make this stuff up. In any case, I had a great time. $20 at Wendy's house buys you poker lessons, all the cheese sticks, Jack Daniels and Dr. Pepper you can consume and that's all right by me.   Sunday night . OK, this one is a little more difficult to explain. In fact, I'm still trying to figure it out myself. Needless to say (my favorite substitute for the expression, "In any case"), I shall explain more as I find out what the hell is going on. All you need to know is that I ate a ton of sushi all day long and watched lots of the Olympics. Alexander Popov! The "Russian Rocket"! Did you miss me, Alex?  Later, peeps.

      Hungry, hungry hippo--that is me. I think I may splurge and order something for breakfast. Something sandwich-y. Or, I could just eat my sushi in the fridge. Hmm...this will require some serious thought.  Trivia night at "The Shack" in Santa Monica last night with Sam and Sora. We won 3rd place, with a little help from me with my "entertainment" knowledge. It's been a long time since I hung out with people who call UGA "Georgia" and Georgia Tech "Tech." Ah, Georgia...I can't seem to stay away from you for more than 2 months at a time this year.  Listening to Willie Nelson lately. Decided that I need to go on a pilrimage to Texas with Randy to see him play live. I feel like I remember seeing a documentary that mentions some bar that he likes to go to and play all the time. I need to do some more research on that. Duly noted...  I always find it very curious when I wake up in the morning, sore from absolutely nothing. Makes me wonder what happened in my sleep. I remember that in one of my dreams, my underwear had a hole in the side of it and I remember being very annoyed.  Time to get to work and all that jazz.  Random thought before I go, someone said that my fingers were so big, they looked like dildos. With that image in mind, imagine me doing "jazz hands."

      Now, this doesn't mean that Lisa Land is dead...she's just in a coma after being run over with a semi.  At some point, she will reawaken and try to reintigrate herself into normal life.  However, many hours of physical therapy will be required.  Until then, I offer you my humble blog.   Phooey to all you hateful boys.  You know who you are.     Trader Joe's sushi for lunch.  Yum-a-yum-yum.  And an ice cream social afterwards.  Food-wise, it has been a good day.  Trying not to be so lethargic all the time.  Too much sleep or too little.  Never just right.  The page count on my latest script is 45 pages.  I'm really digging it.  Unearthing lots of angry Lisa Demons who would otherwise wail angrily in my head and belly.  (How Greek mythology of me...)  Trying to be a good girl and finish up this project before I try to start another.   Melissa Little is leaving me and moving down to the 6th floor with Elimidate, which sucks tremendously.  No more impromptu meetings while I wait for the caffeine-high to die down and complain to her about my various gripes.  Sigh.  Maybe this means something...  Well, maybe I'll post more later...for now....ta-ta!
