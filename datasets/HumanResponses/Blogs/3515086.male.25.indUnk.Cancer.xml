      June 21, 2004 SPAIN V PORTUGAL Good for Euro that Portugal won  The Iberian peninsula was divided this morning.    The feelings of relief and joy flooding Luis Figo is evident after teammate Nuno Gomes scored Portugal's goal. -- AP  And little brother Portugal pulled the carpet from under the feet of their respected neighbours Spain to clinch a quarter-final place in soccer's Euro 2004.  The Portuguese capital of Lisbon was the venue. And you can imagine what the pressure was on the host.  Teetering on the brink of elimination after they shockingly lost the first game - 1-2 to Greece - all sorts of visions enveloped the Portuguese side.  Coach Luis Felipe Scolari, the man who steered Brazil to the last World Cup crown, was wondering whether he would be sacked.  Skipper Luis Figo was worried about whether his international swansong would be soaked in ignominy.  But the team that once boasted the best striker in the world in Eusebio in the Sixties, fought back in grand style.  Prior to this game, they beat Russia 2-0. And boosted by that success, they downed the country that boasted the best league in the world - in the Primera Liga - by the narrowest of margins. It was enough to give them a place in the last eight.  Nuno Gomes was the toast of Portugal after scoring what would be termed the face-saving, survival-mattering wonder goal that shocked Spain.  The Benfica striker, introduced at half-time as a substitute for Pauleta, struck the decisive blow in the 57th minute with a powerful low shot from 20 metres.  Spain needed only a draw and were twice denied an equaliser by the woodwork as they went down to their first ever defeat by the hosts in a competitive match.   Joining Portugal in the last eight were Greece, who advanced on the strength of having scored more goals than the Spanish, despite going down 2-1 to Russia in Faro in their final Group A match.  If the first half was played at a fast pace, the second was frenetic as both sides played attacking soccer in the search for goals.  And there was action galore. Fernando Torres headed Xabi Alonso's corner fractionally over for Spain and, a minute later, Cristiano Ronaldo outjumped the Spanish defence only to send his glancing header wide of the upright.   Spain's goalkeeper Iker Casillas, the Real Madrid custodian, was called upon to make a save from Benfica full-back Miguel after 20 minutes.  Then Raul, the Real Madrid striker, was centimetres away from connecting with an attempt as the ball skidded across Portugal's goalmouth and was let down by a poor first touch on the second.  But Spain's hopes were dashed when Gomes twisted and turned on the edge of the Spanish box and struck a low shot into the bottom corner of the net.   The Jose Alvalade stadium, home to Benfica's arch rivals Sporting Lisbon, erupted into celebrations.  And although Costinha missed a sitter in the dying minutes, no one bothered as the wild celebrations continued on the pitch and on the stands.  It was a sad exit for Spain, whom many expected to enter the semi-finals. But the Nearly Men of world soccer would have to concede that Portugal deserved the win.  The pressure on the host was high. As Figo admitted: 'The pressure was huge. But we have to be really proud at the way we played.'  And if there was one cue from Portugal to world soccer superpowers Italy and Germany, who are struggling with two draws each, it is that no mission is impossible.  Only Spain may not agree with that. But then it was good that the hosts remained in the competition. For Euro 2004's sake.
