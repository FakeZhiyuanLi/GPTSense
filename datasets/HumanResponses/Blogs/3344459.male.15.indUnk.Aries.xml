      Today I went to church at 9:00, and that was un eventful. Nicholas gave me a ride there, so that was cool. I have a new found respect for him; regardless of how fricken retarded he can act, he's hella-smart and we share the same views on alot of the same subjects.  There was a bouncy house that the church rented! It RAWKded! I felt all fat and sluggish when I couldnt get up the slide part the first time, but i took off the socks and BAM (sound effects were actually there this time) i could do it! Joy! so that was cool...  Wurk is wurk... so meh... Im gonna buy a PS2 next week hopefully wif my monies frum teh wurk! Then an Xbox so i can buy Halo and Halo2!!! (when H2 DOES come out)  ------  I think i have projects i didnt do due tomorrow... wow! i bet that was almost semi-difficult to understand!  BYEBYE!

      First off, a funny convo i had with Nicholas JUST now   I play tuba07: i havent gotten anything down on paper, but its in the thought process I play tuba07: thing Elf0004: ah, i was there for a while I play tuba07: yea I play tuba07: heres the thing... im "afraid" to offend anyone with my beliefs and opinion Elf0004: by "anyone" you mean the congragation? I play tuba07: more or less I play tuba07: more my mom Elf0004: why, you offend me everytime you talk?   Just as an update, I now work at Smoothie King!!! Wo0t!1!1!11!one!!!1 It rawks having a job! I can buy my own stuff now, without mom bitching about money. I plan on buying the God of all guitars, a Les Paul *drools on self*. Im also gonna buy a bigger amp... WITH WHEELS!!!! YAY!!! My Behringer is just too heavy to lug around all the time, so wheels and size does matter.  I had Band Banquet last night, and it went alot better than I thought it would. Mike brought Callie as his date and I, of course, brought the lovely Katie. So Katie and Callie danced while Mike and I took pictures of people being cute. Katie said that I got more pictures of her in one night than her mom has gotten of her in her whole life (thats alot of hers, u notice?) I had alot of fun, and it seems like Katie did too. I sure hope so.  I have this COA service planning thingy-bop 2morrow morning... I cant decide wheter to be happy or pissed that i have to get up early. Doesnt matter, I'm always up at, what, 8 anyway, so I'm not THAT pissed. I need to start writing my Credo... thats gonna be a bitch...  Boston is gonna kick SO much ass! That or really suck... I hope its the first one, though, cuz it's the only fun i'll have all summer!   Cant think of anything else to say  Laterz -Management

      Well, I have come to realize that my life is somewhat empty without a journal, so I yet again start a new one! I can never commit to these things though, so maybe if you bug me I'll update more often in those long periods of time when i dont update.  Band Banquet tonight! I'm really excited, because all of my band friends will finally get to meet Katie!  I love my Katie so much!  ill post laterz

      The things that irritate me are far and few between, Nicholas. However, when I DO find something that makes me frustrated, you seem to dismiss it thinking it should go straight into my personal blog. This in itself makes me angry, and I rarely get mad. If the blog is here for our thoughts and feelings, then I will use it to any extent I wish. Unless you and Jesse veto my update. Then I will get rid of it.  Two things. 1. Its raining, so therefore I am happy 2. Some guy came into our school and we had to go into lock-down mode! It rawkd!  END!!!!

      At first, me being who I am, I was outraged that Nicholas would DARE to defy my word, but then came to realize he is completely right. But please excuse me if I feel like informing you on weird or out-of-the-ordinary things I do on a daily basis. And from now on, you can kiss my ass if you don't like my post. That said, I now move on to my next subject. --- As I now have a job, it is difficult to have a social life on weekends. For instance, this Saturday Jesse is having a Blue Man party, but I have work until 9:00pm. This also intervenes on my band practice. Point being, my weekends are fucked, and that pisses me off. --- This school year is now coming to a close, leaving me to ponder some things. One thought I had today is "Why are there so many non-band members joining the flag corps?". Scary, isn't it? It really gives me a reason o call them flaggots (flag + faggots = flaggots[this name suits them so very, very well]).   I was forced to return my Tuba to Mac today... Rolling a tuba in a tuba case across Macarthur is not an easy task, I might add. It makes you hot n' sweaty!!! --- Boston in two weeks...   *note    whenever I place a '---' that means I have just changed subjects. Just thought I would let the readers know.

      The school year is coming to an end, and in some respects, I wish it wasn't.  I mean, yeah, it's gonna be great that we don't have school or gorilla or homework for a while, but... you always lose touch with people over the summer, you know? Like, those you don't ever have any contact with when you're not in that class with them.  Since it seems to be human nature to not go outside anymore, and since noone lives close to eachother, you can't go and do stuff, unless you plan it over the internet or aim.  Of course, it's also doubtful I'll be able to see any of my friends who happen to be girls over the summer, because I've noticed the bulk of Irving's population's behavior, which entails thinking that everything you say is implying something, then taking that something and stretching it WAY out of proportion, nothing works. You can't say "hey, _______, wanna go see troy?" because everyone would just think you were going on a date, even if you weren't**, and the whole thing would be ruined.  Sure, there's AIM, and I'm grateful for that, but I get tired of reading text sometimes. Even though in truth you're talking to another person, sometimes you just need a voice to hear, so you know... you feel less alone.  I guess I've talked about all I need to for tonight, I hope I can find somewhere to go, or something to do, because I really need it right now.  **especially not with me, if you take one look at me in school or something, you'll probably figure I'm not the kind of guy who gets to go on many dates...

      ok, this is to inform the greater public at large, but apperently Dustin needs this also.  i have creadted this in my limited wisdom and if any of the members disagree feel free to voice it.  The purpose of this site is as a informational posting ground for a number of things: One, the bashing, insulting, or ranting about stupid people affecting our lives(this does not include blatent rascim, sexism, pointless hating, or insuling other members of the blog, and plz keep the monotheists bashing to a minimum, there have enough troubles being wrong with out us telling them all the time).  Two, to inform on matters of video games, for example if anyone ever find any cool sites about games, or important info such as a  real  realse date for Halo2 of Half-Life 2 that would go here.  Three, reviews for games movies or anything else that you want to give your opinion on to the greater public.  Four, discussing the inherent goodness of pie, and the act of making pudding from jello mix.  These are the set purpose of this blog,  IT IS NOT A PERSONAL BLOG  we all have our own blogs to post on and ones such as the one made by Dustin on the twentith belong there.  If anyone would like to make an amendant or a clarification on this mission statement, feel free to do so or to ask about it, this is just me, if Dustin or Jesse want to mess with it, we can talk about it, but the recten post on the twenty-third sparked in my mind that a misunderstanding or purpose existed, i hope this clears it up. ~Elf0004

      i dont understand people. thats a rather broad statement, let me clarify.  people have the strange disillsion that there is a set way to behave, and that not following that patteren of behavior, is "uncool".  The group that most closely follows these charateristics, is the "in crowd".  The people that dont meet their standards of "cool" are outcast and labeled; Goths, Geeks, Nerds, Stoners, and more... but then on top of that, the out casts groups dont like each other either, everyone hates everyone who isnt the same group as them.  They all have names for eachother, and reasons, and excuses, but what they dont have, and dont seem to want is sympathy.  People are every day being insulted and bashed for reasons that they dont really have control over, because they didnt make to sports team they aren't "jocks" and thus are a "looser".  Because they want to make somthing out of there lives and not do poorly  in school, they cant be "in" and are a "nerd".  But what is worse, in my opinion at least, is if they try to chage the person that they are, so that they can fit in with the people who they wan to be.  Because they know so much about computers and stuff, they become "geeks".  But if they try to change them selves, then that is changeing who they are, and doing that will enevitably make them regret who they were, and quite possibly hate themsleves.  There is a term for that addapted by the "goth" and other groups that i feel applies quite well for thoes kinds of people, "conformist". If anyone can offer me some insite in the depths of reason behind this kind of thing, would they plz help me to understand.   oh, and one more thing, can someone explain to me why people think im gay?  apperently its a widely held opinion.. at least among the fucks at my school.  or at least it according to my ex-girlfriend, but shes an idiot, so it doesnt matter that much i guess... night then

ShuChoMouf: and satan laughed so hard his horns turned into jello I play tuba07: *GASP* I play tuba: NOT JELLO ShuChoMouf: and then he cried because jello is an absolute good, therefore satan couldnt eat it I play tuba: u know, i can make pudding out of jello gelatin mix ShuChoMouf: i know, i know ShuChoMouf: i have some gelatin mix I play tuba: only on wednesdays, though ShuChoMouf: i thought it was thursdays!

      I got back from Boston yesterday, and it was pretty cool. For the first 4 days Katie was being mean to me... But then she was suddenly nice on the last full day. That made me so happy...  I was thinking it was going to not be as nearly cool as I thought it was going to be but, DAMN, was I wrong. I like the city! It's cool beans!!! I really   Blue Man... oh my god... so awesome... loved it... cant stop thinking about it! The spin painting they made was cool. Even more-so because i BOUGHT IT. Boo-yah! Just goes to show you that i CAN do something better than Jesse ~Shakes fist in air~. I can see why Jess   ...  Me... Nobody understood it though. Like when they're playing and then the band is supposed to come in, but they dont and they look confused. Nobody got that! I was very offended! Stoopid non-Blue Man fans...  Thats all for now!

      Ok, so I went to see it this afternoon, and I thought it was pretty good, so heresy the review:  the beginning has our hero Peter Parker experiencing a dramatic decline in the quality of his life, in living his double life as Spiderman was sapping away all his time, he was fired from his job, and was flunking in collage, and wasn't even making the rent from his pictures.  At his surprise b-day party we are reacquainted with his friends, the rich kid Harry and his romantic interest Mary-Jane.  The seemingly final straw in his life as Spiderman conflicting with his life as Peter is when he misses the a performance of MJ's play, and she is very upset with him and when is powers begin to fail on him he gives up his life as Spiderman and Peter Parker's life greatly improves.  He does well in school and finally makes it to MJ's play, and everything seems to be going better, except Harry wont let up with his vengeance of killing Spiderman as pay-back for his fathers death.  Once he learns that MJ is getting married, he crumbles again, soon a time comes when he realizes that he must be the friendly-neabiorhood-Spiderman.  It was both an action and a romance, but the sappy stuff was worth it to see Spidy get his ass handed to him by a six-armed villain.  All in all, you should see this movie, but don't stay till the end, there isn't anything special, I waited and found nothing, thanks.

      Okay, so none of us have been updating this lately, and that makes me kinda sad... We need to get back into this, people1!!11!!  --- So I ditched my old band, Fatal Error, because we had nothing going. Our keyboardist didnt have a keyboard, our drummer was a stoner, and my other guitarist moved away. Yeah... doesnt that suck? So now im starting one up with Jesse (my awesome little percussionist), Eric (The not-so-little bassist), Me (Sexiest guitarist on the planet earth), and maybe Matt (another guitar) but he kinda doesnt like me because of the whole "Lesa" ordeal. DAMN YOU WOMEN!!! I had this idea for an instrument for Jesse. So far I call it "The Station" because it's stationary (that means it dont move [or with difficulty]). Its like the Blue Man tubulum, but it will the hitting tube part thing infront of him with two toms on either side. The tubes lead up over his head, and just sit there. It's a good idea! Jesse says so! Damnit! --- I am soon going to be painting my room!!! Joy!!! Im gonna force Jesse to come over, and im gonna TRY to get Blanton to come over to help paint it. Yeah... it's gonna rock1!11!! I want to put a silhoette of my guitar on my wall, and then paint inside the name of the band. That would be neato! --- I just destroyed the whole purpose of this blog by putting in these updates, didnt I? Eh... oh well. If you have a problem with it you can STFU!1!11!!!
