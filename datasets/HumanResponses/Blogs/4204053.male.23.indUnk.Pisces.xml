      It was a "kings game" all weekend where drinking and partying was guaranteed. Where the sites sooth your eyes through eye candy. To top everything, having the sun coat its warm rays over ya, turning everyone's skin to my favorite color of rum, Gold. What a weekend! I went to Wasaga with my French buddies to meet others friends who rented a beach cottage. Ten to fifteen people were expected to stay over for the "FIN DE SEMAIN". We were all so excited from all the stories we've herd from friends. The chicks, the beers, the sand and the weather, ah... We had an image of this foreign paradise that was actually in Ontario. Contradiction, maybe but we were soon to discover it. Arnie, The Rock, Benois AKA: Jelly Bean and I arrived to a beautiful sunset with a warm tropical breeze. I was just hoping that the rest would live up to our imaginations. Well...life some times beats the shit out of imagination. The cottage was patchy, the stove didn't work, the white sink was hanging by one screw and not to mention, the rest of the cottage was smaller than originally described. None of us were disappointed though. We really wanted to get away from the “Rat Race” of city life. We would take what ever we got. As we spoke to people they told us that drinking hadn't stop since that morning and we had a lot to catch up to. I emerged from the drunkenness to become the cook of the weekend. Since the stove was broken I was basically had to cook every thing on the barbecue. The job description: must be creative, drunk and innovative. Check this out; I cooked bacon and hash browns on a barbecue. I impressed myself. Dame right! That night the chef served ribs and burgers. Once the other group of friends arrived the third round of drinking started. There was a "sheshaw??" their and we smoked flavored tobacco all weekend. Early that mo0rning after I went for a swim we played soccer, had a few drinks then went to bed around 7am. I had the honor of waking everyone. Which became an agonizing experience. Hopping on an air mattress and threatening to stick a barbecue lighter up people Asses. I wish I took some pics of their faces! We drank as we sun tanned on the beach and swam on an off through the day. What else could we want? Eh ... Ladies... the eye candy, the full spectrum of smarties, you could never get tired of scoaping them out. From time to time we fished while trying to avoid all the sharks. We caught some times... The rest of the days were filled of walking, checking out chicks, talking trying to pick up, drinking, eating, drinking and some more drinking. Oh yah, partying at night. The Highlights of the trip all started with Jelly Bean, Benois, puking on himself while wearing my coat then sleeping with it. Let me tell ya a little something about Jelly Bean. His real name is Benois.This guy looks like Mr. Bean and has a truly innocent playful charisma that emanates from every thing he does. This five foot five, brown haired Houdini has a vanishing act that mesmerizes you. He disappears from our group like sand tossed in to a crashing wave. You know his near but nowhere in sight. Then emerges hours later even more hammered, but this is the thing, he doesn't remember what he did. We end up walking with him the next day and people are yelling Benny! Ben! It’s sort of like the movie "dude where's my car". The second being we were always the last people partying every night! At 5 am totally hammered I would walk out side on the soft cold white sand. Allowing the astonishment of how deserted and quite the beach was. I would remember just a few hours before the place was squirming with people. The only bright lights around were glowing from our beach cottage. The music was still pulsating like a lighthouse alerting the passing of the nearest celebration. Lights slowly dimmed allowing a new page of to turn. Third, is what I call smack down! I went for a stroll with a Sami's cousin and she ends up talking about wrestling. I'm not talking about the moushy type or the WWE type, the real wrestling. Well to make a story short she showed me a move that I never would have expected it to work. She basically flips me on my back really HARD. Well **** I was stunned not once but twice. I have to say ... I like when a women that take charge, but for your info, I did take over that match after the second SMACK down. Definitely aHighlight! Finally, the partying and the characters that make the show worthwhile, from Jelly Bean to The free verse guy to The Rock to the “high time guys” and we can't forget the chicks! No really the spotlight was always on the amount of hot broads their, ****! I couldn't believe it. Wasaga rocks hard! Until the next time... party hard!
