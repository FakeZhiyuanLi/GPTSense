      I just want to put this post out there in the universe for two people, my dear Sabby who I have lost touch with and my dear friend the Sheriff. They have both broken my heart, but today I thought about them as they are both stubborn Taurus bulls born about a week apart and this day separates their birthday's equally. I last saw Sabby on her birthday last year at a breakfast he boyfriend organized and I showed up, sprained ankle and all with my current "boyfriend" at the time that she despised. In a way, my love for him affected quite a few of my female relationships, both good and bad but I guess love does that to all your other relationships. It is a test to see who is left standing after something powerful has moved through your life. If a home falls apart after a hurricane, you don't move into a similar home and wait for the same effect to take place? I am sorry I have not seen or heard from Sabby, but I love her none the less and I pray she is happier than when we last left.  And now on to the Sheriff. I guess you could call him my first love, a few came before him but those loves were more of a brotherly love as time went on. The Sheriff swept me off my feet, older, handsome, educated, home owner, financially stable, car owner, independent, funny as hell, sarcastic, witty, and even loved to cook. Is there anything else any woman in the world is looking for? I was a naive recent high school grad who thought, wow this is what it is like to envision your life with someone else. Before him all men were stupid and good only for what they could do for me. In the 6 years that I dated before him, I never thought relationships were good for anything. Boys were toys for me, something to keep me busy and something to show off to my friends. My sheriff was different. Did I mention he carried a firearm - legally? Excitement to boot!!Once the sheriff realized he was a king and I was a little girl he was playing games with, he ripped out my heart and put it in jail along with the convicts he locked up ona regular basis. I discovered later he had a penchant for PYT's - pretty young things. The letters in horrible english from broken hearted school girls were proof enough. The guys at his station got a kick out of that. A year later, I plotted my revenge and conquered his best friend and partner. A year after that we decided to stop hurting each other and became real friends. No sex, just good company and dependability - everything you could want in a friend. I thank him for the lessons he taught me about love and men. His pain allowed me to build a wall which would not be broken for another 5 years. He is the man I have called when ex boyfriends got locked up, friends have car trouble, I am stuck in Harlem at 3:00 a.m., I need a few hundred to hold me over, I want someone in the city to go to lunch with, and any other thing that comes to mind. I always think once I get off the phone with him after thanking him for yet another favor, "Does he still feel guilty from 1996". It doesn't matter. He does it with no sweat off his back. So thanks to my sheriff for always being a friend. I can't say that about most of the shitty men in my life.   Happy Birthday Sabby and Sheriff. Damn yall getting old!

      So I am coming in from work (I actually did some work today!) check the mail box and low and behold I see a hand written letter addressed to me from "Durham Correctional Facility"!!! I never get actual mail - when you are my age EVERYTHING is like Beyonce sang - Bills, Bills, Bills. Immediately I run down a mental list of some of the memorable southern brothers I used to roll with in my days of pimpin. I consider myself a cute girl, well dressed, born and raised NY'er and I have a lil bootyliciousness going on so needless to say, I was very popular with the home grown thugs of VA, NC, SC, DC, etc. I was attracted to how easy they are and the flash of the lifestyle. I would go check my best girl who moved to VA when she was 14, hit the mall and within minutes we had guys taking us on shopping sprees and out to eat. There is not much else to do down there and truth be told, southeners are a little slow.  By freshman year in college, I had one guy named Corey sending me plane tickets every other week so he could see me. He would book me a room at the local Sheraton and we would spend the weekend at the local mall, bars and of course my favorite - the go-cart track! That was one of the few things I looked forward to during my freshman year at NYU. I actually thought it was cute that I had this guy attached to me like puppy who wants to play. After a while I realized dating a guy in the fast lane was not for me. Long periods alone waiting for them to "handle business", never knowing their phone number or address or real name, constantly feeling like people are watching you. After a while I would pick fights with him to be done with the situation. He would send me cards begging me to come back. He said he thought I was the one because after all, he always wanted a NY chick and he finally had one, or so he thought. I felt guilty when he started to catch feelings. He had no idea I was in it for the money (that and it made my boyfriend in NY very jealous). I guess I have always been addicted to something, shopping is my vice and clothes and shoes are my drugs of choice. Guys use women for sex before they grow up (some never do!), women use men for other things (father figure, material goods,etc.) before we realize what relationships are all about.  Well by now you must know this letter I speak of is from Corey. He tells me he found God and actually apologized for everything we went through back when we were dating. I guess you don't realize how memorable you are to the people in your past until they pop up in ways like this. Although I have always been unlucky in love, I guess I have always been remembered judging by the calls I get from men of my past. See what happens when you keep the same cell number and address for years! Just when I thought I put my foolish, childish ways far behind me, there it is in your mailbox one day. I have no choice but to write him back. I am glad I have moved past those days. I am sorry it took him a trip to the pen to do the same thing.

      Today, I heard one of the best things I could hear from a woman at an event. She was a senior associate at a mid-sized CT firm focused on IP law and she told me she had found home life/work life balance. She actually told me she was happy. She had time for her husband and her kids and managed to bill enough to probably make partner next year. I thought to myself - wow there is hope for my friend. She recently graduated from Columbia Law and is nervous about joining a firm. Heck, her live-in lawyer boyfriend (they met at Columbia is already looking to leave his firm. Can women have great careers, make loads of money, have kids and gain weight, get skinny again, meet a hot successful guy and keep him all in one life??? I can't even give my one year old puppy and my senior dog (pictures to come) all the attention I would like, and I try to stick to no more than 8 hours a day. Know a woman who has it all, I mean really has it all. Not some crappy job or some half ass man - I am a Leo, we don't settle. Hot bod, great job she loves, good work-out schedule, juggles a man (or men :o), kids, home, etc. Tell me her story. I want to see a schedule of how she does it. Maybe I could learn something about my schedule habits. It would be best to learn now, because when I get older I can't imagine it getting any easier. This gets me empathizing with Trish on the Bachelor. I know she is an uber bitch, but think about it - she is just a woman looking to get it all.

      Everyone knows that all the Bunim Murray shows are taped and edited ready for broadcast long before we meet the cast. So why does MTV decide to throw you a loop every now and then and not play a new episode every week. I am kind of pissed there was no new episode last night, so I have to rant. In other news, I was thinking about the cast they have in San Diego now and wondering how long it will take Robin and Cameron to take it off for playboy. Trishelle did it (we expected that), Arissa did it (she's a rapper now, its required), heck even Katie did it (no explanation there). I am taking bets. We still have time because we won't hear about them until the show is complete.  Well today is one of those nice days where I don't have to keep a boring 9-5 schedule. This is one of the perks of my job. I woke up at 10:00, walked my dogs, cooked breakfast ( I don't cook, Atkins is forcing me to - boiled eggs are not as hard as I thought) and I will be hitting the gym later. I'll come back, shower and hop on a 4:00 p.m. Acela to check into a nice hotel and order up every meat on the menu (heck its on the firm).  One more reason MTV sucks before I go - it's hip hop week on MTV. Why is Beyonce's naughty girl video on the countdown. Last time I checked, hip hop and R&B are two different genres. I am praying I never have to hear B flowin' on a track. And no Beyonce, attending Beanie Seagel's murder trial on Friday does not make you an honorary Hip Hop artist. I'm out!

      I admit it. I am a reality TV slut. But the excitement is seeing how stupid will make themselves look on TV, I don't need the suspense of knowing what will happen next week. So with that in mind, I was able to dig up some dirst on the Inferno final episodes. Next to the inferno for the ladies is Kendall vs. Leah. As the commercials have been foreshadowing, the Real World team wants Leah gone and we she heads to the inferno against Kendall, Kendall is the one that returns to her team. Despite their bickering while on the treadmills during the inferno in which Katie wins, before leaving the Inferno compound, Julie pens a letter to Katie with a keychain in it and tells her to be strong and use that keychain for her new car keys. Timmy gets to the letter before Katie and takes it and reads it. With Katie as the unoffical Real World mascot, The Real World team conspires with Katie to pay her $40k if she screws up her team to help Real World win the finale. She contemplates it but surprisingly does not bite and the Road Rules once again wins a challenge. If anyone has any details they would like to post about this show or other reality shows, please post a comment or shoot me an e-mail at bitchinbuttercup@yahoo.com. Gotta run. Sopranos is coming on!

      I first heard about blog skins and instantly thought about Tribe Calld Quest who used the term skins to be synonomous with sex or getting laid. So my initial visual image was of my blog bonin' some other blog. Interesting.... Anyway, now I know the truth - blog skins can change the appearance of my blog, so now I just need to know how to use them. Any assistance to help a new inexperienced blogger would be appreciated.

      Well my boss has been off in Nevis since Tuesday and it seems everyone has decided to make my life hell at work while he has been gone. First Tokyo partner called - he is the devil incarnate. He always has a meeting like yesterday and always wants a firm brochure - which we don't have! Then you spend hours preparing materials for him and customizing it only to have him continue to change his mind until he ends up approving something that looks vaguely familiar - almost identical to the presentation you last prepared for him! Asshole. I handled Tokyo partner with relative ease. Then some other partner decides they have a meeting on Tuesday and need a folder. They figured, I told your boss Brian, let's not reinvent the wheel - can we get him on the phone? Uh, no Mr. Important partner. Brian is in Nevis. I don't think your folders qualify as an emergency situation worth phoning Nevis for. Handled Mr. Important Partner with ease as well. Then the unthinkable happens. The acutal work I did this week that is part of my job description gets screwed up because the IT guy oversleeps with his new baby and shows up late to start the presentation. Oh, yeah senior boss, that's all my fault because I forgot to call him this morning to get him up and drive him in to work. So now we are going to trial so we can see where to put Blame. I say Blame is part of the IT dept., but they want to beleive that Blame is my co-worker. There is no one named Blame in my dept. So that is how we get to the title - I am job hunting. Just sniffing out opportunity, not making any moves yet. I can't wait to fill my boss in so he can tell me his opinion.

      This is my first post on my new blog. I kept doing random searches for cool designer clothes like Louis Verdad and Ella Moss and discovered them on other people's blogs who had discussed them. Last night I just decided, I had to have one. So being true to my impulsive self - here I am! I am trying to figure out how I am going to balance my online time between shopping and my new blog which I hope to update a few times a week at least. For any strangers out there checking me out, I am a NY'er born and raised, prep school educated and gainfully employed by one of the largest law firms in the US as an events manager. I love my job - probably because they pay me just enough to buy new shoes every month and shop whenever I want. My doorman is best friends with the mailman and UPS because of me. I love to shop but hate stores - the internet is where it's at. No nasty sales clerks, no lines, no carrying bags and sometimes NO TAX. A big deal here in NY where tax is a whopping 8.625%. I must go to work in the morning so I am going to bed now, but I'll be back once I figure out how to post links, pictures, etc. If anyone had any tips on how to make my blog more personalized please shoot me an e-mail at bitchinbuttercup@yahoo.com.

      Well, my birthday is coming up in approx. two months. Since people never know what to get me, I thought I would start a wish list of things that I would LOVE. Here is the first entry. These are available on neimanmarcus.com and I would need a 9 since they don't have an 8.5. If you need my ship-to address, just shoot me an e-mail.  urlLink

      I am not sure if I have 99 problems, but Jay-Z has one. As much as I LOVE the Brooklyn born rapper, I was very disappointed to learn that Jay-Z took that song as well as the catchy chorus from none other than Ice-T. Why Jay, why?? Anyway, people with problems usually like to share them. Suddenly problems weigh less if you fill other people in on the details. Below are some of my problems. Feel free to hit me with comments on your own problems.  1. I can't lose 30 pounds to save my life (so what, I want to weigh 110).  2. I can't seem to get a tiny Naomi Campbell butt to save my life. 3. I can't stop buying shoes. 3. I have no place to put any new shoes out of reach from my shoe loving dog. 4. The only two men I have ever loved don't want to be with me. 5. Both my dogs have the "runs". 6. "Restructuring" at my job has created chaos at work where I once had harmony. 7. I can't afford to see my shrink anymore because I buy expensive shoes. 8. I have been priced out of the condo/co-op market in NY. 9. I went to Saks the other day to buy make-up and despite dropping $187, the sales folks were still shady. 10. My dog bit me again today.

      Well I decided to start writing about each of my match dates as soon as they are over, so I can look back and see how I felt initially after meeting someone. Those first set of dates were not worthy of write ups, so I plan to forget anyone who completely sucks. If you are a guy I have gone out with and have discovered my blog w/o me giving you the URL, what you read on this blog, stays on the blog.   Back to the story...Tonight, I went out with a fireman. Very cute, tall, nice body, works out, SWM, 31 years old, no kids, lives alone. We had a very simple date. He picked me up and we went to Mo's in Fort Greene and spoke for 3 hours over 2 drinks each. He was very easy to converse with and very funny. On the way to dropping me off, He showed me his apartment which was really nice. He is a really neat guy who definitely cooks and knows how to keep his place clean. We played an interesting game of truth or dare so we got to learn a lot about each other and capped of our date with a kiss. He is definitely someone I want to see again. I'll let you know how Fireman Date #2 turns out.

      I see the traffic my blog has been getting as of late. I know where you are, your ISP, your OS, how you got here, what you search for, and for some of you, I even know exactly who you are. Here is my question for the readers, where are the comments. I didn't add the extra code from  urlLink Haloscan  for my health. So if you see something that interests you or you disagree with (most people disagree with everything I say or vice versa), by all means speak your mind. That is what the comments section is for after all. Don't be shy, HOLLA BACK!

      Ladies, get those dresses and heels out, fleet week has hit the city! The majority of the men in uniform will be staying at the Embassy Suites Hotel, 102 North End Avenue which is downtown Manhattan so expect to see lots of fellas hanging out in Chevy's. Other good locations to check out the "sites", i.e., men in uniform include A&M Roadhouse, Jay-Z's spot 40/40, and the Copa. With the weather report no longer reading rain, I hope everyone has a fun safe Memorial Day. Sailors,keep it clean - you are wearing white.

      I cannot go into a Hallmark, Papyrus or Kate's Paperie without buying tons of cards for occasions that have not even come up yet. Well last Friday, I saw the cutest card with a picture of a Jack Russell puppy with a heart over his head, which was cocked to one side as if he were looking right at you, and inside the words were "Thinking of you with love". I immediately thought of the ex boyfriend who had given me a poster of a jumping Jack Russell a few months ago. I figured, I should send this, I am thinking of him with love. And then I talked to him and I realized, he is not thinking of me with any love. It was one of those strange conversations where you are not sure what the person is thinking about you but they seem annoyed. I guess all calls to ex's can feel like that.  I guess it worked out because I sent the card instead to my friend away in VT working on some mental health issues who sends me post cards once a week. It is nice for me to give back what I received instead of giving, hoping he would reciprocate at some future point. Love is such a fickle, funny feeling.

      I want to thank my friend Steve for waking me up this morning at 6:30 a.m. with a phone call from Japan. Yes Steve, I did call you last week not realizing you were in Japan. Normally if someone is out of the country, I accept that as a valid reason for not returning my call promptly. I was glad to hear him sound so happy and I can't wait to talk to him when he gets back into town on Sunday. I hope he brought me something cool back like rose oil or a silk scarf. If you are reading Steve, hint, hint since you let your mom have my doll.

      I can't believe that motherfucker Tony Soprano had the nerve to have Adriana killed while he protects Tony B in the process. The only reason Adriana got into anything with the feds is because of Christopher. And then a few weeks ago, he was ready to fuck her brains out and now he calls her up with this bullshit story about Christopher committing suicide?? Some nerve. As you can tell from the expletives, I am livid. Adriana came clean and told Christopher the truth - that she has been giving the feds bull shit information. Earth to Christopher, if Adriana had given them anything good, your ass and Tony would be up shit's creak right now. And Tony B? He has some fucking nerve killing not one, but two people without permission. That bug eyed fresh out of jail asshole has no write snuffing out people without the okay from Tony S. I hope Sylvio spared Adriana and maybe she is not really dead. Tony S. didn't even kill Christopher when he threatened him after the alleged Adriana blow job. Right now, I want to snuff out some of those writers!

      Well I told you long ago that Road Rules would win this challenge, but it still surprised me to see it happen again. I really wanted to see Katie blow it for the team which is what is expected from her. The Real World needs some fresh blood out there. MTV needs to get some of those people who keep showing up on  urlLink The Smoking Gun  a chance. Obviously they need the money so they can stop prostituting and stealing cars. Perhaps I am just bitter because at the ripe old age of 25, I am simply too old to appear on most MTV programming. Hey, I guess I am too mature to get drunk everynight and make an ass of myself on TV (actually that is not the case!). But I am too old to up and quit my job and rely on iffy payments from future challenge shows to support my "new acting career".   FYI - My  urlLink Match  profile is now at 510 views (up from 420 last night at 11:30). Why are people in other time zones checking me out?????

      Are these people on  urlLink Craig's List  serious? They actually think you can post a message, get some responses and meet up with a stranger for sex?? Surely this is illegal. I am curious how many people use Craig's List for dating? If you have a story, let me know. Just by rummaging through the postings, there are people who will pay you to "escort" business men in foreign lands, people who have one extra ticket for a show and need a last minute date, and people who want "models" to reply so they can have a night of wild sex. I know NY is full of freaks but I didn't realize so many people think they can meet fellow freaks on Craig's List? I wonder if Craig knew this was what his "list" would be used for...

      In the 3 days since I have made my match.com profile public, I have had a whopping 267 people check me out, 7 e-mails, and 15 winks. I am so gonna have like a 1000 page book about this experience by the end of summer. Thus far my prospects sound good on paper and include a firefighter, an investment banker, a lawyer and a music manager. Surprise, surprise - I am most looking forward to the firefighter. I have never seen a white bald guy look so hot in a uniform. And since he works only 3-4 days a week, he will have lots of time for me! I'll keep you posted.   Can blogs date each other, cause I think my blog and this other blog in DC have been checking each other out and dating....This weblogging is more serious than I thought.

      I went to see two cute movies today. Movies that the person who went with me would never admit to seeing, Mean Girls and Shrek 2. I don't know why I am attracted to movies about high school cliques and the girl on the outskirts ends up saving the day and getting the guy. You would think that I related to that somehow, but in boarding school, I didn't really have cliques. All the black people were friendly with each other (hey, you gotta stick together) and I was also friendly with the girls of other races in my class. I dressed nice and I was cute, so I never stuck out. Yet movies like Mean Girls and Clueless always end up my favorites. Go see it, its fetch!

      I am finally starting to meet a new batch of normal guys from Match.com over e-mail. I think the e-mails from losers could actually merit a losermatchguys.blogspot.com weblog. It is crazy for me because all this time I thought I wanted to meet someone, but every time I hang out with anyone, I could care less about them or what they think. This nonchalant attitude is new to me. I really think I am incapable of liking anyone. After being crushed by an ex last year, I realized I would never give anyone my heart again. So now I wonder, is it possible for someone to fall in love with me again without me actually feeling strongly about them? Women do it all the time, so I guess its a man's turn now. I sure hope so, cause I damn sure don't want to die alone, but I am sure I have met the last guy I am going to love, my sweet Snoopy :o)He is also much cuter than all of the available single men I have been meeting!

      Can you ever get too much of sun, fun, drinking and crazy partying? Considering I returned from my last trip to Miami feeling very under the weather, my first instinct is to answer yes. Well then why the hell am I looking for tickets to do it all over again for Memorial Day. I expect that Miami will be off the chain with the usual long weekend antics, but damn is it a good way to break up the monotony of my boring day-to-day life. If any of my friends are reading this and can dissuade me to instead attend a BBQ where they promise I can make my famous BBQ shrimp on an open grill, holla! If not, see you on South Beach.

      Last picture for tonight. This is one of Snoopy's brothers Otto. When his mom Brandy gave birth to six puppies, there was no way in hell I was going to keep them all. So Otto lives on 14th Street in Union Square with a woman I met on Craig's List who happens to be a beauty editor at Elle Magazine. I am sure he is much happier since he has a nanny, a play group and a Christian Dior bed. Snoppy certainly is not living that large!  urlLink

      Last time I checked, Old Navy was a family shopping store. There commercials always feature fashions for children and adults. So who in the hell at GAP Inc. determined that it was suitable for their new commercial to feature a song about "Daisy Dukes", also known as pum pum shorts or "hot" pants. Maybe I am a bit prude, but something is fishy...

      Why does the Sopranos throw in all these crazy episodes every now and then as if someone behind the scences is saying, "How can we stretch this season out a bit?", "Oh, let's play more head games with Tony". Mobsters in real life are murdered and never seen again. I don't want to see Big Pussy or Richie April or any other snake who got done in any more episodes. Before the end of the series, we need to see Tony S. but a big bullet between the eyes of Tony B. That would be justice.

      Well as you may or not know, I have this obsessive shopping habit. I figured eventually I would run out of room for things, but I didn't realize it would happen so soon. Well it has. Despite 4 closets, 2 dressers and numerous plastic clothing containers my last few purchases have been forced to stay in the shopping bags/boxes they have come in. So I decided to get cracking and start getting rid of everything I did not need. Well I realized I have quite a tee-shirt collection, many of which are too sentimental to dispose of. I have tee-shirts commemorating my boarding school days, the time I tried out to be a VJ on MTV, winning a spring break booty contest in Jamaica, my first law firm job, my first rap concert, my first real job at Reebok, my first vacation with a man and the list goes on. So while I did manage to fill three shopping bags with donations to Good Will (and a smaller shopping bag of things to sell on eBay to make money to buy more stuff), certain tee-shirts will stay in the drawer for many spring cleanings to come. Thanks to Sharifa who I helped move into a new apartment with her boyfriend for inspiring my own cleaning. Now if only I could be inspired to find a man I could actually see myself living with....

      The only thing worse than being sick is not having someone to take care of you. Gosh I need to meet a new man who can whip up chicken soup in a heartbeat. WHERE ARE YOU???Lucky for me between the two days I took off to go to Miami on Monday and Tuesday and calling in sick today, I only worked 2 days this week and surprisingly was pretty productive. Now if I could only get permission to "work remotely" I would be set. I mean what does it mean to "work" from home - proof a DSL hook up and a telephone for conference call. If that is the case, surely I "work" remotely in the morning and at night around work.

      Well I did it. I brought myself the best and first gift for my upcoming birthday in July. I have a round-trip ticket to Majorca, the destination of choice for Europeans. Apparently men in Spain have a thing for black women so I am in luck as well - maybe I will meet someone. This is a huge step for me as it is my first trip by myself. I have invited a friend to come along so I will see if they accept, but I already have a ticket regardless and I can't wait!!! Thanks to my boss and my co-worker for giving me the scoop on Majorca and pushing me to go there instead of Turks & Caicos where I was originally going to go. Feel free to e-mail me tips if you have ever been to this part of Spain. I have 3 months to plan!!! Good night

      I hope all the wonderful mother's out there had a great day. I am sure your children treated you well on this special day. For me, since I am estranged from my mother, it is not a day I really celebrate. The last time I felt like Mother's Day was a special day was last year when my ex invited me along to celebrate with his mom - awwwww. It was sweet and cute. We went to church, visited his family and went back to his parents for a nice home cooked meal. It felt good to be part of a family for a few hours. About a month later, that was relationship was over so I guess it taught me not to get too attached to things like that. Her probably realized I would never be a great mom like his mom. I guess for me Mother's Day is a day for me to think about all the cool mother's who have touched my life even though none of them is my own(Love goes to Sharifa's mom, Steve's mom, Jennifer's mom, Ronald's mom, and Snoopy's mom). Thanks for everything. With love, Z.

      Work lunches always cause you to overeat (and eat the most expensive thing in the menu). When work is paying it is the only time I order a 3 course meal. Of course Mr. Boss, I eat appetizers, entrees and desserts every day so you have to feed me accordingly. Well I started off good because I was so busy running my mouth I forgot to order my appetizer. I did okay again because the best shrimp dish was a shrimp ceasar salad. Then dessert came and I forgot all about that calorie stuff. I ordered the warm chocolate cake complete with ice cream and whipped cream. So back to the drawing board tomorrow. Now as I watch the last Friends, my stomache growls in pain since I denied myself dinner to make up for those extra calories. Ah, the pain us women endure to be thin. Sometimes I wish I was a real fat bitch so I could just get my stomache stapled.Hmmm, it might be fun trying to get that big.... Later. Gotta finish FRIENDS!!!

      I have been on a real diet for two whole days now. Not Atkins, not Zone, just a simple book where I have been keeping a track of everything that enters my mouth (hmmmm) and writing down how many calories and how much fat they each contain. I have been keeping calorie intake under 1200 calories per day which is great considering I burn 400 calories a day in the gym. If I can only find a way to burn and eat the same amount, I should shrink in no time. Anyone know how to do that please let me know. Quick question - why are all entrepreneurs and all venture capitalists 90% men? Every VC event I go I feel like the only woman in the room. Ladies of the world, lets go forth and start our own companies so we can make money and fund new ones. Good night!

      On Sundays, better yet any day, my  favorite thing to do after a long day at work or a long day at play is to cuddle in bed. Since I currently don't have a man to do that with (I am working on that, its spring, time to activate my match.com profile), the next best thing is one of my dogs. GiGi (a poodle), my oldest and most beloved is too old and thin to make for good cuddling. He doesn't like to lay still, his breath is worse than all the other dogs and he can't support the weight of my arm without squirming. On a cold day, the best cuddler by far is Brandy (a chubby cocker spaniel). She loves to lay around and do nothing - hence the reason she got fat and despite her sometimes bitchy attitude, she is a sweetheart who loves affection and will lay with you all day long if you let her. The only problem is getting her into the bed. Her weight affects her ability to jump high, so you gotta pull her up sometimes. My newest dog (and the son of GiGi and Brandy) Snoopy is good for days when you feel down or out of it. Not only will he lay with you, but he knows when its time to get out of bed and play with him and he also knows when its time to go to work so you don't oversleep. A few wet kisses and you will want to get up just to wash your face. Thanks to my all my doggies who provide me with unconditional love. I have to find a man to do the same, so ladies stop calling men dogs until I find one.

      I always seem to use  the weekend to take care of all the business I never find time for during the week. I do laundry, shop, bank, grocery food shopping, cleaners (who ever catches them after work before they close), shoe maker, exercise, etc. Why is it that in my life, I only get two days to myself and the other 5 I give to the people who run the company I work for? It just doesn't seem like a fair balance. By the time I cram all those activities into the weekend, Sunday afternoon finds me wanting to crawl into bed tired to get my energy ready for the work week. If we spend the two days we have off from work preparing for work, when does the leisure time come in? If anyone has found an extra day in the week that I have not heard of, please hit me up and let me know where it is. PLEASE!!!!!!!!

      Well its almost midnight so I want to wish Steve a Happy Birthday. Sorry I could not hang out longer. When you hate your job, it sucks going in early and hung over. We just had a lovely dinner at  urlLink Cubana Café  which was decent although not 100% authentic. The flan hit the spot so I will definitely be back.  I am excited to see two of my girlfriends this week since they all have boyfriends and never have time for me. My first college roomie and BFF who I lost contact with last year finally resurfaced and we plan to see each other this Wednesday. We both missed each other and still love each other so I can't wait to give her a hug.   I also have plans to see my other BFF, my female med student friend since she finally has a full week off of school. I am thinking of taking her someplace fun like  urlLink Layla  or  urlLink Casa La Femme . For some reason we always seem to end up at  urlLink Republic . I guess that's what happens when as a broke student you get used to take out, cheap Thai tastes great!

      Friday night - too rainy to do anything! It was the first time I had real plans to go to a club. For all you non-NYers out there I know that clubbing in the big city probably seems like the best thing in the world, but when you have done it since you were 14 (I am now almost 26) it becomes really old, really fast. Well my "brother" Jermaine (you know black people like having fake relatives) was going to take me out to new hot spot Deep, but the thunderstorms gave us a good excuse to stay home instead.  Saturday - Spent the afternoon with the ex again (I know what you are thinking, but NO we are not back together). We grabbed some lunch and enjoyed the beautiful weather on the West Side waterfront. As much as I am still attracted to him, every now and then he will say or do something and I realize he could never be enough for me - "I have to go see my nephew every weekend". Since when did babies get so exciting? Am I too selfish to want to be more important than someone's family? Don't you eventually get married to someone who is supposed to come first in your life, over the family you were born into? Maybe I don't get it because I am not really a family girl, but I want 200% of my man's attention. I guess it makes sense for me to be dating Snoopy - he loves me more than his own mother.  Saturday night - Hooked up with my friend home from Cuba and another mutual friend of ours from  urlLink Prep  and got dinner and drinks at  urlLink Chez es Saada . Then we went to get more rounds of drinks at  urlLink Coffee Shop  - THE NY model hot spot and rare place to get a good drink at 3 a.m.  Sunday - Had brunch plans with 1994-1999 BEST guy friend who I have recently reconnected with but not sure if he is still planning on hanging out with me since I called him at 1:30 a.m. to remind him of our plans. Boy do I miss the food at  urlLink Amy Ruth's , I would go with Hitler if asked. This is why I need to hit the gym more - my whole weekend revolved around putting shit in my mouth and I haven't even had sex in forever to be preggers. I guess its true that women replace sex with food! Must go to the gym tomorrow! Oh wait, I have a lunchtime interview. Ok, will definitely work out twice on Tuesday. Gotta get ready for Spain.

      I feel just like  urlLink this guy  on a night like tonight. It's raining here in NY, so its the perfect night to stay in with a loved/liked one, watch movies, rub a dogs belly and cuddle. Charlotte said it best on Sex and the City, "I have been dating since I was 15 years old. Where is he already!" As much as I hated that bitch, she hit the nail on the head.

      I know what your thinking, wow Z is changing. She is not, but she hates something more than being fat and pregnant - CAT CALLS. I was leaving the office today with a pregnant co-worker and between my office and the train station (2 blocks) and I was approached three times with various "Hey baby" lines. I had on a pair of long black dress pants and a long sleeve dress shirt - why the need to speak to me when obviously I don't want to talk to you. So I am wondering where they sell those fake stomach thingys that people wear to prepare for the real thing so I can start wearing one....and maybe get my job to give me maternity leave so I could work from home....

      According to the  urlLink Wall Street Journal , 90% of Americans will marry at some point in their lives. I guess that means I may have to stop being so picky and just pick one already. Or, I could apply for a job like  urlLink this . To be honest, I don't know which one I prefer.

      Well I did something I thought would turn out worse than it did - spent the night with the ex last night. Don't get excited, I slept on his small couch and was unable to toss and turn the whole night. He made the most amazing salad (the motivation to go over there at that hour). This was a salad that would arrive on a table at Fresco. It was huge and green complete with walnuts, salmon, olives, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, gorgonzola cheese, apples and balsamic vinegar. Then, he taught me how to play chess. I am no expert - I got beat - but it was something I had been meaning to learn since my last trip to the psych ward (maybe I will fill you in during a future post - don't worry, I am  relatively  sane). Well by the time chess and Kill Bill playing in the background was over, it was late and I did have an interview today. I left thinking I would go home, but forgetting my hat and having to use the bathroom lead me back and I figured it best if I just leave in the morning. I dreamt about what made me fall in love with him in the first place (men trying to get at me - pay attention!) - His cooking - the only man I know now who would make me a salad at 10:30 on a weeknight - His mental nourishment - no man I know has ever taught me a cool game - I would always have a good movie to watch - Did I mention Kill Bill? - I am always comfortable with him, despite his great weight loss and what feels like my hugest weight gain ever - all the clothes I brought him during our time together are too big! - He has cool interior design skills I could continue, but I won't for now. I guess what the two men I have fallen in love with have in common is their ability to take care of me. I am not a gold digger by any stretch of the imagination, but it feels good to know your partner can hold you down financially when you need him to. It is also comforting to be taken care of mentally and emotionally, something only complete comfort and acceptance can provide.   Interview - went really well. The headhunter seemed to like me and thought I would be perfect for the job. Bad news - not a huge pay increase, less vacation. Good news - great ad firm to work for - creative, young and hip company which is exactly the type of situation I am looking for. I will keep you posted on my foray outside of legal marketing.  Sorry for the long post - I gotta update more often with shorter posts. Good night!

      Well after about a week of looking for a job, I have my first interview tomorrow afternoon. It is somewhat conincidental that today at work I was also asked to start my review process. I must select up to eight people to review my first year performance which will have an impact on how much of an increase I will get. So far, I have some good review candidates. I work well with the people in my department so they will give me input in addition to a few key partners that I work with a lot.  Anyway, back to my prospective new job. I am interviewing for a job at an advertising agency (more creative, fewer arrogant "I'm so fucking smart" egos). I am excited because I also do well in interview so keep your fingers crossed. If in fact I am forced to stay with my current firm longer than intended, my plan is to go to business school at Baruch. All my friends are like, go to Harvard, you are smart and black and you can get in easily. To be honest if I wanted to work at one of the big banks or accounting firms I would, but major ad and PR firms don't care about the Ivies, they want talented hard working thinkers with good ideas - not someone who looks like they were in the womb reading Chaucer (yes, I still have parts of Canterbury Tales memorized - boarding school does amazing things for your brain capacity).  On the relationship front, the guy I am digging the most who I have decided is a white version of a previous boyfriend is off on holiday in London. I have lost interest in the fireman and he must know that since I don't return his calls and didn't care when he cancelled our last date to work O/T at the firehouse. He is interested in sex, which I guess all men are, but he did not have the tact to make it less obvious when every date ended at his place with me faking tired to be driven home. Things with the "quickie date" (see June 6 post)guy never got off the ground which is fine with me because he lives in NJ and is not that cute and is probably too stupid/slow for me since he is from the south. That leaves one last guy who I have seen twice but have no chemistry with. On a good note, the cop sounds like he wants something serious. He has called twice from London and invited me to a wedding this fall. He is also by far the best at actually dating me. For you men reading this includes: - finding interesting places to take me (zoo, City Island, cool new bars) - making dating easy (picking me up and dropping me off) - not allowing me to pay despite my quick hands grabbing the check - knowing how to kiss me at the end of the night with out grabbing my ass - not assuming that after 4 dates I am ready to sleep with you and driving to your     house without checking with me first - walking on the outside of the street - telling me interesting things about your life - allowing me to choose the station/CD in the car  More to come on tips to date me in future posts but this has it covered so far from my recent experiences. It has been so long since I have been out a lot since my ex's idea of a date was a home cooked meal and a DVD at his place. While I love to stay home sometimes, after a while it becomes too routine and I am still old fashioned in my view of a man "wooing" a woman. I still plan to keep my options open and thus I have reposted my match profile (still waiting on more pics from Cuba to update when my Cuban doctor gets back - 3 more days!!!) and also started casually reading craig's list. Now, don't try this at home as those craig's list guys are a bit wacky and most don't have photos posted immediately. However, those folks are quicker to meet in person so let the speed dates begin. More to follow on that.  Enough about me. I must do some research on this company I am meeting with tomorrow. I will post with some interview results later on in the week.

      All this time one of my match.com prospects has been keeping me under the guise that he was a motorman for the MTA. Well, after a night of drinks and dinner and a huge hug from me, I discovered his gun which forced him to tell me the truth. I sort of smelled something "police-like" about him - the superb driving, the odd hours, the magazine clip, the radio in the background while he was at work but I was trying to be the "baggage free" chick and just accept what is told and given to me without being suspicious. Goes to show you sometimes baggage comes in handy.   Well we did have a nice date despite his being a liar! I realize why I like hanging out with him, he reminds me a lot of my first love who was also a cop. Too bad he is leaving for London tonight. I am actually going to miss him.

      It always takes me about one year at a job to realize how much I hate the corporate world. Yeah I have a corporate card, I take fun business trips, I get a cute little bonus (not a bank bonus, but acceptable, I have an office not some cube but the amount of bullshit that comes with the territory is beyond belief. So I have decided that I need to work in the non profit arena. I am thinking there is less bullshit there and that is just what I need. So if anyone knows of some company hiring people to builds huts in Tibet or something along those lines, just shoot me an e-mail. I have a very impressive background.

      With my friend Linda's baby. I finally got to meet her 5 month old baby while in D.C. and boy is he a heartbreaker. He is the finest chocolate butterball in the world with the cutest long eyelashes and curly afro. I held him most of the day and we even took a nap together. I fed him his gross lunch of rice cereal and wiped it off his face when he made a mess. I can't wait to see him again this weekend in NY!  Don't get it twisted - there is still not a man that walks the earth who could bring me to be permanently connected to him by bearing his child so he could later run off and screw the next hot young thing, but it was fun to play pretend for a day. I know everyone reading this is saying I am bitter, but every married couple I know personally has had to deal with infidelity. At least I know if/when my husband cheats, I'll go to work one day and never come home again. You can't do that after you have pushed out the kids.  Thanks to Linda and all my other girlfriends who will allow me to experience a small fulfilling taste of motherhood, without the hassle, stretch marks, weight gain, permanent disfigurement, financial instability and forever attachment to a male.

      "nicole  I want to inhale her...I want to make her SOOOOOOO happy, or at least as happy as she's made me...I wrote about being in certain types of love, but a part of me remained cynical...sure, in theory you believe that type of love exists, but...I don't know...I guess you don't know until you're there and your brain and heart and mind come to the same frightening realization... "nothing else matters" this is it...the gravy, the grits, the guts...whatever inane analogy you wanna use to describe something of great importance... I love her and she loves me and I love that she loves me and she loves that I loves her and I love that she loves that she loves me and she loves that I love that I love her"  reprinted without permission from  urlLink D. Young's blog .  I had to give this blog props because boy did he sum up in his own words what love is like - inhaling the one you love. My question is, when does that feeling go away? It sucks to feel that when the relationship is long over. Deep down past the mean bitch I like to portray, I am a hopeless romantic who still mourns my first true love - Rodney Johnson a.k.a The Sheriff. That was eight years ago in 1996. Well it took me another 5 years to fall again in 2001 so I guess I am just biding time until 2008. That will be perfect cause I'll be 30 years young and hopefully mature enough to deal with what comes my way.

      Well I only have one event left under my belt at work - the firm's corporate tents at the U.S. Open golf. Fortunately, it seems Father's Day is keeping many folks from wanting to attend. If that keeps up, its Marketing Team Day on the green! I will finally be able to get some straight facts from my boss as he opens up as soon as the liquor hits his blood. After that - my calendar is free and clear. I cannot wait to spend the day at work relaxing again - reading Page Six, In Touch, US Weekly, etc. I am so behind in celebrity gossip! I am so behind in cheesy TV. How lame was the MTV Movie Awards. Either they are getting worse or I am getting too old to think they are cool. I hope its not the latter :o(

      Well surprisingly, everything that went well in DC for my event. I was even able to have a little fun with the girls in the DC office for a little lunch on the firm. My dog was well behaved in the hotel and no one complained about him! So of course I was pissed to come home and find my bedroom and living room in disarray because of a "surprise" apartment makeover gone bad. I immediately dropped my things off and headed for the bar. Frozen Mojito's are the bomb. If you know Moe's in Fort Greene, get yours there.  Well I took my profile down from match. I am waiting for some good pictures from my friend Ed that we took while in Cuba. Then I'll start off fresh. But for now, I have my hands full with four guys to rotate and date which is a fun change. You never realize how long its been since you have had sex until you have a serious make out session. I am sticking with my rule of no sex until I have a boyfriend - but boy is kissing fun. Nothing wrong with being a cock tease every now and then.

      I just want to thank Ronald Reagan for deciding to  urlLink drop dead  now of all times when I have an event scheduled in DC. I want to thank the Secret Service for the security they will provide at my event since I will be making full use of my terrace location. Last but not least, I want to thank the family of Regan who thought it best to send him out like  urlLink Biggie  and  urlLink Aaliyah  and plan to parade his body through the streets,  urlLink fuck up traffic , close off streets and create a mass histeria in an entire city. Did anyone forget that he had Alzheimer's so even if he was alive, he would not know what the fuck was going on. Why bother with all this shit anyway?? Only Reagan can fuck with people while alive and again with his death. Thanks for everything. And for those of you that don't know, I am a die hard  BLACK  Republican. Fuck poor people, fuck the umemployed, fuck the uneducated, fuck the people with too many kids to feed. I don't want to pay for your problems with my tax dollars (which is why I have a $3k tax bill).

But from what I have been told, I am cute girl so when I got an e-mail from  urlLink this guy  through match, I thought someone must be playing a joke on me. Its not funny. I don't want to be scared of anyone's photo when I open my inbox. This is my last post until next week. Enjoy!

      Well, it seems that someone at my firm is reading my blog. I don't know who, I don't know why, but I intend to get to the bottom of it. I am going away on business and may possibly return to writing the blog when I get back on Sunday. Since I work at a law firm, I am a bit nervous. Luckily, I have never mentioned my firm name or discussed firm business, but sometimes with blogs you never know what is wrong until you do it. If you are the guilty party, please send me an e-mail or leave me a comment to let me know if I should worry.  P.S. Who the hell in Modesto, CA is reading me religiously? I hope its not Scott Peterson!

      More birthday gift ideas for those of you still looking for that perfect item. This tank is about $60 and can be purchased at www.orghipchick.com. It is in the Ella Moss section and it is "The Milk Shake Tank." My milk shake definitely brings all the boys to the yard and its better than all of yours. So pick this up for me in a size medium. All colors acceptable.  urlLink

      My friend Ed and his parents are very close. Not at all like the dysfunctional relationships that exist in my "family". So I figured, of course he told them he was dropping out of school. Well, needless to say I was dead wrong. I had to break this news to them over dinner last night. Ooops. Hopefully they will keep their promise and not mention anything until he comes home and tells them himself.  Match Updates  1. Date #2 with the fireman started off rocky but ended up okay. Being late is NEVER a good way to start off with me. And on a date, I'm the only one who is allowed to act pissy. Men being pissy is a turn-off, very feminine. We ended up at a cute sake/sushi lounge in Queens. We don't have the same taste in music. I am wondering how that affects a relationship long term....  2. Short "meeting" with a new match contender. I will call him Southern Boy. I was running errands in the city and he was at work on a SATURDAY??? So we met for coffee at Starbucks. Great personality. Too bad he is not as cute as he looks in pictures, parties way too much for my taste, wears weird "man sandals", and lives in Bumblefuck, NJ. The accent is surprisingly sexy. Of course I occasionally replayed it in my head during our Starbucks date with him moaning my name. I'll give him another shot as I was slumming in flip flops, cargos, aviators and a kangol - my weekend uniform.

      He has a motorcycle and took me dancing. There is no need to elaborate - date #2 will happen as soon as I get back from DC.

      Well, I have been trying to meet up with one of my many match.com prospects since last week, but he keeps pulling "the same day". For all you men out there, if you are interested in meeting up with a woman, do not attempt to make plans with her the same day you want to see her. Regardless of what I have on my plate, I will not juggle my day around to make time for someone who thought of hanging out with me as an after thought. A woman worth getting know always has things to do, even if that means heading home straight after work to pick up suits from the cleaners. If a chick you are trying to get with is always available, obviously she has way too much free time, which is usually not a good sign. This rule does not apply to people you already know and are close to, but new folks must plan.   Ladies, if a guy asks you out same day, NEVER accept. For one, you never want to start of trend of being the last minute go-to girl. Secondly, if you really wants to see you, he will ask you about your schedule and plan accordingly with you. If he doesn't, he is not worth getting to know or is not that interested in seeing you. Either way, better to realize this up front before investing your time which is priceless.  I am going to give this match prospect one more chance to make plans, after that, his number will forever be in the "missed calls" list.

      In addition to cleaning out the physical in your life for spring, for many its a time to get dropped or do the dropping in a relationship. Give or take a few weeks, it was right around this time last year that I was being dropped by my most recent ex.   Let me preface the following information with the fact that a few years ago I was hanging out with some friends and the owners of Joe's Pub, a local hot spot in NY. We were sitting in what is the only booth in the club. Usher and his crew came in making comments like "That booth is reserved for us" and "Do you know who I am?" Needless to say, we did not budge. He left the club in a huff and I have never liked him since. One of my college girls was good friends with a girl he used to date (I won't say her name, but she is the daughter of a famous black male celebrity - these are the folks you meet in private school). She too did not have fond words for him, so my hatred is justified. But back to the ranch, how dope are the lyrics to  Burn . I have reprinted some of them below. This song is fitting at those times towards the end of a relationship. Shit, I still feel some of this now.                                Burn I know I made a mistake Now it's too late I know she ain't comin back What I gotta do now To get my shorty back Ooo ooo ooo ooooh Man I don't know what I'm gonna do Without my booo You've been gone for too long It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over Been knew it was through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh) I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)  This goes out to everyone burning right now from a relationship, which is probably everyone reading this now.

      Well one of my best friends has recently informed me that he is dropping out of med school in Cuba to spend a year at home studying for the USMLE's and transfer to a US school. Well is it wrong for my first thought to be that I won't have anyone to visit in Cuba anymore? Of course, my second thought was for his academic/professional future. Taking a year off will delay his education and make him about 29 by the time he finishes. I had plans for him meeting a great Cuban chick to marry so I could go over their house and have authentic Cuban dishes. Oh well, hopefully Steve will get married soon to a nice Dominican chick so I can have Sunday meals there instead.

      I don´t want to spend all day on the computer so this will not be a well thought out blog...  I am not as dark as I want to be yet. I have been doing more sightseeing and shopping than tanning. That will change by Friday/Saturday.  Norwegian Wood by Murakami (not the handbag designer) is an amazing book. It made me cry on the beach (hard to do). Love is such a powerful emotion. I hate being in love and I hate not being in love. I hate the ex for consuming my thoughts more than he should. I guess that´s because he was the last person I loved. C´est la vie. He tells me "goodbye" but then reads the blog. WTF???? How do you block someone from reading?Just him, the rest of you can stay. Thanks to Matt for recommending the book.  urlLink Bad man  thinks that more sex will help you forget a past love. Mental note, must have more sex. I had planned on possibly indulging while here, it being my birthday and all and you should get laid on your birthday, but&nbsp;ALL of the Spanish men here I have met smell, BAD! Musty balls is not a sexy thought. Will make up for this when I get back. Cute but stinky. FYI, Adrian Grenier is half Native American, half European. Not a Latin cell in his body, as per Instyle.   The food here is pretty good. Not as good as food I have had in Cuba, but satisfying. It´s hard to get full in this heat. That siesta thing is a good idea. I just awoke from a nap (it is 5pm here) After I am done at this internet cafe, I will go enjoy a huge birthday dinner and then probably get drunk off sangria. I had to buy a watch. The last watch I wore was a Powerpuff girls watch. This one is adult, a Swatch. My cell phone usually keeps time, but not here obviously. I also purchased shoes (I am a woman), clothes, and some gifts for two people. Not a lot to buy here. The street fair today reminded me of Canal Street.&nbsp;Africans sell fake Louis Vuitton EVERYWHERE!!! Tomorrow the fair is supposed to have nice leather goods. I hope to find something suitable for the godfather (mine, not Brando).  My hotel is as gorgeous as the website,  urlLink www.hotelsanlorenzo.com . The Spanish are nice, but not as nice as other Latin places I have visited. Must go, internet card running out.

      I just want to let everyone know I arrived safely, despite being hassled by security for some strange reason at the airport in Palma. The town is lovely; I have only been here for 5 hours or so but I have done lots of window shopping and devoured a lovely meal washed down by sangria. Sunday is a day of rest in Palma so many things are closed. If I get time, I will keep you posted on my activities.   Thanks to Lawyer for showing me a great time on Friday. I am glad I was able to prove to him that not all people you meet on Craig´s List are fat, ugly and weird. Lawyer and I wrote lists of what was wrong with the other. At the top of my list was that I am controlling (so what, I´m a Leo) and at the top of his list was that Lawyer cannot hold his liquor! I got that boy so messed up he was ready to let me drive his car and I don´t even have a license.   MC was so sweet and made up for not seeing me all week by coming to Brooklyn to take me on a goodbye/happy b-day lunch. We had Mexican next door to Moe´s and then took a lovely stroll through Fort Greene and capped the afternoon off sitting in the park watching the dogs romp. It was definitely worth almost missing my plane. Flirting came in handy at the check-in gate because I was upgraded after a few batted eyelashes! MC and I have more in common than I thought and I really hope at the very least we can be friends after he leaves NY in Sept. I´m going to do my best not to get too attached since he is leaving but we do have a Brand Nubian show and a visit to the zoo on the schedule before he goes back to Ann Arbor.   Adios from Mallorca!

      It seems Sun has taken an earlier flight to Spain from NY and left without me. Don't worry Sun, I'll catch up with you on Sunday.   I went to CompUSA to pick up my new memory card (no time to wait for shipping) and came back fresh as a baby's ass out of the shower - except I did not have the luxury of taking this shower naked.  Text to Lawyer - "I am so wet....and disheveled. If we still meet tonight you must not hold it against me." Response from Lawyer&nbsp;- "Being wet is NEVER a bad thing." Devil!  Only 32 more hours until my flight on Saturday - yippee!!!

      Her boyfriend has been gone visiting dying family member for 7 weeks). He and I used to hang out almost as much as I hung out with her.   Me: So when does he get back? I would like to see him.  Her: He gets back next Wednesday, the day of your birthday.  Me: What great timing. What do you have planned for his return.  Her: I am cleaning the apartment.  Me: That's it.  Her: Yeah, I took Wednesday, Thursday and Friday off.  Me: That's fun. You guys should book a trip.  Her: No, he has been gone seven weeks. We are going to stay in and fuck all day until I go back to work on Monday.  Me: Wow, I've gone longer than that.  Her: Your single.

      Have decided to leave NY with final date with new lawyer guy. Shitty friends (I still love them to pieces, except for Jennifer Wade at this moment)&nbsp;suck at getting together a cohesive plan for birthday drinks before I depart. As usual, I will spearhead the celebration when I return. After discussions, it has been determined that&nbsp;lawyer guy&nbsp;is not a large firm lawyer, but rather a New York city lawyer working on Labor&nbsp;& Employment issues for some government agency (cannot recall exact agency due to marjarita intake prior to conversation). Furthermore, although we met on craig's list, somehow he has determined which firm I work at and is familiar and friendly with a partner at my firm - the lone black partner who subtly flirts with me on every occasion. Wow, the world is too small. He also had a good reason for the whole Lot 61 thing - he is not a native NYer. Classic! I can corrupt him. For starters, there are loads better places to go on&nbsp;a Friday night....I hope.   Why did&nbsp; urlLink Amazon  send me the wrong memory card? Dumb Fucks!@! Scored a last minute one from  urlLink CompUSA . Hopefully nothing else will go wrong with this vacation. With the exception of the shitty exchange rate for Euros - my 1k will currently get me 861 Euros. Does anyone know how much each pitcher of Sangria is?

      Since I work at a law firm, have worked at  urlLink two   urlLink others  in the past and dated several lawyers, I decided after the last lawyer to never talk to another lawyer unless 1) it was work related or 2) I had been arrested or wronged. Well I have been talking sporadically over e-mail with a guy I met on Craig's List and just found out today he was lawyer. Voice-mail from potential date after my rejection of his idea to meet him at Lot 61, "Excuses, excuses.  You don't do clubs ? The only reason&nbsp;I am going out is because I have been so busy with this trial I need to unwind. Hopefully we can get together before you leave."   WTF??!!?? Not once has he mentioned the legal profession. Me being not so much concerned these days with a guys job title, never asked. Associate, Partner, Staff Attorney, Of Counsel, Counsel - these are titles I want nothing to do with. So now my dilemma&nbsp;- is it wrong to discriminate based on job. Does anyone know what kind of crowd Lot 61 attracts on a Friday night? Was I too quick to dismiss that idea? What happened to let's get a drink and see if you can hold a conversation for longer than 10 minutes?

      So I am flying to  urlLink Ibiza  and  urlLink Mallorca  on Saturday night and not arriving until Sunday afternoon. Who should be the last person I see before I leave? I need some male interaction to analyze on the flight. Of course Ed will win the last seen portion&nbsp;by circumstance since he offered a ride to the airport. Thanks again&nbsp;- love a friend who offers a favor!  I would love to have a naked tango with MC for memory sake during the plane ride and the trip (just in case none of the Spaniards pan out). He is also more laid back than Moe which is intriguing because I am wondering what I have to do to get a reaction out of him. I want to test him until he becomes animated; I don't really care if the release is positive or negative, as long as he gets off this even wave. However, Moe continues to surprise and impress me. In addition to the creepy stalking, like remembering every date and every outfit in his bar, he also has popped up to take me to lunch in the city twice this week.   Thank God - &nbsp;since the only thing I had to look forward to today was the ice cream social at work.&nbsp;Law firms know deep down they treat you like shit, so every now and then they give out bagels for breakfast or ice cream and think they have restored the status quo.   Tonight I went to the Bad Boy P. Diddy comedy show with my boy Ed, looked at the line and decided to hang out in Fort Greene park instead and smoke out while we played with dogs. Nothing like a good white carb to cure the munchies, so we headed to  urlLink One Greene  and chowed down on edamame, seaweed salad, sushi and sashimi. To keep that feeling of being too full at bay, we head back through the brownstones of Fort Greene and finished off the joint. Of course we then hit Moe's. I was very lucky that my manager friend was not there, so we were able to hang out without interruption. After one too many rounds and realizing how much sake, frozen mojitos and Corona I have had, I was ready to hit the sack. 2 more days of hanging out til Spain. 2 more days of finding out exactly what folks got me for the birthday. Leos love gifts!

      There is a certain sense of power and intrigue&nbsp;that comes from the idea that near and far some guy who has heard of me or may have met me is taking his sweet precious time performing google searches to find me and/or my blog. Wouldn't have been easier to just ask for the URL?  &nbsp;  D.C. update - I read some of the short stories from my D.C. youngin. His stories are so poignant, powerful and vibrant. They tell stories of people in pain and people on the side lines. I loved them. I imagined destroying the  urlLink suite  we enjoyed on my last trip with our wild night and then being awoken at dawn with a live reading of a new piece. We shall have to save that for the next trip and make sure I don't get drunk with any summer associates at the firm first. Tipsy+Sex= GO, Drunk+Sex= NO. We exchanged some e-mails. Hopefully I will see him after Spain next week but before Miami for Labor Day.

      Well for all you that have yet to get me something for my birthday, today is your lucky day.  urlLink Ipod  just dropped it's price $100 so the 40G model would be great! If you engraved it with "Buttercup" I would be extra grateful. I could also use a good jewelry box. They sell nice ones at  urlLink Hallmark . I need a large one, so go with the $75 model. I am not dripping in ice yet, but those street fairs across the world always get the best of me. Lastly, I refuse to succumb to the bullshit that is the world of digital cameras and get the  urlLink memory card  that I need for my trip to Spain. So, why don't you take the liberty of doing it for me?

      This bitch is the reason that men are afraid of marriage. It's like that show where the people peeled their faces to reveal aliens. Men probably think that once they pop the question, they will peel back a woman like  urlLink this !  &nbsp;  Thanks to  urlLink Chris  for pointing out this site. Thank God my mother taught me that the knight in shining armor fantasy with a hot rich guy was bullshit and she made sure she gave me a nice education so I would not worry about a husband. Don't get me wrong, I still worry about getting laid as frequently as&nbsp;I would like by the right guy :o)

      Lex has written a response to my suggestion of divine indifference:  &nbsp;   Hi Buttercup. No worries about lack of permissions...I am flattered that you quoted me.     You make a very good point. Divine Indifference definitely works, on both males and females, but it drives the men truly insane. They are not used to being ignored, and as you can see in our friend BadMan's site, there is no greater turnoff than hearing the words, "I'm starting to care for you", after a casual romp in bed with a fling.   This Indifference you suggest reminds me of THE RULES, no? Personally, my mother always told me what her mother always told her: "Never call a guy. Let him call you."     Did you ever notice that the guys you don't really care for are the ones who pursue you the most aggressively? The ones that you don't call, call right on time and frequently? This is the proof.     It is REALLY DIFFICULT to be an aggressive, independent, and forthright woman these days, when ancient rules still apply.&nbsp; (Buttercup comment - TOO fucking true, honesty is not as appreciated as people might think)     Between all this Worshipping, Being Worshipped and Being Indifferent, can we agree that these terms only apply to either relationships that are casual, or just starting, or the kind that go nowhere? I still hold that none of these options are suitable for a fulfilling, REAL relationship.   &nbsp;  While I have never read "The Rules", I do think that I follow rules when I date guys I like. If I see no future with you, but you are hot, I might hang out with you for a while to kill time but eventually I will get bored. Being a Leo, I need to be kept excited. With the two men I have loved and have loved me in return (which are the only two REAL relationships I have had - sorry to any guy I have gone out with who is reading this, you were a placeholder), I have not followed the path or worship, be worshipped, or be indifferent. But, I also came out of both those relationships burned and looking back it was because I gave my heart too quickly (i.e, before they gave theirs). No one likes to go out on a limb alone and if you go out there first, the guy has a chance to take his time joining you or leave you sitting out there looking stupid. And my grandma, mother, best male friend&nbsp;(and the ex!!) said it best - you should marry a guy who loves you more than you love him. You can start this by letting him go out there on that limb first. Love can never be perfectly 50/50 and women give up more in marriage than men anyway.  &nbsp;  So now, even if I like someone, I play the field and hope they show me their true colors first. If they do, and the feeling is mutual, I drop everything/everyone else (all other men on the plate)&nbsp;like a bad habit (which cost me a great potential real relationship with the DJ because of the ex who thought he wanted me but&nbsp;changed his mind months later). If they don't, I guess it was never meant to be but that does not mean we can't be friends (really!). This is where we transition from dating to "hanging out". Through this process, I have gotten my great collection of male friends who will do anything and everything for me, because I never acted interested in them and they never got to fuck me. Men love that shit.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Please note that special rules apply for fuck buddies. Said rules may be addressed in future posts.

      Reprinted without permission from  urlLink Lex's Blog :    Right now I am reading   urlLink  BadMan's bible    :"The Joy of Letting Women Down", by Natalie D'Arbeloff. The premise is that there are two types of men in this world: the Reliable Male and the Worshipped Male. The reliable male, is generally, what you'd call a "nice guy." He treats women well, he sounds good on paper, you wouldn't mind being seen with him at a restaurant...Unfortunately for him, he doesn't drive women wild with passion. No. On the other hand, the Worshipped Male is the bad boy who seems to always get the girls...women know what they're getting into, but they don't care. He drives them mad with lust.   The author of this book does have a good point--women tend to go for the guy who makes them nervous, and unsure about how he feels about them. Is he going to call? Is he checking out that model at the end of the bar? Does he care about me as a person? For example, the Worshipped Male (WM) must use the tactic of "Hit/Miss" to reel a girl in...You give a girl something pleasurable (a great, fabulous date that makes her feel like she's the only one in your life), followed by something unexplained (no call for five days!). Then, five days later, "What are you up to on Friday?" Addiction is thusly formed.   This bears an odd resemblance to an experiment I performed on rats during my senior year as a psychology major. For rats, the Hit/Miss tactic is the equivalent of giving them a pellet of food when they press a bar , and then to not give them any food at all, even when they press the bar exactly the same way as before. This causes a rat to do some pretty insane things---they become superstitious. They claw at the bar. They run in circles around the cage. They hit it over and over. Eventually, they cower in the corner, shivering, reduced to near paralysis. One more try--and then, yes! A pellet of food! Rat forgets the torment she just endured, and starts to press the bar again, hoping for the next litle morsel of pleasure.   I think this is a great process--if you want to attract rats. I know we've all been through this, man or woman. Sometimes you only want a challenge. The point is to "win" the affection of another person, but once it is won, it is no longer fun. Badman indeed gets any woman he wants--read his blog. He's a force to be reckoned with. But I think he might admit that eventually, he would like to meet the right woman, who he doesn't feel the need to play headgames with.  Tactics such as these will attract women--but not women who are looking for a serious relationship, or who are eager to enter into a healthy and wonderful partnership with another person. Wait. Perhaps that's the point. This book is just about getting laid and growing your ego! Ah. Ok, I can stop writing now.   I think I've been on both sides of the coin: I have been worshipped and I have done my share of worshipping. But any type of unequal relationship, is, in the end, unfulfilling. And obviously, those relationships based on ego and lust did not work out...For example, the "Email Breakup" guy. Yes, it was extremely short-lived, but it represented the end of my phase of going after guys that just needed worshipping--the kind of guys who I knew in my gut from the moment I met them, that they wouldn't want a relationship, and I wasn't ready for one either.    Lex came thisclose to hitting the nail on the head. She neglected to mention one other option besides being worshipped or worshipping - divine indifference. Now, when I met new guys, I set no expectations, I don't start thinking about being his girlfriend, I don't make him the new sole focus of my life,&nbsp;I just sit back and enjoy the experience (and&nbsp;sometimes fantasize about sitting on his face). If you have no expectations, how can you get hurt? Sometimes men start acting like&nbsp;pussies (see Officer London posts) but most times, they enjoy the lack of pressure and you would be surprised how much they come suddenly come&nbsp;running!

      Rarely do I put my friends on blast on this blog or even give out their government names. Afterall, none of them read it and I don't want to them showing up in  urlLink google . But Jennifer deserves this, so she is going to get it. We go back 13 years since the days we met at  urlLink Prep .&nbsp;So then how did she think she could make her way to the city for a wedding, hang out with her little  urlLink Columbia  crew at  urlLink One Little West 12  and then say that we could have dinner on Sunday and turn her phone on (I know this because it went straight to voice-mail all day). Bitch! This is why I have never come to visit you at  urlLink school . This is also why all my close friends are men. They are surprisingly more sensitive than you think. Only when you aren't fucking them of course :o)

      I am so done with boring, shallow men that I can no longer take the energy to explain why I didn't connect with you or why I don't want you to call me. I surely don't have the energy to blog about why my date tonight sucked. So I will move on to better topics, my dog and T.V.  &nbsp;  Here is the perfect reason why I love my dog Snoopy but, I also want to bash his head in sometimes. I gave all the dogs a large rawhide treat today. Those rawhides are a long term treat for my small dogs as it takes them a few days to finish them off. So after a while, Brandy and GiGi put their rawhide aside to save for latter. Sure enough I come home tonight to find that Snoopy has rounded up the treats from the other two and hidden them in my comforter. He sits calmy in the hallway with his own treat as if he has no idea why he is the only one with one left. I love the little guy cause he has balls, but every now and then when I walk him, I see a Pit Bull or a Rotti and wish they would kick the shit out of him just to teach him a lesson.  &nbsp;  I am sorry I missed the new HBO show Entourage. The lead actor,&nbsp; urlLink Adrian Grenier &nbsp;is gorgeous. And he is from Brooklyn. Of course he loses points for once dating  urlLink Melissa Joan Hart .&nbsp; I will be in Spain in less than a week. Hopefully all the men I meet will look just like him. If anyone watched the show and loved it or hated it, hit me in the comments box. I didn't read grebat things, but what do you expect from  urlLink Marky Mark ?

      Well my  urlLink hairdresser's  husband is&nbsp;a member of Diddy's entourage. Needless to say, it's fun to get my hair done and be regaled with tales of her weekends in the Hamptons, Dominican Republic, and Paris. As long as the bitch is back to do my hair when I need her to, I am cool with her many trips. Well she signed me up for some live taping of a comedy show in Brooklyn titled "Bad Boy Comedy". So now Diddy is going to have a television show about comedy. Producing, rapping, broadway, movies, fashion, politics, comedy?? Is it me, or is this Diddy overkill. Now I have to round up three folks to attend with me this Wednesday. I will be sure to post a review following.

      People always give me a funny look when they see my nickname Buttercup&nbsp;somewhere. It's on my phone, it's the name of my computer, I use it as an e-mail address, and of course it is the moniker for this blog. Well, my nickname comes from the Buttercup of  urlLink Powerpuff Girls  fame. If you have ever seen the show or the movie, you know there is nothing funny about Buttercup. She is the toughest fighter of the three, who acts first and thinks second. A guy I used to date who is now a good friend (despite the fact that he stuck&nbsp;his tongue down my throat over lunch last week)&nbsp;branded me as his personal Buttercup a few years ago.&nbsp;It got a little crazy when I had all the PPG games on my Gameboy, the PPG watch and Buddy icon, etc. Here are some links to  urlLink Buttercup   urlLink character   urlLink descriptions  - trust that she is not to be fucked with.

      Yesterday, despite my boss acting like he left his balls at home recently, he gave me a Summer Friday which means I left the office at 3:00 p.m. So after a wardrobe change at home, I met my friend at the Whitney. Friday is "pay what you wish" day so we dropped a dollar and were off to see the exhibits. I won't go into their permanent collection or the Ed Ruscha exhibit which were both good, but Ana Mendieta's work is AMAZING. For those of you who don't know, I have a thing for crazy people. I love people who are "off" and Ana certainly is. I guess that also explains my fascination with Angelina Jolie - besides her perfect face and body. Mendieta's work included  urlLink one photo  of her covered by a white sheet, with the white sheet covered in blood and an animal heart over her own heart under the sheet. Another  urlLink piece  was a series of photos of Ana and a man as he shaved his beard off and she re-applied it to her own face. My favorite  urlLink photo  was of Ana covered in a chicken's blood and feathered so that she herself became the chicken. I know this may sound a little odd as I describe it, but seeing the work visually was moving. Ana became  urlLink one  with each of her works, hence the title "Earth and Body". For me, great art is personal and each photo, sculpture and movie clip was an clear expression of her and her thoughts.   After working of an appetite, we hit  urlLink Serafina , my new favorite restaurant on the Upper East Side. Everything was perfect from the salmon and tuna tartar, to the pasta with calamari and shrimp, to the ravioli. The waiter selected a complimentary chardonnay and the setting suggested an old Italian village. If you every in the area, I suggest a visit.   We got wind of a concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom featuring  urlLink Slick Rick  and  urlLink Kanye West  - needless to say we were there. In my "old" age, I still have a candle burning for Slick Rick the Ruler. I grew up on tracks like Children's Story and Hey Young World and Slick Rick delivered! Kanye West is also a great live act as he knew how to tease the crowd before closing his set with Jesus Walks. You would have thought the hardest thugs in world were auditioning for a church choir! The evening ended for us at daybreak and I can't believe it has taken me an hour to finish this post. As you can deduce, my mind is still in a haze.  &nbsp;  Happy Saturday. And Ed thanks for breakfast, but, you will never see your Knicks tee-shirt again. Sorry.

       I have been reminded that I did not fill you guys in on the  urlLink Roots  date with MC. Well things did not start off well - MC left his phone at work so after not hearing from him I began to think I was stood up. I got kind of wet waiting in the rain for the Roots to begin their set. When they finally did go on, it was hot, but they did  5  songs!!! What a waste. Well I went home alone and wet and kind of pissed that I was stood up. No more than ten minutes later MC calls and explains and we decide to hit the after party despite us both having to work the next day. Luckily by this point the weather cleared up, so I changed out of my wet soggy boots and slipped on some sandals instead. After teaching MC about the  urlLink trains , we hit the party which was overpriced, empty and the bouncer had the nerve to be selective despite the lack of a crowd. Folks, this is why I do not participate in the club scene in NY.   &nbsp;  We stayed at the club for 3 rounds and talked about everything under the sun. I love a man who can say more to me than "Damn ma, you got a phat ass", so he won cool points for that. We moved the party to  urlLink APT , which was FREE and way more poppin'. We stayed there for a few more rounds when my stomach started telling me, "Hey bitch, you only gave me an apple and some coffee today. What the fuck is your problem??".&nbsp; We capped off the night enjoying the  urlLink Tipping Point , since the whole after party was a bust only to find out&nbsp;the next day according to  urlLink www.okayplayer.com  that not only did they perform, but  urlLink Kweli  and  urlLink Musiq  stopped by for guest spots. Needless to say I am pissed. I could have hung - after all I took a "sick" day. MC will not suffer from the one date per person rule. I'll keep you posted on our future endeavors.

      Well I went out for&nbsp;a quick drink tonight with a guy&nbsp;I met on Craig's List. He was very sarcastic and dry (which I like) but just not appealing for my eye. At first glance (from the photos he e-mailed me) I thought he was Italian, but actually he was Iranian. I am not picky about ethnicity so that did not bother me. What did annoy me was that I tried to guess how tall he was based on the surroundings in the room he was pictured in; boy was I wrong and the 4 inch heels I wore&nbsp;nearly towered over him. My rule of thumb is, if you don't want to rip his clothes off, don't see him again. Needless to say, despite us both sharing an astrological sign (Leo), we did not share our birthday suits.  &nbsp;  I have only&nbsp;one date planned for the weekend, a follow-up with MC and possibly a friend of his visiting from out of town. I have never had a problem juggling men, so showing two attractive men a good time in New York will be a piece of cake. Any cute chicks in the NY metro area want to tag along, hit me on e-mail and submit a photo and a reason why you should hang with us on Saturday (trust me ladies, the friend is&nbsp;hot, I just don't have any single female friends).&nbsp;I will post tomorrow with my review of the  urlLink Ana Mendieta exhibit  at the Whitney Museum. Thanks to my "Cuban doctor" for always reminding me that I should use my brain sometimes instead of just getting drunk every night this summer. Which reminds me, I have lost 5 pounds on a low food, high alcohol diet this past week. Perhaps the new diet craze will be the Vodka plan. You heard it here first.

      Well all this time I was worried because I had not heard from my D.C. youngin or my Morris Chestnut (MC) look alike in a few days. Turns out that D.C. boy went on vacation and just got back to the office today and has been asking around if anyone had talked to me. So now my counterpart in D.C. is making fun of me asking what I did to him because he never goes to her office and all of a sudden he comes to her office to "chat". Let's see how long it takes for him to call me.  MC finally got back to my e-mail after 3 days (I guess everyone is not addicted to the computer like me) with an e-mail at 5:45 a.m.!!!! We are going to go to check out the Roots free concert (weather permitting) and then head to the afterparty.   Craig's List update - Despite the response from Al Roker's twin, I am meeting up with a hot real estate agent tomorrow for drinks that I met from that one post. He and I have a love affair in common - with mojitos!! I will have updates tomorrow night. Now I am off to brave the rain and change clothes to hang with MC. Stuffy suits are never sexy!

So I ordered one up from  urlLink Amazon  and with one day shipping it was waiting for me when I got home tonight. I picked out the  urlLink Minolta Dimage XG  model which so far has taken some really good indoor photos. I can't wait until tomorrow when all eBay listings have a one cent gallery charge. Junk in the closet - Bye Bye! Money in my wallet - Hello!  I also snuck in some pictures of the family which I will post shortly. Not my family silly, my doggy family - Brandy, GiGi and Snoopy!

      I have been accused by Officer London of leading him on. I don't know how you can lead a guy on when you have been out with him no more than 6 times, disclosed the fact that you were dating other people, did not advance past kissing him and made it clear that if he could not be better at communicating time/plan changes you were no longer going to see him. I don't know how more upfront you can be. Men will be men I suppose, as usual, the minute you lose interest, their interest peaks.

      Someone must be playing a cruel joke on me. Just for fun, I decided to post on craigslist and see what type of people I would get to respond to me. I only see two men out of 25 e-mails(better/faster response rate than match!) that I am even considering meeting in person.  urlLink This man  is one that does not have a shot in hell. I hate to sound shallow, but let's be serious, he looks like your local weather man.  FYI - I was telling a friend a story about meeting guys in person for the first time after the online introduction. I explained to her how it can be a bit scary getting into a car with a stranger so I have taken to carrying my sharpest cutting knife from the kitchen in my purse. She responds, "Why not get some mase or pepper spray"? Too prissy I say, I want to see the reward of blood shed from any man who attempts to take advantage of me. This shall serve as a warning.

      Well I loaded up on plans today, but only one came to fruition - eating and shopping with Sabby. My friend home from Cuba had to celebrate the anniversary of his grandfather's death so our plans to see a Cuban artist exhibit at the Whitney were scrapped. We will reschedule for the week. I also had a date with Officer London who called me at 12:15 a.m. to confirm plans and I didn't answer because I was out with the loser young guy from last night. Needless to say, suddenly Officer London's phone was broken all day until he sent me a text at 8:00 p.m. to tell me something "happened" and he can't make then. I sent one back asking him to call me. He responded that he was not in the mood to talk he would call me tomorrow. I told him not to bother because while I have enjoyed hanging out with him, I have decided to see someone else exclusively (lie!). Guess what - suddenly he was in the mood to talk. As I tell every guy I meet, I don't have time for bullshit. Good luck to Officer London should he choose to get back on match as he won't be seeing me again.  Well while Officer London was out being an inconsiderate fuck, I was enjoyed brunch at  urlLink Cubana Cafe . Then we hit the Soho shops full force (side note - spent way too much money this pay period, must buy digital camera to take photos of old clothes to raise money on  urlLink eBay  for Spain trip. Well we then went back to her place to listen to Too Short and enjoy some sticky which only caused us to go back and get more food this time around at  urlLink I Coppi . A fabulous evening as always (minus the fab meal that Officer London was to prepare for me). Thanks Sabby!

      Well for those of you that don't follow tennis, love equates to ZERO and that is where the young bucks are at with the dates. My date was a perfect gentleman once we finally met up. Before that, he was two hours late and got lost locating my house on Eastern Parkway, a MAJOR street in Brooklyn. He did win points for the gorgeous pink and lilac roses he had for me which were beautifully arranged. He took me to a nice dinner and a movie DEEP in Sheepshead Bay, an area of Brooklyn I have yet to navigate. Too bad his conversation was not up to par, another reason the young guys will always lose. When you were practically born yesterday, you have nothing to talk about so you are not interesting yet. I love a man to inquire about me but if you can't show me why your life is unique and interesting, I never want to talk to you again. I have three dogs I can have a one sided conversation with and they are each easier on the eyes than any man I have ever met (except for you Becks).   So I am apologizing in advance but to the NY youngin' we will never go out again and its not because you were two hours late. On the other hand, I am ready to take some day trips to D.C. to see my youngin' down there. Does anyone know of a Chinatown bus that goes there cheap, similarly to the Boston bus?

      This post is for Shareef and anyone else who has a problem with the fact that I prefer men older than me (30 and up to be more precise). Below are my reasons:  1. I am at an  urlLink age of commitment  and I want a man who is as well. 2. I do not want children so I prefer to date a men who already has children or realizes they are overrated. I find that this is more likely to happen after 30 rather than before. My hope is to be a second wife. 3. Females mature faster than males (do some research on  urlLink puberty  if you don't believe me) 4. An older person, especially a male is more likely to be financially stable than a younger male recently out of college. It is a fact that  urlLink earning power  increases with age. No I am not a gold digger, but the things I like to do cost money. 5. An older man has had more intimate experiences in his lifetime and is no longer on a quest to score.  I hope this helps you understand why some women like an older man. But I will let you know how these two new young bucks fare. They could change my mind completely or make me never look at a young boy again. Don't worry - when I am 30-35 and have a really stable financial cushion, I am going to scour the Ivy campuses for new hot freshman.

      Well last night I went out with the guy I met at Moe's, who also happens to work there. Those of you who read this blog consistently know who I am referring to. Going forward he will be referred to as "Moe". He claims to never pick people up at his bar - he is one of the managers (riiiiiight, if you picked me up, you pick up others) and that he has been seeing me in the bar for over a year and watching me and my mannerisms the entire time (a bit creepy if you ask me). I thought he was kidding until he described every guy I had ever been in there with and every outfit I had on when I have gone there (really, really creepy). Looking past that, we had a great conversation and a good time together until he informed me that our get together was not a proper date but rather an "informational session" to determine if in fact I was worthy of a date with him (I am, but due to scheduling conflicts that won't happen at least until Tuesday). My ex used to always tell me, you never know who is watching and boy was he right.   Up to bat tonight is a new guy from match. He is young (another 24 year old) but impressed me enough with his writing style and ambition to let me consider him. He has his own business (another techie) and works for Hotjobs (perhaps he can get a hot job for me). Will post with updates later.

      I had a blast in D.C. I had such a good night yesterday with some folks from the firm's office there that I decided to come home Friday afternoon to recover and sleep it off. Those summer associates sure know how to drink! Well I really fell hard for a new sweet guy from the office there. Stats - 6'1, white, originally from Rochester, lives in Annapolis and writes shorts stories and poetry in addition to his day job. Has been published six times. We talked a lot last month during my time in the office for my event during Reagan's funeral (see June 2004 posts), but I had no idea he was interested. I sent him an e-mail letting him know I would be down there last month and without further contact from me for over three weeks, he remembered he wanted to hang out with me last night and even cancelled plans to attend a good friend's going away party to be with me instead. I can't believe any of what happened last night (which I won't go into) because I can't fathom that I am interested in someone who is 24 years old!!!!!! Everyone who knows me, knows that you have to pretty much be over 30 to even get the time of day. What makes my new D.C. friend different is that he is so well read and he is a really good writer. To boot, who doesn't love a guy that reads the New Yorker? It looks like I may be spending more time than I thought in D.C. coming up....At least I know what to do with those 5 vacation days I have left.  Thanks to my fellow Cuban events chica in D.C. for showing me the best time last night after the meeting. We hit all the downtown D.C. hot spots and even chatted up some agents and CIA folks. It is so sexy dating men who carry guns. I guess that explains my fascination with Officer London.  Well I am off to take a nap and get ready for my date with the guy who works at Moe's, my favorite place to get a drink in Fort Greene. I'll post later with details.

      Well things are sounding okay with the job at the bank as a corporate event planner. I hit a snag in the road when the feedback from the headhunter was positive, but the interviewer said I didn't sound like I really wanted to work at "Company X". Who the hell is in the job market with one company in mind they want to work for??? If you do that, you are certain to set yourself up for disappointment. Well this headhunter and the woman I interviewed with had no idea I know some VPs on a social level there. They will now after 2 friends made some phone calls to the boss of the woman I met with to plug me. Don't you love friends who do you favors unprompted? To top it off, I also wrote a sappy kiss ass letter about how much I want to work there so I hope it works out. Now that there was an obstacle, I want the job more than ever. The fact that the events budget sounds unlimited didn't hurt matters either. Can you say McAllen 25 year old scotch and vintage champagne at networking cocktails on a private rented boat? My events portfolio would be sick after this job.  So Officer London and I went on a date Monday and I my phone started to vibrate while we were enjoying mojitos at Sushi Samba. The following conversation ensued:  Officer London: Who is sending you a text message? Me: No one you know. Officer London: Well excuse me. I guess that means you don't want to tell me. Me: Well don't take it personal, but if I dropped a name, you wouldn't know it. Officer London: Are you dating other people? Me: Of course. We never established an exclusive relationship. You aren't seeing other women? Officer London: No. Me: Why? Officer London: Well once I met you, I found what I was looking for. Me: That's sweet of you to say, but I have made the mistake of assuming I was the only one and found myself a little too emotionally involved with a man who was not emtionally attached to me. Now, I just play the field until someone initiates the "Boyfriend" conversation. Officer London: So how many guys are you seeing? Me: (thinking to myself if the new Morris Chestnut guy counts) Well, not many, I really am queen of the first date.  You can't win with men. Either you are trying to make them settle down or you are not settled down enough with them. How dare anyone assume I am not dating. Hello mofo, I met you online!!! You think you are the only guy who winked at me on match??? I like Officer London, but his tardiness to pick me up only makes him lose points to becoming my man. I hope he is reading - 6:00 p.m. means 6 not 6:22. I do not like to wait on anyone. I have left my best friend for being late. Maybe he needs me to buy him a new watch?  No posts for a few days. I am heading back to Chocolate City. I do have all new dates with new men planned for the weekend (my new thing in a new city is to find men in that city to hang out with before I go!) so I will keep you posted next week - or sooner if IT comes through with my loaner laptop. Never do business work with your own equipment. If you break it, they paid for it!

      Thanks to Josh for hosting a usual banging BBQ with good food, good people and ALCOHOL!!! I met a potential new dating prospect, a Morris Chestnut look a like who is a Michigan B-School student and working at the company I have been trying to get a foot in the door at - American Express. My boy Matt recently had an interview there as well which I hope works out for him. Sabby and I had a great time flirting and mingling - I am very glad I did not bring Officer London with me. Then we moved the party to Moe's and I finally gave my number to the cute bouncer who always gives me free drinks when I go there. Good move for me - bad move as now I have to figure out where to meet the blind internet dates I set-up.  Well every now and then I check out my ex-boyfriend's website (he is a big mixtape DJ) and wonder why I ever let another ex ruin that potential for me. The DJ was a cute sweet white boy, but the one who had my heart came back around and I cut the DJ loose like a bad habit. So, it kind of sucks to read on his website his trips to Japan, Hawaii and Iraq performing shows because I know if things has worked out with him, I would have been right there with him. The other ex still doesn't know that I cost the DJ over $1000 on a cancelled ticket to Japan for a trip we were going to take together for a show. I guess the moral for me sharing this is, never leave a good thing for someone who already had a chance with you. Men love to show interest once they see someone else wants/has you. My advice - play along, but never give up one person for another when you can always just date both of them.  I have to remind myself of this now that I hung out with the ex a few times and he may or may not be looking at me as more than just a friend again. Now that I am finally getting out there on the scene (it took me almost a year to feel ready to meet new people) and dating lots of great guys now, I would be a fool not to pursue those options for a man who had my heart and tossed it in the trash without any concern for me. I am not bitter - just realistic.  Enjoy the rest of the day off (it was a day off for me anyway)!

      How true is this  urlLink post ? For those of you that have ever been madly in love, why is it that as much as you want to be one with them, you also want them to die a gruesome death? The only two men I have ever loved, I felt that way about. I guess that line between hate and love really is thin.

      Well, my new cop friend finally found his way back to American soil. I haven't seen him yet but as long as he has my Cadbury fruit and nut bar, I will be excited to meet up.   I enjoyed my two favorite activities on a long hot afternoon (besides cuddling in a room with A/C) - shopping and BBQing. I know that I am getting old when I fall asleep after two beers. My friend, his cousin and I tried to sit down and watch the subway series at around 9 p.m., next thing you know their Yellow Lab Sandy is licking my face to wake me up and its 11:30 p.m.! I wasn't even drunk.  Anyway, I must cut the beer out of my diet because I am starting the get one of those pouches that women get after they have had kids which is disgusting. Who can be motivated to hit the gym when its so hot out???   Enjoy your fourth of July if I don't post anymore this long weekend.

      Well the ad agency job did not pan out. Apparently I am a square peg trying to get into a round hole (i.e., I come from a loser boring industry, legal, and could never bring anything positive to their creative role). Fuck them! So I did what I do best - rolled into an interview at one of the biggest baddest firms on "the street" - that's Wall Street for you non-corporate types - and wowed the hell out of them. I am in the running for a job as a corporate event planner where I would be on a team of 10 and run my own job for a change. The woman who would be my superior and interviewed me today happens to be best friends with an attorney at my firm who I just did some work for last week - go figure! It seems like a cool, odd coincidence. Luckily my interview was in the afternoon.  Thanks Steve for getting me fucked up with a pitcher of margaritas from Mary Ann's the night before the big interview. I was glad to see him one-on-one, talk to him and catch up with the friendship we have sustained for all these years.  Tonight I hooked up with another friend Sabby who I have not seen in over a year. She is still cute as ever and exotic as ever and is finally selling her art. GO SABBY!!! It's the best feeling in the world to fall in love with friends all over again.  Last bit of info for the night - my new cop friend missed his flight home from London :o( So he won't be returning until tomorrow. I missed his call to tell him he was taking me to see Dave Chappelle at Westbury on Saturday.

      I booked a room at the  urlLink Rouge Hotel  for the Writer and I for our next weekend together. It’s a very sexy hotel and is a sister hotel of the  urlLink Hotel Helix  where we stayed last month.  I have been asked to submit to participate in a dating/erotic live reading at Stand Up NY on Sept. 14th (if you are interested, contact  urlLink tess@networkinggirl.com  – She also has a blog with great stories at  urlLink http://networkinggirl.blogspot.com/ . I received the e-mail today with all the details and I must say for one of the few times in my life I am scared. I saw the word press and I immediately got nervous. I am a brazen woman who backs down from nothing but the thought of a personal story being immortalized in some media form with my real name and image attached to it was a bit much. You might be thinking, “That’s what you do on this blog.” In fact, this blog is a small portion of all that I experience in a day. I do take the liberty to edit a story to my liking; after all, a girl has to have some secrets. I sometimes wonder about the impression my blog gives to men who I have gone out with who read it. I am a very liberal gal who also happens to have a conservative streak (I work at a law firm, I went to  urlLink prep school , I love wearing suits, I am a registered republican, don’t worry I hate Bush too). Sometimes I think people who read this might think I am a serial dater (as one guy told me) or a playgirl. In all honesty I am just a girl who is getting over a broken heart by playing the field in hopes of finding a guy I can fall in love with again. Since that is not going to happen over night, I just enjoy the male company that I can, when I can.  So as I find more and more blogs to read each day (notice the growing blog roll – I can’t keep up) I always wonder about the people behind those blogs. How old are they? What did they study in school? What do they do for a living? How tall are they? What do they look like? Why do they blog? What are their goals? I am sure people are thinking the same thing if they stumble across my blog. So, I have decided to give you the opportunity to change that. Every reader is entitled to ask me three questions which I will answer honestly (I’m a Leo, we don’t shy from the truth) and quickly (within 24 hours). Simply leave your question in the comments section or send me an e-mail to  urlLink bitchinbuttercup@yahoo.com .

      So after dinner with my friend Steve at  urlLink Cuba Libre  to celebrate my belated birthday and exchange gifts from our recent travels, I received a blank voicemail. Checking the call from number I see it was from the Writer so I rang him back. He was still at the office and he just wanted to chat, but when he got my voicemail he didn't know what to say so he paused for so long he just hung up. During our convo he kept asking if I was sure I was coming down and if I was going to make time to see him. It felt really nice to have someone looking forward to see me - besides Snoopy of course. We talked later when he got off of work and let's just say a very sexy conversation ensued. He has been busy at work and unable to write so he was very frustrated. I did what I could from NY to help him through that. The Writer slept like a baby last night.

      Well it seems that two guys I use to date are both going to be in Miami, together, on labor day weekend when I plan to be there. Did I mention they are cousins? What did I do to deserve this? As a side tip - Never date guys who are related unless you are doing it out of revenge.  Let's just say that the last time we were all in South Beach at the same time, drama and mayhem ensued. Hopefully South Beach is big enough for everyone. My "brother" knows all the promoters so needless to say we get into all the parties free with no waiting in line. Last time we allowed them to ride our coat tails. This time, we will be waving at them as "We don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us and we walk around the metal detectors..." Remy Martin said it best.

      Last night the Lawyer and I hung out. As per the lawyer, you can't have an official "date" with him until you have had four prior "meet-ups". So, this being our second time meeting up, I have to see him two more times before we have an official date - whatever! He also has rules about not kissing until the first date. He broke that rule too last night. We went to a party at Flow. It was a cute spot with a cool crowd and an open bar - needless to say Lawyer got twisted. Poor thing can't hold a drink to save his life :o( I can't believe I am digging a lawyer. He even has a little belly which secretly I love on guys. I like the mini version of the beer belly over the six pack any day.

      This is the proof that I have my camera back. It's not the best picture, but what do you expect from someone who probably had no clue about the instruction I gave to take my picture due to the language barrier. This is me in Spain!!!! Yes, I got my luggage back about 10 minutes ago. And I must go welcome back all my stuff!  urlLink

      I am finally starting to feel back into the swing of things. Work still sucks. A woman in my dept. quit yesterday. I think she was on her way to getting fired and just wanted to beat them to the punch. I am very jealous of her right now, but I know my career situation will work itself out if I have patience and stay focused.  The Lawyer and I had a lovely conversation on Monday for about 3 hours. It has been a long time since I have talked on the phone with a boy (well, he is 33) for that long. I felt like a teenager with a crush, it was really refreshing. Last night I went to  urlLink Cafe Noir  with Moe, then to Moe's and we capped off the night at  urlLink Scopella . We have a good time together, but it's a bit presumptuous to tell someone when you leave them, "You know you are going to be my woman. I hope you know that's where this is going." If I said the same thing to a guy, he would be running so fast I would only remember him as a blur. I have to remember to pace myself with him so I don't get accused of leading him on a la Officer London. He is a good kisser, so I didn't care and after 3 Frozen Mojitos and 2 rum and cokes, I didn't care. But kissing is still innocent, isn't it.  I finally booked my ticket to Miami for Labor Day weekend and my ticket to D.C. to see the Writer. I am getting a bit antsy about being back in NY - I always feel like I should be planning a trip the minute I get back from one. These may be my last personal trips once my work load picks up this fall.  I actually had a good day at work today  Meetings - 3 Free Lunch - 1 Duration of Free Lunch - 2 hours Work - 0  Luggage Update - Luggage was sent to my work where it was rejected by security because they wanted to remove my luggage luck. I am shocked it had gone all this way without those airport security folks opening it. I also work very close to Grand Central and with the recent terror threats I guess my building is trying to be safe. So now my luggage has gone back to JFK, I was called with this update and now have to wait for it to be re-delivered back to my apartment. Thank God I live in a doorman building :o) I can't wait to unpack and welcome all my clothes and shoes back with a kiss.

      My luggage has been found!!!!! I haven't skipped in years and I skipped all up and down my hallway. This according to the man on the phone who hopefully wasn't lying. He said the bag has to go through customs first but then I could come and pick it up - I don't trust them delivering it. I will post again when the luggage is officially in my hands!!! I am so happy I didn't have to kill any airline employees. I plan to stay out of jail for at least the remainder of the year. I am 26 now afterall. I guess I am supposed to start acting like an adult. Thanks to my sweet boss who let me leave today at noon since I have yet to go to sleep with anxiety over this luggage.   Update : My bag is still at Heathrow. Lying British Airways bastards!! I made them give me $100 for the trouble of gong to JFK and back without my shit. They say they will courier it to me first thing tomorrow after it lands. We shall see.....

      So much to say, I don't know where to start. This blog will be a ramble. I don't know why I feel the need to say that shit cause it's my blog and I'll ramble if I want to.  The European cable in the hotel was crazy. I didn't realize so many rap videos have X rated versions. Why not cut to the chase and just have a real porn with the rappers fucking chicks and the music playing in the background. Then at least there could be some equal opportunity nudity. Nelly, Ludacris and 50 Cent are all guilty. I am sure there were more but I did not spend my vacation in front of the T.V.  Why don't Spaniards speak English. If England/the U.K. was the original hegemon and the U.S. holds the current position, why didn't we make mother fuckers learn English after we came through taking shit over? I want some answers. Can you tell I am bitter because my Spanish sucks? Yeah, yeah I am part Cuban, Panamanian and African-American, but my accent says gringo the minute I speak Spanish.  Be careful with shrimp/prawns in Spain. A lot of them come with the head and tentacles in place. YUK!!!  Best things about Spain - I was able to tan the breasts with no problems. Too bad it took me a few days to realize that, so I still have bikini lines on top which are different colors than the bottom. Must go to the salon to fix that this week. Bars in Spain sell Havana Club rum (Cuban baby!!!). The shopping was off the chain. I spent way too much money. Can someone explain why I purchased about 200 Euro worth of lingerie from  urlLink this spot . We need one of these chains in the states.  Worst things about Spain - they party til 7 a.m. which definitely showed me how old I am getting. A lot of men sweat too much in the heat and don't smell good as a result ( I took about 4 showers a day there, man is my skin dry :o(I found a better Italian restaurant than I did a Spanish restaurant. I guess I love my rice and beans. I think poor people make better food because they appreciate it more. Hence better food in places like Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Cuba. Also, I didn't get as dark as I wanted. My dermatologist put the fear of God in me when she mentioned that even black people get skin cancer. I had no clue. What good is all this melanin if it doesn't protect you from the sun or the police :o)  Did anyone know that Lil Kim, Keith Murray and Young MC have NEW videos out? Apparently if you fall off over here you are still hot over there - the Europeans love black music.  All in all, I had a fab time. Next big solo vacation will be to Italy and perhaps Paris. Hopefully the dollar will get better so I can really leave with just a purse and come back with a new wardrobe (and maybe even a sexy Italian boyfriend). All this talk and I forgot to mention that British Airways lost a piece of my luggage. The one with all the clothes I took with me plus all the new shit I purchased. Not to mention a few irreplaceable pairs of Choo's (the infamous butterfly sandal) and Blahnik's (the Gisele S&M shoe). Needless to say I am pissed. I am trying to think positively about it so you don't have to read about Buttercup going to jail because she killed some British Airways employee. I wonder if I could get off for insanity for that.... I am a bonafide NYer, I have a shrink who would sign a paper confirming my insanity.
