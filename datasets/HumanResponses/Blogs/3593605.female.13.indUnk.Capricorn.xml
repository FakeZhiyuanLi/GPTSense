          hi... got nothing to say... -_-" right? Aiyah who cares??? I forgot to tell my friends that I changed my blog... damn it!!! Even worst, I lost their email addresses!!! Nvm, luckily there is the new technology...HANDPHONES!!! See? who says handphones are bad??? They rock k???   Anyway, I hate the name of my blog... wanna change it to moderncleo.blogspot.com... You know why??? Coz my sister says that I'm as spoilt as cleopatra... so what??? At least I've got the talent to be one...lolx...jkjk.  Man... there's one thing that sucks about school but they're changing it coz they changed the school system a bit... See, now they don't let us go back to the hostel when we finished classes early and we are only allowed in after 2:15pm... so what do we have to do??? We MUST stay in the library or the dining hall until the bell goes...sucky right???  BUT now, they're opening the computer lab during school-time and we are allowed to use the computers any time we want to BUT then there is another problem, they blocked websites like friendster, pitas and loadz of other nice and cool websites... WHY??? Because they think that if we go to friendster, we won't take note of the time and use the computers for too long and they will have a bill to pay!!! haha. lolx. jkjk.  Reason??? I don't know. muahahas. lolx. haha. Can't stop laughing... Well, that's all folks!!! lolx. Nothing to say liaoz... gtg... Bye!!! See you soon!!!

          Ah!!!! Lemme tell u what disgusting thing happened this week!!!! When I went to the dining hall for dinner a few days back, I was very excited cos there was going to be curry chicken and I LOVE curry!!! Anyway, I as eating halfway when a bird dropped right in front of me... so I leaned over to scare it away... when I looked at it, I was very surprised on why it didn't move... I looked at my friend in front of me with a questioning look in my eyes... and she looked HORRIFIED!!! She stared under my table and asked me to look...guess what I saw... I saw....  The bird's head!!! It got chopped off by the fan!!! And the throat was red and sticking out of the bird's head!!!  That's why it "flew" pass me!!! Then my friend said that the body landed in one piece and the head rolled towards me and it was about one feet away from MY feet!!!! Ah!!!  Immediately, I took my plate and dumped the food away... I couldn't eat anymore... AND I was starting on the chicken in fact... Man... can't stand it anymore...now I never dare to look at another sparrow again... Moral of the "story": I don't know... don't eat anymore curry??? *shrugs shoulder*
