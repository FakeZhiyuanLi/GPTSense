       woke up at the usual crack of dawn, and that is too blasphemous on a saturday.&nbsp; with nothing else on my mind i went to the gym.&nbsp; spent the best of the latter part of the work week looking at dance websites.&nbsp; from the time i was three to about age 24 i danced then taught ballet.&nbsp; constantly.&nbsp; i have been thinking about starting again... and spent a lot of work time on the internet looking at classes.   i really want to perform again.&nbsp; i have been out of the loop technically and physically for so long that it will be a bit before i am technically (as in technique) ready to step a foot on a stage.&nbsp; however, being tattooed... my chances of performing are limited.&nbsp; drastically limited... unless i learn how to be especially crafty with stage makeup.&nbsp; but then again, i love my tattoos! &nbsp;maybe i will be happy with just taking ballet and modern classes.&nbsp; there is just something so special about being in front on a stage tho.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      this work day will not officially end.   on the mother front: good news!     mom came home from the hospital yesterday.&nbsp; she is now being administered this chemotherapy that is composed of the three strongest chemos on the market today; it will take 8 hours to drip in.&nbsp; i figure that its gotta kill off some brain cells as well.&nbsp; chemotherapy causes "brain fog" and mother is quite forgetful and odd acting at times.&nbsp; however, in its defense... all chemo is nasty strong chemicals pumped into the body to try to kill off what is killing its host.

      oops.&nbsp; long time since i updated.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  my mother is in the hospital - very dehydrated and will get a new chemotherapy administered while she is admitted.&nbsp; it will take 6 hours to drip in.&nbsp; lord.&nbsp; my father called me at work and left a very doom and gloom voicemail saying that she had been admitted.&nbsp; proceeded to spend the next 15-30 minutes calling the hospital frantically, being transferred from station to station.&nbsp; she does sound like she is in good spirits.

       urlLink swatch  has this new watch that has bunnies in various karma sutra positions, and i am just about willing to sell my cat jake into kitty slavery for the $$55 smackers to buy it.  assuming that the stores carry said watch, i am there wednesday at lunch time to buy it.  i NEED that watch.    work today was insanely uneventful.  i have a very good friend at the office who has too many health problems for one woman to have.  she has a pituitary tumor in her brain, and assorted other equally as bad maladies.  this tumor on the gland will every once and a while effect her speech pattern and voice, totally distorting it.  and it is the most awful experience.  i can understand her fairly well when the speech is effected, although it does take a bit of getting used to it.  bless her little heart.    lately i have been extremely moody and not a happy camper.  but tonight that will all change, because tonight,  urlLink I Love the '90's in on vh1 all week , and  urlLink Big Brother  is on this week as well! if you watch the very first episode... you will 9 chances outta 10 be hooked and subconsciously desire to watch all the rest of them.   mark and i caught the first episode last week, and now will be sucked in (i already am) and watch the entire season.    its time for a little cold pizza and kool-aid (made with splenda. splenda rocks!)

      it is sunday. i do not feel well at all.  i was supposed to go out to see my mother and father today, but since i do not feel 100%, i don't want to get out there and chance making my mother ill.  she is fighting breast cancer, and has been since 1998.  it has rapidly spread to the abdomen and the colon, and now she has "freefloating" breast cancer cells on her cervix.  so it has been a nasty, what seems to be never-ending battle.    i feel a bit guilty for not going out.  but even if i have the tiniest bug or illness i don't want to chance making her sick.  i will take mark (the boyfriend) out with me one night this week after work to go see them.  i am going to use this blog as both an experiment and therapy.  i want to use it to let my thoughts out (as i tend to keep them bottled up) and also to chronolog my artistic endeavors.  for 20 of my 27 year old life, i danced ballet and modern dance.  i quit when my lifelong teacher became nastily hooked on coke and lost the studio.  i have been thinking for the past year that i should get up the gall and take classes again, mainly in the modern, contemporary dance field.  i doubtfully would ever be at a point again to join a performing company (especially since i am riddled with tattoos), i miss performing greatly... but attempting classes again might give me some form of sanity.  i will also be painting more... mainly acrylic and watercolor.... and i will use the blog to talk about my classes at the  urlLink art league of houston  and the glassell school at the museum of fine arts.
