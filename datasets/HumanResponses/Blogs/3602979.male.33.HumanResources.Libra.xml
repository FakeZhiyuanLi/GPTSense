      I just got AIM-my screenname is snevetsnosila, which is my name backwards.   I am desperately waiting for people to be on at the same time as me and for Paula to get back.  I think we could use some livening up from her.

      Damn, Nathan.  I'm real sorry.  I'm tired too.  Staven told me some of what's depressing you.  I thought I had it bad.  You are much worse off than me.  You have every right in the world to be depressed.  I'm sorry I yelled at you.  Edit: If anysone sees nathan, tell him I'm real sorry.

      This is from someone who works with my mom to my mom:  Brief Guide to U.S. Newspapers   1.  The Wall Street Journal is read by the people who run the country.   2.  The Washington Post is read by people who think they run the country.   3.  The New York Times is read by people who think they should run the  country and who are very good at crossword puzzles.   4.  USA Today is read by people who think they ought to run the country but  don't really understand The New York Times.  They do, however, like their  statistics shown in pie charts.   5.  The Los Angeles Times is read by people who wouldn't mind running the  country - if they could find the time - and if they didn't have to leave  Southern California to do it.   6.  The Boston Globe is read by people whose parents used to run the country  and did a far superior job of it, thank you very much.   7.  The New York Daily News is read by people who aren't too sure who's  running the country and don't really care as long as they can get a seat on  the train.   8.  The New York Post is read by people who don't care who's running the  country as long as they do something really scandalous, preferably while  intoxicated.   9.  The Miami Herald is read by people who are running another country but  need the baseball scores.   10. The San Francisco Chronicle is read by people who aren't sure there is a  country... or that anyone is running it; but if so, they oppose all that  they stand for.  There are occasional exceptions if the leaders are  handicapped minority feminist atheist dwarfs who also happen to be illegal  aliens from any other country or galaxy, provided of course, that they are  not Republicans.   11. The National Enquirer is read by people trapped in line at the grocery  store.  He sent more stuff; I'll post that later.

Why is it so hard for people to give up their illusions?  8. Becasue illusions are like drugs (Yes they contain nicotine!)   9. What exactly is WRONG with most of my relitives?  9. They are related to you!(Duh)   10. Why is Ronnie (my ex uncle) such a ####ing #######??  10. Because he's related to you...I already answered that question   11.

Why am I getting so worked up over a stupid cricket?  17. Cause you need coffee! StarBucks Coffee!   18. What makes people so close-minded?  18. Society! For example people hate Bush so much they don't relize that Kerry is dumber!   19. What's wrong with me right now?  19. Your face!   P.S. I just feel weird now.

      Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I am Hyalpoterous Lemure and I will be your host this evening.  Today on "An Evening with Hyalpoterous Lemure"  we will be discussing my name.  "Hyalpoterous" is an adjective meaning "Glittery-winged" and "Lemure" is a noun, a type of spirit that exists in the material world.  So, I am a Glittery-Winged Spirit.  My real name exists.

      Dana the Wonderful????????? How curious. I need a decent name like *Galaxy* or c00kie monster.  If someone has an idea other than Ms. Genius-*sticks tongue out at Nathan/c00kie monster/joebob trivionie*-or something similar, tell me.

      Alison says hi to *Galaxy* and reminds her that she was going to call Alison.  "Ms. Genius" looks down her nose at Nathan-which doesn't work because he's taller than me-what kind of rank is Ms. Genius anyway??? Alison also says hi to Dana, and thinks she should be Daine, because that's who she is.   Alison says Puffin to Garrett and muffin to ryan, and nothing to parker.  Sorry parker.

      After studying Math all morning I finally got around to adding a cursor to the page (Don't make fun of it I like it!). Also The do not Click button. I was going to as a Javascript game but I was tired and really not up to it. I think that there is music so you might want to turn down the volume cause it really blares across the sound system. In case you were wondering its from Chrono Trigger (Frongs Theme). Anyway I just wanted to notify you people that my birthday is however many days away it is. I think I confused myself. Well anyway thats all for now.

      Ok so after i fought through the old mushrooms and mystery meat in crappy hot and sour soup, I faced another obsticle today, REALLY REALLY DUMB PEOPLE! ok so I was supposed to go to this "mid school social" for the church, so its a pool party and games right, what could go wrong? well first problem is we couldn't find the place, after all it was in Coralles, so the instrutions were very un-clear, so we called them right, and guess what they said that we should go "south" on largo loma so we went o say 5 miles down that road (south of couse) BUT failed to find the street they were talking about so we called them again and not realizing (even though we gave them the streets we were close to) they wanted to know the color of our car and model, so they could wave to us,(imagine how many people this idiot waved to) turns out we were about 5 miles from where we were supposed to be, now we had his wife on the phone, who we now know evidently din't know her cardial diretions and they said to go find alemeda, the closest big street near them, witch was actually NORTH! ok so we've wasted an hour now just trying to find the place so we finally come to the street they wanted us to, the directions said that we were supposed to look for the house with ballons out front, so we drive all the way up the street and no ballons, so we give them another ring (3rd time) and they say they're 3/4ths of a mile up the street so we go back to the start of the street to start recording our mileage and hey whadda know i see someone from my church sliding down the water slide, (we are at the BEGINING of the street) and we realize thats the party so we watch the place to see if my friends are they, convienintly none are and we decide to go back home without going to the party. moral of the story, always stop by the house (even though u spent an hour and a half searching for it) WHY??! u say? so u can find out what kind of people could be SO DUMB!! also i personally think there should be a national >75 IQ BLACKLIST! I'm sure they would quailify, and watch out for dumb people, they're all around you!

      Ok so i was at camp for like a week and now i just got back and i've really thought hard up there about the "east coast culture" read the whole article plz. OK so my step mom is like the fakiest person in the whole world like seriously i mean she has like a different face for everyone, like for me her face is "in my eyes ur just a toddler and u better do what i say" and to my dad she's like "I'm ur loving houseservent i mean housewife and me cheat on u? hell no" and to peeps at her "fancy parties" (where upper middle class peeps she knows like to pretend they're all upper class) she's all "I'm a better cook than all of the women, i'm a more loving and devoted housewife than you are, me and john's (johns my dad) relationship will last forver" and my dad, (just as fake, remember that almost all of the upper middle classmen like to fake and be everything to everyone) puts on the "HA! i got a job, a blonde for a housewife, I'm making like 20 more Grand than u are" kinda look towards all of the men, and he's like the charmer to all the women so they can take turns telling Janet how lucky she was to get him as a husband. OK so now to the meal, first we have wine tasting, even though no one is even close to a good wine taster, and never get it right they swap "intelligent" remarks about the wine, but hey i get to wine taste too so i'll stop bitching on that, so we move on to hors durves, which really taste like crap BUT remember we're upper class now so we have to pretend we like them and make remarkes about they like "too much spinitch" and crap like that, ok so now we're ready for the main meal, OH?! no turkey? no us upper class people need to pretend like we're losin whight and we'll just have some cold sandwiches with fancy mustard and "YAY!! I GET MORE WINE!" time for some toasting to the great peeps john and janet uray! (even though most peeps just want to act like they're best of friends because all rich people need to be friends ya know) so the next moring, YAY ITS CHRISTMAS!!! I start opening my presents and what do i have????! ITS A F'N ROBOT KIT!!! what do they think i am like a hardcore nerd??? I'm a sk8r who writes on the net when i'm bored, so anyway i have this ROBOT KIT!! in my hands and what do i have to tell my dad, what i think(DAD!! u idiot! what the hell did i do that makes u think i deserve a ROBOT KIT!!!) what i say( o thanks dad i'm sure i'll have fun with this) also i then i think (heheh i'll have a blast selling this on ebay) so now i think the reason he bought the kit was so he could show off to his co-workers "oh your kid got a new RC car??" "my kid got a robot kit cause he has a brain!!" so apparently he had told Peter (my uncle)  about this about 2 weeks before christmas and not wanting to be outdone Peter gets me a gift card to the discovery store for 50$!!! so this leads to the title "New Jersey Jocks" every man out there has to prove he can one-up the other and fake his moods just to be accepted, I MEAN COME ON! put the f'n testosterone away and get serious! real friends don't fake, lie and bluff their way into respect! QUIT JOCKING AROUND! QUIT THE ONE-UPMANSHIP! JUST BE YOURSELF! OMG I H8 everyone there so f'n fake i can't take it!

The other boy replied, "Well, you know how Santa Claus turned out. It's probably just your Dad.  Post jokes you guys have heard recently.

      I was sitting on my bed reading when our cat ran in, followed closely by one of our border collies, who was also followed by another of our border collies. and while those three animals are in my room, our beagle is howling at the thunder in the summer of Santa Fe. oh, and did I forget to mention the two snakes in their respective cages in my room, and the other border collie that was growling at the other two in my room at the time?

      This is a little story I heard today:  One of the girls in my sewing class is making a stuffed frog named Fufu.  She was telling her brother about it, and he's like "Fufu?" And Leandra-that's the girl's name-says, "yes, Fufu, F-U-F-U."    Edit by Admin: Hehe we have been such a bad influence! anyway I'm to lazy to make a new post so I'll just stick it here. WE JUST GOT RATED A 2 OUT OF 10 ON THE GOOGLE TOOLBAR! MOST PERSONAL SITES AND BLOGS ARE 0'S 2/10 WERE GETTING SOMEWHERE!

      why the heck are we having campaigns to become admins? I think it is rather pointless.  Ryan: No because he is an annoying nerd with a rat-tail. Uber Stev: No because he doesn't know how to spell, or is just a lazy bump on a log. Alison: No because she doesn't want to. Garrett: No because he is an annoying "nerd" that has a mullett. Dana: No because she continually asks pointless questions and never posts. Paula: No because she is always confused, hyper, and in desperate need of help. Nathan: No because he already is an admin. Myself: No because my goal is to undermine everyone else's campaign platform.  Thank You All For Listening To Me Today!

       Uber Stev needs you to vote him for the next admin, Y elect a jock? cause nerds r no fun! oops there goes my "voter base", Just Kidding! i don't care what crowd you hang out with, just vote for me cause i'm a fun loving person who likes to take long walks on the beach zzzzzz.... enough of the serious stuff, i'd have plenty of time to monitor the blog and could change the music daily.  By the way i wanna vote for Ryan, cause knowing HTML and java script could help out, bye the way ryan if u wanna "parter up" for that deathmatch thing i'd be cool wit me.  Ok time for the raid and pillage part, I'd like to take pot shot at paula, (yes nate this hate campain is neccisary) DON'T ELECT PAULA, Y she's negative and much like kerry,  (the real reason i don't want her in is cause she pissed at me) but thats beside the point!

      Jk antony ok so here's the joke:      So A man is watching TV and his wife asks him to    fix the stairs, they look like they're gonna fall     in any minute, So the man says "do i have plumber    written on my fore head?" So then the wife asks     the husbad to fix the sink. He replies "do i have    plumber written on my fore head"? Frustrated the     wife then asks the husband to replace the oil in    her car, her husband says "do i have mechanic     written on my forehead?" Mad at the wife the man    heads out to the bar.       A little while after arriving at the bar the man    feels bad about how he mistreated his wife and goes    back to the house and is quite suprised to see all     of the broken things fixed, so he asks his wife how     all of this was done, she replied "so after u left I    went out to find someone to fix all of the stuff, so    soon i found a nice young man to do it for me, and I    found out all i had to do for him doing all this stuff    was either i had to give him a cake or sex" so the man    asks what kind of cake did u make him? she replied "does    it look like i have betty crocker written on my forehead?

      Nathan, when are you going to get rid of the voting box? You already said who won(and I might add that Ryan shouldn't be an admin because he hasn't posted in like a month) so it is rather pointless for it to be there.

      After much insanity, I am finally here.   I got spacers put in today, and they hurt like heck. They're these little rubber-band type things that get squished in between your back molars to make room for braces. The braces come on in 4 weeks. I also have to get this bar across the top of my mouth. Bleck. I've never had a very high tolerance for pain, so this shouldn't be too much fun.

      ...Sometimes I wonder how people think such a noble race can be evolved from monkeys, I personally think its absurd. Heh I was looking at an article yesterday, it was telling how Christians are prejudice bastards and how much we should hate them...Is it just me or does this evolutionist sound like Kerry or one of our senators? It does to me, our whole entire country is messed up. I hate it here but I am grateful for all I have, I may not like our president but I can clearly see that Kerry isn't going to win by great speeches and persuasion, he's going to win cause people hate Bush. To me that is not the marking of a good president. But we all know who are going to win, we all know how much everyone hates Bush. "OMG the economy is down and gas prices are up". The economy is run by people if we go to war and people freak out and take out all their stocks that's their problem, if Texco wants to be a butt and raise the prices to make more money that's their problem. The least you can do is not blame EVERY SINGLE FREAKING PROBLEM on Bush. You can hate him as much as you want, but I doubt if you had the chance to take down Saddam in Iraq you would let it pass. I for one know I wouldn't I attack them whether you like it or not. I would get on TV and announce it to the world that I'm going to take that dirty bastard down no matter what, even if it involves getting impeached. Then you have the fact that pacifist are say we are killing innocent women and children. I had a friend who went to Iraq, do you know who what the scariest thing there? It was the woman, it's because the woman wear the long garments and since you would violate the religion by searching at woman, it is possible for them to hide weapons in their garments. And the children are given guns and told to shoot at soldiers and it is mandatory in the US Army that if you are shot at you shoot back. So we kill these children and women and we are accused of bloody murder and that we are so cold hearted that we shoot children and women. Meh...We have soldiers that are women in Iraq, they are getting shot at. At least America has some dignity and does not use this as an excuse to say they are bloody murderers. Then we have people who compare Iraq to Vietnam. Vietnam was one of the worst wars in the history of the US we tried and we failed. Vietnam was possibly a worse war for the US than WW2 cause we had the draft and we lost men in gruesome ways. This is nothing like Vietnam. I know this will sound cruel but if I had to I would shoot women and children if they were jeopardizing other people. What can I say I have a black heart, I could kill my brother or sister without flinching, I've tried. I threw a knife at him but it didn't hit him. I haven't even felt a pang of sorrow about that day, there is not a moment when I feel guilty. I've lost it all. I couldn't care less if Bush was murdered, or if Kerry died in a car crash. I couldn't care less if you took away my computer. I couldn't care less if you banned me from reading. I don't care about anything anymore. I take one look at the country and people around me and I'm ashamed of it. I want out I want to just not be here. I have no passion, no hopes, and no dreams. I'm sick of all of it. I'm sick of the Republicans and the Democrats, I'm sick of the Christians and the Evolutionist, I'm sick of the Gays and the Straights, I'm sick of all the arguments between these people. This quote carries alot of weight in the real world...Veritas odium parit...   Audentes Fortuna Juvat Ave atque vale Nathan

      Yay! Orson Scott Card is awsome he wrote this awsome artical about the media. There was an artical about how a senetor or someone of the sort failed to mention the Abu Graihb prison scandal to the graduating class at West Point Academy. ;) how the heck does the media do they. They find the bad in everything, its crazy. Whats the guy supposed to say? "I would like to remind you that some of our alumni have been torturing prisoners! So don't do it again." Its a freaking graduation ceremony not a place to remind us of wrong doings. He could have said that but what is the point. I think they are smart enough to relize not to do that. Thats the media and Card for ya!   http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2004-05-30-1.html

      I reserve the right to edit any messages I want...Not to mention the typo in Paula's sister's posts saying we could only wish to be as dumb as her...*snicker*...Anyway I won't make you all look that stupid but be warned...Oh and by the way I'm kinda pissed about getting hit by a car so I don't want any crap about Micheal Moore or Farenhite 9/11 Anyone who is that much of an ass to make a movie like that purely for profiet has more shit in his head than Kerry and Bush combined.   Imagine this: someone makes a movie like that about Kerry...He gets his ass sued off and then all the Democrats mob him and then being typical americans we blame Bush and impeach him.   The other side: Someone makes a movie about Bush...He makes millions and people praise him and being typical americans we get pissed at Bush and impeach him....  Oh boy this is a win-win senario...I swear how the hell does this work. I suppose you all are patriotic enough to even get pissed at Reagan even though he's dead and he was republican. I can't beleive all of you, you have no sense of pride in your country. Damn democrats...You hate Bush so much you don't have time to hate Kerry or think about what your doing and where you live. Heh now Garrett is going to post some heated comment under this and ya, and all of you are going to riot and kill me and I'm going to have a field day fixing the blog. So for the remainder of the time none of you are admins cept for Steve cause he couldn't mess it up if he treid and I trust him.((Yes all of you were admins and no offense Steve but you couldn't and you know it))

      Hi guys.  Uber Stev in bold I'm Paula's way cool older sister. And I can kick all of y'all asses  Wee...Fun I'm going to find Garrett and Parker then you can come and take all of us on at once, won't that be a bottle of joy!  ! Hahaha. Hey you guys should call my sister Power Wheel...cuz it's funny. Haha ok I'm gonna post now!    Edit: I'm putting both messages from her into one. Also note that everything in italics and bold are edits to make this message funnier    Paula's cool sister again.  HEHEHE ya cool.  I forgot to say something. JUNIORS  DON'T  RULE  NOTHING WE ALL SUCK!!  ! And if you ever say anything other than that..well you'll have a bunch of people on your tail  Meh...I'd love to see that!  . But seriously. You should respect your elders  So I assume your old and wrinkly  . Paula just said are "smart people" UH REALLY SMART so I don't see why you wouldn't think that Juniors rule. Now she's scowling at me. But it's her own fault for letting me add a post. So there! And now she's whining because she didn't want to be admin. But make her do it forever 'cause that would be funny. And for now, all I have left to say is that I know you guys wish you could be as dumb as me but don't worry. You will be when you're a junior. With age comes wisdom and beauty and lots of pimples. Peace out

      I am being taken away by my parents.  We are going to the middle of nowhere.  I wil be gone for 5 days.  By the way, for the last 6 days, only 1 new post has been made per day.  Nathan, u should have told me I was an admin, I would have gotten back on!  If anyone sees anyone, tell them Ryan says "hi".  Anyone, that includes the guy at the counter at wal-mart, or that bum that hangs around your house that claims to be your brother\sister, or the guy that picks up the phone when you call the phone-psycic, or that old lady behind you in line for the roller-coaster.  So...Adios, au revior, see ya, chow, later, good bye, and good ridiance.

      Ryan, can you please, just for one month, post stuff that has nothing to do with politics? or is that impossible for you. we all have better things to do with our lives than listen to you rant and rave about Bush.

      I haven't been here for a while so I welcome myself back.  Because Nathan is gone we can bush-bash as much as we want.  So...  Going into Iraq was a stupid useless military action that got the whole world mad at us.  Not only that, but oil prices have gone up astronomically.  Before I go any farther let me elaborate.  Yes; Saddam tortured his citizens.  So does Saudi Arabia.  Why don't we invade Saudi Arabia?  Because they give us oil.  Saddam Sold oil to other middle-eastern countries, who then sold it to us.  Without Saddam, Supply goes down, demand stays the same, and prices go up.  Now about Bush's Speaking habbits:...  "They always misunderestimate me..."  "I am the master of low expectations"  "Our nation must come together to unite"  "I think we agree, the past is over."  "Home is where hope takes flight, where wings take dream."  "I'm not the sharpest marshmallow in the bag"  "the french have no word for 'entrepeneur'"  "I was raised in the west. the west of texas.  It's pretty close to california."  "I think the American people--I hope the american people--I don't think, let me--I hope the american people trust me"  "They want the federal government controlling social secutity like it's some kind of federal program."  And his administration:...  Bush is the only president to be elected with a criminal record.  He has the most convicted criminals in his cabinet.  The poorest member of his cabinet; Condoleeza Rice, is a multimillionaire, and has a chevron oil tanker named after her.  Dick Cheyney is still on the Halliburton payroll.  Bush dumped all his Enron Stock(a considerable amount) just before it crashed.  Not to mention that he was AWOL(absent with out leave) during his tour of duty with the texas national guard, which he joined to prevent himself from going to vietnam.  I could go on, but I think that is enough for today.  Go see Farenhieght 911(Nathan, I will buy you a ticket, give me when)

      1. I wish that my life wasn't as boring as school can be 2. I wish that the only thing anybody cared about was not politics 3. I wish that I didn't have to wake up at 6:45 this morning 4. I wish that I didn't have to go to school in 19 days 5. I hope that the reason nobody liked eigth grade at Academy is because they liked all the other grades better, not because it is absolutely evil, hard, and hell to go through 6. I wish that wishes came true as easily as you can find a bare spot of dirt in New Mexico

      Plz this place is not for flirting take your talk away from the sacred internet zone. Anyway to lighten up the mood. I have done noting. So read the little blurb  A priest, a minister, and a rabbi were discussing what they would like people to say after they died and their bodies were on display in open caskets. Priest: “I would like someone to say ‘He was a righteous and honest man and very generous.’” Minister: “I would like someone to say ‘He was very kind and fair, and he was very good to his parishioners.’” Rabbi: “I would want someone to say ‘Oh, look! He’s moving!’”  HAHAHA I'm so wierd slash bored and I just watched hidalgo...Then onto hellboy BWAHAHAH

      Right. SO, I have been looking over the posts, which I really don't get to do that often, and I read everywhere, particularly in Paula's(moo) posts, that everyone urges everyone else to post. So as I sit here, feeling miserably out of contact, I realize that noone has posted in the last two *************************ing days. How lonely and MISLEAD I feel. anyway, in case noone heard it the first time, POST!! NOW!! OR I WILL SNEAK INTO YOUR HOUSE AT NIGHT AND SHOVE A MOTHERBOARD AND MODEM SO FAR UP YOUR REAR END THAT YOU WILL QUITE SIMPLY BE DEAD. Thanks  -Lax
