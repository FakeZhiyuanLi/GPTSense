      Verity's opinion...  The Aboriginal community say they are regularly assaulted and are the subject of racism from the police, they witness violent raids and so it is obvious why Thomas tried to avoid the police. He merely did what any aboriginal boy of his age would do. Thomas' family say that the December before his death Thomas was accused of a crime that he didn't commit which gives an even stronger reason why he was so determined to get away from the police. Because there are so many conflicting accounts of the circumstances of Thomas' death it is unknown whether the police actually were chasing him but it is known that the NSW police had a track record for racism against the Aborigine’s, which is not justified. But even though they have a track record for this, it is not every member of the police force and it is unfair to say that this was another one of their racist action, as it could easily be that the police were just sitting there looking for another aboriginal boy whose description did not fit Thomas’s, and therefore they didn’t run after him. It could have just been Thomas’s misjudgement and the fear that drove him to cycle away at high speed and hence have the accident.  Bob Carr has made public that his support lies with the police and does not believe that they were of any cause to the death of Thomas, but I believe that Bob Carr as an authority figure should not back anyone as he does not know any information for certain as the facts are inconsistent. Also as it is a time where many people are willing and determined for reconciliation and a public apology to the Aboriginals for what our ancestors did, Bob Carr although he may have been supporting the police, shouldn't have made it public because of the uproar it would cause not just from the Aboriginals but also from other Australians as it is not a step towards reconciliation.

       urlLink    The death of Thomas (Tj) Hickey, a young Aboriginal boy of only 17 years has been of great conflict. TJ died while riding his bicycle, the exact circumstances of his death are unknown but it is sure that the New South Wales police force either directly or indirectly played a critical role in circumstances leading up to the death of the Sydney resident. The police force has record of racism and provocative behavior towards the Aboriginal community. The young boy, who was the eldest of seven children is a good example of the terrible social and economic deprivation of the aborigine's even today, although they are just youth and a  younger generation of aborigine's.  it is known that after riding his BMX to his mothers house TJ encountered the police, he rode away at high speed and soon after in doing so he fell off his bike, he fell on a metal fence and impaled himself. The police deny ever chasing TJ but they do admit that they did encounter him a short while before he crashed. The police say that they were looking for a young aboriginal boy who didn't fit TJ's description. But at least three witnesses have come forward and reported that the police's account of events is not reliable. They say that they saw the police chasing Thomas just before the fatal crash.

      The Polices Opinions  The aboriginal community is accusing the Police invlolved and the Police force in general of chasing Thomas Hickey causing him to crash. In the morning of T.J Hickey's death there was a reported 'bag snatching' at Redfern Station. The description of the 'bag snatcher'was that it was a aboriginal, young boy and that is why the police were patrolling the area.    The police denied ever chasing Thomas, although they admit seeing him shortly before the fatal crash. In a press conference held on Sunday, Inspector Bob Emery claimed that Thomas “saw the police and the police saw him, but because he wasn’t a person of interest to them they continued on their patrols.”  The police, who claim they were looking for another Aboriginal youth not fitting Thomas’s description, say that they found the terribly injured Thomas after a member of the public flag stopped passing police car. After being taken to Sydney Children’s Hospital, Thomas’s internal injuries were too bad for doctors to save him, and he died at 1 a.m. Sunday morning. The police described his death as a tragic but freak accident.  At least three witnesses have reportedly come forward to disagree with the police version of events. These witnesses claim to have seen the police chasing Thomas Hickey immediately prior to his fall on the fence.

      The life of TJ Hickey  TJ Hickey’s life represented an entire generation of Aboriginal youth. Thomas was born in ‘The block’, Redfern, Sydney. When he was 13 he moved to Walgett, a small rural town in northwest New South Wales. Like many other rural and regional towns in Australia, Walgett offers no real future for young working class people, particularly those who are of Aboriginal descent.  The town is one of the most isolated in New South Wales. There are approximately 2,000 residents, and 40 percent of them are Aboriginal. Walgett’s Aborigines are quite deprived; an example is the massive level of unemployment. In 2001, the unemployment rate for Aborigines in Walgett was 29.2 percent. TJ Hickey never experienced any employment that would help him in Walgett. His work experience was limited to unskilled and casual agricultural labouring jobs. Thomas had left school when he was just 14, after he struggled to develop his reading and writing skills. The under-education of Aboriginal youth like TJ is very common. TJ was a very keen rugby league player but found that there was no competition for him at Walgett past the under-12s level.  When TJ’s Grandmother, Elizabeth Hickey, died he was deeply affected and started getting in trouble with the local police. As a teenager TJ spent time in both Walgett and Sydney as he had relatives in both areas. Like most young aborigines in Sydney, TJ spent lots of him time in Redfern, as it has been a traditional meeting place for Aboriginals across the state of NSW for a long time. Thomas moved to Sydney in December 2000 and stayed with his aunt Virginia Hickey, in the inner-city suburb of Waterloo, adjacent to Redfern.   Within days of TJ’s arrival in Sydney, he was assaulted by police, the media described it as a case of ‘mistaken identity. Soon after this incident TJ starting committing various small crimes and he was faced with the local children’s court on charges of stealing, resisting police, and possession of a small quantity of marijuana. Soon after Thomas began to turn away from petty crimes with the help of his family and he planned to return to school to complete his education. Michael West noted that Thomas “just wanted to finish his education and to go to tech. He knew he was turning 18 and he didn’t want to end up in the ‘big house’—the jailhouse.”  The day before Thomas came of his bicycle his aunt Virginia had arranged an appointment with a local youth guidance group to assist his return to school.

      Ali’s opinion:  My opinion, concerning the death of TJ Hickey, is that his demise was entirely a result of his own judgement. I cannot understand how this issue can be viewed as racist or discriminative; when, even if Hickey’s death followed a car chase, no one forced him to impale himself on the metal fence.  It may appear to some, that the Aboriginal population within Redfern has been harassed and subjected to racial prejudice for many years prior to the accident, resulting in many attempts of escape as soon as a police car is sighted; however, I feel that this is simply an excuse for the Aboriginal people to get back at white society for the difficulties faced by them in the past.  On the other hand, as the contrasting arguments for both sides lack evidence to back them up, so I am unable to draw a conclusion based upon the given information. For instance, if the police really did have grounds for pursuing TJ Hickey on his bicycle, then why is it that they felt it necessary to cover this up, even when there were several eyewitness accounts of the pursuit? Although, what if the accounts given were biased as they came from relatives, or people in the local community? If so, then why is it that they felt enough resentment towards the police to invent this tragic story in the first place?  In the first place, however, I feel that this entire story has been inflated and retold so many times that noone really knows what happened; and I can't see the point of researching the story of a young criminal who died in an accident when a big deal would never be made about such a story if it was a white youth who had died.

      This is a notice sent by the Aboriginal community in Refern to the Australian Government requesting certain demands.        Notice to the Australian Government and the People of Australia  We, members of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people of Australia, do therefore call on individual representatives of the Australian Government both State and Federal including the Police Commissioner of NSW, to conduct an INDEPENDENT INQUIRY into the DEATH of Thomas Hickey, A YOUNG SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD ABORIGINAL BOY from the Redfern and Walgett communities of  NSW. This inquiry to incorporate the events leading to the HEART WRENCHING REACTION of his community.  We demand that the inquiry be conducted by independent Aboriginal Consultants and not friends of the government and the police commissioner. We don’t want a WHITE WASH similar to the BLACK DEATHS IN CUSTODY ROYAL COMMISSION. We demand that the truth be told on how a young Aboriginal boy can die while riding his pushbike within his community.   Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people within Australia are aware of the RACISM and INJUSTICES continually faced by Aboriginal people today specifically our young people in communities such as Redfern.   We give notice to the Australian government both State and Federal that the continual denial of BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS and on-going POLICE HARASSMENT against Aboriginal people have not been addressed in this country. This is evidenced by the DEATH of a young boy.  This DEATH was caused by CONTINUAL POLICIES OF GENOCIDE implemented by PAST AND PRESENT GOVERNMENTS of AUSTRALIA which endeavour to DISALLOW Aboriginal people to take their rightful place within Australia’s society as the DESCENDENTS OF THE ORIGINAL OWNERS OF THIS LAND.  We offer our heartfelt condolences to the Hickey Family and to the communities that Thomas belonged to. May Biame be with you and give you strength. We offer our heartfelt condolences to every Aboriginal person in this land as we know that this is the reality of INSIDE BLACK AUSTRALIA for Aboriginal people.  We put John Howard, Bob Carr, and the rest of Australia’s so called leaders that have condemned the Aboriginal community of Redfern for THEIR HEART WRENCHING REACTION to Thomas’s DEATH on notice for NOT OFFERING CONDOLENCES to HIS MUM, FAMILY AND COMMUNITIES.

      Bec’s opinion on the death of T.J Hickey:  My opinion on the death of T.J Hickey is that the incident, rather than questioning the good treatment of aboriginals by the police, it questions the entire police force. Policemen are known as people who maintain and advertise peace in our society, I am aware that in other countries, police are often corrupt but I have always had a strange kind of faith in the police of Sydney 2004. The death of T.J Hickey has been an unpleasant awakening that the police may not only be the friendly fat men from the television shows from my childhood.   T.J Hickey apparently was riding his BMX bike at high speeds while he was being pursued by the police. The police claim that they were not chasing Hickey but the aboriginal community have a different story. Hickey had apparently been assaulted by the police before and ‘if your black and you see a police car you just run’, says Hickeys relative. So whether or not the police were pursuing Hickey, he was afraid of being assaulted again and rode his bike at dangerous speeds, resulting in his death.   Witnesses say that the policemen checked Hickeys pockets and called for more backup before calling for an ambulance. This is another bloodthirsty act that can’t be overlooked. If there is anything good to be found out of T.J Hickeys death it is that the public have had a glimpse of what may be the true police force. I hope that now any corruption can be eradicated and that the police can return to the anti-racist peacekeepers that the community needs.

      Rachel’s opinion:  After looking at all the information on the Internet and newspapers I have realised there is no hard evidence proving either side’s argument. Because of this I feel like I am ‘walking on egg shells’ when giving my opinion. My thoughts are also not yet completely concrete because it is hard for me to understand the ongoing pain the aboriginals feel when it comes to racism and the contributions they are able to make to Australia. I think that Thomas Hickeys death should just be thought of as an accident, instead of the police ‘killing’ him. Also I think one of the reasons the Aboriginals made such a big deal about his death, and the fact that the white police supposedly killed him was because they were stretched past breaking point, they were so sick of being treated the way they had been that they just let lose, and that was why the riots occurred after his death.  	I also think it is reasonable for Bob Carr to have his own opinion (when he said that the Aborigines couldn’t blame him), I also think that neither the aborigine's who say they saw the police chase T.J or the police are completely reliable. But if I chose someone to believe to be honest I would believe the police, this is because they were doing their job. Also as the Aboriginal community has said they dislike the police, and so I think if they had a chance to get them in trouble they would take the chance.											 Therefore I think rather than accusing a certain group of people and creating conflict they should instead try and forget, understand and aim to improve the relationship between the two groups.

      Ellen’s Opinion  My opinion is that I am not on either the Police or the Aboriginal community’s side. I say this because I don’t think there is enough information against either side of the case. From the information I have seen though I believe that both sides of the story are partly at fault.    Most of the aboriginal community have grown up to fear police, I think that this must be partly white policemen’s fault because no community grows to hate another for no reason in particular, as Thomas Hickey’s aunt said “If you’re black and you see a police car you just run”. White policemen may have in the past or still do now abuse or wrongly accuse aboriginals for crimes, which they did not commit. This may or may not be true because there is no substantial evidence to show that this is true other than the words of Thomas Hickey’s family and community and the police case. Thomas Hickey’s family does claim that Thomas was assaulted last December, after being committed for a crime he claims not to have committed.  However Thomas did have a record with an apprehended violence order (AVO) issued against him, he was wanted for assault charges and also small crimes such as shoplifting. Thomas’s dad however claims that “He wasn’t a career thief. He was only stealing for a feed.” I believe though, under no circumstances is there a reason to steal food. I believe this because there are organizations around Sydney, which are willing to help people in need. I think the reason that Thomas Hickey stole for food even though there were organizations is because the most aboriginal community believe that they should be able to look after themselves without white society’s help to show them that they are independent.   The aboriginals have posted demands that they wish for the government, and police to follow. I think these requests are fairly reasonable but many of them will cost taxpayers money and it would require co-operation by the police. I think that the government and police should follow through on some of these demands to prove the innocence of the police that they are claiming and also to settle the matter once and for all. These demands I think are worth taxpayer’s money because if justice is needed than it will be served, it will provide everyone on how the aboriginals are treated and if there may be any other enquires into different cases needed. You need ask yourself why aren’t the police accepting the demands? (See blog called LIST OF DEMANDS……….)  There are two convincing sides to the T.J Hickey debate with both of them with evidence against the other. I have yet to make my own opinion to whose right and which side is wrong but I am sure that the police and T.J Hickey were both responsible to some degree for the accident.
