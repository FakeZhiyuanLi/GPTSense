      People change .. yeah true .. but when they change over the course of a relationship??? Im lost !! Why does the "change" put the other person in the relationship in such an awful state of hurt and fury ?? Isnt the change supposed 2b healthy for both ?? Is it fair or does it have to be this way ...  OR is it just another synonym - to term hypocrisy n double standards , as "change of thoughts, thinking, attitude, behaviour and perceptions."

      Dear Blog :))  After all the crap tht has bn going on around me, n still continues to .. inside my head, im beginning to feel n realise a sudden change within myself - a different person - who despite of all the confusions, question marks, uncertainty (which i guess r eternal n will dwell around me forever) n repeatedly the same nonsense over n over again .. is surprisingly finding it not so difficult to let go, n not so impossible to find peace within herself ..  Is it age, the fact tht im so far away from my homeland, my circumstances, have i lost all the support, hope or gven up or is it just as simple as tht ive tried with all tht i have n all tht i am .. and afcourse .. how cud i forget the "acceptance" factor ...  But yeah also im thinking .. when they say "happening for the best or for a reason" wht does tht exactly mean .. bc then to me its nothing more than being unbelievably painful ..   Hey i have to incorporate my inspirational black folder n my HTML/Flash lessons into my daily routine .. as for Quran n workouts its going pretty well ...

      Tum ho gham ko chupaye .. Mein hun sar ko jhukaye .. tum bhi chup ho, mein bhi chup hoon koun kise samjhaye .. ab dooryaan itni hain toh .. milna yahan kal hona ho ...  Sach hai k dil toh dukha hai Hum ne magar socha hai .. Dil ko hai gham kioun.. Ankh hai nam kioun .. Hona hi tha jo hua hai .. Us baat ko jaane hi do .. Jis ka nishaan kal hona ho ...

      1. Do something genuinely new.  2. Reclaim life's meaning.  3. Put yourself in the fun zone.  4. Bid farewell to guilt and regret. Everyone's past is filled with regrets, mistakes, and missed opportunities that still cause pain. These feelings are an index of our humanity, evidence that we have a heart and a conscience. But from an emotional energy point of view, they are deadweights that keep us from moving forward. While they can't merely be willed away, I do recommend you give yourself a good talking-to. Remind yourself that everyone has negative experiences. But whatever happened is in the past, and nothing can change that. Holding on to the memory only allows the damage to continue into the present.    5. Flywheel .. keep it spinning(an interest they connect with, no matter how eccentric)  6. Make up your mind.  7. Give to get.  ---- LHJ.com  http://www.lhj.com/lhj/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/lhj/story/data/7SecretsofHighEnergyPeople_04122004.xml

      Finally i get my passport .. after 3 months .. so im relieved .. slow day but as usual im practicing to take it calm .. todays daily coach said about appreciation n being kind .. its funny but i didnt find much to it .. bc its sumthing i do way too much .. :)) took this test called "how positive r u" n here is wht it said ...  You have your ups-and-downs You are generally positive about your life, but could do even better. Your medium score shows that in some areas of your life, you're not using all the strategies and skills that positive thinking has to offer. As a result, you're not only less happy than you could be, you're probably not as healthy, successful or effective. So what can you do? You need to pinpoint the areas of your life you feel most negative about - and then gradually build up your strength in those areas.  In particular, look at your self-esteem. With high self-esteem you can cope with any difficulties that arise. So be kind to yourself; moment to moment, during the day, point out what you are doing right. Treat yourself like a friend and congratulate yourself on any successes.  Final point: because you're slightly prone to low positivity, a crisis or setback may plunge you into negativity. If a crisis strikes, don't hesitate to get extra support from friends, family or a counsellor. Read Top ten tips for a positive life to develop useful positive strategies.

      Go for a walk ....  Every day, do something that reaffirms the beauty and joy of living.   Start and end the day on a positive note.  Don't allow anger and rage to rule your life.  Laugh ...  Don't be too hard on yourself.   Exercise.   Lean on others.   Meditate.   Simplify your life.   Talk it over.
