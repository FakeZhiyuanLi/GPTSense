      21/07/2004…today is my interview day with the college principal…. I was very much scared at the beginning but it all just went fine…………. The undergraduate program of the college will commence on 28/07/2004. I have never ever experienced a college life because I did not study the 11th and 12th classes in a college like my father did. I wait for the big day like all new comers to the college with a lot of fear in my mind………..

      From today onwards I am going to write down all what is going to happen to my life from this instant…before that I would like you to tell you about some other things too.. I passed out from 10th standard from infant Jesus Anglo Indian higher secondary school with 67.5% and I joined there itself for my +2 and I graduated from there with 73.25% in my ISC Examination……… Initially I decided to join in Christ College, Banglore but then due to my low mark I was refused admission but then it would have been possible for me to get into that college if I entered into a twinning program…but that too due to lack of my luck or because of some other matters I decided not to join there………….Thinking that I could easily get into some colleges in my home town itself I completely threw away “my study home away plan” but here too I was struck with bad luck. I submitted my applications to two of the main colleges in Kollam Fathima National college and Sree Narayana college………. I was not at all in the merit list of Fathima college (might be because we did not have Business studies as some of my friends said or because of my bad luck) but I made it in the list of the SN college I was ranked the 127th…oh god after all of that high standard English with Good accent, Un comparable standard in accounts when compared with state syllabus and the learning of Management theories in commerce which are taught in undergraduate level or even in the post graduate level and excellent know how in economic working of the country …………all what I get is 127th rank……….

      Hi my name is Rohith. I was born on 16th December in 1986 to an aristocratic Nair family, which was there from the late 18’s. The name of my family is “Thoppil”. We were famous in our place but now due to the death of my great grant father all were split. Now there is no Thoppil family but to retain the name of the old memory many of the inmates has named their house Thoppil. My great aunt used to say that you should be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proud to be borne into a family like this. During the British reign in India, once a diwan (who has a power of a Minister) from the royal court of Travancore came to our family on his visit. This is the story of my family….Now lets come to my house. I live in the south of India in the famous GOD ON COUNTRY “Kerala”. I live with my father mother and a sister. I had my pre schooling in Infant Jesus Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School…one of the leading schools in my town. It is said to have been found by British people during their reign in India. I finished my 10th standard ICSE from Infant Jesus with 67.5% mark and I also finished my 12th ISC with 73.25% mark. Now I am waiting for my admission to the college I have taken commerce as the main subject at my high school so I wish to take an undergraduate degree in commerce

      There was a strike today too, and we the first year students were asked to take part in it. At first they told us that the march was organized within the College campus but then when it reached the main gate, they changed their plans and they took us to a long walk in the hot sun blocking a part of the national highway escorted by armed police in vans and jeeps…………it was un tolerable ………….but it was an experience

      Today was one of the unforgettable days in my life “MY FIRST PROTEST MARCH AGAINST THE POLICE” never in my life had I took part in an anti police march or anything. I and my fellow first years at the college were forced to attend the march, first we went around the college shouting slogans and after that we proceeded towards the road. We tried to get out many times but then they didn’t leave us we were surrounded. And I could hear some of my seniors saying to each other not to loose a good opportunity to throw stones at the police. I was very much terrified in hearing this, I gradually decreased my pace, and I came last so that I could run back into the college in case of an attack…the march was due to a suicide of a student caused due to negligence of the government…………….Any how the march was not a success from the part of the organizers as to me it was a close shave…………..when the march reached near the armed police van it started raining…………………. If it had not been raining at that time I wouldn’t have been here now to write this story……………………………….

      I feel very much bad to go to the college more because of the awkward behavior of my seniors. Some of them are so rough that I could not cope up with them, and some even asked me to give them money… I told them that I don’t have any but then they are not leaving me alone. They told me that I should bring them some money on Monday. I am scared to go on to the College on  Monday.................

      Today was not at all a lucky day for me. We were late for the college today. And I had a short ragging by the seniors. I was very lucky to get out of it without a scratch and after the college was dispersed at 1. Pm I was stopped by some of my seniors and was forced to give them money. And they even told me to give some money again on Friday………….Ohhhhhhh god I think I will take a leave on Friday!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Today I went to the college at about 9.30AM with one of my friend in my car. The fear of getting caught by the seniors for ragging was in me…but then due to my luck or some other reasons there was no one near the gates of the college. We went inside and found out our classroom, there was a big rush near the classroom…Parents of the students who are going to join there were waiting anxiously. Soon we got into class and a substitute teacher came in for taking the attendance…when the attendance was nearly over a group of SFI some sort of group or party formed by the students of India came shouting to the class. Everyone including the teachers was a bit shock to see this…but then they just went along with their stuffs and we went along with ours…the class was over within an hour. When we came out of the college, both sides of the national highway roads in front of the college was filled with armed police men’s and armored vans and there were large pieces of stone lying here and there too on the road… some fight with students might have taken place…………seeing that it was not any more safe to stay there we fled from the site…………………….																							The daily classes will be held from tomorrow onwards!!!!!
