      so its tuesday. hoo-rah.  i had a freaking long blog written last night, and when i submitted it, my internet all froze up. boo on crappy computers.  quite a bit happened this weekend. stinedurf's parents got in a bike wreck. that sucks. i went and saw maria. she's crunk.  last night me and some other people watched miracle. all i can say is, that is an awesome movie. and that's all i'm going to say.  me, andrew, dooley, david, and possible michael are all going hardcore mountain biking tomorrow. it should be fun, watching everyone try to keep up with me.   in other news, miss courtney croslin owes me some burger street.   i hear parentals walking in, that means dinner is here. i might blog later.

      whats the deezy?  its about 1:15 AM, the time on my blogs is gay and all wrong. today was fun. i got up this morning and helped my mom move some stuff at her school. it sucked, but its money so i can't complain.  i came back home, and there was a message on the answering machine from harley davidson dallas. i had applied for a job there a couple weeks ago, assuming they would just trash my application. turns out, they are interested in me working there. i had an interview with "tom" and he thinks i'm good for the job. he's going to talk to his general manager and let me know if i get it. rock.  after that, i mosy'd on out to chris' house. him, blake, and chase were all out in the field. chris was working on a mini track, and chase and blake are making a good size jump for our big bikes. i chose to work with chris, but i didn't do too much. i pretty much watched him work. we got a NICE berm built, this thing is going to be awesome. jessica, krystle, and jess' brother zack showed up at about 7:30. zack stayed with us while jessica and krystle went and ate. he's crunk.  it got to dark to work on the mini track, so we wound up at chris' house. all the guys showered off, then we went to jessica's for some parent-less fun. kyle, croslin, and maggie all showed up. chris and i went hardcore on this pool game thing we made up. it's an amazing game. everybody except me, chris, croslin, and kyle sat out in the hot tub. chris and i played pool the whole time. what losers we are.   so i leave at about 12:40, and on my way home, corey edwards calls me out of the blue. turns out he is trashed at firewheel, and has to stay up at work until 9AM. not sure why, but he's been on the clock for 21 straight hours. crazy kid.  well its gettin late, and i gotta get up early to go mini with chris, blake and chase. tomorrow is going to be a   badical   day of dirt biking. props to kyle on that one.  and maybe i'll get rid of my horrendous farmers tan. just maybe.

      hello lovers.  today was my first day of summer, and it rocked. i got out of school at 1:30, thanks to my mom. i basically called her while i was at lunch, and asked her if she would call naaman and tell them i have a doctors appointment or something. then i told her that regardless if she calls or not, my right hand man lindsey already forged a note with my moms name on it. needless to say, mom pulled through for me.  so i leave school at 1:40ish, and i go to croslin's house. kyle's there, so we all sit around and talk until he leaves for work. then me and courtney read her notes from like 8th and 9th grade, and think about how we're  done with high school.  we go to wendy's got some food, and we saw kelly record's dad on his bike on our way home. we waved to eachother, then he took off. croslin and i then went back to her house, ate, and watched some soap opera. my goldfish attention span kicked in, and i couldn't focus. maybe next time.  i leave croslin's at around 4:30, and go pick up ashley ottmer to head out to kilgore to watch some baseball. her doctor thing ran late, and she got stuck in traffic, so we didn't get on the road until about 5:30, but its all good. good 2 hour drive, to watch 45 minutes of baseball. we lost, but it was fun. she's super cool. on the way home, colin starts to feel like crap, but rolls down the windows, throws on some red hot chili peppers, and kicks it. then he feels better. hoo-rah.  after dropping off ashley, i head home, and nail a racoon. poor little guy, he got blood and stuff all over the underside of my truck. sucks to be him.  all in all, it was an awesome start for summer.

      hi colin's blog readers.  today sucked, because it is school. i argued with ms campbell, my retarded clinical teacher. i really want to kick her off my planet. i suppose i shall wait until the right time.  i won 2 more ribbons in my engineering class. i'm so going to be a millionaire one day.  we watched 'osmosis jones' in anatomy. bill murray is in it, and i must say it wasn't very good. it could have been a lot better. i also presented my midget project. haha. little people.  i have to write a poem for tomorrow, and read it to the class. i'm gonna hold off on that until 3rd period, or maybe even while i'm waiting for my turn to present. then, me and zack are gonna give our rendition of "last summer" by the lostprophets. it shall definately be a site to see.  2 MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!

      whew yeah, 3 more days of school left. today was the last monday of high school for me. i'm ready to get out and enjoy summer.  school today was boring, but i found an amazingly hot picture of mandy moore. if you see me at school, check out my binder, you'll find her in it. i got my exemptions today, which is a relief, seeing how i got gay RAC from mrs campbell. today was a big lazy day at school.  work wasn't too bad, jessi face came and saw me. she's still lookin good i must say. daryl dee dropped by, and later jon jon, wes, robert, and jodee all came in. fun stuff.  right now i'm printing out my poetry anthology for Croslin to turn in as if it is hers. i mean, i know i do good work and all, but i want to start charging for this stuff. i could make a few bucks.  i go to the doctor tomorrow to find out if i need surgery or not on my nose. it's still a tad crooked, but i'll see what the old man says. afterwards, i'm going to discount tire to see if i can get me a job. i need a new one.  there is a baseball game thursday night in kilgore. will someone please explain to me why we are playing just south of BFE? honestly. but, it won't be that bad, i think me and ottmer are gonna take the long haul down there. should be fun. totally.  story of my life. yahoo.

      so its sunday night, and i'm sitting here blogging. totally rad.  this is the last week of high school for me. i'm really pumped about it. 13 years of school, and now i'm done. i'm gonna miss a lot of people next year. and then there's some people that i'm glad i'm not gonna see again.   i watched like 4 hours of Trucks! today on spike tv. man that show is awesome.  tonight was fun, i went and played some sand volleyball with andrew, dooley, hess, heather, david, amber, and mike hammons. yeah.   Deal of the night:   so i totally found the best place to get a big ol' fountain drink for cheap. exxon. i got a 64 ounce dr pepper for 1.29. now if that isn't unbeatable, i don't know what is.  my blog's are so pointless, yet so fun. i love being me.

      whew what a saturday.  today i drove to my cousins house in grapevine, got completely and utterly lost. i'm talking, i ended up on harry hines in downtown dallas. i'm still trying to figure out how that happened. i finally made it out there, and sold his friend the tv and stuff out of my truck. that was a quick and easy 200 bucks.  i get home, take a nice nap, and then get online. chris tells me about the rsvp show tonight, so i decided to go. i get there, and we sit in the back and ramble the whole time. saw quite a few people i haven't seen in a while. after the krystle wants to go hang out at jessica's in the hot tub. me and chris decided thats a negative, i base my reasons on that i don't want to watch people flirt and a hot tub sausage party is not my dig. so me and chris went bowling. we did horrible, but it was fun.   you know those shots when the pin comes out into the lane? me and chris did that 11 times. thats just hardcore. we left there, drove around in the mustang, and ate burgers. now i'm sitting here typing it all out.  whew what a day. i'm going to bed.

      man today was boring. i sat in clinical for 3 hours, and listened to some guy talk about how he is an OB/Gyn doctor. now what led him into that field is beyond me. he is either totally gay, or really desperate. now thats just gross.  he also showed a slideshow thing about STD's and had pictures. quite possibly the grossest thing i've seen in a long time. total ack.   i realized how much egotistical/cocky/a show off i am today 4th period. there is a car show this saturday at sachse high school, and i want to take my truck to it. BUT, i told my cousin's friend i would sell him the TV and tuner out of my truck tomorrow. now is the hard part that is funny to me. should i (a) sell the tv and tuner for a good amount of money, or (b) take my truck to the auto show and show off my system, tv, and all that good stuff.   i hate decisions like this. MONEY OR SHOWING OFF. i can't decide.  i have work at 5, and a fun filled night tonight. i might blog later.    Current Listening:  Lil Flip - Game Over

      Hi readers.  today was a boring thursday, with class being gay as usual. until i hit 3rd period. me, phyllip, and blake all left to go get some wendy's, and when we got back, mrs heslink's husband had his top fuel dragster out in the parking lot. weird? i think so. so i scarf down my burger, and we all head over to check this thing out. dang that thing is bad.   1800 horsepower and weighs like 2000 pounds. a 496 cubic inch hemi. and i got to sit in it. oh man. ok enough car talk.  i went to the baseball game tonight. it got to like the 3rd inning, but then the rains came, and it got postponed or something, i wasn't paying attention.  i'm pumped for the weekend, not sure what i'm doing, but guaranteed it's gonna be fun. possibly some extreme bowling friday night? we shall see. indeed, we shall see.  but for now, i have to finish my project on dwarfism for anatomy. should i feel bad that i am laughing at all the pictures i'm finding? haha. little people.

      Hi blog readers.  its wednesday, and it's been a while since i've updated. it's not like i don't have the time, i'm just to stinkin lazy.  so i basically got fired/quit my job. the head boss of my store got fired, as did the manager above me. i was told that if i didn't have incredible sales for the next week, i'd be gone, so i just quit. stupid wilsons leather.  i turned in an application to cycle gear, and the manager there knew me from when i worked at tom thumb. i'd always talk to him about bikes, cause he always bought bike magazines. maybe he'll hook me up.  tonight i hung out with chris, jennifer and sarah from UNT. we watched that 'stuck on you' movie. i thought it sucked. it was lame and boring. but i had pizza. DON'T EVER BUY HOT WINGS FROM PIZZA HUT. they suck! they're not wings. they're like fried. i'm hacked off.  me and lyn-z are so crunk we're punk. don't mess with us.

      friday. finally.  i finally was able to get out of bed and go do something today. i'm saving the rest of my happy pills for a big bad rainy day. or maybe just for a date that needs some fun added to it.  i went by 4wheelparts and got the first part of the lift for the back of my truck. stupid UPS messing up the shipping, i'm still waiting for some parts. went and got my paycheck, then got kelly and ate at rolly polly sandwich place. that place would be freaking good, if it wasn't so expensive.  went to aaa muffler and got hooked up on some new exhaust. my truck isn't as loud now, it has a  mellow  tone to it. like the italics? exactly.  went over to chris' and played on the mini, and thought up an idea for wheelie shoes. i'm gonna start working on those next week. we played there for a while, then went over to krystles. maggie and donnie came over, lindsey got off work, and blake showed up, and we all went to see shrek 2. that movie is great. got out of the movie, and realized i get to take everybody back to krystle's house. but i love them, so i obliged.  rocked out on the way home, thanks to lostprophets and blindside. now it is time to sleep.

      howdy folks, i know its been a long time since i've updated, but quite a bit has gone on.  this past weekend was really fun. i went down to jessica's lake house and went fishing and hardcore tubing. i tried to learn how to wakeboard, but i'm still not good at it. i saw a 50 pound catfish while i was there. that thing is freaking huge.  tuesday i had surgery on my nose. good crap it hurts. the bleeding has almost completely stopped, but its still pretty dang big. now i know what it feels like to be a jew. since i've been out of it, and not able to go anywhere, i've been playing MX Unleashed like every freaking day. dang this game is incredible.  i can feel my codone kicking back in, and that means its time to go back to bed.
