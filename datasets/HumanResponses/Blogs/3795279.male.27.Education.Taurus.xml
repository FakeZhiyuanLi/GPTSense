      Well here it is June 30 and I'm sitting at work surfing the net trying to get things situated as I set out on my journey. I have spent the last month selling, buying and donating things so that I can be well prepared for my journey abroad. I have been checking my mail box day in and day out looking for my arrete de nom from the academie of CRÃ‰TEIL so that I can hurry down to the Embassy to get my visa and all that jazz, but I wait patiently because each day my mail box is empty. I'm apparently very bored at work because I have time to create this blog, but it's nice to spend your last months doing things that you enjoy besides working. For now, I'll go and try to be productive at work and I'll be back soon!  Sam

      Hey Guys,  It's been a few days since I posted anything, but I have been consumed with French classes, packing, selling items, donating items and making plans to go home to see family before I leave. Yeah, I know it sounds like I'm an over-achiever, but I'm leaving in August and I have to be out of my current apartment by the end of the month. I'm still waiting for that damn academie to send me something so that I know they are trying to get things situated and such, but I wait in vain because my mailbox is empty every evening when I get home from a long day of work. I'm here at work now sitting, bored and sleepy hoping to get home to find my arrete so I can take off from work, drive to Houston and get my visa. Well that's as good as it gets for now, but I'd love to hear from some of you other people hanging around here and there. feel free to drop me a line or two or a nice, enchanted email. Catch you soon.  Sam

      I've been patient about the whole idea of waiting for paperwork, waiting for the schools to mail a piece of paper, but now I am ready to get this over and done with. I have packed up most of my things and I have tried to make arrangements to get things settled and I'm being held up by this piece of paper that says "you'll be here" I knew for sure that I'd have the arrete by now, but it seems that I've been merely living in a dream. Oh well for now i guess I'll just continue going day by day, waiting patiently..
