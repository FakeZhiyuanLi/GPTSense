      Pretty Girl (The Way) was a song I discovered a year or two ago, its quite good, at least worth listening to.&nbsp; A nice love song, but little edgy. &nbsp; Yeah, well I was reminded of this when I heard their new song Memory on the launch cast radio. &nbsp; Memory bringing back memories. &nbsp; Sorry for posting allllll the songs I find that I like.&nbsp; But I think it is worth it, we can realize each others tastes and such.

      Almost over by Limp Bizkit, not my favorite band but the verses are cool. &nbsp; Blue eyes look you over, with a turquoise rim they stare, accusing, a darkness oozes out and over, surrounding you over your head the chill of the glare as icicles form in your mind you are lower than an ant and those never blinking eyes will never leave.  &nbsp;  Peacock Feathers

      I just got ahold of Dookie, which is an old school Green Day Albumn.  I say if we become anything, we shoudl do a cover albumn, and beat the shit out of Jessica Simpson for butchering Angel, which was a beautiful song, before she killed it trying to use her voice in a way she does not have enough power for.  Sorry you aren't Christina.   can you tell it bothers me?  "Save us from the wicked, shield our souls..."

      Float on is some trippy shit, oh my spinning sheep.  No Sapphire lets not think about what they are doing to the sheep.  And in the silence of the night one might find peace and satisfaction where all other elements have gone to ground the intensity of the silence overpowers simple creatures, simple thoughts and simple dreams Particles of dark emerge, contrasting and confusing the senses, spice in the wind brought to the tiger

      My genius plan:  1. Name change (It will still be the bleached chameleons but with a twist)   N(g).I(mrie).B(abbit). = NIB or it could be BIN or NIB or BNI (but who cares really.), but i intend to make it so it would be like Naughty Ignorant Bitches. or something. you get what i mean. I can't think of anything right now.   Nagbim (NG, IM and BA shuffled) or we could reshuffle it. anything as long as its readable. Hilary you could do the work here you english genius you. anyway.   So it would either be NIB, BIN, NIB, BNI or Nagbim or whatever and after that we'll put aka Le Blanchi Caméléons. (hey, shut up its cool.)   reason why we will use french: parce que, nous reuni dans Canada et apprenez Francais even though we don't really want to. (BEcause we met in canada and learn french even though we dont really want to) which doesnt make much sense really, but still, french is cool.    New name:  NIB aka Le Blanchi Caméléons   or we could just be known as L.B.C though it kind of sounds like a news channel but thats okay i guess. so yes, OPINIONS PLEASE!! i just think The Bleached Chameleons sounds a little bland.  note to self: le nom does not matter. (but i just wanted to speak my mind :()  2. 2004-2005 year plan    at least 5 self composed songs (with all parts written out of course)  hopefully all well rehearsed  5 cover songs well rehearsed (we will each pick one, and the other two will jointly agree on)   record a demo before the summer starts (5 cover songs, 5 original)  coffeehouse!! (its time for the school to suffer, no just joking)   and if possible maybe more original songs (dont worry, ill be doing most of the work for writing. colleen, youll have to write your own parts though, i dont know drums too well.)   note: may seem a little far fetched, but its possible as long as we practice hard and ya know, we should actually start doing something? it doesnt have to be fantastic but it will be intersting. we can sell each demo for like 10 bucks or something. or if we are really that bad, maybe 5. I have lots of ideas pour le album. he he he..   3. Long term plan  Lets just wait till we settle next year yea? hehe though it would be cool to like go platinum or something.   Sorry, I'm kind of dreaming here.   okay, COMMENTS PLEASE, PEOPLE!! (we shall have to add colleen to this soon)

      Rocking to the sounds of The Killers.  I just want to blare it and jump up and down and scream the lyrics.  we could change the lyrics...  Well somebody told me that you had a girlfriend that looked like a boyfriend that I had in february of last year...  yeah, happy day.   -------------- Now to the Purpose of this Post ----------------  My H. (my Bass Teacher) has been teaching me how to make bass lines in a very strange way.  I still do not get how you figure out all the notes in certain chords, but I am guessing you can help me a bit with that.  Then I just use the notes in the chord my own little groovy way.  Because Bassists are very groovy you know.  So assignment for the time being.  Get the Groove.  And practice songs other than previously assigned by Mr. H.  Speaking of which, songs I want to play.  *shrugs*  I just want to get the groove you know

      just had a curry puff. tis' yummy. i might have another one later. mmm. got woken up by 4 phone calls from the same aunt. something is truly wrong with her. i'm sorry, i shouldnt be saying these things.  oh and i've just started to read the da vinci code. its bloody frightening, i couldn't sleep at all last night. okay it's not that scary, but if you think about it, it is. hmm. okay, maybe i'm just plain weird. is there a movie on it yet? i certainly hope not. i want to make a movie on it heh heh heh. oh yah, an update on my photography-film status, i saw this really old picture with my mom and a bunch of her mates in it and it was taken kind of weirdly so i told her, "bad photography". and she said "i think you took the picture" and i just said "oh"  well thanks, really. you just ruined whatever mental edge i had. but ya know what, that was 10 years ago. i think. ooo boy. i'm really starting to miss school. ahhh swimming in about 4 hours. god save me. there's nothing wrong with swimming, really, i just dont want to go swimming right now.  oh yeh did anyone watch the latest episode of amazing race where they're eating the caviar? okay well, theres this really funny part when Colin was asking Christie to put some juice in the caviar to make it easier to eat and she was like no and colin was like why not? and here goes... hahahhahahha funny. Christie goes "Coz... JUST LEAVE ME ALONE" okay its not so funny here but on tv, she just kind of went devil-like on the "just leave me alone" her voice was all croaky and everything. "just leave me alone." ahahhahahahhahahhahahhaha. the cousins are the funniest though, honestly. the dwarf lady just cracks me up when she waddles up the stairs.  jessica simpson's rendition of angels is extremely pathetic.  waddle waddle HAHHAHAHAHHA

      weirdest thing happened today. Justin came over today to watch a movie. okay no one knows justin. he's this kid from across the street, goes to school in orlando. who the fuck goes there anyway. what kind of schools do they have there? well anyway, he came over right, then   he said "oh i havent had any breakfast yet, have you?"  and i said "umm no not quite" (i really didnt though, i swear)   so we went to get breakfast, and we had to cross the street. there were tons of cars. scary, i tell you. I almost turned back. but then again we were just too lazy to walk down to the stupid traffic light. the governement is so stupid. they just  have  to put the damn thing all the way at the bottom. what the fuck is the point? we would have to walk all the way down, cross the street, and walk back up to the damn eatery. so anyway yes. He randomly grabbed my hand and dragged me through the cars. well not really but the point is that he grabbed my hand. and held it. as if we were  going out.  what happened after that, i will just leave unsaid. hes hot, but just not my type. i dont believe in summer flings. and he goes to school in fucking orlando. who does that?   (i really hope he doesnt know about this diary.)   anyway bigger news, i think i might have met the guy of my dreams.... not. but i saw&nbsp;this sex god on the bus home and he sure made my day even though all he did was smile at me but still.  sex god.. &nbsp; okay. so yes.   i am being forced to go swimming with my aunt tomorrow.  swimming . of all things to do. She asked me today when i was at grandpa's. and i just kind of ignored her but it didnt work. i still have to go. ahhhh and i was thinking of sleeping in.   on a happier note, a sex god smiled at me today.   &nbsp;  just got news that a paris hilton look-alike is going to be going to my school. bloody hell.  but hey, a sex god smiled at me, you can't beat that.

Considering asian blood runs through  all  of my viens, this ain't good. Canada.. what have you done to me!!!! but then again, asians&nbsp; do  cook the fake-chinese food. so I guess I'm good. their rice sucks though.&nbsp;   I wonder if the chinese food in the States tastes like the ones in Canada hmmm...   okay breakfast time. all this food talk is making me  hungry

      okay, you know when you wake up one day and just feel like shit. well i'm having one of those days. nothing feels right. I keep telling myself that I'm fat and ugly and need to lose weight. this sucks. i skipped my uncle's wedding (not that i really knew him anyway) but yes i feel bad. I dont even know if he's my uncle. He might be my cousin. I have no clue.   I planned to do so much in the summer when I was still in school, but am I doing any of it? Noo... nothing. I haven't even gone for a skate yet. That's bad. OH yah, does anyone want to sponsor my stupid attempt of being a photographer, meaning buy me a camera. maybe i should go rob a bank. just like Dr Ock in Spiderman. okay no. thats just stupid. I'm going to have to rent The Recruit, The sum of all fears and possibly Coyote Ugly. yup, im going through a Bridget Moynahan phase. its funny. Im incredibly weird. She's a pretty good actress though I must say. and she did play soccer. and ya know, anyone who plays or played soccer is a friend to me. I'm even thinking of buying a signed picutre of her and Will Smith on ebay. speaking of Will Smith,  HE IS FINE . did  ANYONE  see that body in the movie. oh my. it is  hotttt .   okay sorry. hmmmmmmmmm.. i think im hungry but im not sure. hilary where the hell are you?? you havent updated in like 4 days and im not seeing you online either. okay well i might go eat now (yes, get even fatter) hooo boy.

"AAAHHHCHOO, I'm sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit" heh. ok sorry that was lame. hmm. yes. my cousins are cleaning the pond we have here and they seem to be destroying it. oh well that is fine. never liked the fish anyway. i have to start doing work. i am such a slacker its funny. well not really. ha ha ha. okay, so. right. lalalalelelelololoo ok i am going to actually do some work now, hopefully..

      i probably just had one of the most emotional times of my life. well, not really. but it was somewhat epiphay-ic. i was just thinking about how much life would be better if dad had not died. i hardly knew him. calling someone "father" or "dad" was a thing i never did. i dont know if life would be better for me (he would have never let me go to rcs) but it definetly would have been better for my grandfather and family. i love my grandpa more than ever now. and i dont know. i feel bad for having to leave every september just leaving him here. and same with my mom. and then i just have a whole bunch of people here really missing me. and its not like a "I miss you" kind of thing but more like "I miss you-want you here right now" kind of thing. okay, that doesnt really make sense but i just hate not being able to be here for my family. especially my grandpa. none of my fucking cousins respect him. well i guess they do in a way but its not like a "i love you" kind of thing, its just a "i love you because my mom/dad tells me i should". floyd is fine, and maybe a few of the older ones, but i dont know, it just seems as if they dont really care about him (grandpa, not floyd). All grandpa's life now is his kids and grandkids. thats it. he has no fucking life. and he doesnt deserve not having one. but i guess in some way thats just what happens when you're old, but see if my dad was here, oh boy, would he ever be good to him. i can tell you that my grandpa would be a much happier man. i want him to be happy. and now its like i should take up the obligation of having to take care of my grandpa, and "take over" my dad's "job", but i fucking cant, cos im in canada more than half the time. you know how we have to make sacrificies just like in spiderman? well maybe this is a sacrifice i have to make. you know, he doesnt have much time left in this world.. and in a way im willing to give up my dreams for the 5 or 6 years he has left. i dont really know how long he has left, but thats probably it considering he's been living on one lung for like 10 years.   and then theres my mom, she misses me like hell too when im gone. its never been a huge thing to me that i should make everyone happy instead of myself, but you know, an epiphany. i think most people know im just gonna say all this and not do anything about it, and i do agree in some ways. im a huge ass coward. i hate big changes. they just arent cool. but i want to be here when he leaves.. i just wish i knew how to speak whatever he speaks so i could tell him how much i love him. i hope he knows though.   fuck this sucks. okay as you may have guessed, i cried a river writing this. shower time. later people.

      I really am though. Im thinking maybe photography will be cool. honestly though. I think im going to go read up about it, and start taking pictures on my own. like, why not? hilary, wanna be my model? heh.. no, really though, hey anyone, if u want me to take pictures of you, here's your lady. right here. ill do it. just not any nude ones. my virgin eyes....   oh my, am i ever smart. what the hell is wrong with me anyway. i seem to be leaning onto the arts side of life. which isnt wrong but it wasnt exactly my intention in life. i still want to be a psychologist. god this is annoying. do photographers earn a lot? maybe I'll get like a really nice camera, live in LA, and be some psyhotic orlando bloom fan, follow him around, taking pictures, and then selling them. like why not? sounds fun. get to earn some money. fuck im weird. and now im looking for places to get my eyebrows waxed. you know ive always wanted to be in front of the camera and stuff. well i guess thats what everyone wants but im thinking maybe im better behind the camera..  okay, im definetly weird. im going to go get some milk now. goodbye.

      okay my social life here is completely zip. i've got a couple of friends and thats it. actually ive got plenty of friends but im either not comfortable with them anymore or they're just way too busy with fucking school. AHHHH which is fine i suppose. more time to be with myself. joy.   going to see a musical today. thats gonna be fun. this week is gonna be so boring i dont even wanna think about it. well i guess im just gonna have to drown myself in diabetic recipes. oh did i not mention my summer job? well its not really a job, im not exactly getting paid, which is really the whole point in a job but anyway, i have to make a recipe book for diabetic people.. well ok fine it is pretty cool in some ways, but, no. well its actually not that bad. maybe i should go skating. why didnt i think of that? god, sometimes i confuse myself. im really missing school, which is probably one of the saddest things ive said this whole year but i really do. going to get some ice cream, mmmmm... ice cream.  adios

      well i've decided to move back to blogger after seeing the change in templates. they are finally actually worth looking at. i actually like the one hilary uses but decided not to use it in fear of being killed. so yes if you would like to look at my previous blog, it is at http://lizardfuel.diaryland.com . trust me, diaryland isn't all that great, i just found a site where they gave out free templates, and that alone was tempting enough, but i'm going to beautify this account so i shall leave you now. goodbye.

      Slacking at my job. The tea lady (i think) just sprayed some weird air freshner thing and I am gagging like a chipmunk. hyuk hyuk hyuk. next year i am definetly not gonna pick an office job. and I defintely do not see myself working (10 years down the road) in some white... boring, old office with like cabinets full of weird folders. nnnnno. never. I see myself up on a stage with Hilary and Colleen by my side rocking to the sounds of Le Blachi Cameleons. HA HA HA. either that or running around killing rats. WACHA! speaking of the band, hilary go check our blog, unless you havent done so already. i have laid out a brilliant plan ahead of us. MWA HA HA HA HA HA.  anyway, plan for the day. finish up my work here, wait till mom calls, go out for lunch (with mom). AHH. I'm sure it will be a real bonding experience = I hope we go someplace nice. I am so very bored, and hungry. Okay I should probably get off this before I get murdered.

      I'm incredibly bored and I feel like singing a song. Why do people like to call themselves pimps? I dont get it. So I spent the last hour watching Wonderwoman. it is such a cheesy show. honestly. and its like 400 years old.  You know what I should really do? Nothing. My life is a mess here. well not really. Justin came over again. and lets just say something interesting happened. boys are truly weird. C'est tres stupide. Love is, that is.  I need to go for a skate. I really do.  Did I ever mention that DJ's are weird? Maybe I should be a Dj. i mean, i AM weird.
