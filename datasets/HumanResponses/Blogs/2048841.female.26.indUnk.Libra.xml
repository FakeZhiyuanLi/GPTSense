       Cannot Blog   Since my laptop is dead, I cannot have access to a computer as much as I used to have before. Even though we still have one at home, most of the time, my brother is using it. I will certainly continue this blogging as soon as I get my laptop back. but in the mean time, I don't want to be one of the statistics that someone starts a blog and ignores it after few days. because this is what is happening!!!! but it was all out of my control. and plus, I hate my brother's keyboard. I feel that everyone can hear me type in the house when I am using it.  it is morning, I took advantage of his sleep to blog a very very bit. and now I have to prepare some breakfast for the whole family. have a good day, whoever u may be...

       Today's reality kind of suck!   Well first of all, allow me to ventilate. I cannot even do it properly without re-writing the word 5 times.  I am on my brother's computer, since mine is dead. I took it today to Future shop. Apparently The mother board is dead. It might have burned or something like that. I got used to typing on my laptop. Now using this weird keyboard is awkward. I don't even know how to write awkward.. and many other words.  Today was my first day, with no computer in my room- and I was actually in my room. I cleaned it up, fixed everything, and often, I made a move, the same that I would do when I want to check if someone is online. But this time, it was a half-move. I couldn't go any further, there was nothing electronic on my desk. I am actually excited to see my adaptation to that situation. My brother thinks that I will not survive without a computer in my room. but I do not want a desktop , a loud and big thing, in my beautiful and sensitive room.  Even now, I am so tempted to download msn messenger. But I have resisted, so I may not be addicted as much as I thought. I hope that this will give me the chance to do something else in the morning than checking my emails and maybe I will not get to work sharp. In 4 weeks, I am supposed to get my laptop back. They say, if u do something for a month, (30 days) it will become a habit. So maybe interneting will not be a habit anymore....   Anyway, it is much cooler to blog from a laptop especially if u have an orange room and not a brown basement....

       Is it history repeating?   Yesterday I wanted to take a picture but did not look carefully on my way home to find something nice enough to take it into a picture.  Then I got home and had loads to do... I did not blog. I am trying to make this a habit. Same as I tried with exercising and meditation. It is just funny, how I bounce from one thing to another without even trying to accomplish one. It has been easily 7 years that I say to myself I have to meditate, at least few times a week. I know it will do me good. I have experienced it, it really relaxes me and makes me come back to where I really want to be, and what really matters. Same thing with exercising, I feel more energetic. What does Blogging give me? I dunno yet. I know I like to write and I want to try this. I want to take a nice picture everyday, or every other day. I want to open my eyes and see what surrounds me. I want to be a good observer. Anyhow, I am still backing up my laptop, and hopefully will get a brand new windows xp soon. I want to try to do it tonight. This way I can have fun with my laptop on Saturday.   I have to live in the present. I so never do it!!!!  :(

         Still learning     I just found out how to publish !! At least that is what I would like to think. But I still haven't found out how to change the links on the right side of the screen. Hey, it is cool to write ur thoughts, now how private can they be?

       Some things never change   Nothing will change. I will wake up, take my time, have fun browsing the net and suddenly realize how late I am! Today, for a change, I decided to create a Blog- but it is a private one, because I am not sure how I will feel having people read my thoughts. Since my English is not good enough for "publishing", and I don't think I have that much interesting things to say, to have a Blogger like Pranay or jackie's, it rather stay private (for everyone's sake). Sometimes it is interesting to read what they (P and J) have to say, but sometimes I just don't get it, because it is so personal I guess. Anyway, I am still typing and I should take a shower, brush my teeth, get dressed, prepare my lunch and leave in 30 minutes.   Today: Baby sitting - work - private classes ! ;-)

       Finally reunited!   After 2 months of absence, I finally got my laptop. The CPU is changed, and the CD-rom as well.  I have to relearn everything. I forgot how to Blog! There was this option to put it on my website, and I don't remember how to do that. I have so many ideas about what to write, but I still have to organize them, so it is understandable. I still don't know if I would want other people to read my blogs. Anyways, I don't see why it is an issue, since no one knows the site, and no one would actually care to read those nonsense thoughts. If at least I had information, or if it was entertaining.... Actually, I wanted to start writing stories for my students. So I thought of "blogging" them.  Anyways, it is 1:30 am and nature is just astonishing. I simply love it. We just got home and had to shovel the entrance and the garage. It wasn't cold, but it was snowing so much. The snow is perfect for a snow fight or for a snowman. If it continues to snow like that, and the roads will be super awful, we won't have school tomorrow :D yeah! , or if we do, I just hope the snow will be the same, so we can build a huge snowman. I will take pictures and post them. For the spirits. I feel so good about writing.

       DEODORANT-CANCER?    urlLink New York Post Online Edition: health   January 13, 2004 -- LONDON - Chemicals found in underarm deodorants have been detected in the tumors of breast-cancer sufferers, British scientists said yesterday.  Researchers at the University of Reading found traces of the chemicals, called parabens, in tissue samples, proving the preservatives can accumulate inside the body, although a direct link with breast cancer has not been proven.   "Their detection in human breast tumors is of concern, since parabens have been shown to mimic the action of the female hormone estrogen, and estrogen can drive the growth of human breast tumors," Dr. Philippa Darbre, lead author of the study, said. "It would, therefore, seem especially prudent to consider whether parabens should continue to be used in such a wide variety of cosmetics applied to the breast area."   The study was published in the Journal of Applied Toxicology.   Reuters

       Yes ! I did it! (part 2)   you're gonna ask me how? well simple. I registered at the YMCA , yes yes, I did! i am so happy!  I may end up fitting in  my favorite skirt. and by the time i fit in it, it will be so untrendy!  Anyways, damn it is 1 am and i gotta wake up at 6:30 tom.  I have so many things to do, so many parties to attend (i am so popular!) Olala... i am so stressed. end of the etape... shit man! how will i make it? I will make it.  I will.  and i will go to the GYM.  every tuesday... or some tuesdays, but every thursday and on week ends!  I am gonna make it , YES I AM GONNA MAKE IT.  freak, plus all those math tests i am behind... and the cahier extras.... and the feuilles de francais!!! how come i am so behind? what happened? what did i do? am i a good teacher? are my kids actually learning anything? ok, i am going to bed.

       Yes! I did it!   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your applause. I finally did it. I finally posted a picture. I finally posted this blog on my website and I finally blogged!  Yes , yes , it is almost a miracle. But the true miracle will be once I see that I did not abandon my blog.   well, as I said in my earlier blog today, 2004 is the bigboom! why? simple, i am doing things i wanted to do for a long time.I registered to a painting class. I will start by drawing, and then I will learn oil painting. I am not sure if I really like oil paint. I think I am more drawn to watercolors. But hey, i will give it a try anyway.  ( i am starting to feel sick, my brother was sick all afternoon and i have a feeling, it is because of the old muffin we ate... ) Anyways, my classes will start in 3 weeks. I am really excited to see what will come out of it.   I also registered in a soap-making class. I want to make soaps for mother's day. The teacher seems very nice and she said the course is devided in 5 classes. 1-Soap with glycerine. 2- Soap with a bunch of oils. ( not to do with kids ) 3-4-Soins personnels (rince bouche, dentifrice) 5-shampoing !!! doesn't seem cool ( i hope u understand french ) So that will keep my mondays busy. I am excited to learn these things. And it is much cheaper than Bella Pella!! YEAH! i am paying 65$ for the 5 classes. Bella Pella charges 45$ per class... And for the Painting class, it is 90$! in the west island, it is 290$! Am i saving or what? -- let's see the results first.   I called Arthur Murray to get info about the tango classes. but it is way too expensive for something that i am not even sure i will like.  Anyways, since i have 2 courses already, i think i will take it slow with the tango. I should not overload myself either. Should i go to Greece this summer?  i will post some neat pictures i took with my webcam.              Those were the artistic kind of pics.  now here is me, trying to have new looks with that towell... that u may get a chance to see later on.

       Am I finally able to post pictures?   Well, 2004 is starting with a big boum! I decided to take action, that whatever I do is sustainable and mostly, that i enjoy it.  I just transferred my blog to tripod, this way, my website is full, though i still haven't decided to get it linked with the other pages.  Now i am trying to see if i can transfer pictures. I stopped wondering and checked the help section on Blogger. very well explained i must say. Much better than the little window that we get on the right  when we publish.  Well, there is lots to say once the ideas flow... hopefully i will come to experience that soon, but for now i will simply try to upload some pictures.

      How can someone come up with a nick like that for me? Thanks Marvy.   I am in a low-blog period right now. I don't feel like blogging and I just want to sleep. In fact, I am in a low everything period. Maybe because of the word period actually...   Last week end we went to the state of NY for camping. At 11 pm, we realised that we had the wrong poles for the tent. I think it was Christina's poles. Anyways... at 11 pm, we ended up driving in the middle of nowhere. Anyways, we found a little cute hotel, not expensive, with a microwave and a fridge!!! yeah!   i don't have time to finish this blog!!! later -

         The world is full of different people ...      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sylvain used to tell me that he prefers not to tell some people that he has a girlfriend i thought it was weird. Ok I don't go bragging to everyone i meet that i have a bf, but if it comes up i don't care saying it. He told me that some people can be jealous and it is not a nice feeling. I didn't pay too much attention to that saying that i don't want to get paranoid. Well today, after 2 months, some teachers (from Greek families) in the school heard that i had a bf. And of course the first question was:   Is he greek?   It is funny how people are self-centred. When i am around Lebanese people they ask if he is Lebanese. As if the only guys who have real potential are Lebanese or Greek.... And then, they started making comments about how French Canadian people are "vite en affaire" and yadi yadi yada. I really felt awkward after that. I kind of resent them right now. None of these people has a bf... and they asked questions without really being interested, but just to gossip -- i feel. I don't know if it had anything to do with jealousy. I am not that kind and I find it hard to understand why people are jealous. But all i know, is that i don't want to share any part of my life with these people. &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; En plus (over more) yesterday i was talking with my  urlLink cousin  that not all Lebanese and not all Greek people are close minded and superficial and judgmental... and and and.... But experiences like that do not help me in not having those thoughts. I know that not all Canadians or French Canadians are judgment-free, but I guess since I am not completely  one of them , they will never make racial comments in front of me... and when they do, they try in any way to hide it and make it seem as a joke. Markella, you are right, it sucks.   To Lebanese people, I am this half Greek-Lebanese girl lost between 3 cultures and who can't see clearly the true values of life, who is forgetting how to speak Lebanese, who doesn't appreciate real music, and who has a French-Canadian accent when speaking French...&nbsp; I must be a heretic since i go out with a French Canadian and i don't go to church, and i actually consider meditation as a good tool to feel &quot;good&quot; and that I have muslim friends coming over at my place without my mom interfering!!   To Greek people, I am this half Greek-Lebanese person who just doesn't know the true value of being Greek.   And to the others... I am this half Greek-Lebanese girl who is well integrated in the North-American culture, but still have a French accent from France (go figure)&nbsp; , and a weird whatever English accent, and who knows SO MANY OTHER languages (wow) (euh.. only Greek, Arabic and Spanish... do they realise i don't master ANY of those? it just looks good on a resumé!) and they think that My Big Fat Greek Wedding is the exact replica of my family... and they say that it is a cultural experience to stay at my place! And even then, i do feel myself when i hang out with non-lebanese or non-greek people, because i feel they have no expectations of how i should be and what i should think and what i should believe in. It may sound like I don't have an identity, but I do. I know who i am, i know what i like, i believe in my values and ideals. And i am lucky to have family members to share this with (because we don't choose them.. do we?) Feel free to comment. Since it is my first log where i know people will read... and i am not sure what u guys think.    On a lighter note, here is a new picture that represents me - right now.

      After all these days, I finally wake up, full of energy! Yeah!  I heard recently that I may have 2 readers ! Yeah... Well, 2 readers is good enough for me. I never thought that someone would actually check everyday if I updated it. But Thank you Christine, and Rami (though I am sure my brother said he does it just to make me feel good).   So for them, for Christine, here are my thoughts :) hehe. Actually I found an interesting blog lately.  urlLink JERUSALEM WANDERINGS  It is a lady that I would guess is in her thirties I am not sure. She grew up in the Bronx (I think)and lives in jerusalem now with her family. She is Jewish, but promotes peace between arabs and jews and has some interesting storing in her blog, as well as some cute pictures. I suggest you go see it  urlLink JERUSALEM WANDERINGS   On her blog, I got the link for a  urlLink All Nations Cafe  It is set in Jerusalm, and seems to have nice activities for people from both religions. These things are really wonderful, But since I am here, and not there, I don't know if the All Nations Cafe is really a place of peace. I would assume so, but I am sure you get some tension there. What makes me sad, is that we never hear about those stories in the news. We don't hear about people who make effort to change the perception of people around them. It should be called Bad News at 6. What I Know is that for this deep hatred that exists in this region, it takes more than a cafe and an open minded lady, but it is where it starts. You change, and people around you can change. Be the change you want to see in the world. This is what I think, But how long will it take until people realize that hate won't take them anywhere? There is this org. Called  urlLink Seeds of Peace  They have summer camps for Greek/Turkish teenagers, Jews/Arabs teens, Pakistanis/Indians teens - they want to develop trust and empathy for one another and plant a seed in the teens, for when they go home, they can share their experience. The teens can see that we are the all same after all. But anyhow, you know as much as I do, that hatred can be so deep.sad.  *sigh* - ok I don't have time to re-read what I wrote, Today is the "Olympiad" at the school. so I need to go prepare the kids for the parade and the Olympic flame :) Have a nice day Tina. (Rami just told me that he doesn't know the address of this blog - he lost it... so here, it is just you and me)

       Reality ...  what is reality. is my reality similar to yours. Even if two people are living the same thing, in the same world, their reality is different. Caused by their inner (fucked up) reality. Why some kids turn out shy when their siblings rule the world. They have the same parents, the same environment. I believe more and more that everything , everything is only an illusion of what I want to see. From our different realities we can learn... But we can also destroy because we can't accept difference.   My reality today  : I want more ice-cream and I want the fries of Dragon Rouge  Mood:  annoyed by everything and almost everyone  Weather : sunny/cloudy  Food : too much ( blame it on PMSing)  Happy 'bout : was walking down Maisonneuve, and some kids were having a book sale. They had around 20 books to sell. So I asked few questions, and they were so excited when I bought their first book. 1$ I miss my monsters.  Crappy 'bout : Life's synchronization.  Other : Isn't cool to discover you have many things in common with new friends?  Rea's mantra of the day : Rea, be  rea listic

      Have you ever wondered who are your friends? Do you really know your friends? to what extend do you know your friends? Do your friends know you? Do all your friends need to know every side of you? What is friendship anyways? Does pure friendship between a guy and a girl (straight) exist? or between 2 gay or lesbians? some people say no - some say yes...  i don't know.  They say:  Friendship is a comfy situation like home. You get home, kick off your shoes, relax and sigh, "Ahh, home."  Is friendship based on needs? can you be friends with someone if you don't need that person? can you be friends just to hang out? or hanging out is a need?  When does friendship stops and becomes love? What if it was always love? Then does it become fake friendship, build on a secret purpose?  What do you do when you hurt a friend? Why do we need to please people all the time? Frankly sometimes i don't care, some other times, i feel i need to make people around me happy in order to feel comfortable. But then i need to remember, i am not here to save anyone. Everyone has his own feet. And i have mine. And mine don't know where to go.
