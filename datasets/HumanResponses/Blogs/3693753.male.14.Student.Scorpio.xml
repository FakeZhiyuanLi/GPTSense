       Dot - Child Genius: Home Schooling #703  Characters: Mo Collins ~ Mrs. Goddard Michael McDonald ~ Mr. Ronald Goddard Alex Borstein ~ Karen Goddard Stephanie Weir ~ Dot Goddard Andrew Daly ~ Newscaster Will Sasso ~ News Cameraman  (Scene opens w/camera on a newscaster Mrs. Goddard, Mr. Goddard & Karen are seated on the couch. (No sign of Dot) Camera pans back & you can see the camera man that is filming the newscaster.)  Newscaster: Welcome back to good morning Phoenix. We’re here in the home of Mr. & Mrs. Ronald Goddard which is also, coincidentally the classroom for their daughter 7 yr old child-prodigy Karen Goddard.  Karen: Ah Tah Ho Wa which means greetings in Miari which is the native tongue of the people indigenous to New Zealand. It’s also one of 7 languages in which I’m fluent. I am currently a college sophomore equivalent & I’ve recently been accepted to the graduate programs at MIT, Princeton, & Dartmouth. And all of that thanks to the educated commitment of my parents.  Dad: Thank you very much sweetheart.  Mom: Thank you, sweetie.  Newscaster: Alright, so first things first. Why home schooling?  (In the background Dot comes to the door & tries to open it, the door is locked & she continues to pound & knock but the parents ignore her.)  Dad: Well, we just felt that we were better equipped to handle the educational needs & the enormous capacity for learning of our daughter Karen.  Dot: The door’s locked.  Newscaster: Looks like you got somebody at your door there.  Karen: Oh, that’s Dot. Hi! (Karen waves)  Dot: Hi, the door’s locked.  Dad: Oh that’s one of the Neighbor kids.  Dad: Anyways, as I was saying we remain committed to our daughter’s education. It’s the utmost importance to us & we take it very, very seriously.  (Dot crawls in through the doggy door & sits on the chair opposite the newscaster.)  Newscaster: Well, hello there.  Dot: My swing-set tipped over, I think maybe I was swinging too high.   Karen: That’s my twin sister dot. Are you okay?  Dot: I was trapped underneath my swing-set.  Newscaster: I, I thought you said that Karen here was an only child.  Mom: Um, Dot honey uh, why don’t you go play in your room?  Dot: I can’t mom, cuz my body is still underneath the swing-set.  (Dot gets up & starts flapping her arms like they are wings & skips around behind them & gets in their faces.)  Dot: I’m just dot’s spirit. And I’m floating, & I’m floating around.  (Mr. Goddard leans into Dot real close.)  Dad: Then go towards the light Dot.  (Mr. Goddard motions towards the newscaster to continue his questioning.)  Dad: Go ahead.  Newscaster: Should we wait?  Dad: Not at all, don’t worry.   Karen: Dot truly has an enviable imagination.  Mom & Dad (together): No you, have the enviable imagination, you do.  Karen: Yeah, you’re right I do.  Newscaster: So, do you home-school the two girls together or separately?  Karen: Oh, no dot’s not home schooled. Mom & Dad send her to public school.  Mom: She likes it.  Dad: Dot attends Hoorjay Washington elementary.  (Dot springs up into view from behind the couch in between her parents.)  Dot: I used to go to school there, I did but now that I’m a spirit I’m not allowed so, me & God & Jesus are gonna go to the movies instead.  (Mr. Goddard stands up & grabs hold of Dot & pushes her down into the chair. He trades places w/mom while doing this putting him closest to Dot now.)  Dad: All three of you are gonna get punished if you don’t sit down.  Dot: Even God & Jesus?  Dad: Especially God & Jesus.  Newscaster: Ah, so what made you decide to educate your two girls differently?  Dad: Well, Our daughters are clearly very different & therefore have different educational needs.  Mom: And Dot likes cafeterias.  Dot: Everybody there has to wear gloves it’s the law. I wish the whole world was like that.  (Mr. Goddard Glares at Dot for a really long time & there is silence, Dot looks really uncomfortable & squirms in her seat.)   Newscaster: I see well, Mr. Goddard, Mr. Goddard?   Dad: I’m sorry. Go ahead.  Newscaster: Ah how do you respond to critics who argue that home schooling can impair a child’s social skills?   Dad: I think that’s nonsense. We make sure that Karen interacts w/other home schooled girls & that enables us to keep track of who her friends are.  (Dot springs into view again leaning over Mr. Goddard’s shoulder & bounces all around.)  Dot: My friend Hector Agular gave me head lice. He did. I had a million bugs livin’ in my head. They were all over my hair weren’t they? Do you remember?   Mom: Stop.   Dot: My mother, she had to put medicine on my head so that she could kill them all & she thought she did & then my Dad got it. I gave him head lice, He had to shave his head & his back cause he had them all runnin around. It was the funniest thing you ever saw.   Dad: Sit, Sit Down  (Dot has been jumping all around this whole time & is now in front of the couch. Mr. Goddard shakes Dot & pulls her onto the floor in front of her & smacks her on the head.)  Dot: Ow you hit me on the head. Mrs. Nesbit says you shouldn’t hit; that if you’re angry you should use words.   (Mr. Goddard leans into Dot really close.)  Dad: Okay fine. Shut up!  Newscaster: Could we get a look at what a typical day of home-schooling is like?   Dad: Oh sure!  (The newscaster stands & the whole family moves over to the kitchen area behind the couch.)  Newscaster: How bout it? Okay great! Just Pretend I’m not here.  Dot: So Pretend that I’m a unicorn.   (Dot put’s her hands on top of her head to make a horn like a unicorn. She stands behind the center island. The rest of them are in front. She leans over a tray of milk & other food.)  Mom: We like to start each school day with a balanced nutritious meal to ensure Kerens’ productivity.  Dot: What is that?   (Mrs. Goddard picks up the tray of food, pulling it away from Dot’s reach.)  Mom: And then we discuss the days’ lesson plan.  Dot: That looks like food.  Dad: What inspires you today Karen?  (In the Background, Dot gets up on the counter & is rummaging around through the cupboards, clumsily.)  Karen: Well, I thought we could start off where we left off last week & we could talk about the concealed paradox of mathematics & physics. I think that both fields are very interesting…   Dot: I’m gonna have pop tarts, I got pop tarts.   (Dot falls off the counter really hard & lands on the floor behind the island.)  Newscaster: Oh, my God!  Karen: Dot, are you okay?   Dad: She’s fine, she’s fine. Go ahead.  Karen: Dad she fell.  (Karen runs around back to where Dot is laying.)  Karen: Dot, are you okay?  Dot: Karen, look at my arm.   (Dot stands up & has a prop arm wrapped around behind her head & she’s holding the wrist w/her other hand.)  Karen: Oh, my God! I think you separated the clavicle.  Dot: Look, I got a new scarf! My Hand.  (Dot throws the arm around her neck in the manner you would a scarf.)  Karen: Don’t touch it Dot.  (Mr. Goddard walks over to Dot.)  Dot: No, no, no Dad can I keep it please? I wanna show my friends.   Dad: No, No, I’m taking her to the free clinic.   Karen: But Dad you’re a doctor!?   Dad: She likes the free clinic!  (Mr. Goddard picks Dot up & as he is walking out the door w/her over his shoulder, she grabs her wrist, still wrapped around her neck & waves w/it.)  Dot: Bye everybody.

[Hermione enters, wearing a blouse with a plunging neckline, and possessing rather significant cleavage]   Hermione: I got here hours ago. I've been in the library, reseraching cloaking spells.   Ron: Ah, heh, ah, Hermione! Mmmmm...ha, oh, er.   Harry: Hello, Hermione. Welcome back. How was your summer?   Hermione: Boring. Nothing happened.   Harry: Really? Seems like a lot happened.   Hermione: I don't know what you're talking about.   Ron: I can think of a couple things that happened. It's just that, you see, it's only been a few months since we last saw you, yet, um, ah, ha...wow! [Harry fixes him with a glare]   Harry: Ron just means that, ah, you look very nice, Hermione.
