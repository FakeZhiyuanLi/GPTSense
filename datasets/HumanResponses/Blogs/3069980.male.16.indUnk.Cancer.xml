      The last few days have been some of the best in a long time... Saturday was my 16th birthday, and ,as I said before I was at a recording studio... On our way back, we just happened to get on the same bus as Caroline and her friends, although I didn't notice till they were getting off. (dunno if I woulda said anything even if I had noticed before...) Well, later on, I got a text from her asking me out... After recovering from the shock I said yes and were going out next weekend...yay!!  Sunday was pretty uneventful, slept till 12, didn't do very much for the rest of the day...  Today was good, was back at the recording studio, had a great time, although they made me sing which was quite embarrassing...

      Why do things always have to be like this? Just when things had started to get better, I go and totally fuck up and end up making things worse for everyone... Last week I got talking to a girl (a friend of a friends friend), funny, random, and about as totally nuts as they come (which, don't get me wrong, isn't a bad thing). And even though I haven't actually met her, I think she's a great person. Well anyway, last night when I was talking to her, she said something completely out of the blue that surprised me quite a lot, and I didn't quite know what to say... What I said was pretty stupid, and now she thinks that I don't feel the same way about her as she does about me... I wish there was something I could say to put all of this right, but I'm afraid that what I say will just make things worse...

      ARGH!! Got "jumped" (oh how I hate that word)... Rather large group of NEDs came swarming out of there little holes as we were going past... Mainly little fuck bitch girls... They followed us halfway down the street, then started beating up my friend's girlfriend... I mean, how can you do that? Meanwhile my friend just stood there trying to think what to do.(we kinda have this thing about hitting girls...) I couldn't just do nothing, threw some of them off so Maxine and Ferg could run. Then along came the boyfriends, armed with, guess what.........Their own shoes... Another one of my friends, (who happened to be carrying a baseball bat)turned round and they ran like hell... Not the nicest night ever... I'm kinda ok, cut just below my eye, probably some bruises on my face, but I'm ok.

      Got up, went into town, met two friends who I haven't seen for months. Had a great laugh with them.  Got stopped in the street by an old man who stood there pointing at me and shouting "Your a Punk!!!" :/ Yes old man, I'm a punk... LOL.  Ran into 2 girls from my school(one of whom, once threatened to stab me...)a grand total of 8 times, if I didn't know that they hate me I would have said they were stalking me, although they probably thought the same about me...  Missed the train home, stood in the freezing station for ages...  Got home and had a nice conversation with a nice-sounding random (a friend of a friend of a friend(don't ask...))   Hmm...Wonder what interesting things will happen tomorrow...

      Yesterday, I went to meet Caroline in town, we wandered for a bit, went to Starbucks (they sell the nicest strawberry frappuchinos ever...) wandered more, then got the train back to my house... Spoke to Paul (who is in Thailand) on MSN for a bit, and repeatedly fell off the sofa... We sat talking for hours (again) which was good fun... Later, I walked her down the road to get a bus, we missed one by literally a few seconds... Well, my night was pretty boring after that, but yah, was still good... ahh...

      Well, I haven't posted anything in about a week now. I could say I have been busy, but that would be a complete lie... I suppose I just couldn't think of anything to say...  Well anywhoo, what a week this has been...   Tuesday and Wednesday : Studio again, Wednesday we were actually recording, which was really great fun, especial listening to Sean sing...LOL... Got our CD's, everyone was "Very Impressed", yuh-huh...   Thursday/Friday : School, Spent most of the time in the Music Dept, Messing about with equipment and such...         After school on Friday I went to meet Caroline, At first I was ...Nervous... and that's an understatement... We didn't really do much, sat in Starbucks for a while, then walked all over the place in the rain... But it was still great fun... Caroline, what can I say about her?... She's great... Lovely, funny, and has things to say, which is more than me...   Saturday : Can't remember much happening, slept most of the day I think...   Sunday : perhaps the best day yet. Went to see Shrek 2 with Caroline, was alot better than I thought it would be, considering the first mention of Shrek sends shivers down my spine... euugghh... Afterwards, went to Caroline's house, sat for hours talking and listening to music.. Was fun... :) And my Dad didn't even notice I was late... LOL...
