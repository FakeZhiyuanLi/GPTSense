      we argued as always ... and he says he gives in... AS ALWAYS... he always make it a point to let me know he was the one who gave in...  oh well... why do we have to stay together if we're that different... we came from different worlds, culture, life, and i don't know what else.  should i stay or should i go? ah well, he said sorry anyway so what else? he called me a brat... am i? is it being a brat to continue the kind of life i live? he restricted my schedules... my friends, clothes and i don't know what else... i admit i do make sarcastic and snide remarks... but then those remarks do have basis. he himself gave me those ideas anyway.   upto what extend should i take in? he even told me before he met me, his idea of a life is living in a 10 sq mtr house... damn! what a house?!?!?! what kind of "simple life" does he intend to live? i admit i'm no simple person... people call me fashionista.. .but then that's me! i love to socialize... i think i'm not meant for him... he would never understand my lifestyle... i love to dress up... what should i do? i don't think i can give up the kind of life i love... am i being selfish? i'm not quite sure, i didn't even ask him to love me and make all those sacrifices... but then why do i feel so trapped?

      Hay... what am i gonna do... i've never been this buried in trouble before pero anung gagawin ko? SHIT!!!! Met a guy 9 months ago and he started courting me... sabi ko friends nalang muna kami... kasi he's not (i'm sure) gonna be accepted by my mom and sisters... waaah!!! kung alam lang nila kung gano ka violent ang taong ito... ummm... haven't proven it yet but a person wouldn't say anything na bad about themselves if not true diba? ang hirap... Hay... actually he's a paradox eh... a La Sallian Brother (former) he left the order just because of me... tapos malalaman ko scout ranger pala! good in martial arts and done things you wouldn't believe a person can do (if you lead the kind of life i did... aminado naman ako naging sheltered ang life ko... ) but then.. geez... scary na eh... he's threatening my friends!!! waaah! ok, ndi pala threat (sabi rin nya) it's not a threat if it will be done... eh kaya nya gawin!! anung laban ng mga friends ko diba?? AND i'm not allowed to communicate with my friends! ang hirap kasi 3/4 of my friends are of the male species... waaah!!!! at this point we're starting over.. no threats of violence and no lying(yep i did some lying coz i was afraid for my friends' life) especially my bestfriend (male) hay... is it all worth it? he said he wants to change and he needs me to help him change.. pero i feel like he's manipulating me!!! he's terribly intelligent (terribly coz he has a violent streak... he hasn't used it on me but then with all the talk of POSSIBLE  violence, wouldn't you just want to avoid it??) pero he knows i'm lying!!! he reads me like a book!!! hay... i need to think... a lot of my friends said to leave him na... kaya lang ... there's one other thing they don't know... ummmm... we already did IT... and i feel so bad... dahil sa kanya i've breached a lot of my principles and i feel like "damaged good"... tama ba? but i feel staying with him might mean inhibitions (clothes, friends and a lot of stuff...) he seems to be controlling things in my life one by one! i gave him a piece of my mind... but still iba na kung you're married diba? sad thing is his parents like me parang nahiya naman ako.. but as one friend said ... "d ka mabubuhay sa hiya!"  should i? or shouldn't i drop him? i need help...
