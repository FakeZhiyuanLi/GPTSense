      My little brother wrote this like aeons ago- and I kept it just so I could do something like this. His little bad butt is nothing like this anymore, but it's nice to think of the good old days when he was normal :D  Life  Theres something good to you Theats your Life Even though someday You will die  You Might go down To hell and cook Or go to heaven Obeying God is all it took  Life is the best to me Np matter which way the water flows Your life might be bad But thats how life goes  Living for al long time Is a very special gift Some people may die early But thats how life is  You Might Hate your Life You Might wish that you would die But a death wish is a bad thing To plant upon ones life  If you dont love your life You will never know who yu are In life you will Never get really far    By Maurice Johsnon

        "For Love"   I thought that I could do this   I thought I could make you see   You've found what you've been looking for-   This heart inside of me   You are so perfect in my eyes   Your flawas minor they are   The perfection I feel with you   Like the rising of the morning star   But in my silence is this heartache   No hope to gain your undying love   For every thought I ever have   Is choked back from the touch   That leads me to want you everyday   The voice I long to hear   Your jokes, your thoughts, your great talents   So like mine- draw me near,   But I am too afraid to tell you   Silence becomes my vow to spare   The tender heart I've grown to love   The spirit so close to my every care.

      Okay okay okay... I dont have anything new 'cause I can't write on command, but I got a really good recent one to get the ball rolling... April 27.2004 Foolish Heart  I can’t pretend this is the first time & you know damn well it’s not, I learn to depend only on me ‘cause myself is all I’ve got Don’t act like you don’t know What this is all about I’ve become so used to this pain I don’t know how I live without This pain feels like the knife You slid into my back & every night of sleep I’ve lost Trying not to react My chest goes numb every time I force myself not to cry & that only happens every night When I’m alone & can’t help but wonder why I can’t pretend it’s okay anymore To be so sad I can’t move on Tomorrow when I open my eyes I’ll wish that you were gone But you’ll always be around to twist That knife into this heart of mine U that’s how I know you have no soul; No feeling, no heart, no spine You’ve never felt pain so deep It clouds your mind so you can’t see Or you’d never feel good about this pain That you daily inflict on me.

      Here are a couple pieces that I dedicated to the Insomiac's Corner conference on the Poets and Writers website. I have quite a few of my poems posted over there- and there are some really good writers to bounce your ideas off of if you want to check it out here is the site http://www.pw.org --- go to the Speakeasy, you have to register, but its well worth it.  12/27/99 "To Add to My Sleepless Rest"  Lately I've had to think myself to sleep, And I wonder if it will ever stop- This painful beating of my heart; But my problems far outweigh my happy days, And the more I think about them, The more my heart starts to numb, And I can't feel anymore happiness; No more pain, no more anything, Since everyone I love has done something wrong.  Lately I haven't been able to think, Things have confused me to the point of pain, And what can I really consider to be truth, Since no one ever has any for me; My best friend started our whole existence- Upon a lie I can't rely on, And everyone that I've ever known, Has had a lie in their thoughts- In their heart is a bitter cruelty I cannot live with, And every person I've ever trusted, Turned their backs on me when they voiced those hated lies.  My best friend doesn't love me; He doesn't care what I do or who I am, Only that I'll be there when he's lonely And there's no one else to rely on, I know now that I can't trust him, And that he has no respect for my love, This is just another one of the problems That numbs me while I hope for sleep, And the rest that is clouded with dreams to follow The emptieness caused by unwanted love.  8/3/2001 "A Piece for the Corner" Tonight of all nights I haven't Been able to sleep as much As I have the past few months I've been without your touch Everyday the weight's been lighter But the pain is still the same It's a shame that I cant go a day Without speaking or thinking your name So many things remind me of you I don't know how I Get through each day in once piece The hurt makes me wanna cry But I knew that with my silence I was pushing you farther away But only in my silence Would you choose to stay So tonight I haven't been able to sleep & I know now why I don't TEll you the feelings I'm feeling & expect you to care 'cause you wont.

      Here are some of my favorite poems for now I'll start posting the stuff eventually... life is hectic right now  1/22/97- Age: 15 "Pure" When I look into your eyes I see mountains and their reflections in the clear blue of a lake; Beautiful rainbows and waterfalls surrounded by life and encased in a bright blue sky. When I look in your eyes I see the eyes of our children; I look at your face to see their features and their smile, And I can tell by the look in your eyes that in me you see the same. When we touch I feel that we belong together; like pieces of a puzzle, and i can feel your heart beat the way mine beats for yours; the way your hands tremble as they reach for mine. When we're close and we kiss, a certain sweetness; a powerful perfection caused coincidentally by love's hold on our lives, feeds as the perfume of your skin weaves its way into my soul. When we talk I like to listen; your voice is like a soothing medicine for the ache in my soul; When I speak I know you'll listen and you know I'll listen too. When I reach into your soul I feel the pull, I see the love and I hear the cry from the ache in your soul, telling me you see my ache, and you see my heart; it swells with love for you.  5/1/2004 My crazy heart wont stop loving you No matter how much I try I think of all the reasons why I shouldnt & all the times you've made me cry You seem to have a part of me That I wanted to let go I know you dont care if I love you but I just wanted you to know So jut how much do I love you? Let me tell you now: There is no other on this earth That I love more than I love you now It's so much that it makes my chest hurt & I worry about you every moment I'm awake Just when I think I've had enough I wonder how much more I can take & when I'm not near you you always seem To fill the thoughts in my mind, At night I dream about you & the memories left behind & if you ever wonder if This love I have is true, Just know that every day that I wake up Is another day I'm missing you.  7/28/99 Love What is love? It is a moment undefinded, It is a place of understanding, it is a shared heart of life- Its victories, its sorrows, Its mistakes, its successes.  Love is the good with the bad, Love is the acceptance of faults, Love is the willingness to overlook.  But most of all- Love is the desire to please, Love is the sacrifice of greed, Love is the blinding moment that words fall too short of to express... In the glance of love, emotions speak to the soul- numbing the mind with the esscence of love. It is the raw chemistry of life shaclking our decisions of choice- leaving us helpless vicitms to its power. Love can heal or love can hurt- Love can carry you to the heavens, Love can drown you in dying pain- It cares not the direction for love is truly blind, Love is not a place- It is a ride to that place.

      I hate to leave you; You've grown so close to me my friend, But you are the one, The very special one- who's feelings I cannot seem to touch, Your mind is a mystery to me, So much that I am amazed everyday & I do not understand how; How your actions speak to me When your mind, your very soul- will not. I thought you had no feelings for me that first day so full of conversation, & then you opened up to me &amp; I thought I'd fly away at your very touch & then you spoke to me &amp; I smiled Your every word something I looked forward to, & I wonder why I did Because I seem to be at a loss for you. I hate to love you; I promised to let you know when I did, Yet it's a secret I keep to myself, One I think you know about but you dont say so, You let me keep telling you what I dont feel, And now you're waiting- Waiting for me to tell the truth with your every word & you constantly give me reasons to say it But the longer I wait, The farther you go- Away from love; away from me.

      So, I'm sitting at the bar Friday and I see a guy that looks like one of my exes. Mind you, Scott has been being a dick to me and now he's hooked up with a good friend of mine so he's totally cut off. He doesnt know it yet and he must think he's the best lay I've had in a while but sometimes when ya wanna get your rocks off, you wanna get your rocks off. There's this little double standard that says that guys can be players and women cant. It's really shitty that Scott thinks he has the right to keep me from talkin to anybody else. My ex-roommate did the same thing so I guess it's a guy thing. Well anyway, a new guy came into the bar and I am just starin 'cause I think baby is fly - when here comes Scott, walkin into my line of sight over and over all of a sudden. Then he pokes me so hard in one of my ribs I thought he mighta broke it- and gets all in my face "you gonna go with me to get my tongue pierced?" Like I dont know what's goin on. You're not that smart, dummy. I've come to the conclusion that it's just something about me that turns guys off. If I was a white girl, I'd have no problem getting a guy- it wouldnt matter if I was fat, ugly, whatever. They just seem to like white girls a little more than they like black girls. In the meantime, I'm heavily debating going to see that ex-fuckbuddy person and I'm just... not sure if I should. I dont like feeling like I'm one of the ho's ya know? I know I'm not, but when all you get out of somebody that's supposed to be your friend first is sex, it kinda puts a damper on the relationship. Most days I dont even wanna be bothered with men at all. I think I am so rare of a person, guys are scared to death of me. Everything would be allright if I was just white. Since I'm such an underachiever when it comes to guys, I'm making myself an overachiever at everything else- even my drinking has improved. That's sad. Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just not as important, and I know that's not true. But I cant help the way I feel. I feel like a failure most days because all my friends have kids and families and I cant have any of that. Maybe one day I'll find somebody to settle down with, but guys tend to lean towards the fertle girls, and I"m not one of those. Some days I feel like I"m sinking further and further into depression because of it, but you know me... I'm not going to let it get to me. That promise I made to not "do something stupid" will be a promise I"ll always keep. I feel like I'm going crazy when I think like that, but I know I'm not. I am just so sick and tired of being passed over... bout the time the guy realizes that i"m the one he should have been with, I'm not interested anymore. I've actually been interested in the same person for over a year, but I know as soon as he realizes where he should be, I wont be interested anymore... that's just the way it goes. We'll drift further apart than we already are and one day we wont be friends anymore... that's the way it goes. Laters. -Me

      This post is for everyone... I'm tired of pretending to be something I'm not. It holds a lot of truths, a lot of secrets, a lot of things I just plain feel ashamed of- so you might want to read it all. This kinda has to go back a long ways, 'cause the reason I am the way I am is because of things that happened long ago. Like me getting literally run over by a car when I was 8 or 9... My legs were touching my back because of the way I got ran over and I probably should be in a wheelchair right now, but I'm not. I know it's all in my mind, but I'm deathly afraid of cars and that's why. I dont drive nor will I ever. Walking most places around here is good excercise and it never hurt anybody. If you think I'm stupid or crazy for not wanting to drive, tell it to those people who died last year in car accidents... oh that's right, they're dead, you cant :| It kind of sucks that my parents really worked a number on me when I was younger. I was taught to believe that they didnt care about me and that they didnt want me around... My mom pretty much told my dad to take me 'cause she didnt want me. My little brother was primarily my responsibility from the time I was 12 until I turned 18. I was molested, but for some reason, I didnt know anything about not letting people touch my "privates" so I didnt know it was wrong and nothing was ever done about it. Maybe that's why I'm going to say what I'm about to say, but it's the truth nevertheless. I like girls. Not all the time, and not every girl. That's kinda tacky. I'm tired of lying or keeping it hidden from everybody. If you didnt already know, I never liked you that way. If you did know, I wont come onto you so dont worry. I dont come onto girls anyway... Its a very particular girl that I like and it's very rare that I want to date one. Karri Cessna was my girlfriend, not my roommate and we only slept in seperate rooms because I wasnt quite comfortable with liking girls... I guess my religious background is why but I like em and I cant stop myself. If that causes problems for you, too bad. I cant change who I am I can only suppress it and I'm sick of trying to please you people. If I'm going to go to hell then so be it. That's between me and God. I'm sick of pretending that I'm so happy all the time. The truth is? I'm almost never happy and more than that? I'm suffering from depression but I will never go on medication. No need. I used to be suicidal when I was 12-13... then I met Shimron and all of that changed. He was initially my best friend... went through everything with me. Up until I met him I just kept everything to myself and so did he. Both middle children with lots of responsibility and anger we were just that couple. We only actually dated for a few months but we were off and on all thru highschool. The first time we broke up he made me promise not to do "anything stupid" and I will always keep that promise to him, no matter what's going on. So there's not ever a chance that I will kill myself. I may talk about it but it'll never happen. I have to live with my depression because it reminds me how far I've come. I did try to kill myself once when I was 12- right in my mother's face and she laughed at me. It kinda looses it's sting after that. The last time we broke up, in lieu of just saying "its not going to work out" he had his roomie pretend that he didnt know who I was (even though he paged me and that's why I was calling) and ask me if I was all these different girls. Then he gave me the old heave-ho. I was in love with that boy... and I havent been in love since. Anybody who thinks they can make me fall in love with them would be wrong. My heart hurts so much it's like a physical pain because of him. I will never let myself stop loving him because I never want to forget how much it hurts to get dumped that way. I havent been dumped quite the same way since. Nobody has really mattered that much since. I may love you, but I'll never be in love with you. I'm to paranoid to let myself go that much and by the time I decide to consider it, you let me know you're not worth it. I compare every guy to him because for all intents and purposes of a relationship, he's wonderful, attentive, loving, caring, and he still cares about me. He still loves me too- which is why he thinks he doesnt know what love is, but that's okay. He can think what he wants to... I know the truth. I'm not a good girl either. I'm not going to lie anymore and tell you that I'm so perfect and I dont do anything wrong. I've stole, borrowed and havent returned, and I definitely am not going to pretend that I've never done drugs... that I havent overindulged more than once and that I still do mess with them on occaision- tho the occaision is becoming very far and inbetween, so let's not dwell on that. I wonder why it is that guys think that an insult would be considered a compliment in the eyes of a fat girl? I dont think they're compliments. Just because I'm not the cutest girl in the world, and I'm fat, doesnt mean that I'm just going to be your slave and let you run all over me. Maybe some stupid girls you know do that, but I'm quite intelligent, I'm told everyday how much I mean to some and they happen to be cuter than any guy that's tried to give me those stupid lines and put me down. I dont like liars either, like the guy who told me he was going to school at Wayne State yet never seems to have any books at his house and still hasnt returned to school. Yeah... that was really cute. Why lie about something that is so easy to confirm it borders on stupid? That'd be like me wearing a blue shirt and telling you it was red. Doesnt make sense does it? I always have books at my house... I dont know about any OTHER college students, but if you study at home or at school- you still tend to keep your books with you. I heard an old Hootie and the Blowfish song last night and it almost made me cry. Shimron sang that song to me once. I guess that's why I'm a sucker for guys that sing to me, but they take it way too far. I already know what it feels like to get my heart broken and it's not an experience I wish to repeat. Just how much does it hurt? It has taken me this long to make myself just numb to the hurt I've already endured. Everytime someone hurts my feelings, I feel like I'm a glutton for punishment 'cause I never can cut them loose. People take that for granted I'm sure because let me tell you, I'm sick of these people just thinking that it's okay to hurt me over and over and thinking that just 'cause they give me a little sob story I'll forgive and things will be the same. Not anymore they wont. I hurt so much that I cannot breathe, I hurt so much that I cannot be sane, normal, or happy, until I find someone. Everytime I see new babies I wanna cry because I will never have one, but it's okay. I'll adopt some and get to give some kids a life like I never had. Sometimes it hurts me to watch my best friend with her family and her kids because my family was never like that and while I really love them all, sometimes the pain is just too much to take. Maybe I'm just not allowed to be happy, I dont know, but you guys dont help. So if you're out there thinking that your sweet nothings are going to get you laid, save it for another day 'cause right now, I'm not in the mood. I think I've had enough dick to last me a lifetime and I really dont think that I'm too far behind some of you guys... I wont give you an exact number, but it's more than I can count on fingers and toes and no I dont feel like a ho. And yes, that's including women- (and yes, I've slept with more than one) and I cant help it if I have a more-than-natural sexual appetite. Espeicially for a woman I hear. I'm always careful, I have no diseases and never have- so I consider myself lucky. For all of you who this is shocking right now, I hope you're happy that your perfect friend is far from perfect. I"m giving up this pretense of being "the good girl" from now on. I get my religion in a bottle now and that's the way it's gonna be. I have no problem with bein the alcoholic that I am and fuck what you're talking about. I cant do drugs 'cause they arent legal, but I can drink myself into a stupor an it's a-okay. Oh yeah- and F.Y.I. I dont go behind skanks so if I see you talkin to one, I will assume you're fuckin her and I will not fuck you. Laters folks :D Love ya all. This is me

      Well sometimes I feel like maybe I shouldnt write all this stuff on here 'cause who knows who'll see it right? Forget that. I'm spillin my guts here- if you dont like it that's too bad. Well I met someone new last weekend and needless to say, considering the drought that has been goin on strong for 6 months, I ended it. Um, he looks kinda like an old roommate (strictly platonic) that I kinda ended on bad terms with. Well things are in that "mushy" stage where you just get all hot and bothered when you see him and funny things happen to your body. He doesnt help when he's messin with me either. He's the karaoke host at Arts. He's also 11 years older than me so I have to watch out for old hags AND the young broads. I'm sitting at the table and the chick across from me tells me she dated him last year. I looked at her and then looked at him and I'm like wtf? What was he thinkin? and if he likes girls like that, why is he tryin to talk to me? I sure can pick em huh? Anyway, so I've been talkin about the ex-roomie because the friend looks kinda like him... And then I got to thinkin about the rumor that our next door neighbor started saying he kicked me out of the house 'cause I wouldnt sleep with him. It was totally untrue, not that I wouldnt sleep with him- he's a slut beyond most sluts. Not sayin he isnt hot tho. :D So because of that rumor, he had his kid's mom try to jump me at my favorite bar- not a good idea. Well he showed up as I'm bein all mushy with the karaoke guy at my table... waits around a while for me to speak- but when I dont, and the karaoke guy is long gone, he plops himself down in front of me. Even gave me a hug! what's up with that? Claiming his territory or something??? Beats me! It did occur to me that maybe because Scott saw the guy, he kinda got upset that someone was all over me and decided to invite one of his old hags up to the bar 'cause some lady seemed to take all his attention and people seemed to be kinda keeping her preoccupied when she came in. He's not my man, so I really dont care, but when I think about the events the night we slept together, it makes me wonder just who he's been with and so I'm not likely to have a recapp of that night. Then, everybody at Hiller's plotted against me and now I'm pissed off at them and i'm never going back for real. I was gonna visit occaisionally now that I have a job, but nope. My friend Rae asked me to go out and when I called her she was at Hillers- no big deal. Cylinthia was also there- major problem. She gave me this big sob story about how she misses me and she feels like a piece of her life is missing yada, yada, yada.... See, back in like, November, she and I got into a fight- which her new friend instigated... and she called me a "nigger-bitch" and almost killed me trying to drive me home while she was tripping. So what was the fight about? I was trying to help her out by not letting her argue with her boyfriend or his brother- and I happened to be talking to the brother at the time. He's asking me where we are and I'm trying to distract his attention- of course since nobody knew what I was talking about its kinda funny how her friend started telling her that I was talking about her and her boyfriend and she flipped out. It's also really funny how that same friend that she had been complaining about because she was trying to be "just like her" was all of a sudden her best friend and I was the one who was getting treated like a liar. I've never lied to that girl in my life and I was already in shock that she would even believe someone who was irritating her over me, but it was too late. She believed that girl above me even though we've been through so much together. That girl took me out partying so many times and almost got me in trouble. I've had stuff slipped in my drink, almost been raped (and I'm not even sure to this day if I was or not- thank goodness I didnt catch anything if I was), I've stuck by her through lots and this is how I get repaid- AGAIN. It makes  me wonder what I'm doing here. So she takes me and drops me off in front of my best friend's house- not my house. I'm sitting outside in the cold and her boyfriend's brother calls. We're fighting because of her boyfriend, mind you. He comes and gets me and we get to their house and who's there now? Cylinthia- acting as if nothing even happened. I'm in Jake's room and Abraham comes to the door and asks if Jake's alone- and of course he says yes, but he knows I'm in there. So does Abraham. He asked her to say what she said when I wasnt there and she said, "I'm never talking to that nigger bitch ever again" and he repeated it to make sure I heard. I cried for three hours over that girl and I got my heart broken one more time. So I go home and pick up the pieces and go on with my life. I've seen her since then and she never says a word to me. Now she wants to make up and be friends. I'm not stupid. No way is it gonna happen. To add insult to injury, she actually says she doesnt know what happened and then tries to smooth things over between me and Becky. DO YOU THINK I'M FUCKING STUPID? I hope you dont. :| Sometimes it takes something drastic to get through to these people that I am NOT a punching bag. You think you hurt? I can tell you that when you've spent half your life taking care of other people- including her, keeping her from starving herself and making sure she was okay, there is no worse feeling than to know that you dont mean shit to these people at the end of the day. You're just another player in the game no matter how hard you try. I only have ONE best friend in this whole world, and her name is Hortencia. She has been the only one to stick by me through everything and she would never disrespect or hurt me that way and expect me to be okay with it. That's just stupid. That Becky girl? I'm supposed to be okay with her and hang out with the two of you after she instigated a huge fight, got you so pissed at me that you couldnt see straight, you actually tell me that if I want to get out of your car, I better jump out and you refuse to even stop at red lights- and I'm supposed to just let it go? I forgave a long time ago, I have no choice, but I damn sure dont have to forget how I felt that day. I will never forget. You will be lucky if you get to be more than a piece of shit that I scraped off the bottom of my shoe now. One too many times and I dont have to deal with you just because you come to me crying. I wonder if Jake even told her that I left him a voicemail telling him that if he couldnt let it go, we couldnt speak. I'm tired of getting my heart broke and gettin stepped on because I love people so much that I just cant let them go. It's time to cut them loose 'cause I realize now, if it were me? they'd drop me in a heartbeat. No questions asked, right Cylinthia? This is one hellatious vent. I gotta go. :D

      I might as well admit it now. I love Flint. Everything about flint is me, right down to the crime and destruction- which isnt really that bad if you think about it. People get mugged other places but rarely do you ever hear of it happening here. I dont feel afraid to walk down the street by myself; these streets were my playground growing up. If I ever doubted that they were, just being alive and well and being able to have a neighborhood bar "where everybody knows your name" like the song says, lets me know I"ve earned this right to be here and to love my city as much as I damn well please and you may not like it, but that's too fucking bad. I love Flint. You can talk about how bad it is here all you want, but I dont see it that way. I have lots of family that isnt by blood- especially on the eastside- which everybody thinks is so bad. They say we have prostitutes- there's prostitutes on S. Dort, but ya dont see them talkin about that like they do ours. There's some on Saginaw Street but ya dont hear em talkin about that either. Really there's a prostitute or slut pretty much everywhere you go, but for some reason it's not talked about unless it's on a "bad" side of town- but all four sides are bad so what's the difference? I guess the reason why I'm saying all this is because I feel totally out of place taking my friends to my "neighborhood" bars... I have three right now- Art's Pub on Lewis (yes lewis street where the hookers are LOL), Jans Tavern on Davison Rd, and Ragtop used to be my absolute favorite but they are closed. Ragtop is the home of the Big Ass Burger- guaranteed to give you a big ass *grins*. Hiller's is across the street and they're okay too but, I like my big crowds and bein able to hang out and get a lil rowdy. :D Last night I was at Art's- havent been there in at least 5 years (yes thats right, I was a youngn when I was in there shhhhh!) and my friend Lori manages it so I promised her I would come out. I get there and not only is Lori there, Crystal is (girl from highschool) and just a bunch of people. My big brother Steve is there and then here comes the karaoke guy. I'm a country gal at heart myself so when this big tall guy comes in with his cowboy hat and boots and his nice fittin' jeans on, I just sat back an drooled. I heard my new favorite song all the way through last night too- Redneck Woman oh yea I will be singin that hot puppy a lot. It was fun once again to just sing my heart out and get to hang out with some of my fellow eastsiders, friends, people that i've known for years. Danced with that cute Karaoke guy Scott a couple times *drools* and got to meet some really cool new people, ogle some hot boys, just have a really good time. It reminds me of the good old days when I had just turned 18. Me and my friend April went to the bar 7 nights a week to do karaoke and it was between Arts and Ragtop every night with our favorite Karaoke Host, CK. Ya ever notice how most karaoke guys (not the ladies) are either very preppy or very country- even CK wears like, the nice dress shirts and the nice pants... and he's bout as down to earth and eastsider as they come LOL. I love him tho. I go to JW's too, but considering my panic attack the other day, I prolly wont go there much lmao. Oh- my cheeks hurt from laughing and smiling so much... there is something to be said about being able to just have a good time with no fights, no shootings, no arguments- nothing at the bar. Most places, there is at least one. The last couple weeks goin to my favorite neighborhood bar, there hasnt even been a skirmish that couldnt be resolved before I knew about it.

      I noticed I use the word okay waaay too much. So we went out last night, me and a friend- to sing karaoke, but the basketball game was on so we couldnt miss that too. So we go to one of my old favorite spots, JW's. I'm all nervous and stuff 'cause I've never gone out with this particular friend- it always messes up my nerves meeing or going out with new people. I did it on Thanksgiving and I got really extremely drunk.... not a good idea. I went with my friend Tina- and of course, being nervous makes ya drink- but when you're with a bunch of ppl who drink too, you drink even more. We went bowling and the drunker I got the better I bowled, but I got waaaaay too drunk and puked before I passed out. Of course, Ms. Tina took pictures of me in my drunken stoopor and I have to be careful that she doesnt release those photos LOL. Anyway, so we get there and immediately the karaoke guy nods and tells me to let him know when I'm ready... Starts hoverin around my table a little bit too. So, I'm tryin to look for a song, I'm already nervous 'cause it's the first time me and Brandon (if yer gonna get pissy when I use yer name, then that's too bad... with all the ppl I know, nobody's likely to know it was you I was talkin bout anyway) OMG this girl sang "But I Do Love You" by Leann Rimes last night.... good song. Anyway (have ya noticed my mind is goin 10 directions yet?)it's the first time me and him have gone out anywhere to hang out so I"m already feelin like I'm just gonna throw up and all nervous. Joel, this guy from my math class walks past me and my whole brain just froze. I freaked out for reasons that are waaaay beyond me even now. It took me half an hour to find a song and I couldnt stop smiling- the game is going just awesome and  I'm gettin a buzz from the alcohol.... it was madness. So I'm like trying to calm down thinkin I'm gonna laugh myself off the stage and this guy gets up and does "Man of Constant Sorrow" and he sounds really pitiful- not bad, just like he's pitiful himself and I couldnt help it. I just had it- was cracking up the whole time he's singin. So I finally get up there, and I'm just slammin this song big time and I come back to sit down and Brandon tells me the pistons are up by 14 WOOT WOOT. So we're singin and havin a good time and I cannot keep the smile off my face all night 'cause we're laughin and hangin out and it's the most awesome thing. Some guy sang the song that they play on Monday Night Football (like the actual song- All my Rowdy Friends are Comin Over Tonight) and some song reminded me of Schoolhouse Rock- do you remember that show? Some guy told me I was like in my 30's just because I knew some of the stuff on it. WTF? Who didnt see SchoolHouse Rock??? Ya know, when you were little, Saturday Morning cartoons were the only thing you lived for. Now they got a bunch of nonsense on there on Saturday. I miss the good old days. The good old days of anything- do you remember when chat was chat?? No bots, no assholes startin shit- maybe occaisionally but not on a frequent basis. No booters, no teenyboppers in the rooms all the time- of course, we made user rooms then too. We didnt stay and close the bar so I went to my neighborhood bar- Jans. Oy my friend Dan punched me in the arm- (of course I punched him like 10 times first) it did not feel nice. Didnt hurt too much but it didnt feel good either. Perfect example of why hangin out with guys is cool. You can be one of the guys and not worry about them tryin to molest ya all the time hehe... gotta go. Laters

      So, I'm sitting here yesterday and my roomie calls... Let's go to tha casino. Okay, I've been doing pretty good- working, going to school... everythings just peachy... and then the guys come in. Why oh why is it everytime I decide to just say "forget romance right now, I can do better by myself," a slew of just awesome guys comes along? I mean, yeah, I have a lotta guy friends, and they're wonderful, but it's like they are standing out more than the others right about now. I totally believe that it is possible for men and women to be strictly platonic friends, but most people dont... so that leads me to wonder if I should believe it or not. But, I have plenty of guy friends that I'm strictly platonic with. But what if things start to change? I've been havin little birdies in my ear lately tellin me some of my guy friends are cute- more than once they've said so. One of them I know there's no chance in hell that we'd ever even look at each other that way- but what if we did? Would I sleep with him or try a relationship? I dont think so. I would never want to ruin a perfectly good friendship. So now what? I dont know if I want to settle down yet. I do, but with guys acting like they are smoking rocks nowadays, I dont want to risk finding a total nutcase and trying to be his woman, 'cause once I love you, I love you- period. NO if ands or buts about it. I love unconditionally- and i know this may be starting a whole new onslaught of guys trying to win me over, but I am smart enough to know better. You may think you're smarter than me, but I've heard every line there is. It's hard to find someone that will treat me the way I want to treat someone else. I spoil myself because nobody spoils me... I know what I'm worth and I get told so everyday, if you dont agree with me. I'm a good girl, not into cheating, not into sharing my man with someone else, and I try to keep the utmost trust in my man, but with the way things have gone so far, it's hard to do that. I will trust him until he gives me a reason not to. So why am I frustrated? Why dont I want to settle down? You know how it feels when your heart gets broken... You feel like there's a lead weight on your heart making it hurt and making it hard to breathe. I'm tired of crying over a relationship that is going nowhere and I'm tired of being treated like a slave, piece of meat, "the other woman" whatever... For those who are rolling their eyes right now saying "whatever" you put yourself in my shoes. To love someone completely and without any prejudice is a strong kind of love to have- and I dont know how to love any other way. You hurt me, I love you. You cheat, I still love you. You hate me, I still love you and will cry 'cause you said you hated me, but I still love you. And then, comes the final, "it's not going to work out" and here I am, heartbroken all over again feeling like I'm having a heart attack. Or, the guy turns out to be totally crazy thinking he can order me around and when he says jump, I'm gonna say how high? No matter how much I love them, I cannot let someone control me like that 'cause you think they'd let me control them like that? I doubt it. I've spent my whole life learning the right kind of woman to be, caring, honest, and totally devoted- learned not to nag or cause scenes. I tell ya what tho, I really wanted to once. A guy I was seeing (not dating- there is a difference... if you sleep with someone you're "seeing" them) took me out to dinner once. My grandma had just died and I had just burried her on Wednesday. This is Friday, and he's just going on and on about "what if I just keeled over right now?" WTF?? Dood, my grandma just died and you want to talk to me about dying? Total head fuck is what it was. Pissed me off to the point where I lost my appetite and to fuel the fire he says, "what's the matter, you dont look happy over there" with a big grin on his face. I wanted to stab him in the face with my fork and scream, SHUT UP YA ASS! but I just kept my thoughts to myself and held my tears back. When I finally did bitch about it, it was in a letter because I dont like arguing and he informed me that he had nothing to apologize for. And I'm supposed to want to settle down with a guy- one that could possibly as insensitive as that? I dont think so. I wouldnt call myself picky- just smart. You know you're doing your job if your parents and older brothers never worry about who you're dating. Above all, liars take the cake. Dont tell me you're in school and just fail to have even a single schoolbook in your house- that's a blatant lie. Dont claim to be something you're not. Fellas, I'm telling you this so you know, the lies you use on other girls, dont work on all girls. You better try telling the truth a whole lot if you want to obtain a girl that's worth your time. She should be your best friend, someone you'd trust with your life. I know a lot of you either have a. had a crazy bitch fuck you up and scar you emotionally, or b. never been in love and are scared to death of it. Dont limit yourself to being a manwhore for the rest of your life. Strive for something more, or you're no better then those crazy slutty girls you been messin with. And you're definitely no better than the one who hurt you. I gotta close for today :D.

      So I'm at work... rather early today, and I'm wondering what I have been thinking. Instead of being all pissy at guys and talking about them and making them look bad, I should be that woman who highlights their good points. I could talk about a lotta good points for my guy friends, and about guys I hate right now (and believe me, I hate a lotta them right now) so I guess I will apologize first. I'm sorry, Don, paul- whoever you are... I'll just call u Don Pablo today :D for bein that bitch to rat you out. I'm sorry Harrold, for ruining something, but I'm not sorry for busting you out because she is a good friend of mine you sleaze. I'm sorry Jay, for being a bitch all the time... I know I am one and you cant convince me otherwise. Okay... I have this friend... he's pretty nice and he looks good- my roomies wont stop talking about him, but what do you do when things are strictly platonic and you have no interest in making them different? I have had crushes on my friends lots of times, but I eventually get over it. Most of the time I dont even tell them because I would rather have them as a friend than ruin a friendship. I've done it too many times already. I had to find out the hard way that one of my guy friends is nothing but a perv and he wants nothing but a piece of ass- and that's why he was being so nice to me. How did I know? He freaked out the minute I told him I seriously liked him and has been acting crazy since. I guess... I'm just like, scared of the rejection that follows an announcement like that. Right now I cant even begin to want to be in a relationship because I still love somebody and he doesnt and will never feel the same. I should get over it, right? That takes a long time. I'm not really ready to give it up yet, y'know? It's like, I spend my whole life trying to be this wonderful person. I apologize to Shimron, because I bit his head off for telling me I was dependent. I am very independent, but I depend on that male companionship to keep my life sane. I'd rather have it in the form of a friend than nothing at all... I guess it's a bit of growing up on my part that I've learned to accept things for the way they truly are. I dont approach guys anymore because I dont think i'm the hottest pancake on the stove and I definitely have good self-esteem, but I'm very realistic. I've been shot down before and we all know how that feels. Not very good at all. I'm cute... but not cute enough to be concieted, therefore I let guys approach me and by the looks of the guys that do, I must not be very cute to them. And the shit they say is downright insulting sometimes, but I try really hard to have patience and just smile and say hi to em. I got a test in like, half an hour. I'm out.

      Another lonely day goes by... *sigh* this is the first time I've been completely single in a looooooooooooooooooong time... no boyfriend, no buddies, no like, really close guy friends- just me. It kinda sucks 'cause I'm used to the companionship with a member of the opposite sex. I guess I'm one of those rare people that knows how to separate friendship from love, but if you try to mix the two, it wont even work.... I wrote a poem about the way I was feeling and everybody seemed to like it so here it goes :  April 27.2004  Foolish Heart    I can’t pretend this is the first time  & you know damn well it’s not,  I learn to depend only on me  ‘cause myself is all I’ve got  Don’t act like you don’t know  What this is all about  I’ve become so used to this pain  I don’t know how I live without  This pain feels like the knife  You slid into my back  & every night of sleep I’ve lost  Trying not to react  My chest goes numb every time  I force myself not to cry  & that only happens every night  When I’m alone & can’t help but wonder why  I can’t pretend it’s okay anymore  To be so sad I can’t move on  Tomorrow when I open my eyes  I’ll wish that you were gone  But you’ll always be around to twist  That knife into this heart of mine  U that’s how I know you have no soul;  No feeling, no heart, no spine  You’ve never felt pain so deep  It clouds your mind so you can’t see  Or you’d never feel good about this pain  That you daily inflict on me.  That about describes my pain right now. I'm not all about man bashing all the time. I can be your best friend or your worst enemy- you take your pick.

      I feel responsible when it comes to busting out guys who have that chovanistic attitude that women are not as smart as they are. Some feel like they are totally wonderful cheaters and that they just cannot be caught... well, this one is for you. I dont know what it is about me that makes guys feel like they just need to try to put me down or make me think I'm inferior to other women just because I'm overweight, but you need to really get over yourselves. That Alicia Keys song, "A Woman's Worth" says it all I seriously think. I dont know what makes you think that I'm a pushover, but I'm not. I've been around for a while and I know what's goin on. More than that, I'm well loved... I cannot find an ex that will sit in my face and call me a b***h or anything else derogatory so, what makes you think I'm going to take it from you. For the first time in 10 years I am single now- completely single, and I just dont think you guys understand what that means for you:: I dont put up with no stuff. I dont have to. I do feel kinda empty sometimes because I'm by myself now, but that doesn't mean I feel desperate enough to wanna be with you just because you are nice to me or wanna ask me to sleep with you right away. Case in point: Raphael- this is for you. A guy pm'ed me and right away I told him (like I tell everybody else) that I am not looking for sex on the internet nor a man, so whatever he was looking for he wasnt gonna find it with me. Within a week, he wanted to "marry me" and he felt that if we slept together that we should be together. That's all cool, but then when it became an issue of us sleeping together right away- that became a problem. Fool, I dont know you, I dont know where you've been, what you've been doing- or even if you're lying to me about who you are, hence the reason for me saying I'M NOT LOOKIN FOR ANYTHING ON THE INTERNET. And if I ever doubted that guys lie on the internet- Don, Paul, whoever the hell you are- this one is for you. I met this guy online and he seemed pretty cool, but me being busy all the time- I dont call people... I'd prefer them to call me so I'm not making an ass of myself calling them if they dont want me to or if they're busy. Well this guy does tattoos and he seemed like a decent guy... until he actually did start calling me. Okay this guy is big just like me, but he's a guy. I'm a girl... guys stalk girls just on sheer boredom. Women aren't that tricky unless you happen to meet some crazies, but still... it's not a reason to 1-give somebody a fake name, 2-try to ask for a piece of ass while telling a woman that you dont need a piece of ass from her (and if you say you didnt ask for a piece of ass, I dont know anybody else that would rent a hotel room just to go smoke ya idiot) 'cause you can get it elsewhere. And then the mother of all mistakes- you WORK in the same city I live in so it's safe to say since I've been here 23 years now that I am bound to know somebody you know. The degrees of separation for me are about 2 in Flint, versus the whole 6 that you're supposed to have for the whole world. I know somebody who knows you, dummy so if you live here, dont try to lie to me. Then hangin out with a friend who happens to have worked with this Paul/Don person, I find out not only are THOSE names not his name, he is apparently married. If I doubted that it was him that this person knew, they described him, told me what tattoo place he worked at and everything. Not cool, old man, not cool. As for Rafy- when I made it clear that I wouldnt sleep with him, he called me a b***h and accused my BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WORLD of saying the same and that I was crazy and that's why I'd never have a man. Anybody who knows me knows better- including my exes, so to spit out a blatant lie like that is just plain stupid on your part buddy. And you men wonder why I'm so evil all the time and I dont wanna talk to you... I've heard every line there possibly is and when you try to come at me with one I'm over here laughin my head off 'cause you dont realize I'm smarter than you think I am. There are some really nice guys out there but it seems like they dont ever wanna bother with me until they get screwed over by somebody else then they wanna screw me over too... how nice is that? Sometimes I wonder if people have any sense. I'm gonna get a shirt made that says "Common F**king Sense, Use it :|" But until then, this blog will suffice :D

      Well, this year so far has been pretty decent. I dont have very many complaints... I'm at a slumber party for one of my goddaughters and I'm waiting for kids to fall asleep. So I guess I'll tell you what I'm about. I'm # 6 of 7 kids... Me and my little brother are the only two without kids. My mom is deaf and my dad is disabled (sorta) he has one leg.... he's also a Vietnam Veteran. My mom was his second wife and they got divorced when I was 8... he got remarried right before my 14th birthday and even though we've had our fights, she's an awesome stepmom. I really dont have many good relationships to look at so it's safe to say that I havent had a really really good relationship. I try to be the best girlfriend I can be but it doesnt work. I try to be the best friend I can be and I can honestly say I only have two best friends in the whole wide world. Tencia and Rich- Giunta, not any other Rich I know. IF you're angry that you're not on that short list, I'll tell you why you're not. A lot of people just dont get me, or they depend on me to be there and they take me for granted. A lot of people smile in my face and I relly think they hate me... I'm still nice because I love everybody and I have this thing called unconditional love... It's a blessing and a curse. I love people so much that no matter how bad they treat me, I still care and I still do things for them and I dont like to see them suffer. I have so much compassion for others. Once I love somebody, that's it. I get taken advantage of a lot, and people make me cry a lot. My pet peeves? I hate it when I make or try to make plans with someone and they either dont follow through or they blow me off. I have an excellent sense of intuition... I know when a relationship with someone (whatever it may be) changes... if you think I dont know that you dont really want to be my friend anymore- you are dead wrong. I always know... that's the purpose in me being so open and so friendly... so that I know when you're not and I know when you start to feel differently about me. I hate people that lie or cant manage to tell me the WHOLE truth too. If you need to tell me something, just spit it out... dont act "funny" and yes, somebody was and I would bust them out, but I dont want to hurt anybody's feelings. I will tell you the most insane thing that's ever happened to me tho. I'm a chatter, true and true. I have been on this man bashing streak for almost a year and with reason. I had this friend, Jim. He was a decent guy or so I thought. He's old enough to be my dad, but I have quite a few older friends so I didnt think of him romantically. Well, he needed someone to "clean his house" was what he said, but he meant something else apparently 'cause the 2nd time I'd ever been to his house we were having drinks and watchin a movie and we were hugged up together on the couch. I dont consider that flirting 'cause I lay on the couch with my guy friends a lot- that doesnt mean I wanna sleep with em. Anyway, all of a sudden, BAM! he's got his tongue down my throat and he's almost on top of me! I was so shocked, I just kinda went with the flow and things progressed way out of control. The sad part? He took me home and never spoke to me again- like I did something to him. Normally I wouldnt even go this route and talk about something like this because I dont like to bust people out like that 'cause I care about them even if they dont care about me- but this is a perfect example of WHY I dont like guys right now. I could write for days about my one friend Jay... he seems to think he's the good Lord's gift to women and that I should be greatful that he even wants to sleep with me most days... *shakes her head* I dont know who's been lying to him, but he needs to find better friends. He makes a whole other pet peeve just by himself: concietedness is NOT a virtue and I wish he would learn that. We could be good friends if he would. I hate to break his little heart, but he isn't as great as he thinks he is. I love him... and that's what fucks up our whole friendship. I cant let him go and he is set in his ways. I've come to the conclusion though that I just dont have the patience to try to take care of a grown man the way I would do a kid, so I probably will not find the one. So, if I never get married, I'm going to finish school, get a good teaching job or get into educational policy, and adopt 3 or 4 kids. :D if I get married, I cant have kids so it'll pretty much be the same ordeal. I'm gonna go for now. Laters folks.

      I'd post the link for Shimron & Kathy's wedding blog, but that's a little too wierd. How'd&nbsp;I stumble upon that?? I somehow dont have his blog on my recent list anymore so I looked it up by the only thing I could remember- tramski. And sure enough, there was the wedding blog. I almost couldnt believe my eyes... so I checked it out. The wedding looks like it's going to be awesome. And then I saw the link for Shimron's blog, so I checked it out for real this time.&nbsp; I hate to be critical of him, so dont think that's what I'm tryin to do. I just noticed a lot of things have changed in him, and I didnt want to comment on it until my best friend saw it too. I'm not alone on this. It's like he's turned into that old man that I hate. Dont get me wrong, there is definitely something about a guy that is settled into his ways, but he seems to be going through the same problems I'm going through- drinking a lot, being confused, dissatisfied with life... But he's working on fixing it and so am I. The only thing I will say is loving someone and being in love with someone definitely are not the same thing.&nbsp; *shrugs* I am just happy that he is doing well and that life is going great so far. Although, unless there's some things I dont know about... there is a big fat lie now that stands in the way of our friendship that I'm not really too happy about, but what can I say? I love him so I'll let it go eventually- probably by the time he gets back from his honeymoon. Last year I told him I wanted to meet the person he was spending the rest of his life with before the wedding- and by summertime he was telling me that they broke up and he was moving to Colorado... okay. Maybe he felt he needed a break from me, but I really think it was for me do discover I needed a break from him. He is my best friend, and I love him dearly, still in love with him (although I'm working on that), but he drains me. I know that I do things I shouldnt, but never when it comes to him. I could tell you some stories that would have you wondering what the fuck he's doing getting married right now, but that stuff is in the past, and maybe he's changed. But at this point and time, I dont know so I cant say. Love is strange. Like the quote says, "dont marry the person you can live with, marry the person you cant live without." Well, I cant live without him, but he's marrying somebody else. I can be happy with the fact that someone loves him the way I do and that he will be taken care of for the rest of his life. I've noticed that he and I, no matter how much we try to not be around each other, no matter what breaks we take from each other- we end up right back on speaking terms, talking on a regular basis. Maybe one day he can be one of the well-wishers at my wedding. :) who knows? All I know is, he is definitely different. Now I guess I can really move on, seeing all the preparations and things they went through to get ready for the wedding. It still really bothers me that he's not comfortable with me asking how his relationship is going, since I tell him all about what I'm doing and who I'm seeing and if he asked to meet my boyfriends Id let him. *shrugs* Maybe he'll grow out of his insecurities, or maybe she doesnt know about me. Who knows? My situation? I havent heard from David yet, but in the meanwhile, I got asked to do some double/blind date in a couple weeks with Tim and Monya and some guy from Toronto. Great. Tonight: Rev. Righttime and the first cousins of funk at the Clubhouse here in Flint! Join us!

That information is confidential- only my man got the answer to that question because let's face it, he's about the only person that will ever let me do that... ya might say ya will, but I've tried to do it before and it aint happenin. 31. um, I dont think I've done anything especially kinky... besides sleeping with a married couple. 32. yes 33. no 34. you know I have 35. Depends on who the woman was. 36. very 37. Fetishes- being dominated, tattoos and piercings (I'm eventually getting my hood done) and smell good stuff- incense, perfume, cologne, candles... anything that smells good is a turn on. 38. What's the kinkiest thing you wanna do- umm.. sex at work maybe.

      Namely it isnt for me. This morning I was shown once again why these stupid ppl should not have children *rolls her eyes*. Someone I considered a close friend chose to think with his dick instead of thinking with his brain- which must not be very smart at all if it would let him choose to think with his other organ. So now I have to deal with his woman and then becase she is an attention whore who likes to start drama, I have to deal with him when I try to shut her up. And he chose to listen to her side of the story instead of everybody else, so now I have to be labeled a bitch in his eyes and I'm the one tryin to "start shit." Nice. Anyhew, four more days till the wedding that I wish I could go see, but it wouldnt be a good idea. I could just see him trying to explain why I'm there. OH and let us not forget about David. David and I have been friends for 4 years and for some reason, everybody thinks its a bad idea that I try to date him. He's been in prison the last 2 years and was in and out of jail before that. He had an idiot for a girlfriend- who liked to thrive on drama and making up stories about people to make herself look good. If a guy said hi to her, he was tryin to "holla at her" so it was pointless to take her anywhere with me. I met&nbsp;David when I was 19. I saw him around a lot, but he worked and I worked, so we never spoke or hung out. Well a friend of mine made it known that I liked him. He came over one day and this drunk guy was at my house- I was trying to go to sleep but I couldnt with that guy there. I asked my friend Chrissy to take him home, she said no, so I looked at David and he said yes. Something kinda clicked then.&nbsp;He asked me to come&nbsp;see him at work and we all ended up at his house.&nbsp;We all were partying- stayed at his house&nbsp;that weekend (he wouldnt let me leave) and I had no idea he had a gf because she never called or came over. Things happened, but unfortunately were interrupted. Well, a couple days later he went to jail and I found out about Jill. I wrote him and told him that it couldnt happen again because I dont help people cheat... I'm not one for that. So we have been friends ever since. I write him when he's in jail, and I kept my distance when he was out because I didnt want to do anything to cause problems with him and his girlfriend. He respected that. I finally met her because I was calling her for him and somebody told her that he and I planned on sleeping together when he got out. People that didnt even know me at that. So I meet her, go to meet the people who are telling her all this, and these girls are girls who both slept with my cousin. The one immediately decides better of talking about me and when I let the other one know who I was, she decides the same. Jill and I kinda became friends- until I realized how silly this girl is. She thinks that because she's from Grand Blanc she's so wonderful and smart and pretty and it just is not&nbsp; true. Her attitude makes her the ugliest girl I've ever seen (and I should know- I like girls).&nbsp;She started giving me a headache everytime I hung out with her 'cause her attitude was just blah. She started telling me all the stuff David has done to her and how he's cheated on her and stuff. For someone to be dumb enough to stay with somebody if they treat them bad- no matter how much they claim to love you, it's still dumb. The more I got to know her, the more I understood why he treated her bad. Well then I started seeing how she was. She's&nbsp;a slut- a nasty one at that. Doesnt like to use protection, sleeps with guys that you can just tell sleep with skanks, its no wonder she's with David- not to even be mean because he isnt the same as he was back then. She started telling me lie after lie after lie- you dont drive over to somebody's house the day you have surgery, no matter how minor it is. She started to irritate me the day she tried to tell me my own brother wanted her : yeah, right. He said she looked like a raccoon and he'd never do anything with her. I believe him- he doesnt have to lie to me, he's my brother. At that point, David was in jail again getting ready to go to prison... And I am here, seeing all the crap his girlfriend is putting him through. She told me she was pregnant (all of this while he was locked up- and I know for a fact that conjugal visits arent allowed AND that they are NOT married) then she had a miscarriage at like 5 months. Then she told me they got married, celebrated with a conjugal visit, and she got pregnant but she didnt know if it was his. Now she has these pictures of this kid that she says is his but all this time she doesnt know that I've been writing him and that he tells me everything. So I listen to lie after lie after lie- eventually she tells me he's out too and that they're having another baby. *rolls her eyes* stupid girls make me wanna puke on em. In the meanwhile I am still writing David and keeping him posted on his "girlfriend" and all her crap... In January he started asking about us... which was wierd. This year in January makes 4 years that I've known him. I dont know what changed, but in February he started asking about us and I told him that things could never progress because he was with Jill. Now,&nbsp;I"m really just confused as to why he's asking me about us since it seems he's still with Jill and still loves her or whatever. Well, I told him I hope I was still around and single when he finally ended up single. That moment has come quicker than I thought. He told me a couple weeks ago that he and Jill were breaking up- so I told him I'd be here for him when he got out. Now he tells me they are completely done, and asks me why I dont want to be with him. I know just by the fact that he's completely cut all ties from her that he's seriously thinking about what he wants to do and that it isnt drama. More than that, he knows me. He knows what I've gone through the past four years, he's been with me the whole time. He knows I'm not going to be down for any bullshit or drama, and I just told him what will happen if we leave the dating and being together option open. Once I love somebody, that's it. No if's ands or buts about it. So while I"m definitely not trying to be his girlfriend, if the situation presents itself.... who knows?

      I lied... I dont do it on purpose all the time. But I will admit when I've lied. Anyhew, so all this stuff happens within the span of one day- kinda makes me wonder what i did to deserve all this at once. Friday continues in the wierdness. I'm confused, wondering what I'm going to say to David, because I think we have the potential to be something really great- only because we have such an open and honest friendship and I know that if he put his mind to it, he could be the kind of person I want to be with. He's already half way there.... Just need some nudges in the right direction. Friday morning though, I get really, REALLY pissed when I think about the whole situation with Rodney and his new bitch. See, most ppl know that I hate chat drama... but they dont know why. I've been chatting since I was 16 or 17, met quite a few chatters even way back then. I started chatting really heavy at 19 and I met most of the regulars that I know now. When I let people into my life, they got ammunition. Ammunition for what? To hurt me... I actually had some guy tell me he was God, and that he was sorry for giving my dad a heart attack and he'd try to not let it happen again. I had no idea who this guy was, he wouldnt tell me, but that's what made me want to keep my private life to myself. I will tell stuff now that I dont care about, maybe even tell some good things that have happened- and since I made this blog, I tell it all, but, I've grown up a lot. My thoughts and ideas are my own, and if somebody doesnt like it? I really could care less anymore. Well, when I was in school, I didnt really get into drama either, but if I didnt like you, nobody liked you. Period. I was that girl that everybody knew, but I wasnt in any crowd. I made my own. I was popular by association, an outcast by way of life, and a nerd by birth. I was part of every group and a lot of ppl loved me. Very few hated me and I made sure to be nice to everyone because I am totally empathetic. I put myself in their shoes all the time and I wouldn't want to not be loved, so I make it a point to love everybody. That's just me. At the same time, if you piss me off, I know myself. I am a bitch, very sneaky and manipulative, and I will get you if you cross me. Paybacks are a bitch- paybacks from me are a 7 foot tall amazon bodybuilding bitch. So, I dont like getting involved with chat drama because I dont like that side of myself. I try hard not to get in any mishaps with people I dont particularly care for- and that isnt many people at all. But, when somebody deliberately tries to get me caught in some drama (I dont know if they want to make themselves look or feel good by acting like they either a-are a really close friend, or b-are somebody I'd drool over) The evil side of me comes out and takes over and there's nothing I can do to stop it anymore. I used to be able to just let stuff go, but lately, when I get mad I get really really angry. I guess maybe I've just had enough of people walking all over me, who knows. But I think I got it covered now. And the wierdest horoscope just happened to get sent to me yesterday. With all the stuff with David, I have been so confused. My horoscope kind of coincided with the situation and let me know what I should do- which was wierd. It hasnt been wrong yet so.... *shrugs* My horoscope for Friday, July 23, 2004: "They arent asking for all that much. Think how grateful they will be if you go along." Wierd huh? Love, Me

      Yesterday from beginning to end was really just screwed up. It started when I got up and realized that guys are perverts and wrote the previous post. Then, I go into chat, and I say I'm gonna piss a bunch of guys off- which I did, and lo and behold, here comes this girl I dont even know. Her name is Sara. They call her Sara Lee. She says to me, "you're not gonna piss of Rod are you?" And the first thing that runs through my mind is, what the fuck is this girl talkin about.... I hadnt even talked to Rod in days, so I asked her why she would even say that to me.&nbsp;What she says next kinda wierded me out, which stopped me from getting mad immediately.&nbsp; "Well me and Rod are together now and I dont wanna deal with him when he's pissy and he's coming to see his daughter today....." yada yada yada. At that point I get even more confused cause he doesnt have kids. She THEN says, "oh he adopted my 9 month old daughter" and lets me know its the Rod that we both know. At this point, I am still confused as to WHY she decided to tell me all that information, so I wait to ask Rod what the fuck is going on. I asked him if there was anything new and he says not yet. Then I tell him I heard something interesting about him and all he says is "yeah I heard all about that." Like it was okay that his new bitch decided to just try to bust me out or some shit in the chat room. #1- I do NOT under any circumstances put up with chat drama. #2- I do NOT want Rodney nor have I ever wanted him. #3- Even if I did want Rodney, he is a chatter, and it has been proven that they are nasty whores who cant be trusted. I havent met one yet that doesnt lie, and if they havent lied to me yet (or in some cases they dont think they have) it might do them good to know that I remember EVERYTHING we talk about just so I can catch them in a lie. Like the one that my good friend Greg told just to make me happy. First it was, "I dont like sex all the time- barely ever," then it was "I have to have sex all the time." WTF dummy? Well since Rod didnt feel the need to explain to me why some bitch I dont know is telling me all this information about him (which happens to be a HUGE pet peeve of mine- I hate it when ppl try to tell me stuff about others... if they wanted me to know, they would fucking tell me themselves) I came to the conclusion that maybe he knew about it or he condoned it. In any case, why the fuck would he want some chick to tell me all their personal crap like that. Why would she see a reason to tell me, especially. Well since I"m not keeping any secrets here, I will let it be known that I did sleep with him- once and only once. Not something that I wished to repeat, nor did I ever plan on anything else with him. So now I'm pissed. Well in the meanwhile, I go home and get the most wonderful letter I've ever gotten in my life. My wonderful friend David has been around for 4 years but he was with someone. I didnt know about her when we met and we messed around once.. well he went to jail after that and I found out, so we didnt do it again but we stayed friends and kept in touch. I was the only friend that actually wrote him when he got locked up everytime, took the time out to find out where he was and keep in touch with him. Well he told me last week that he was breaking up with her and wanted to see me (not like, date, just see) and so I made him proposal. I'm not opposed to a fuck buddy- especially not one like him. That was the quickest I ever got a letter from him. What he said was even wierder. Totally ended it with Jill since I gave him an inch, and he wondered why I didnt want to be with him... I do but, like I'm gonna tell him, I dont wanna get my heart broke for the umpteenth time. I doubt it will happen though *winks*. To top it all off I got a sex application with my letter *blushes* and so I was all happy yesterday. Then, I got to watch my roommate squirm as not one, not two, not even three, but four guys she had been talking to or dating came in the bar last night, on top of a guy who was tryin to hit on her and another guy who was buying her drinks.... FUN :D I gotta go right now but this is a two parter- I will finish it on Monday! Love yas!

       For those of you who think that you've got it made with me... I just want to let you know now, if you actually read my blog before I posted this, and STILL felt that way, you're pretty stupid. If you think that after the total idiotic display you gave yesterday that I will still want to talk to you, maybe even be your girlfriend, you have got your head screwed on wrong... totally wrong. IF- 1. I've seen your penis on cam, 2. I've seen pictures of you naked, 3. we've discussed having sex (with the exception of one person and I will tell him who he is personally 'cause there was no pretenses with him), or&nbsp;4. you've tried to get me to come "see you" and we've just met, LET ME TELL YOU THAT IT AINT GONNA HAPPEN. I dont know what sick world you come from where all women are sluts and like to be treated as such, but just because you tell me you "dont do one night stands" or "if you sleep with me you have to be with me" does not mean that I'm going to be your woman OR sleep with you for that matter.&nbsp; You have got to be seriously fucked up in the head to think that I would ever degrade myself by doing that. OH, and for you guys out there that think that telling me how great you are in bed is going to get me to ask you for sex? Save you motherfucking breath. There is a limit to how concieted you can be and still remain on my good side. You know who you are, QUIT PUSHING THE ISSUE. I'm tired of hearing about how all these girls are chasing you and whatnot- my ex used to tell me that, tell me all about his "harem of girls"&nbsp;then practically beg me to come over and sleep with him. You know what I told  him?  GO ASK ONE OF YOUR HAREM GIRLS. If they're so hard up for sex that they need to beg you for it, why dont you tell them all about how great you are, 'cause I dont care to hear about it. There has never been, and will never be a guy that makes me want them that bad. NEVER. I dont get "sprung" so you're wasting your time trying to make me want you. I've had enough good boyfriends to far outweigh the bad, as well as guy friends that have been good to me. I know just how good I am at what I do, so I dont need to brag. If I do, it's only because you are and I'm sick of you thinking that you're the only one who's been labeled a "golden child," as a friend of mine put it. You wanna know what I'm looking for in a man? Someone who's honest. Who doesnt try to talk himself up to make himself look so much better than any other man. Show me you're something, I dont wanna hear it- especially if you're trying to not have that kind of relationship with me. My problem has been finding the nice guy after he's met the evil bitch that made him hate women or at least, not want to settle down with anybody. Then here I come, I open them up, and they go off and meet somebody else and settle down with them. I'm sick of being the go-between for your better outlook on life. I wont lie and say I'm not spoiled rotten by the guys that are around, but it's not because I use them either. It's because I'm a real woman, and I know my place, my role, whatever you want to call it. All you feminist jerkoffs that wanna bash me? I'm not saying that I'm submissive in my relationships, only that I know from experience and observation how not to be. I've never been hit, never been mistreated (besides some verbal and mental stuff, but I can handle that far better than being hit), and I get told on a daily basis how much I am loved, how wonderful I am, and how beautiful I am. All you people that think otherwise, or wanna play games with me, you dont bother me. I dont need your approval or you to want me to feel like I am special. I know I am special, I know that there is no woman that is quite like me, for I am unique. I know I may put myself down, but that's me. The minute you begin to think that I have low self esteem and that I take your perverted and rude comments as a compliment is the minute I get a big laugh out of you. It aint happenin boys, if you dont like it, delete me off your list, tell me to delete you off mine and we'll be allllllllright, right? *big grin*

      Okay so now I have some good news and some bad news... Well, actually you already have the bad news. The good news? That's something I'm dealing with. First of all, thanx to my best friend 'cause she's about the only person that understands that particular situation from the previous post. While I'm sitting here debating what I want to do when school starts this fall (I have several options available to me), feeling down about the person I love most kinda being taken away from me (although I'm sure we'll always be friends and we may talk from time to time, it's only a&nbsp; matter  of time before that ends too) I get this letter from David. Who is David? I will tell you in just a second. Someone told my best friend ('cause she has a situation with her ex) something that I can really take to heart with my situation. Something they said to her just really struck me as good advice. "Dont marry the person you can live with, marry the person you cant live without." So on to the rest, David writes me and says that he and Jill are breaking up, and that he wants to come see me when he comes home. At this point and time, I'm single, not even talking to anybody seriously (while i am talking to a couple ppl, they arent serious, so I'm not going to pretend that they are) so I'm like, yeah. Made him an offer he cant refuse. He doesnt have to be my boyfriend, just my steady piece of a** and he can come and go as he pleases. I'm sure he wont want to stray far 'cause I've never had a boyfriend cheat on me and I'm awesome to date. Then I got these guys that think they are such hot shit trying to talk to me and they are just pathetic. I dont really date chatters, but there have been a few that I've been really infatuated with or liked, crushed on, or I like now. And since I spill the rest of my guts here, I might as well make it known. I used to have a crush on Brandon (irish_man somethin or other) and I used to like Gergy- but um, he lost cool points with me a long time ago. I have the major hots for Cooper, who has been kinda out of the picture for a long time, so I got over it. I did like this Timmay guy but then he let me know that what happens in chat (for him) stays in chat so I let it go. Let us not forget Mr. Jim, who did the ultimate hump-and-dump (even though&nbsp; we never even discussed dating or even sleeping together so him cramming his tongue down my throat was kinda traumatizing) and yes, that would be fishin_fool for those of you that do know. But now, I'm wondering how wrong is it for me to lust&nbsp;a man old enough to be my dad? *shrugs* beats me. I had a crush on D, aka shyguy_ak, but um, the more I get to know him, the more my crush floats away. It gets irritating when guys, instead of saying, I dont want to date YOU say, "I dont date chatters." or "I dont like to date my friends," in the case of Peter. *shakes her head* pete, pete, pete.... blah, blah, blah. Let us not forget that I crushed on S8N, but he did the same thing... "you live too far away" and then started seeing someone farther away from him than I am. What's funny about this all? I dont even seriously look at chatters as potential boyfriends- not ever. Unless they actually try to make an effort to see me or something, it's not happenin. Let us not forget the only two girls I've ever had any kind of crushes on, but once again I know it will never happen... Alyssa (pixxxie) and Tab. Yes yes yes, I know that this is probably a bad idea, but hey, why not tell it all if i'm tellin. I did like Kyle too- he's a newbie to me, but he's cute. It's not that I dont like him anymore, I just am realistic; if I cant have em, why dwell on em, right? I do like Mr. Travis too, but like the rest, it's something that will never happen unless some magic fairy comes along and douses me with magic dust or some shit. And then there is the just-like-a-movie-star likes, such as: e_dev eric, and any other extremely hot guy from chat that I've crushed on. The silly thing? Why is it that guys always wanna go for some really hot chick, or pretty much any other chat chick- except for me, and then they wanna know why I'm such a man-basher, why I refuse to date chatters. I am not going to bash the whole male poulation... I know that not all of them are bad, but if I cant even get my exes to bad mouth me, what makes these guys think I'm so horrible. I'm not most girls, as my ex told me yesterday. But apparently there is some tragic flaw about me that I cannot fix. I dont care anymore. After dealing with an asshole like Jay, all u guys can go suck a dick if you dont like me. I could give a shit less. All this sweet talkin to get in my bed? You are soooo wasting your breath and it is soooo pathetic. Like I've said before, and I will say it again, I know what I'm worth and I know that I'm an awesome person- I get told at least once every day. So when you think that you're in there, and that you have me right where you want me? Think again. I've had the live-in boyfriend once and only once. The only reason why he stuck around as long as he did is because he honest-to-goodness loved me. I'm not talking about saying it without action. He LOVED me. He tried to do everything he could for me- I was the one working full time, he was taking care of home for me. I'm talking back massages, foot rubs, telling me all the time he loved me. If he had been the type, I would have gotten love letters from him too. I know what a real man is like too, so dont think you're fooling me. I didnt mean to turn this into a man bashing, but you guys just make me sick. When I like somebody, they have to act like I'm sooooo horrible that they would never have anything to do with me- especially in front of others, then wanna talk to me on the sneak and try to get sex from me. And for you wierdos thinkin that I'm just gonna meet you sight-unseen and sleep with you? YOU HAVE A MENTAL DYSFUNCTION THAT I CANNOT SEEM TO GET THROUGH.... Since when do you think it is couth to ask a woman if you can fuck on the first date? Or to think that talking about sex constantly is sexy? It isnt. Keep your day job and learn how to be a gentleman, fellas.

      This week has given me a lot to think about and it's not even over. My last post before the angry side of me came out was talking about people I miss and the loves of my life. There's only been two- Karri is one and Shimron is the other- I'm sure he knows this by now. I wished that I could let it go, but until something worth my time comes along, I content myself with my feelings for him at least. Karri? I've met somebody that I could love more and she will never know because yes, I am a chicken shit, and no, I dont want to ruin our friendship by saying how I feel... It's happened too many times with other people. Like Jay, for example. Once I let it fly that I loved him, I might as well have said, "try to make me your slave" for all the good it did me. Apparently he feels that I should say how high when he says jump. Obviously that HASNT worked for him... nor has trying to convince me that he's the best sex I've ever had in my life :| (yeah, right). I'm sitting at home watching "I Love the 90's" anyway, and it's 1994 and all this stuff is just bringing the past to light for me... I was turning 14 and he was turning 16 (we have the same birthday- how he ever thinks I could forget is beyond me) and we met as friends. Like Jay used to tell me about he and I though, it was sympatico(?), or meant to be. Both middle children, both the kind of ignored children, the good children... Just not happy with life as we knew it at that point. Except, I was suicidal, and he kept everything in and gave himself ulcers. Writing was my outlet, I was his outlet (at the time). I dont know when I fell in love, but I fell hard, and I havent been able to get back up... Just when I think I'm ready to, the new guy messes up and he ends up getting compared to him and it's over. I seriously have held a knife to my wrist and watched my mother laugh at me when I was 12... And when I thought about it again and wrote it down, had my dad tell me he'd beat my ass... I'd never seen my dad so mad at me in his entire life as he was at that moment. I dont know if it was desperation that caused me to fall in love- I would say if it happened now yes... but then? It wasnt like now, when sex gets all tied in the way- it was something pure and sacred and there was no way you could call it anything other than what it was. What I felt for jay? I could call that lust because it was all about sex. But how can you say it about someone you've never slept with? I couldnt even do it now because it would ruin this little friendship we spent this long keeping in tact. No matter how long we stay away, we are like best friends and nothing can change that. It takes a whole lot of love to pine after somebody for four years... not really date or see anybody else... and when I did start seeing someone else, here comes Mr. "Let's start over" and that was the end of that. That had to be the worst breakup or whatever u want to call it of my life... I wont go into it 'cause I just may cry today. He is the start of a line of guys who swear I'm so wonderful that any guy would be lucky to have me... two of the four of them are married and he's going to be the 3rd. His wedding is two weeks and three days from now. I'm happy for him, dont get me wrong... I would never do anything to hurt him, but I think I'm starting to see how my dad felt. Till he met my stepmom (or at least, married her) he was miserable in his love life. She loves my dad so much, and it sucks that it took this long for them to be together, but if they had gotten together a long time ago, I wouldnt be here or I wouldnt be me. I can respect that woman because she loves my dad and she tries to be decent to us kids... not always, but she tries. I love her and I can call her mom now- when they got married you've never seen somebody cry so hard... I couldnt even stop myself from crying at the wedding as hard as I tried 'cause I knew I was loosing my dad the way he was with me. Shimron was the person willing to stand up to my dad and tell him that he needed to pay more attention to me and tell him about his daughter. That's when my dad decided he liked him, only after we had broken up. Here we are, years later, and every guy I want to date is compared to him only because he was it for me. We talked about marriage and kids way back then, and now, he tells me I'm too young, and for a long time, he said he wasnt getting married. Now he's the one getting married, and I'm the one saying I never will. Not that I plan to wait for him or anything- I just hold guys to that standard because it's not very often that a girl like me gets love letters, shown daily that she's loved, treated like she's the only thing that matters to someone in this world. I wont give in for anything less. There is a song that kinda depicts how I feel right now though... "Congratulations" by Vesta Williams. That song ran through my head so many times last night, I thought I would just die. Here's the lyrics:  Saw an old friend on the street, she said today's your wedding, My heart stopped, the tears dropped, Saw my whole life pass me by, I had to see you baby, I never ran so fast before, I rushed inside the chapel door, you were waiting all alone, You turned around and heard me call Congratulations, I thought it would have been me Standing there with you Congratulations, I hope you're happy 'cause as long as I can breathe, you'll always be the one for me Why was I the last to know, I thought that we were special, My soul shakes, my heart breaks, As I turn and walk away, I cant believe its over We really never said goodbye thought we'd give it one more try felt our love was here to stay, and now today's your wedding day Congratulations, I thought it would have been me, Standing here with you Congratulations I hope you're happy, 'cause as long as I can breathe you'll always be the one for me...

      Okay so this weekend was really crazy and I need to talk about it before I blow my top again :D. Friday was really cool- a lot of people came out to the bar ( and I will be putting pictures in my pics for yahoo, dont worry) It was really really packed and everybody had a good time. We went shopping Saturday so I could find some more hoochie-mama clothes- I got a new barbell with a french tickler on top *waggles her eyebrows* not that anybody's really gonna ever y'know.... We went shoppin Sunday for new bathing suits- I found a lime green and blue one that matches my barbell perfect. Um, we went to the lake Sunday too. but Saturday? My friend Dan finally came out to the bar and sure enough... dickhead Scott had to be a bitch. He flicked ashes on him (I hope it was an accident, but i"m almost sure it wasnt) was threatenin to beat him up, just bein plain wrong to him for no reason. It was pissin me off, so I got me a shot of tequila, went over and asked if I could punch him, and punched him for all the things he'd done. He said it didnt hurt, so he got slapped a couple times too. Told me I was violent Sunday morning. Sunday, we went to Jans, and of course Dan came out 'cause that's his bar that he hangs out at. My Monya friend met a new one and he's awesome. I really hope things work out... We all went to Angelo's where I had to get beat up by Dan :P just playin. Rae's boyfriend busted her eye open and so I got a phone call at about 3 from her letting me know- she got 11 stitches in her eye. Douglas Queen, you are sooo in trouble. He told me it was my responsibility when he beat her ass, well I guess that makes it my job to take care of him for putting his hands on her too, right? Well, yesterday was Monday. I told Lori I need someone to play cupid for me and she told me the guy for me was right in front of my face... talking about Dan. Someone else who's never even met him told me I was going to marry him. We're not like that and I dont have any kind of feelings like that for him, so what they're seeing that I dont is beyond me. I dont see it happening in a million years. Guys like that dont happen to girls like me. I might be cute to some of you, but as far as I know, I am definitely not hot enough to snag someone that looks good. I'm so glad right now that he wont see this 'cause he'd get all freaked out prolly.. NObody understands that I have alot of guy friends and we're strictly platonic. NOBODY. I gotta go to class. laters *hugs and kisses*

      Today is Friday. Yesterday I was feeling really good... up until my boss, who did nothing but check to see how much it was going to cost him to go get his master's, decided to try to make me look bad. Our sponsors paid $250 for an ad in a book and I'm waiting for him to come and approve it- then he wants to argue with me because I'm not going to clutter it up with a bunch of junk we dont need- just like the supplies that he asks me to order that we dont need, and the things he wants me to waste paper to print when we dont need them. I'm not one to waste anything- especially not money or supplies... and I definitely am not going to endorse something that looks hideous when I know people paid good money for it. So I'm arguing with him about this flyer, and here comes Jay- pming me just to say "hello" I didnt get to him till about 5 minutes later- and I know he didnt pm me unless he had a lil bit of time so when he didnt answer, I pm'ed him again. When he still didnt answer (as he's done so many times before) I snapped and told him not to pm me if he's gonna be like that. Well then he goes off on this spiel later that day saying "if you think I'm gonna wait all day for you to pm me back then you have problems" yada yada yada- said he wasnt waiting 30 minutes for me to pm him back and he wouldnt pm me anymore. Well this just was the last straw. I told him to suck a dick and to never speak to me again. I try and try and TRY to be his friend, I make all the effort- I go see him, I pm him, I keep the whole friendship going, 'cause if I didnt talk to him, you can guarantee he wouldnt talk to me unless he really wanted a piece of ass. We're not even friends anymore- so why am I bothering. Right at that moment, I felt lower than a speck of dirt on the ground and I'm wondering just what am I doing this for? Why do I beat myself up about it? Everything just overloaded my brain all at once, and I am feeling like, maybe it's me. Maybe it's a bad thing that I was born black- only because I like white guys- a LOT and I'm not really into black guys. I fell in love with one when I was 14 and I am still in love- whether he knows or cares is beyond me. I let myself love another one at 18, and he stuck a knife to my throat and then claimed to love me. I let myself love Jay and all he does is bring me down. So I am just mopey and tryin not to cry- here comes Scott, making it worse. See, we messed around, and he tells me a week later he just got out of a long relationship and he doesnt want to settle down, he just wants to be friends, etc... Well a week later he is all in love with my friend. He's white, she's white, things are kinda cut and dried. I know you cant help who you fall in love with, but when he is still hitting on me and touching me, it kinda puts a damper on my day. So he sees me all upset and is like, "Im your friend, I love you, I dont want to see you hurt, blah blah blah" and I'm getting more pissed by the minute 'cause I dont want him to touch me. So I'm fighting to cheer up just so he will leave me be and he's getting drunker and drunker- it's his birthday. Eventually he's walking around asking for birthday kisses- big ut oh. Yes I had to 'cause if I didnt, I'd look suspicious. So then finally it's the end of the night, and he's rubbing my back once again trying to comfort me when it kinda slips a lil too low to touch some skin. I'm in big trouble here tonight 'cause he's getting drunk already and I'm by myself- not by choice mind you. Did I forget to mention he blocks me at every turn? He doesnt like me talking to guys at all. So I"m stuck between a rock and a hard place. But on the other hand, I am meeting some really awesome guys (or so I thought till this morning *straight face*). I kinda like a few but it's not anything serious nor will it be- I'm staying away from any guy I meet online. Oy... maybe one day I'll meet a decent one, but I aint puttin out until they prove it to me. I gotta go. I'm done venting for the day :D

      On days like today I find myself missing Jay (yes I said jay, no matter how much he made me cry) just because we used to be such good friends before now. Right now I really feel like I need a shoulder to cry on or one of his awesome bear hugs and I know I cant because we ruined our friendship with sex. Because of it, our whole friendship has been reduced to whether or not I'm going to sleep with him. I'm no longer viewed as a friend, and I was always viewed as a girl, so I guess our friendship wasnt ever really a friendship at all. I always made all the effort to see him, and it was never reciprocated- so I guess he means more to me than I mean to him. It's a little late to get upset about it- I love him. Yes, I said the awful "love" word. I'm not scared to say it- even though most people are. Most people confuse love for lust, but not me. I've been in love- only once, but I have. So why do I need a shoulder to cry on? My home life sucks. I finally got some sleep this weekend, but before that I maybe got 48 hours sleep in two weeks, between the nightmares and stressing myself out over my roommate being stressed out. I was stressed so much I just now got my stomach to behave once in a while so I could eat a whole meal... I'm slowly becoming a drunk- only because there are things beyond my control that I cant help to feel hurt by. Like Friday, I knew something was coming that was going to hurt, but I just tried to stay out and have a good time. I'm in the middle of a song when I see this druggie that I know pregant for the umpteenth time. 8 months pregnant- and who knows who the daddy is or where he is, but I know she's not going to be able to keep the baby. My heart broke in a million pieces just looking at her. How can God allow somebody like that to keep having kids and not allow me to have any at all. I love kids, I've worked my whole life to support my brothers and all my older brother's kids, making sure those babies have what they needed and it breaks my heart when they miss me. I cant tell you how many other people's kids I've adoped as my nieces and nephews and how much it makes me cry when I dont see them. It already depresses me when I see all my friends having babies and starting families and knowing I cant, but the topping on the cake is when I see somebody like that, who will never straighten out her life, continuing to have kids. So to numb out the pain I decided to get drunk... even commandeered money from my brother Steve to drink even more- made sure I got myself completely plastered. Most people (including Jay) think there's no way I could miss him like I say I do- especially since I wont make any extra effort anymore, but how do you stay happy when you know that you're being used? I'm not even saying I want to be with him, even though he thinks I do. Maybe I shouldnt tell my whole life story here, but if I dont, how will anybody know me? Maybe I wouldnt miss him anywhere near as much if I had other distractions, but nobody distracts me enough. How can you be distracted from someone who makes you feel totally completely safe and comfortable. I never worry about anything around him. I worry about him, but not about myself. There is a song that perfectly depicts how I'm feeling called "I Miss My Friend" by Darryl Worley Maybe one day he'll hear it and see it's not about the physical feelings or me wanting to be with him (I could never do it anyway) It's about my friend. I miss you.

      When I was invited to join this blog I was asked to "don't post nothin too bad on here". I'll try to behave.  I’ve never been on a blog that wasn’t just another tech support forum. I’m not sure if this means I’m busy, studious or just boring. The safe guess is boring so I’m going with that. I have to admit that I haven’t read any of the post on here. I do a lot of reading online and I try to avoid any extra when I can but I promise to read all this useful and pertinent information soon. The only reason I’m posting anything is because I got the invite from shadow. I rarely get invited to anything (especially by the cool kids) so I just couldn’t resist.   Now that we’re done with the touchy-feely crap, let’s blog!  2004-07-03: Currently hanging with my extended family waiting for tonight. I’m in Chicago and on the drive over from Michigan I filled the car with class C explosives (fireworks to you lay people out there :). So tonight I will make every effort to put my eye out, set my clothes on fire or cause property damage. If it’s a good night I might do all three. I can only hope and try my best.  I’ve been traveling for a week and a half at this point and the work is piling up. A few 80-hour weeks after I get back should catch me up just fine. In fact I just finished working this morning and decided to use the remaining battery time on the laptop to make a post. Anyone who knows me knows I enjoy my work and spend most of my free time working. I work for myself, btw, so the extra billing hours are mine, not some fool I work for. As Dogbert once said “The American dream is to work hard and make your boss rich”. So work for yourself, be your own boss and take lots of vacations. Like this one.  You’ve been blogged. I’ll be back.

      My friend Bill sent me this... thought it'd be nice for you all to read :D THE LADY WITH THE WEAVE  I saw her from across the room My eyes swayed with jealousy This woman was so beautiful No one even noticed me  Her hair was long, dark and shiny Like the tail of a great prize horse Her personality, her confidence, her vibes, Just made the matters worse  The more I watched her as the night passed on I was convinced, she thought she was all that The way she swung her hair, round and round Side to side and front to back  Everyone was standing all around her, hugging her and shaking her hand. She had the attention of everyone, the servers, the guest and even my man  Finally, I couldn't take it anymore, I had to get a closer look I needed to get a view of this woman, with whose presence the room was overtook  So I did it, I ran up to her we collided she said excuse me are you OK She introduced her self, as serenity, I said hello my name is Shay  She said it is nice to meet you Shay I'll look forward to your prayer I wondered what she meant by all that I just wanted to check out her hair  As I got a little closer, my eyes could not believe All of this time I was going insane And all along this lady had a weave.  I'm all sweating and shaking, angry with my self Because she thought that she looked so good But now I see she doesn't compare to me Although I know she wish she could  Oh now I feel good I can leave what I thought behind Right at that moment a loud bell sounded she said gather around it is time  She took the mic from the podium, Mrs.  Grace, Ms.  Thang, Ms.  Fine She said thank you all for coming; tonight I appeared to be a great dancer. But as you know this is my going away party for I am rapidly dying of Cancer.  I want to thank God for keeping me full of praise, vibrant, healthy and strong For it is only through him that I walk with great joy for his love, mercy and grace has truly shown I've lost my hair, both of my breasts, and next I'll lose this life But I can hold my head up in confidence knowing that when I die I'll die knowing Jesus Christ  So I say to everyone here tonight no matter whom you are Your outer being will shine so bright When Jesus is your Morning Star I say to those who are struggling, no matter what you are going through With God in your life, his word in your heart, he will make your life brand new  I wept and cried all night how stupid of me to sum up this woman's life. She had to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Because If I were in her shoes.  I would have never shown up this night  Thought: Do not judge a book by it's cover, because between the pages are many untold stories that can not be read from the outside  Be blessed.......

      So I met someone new... who is with someone else, but it's like, a three way relationship kind of situation I'm walking into... with both eyes open at that. Well, it's something new for me. I've done the threesome thing more than once,  but never as a full out and out relationship. But, this kinda seems like it's right. I am just totally into these people... and no I wont use names just yet 'cause they arent here and it's not gonna happen anytime soon (like the next 2-3 months) so there's no need to jinx myself. Meanwhile I'm still in this dilemma over David. And I dont know what happened to my new friend, but he's been kinda m.i.a. so I wil just leave it at that. What's up with the title of this blog posting? I really wanna know how wrong this is for me. I feel like its right... and it's very rare that you meet two awesome people that you wanna be with at the same time. Have you ever had a friend that you never ever wanted that you all of a sudden discovered was kinda hot? Yeah I got a couple of those too. Then there's my situation that's gonna be some drama if I believe what I was told. This is why I dont date friends. Supposedly a friend of mine likes me, but someone else likes them, and they are my friend too... What to do, what to do? Beats me... so I'll just go with the flow and let it be. I'm learning more and more to do that. I'm sorry for making it sound like my ex is just a prude and he's really bland... but I got a whole lot more flava than he's got so, I cant help the truth. LMAO I told him no more bad mouthing him (although I dont consider it badmouthing- it's just the truth) so I'll stop. I"m making the dreaded trip to the doctors next week- I called and made the appointment today, 'cause Scott is bein a dork and has me all paranoid now. *sigh* even though I know I cant have kids, or rather, it's a very slim chance that i ever will, I am going to make sure 'cause there is no way in hell I will be able to explain THAT one away. It'd be a really fucked up Jerry Springer segment- "My baby daddy is my roommates boyfriend and he lives with us and we're one big happy family" yeah, right. Nice, huh? Well, now I'm going to definitely make sure that if I get preggo (which I doubt since I think David cant' have kids or maybe he lied to me  who knows) it will be a complete accident. *snickers* Anyhew, life is pretty damn amazing at this point. I am kinda glad I'm not in love anymore 'cause I"m discovering there's more out there if I will just open myself up to it. *shrugs* I'm discovering that while I'm the best counselor and the best relationship specialist when it comes to others, I'm totally clueless when it comes to myself. Somebody help me please? In other news, I'm totally uncontrollably depressed about my lack of children yet again. I'm 23 and it looks like I might not have kids... at least not at a time when I would want them. I wanna be able to just go thru my career and have my kids in school when I start it, but it's not going to happen. It totally depresses me... all my friends are having babies or have kids, and I'm watching all of them with so much envy it's enough to choke me. It almost makes me want to get checked for endometriosis, but even if I found out I had it, I'm not at a point in my life where kids would be feasable at all... so I'm going to keep on going and cry myself to sleep occaisionally because I feel this maternal instinct that I can do nothing about. I wish sometimes that God would just have mercy on me and let me have just one. I would be happy with that. Then I could adopt some of the kids that I see around here with fucked up moms. That hurts my feelings way more than not bein able to have kids- seein these crackwhores and alcoholics out here doing nothing but stayin knocked up to get assistance and then fuckin the baby's life all up by staying drunk or high the whole time. My roomie's boyfriend has two kids that he's trying to see, and their mom lost em because she was passed out drunk and they were runnin the roads at 2 years old. Nice huh... As if my life couldnt get any worse... I'm sitting here at work dealing with my boss yet again- he thinks if he yells at me for the shit he does, I wont fight back. He thought it was smart to tell me once again he expects me to multi-task as if I'm getting paid the 8 dollars an hour to be the receptionist.... If I were, I'd do that. But as it stands, I'm a work-study student and pretty soon I know he's going to know it. Even though it's going to kill me to not work thru the break, I think I just may find another work study job. I am not dealin with his crap for two more years just for the sake of working close to home and maybe I can get my old job back or something close to what I'm doing now. I'm definitely going to go check. This isnt working... that's what I'm going to do Monday morning as early as possible- while I'm going to pick up my books. And I'm going to get a copy of my actual job description and tape it to his computer highlighted so he can see exactly what my job description entails. He thinks his center should run differently just because he says so, well I will make sure even if I have to call his superiors and complain until they come fix it. *sigh* Another case of liking someone who is partially taken. You know how it feels when you get your heart broken... Like you cant breathe and someone has a lead weight on your chest and there's a lump there too. Sometimes if you sit there long enough feeling that way a sharp pain kind of gets you there and you cry... You play your sappy music and cry yourself to sleep that night wondering what the hell is so wrong with you that you have to be by yourself. In my case, what the hell is so wrong with me that I cant not only keep but find a boyfriend, why do I have to be by myself, there's something wrong with me, I cant have kids..... I'm pitiful, I know. I dont have low self-esteem, but my self pity is just more than I can take some days.  Check out the poem blog too you guys- it may have new poems on it next week.. Probably all my poems will be on it by the end of the week. Laters. I love yas! LEAVE A COMMENT DAMMIT!

      OKAY.... I have to elaborate on things from the last post BECAUSE SOMEBODY didnt like it... even though he didnt even try to comment on the post and tell me why he's not boring. Let me explain. Shimron will go on, be happy to live his life, settling for what's given to him, be happy with the house, the kids, the minivan, and he will continue to edit his life for television. Dont show any real anger or agression, dont work out the problems you have in your life- just be happy to live your humdrum life. There was once a time when you were passionate about the feelings you had for ppl and the way you felt about things. I'm not alone in thinking this way- ask Hortencia, she asked me what the fuck happened to the Shimron we knew. Beats me. I know we used to be a lot alike, and as we grew up we grew apart, but I never realized how much. My thoughts are better shown on paper. Just the fact that I have yet to meet the woman he loves so much, and we are really good friends he and I, kind of lets me know how much things have changed. All my other exes and I have pretty good friendships, and I've hung out with them and their wives, but I feel like I get cut off if I even ask about his (now) wife. *shrugs* I dont know if he thinks I want to start something or if I"m a part of his life he'd like to keep to himself, but it kind of hurts my feelings that I cant meet her. But that's him. My life just happens to not be so humdrum. I know that he's not boring because we like different things, but I refuse to settle just because it's the right thing to do. Some ppl are happy to do that, but I want what I want and that's it. I couldnt live the humdrum life with a husband, 2.3 kids, and a dog... it just doesnt go. Maybe you can, but that isnt something I look forward to. That's boring to me. Maybe it is that we just like different things, but hey, this is MY life story. :D

      It has taken me this long to figure it out. My best friend (aka the ex) edits his journal... and his life is really hum-drum... It's edited for TV. He's married now, and the wedding was beautiful... And I really do send them my congratulations because I want them to be happy. But, now I see the difference in him that I could never figure out. All I gots to say is, thank goodness my life is NOT edited for TV... there's just something extremely bland about that and I couldnt live my life that way. My parents arent happy with every decision I make, but they know I am old enough to know better and that usually I have good judgement. I just dont always have good judgement with guys... which tends to become a problem more often than not. Well life is all about trial and error- and I've decided I want to share my journey with everybody- no matter who it is. I have a few people that blessedly read my blog a lot- and it's not like I'm trying to spice it up to gain the interest of anybody- everybody tells me my life is like a soap opera anyways- instead of me repeating a story a million times, I'd rather tell it once.  So I heard about blogs from a couple friends and all of a sudden, here I am posting with the best of them. It makes me glad now that things never worked out with the ex. I could never be with him- I would die from the boredom. My life is exciting- a little too much drama at times, but I love it. I get to meet all kinds of people- and I'm about to force my way into a band some way somehow I swear. I like life on the party side, not on the normal side. My life has a lot of changes from day to day, so I never know what I'm going to be doing or who I'm going to be with. I dont know if I"m gonna be with dave... I dont know if I wanna pursue something with the person I'm kinda seeing... I just go with the flow now and it's killing me. But... there's always new things coming along and I'm happy in the life that I"m living, so I cant complain. I got to go see an awesome band last night at Jamies in Garden City- Ray Street Park. They totally rawked and they were sexy as hell- all of them. I went with Ryan, met up with Kristin and Megz, then met Bina, Beki, Christine (motor), Nina, Chrissy, Jessie, Gene, Kari, Fred, (I'm so bad at this so forgive me) and whoever else was there- dont let me forget Moo my fav buddy buddy. I had fun with all you guys that band rocks and we definitely have to do tha again. I will write on Monday about the rest ofthis weekend :D

       Here's what I sent Josephine for those that dont know already... me and my boss fight constantly and yes there WILL be a posting about that in a few days if I'm still working here :|    Juanita Johnson &lt;shadowspuzzle@yahoo.com&gt;   wrote:  Date: Wed, 4 Aug 2004 14:26:39 -0700 (PDT) From: Juanita Johnson   Subject: Issues With Ismael To: jblake@mcc.edu    Dear Josephine,   &nbsp;   I spoke with you earlier today about my concerns with my job and my actual duties, and per your request I am e-mailing you with them as well. I called you today after another argument with Ismael. I did ask him today if I needed to call you and ask you what my job duties were and he told me I didnt need to call you, that our center ran differently than yours and that we could work this out ourselves. I guess our main problem is when he tries to get me to do things that are unprofessional or things that I view as responsibilities that someone with more eduacation should be given. I am a smart person, true enough, but I dont feel that it is professional to ask someone to do things they dont know how to do- especially when it involves someone else who has asked for their help.   I started working here May 10, 2004, and my official title is a Computer Lab Aide and it is a workstudy job. I dont remember exactly what my duties list, but when I came here for my interview he did say that some of my job duties would be helping keeping the building clean, answering phones, helping people with minor computer problems, and helping monitor the activities that go on here. I did not sign up for what I've had to deal with the last three months. I kind of thought that I might have a little bit of a problem when he tried to get me to forge someone's signature on a thank-you letter he created for the Cinco De Mayo event that they had shortly before I came here. Most everything he has asked me to do I haven't had a problem doing, but I feel like I'm being taken for granted now and it's becoming extremely obvious to not only myself, but the people that frequent the technology center. I didnt mind opening and closing when he was ill, but there has been way too many times  when I have absolutely no warning if he is or isnt coming in, if he's leaving early, or if he's going to be late. I've had to open without warning, close without warning, and pretty much be here so that the center is open when he's not here. Myself and the other student worker, Toni have wet up our schedules so that one of us is here pretty much at all times incase Ismael is not here. I didnt mind being made responsible for the Newsletter, but at a meeting he told myself and Toni that there are grants that the center has recieved that have not had their requirements fufilled and told us that it was up to us to teach the various classes. A couple of those are the Web TV class and the Palm Pilot classes. I happen to be a part of this community and I've volunteered at the Eastside Community Center for six years, so when I told the former director about the classes he offered his time, free of charge, to teach the Web TV classes. When I went to Ismael about it, he told me no, and that  he wanted myself or Toni to teach those classes. Since I've never used Web TV, and I am a full time student with another place of employment, I thought it was pretty unfair to be expected to teach classes on top of what I already do here. I'm responsible for the newsletter, everytime somebody comes in for any of the programs or resources we have here, he directs them to me, whether I know what i"m doing or not. If I tell him I dont know how to do something, he expects me to just "figure it out" on my own without any help because he's busy. I've gone to ask him for help several times and found him looking up how much it's going to cost him to take his family on vacation or how much it's going to cost for him to take his masters degree program, and while I know I dont work as hard as I probably should, when something needs to be done, I've done it up until the last couple weeks. He takes on extra projects and hands them right over to me usually, like the certificates for the Financial  Literacy courses, the ad the American G.I. Forum purchased for the booklet for their convention, and some menus for a restaurant someone asked him to make. Several times we have bumped heads because he wants me to cut corners or be unprofessional in the things that I do. When we do argue, he asks me if I like my job, or tells me that maybe I shouldnt work here. I'm sorry, but I'm a part of this community and I do what I can to bring people into the center, but when the things people come here for arent even here, why would they come back? He tells people about the classes and never schedules them or expects us to teach them, so they just never get done. We have the key train software on all our computers now, but I dont know how to use it or anything, nor did he try to take the time out to show any of us how to do it, so if someone came in and asked about it, I wouldnt know what to say. If they did come in and ask about it, he would refer them to me, and because I think it's  unprofessional for me to try to teach someone something as I'm learning it, he gets offended. I'm not really good at resumes and someone came in asking for help on theirs today- this has to be the 3rd or 4th time he's done this- and he referred them to me. I told him I'm not really good at them, and he says, "well if you would take the time out to learn right now, it's really easy." Well, I feel since that person asked for his help, he should be the one helping them. A lot of people ask him to&nbsp;help them because they're not comfortable with a young person helping them and he always sends them my way. Very rarely does he come out of his office to help someone with something out front. I think that if someone comes in asking for help, someone qualified should be helping them, not a student who may or may not know what they are doing. I have some computer knowledge, but I feel that if I needed some help, I would want someone that knew exactly what they were doing as to not make any  mistakes. I dont think I would want someone teaching me something as they are learning it because it's a waste of my time. I'm sure most people feel the same way. Today, that was what the argument was. I told him that maybe I should call you and ask what my job description entailed, he told me no, asked me if I like my job, told me I wasnt a team player,&nbsp;and told me maybe I shouldnt be working here. This is always the way arguments go with him. Maybe he thinks he can threaten my job or something to keep me in line, but I dont do anything unprofessional when it comes to the work I turn out. And if he wants me to do that, we will argue everytime- and I"ve told him this on more than one occaision. There has been many times when I've wanted to call or e-mail someone in charge and let them know what's going on, but I was trying to keep a good relationship with my boss, but he has made it clear that if I dont do everything he asks me to do, he pretty much will do the same thing he  does everytime we dont see eye to eye. He will ask me if I like my job, tell me maybe I shouldnt work here, and hopefully I will say that I dont want to work here. The problem is, I love my job. I've actually taken the time out to get to know most of the kids that are here on a regular basis,&nbsp;I'd like to be involved in this center because I live right in the neighborhood, and I'm even here more than 25 hours usually because if I didnt stay some days, we'd close early. Too many times we've opened late or closed early because Ismael isnt here. I'm afraid that if I stay, we will continue to fight about petty things and then when I want to implement tutoring or mentorship programs here on my off time I wont be allowed to because he doesnt like that I argue with him. I dont want to outright call him lazy, but when the kids around here know that if I wasnt here to open, we wouldnt be open, I dont know what else to say. I'm sorry if this creates a problem, but I've held my tongue a  little too long I think. Thank you for your time and consideration of my problems.   &nbsp;   Sincerely   &nbsp;   Juanita Johnson      Do you Yahoo!?  New and Improved Yahoo! Mail  - 100MB free storage!

      So here I am, all giddy and nervous about the contest... and I'm all psyched about my lettter from David... I have a new friend that is totally awesome and I just love even talking to him- even though it kind of surprises me everytime he calls me 'cause I'm not used to guys doing what they said they would do. Things are pretty great. I have a couple new friends in my life that I'm happy for... um, one in particular (you know who you are) I um, had fun with you and I think maybe we should hang out again soon *winks*.... I think that this is the calmest week I've had in a long time... I dont even feel like really man bashing this week 'cause I've met some awesome guy friends lately and they rock. Now, bout the time I say this, one of them will drastially screw up and leave me to man bashing again. Allright the weekend... I was kinda out of it yesterday, jitters and all. Why is it that the wonderful, awesome, down to earth guys always like somebody that is going to use them? I have so many guy friends who are just totally awesome and they get with these girls - some of them KNOWING that they're gonna get used, and then wanna cry to me when it happens. Not all of yas cry to me- so dont take it personal. But I have soem really awesome guy friends- and I'd really like to hook them up with my female friends that I meet, but jeez... they are stuck on these bitches they know they cant have and then wonder why when I come around I wont date any of them. Sure... I wanna be with a manwhore. Not. Well then there's the whole issue of the ones that I see doing it and then I see the person they're with- or that girl is a friend of mine... once the shit turns sour, then they wanna try talkin to me. Now, I'm glad to be your friend, but I definitely do NOT wanna date you in that case. If I'm friends with the woman, then we just cant go there... It's not "couth" as my ex-hubby (I'll explain in a few) used to say. When was I married? I wasnt... Tony is this guy that I was totally infatuated with but never actually went out with. But, for all intents and purposes when we were at the bar, I was his "wife" as he said. Anyway, I never claimed to be gorgeous or anything like that, but i know I'm cute, I know I'm damn sexy and I know I'm a good woman and an excellent friend. What else do I need to know? Nothing. There isnt anything you can say to me that will make me feel any less about myself. I love being me and that's all there is to it :D I guess since I've decided to make this the story of my life- truly uncut I can say who it is I'm crushing on. My friend Tab. I know, I know... that's complicating things if she's the type to get all wierd about it, but hey, I like her. So what? That's the way I feel. As for my relationship situation? I never seem to just have one guy I'm interested in... when I get interested in one person, three more (at least) come out of nowhere and I have a dilemma on hand. I was looking for something to wear for Halloween... went to Hot Topic's website and found more than just something to wear- other things too. The link is down there for those that wanna see just what I'd buy if I shopped at Hot Topic- the dress on the bottom- maybe something like a vampire bride or something is what I'm thinkin... who knows? Right now, I'm enjoying all that is going on for me. I love ya all.  urlLink http://www.hottopic.com/wishlist/viewSomeonesWishList.asp?W=479802

      So Friday Jess came out and we were supposed to go see Reverend Rightime and the 1st cousins of funk- but they did a quick- change the plans kinda thing. So... we hung out at my bar (of course 'cause the drinks are cheap and the ppl are hillarious) and then we went to see Miss Katie at the titty bar :D Saturday was a good day too... went out to Brighton- got to spend time with some of my favorite friends, just hanging out. And then I got to go cook dinner at a friend's house- made some kickass lasagne for them, then I altered my mood a little bit and headed for the movies. Oh- let us not forget, the lady called about the karaoke contest- which is TODAY, so I'm all nervous about that. But it's 200 bucks in my hand. So we go to see Harrold and Kumar Go To White Castle's and i'm laughin my ass off. We get to the bar- Les's 21st birthday and so things are all crazy and out of control.... man it's just awesome. So I get home and there's a letter from my favorite jailbird... I dont know where this is going to go, but right now his ideas kinda rock... and we're good friends so things could be great if they ever went anywhere. Fuck the 4 page letter- it was six pages long. So by the time Sunday rolled around, and I got to sleep in waaay late which never happens for me, let me tell ya, I'm feeling just awesome. We cooked out and had ppl over and things were just wonderful. Then I got my horoscope- "Remember how hard things used to seem? Thank goodness that phase has passed." Then I got to hang out with TJ like he said we were gonna on top of that too.... And I couldnt even force myself to care about what was going on hundreds of miles away from me not even for one second. Actually, I'm over it... and I am glad that someone is happy and that I can move on and be happy too. :D Besides, my life is a little more interesting than his. I think that finding someone who loves me the way that he did will be that much easier because he's with someone now... I like that. And maybe I'll find someone who likes my lifestyle and lives it too... who knows? I guess I'll find out huh? Right now, life is seeming pretty great. Maybe I'm over it 'cause I still cant get upset now no matter how hard I try. I gotta go- write more later after class :D
