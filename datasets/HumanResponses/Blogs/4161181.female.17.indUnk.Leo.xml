      "Momo" here refers to a comic book character called 桃城 武 (not sure if I can type Chinese characters ga) anyway, it's a character in "the prince of tennis," which is my recent favorite cute, devoted to his club, and yeah,  GORGEOUS !!  and he reminds me of you Dunno why, the Momo guy's undoubtedly athletic and you are so... so... God I don't know how to describe my vocabulary's just too limited  I love you, really... and I miss you damn so much

      god what on earth am I doing right now waiting for your mail??  as if you cared  I know yeah I know you are never gonna answer me not because you are too busy but because I'm not even a pal  honestly I had a crush on another guy earlier this year even if the special feeling just completely faded away I'm still too shy to talk with him he isn't like you yeah isn't like you at all he's quite athletic but you are far too bright the only characteristic you two have in common is that you are both very gentle  you never meant to but you did hurt my feelings not because I'm too sentimental but because you are too gentle heartbreaking gentle and he sigh now I don't care the least bit I was just too lonely  I miss you so much I don't expect you to know actually I dare not let you know how much I cared about you  I still remember those dreams but now I can no longer realize them cause now I belong to another field worlds apart from yours  now I feel crying better stop typing

      and it's thundering outside somehow I feel extremely peaceful maybe sometimes I just prefer to be alone completely cast away from this hypocritical world  yeah it's a hypocritical world and in order to survive I just force myself to be pretentious somebody kept pulling my legs so I smiled while imaging strangling him with my own hands cruel? maybe  but definitely human  why are there so many rules and social values and what's so inappropriate to be a little different from others you accused me of instilling passive living concepts to those so-called "innocent ones" you'd rather say "ignorant ones" I guess sometimes I just can't figure out how things get through some people's brains yeah I just can't understand you said no man is an island but what if someone simply  choose to be an island...?

      hey you know what I've always been waiting for you for your attention for your coming back for your telling the  truth  but always miserably in vain  and here we go again you write to me and I read over and over again but hesitating to reply cause I hate the feeling of such endless waiting then after months I accidentally reply your mail cause I simply  miss you  so much then you got so busy that you cannot (or you don't want to?) spend  itsy-bitsy  five minutes to save me from the cursed pull-over god so  sad  I'm so  sad   before last summer vacation my life was a  mess  a dull mess and then you csme so gorgeous so gentle that I had a big big crush on you you came you went you left me in this tiny island so alone my infatuation for you still remained my life was still a mess but a more  chaotic  mess you came you went and  you never came back  you told me you would stop over during xmas holidays last year but such far-fetching promise you simpy failed to kept so  sad  god I'm so  sad  and I miss you damn so much

      Hey!  Have you got a clue?  Today's my 17th birthday, and I'm still waiting for you.  You said you  might   send me a birthday card  seems I shouln't have expected too much of you  Yeah we are merey penpals  I just tend to ignore all the rumors and I wonder if you do  Now in this foreign site, I finally I have the courage to tell you  I care about you...  yeah, I really really cared about you...

      Have seen the Robot movie Just as I've expected, a lot of fightings Will Smith kept venturing and recovering miraculously  Honestly if I were in that era I would never ever trust a machine especially with such frightening looks  Sarcastic enough technically I have teconology phobia and I tend to write down all of my feelings by computer!  Sometimes I'm just so pessimistic so cynical Just can't look on the bright side Today's my birthday and I still feel so miserable Somehow I'm afraid everything I cared I've been chasing for are only the preparations for a future that may not even exists
