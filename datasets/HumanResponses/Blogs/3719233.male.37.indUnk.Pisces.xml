      Well, I just finished reading the March 2004 J.C. Blog archive…  [*  wipes brow  *]  Boy-howdy, the onset of the Iraq War sure circumvented the nostalgic nature of the place, didn’t it? --- And yet, in reading it now, less than 48-hours after we turned the keys over to the interim government there… [*  shakes head in recognition (literally)  *] …I have to say that I am truly impressed with the degree of deep insight and suspicion that some of my old JC friends and acquaintances exhibited, even as early as the very first days of the war. --- And it’s also damned ironic that Michael Moore somehow managed to be a topical ‘go-to’ throughout that particular month-long run-on conversation, particularly in light of his most recent cinematic release (and most notably, the subject thereof!)   My sweetheart, Kathy, commented on something yesterday that I thought I’d mention:  Apparently, reading the J.C. Blog has been very therapeutic for me… hell, perhaps invigorating even… because Kathy noticed a certain enlivened shift in my overall day-to-day deportment, and surmised (I believe, 100% correctly) that it is most likely related to my recent reading habits. --- Just simply being reminded that there was a time, once in my life, where I was completely surrounded by high-caliber cogent beings… and of the free-thinking, free-spiritedness that once coursed and surged within me… and of who I was and what I was like  BEFORE  I met Kathy, and was married to a diagnosed sociopath (with multiple personalities, a severe prescription drug addiction, reverse-misogynistic tendencies, and a veritable who’s-who case of nymphomania) – but that’s a whole`nuther story – It is as though a weight has been lifted from me… and I thank each and every member of the old ‘scene’ for helping me reconnect with that long-forgotten part of myself.   Unfortunately, even with this newfound (rediscovered?) lightheartedness and optimism, I fear that my well-honed curmudgeonistic tendencies are here to stay!     [*  looks at clock  *]  Yikes! – Gotta go!   Cheers! Gonzo

      I’m still busy reading ( and I do mean READING - not merely skimming or browsing ) the ‘Johnson City Stories’ Blog.  Despite my busy schedule, I’m now up to the February 2003 archive…  WOW! - I had almost completely forgotten what an amazingly talented, thought-provoking, and uncommonly articulate bunch of people were among us back in ‘the day’… and it pleases me to-no-end to see that, despite all self-induced questionable-substance-fueled efforts to the contrary, apparently the vast majority of everyone’s brain cells somehow survived intact!   Truly; I can’t remember the last time I have so thoroughly enjoyed the act of reading!   So many formative experiences and life-altering (corruptive?) influences derived from my ‘doing time’ in JC ( circa 1988 to 1992, or there-abouts ) – I have quite literally laughed to the point of tears upon reading some of the accounts.     Starting the JC Blog e-venue was an EXCEPTIONAL idea!  _____________________________________________    Please forgive the following, but I really have no one else to tell ( least of which my life-mate/almost-but-not-quite-wife of 10-years! )  As a direct result of my recent reading practices, and the subsequent jarred memories that have ensued, I was awoken this morning by a dream that replayed for me, in vivid-technicolor detail, a number of scenes from one of the all-time greatest nights of my life… and being a tale of wanton lust and debauchery, its romp through my subconscious resulted in some truely momentous physical side-effects.   In addition to a racing pulse and a dead-cold sweat, I also happened to possess  the  be-all/end-all of sunrise statuaries… Ladies & gentlemen, I’m speaking not of mere morning wood here, but rather the sort of remarkably raging erection that’s (supposedly) unattainable for a man who’s quickly approaching 40-years of age… `twas a straight-up cast iron coat rack of a boner, I say; worthy of proportional effigy within any-a third world country’s urban mythology!  ( Let the congregation say 'Amen!' and brother's an sisters, can I get a 'Doy-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yoing!' ?  )   Ahh… and to the delightful and breathtakingly beautiful young lady who inspired such a provocative salute ( who, for propriety’s sake, shall remain nameless ), I offer my deepest and most heart-felt appreciation for choosing me that night to share of herself with such awesome expression and hedonism, without even one solitary thread of restraint.   NOTE: Once I finally manage to read all of the archives, and then submit myself for membership at the JC Blog - perhaps, upon request, I might be coerced into recounting the NC-17 version of that night’s events for "posterity’s sake".   _____________________________________________    On decidedly different note entirely:  To whomever it was that mentioned him, I wish to thank you for finally putting a name to the face; one that I have been completely unable to recall for so long now… Josh Morris - To this day I have yet to find another opponent at backgammon of his caliber (or even pinball for that matter).    Yes, despite all of the small-town banality, they were indeed good times!   OK, I suppose that’s about enough rear-view yammering for now…   Cheers! Gonzo

      What can I say?   OK... Right now I'm listening to the MP3 ‘album’ version of 'Don't Eat the Yellow Snow' by Frank Zappa, and drinking my third Warsteiner, after a long, hard day of pretending to be a Relational Database Consultant.   For my own personal entertainment, I am about to embark upon what will undoubtedly become an outlandish and mystical journey down Remembrance Quay, over at the Johnson City Blog.   BTW: For anyone who might be looking here, solely in the hope of unmasking me… Trust me; my identity is not anywhere near as important as all of the crystal-clear, uncannily accurate memories that I can still vividly recall about those wonderfully twisted misspent youthful years.   Oh, and one more thing… The first person to correctly put a name to this enigmatic former JC resident wins their choice of either a Free Rolling Rock Beer -or- a dupe of my prized bootleg VHS copy of Stinky Finger’s reunion show at Webster’s!    Ahhhh… The game is afoot!   Cheers! “Gonzo”
