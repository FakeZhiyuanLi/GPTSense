       MAKING MY POINT    A net buddy of mine and I have been having some good chats about different things.  He's a real radical thinker.  One of those "Looney Left".  We both have our points to make, mine are better, but one of the best debated topics we have engaged in is religious persecution.  His Point - The religious right of this country have persecuted the non-religious My Point -  The non-religious have been trying for years to silence the religious  In a recent post of his blog, he said,  "No, the REAL religious persecution comes when you (Your Average Fundy) wants to push your religion down MY throat. When you want to stick YOUR 10 Commandments into OUR court houses. When you want to shove your MISINTERPRETED religious beliefs in OUR public schools."   I'm not a religious person, as I've stated before I'm an agnostic, but it's my understanding of Christian teachings that Christ said something to the effect of "Go forth and spread the word."  That's what they’re trying to do.  Now I don't agree with it 100%.  We should leave people to worship, or not, as they see fit.  But we can't tell people to NOT try and spread the word that they live their lives by and they believe in.  That's trying to silence them.  That's persecution.  We all have the right in this great country to say what we want, within reason.  He doesn’t want the 10 Commandments in a federal courthouse.  I can understand that's his choice, but to say flat-out "no" is as bad as the ones who want it displayed flat-out saying "yes" it will be displayed.  Just because it's yours, or my, opinion doesn't make it the right one.  GM, or JW, I'm sure we'll get into a few more passionate discussions, like abortion and the death penalty, and I'm looking forward to it.      God Bless America

       DISRUPT MY DINNER AGAIN AND FEEL MY WRATH    Yesterday, President Bush signed into law the "Do Not Call List".  About time.  This list was setup to stop telemarketers from harrassing people at home.  50,000,000 Americans have signed up on the list.  All was going fine until a liberal judge here in Oklahoma said, "NO".  The the house and senate past legislation saying that it would go forward.  And yet again another liberal judge in Colorado went against the American peoples wishes and said, "NO".  And now President Bush has made it law.  It's still being contested in court, but some telemarketer have said they'll honor the list.  Good for them.  Just leave me alone.  I don't want any of the crap your trying to sell and I don't want to talk to you either.      God Bless America

       NOT A GUN BLAZING, DO OR DIE REPUBLICAN    Some here may be saying to themselves, Powerage, that's my internet name here, are you a die hard Republican?  Do all of your view mesh with those of the stereotypical conservative.  And my answer them is, "No".  Not all my views are of the conservative variety, though most are.  Some of the places were we differ are:  1.  Guns - I hate guns.  I think guns should be outlawed.  The only people in the world that need guns are the police and military. 2.  God - I'm an agnostic.  I don't not believe in God or a God, it's just that I have some trouble excepting one. 3.  Homosexuality - The stereotypical view of Republicans is that we hate gays.  While it's true that some do, it's also true that some Democrats are homophobic as well.  I don't care one way or the other.  We're born loving who we love.  We're not trained or brainwashed into it.  Those are the three big differences we have.  I'm a registered Republican, but I consider myself an Independent Conservative.  My views are my own, and I don't follow the trends set forth by other.  This also goes for everything else.  Fashion, music, movies and such.  If it's popular, I more than likely hate it.      God Bless America

       CLARK SUPPORTS W    In 2001 Wes Clark (D) made a speach to Arkansas Republicans stating that,   "I'm very glad we've got the great team in office, men like Colin Powell, Don Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Paul O'Neill - people I know very well - our president, George W. Bush. We need them there."    Clark, in the past, has voted for Nixon and Reagan, then said that we need Bush in the White House.  Make up your mind Wes.  Are you a Democrat or Republican?  The way your flip flopping on your views, you must be a Democrat.  About Ronald Wilson Reagan, Clark has said,   "We were really helped when President Ronald Reagan came in ... He was truly a great American leader. And those of us in the Armed Forces loved him, respected him and tremendously admired him."    I can't agree more with you Wes.  Ronald Reagan is, and forever will be, a great man.  A man that did change his views as well.  Looks like Clark took a cue from Reagan, but in the wrong direction.      God Bless America

       "BUBBA" CLINTON WON THE WAR    Well according to Hillary.    Credit to Newsmax.com   Who deserves credit for America's military victory over Saddam Hussein's armies four months ago?  Why, the Clinton administration, of course – at least according to Hillary Clinton.  The former first lady made the bizarre assertion Wednesday morning during remarks at Washington, D.C.'s Godfrey Sperling breakfast.  According to the Washington Times, she based the claim on something Vice President Dick Cheney said during Desert Storm about wars being won with the prior administration's military.   By that measure, said then-Defense Secretary Cheney, he should have written a thank-you note to President Reagan after Gulf War I.  "I don't think [Cheney has] done that to my husband yet," Hillary said, adding, "I'd be happy to deliver it personally."     I knew the Clinton's were arrogant and conceded, but this is laughable.  The man who effectively destroyed the military during his 8-year reign, and his wife thinks we should thank him.  Dear God.  Other news that I haven't had the chance to report on. Carol Moseley Braun announced that she in the race officially.  Why?  No offense to her, I'm sure she's a very nice and intelligent woman, but she hasn't a snowballs chance in hell of winning.  Why waste the money?  I don't know.  A California Gubernatorial debate took place last night.  I don't think there was a real winner, but I do think two people lost it.  Arrian Huffington and Cruz Bustamante.  She was like a yapping dog the whole time.  She was in attack mode against Arnold.  Funny, when just a couple of months ago she was knocking over microphones and people just to try and get next to him for a photo.  Bustamante pulled and Al Gore.  He kept sighing and rolling his eyes everytime someone attacked him.  That's a no-no Cruz, didn't you learn anything for Al two years ago?  And lastly, for Gohan.   LOOK INTO MY EYES. (.)(.)  YOU WILL COME OVER TO THE DARK SIDE.  LEAVE THE LIBERAL PARTY, GO CONSERVATIVE.  ITS NOT ALL THAT BAD.  I CAN HELP YOU FIND YOUR WAY.      God Bless America

       NEWS, NEWS AND MORE NEWS    Been away for a couple of days, but now I'm back.  Let's get to the news.  Hurricane Isabel made landfall yesterday.  Good news and sad news to report about Isabel.  Good news is that it really fell apart before it made landfall.  Isable started as a catagory 5 hurricane, but by the time it made landfall it was downgraded to a catagory 1-2.  Could have been a hundred times worse than it was.  The sad news is that 17 people, as of this reporting, lost their lives as a result to the storm.  I'm sure our thoughts and prayers go out to those that lost loved ones.  The 9th circuit court of appeals agrees to reconsider the delay of the California re-call election.  The "Go cry to your mamma" Democrats and the ACLU, more about them below, originaly went to the 9th circuit court trying to get it pushed back to March of next year.  Read the post "LOONY LEFT CRY FOUL" for more info.  Three left wing judges ruled that the re-call election was unconstitutional because of the punch card voting machines in use in 44% of California.  But they were okay when Davis won re-election the last time around.  The ACLU, stands for Anit-Conservative Liberal Union, are a bunch of hypocrites.  Over the week, the liberal Lord and Savior, Bill Clinton made a stop in California to help Grey Davis beat back the vast Right-Wing consperacy and their attempst to remove the bumbling Governer from office.  The two silver haired conmen paid a visit to a church in California to hold the rally.  Now the ACLU is suppost to be all for the serparation of Chuch and State, yet they have yet to protest Clinton and Davis's actions.  Holding a polital rally in a church, sounds like the bringing together of Church and State to me.  I wonder if Bush were to hold a re-election rally in a church, would the ACLU protest and bitch about it?  You better believe it.  The Vatican has thrown it's endorsement  behind Mel Gibson's latest film, The Passion.  The film is about the last hours of Christ.  Many have condimed this film as being anti-semitic.  But Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos has been quoted as saying, "I would like all Catholic priests in the world to see this film. I hope that all Christians can see it, everyone in the world."  I for one want to see this movie.  I'm not a religious person, I'm a agnostic, but this movie looks very interesting to me.  And finally,  Bill O'Reilly's new book,  Who's Looking Out for You? , is set to be released the 23rd of this month.  It's destined to by a best seller, but I urge everyone to go out and buy a copy of it.  That's a lot of news.      God Bless America

       ANALYSIS OF THE BIG, AND NOT SO BIG, TEN    Well, we now have 10 Democrats vying for the nomination.  Let’s see if I can name them all.         Dean – Front runner.  Something evil about his eyes.  Don’t trust him.  Wants to take money away from the poor.  He wants to repeal all the tax cuts  Kerry – Vietnam War vet.  Tries to portray himself as the big war hero. Edwards – Good ‘Ol boy, but ashamed of it. Clark – Eisenhower wannabe.  But not.  Michael Moore's favorite.  Moore's endorsment alone would be enough to make me drop out. Lieberman – The only one that makes any sense. Sharpton- No chance in hell. Kucinich – Who? Braun – Again, who? Gephardt – No chance. Graham – Again, no chance in hell.     Damn, that’s better than most of the country.  Most of the country can’t even name one of them.  The thing about these candidates is, not what they have to say, because so far they haven’t said anything about how they would do something, it’s all about who can bash Bush the best.  That’s who’s going to get the nomination.  All you have to say is “Bush is bad” the best way and *BOOM* you have the nomination.  The Democrats are still upset that they lost in 2000 and 2002, so it’s whoever can stir up those feelings the best that they will choose.       God Bless America

       SOCIALIZED HEALTH CARE NUMBER ONE?   Credit to moorewatch.com & thisisderbyshire.co.uk     A Son says he is disgusted that his late mother was forced to wait eight "traumatic" hours for an ambulance.  Stephen Brown even managed to fly back from a Spanish holiday and get to the hospital before his eighty-six-year-old mum, Clarice Burgin.  It was on August 11 that mum-of-nine Mrs Burgin became ill at her house in Western Spot Close, Ripley. Her family called her GP, who suspected pneumonia and immediately called an ambulance to take her to hospital within two hours. To meet Government targets, this should have arrived within 15 minutes of that two-hour spell.  That was at 2.20pm. The ambulance eventually arrived after 10pm. During the eight-hour wait, family members called the service several times, only to be told they were busy and it would be there soon.  Their mum eventually arrived at Derby City General Hospital at 10.45pm. Mr Brown (41), of Borrowfield Road, Spondon, was already there.  The next day, Mrs Burgin suffered a stroke and was later transferred to Ripley Hospital, where she died on September 6.  While I agree, in general, with the government taking over some of the health care of the eldery, I think it needs to be refined and worked out better.  I mean eight hours for an ambulance it an outrage.  These people haved worked for 50-60 years of their lives.  When they retire, some aren't able to pay for everything they need.  Something needs to be done about this.  Lower prescription costs or something.      God Bless America

       ANOTHER RAT IN THE RACE    In another show of Democrat hypocrisy, liberals are rejoicing today at the announcement of retired General Wesley Clark throwing his hat into the 2004 presidential election.  Where does the hypocrisy come in?  During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Democrats where everywhere yelling about how war is immoral and wrong, yet they can’t stop creaming their jeans over Clark and John Kerry.  Two men who fought in Vietnam.  Two men who where there killing people, the very thing Democrats where bitching about over the last year.  Can you say double standard?  Where are Democrats morals?  Where are their ethics?  You either support war veterans, or you don’t.  You can’t pick and choose the ones you love and the ones you hate.  But this is nothing new.  During Clinton’s ’98 bombing of Iraq, Democrats supported him and his statements that Hussein had WMD.  But Bush says the exact same thing, and they get their panties in a bunch and call him a liar.      God Bless America

       FLYING THE FLAG IS NOW WRONG    At least according to ex-Marine George Andres's homeowners association.  The association in question has threatened to forclose on Mr. Andres's home in an attempt to collect legal expenses and fines it says he owes because of his defiance of association’s orders to remove his flagpole.  However, thanks to Sean Hannity of the Fox News show Hannity and Colmes, this story has become something of a nation wide phenomenon.  Mr. Hannity has stated that he would raise at least $25,000 for Mr. Andres's cause.  Even going so far as to pledge $5,000 of his own money.    Newsmax.com     What the hell has happened to this country when we aren't even allowed to fly the U.S. flag?  This flag symbolizes everything this great country stands for.  The founding fathers must be turning over in their graves with the mess we have become. To find out how this sad turn of events happened, go to  Newsmax.com  for the story.      God Bless America

       LOONY LEFT CRY FOUL    The “Go cry to your mamma” democrats have done it again.  They are now saying that the California gubernatorial recall is “unfair” because of the punch-card system 44% of California uses.  However, they thought it was okay when Davis won re-election the last time.  What’s different this time?  The fact that it looks like Davis is a goner and that a Republican could very well be the next Governor of loony land California.  Just another example of how the liberal left cries foul every time something doesn’t go their way.     God Bless America, God Bless Republicans

       WHAT HAPPENED?    The world as we know it is over.  Jennifer Lopez, J-Lo, and Ben Affleck, B-Fleck, have apparently broken up.  What will we do now?  Their romance was the glue that held this world together.  If those two crazy kids can’t make it in the day and age, then what hope do any of us have?   It’s a sad state of affairs when this is the biggest news of the day.  Who gives a rat’s ass about these people and their relationship?  Morons, that’s who.  I don’t care about celebs.  I am sick and tired of people putting these idiots up on pedestals.  This also goes for athletes.  Football, basketball, golf, tennis, baseball and the rest.  If I had my way, sports would be outlawed.  Except baseball and pro-wrestling.     THOSE CRAZY FRENCH    The French are at it again.  For some strange reason, they feel that we should have a working Iraqi government up and running in under a month.  WTF?  They feel that the UN should play the main role in the rebuilding of Iraq, if not the only roll.  Well, we all know how well the UN does its job.  Bosnia, Africa and many, many more.  After W.W.II, we were in Germany for  years  just to try and get it going in the right direction.  And it worked, for awhile anyway.  France needed years to find it’s way from a monarchy to democracy.  In Bosnia, the UN set up a government in under a year after the war.  Held and election and, well, we all know what happened there.  The UN has shown itself as an inept group of pacifist wimps.

       Introduction    This in an intro to me and my mindless, pointless, everyday Blog.  My name is Chris.  I made this Blog to post my thoughts on the things happening in the world today, and what ever else I want to ramble on about.  You won't find anything amazing for exciting here.  Sorry.    Now a little info about me.  I'm 24 and single.  I'm into  REAL   rock and roll.  Not that crap that's out there today.  Give me 70's rock, or give me death.  IMO, AC/DC is the best damn band on the face of the planet yesterday, today and tomorrow.  I read Stephen King.  I'm some what of a computer geek.  As the name of this blog says, I'm a Conservative Republican.  I feel that Ronald Wilson Reagan was the best leader this county ever had.  With this Blog, I hope to change the minds of people out there and bring over to the Right.  That probably won't happen, but I can dream can't I?

       MORE STORIES ON MOORE   Moorewatch.com has some interesting pieces on that lovable practitioner of tolerance, as long as it's Liberal speech, Michael Moore.  I’ll just write out the gist of the stories and you can click the Moorewatch.com link to read the full stories.  One story talks about Moore's hypocrisy.  He goes around this country preaching the evils of corporate America.  Do you know how he does this?  With the help of corporate America.  On his recent tour for his new book, Time Warner sent Moore across the country on a private jet, arranged to have it chauffeured around town in corporate owned SUV's and hired him ARMED bodyguards.  Doesn't Moore despise guns?  Apparently only when their not protecting his prominent ass.  The second story talks about Moore said that the fires in California that have killed at least 17 men, women and children were the wrath of God for electing Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Now that's humane thinking.     God Bless America

       MICHAEL MOORE BEING SUED   James Nichols, the brother of Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Nichols, is suing Moore for defamation of character.  Moore used Nichols in his mocumentry,  Bowling For Columbine .  Nichols claims he was tricked into apprearing in the mocumentry.  He also says in the lawsuit that Moore libeled him by linking him to the terrorist act in Oklahoma City.  In the lawsuit, Moore is accused of libel, defamation of character, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  According to the Detroit Free Press, Nichols's attorney are asking for a jury trial and damages ranging from $10-$20 million on each of nine counts.  I'm not sure if this will go to court, but if it does Moore could be looking at a huge chunk of change being taken away from him.

       WHAT MEDIA BIAS?   CSPAN is going to be showing the A.N.S.W.E.R. Anti-War rally that's being held in Washington D.C. today, yet they won't be showing the Pro-America rally that's being held later in the day.  Why?  Is there a bias over at CSPAN against the people who support what President Bush and the troops are doing in Iraq?  I'll let you make up your own mind, but I think you know where I stand on this.

       THE PASSION OF CHRIST   "The Passion of Christ" is a go.  February 25, 2004 is the date that has been set for it's opening.  People have been fighting this movie every step of the way trying to stop it.  People have come out and called Mel Gibson an "Anti-Semite" without ever have seeing the film.  Movie studios all over Hollyweird refused to touch it.  Gibson finally found a studio with the balls to pick it up.  Newmarket Films, along with Gibson's own production company Icon Films, will distribute the movie.  Newmarket Films is the studio behind such movies as "Real Women Have Curves" and "Memento."  "The Passion of Christ", in case you don't know, is about the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ.  It stars James Caviezel (The Count Of Monte Cristo) as Jesus and Monica Bellucci(The Matrix: Reloaded) as Mary Magdalene and was filmed in Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic, but has English subtitles.    I for one can't wait to see this.  I'm not a religious person, as I've stated before I'm an agnostic, but this film really intrigues me.  It holds nothing back.  It shows the story in very graphic detail.  If you would like to see the trailer,  urlLink HERE's the link.  Just scroll around and find it.  It looks like it's going to be a great movie.     God Bless America

       TAKE THE KID AWAY   Recently Cortney Love, former frontwoman for Hole, overdosed on Oxycontin at her Beverly Hills home.  While she was doing this, her 11-year-old daughter was in the house with her.  In a recent interview, Love said that she tried to make the overdose "fun" for her daughter so she wouldn't be scared.  She added, "That's the only time my daughter has ever, ever, ever pitched in on one of my little crises. I made it fun. I said it was going to be gross and I was going to have to make myself throw up but it was going to be OK."  After the overdose, Love's daughter was taken from her and put into her grandmother's care.  The grandmother, mother of late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, has questioned Love's ability as a mother - but the singer insists the overdose was a minor glitch.  A minor glitch?  What the hell.  This woman has a history of drug problems.  This little girl was born into a bad situation.  As much as I love Nirvana and Kurt Cobain, he was not meant to be a father.  And Love sure as hell should not have ever been a mother.  This little girl should be taken from Love until she cleans herself up for good.  Love doesn't desirve the child.  I know some are saying, "Oxycontin.  Rush Limbaugh.  What's the difference."  Or maybe something to that effect.  Two things separate these incidents.  Limbaugh doesn't have a little kid that depends on him and I didn't call for Love to serve jail time.  Both need help, and I truly hope they get the help they need.  Love more than Limbaugh.     God Bless America

       CBS's LIE    CBS has been caught with their pants down around their ankles.  In the upcoming movie "The Reagans", starring James Brolin, husband of Republican hater Barbra Streisand, as the greatest president of the 20th centry, the writers had a line in the script where President Reagan's charcter said to his wife, went talking about people with AIDS, "They that live in sin shall die in sin".  Something like this makes President Reagan out to be a horrible, hate filled man.  But, as it turns out, President Reagan never said anything like that.  Does this show CBS's distaste for the Conservative president, or does it show that Streisand had a hand in getting this script written.  Either way it just show yet another example of the Hollywood establishments lies about Conservatives.  To read the full article, click  urlLink here .  And read what Australian actress Judy Davis had to say about patriotism.      God Bless America

       HYPOCRICY, DOUBLE STANDARDS AND THE AMERICAN LEFT    Newsmax recently published and article about the double standard in the media when it comes to hate speech.  In the article the reporter, along with PTC director Brent Bozell, who I don’t particularly like myself, talk about how the mainstream media go after certain people for the stupid things they say, MSNBC’s firing of Michael Savage for what he said about people with AIDS and Trent Lott and what he said at Sen. Strom Thurman's 100 birthday, while others go unchecked.  Two examples Bozell cited were:   Julianne Malveaux, who apparntly has a show on PBS, I’ve never heard of her, stated that she hoped Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas’s wife “feeds him lots of eggs and butter and he dies early, like many other black men do, of heart disease”.  While others on her show protested, Ms. Malevaux hasn’t back down from her statement.  Saying, “Well, that’s how I feel.  He is an absolutely reprehensible person”.  PBS has yet to fire, censure, rebuke, criticize or even talk to Ms. Malevaux.  NPR host, Nina Totenberg, made at statement that she wished death on Sen. Jesse Helms and his family after he said AIDS research was overfunded compared to more common life-threatening diseases.  To that she added, “if there is retributive justice, he’ll get AIDS form a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will get it”.  Ms. Totenberg was not fired, reprimanded nor did she issue an apology.   I guess hate speech is okay, if it’s spouted by a liberal.  If Newt Gingrich were to say that he hoped Hillary Clinton were to die in an automobile accident, imagine what the public outcry would be.  Hypocrisy and double standards.       God Bless America

       LUDACRIS FIGHTS BACK    Earlier in the year, Fox News's Bill O'Reilly, raised an uproar over the fact that Pepsi had hired the wannabe badass as one of their pitchmen.  O'Reilly called for a boycott of Pepsi and all their products, and the people came out in force, forcing Pepsi to drop the modern day poet from their adds.  An act I agree with 100%.  As this was all going on, O'Reilly made the prediction that the rapper would shot back in one of his "songs".  And he was right.  In Ludacris's new album, Chicken and Beer, he took his pot shot at the juggernaut of Fox News.  In the song "Hoes in My Room", along with that other master of the mic Snoop Dogg, he says:   “Now, these chicks wouldn't leave, they was ready to clown One was 5'6 and weighed three hundred pounds (No she didn't come thru with a thong on She did for the hell of it, big fat whale of it) You can't seperate me, Ima seperate you Bitch ya' pussy smell like Pepe Le Pew (You filthy, nasty, sick in the head Sittin' in my dressin room with dick on ya' bread) She said "I want you to climb in this underwear, silly" But I was turned off by her tupper-ware titties (Fake bitches, break bitches, make bitches Kick rocks, when they fucked up in they face Tick-tock, you gots to get up out my space Hey Ludacris let's get the fuck up out this place, let's bounce) Then it got to my head, and somethin' reminded me I know who let 'em in, it was Bill O'Reilly (Faggot) (Ya' white bread, chicken-shit nigga!)”   A masterpiece of literature, if I do say so myself.  Should be cherished for all time.   (He typed with sarcasm)   Just another example of a guy who pretends to be tough being able to dish insults out, but when something happens to him he can't take it.  I'm sure O'Reilly is in his dressing room crying his eyes out over this comeback.  Peace homey, I'm getting the shizzel out.      God Bless America

       THE 2003 LEFTY AWARDS    In the September issue of Newsmax, the best magazine in the world, they have the winners of the 2003 Lefty Awards.  The awards that celebrate those that think they know better than anyone else how the country should be ran.  10.  Janeane Garofalo - "If the Iraqis were to welcome the U.S. troops, I'll go to the White House on my hands and knees on cut glass and say 'Hey, you were right, I shouldn't have doubted you.'"  We're still waiting Janeane.  9.  Tim Robbins - The man who celebrates peace and love said this to a reporter, "If you ever write about my family again, I will fucking find you and I will fucking hurt you."  A little on the aggressive side there, aren't we Mr. Sarandon.  8.  Sean Penn - Yet again, another man who wants peace and good will toward man.  He punched a photographer in the face for doing his job.  Also he's Saddam's own personal spinner.  7.  Harry Belfonte - He calls Bush an evil man while parading around in support of Castro.  The man that really does oppress his people.  Plus he made some racist statements about Colin Powell being the "house nigger" at the White House.  Not too much uproar of this though.  6.  Martin Sheen - In his own mind, as well as a few of the Loony Left's, he the real president because he plays one on t.v.  He should have kept the tape on over his mouth.  He has every right to say what he want's, it's just that I don't want to hear it.  5.  Danny Glover - He's called Bush a racist, placed the blame for 9-11 on the U.S. and called America "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world."  Let's see.  Cuba, Iraq and China either have in the past, or in China's case still do, throw people in jail and kill them for speaking up against the Government.  And we're the greatest purveyors of violence in the world?  4.  Jessica Lange - "I hate Bush.  I despise him, I despise his administration and everything they stand for".  "It makes me fell ashamed to come from the United States.  It is humiliating."  Well good for you Ms. Lange.  Speak your mind.  Because that's the right we have in this great nation.  Something I'm sure you take for granted.  How about moving to China or Cuba?  Then let's see how you fell about America then.  3.  George Clooney - "Charlton Heston announced again today that he is suffering from Alzheimer's".  Class.  That's how you describe George "Loony" Clooney.  When a man says someone deserves to have a terminal disease because he's the head of the NRA, that's class.  2.  Natalie Maines - "We're ashamed that the president is from Texas".  I don't think he's celebrating the fact that you are as well.  F.U.T.K.  Fuck You Toby Keith.  She had this written on her shirt at the ACM awards.  Reminds me of when I was in school.  You know, first grade.  Real mature.  1.  And the number one Lefty that can't seem to shut his massive mouth.  Yours and my favorite loony, hypocrite extraordinaire Michael Moore.  You all know how I feel about Moore.  If being a moron were a crime, Moore would be public enemy number one.  He looks like he’s never meet a razor or a bathtub he liked.  Or a refrigerator he didn’t.  He talks about being one of the common folks.  He talks about hard times people live through.  Yet he does this from his very expensive Manhattan apartment or from his limo he rides around town in.  He’s called the heroes from Flight 93, he plane that crashed in the Pennsylvania field on 9-11, “scardey-cats because they were mostly white.  If the passengers had included black men those killers, with their puny bodies and unimpressive small knives, would have been crushed by the dudes.”  He uses the working class as his stage props for his mocumentries.  He sends his kid, yea, I know, scary thought that Moore has reproduced, to private school while the working class he claims to support can’t even scrape together enough money to give their kids a nice Christmas. He’s a liar, a hypocrite and cares nothing for the real people of this county.  Only lining his wallet, and stomach, with a much as he can get his hands on.  Thereâ€™s a few more they could have added. Barbra Streisand, Susan Sarandon, Alec Baldwin, Johnny Depp, Al Frankin, Bruce Springsteen just to name a few.      God Bless America

       SOCIALISM FAILS YET AGAIN     The Sun, a paper from England, has an interesting article on that countries socialist health care system.  The gist of the piece is a 62-year-old grandmother in England had to lie to get a hernia operation that she need.  She had three previous canceled admissions.  Click  urlLink here  to read the full story.  First France and their thousands apon thousands of deaths due to the heatwave they had earlier this year, then the story that I posted about on Sep. 16 and now this.  Free health care, well I guess you get what you pay for.      God Bless America

       MOORE DOES IT AGAIN    Michael Moore has shown his true colors once again.  He was a guest recently on CNN's Crossfire, and this is what he had to say about the September 11th hijackers:    "I'd like to ask the question whether September 11 was a terrorist attack, or was it a military attack? We call it a terrorist attack. We keep calling it a terrorist attack.   But it sure has the markings of a military attack. And I'd like to know whose military was involved in this precision, perfectly planned operation. I'm sorry, but my common sense has never allowed me to believe since that day that you can learn how to fly a plane at 500 miles per hour. And you know, when you go up 500 miles an hour, if you're off by this much, you're in the Potomac. You don't hit a five-store building like that.   You don't learn how to do that at some rinky-dink flight training school in Florida on a little video game with PacMan buttons. I'm sorry. I just don't buy that.  And I'd like to know what the involvement was within the Saudi military or the Saudi royal family or what rogue elements within the Saudi regime, whatever it is. I want to read those 28 pages and I want to know what the truth is."    This absolute piece of shit refuses to call them terrorist.  First off, you don't learn on a little video game with PacMan buttons.  You learn on a full simulator.  You know the kind that looks and handles just like a real plane.  And to further show how much is head is up his ass, he thinks they learned how to fly these types of plane in a military, then came to America and enrolled in a flight school.  What the hell.  Why would they enroll in a flight school if they already knew how to fly?  The man is just a sorry, worthless sack of crap.  Seriously, no matter what your opinions about Bush and the war, you have got to be absolutely delusional to even entertain this ridiculous idea. This ranks right up there with the French claim that all the Jews were told to stay away from work on 9/11.    Credit to Moorewatch.com for the quote and the last few lines in my rant.

        THE MATRIX: RELOADED     I've been hearing people bitch and moan for months about how Reloaded wasn't any good, wasn't as good as the first or I was dissapointed.  I bought the DVD today, watched and what the hell are people talking about.  This was a kickass movie.  The whole freeway scene was sick.  Wish I had surround sound, damn.  Some were expecting some new revolutionary efx and forgot what they were watching.  A sequel to a mega movie.  The sequels are rarely better that the first.  1 out of 10 are as good or better than the first.  For me, this was just as good.  Makes me mad I have to wait almost a half a damn year to see the third.  I don't go to the theater, cost too damn much.      God Bless America

       FLASH MOBS    This post is about flash mobs and the morons that participate in them.  If you've never heard of a flash mob,  don’t worry, your not alone, it's when one moron posts on a website a time and place to meet, then other morons go to said location at said time and do something stupid for a few seconds then just disperse.    Examples of flash mobs: recently in Germany, a group of these idiotic morons gathered at a washing machine display in a departments store, ate bananas and left.  Or at a Toys ‘R’ Us, hundreds gathered around a dinosaur near the entrance then all fell to the ground, screaming and waving their hands, the quickly left.  Flash mobs are technically illegal, because they are disturbing the peace, but police are unable to do anything because by the time they’re able to respond, these low I.Q'ed monkey butt sniffers are gone.  There have been no reports of these stupid things happening around where I live, thank God.  I'd have to pop some of these jackasses upside the head should I get trapped near one.  If I owned a business and one of these asinine things took place, I’d sure as hell lock the door and call the cops.  You don't bring your childish crap to me and expect me to play along.

       THE GOVENATOR    Arnold Schwarzenegger is the new Governor of California.  In a landslide victory Schwarzenegger beat out all 134 of his opponents.  The current, future ex-Governor, Gray Davis was booted out by the people with a clear message, "Get Out".  A Republican winning California, it just amazes this Republican.  But it's only a matter time.  The "Go Cry To Your Mamma" Democrats have stated that they will file a recall postion agains Schwarzenegger should he win.  Their willing to put the people of California through all of this again, no matter the cost.  Sad.      God Bless America

       O'REILLY NUMBER ONE    On October 12, Bill O'Reilly's book, Who's Looking Out For You?, will debut at number one on the New York Times bestseller's list.  A fact that the New York Times hates.  The NYT hates Bill O'Reilly, and I can see why.  He's been a thorn in their side for awhile now.  He's blowen the lid off their lies and they can't stand it.  O'Reilly's book will now take over the spot the mentaly disturbed Al Franken's book once helt.  Good work Bill, the people of this country sure know quality when they see it.

       FLUFF PIECE    I have nothing to report of commentate on.  This is just a fluff piece.  A piece on my favorite music and bands.  Let's get started shall we.     ROCK AND ROLL    AC/DC - If you don't like AC/DC, you must love pop or rap music.  AC/DC are the kings of rock.  No one can out power or out entertain The Thunder From Down Under  Led Zeppelin - The Godfathers of rock.  Amazing sound and power  Pink Floyd - Psychedelic masterpieces were their early stuff.  A little strange at first listen, but it grows on you  Bad Company - Paul Rogers has one of the most amazing voices in rock  Jimi Hendrix - Need I say more  Rush - The thinking mans rock and rollers  The Doors - Amazing sound.  Jim Morrison was one of the greatest poets while he was alive  The Rolling Stones - Long lasting band with a great blues influenced sound     BLUES      Indigenous - Great Indian blues band from South Dakota.  Mato Nanji has one of the most amazing voices and one hell of a guitar player  Kenny Wayne Shepherd - Great young blues man.  He's only like 21, but he sounds like he's been playing for twice that long  Koko Taylor - Dear God.  Her voice could make a man's knees weak  Stevie Ray Vaughan - The greatest white man to ever pick up a guitar.  Died way too early.  He just got himself cleaned up and was making a come-back when we was taken  I urge everyone to go out and buy a CD from everyone of these artists.  You won't be disappointed.

       DID BUSH LIE?    It's been months since President Bush made the claim that Saddam Hussein had WMD, which was ONE of the justifications for going to war.  Along with the fact that he was a murdering madman and the Iraqi people deserved the same freedom that we Americans take for granted.  So far we have yet to find the WMD that President Bush claimed Hussein had.  Was the intelligence we had wrong?  Did Bush lie to the people, ala Clinton?  Was everything just wrong?  No.  If you think were going to find Saddam's WMD in Iraq, you need to open your eyes.  If we want to find the anthrax, botulinum and what ever else he had, we’re going to have to go to Syria, Pakistan, Iran or even Saudi Arabia.  That's where he did them.  Hussein wasn't a stupid man.  He was a dumb, crazy murder, but not stupid.  He thought that, if worse came to worse, we would go into Iraq, defeat his army and demand to be show the weapons.  He would tell us that he had none, when all the time he had them moved out of the country or moved to the most remote part of Iraq.  He never thought we would go into Baghdad and throw his ass out of power.  There is a good chance we'll never find his weapons because we're not allowed to go into the countries that I mentioned above.  But we are making progress. Chief Inspector David Kay says in his report that Saddam Hussein's regime had a clandestine network of biological laboratories, a live strain of deadly agent botulinum, sophisticated concealment efforts and advanced design work on prohibited longer-range missiles.  And in front of the House and Senate Select Intelligence Committees, Keys said that at this point, we have found substantial evidence of an intent of senior-level Iraqi officials, including Saddam, to continue production at some future point in time of weapons of mass destruction. We have not found at this point actual weapons.  What’s really need is to kill Saddam.  When his scientists know he’s dead and won’t be coming after them, they’ll talk.  As long as they think he’s alive they’ll be too afraid to talk to the U.S.      God Bless America

       ONE'S RACIST THE OTHER ISN'T    The same of people who don't say a word when Democrats such as Cruz Bustamante and Sen. Robert "KKK" Byrd say "nigger" in public are getting their panties in a bunch over comments Rush Limbaugh made about Philadelphia quarterback Donovan McNabb.  On ESPN's show "Sunday NFL Countdown" Limbaugh said of McNabb,    "I don't think he's been that good from the get-go.  I think what we've had here is a little social concern in the NFL. The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. There is a little hope invested in McNabb, and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didn't deserve. The defense carried this team."     I don't understand this crap.  Where is the racism in that statement?  Presidental candidate Wes Clark and Democratic Rep. Harold Ford Jr. of Tenn. have called for ESPN to fire Linbaugh.  Yet they haven't called for Bustamante or Byrd to resign. Funny, isn't it.  I used the word "nigger" for a reason, read below.  In yet another twisted view on racism, a judge in Washington state has ruled that the football team Washington Redskins could continue using the name.  The judge said that there was no sufficant evidance to show that the word "Redskin" is a racist term.  What the hell?  The word "Redskin" is a diragatory word for and American Indian, just like the word "nigger" is a racist, diragatory word for blacks in this country.   Redskin Noun: offensive terms for Native Americans  This according to the dictionary.  As a Cherokee I find this word, as well as this ruling, highly offensive and a slap in the face.

       CALL A PLUMBER    This has been the big news story for the past 2-3 days, so I have to post on it.  Are there leaks in the White House?  As you all know by now, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Joseph Wilson, has made the alligations that someone in the Bush White House leaked the info that his wife is a CIA weapons analyst.  Wilson went out to talkshows accused top Bush political strategist Karl Rove of leaking the name to columnist Robert Novak, telling a Seattle audience last month that he wanted  "to see whether or not we can get Karl Rove frog-marched out of the White House in handcuffs."   However, on Monday Wilson told ABC's "Good Morning America" on that he got "carried away" and made up the Rove allegation out of thin air.  Mr. Wilson says this all started because he spoke up against the Bush administation and it's handling of Iraq.    The columnist, Robert Novak, has stated many times that no one inside the Bush administation leaked the info to him.  Novak should have known better than to print this info.  Any smart person would.  He's a Republican I'm sad to say, but he's a CNN Republican.  That tells the whole story right there.  The Democats have gotten their panties all in a bunch over this.  For some reason the liberal keep refering to her as a "covert agent" and "undercover agent".  Shes not.  She was an analyst, not a spy, not a covert operative, and not in charge of undercover operatives.  Some Dems have went so far as to say this is the greatest travisty they have ever seen.  Yet they were silent when the Liberal Lord & Savoir Bill "Bubba" Clinton attempted to destroy one political opponent after another by illegally leaking damaging material to the media.  Lets take a look at the Clinton offences.    - Paula Jones, whose tax returns were illegally leaked in Sept. 1997 to New York Daily News columnist Lar Erik Nelson. Nelson promptly detailed the material in his column, arguing that Jones deserved to be audited by the IRS because of the way she reported contributions to her defense fund.  Nelson, who has since died, insisted at the time that Jones' returns were given to him, not by the Clinton White House, but by one of her "friends". Some friend     - Then there was Linda Tripp, whose Pentagon personnel file was illegally leaked in 1998 by a Clinton Defense Department flak to New Yorker Magazine writer Jane Mayer, who promptly splashed details of Tripp's shoplifting arrest as a teenager across its pages.  The Clinton Justice Department investigated the charge, and came up, not surprisingly, completely empty. Democrat outrage over the obvious cover-up: Bubkiss.     -  And where were our self-appointed guardians of privacy when the White House decided that the best way to discredit Clinton sexual assault accuser Kathleen Willey was to release her personal correspondence to the press.  U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth later ruled that the shabby manuever was a criminal violation of the Privacy Act. Democrats, however, stayed mum.     - And what about the mother of all White House privacy violations, Filegate. Over 1100 FBI files on Republicans were dispatched into the custody of bar bouncer-turned-White House security chief Craig Livingstone.   The request for the files came on memos from the office of then-White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, a Hillary Clinton appointee. Nussbaum told FBI agent Dennis Sculimbrene that Livingstone had been hired on Hillary's recommendation.   And according to Linda Tripp, the office of Mrs. Clinton's former law partner, William Kennedy, who served as Associate White House Counsel, was crammed with stacks of the illegally obtained files.  When President Clinton proclaimed that the largest invasion of privacy in White House history was merely "a bureaucratic snafu," Democrats agreed nearly unanimously.  Now let's get to the real daming offences.  Newly declassified documents show that President Bill Clinton, in 1996, personally approved the transfer to China of advanced space technology that can be used for nuclear combat.  To read the whole story, go to http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/9/29/25139.shtml  Some may say, "But Newsmax is a conservative biased site".  You may see it that way, but I could make the same arrgument about the  C linton  N ews  N etwork.  Just read it.    I would also like to say that all the info I got is from Newsmax.      God Bless America

       THE DAY AFTER, OR, GOD, WHAT DID I DO LAST NIGHT   A slight Rocky and Bullwinkle reference there.  Well, it Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.  Also know as "Black Friday".  The day when the all the nuts go to the stores and get their holiday shopping in gear.  Well, HA, I'm done.  I'm not going to fight that crowd.    Well, I had my dinner last night.  Turkey, stuffing, chicken and noodles, ham, turkey tetrazzini(damn good stuff) and pumpkin pie.  And I think I over did it and I'm paying for it today.  I won't go into details, but sufficed to say me that my toilet are becoming the best of friends today.  I can't eat as much as I use to.  I'm getting my Christmas decorations up.  The tree, wreaths, my Victorian Santas(love these things) and all my fiber optic stuff.  Love the fiber optic.  I will leave you this fine day with one of my new quotes:   Being Half Right Means You're Still Wrong.  If you're going out in the mess today, stay safe and have fun.

       BUSH IN IRAQ   No, this post isn't about the first porno being made in Iraq.  Okay, okay, that was low class and in bad taste, but I'm in a good mood today.  It's Thanksgiving.  The day in which we celebrate the lies and falsehoods given to the Indians during the time of the pilgrims.  I like the general message of Thanksgiving, but not what the truth of it is.  I also love the turkey and stuffing.  Anyway, back on topic.  President Bush made a suprise visit to the troops in Iraq today.  This wasn't leaked to the public for safety reasons, that's why we had no idea it happened until after he was back in the air coming home.  President Bush made the trip to Baghdad and surprised about 600 of our bravest men and women when he arrived.  The President had thanksgiving dinner with them and told them he was proud of the job they were doing in Iraq.  Reports have it that they were very excited by his visit and welcomed him there.  It's just another reiteration that the U.S. military loves President Bush.  In other news, Sen. Hillary Clinton went the Afghanistan to visit the troops there.  I'm sure they were thrilled to have her there.  The wife of the man that almost destroyed the military under his watch.  I don’t think she will, but it wouldn’t surprise me if she somehow found a way to bash President Bush while there.  A link note.  I've taken out the text link for the American Indian Movement.  It's now a pic link.  I'm sure you can find it.     God Bless America

       SHOOTING AT A KKK RALLY   The following is from the AP.  It's the funniest damn thing I've ever heard of.  Enjoy.   JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. - A bullet fired in the air during a Ku Klux Klan initiation ceremony came down and struck a participant in the head, critically injuring him, authorities said.  Gregory Allen Freeman, 45, was charged with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment in the Saturday night incident that wounded Jeffery S. Murr, 24.  About 10 people, including two children, had gathered for the ceremony. The man who was being initiated was blindfolded, tied with a noose to a tree and shot with paintball guns as Freeman fired a pistol in the air to provide the sound of real gunfire, Sheriff Fred Phillips said.  A bullet struck Murr on the top of the head and exited at the bottom of his skull, authorities said.  Freeman fled the ceremony but was arrested near his home, authorities said. He was released on $7,500 bail.    HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Poetic Justice.     God Bless America

       YES, IT'S THE BENNY HILL SHOW   I know I said I would give you my review of this DVD, but I had to take two days to watch it.  I know you've been waiting on pins and needles to know what I thought, so I won't keep you is suspense any longer.  "The Benny Hill Show" was a show that objectified women and sex things.  It was sexist, at times childish and verged on racist at times.  The women, know as Hill's Angels, wore the bare minimum you could wear without being nude.  It was raunchy and immatureish, and I loved every minute of it.  This was the funniest damn thing, next to "Monty Python's Flying Circus", I have ever seen.  The man was a comic genius.  Hill's Angels, his group of dancers, was packed full of gorgeous women.  One of them being Jane Leeves, from "Frasier".  I've had a crush on Leeves since "Frasier" started, so it was a real treat to see her wearing nothing but her underwear dancing.  If you're a feminist or find nearly naked women dancing to disco offensive, this isn't for you.  But for all you men out there, you'll love this show.  Think of it as "In Living Color" meets "The Three Stooges".  My face still hurts from the smile that was plastered there the whole time.  Lastly, I've added a new site to my links.  Rememberfreedom.com Go check it out, it's a good site.     God Bless America

       A TERRORIST TO DIE   This just in from the number one source for news on cable tv, Fox News, sniper John Allen Muhammad has just been given the death penalty.  Justice should be served in about 9-10 years.  That's why the death penalty isn't much of a deterrent to crime, there's no guaranty that the guilty will be put to death.  And even when they are, it about a decade afterwards.  My position is to give them one month to appeal and if that fails, that's it.  You die the next week.  I remember when this whole sniper thing was going down.  The media was all over the place saying that this could only be a lone, angry white guy.  It couldn't be a Muslim or a black guy.  Well, as it turned out, it was two black Muslims.  After that fact came out, that was all that was said about it.  I don't even remember anyone saying anything about them being Muslim at first.  I didn't even know they were Muslim for about a month afterwards.     God Bless America

       IRONY       "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"   This is the inscription that's written on the Statue Of Liberty.  I was looking at pictures of the statue and it got me thinking, how ironic is it that it was the French that gave us the statue.  This symbol of freedom and hope.  Read the inscription.  Does that not discribe the Iraqi people under the iron thumb of Saddam Hussein?  The irony is that the French were opposed to the Iraqi's being freed.  Why?  Because they didn't want to loose their oil and money from Iraq.  Saddam owed millions to France, and that's all they wanted.  Money.  So the next time you want to bitch and moan about the U.S. being in Iraq, read the above.  And the next time someone throws up one of their tired "No Blood For Oil" signs, just think about France and their connection to Iraq.     NEW SITES   Two new sites for you all to visit.  Ted's Blog and Real Clear Politics.  Both Conservative sites.  I don't know about you, but I feel those are the best kind.     God Bless America

       PUFF PIECE   Nothing to report on or give my highly valued opinion on, so I'm going to write this. I bought a Benny Hill DVD today and this Sunday I'm going to get to watch it, 6 hours long, I just don't have the time right now. I will then give my review on it. However, I watched some of it earlier and what I saw was damn funny. Those brits have some of the best comedies. Benny Hill, Monty Python, Black Adder.     God Bless America

       IRAQIS WANT THE U.S. THERE   According to a recent Baghdad University poll, 71% of Iraqis want a U.S. military presence in Iraq.  But that goes against what people like Howard Dean, John Kerry and their ilk are saying.  If you listen to the Leftists around the world, the Iraqis don't want us there at all.  And lord knows they know the Iraqis better than the Iraqis know themselves.     God Bless America

       THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE   I came across this while online and I thought I would share it with you.  Comic legend Red Skeleton wrote this piece some years ago.  Story has it that one of his teachers in school explained the words and the meaning of the Pledge Of Allegiance to his class.  Skeleton later wrote and recorded his recollection of the lecture.  Enjoy.    I  - - Me; an individual; a committee of one.  Pledge  - - Dedicate all of my worldly goods to give without self-pity.  Allegiance  - - My love and my devotion.  To the Flag  - - Our standard; Old Glory ; a symbol of Freedom; wherever she waves there is respect, because your loyalty has given her a dignity that shouts, Freedom is everybody's job.  Of the United  - - That means that we have all come together.  States of America  - - Individual communities that have united into forty-eight great states. Forty-eight individual communities with pride and dignity and purpose. All divided with imaginary boundaries, yet united to a common purpose, and that is love for country.  And to the Republic  - - Republic--a state in which sovereign power is invested in representatives chosen by the people to govern. And government is the people; and it's from the people to the leaders, not from the leaders to the people.  For which it stands, One Nation  - - One Nation--meaning, so blessed by God.  Indivisible  - - Incapable of being divided.  With Liberty  - - Which is Freedom; the right of power to live one's own life, without threats, fear, or some sort of retaliation.  And Justice  - - The principle, or qualities, of dealing fairly with others.  For All  - - For All--which means, boys and girls, it's as much your country as it is mine. And now, boys and girls, let me hear you recite the Pledge of Allegiance:  I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic, for which it stands; one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.    You may notice that 'Under God' isn't in there.  This was done before 'Under God' was put into the Pledge Of Allegiance, which recently people have been getting their panties in a bunch over.  It's there, deal with it.  It's being there doesn't hurt anyone.  Calm down.  If you don't want to say 'Under God', then don't.     God Bless America

       LINK BETWEEN SADDAM AND OSAMA?   If you click  urlLink HERE  you will be taken to a story in the Weekly Standard about a memo that connects Saddam and Osama together as early as 1990.  My question, why is the major media not all over this?  Because they don't want to admit that Bush was right, that's why.  I've seen Fox News cover this, that's about it.

       MICHEAL MOORE'S HYPOCRISY AND THE LEFT'S VIOLENT ATTITUDE   Moorewatch.com has a post about Moore in England during his book tour.  The gist of it is that Moore was at Cambridge giving one of his hate speeches.  Along for the ride he had armed bodyguards to protect his meaty ass.  When asked why he had bodyguards Moore replied "Why do you assume they're security guards? Because they're black?"  The writer of the article says it was because of their shaved heads and earpieces.  Why is it okay for Moore to have bodyguards who are armed with guns around to protect him, but when you or I do it he calls us paranoid gun nuts who is subscribe to the "culture of fear".   Secondly.  In the September issue of NewsMax, the smartest magazine in the country, they have some of their reader’s letters.  By the sound of these letters, I'm scared to death of Liberals.  Below are some excerpts.  "What a gas to call partial-birth abortion a murder.  They fact is that all anti-abortioners should be put to death.  They should be rooted out and burned at stakes."  "Nobody lies more than you stinking Republicans!  This country would be better off if you were all taken out and shot!"  "Don't worry, people like me will be in power when you guys are hopefully dead and gone."   And lastly from someone from Switzerland.  The land of pacifists and peace comes this letter:  "Fuck off American values.  You are the scum of the Earth and the shame of humankind.  PS. We Swiss are much smarter than you silly Americans; we didn't have to kill anyone to have Saddam's gold in our banks."   You also didn't have to kill anyone to get Hitler's gold.  All you had to to was be a coward country and take it up the ass any time anyone tells you to.  Lastly, I would like to welcome a new reader to the thinking mans blog.  Ted, welcome and good luck with your blog.     God Bless America

       BILL O'REILLY TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT?   According to Newsmax, Bill O'Reilly may be contemplating a run for the White House sometime in the future.  The Fox News juggernaut told the Long Island Newsday, "I may take a look. Certainly the option is open if I want it.  But what I want to do over the next few years here is clean up the process. We have the bad guys on the run - no question about that."  He adds, "the country's not interested in an independent candidacy. Maybe in 10 years they will be”.  In the immediate future, O'Reilly has been urged to take on Sen. Hillary Clinton when she comes up for re-election in 2006.  But he has shot that proposal down.    Huh, President O'Reilly?  I'd vote for him.     God Bless America

        "As for Reagan, he's been on his deathbed for the last 10 years. Just die already."   This post doesn't have a name because I couldn't think of one.  The above quote is from someone I correspond with over a web forum.  In a post I said, talking about the hatchet job CBS did with their movie, "The man is on his deathbed, have some respect." and the above was his response.  Wow.  Wishing someone to die.  Why?  I don't know.  What gets me is he's a life loving Liberal.  You know, peace to all, don't kill the murderers and all that.  Yet when it comes to Reagan, "Just die already".  I read this and was speechless for awhile, just stammering.  And I though George "Loony" Clooney saying that Reagan deserved Alzheimer’s because he was president of the NRA was bad, but this is just wrong.  Why do so many people hate Ronald Reagan?  Because he was tough?  Because he didn't take shit from anyone?  Or because he stood up for what he believed whether or not it was popular?  I'm not too sure.  But those are the reasons many people support and defend the man.  And the reason we don't want people like the ones at CBS smearing his name.     God Bless America

       VETERANS DAY      Today is Veterans Day.  The day in which we all should stand up and thank America's Veterans for doing the job that they do and have done.  These people are the true heroes.  They go off to help people who are unable to help themselves and try to bring them a small taste of the freedoms that we enjoy.  This day has a more special meaning because my dad was a veteran of the Korean War.  He was a private in the Army, so today I salute him and every other man and woman who have fought and given their lives for ours and others freedom.  I Pledge Allegiance  To The Flag  Of The United States Of America And To The Republic  For Which It Stands One Nation  Under God Indivisible With Liberty And Justice For All These are words we should all say with pride everyday.  Under God's in it, so get over it .  The world isn't going to end because of it.     God Bless America And Its Veterans

       TERRORISM STRIKES TERRORIST   Last night, Saudi Arabia was attack by a terrorist bomber.  The homicide bomber set off a car bomb in the capital city of Riyadh killing, I believe, at least 17 inside a housing complex.    These terrorist Muslims don't care who they kill, just as long as they get their warped point across.  These people aren't real Muslims.  The Koran doesn't teach killing and hate, it teaches love and acceptance.     God Bless America

       SIGNS OF CHRISTMAS   Christmas is almost here.  A little more than a month away.  I love Christmas.  The whole feeling during this time is amazing.  The weather, the stores full of people the feeling of being with your family.  Nothing tops it.  This post is a list of the signs that Christmas is on it's way.  Enjoy.  The ACLU is starting to bitch and moan about nativity scenes.  The weather is turning colder. I love cold weather.  The Christmas movies are coming out.  ELF is coming to theaters.  The Santa Clause 2 and 8 Crazy Nights are coming out on DVD.   I've started my Christmas shopping.  I got my mom one of those Hamilton Beach Brewstation coffee makers.  The ones without the carafe.  I think she'll like it.  The Salvation Army collectors will be out soon.  Give money, please.  These people need it.  Some aren't as lucky as others.  They need a good Christmas.  The stores are stocked full of their Christmas stuff.  Cards, trees, ornaments, CD's, stockings and lights.  And the number one sign that Christmas is on the way deals with the last reason.  I'm going tomorrow to buy me a new Christmas tree and cards.  I don't like real trees, too much hassle.  I'm buying me one of those pre-lit jobs.  I hope everyone has a nice, safe and happy Holiday season.  Have fun and if you'll be unable to be with your family this year, remember the lyrics from the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song, "and if you can't be with the one you love honey, love the one you're with."      God Bless America

       DESECRATION AND THE U.S. FLAG   This post is about the U.S. flag and what I feel is the desecration of it.  We have people that like to burn the flag in protest to whatever the cause of the day is.  We have people that like to call the flag dumb, stupid or ignorant.  Why?  While it is your constitutional right to do as such, that doesn't make it right.  The Stars and Stripes is what symbolizes what this country stands for.  Young men and women have given their lives in their belief of that flag, and to burn it is the same as spitting in their faces.  People all over the world want to come to this country and are proud to stand up and salute that flag while we have people born here that would rather shit on it as to salute it.  I love the United States flag.  Now, I admit it took the election of Bush and Sep. 11 for me to truly realize what I had.  During the eight years of darkness under the reign of the Clinton regime, I didn't like this country, the military or the flag.  After we got a man in the White House with some integrity, this country started getting better.  Then after Sep. 11, I still didn't get it.  I was still under the mentality of "Why the sudden nation wide patriotism?"  I couldn't understand why people, who had never displayed the flag before, would all of a sudden have one on their shirt, their home or their car.  But I get it now.  It's a reminder that we live in the greatest country on the planet.  I took everything for granted before.  If flying the flag helps people cope with the events of today, who are we to judge them for it?  It helps me.  Everytime I now look at the flag I have hanging right next to my computer, it sends a swelling of pride through my body.  I guess when you start to get older, things just start to come into focus more then they did when your a child or a teenager.     God Bless America And God Bless The U.S. Flag

       A WIN FOR THE CHILDREN   President Bush has sighed the law to ban partial birth abortion today.  A move I support 100%.  We are now a step closer to outlawing this practice of infantile genocide.  The pro-murder groups carry the signs,  Keep Abortion Legal .  Well, I have my own sigh,  Protect The Innocent Little Children .  With the signing of this bill, that’s what President Bush is attempting to do.     God Bless America

       CBS CANCELS "THE REAGANS"   The vast Right-Wing conspiracy has done it.  Conservatives have spoken up and clearly said "We are tired of the networks bashing us, and we're not going to take it anymore".  Because of criticisms and threats of boycotts, CBS has canceled their mini-series  The Reagans .  The movie will now air, uncut, on Showtime.  Good.  This piece of garbage was full of lies and distortions.  Now maybe we'll go after that ABC show  It's All Relative .  A show that finally has a Republican character in a lead role, but of course he has to be a homophobic bigot.  Bias, what bias?     God Bless America

       CBS HAS CHANGE OF "HEART"?   Reportetly, CBS, under intense scrutiny, has edited their upcoming movie about the Reagans.  People who know the Reagans, as well as people who admire them, have threatened to boycott CBS if they went through with their portrayal of the first family.  Reports were that in the script CBS had President Reagan as an insensitive hate-monger who was suffering from Alzheimer’s as early as '83 and the first lady, Nancy, as a drug addicted child abuser.  I hope they've changed it.  To portray these people like this is just a disgrace to a great man and his wife.      God Bless America

       MERRY CHRISTMAS     Well, it's the big day.  Christmas.  The day in which the jolly fat man comes to your home to spread the joy.  No, I'm not talking about Michael Moore.  He's not jolly but he does spread something, however it's not Christmas joy.  No, I'm talking about Santa Claus.  I hope everyone, whether you celebrate Christmas or not, has a safe and happy day.     Merry Christmas

       CHRISTMAS EVE      Well, it's Christmas eve.  The day before the big day.  I thought I would share the all time favorite story with you today.  Please read it and and enjoy.    'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there; The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads; And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, Had just settled down for a long winter's nap, When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below, When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer, With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name; "Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! on Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen! To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!" As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too. And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my hand, and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow; The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath; He had a broad face and a little round belly, That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread; He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night."     God Bless America

       WHERE'S THE BIAS?   Like the Where's The Beef reference?  Some may be too young to remember.  But anyway, I was looking at some blogs this morning and I came across one that I really liked.  I'm trying to get a link for it.  On one of this blogs posts, the author made a great observation.  Remember when Bush's twins were caught drinking?  The media were all over it.  But, Al Gore's son was arrested for possession of  marijuana, reckless driving and suspended from his over priced private school.  Where's the media on this?  I haven't heard anything about this on the news channels.  And something I didn't even know about.  Howard Dean's son was arrested for breaking and entering a home to steal alcohol.  What?  Where was the media on this one.  The only reason I knew about Gore's kid was because I read in on the internet last week.  Well, I guess rich kids will be rich kids.     God Bless America

       NO, NO, NO   I'm getting sick.  I think.  I'm a bit of a hypochondriac about matters like this.  I think I'm getting sick all the time.  But this time I'm really freaked out about it, with this damn flu going around.  I've tried to be really careful and not get it, but apparently not careful enough.  Hopefully it's only a cold.

       SMALL UPDATE   Just one small thing.  I had to change the pic I had for the American Indian Movement.  Having two pics on this site hosted by myimgs.com was eating up my bandwidth too fast.  I had to get rid of one.  I couldn't find the flag, so I had to change the other.  Hopefully, this will help.  I don't want the dreaded   X   poping up when I exceed 20MB.

       TERROR THREAT RAISED TO HIGH      The government has raised the terror threat to High today.  I heard that there’s even talk of raising it to Severe.  Damn terrorists.  I'm already paranoid by this damn flu, now I have to worry about this?  Well, I'm not going to let it ruin my Christmas.  This is a time of joy and celebration.  Not fear and hiding.  But, this is what terrorists do.  They attack during a holiday, just because it's a holiday.     God Bless America

       MORE RANDOM THOUGHTS   Nothing to blog on today and I'm bored.  So I thought I would post some more of my twisted thoughts.  Enjoy  Why do people put so much emphasis on name brands?  I have a niece who absolutely will not wear anything unless it's comes from some overpriced store in the mall.  Abercromie & Fitch and Tommy Hillfiger.  Please, tell me what’s wrong with Wal-Mart?  Nothing.    Why does Apple charge $99 to replace the batteries in the iPod?  Don't they think we paid enough for the iPod itself, $400, and now they want us to pay another $100 every year for new batteries.  Bull crap.  Is the bald eagle not the most magnificent animal on the planet?  Well, aside from a 20-year-old Asian woman.   Speaking of which, why are Asian woman so much more beautiful than other women?  Are these blogs not the most asinine things on Earth?  If so, then why can't I stop posting on it?  I want a 65 Mustang Fastback.  Cherry red with black interior.  Damn fine car.  I also want a Hummer.  Not that butt ugly H2, I want the H1.  All black.  Hulk Hogan will forever be a hero to me.  Why do people need to access the internet from their phones?  That's all for now, I don't want to run out of things to complain about.  I may need more before too long.     God Bless America

       TWO THINGS   First off, I worked things out with Jake.  I wrote him a sappy e-mail and he called me a wuss, and I put his link back up.  I had to be the big man and put my frustration aside.  Secondly, a little Christmas gift for my readers.  I’ll be changing the pic everyday, along with the countdown, to a new dream Mrs. Claus.  Even if you don't celebrate Christmas doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.     God Bless America

       KISS MICHAEL JACKSON GOODBYE   Well, Wacko Jacko has been charged with 7, count them, 7, counts of child molestation.  Yet he has been given his passport back so he can go to England for Christmas.  What the bloody hell?  This is where the kiss jacko goodbye comes in.  All he has to do is hop the Chunnel to France and we'll never see him again.  ala Roman Polanski.  Well, that's what Liberal leaning courts in California do. If Jackson comes back, I'll be genuinely surprised.     God Bless America

       FOR ALL THE GEEKS      All you geeks out there, you know who you are, are probably familiar with TechTV.  If not, then you don't have digital cable or satellite.  It's a channel that deals with anything tech.  Computers, mp3 players, robots, anything.  They also have an uncanny ability to hire the most jaw dropping women.  Here's a pic of one of their hosts, Cat Schwartz.  When I think of the TechTV girls, this is what I've pictured.  Just one word.  Damn.     God Bless America

       HELP FROM MY READERS   I need some help from my readers.  If you'll notice the flag and skull shield on this site, well I have them hosted on myimgs.com.  Myimgs.com is an okay hosting site, but they only allow a 20MB bandwidth per month.  Already this month, I'm up to 13MB.  Almost at my max.  If you'll go down to the bottom of the page, you'll notice a counter.  It's over 100 already since I put it on a couple of weeks ago.  Thank you all.  If anyone knows of an image hosting site, free, that allows a larger bandwidth, or if you have one and are willing to host the pictures please contact me.  Thanks.     God Bless America

       TRUTH STARING YOU IN THE FACE      I was watching a documentary this morning called  In The Last Days .  It followed 5 surviving victims of the holocaust that Hitler brought upon the Jewish people during W.W.II.  Very moving film.  It talked about what really went on in the concentration camps at that time.  One woman who was in one of these camps said that movies that deal with the subject don't even come close to describing what it was really like.  It brought me to tears watching this and listening to the stories of these people.  And it made me sick to my stomach to know that some in this world see George W. Bush as a bigger evil then Hitler or think that the holocaust was fake.  Look at the pictures above.  Just stare at them for awhile.  Yeah, the man that caused this wasn't so bad.  But Bush, oh man, watch out for him.  Because he's told the American military to go into Afgahanastan and Iraq to kill the Arabs and Muslim people, steal their oil and enslave them.     God Bless America

       OFF THE DAMNED DEEP END   As you can see, I've taken the link to Jake's Blog, formerly Gohan's Blog, off.  I can't, in good conscience, leave it up.  As the title says, he’s gone off the deep end.  In his latest  urlLink diatribe  he sides with Howard Dean in saying that President Bush knowingly let over 2,000 innocent humans die on September 11.  I just can't support that.  It's one thing to say that Bush makes Hitler look like a saint, but saying, and even more terrifying, believing, that Bush let this happen is over the line.  That's where Howard Dean is trying to take the Democratic Party.  If you don’t believe Howard Dean is a dangerous man, you need to open your eyes.     God Bless America

       NOT ALL BAD   I criticize the French.  But it's not the French people I don't like, it's the government.  The French government are cowards more so than the public.  However, they could have fought harder during W.W.II.  But not everything about the French is bad.  They did give us the Statue of Liberty.  But more importantly, they gave us Jean Reno.  Reno is a great action star.  Born in Morocco, he moved to France when he was 17.  So I guess he's not really French.  Cheers mate.  But he lives in France.  With movies like Mission: Impossible, Godzilla, Wasabi and my all time favorite, The Professional, I guess it's easy to see why he's the best thing to come out of France in a long while.

       TWO THINGS   Two things to do right now.   First.  Here's a link to a funny Mallard Filmore comic strip.  I like Mallard, it's got to be the best comic out there.  This strip deals with Howard Dean's pandering to us rednecks down here in the south.  Very funny.  urlLink Mallard   And secondly.  People who read this blog and have e-mailed me in the past, could you send me a short message.  I've finally decided to start using an address book and I need your addresses.

       NEW LINK   I've added a new picture link for you all.  If you don't know who Leonard Peltier is, he's a prisoner in Leavenworth who is being held on the murders of two FBI agents.  The thing is, he didn't do it.  He's a scapegoat for the government.  Go to the site and read up on the facts of the case.  Then I urge you to write President Bush and ask him to grant Peltier a full pardon.  I also suggest that you pick up a CD.  Robbie Robertson's "Contact From The Underground World Of Red Boy" and listen to the song  Sacrifice  to hear the story from Mr. Peltier himself.  In case you don't get the CD, here's what Peltier says on the song,   My name is Leonard Peltier I am a Lakota and Anishnabe And I am living in the United States penitentiary Which is the swiftest growing Indian reservations in the country  I have been in prison since 1976 For an incident that took place on the Oglala-Lakota Nation There was a shoot-out between members of the American Indian Movement And The FBI and the local Sheriffs State Troopers Two agents were killed and one Indian was murdered  Three of us were charged with the deaths of the FBI agents My co-defendants were found not guilty by reasons of self-defense My case was separated and I was found guilty before a jury of non-Indian people The prosecutor stated that they did not know who killed their agents Nor did he know what participation Leonard Peltier may have played in it But someone has to pay for the crime  There's a lot of nights that I lay in my cell And I can't understand why this hell this hell and this terror That I have been going through for twenty-one years hasn't ended.  But yet I know in my heart that someone has to pay sacrifice To make things better for our people The sacrifice I have made when I really sit down to think about it Is nothing compared to what our people a couple hundred years ago Or fifty years ago or twenty-five years ago have made Some gave their lives Some had to stand there and watch their children die in their arms So the sacrifice I have made is nothing compared to those  I've gone too far now to start backing down I don't give up Not 'til my people are free will I give up And if I have to sacrifice some more Then I sacrifice some more   It's not only the story he tells, but the way he tells it, that has a lot of impact.  There is also a movie,  Incident at Ogalala , that you should pick up.  He needs our help.  He doesn't deserve to die in prison for a crime he didn't commit.     God Bless America

       CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH   I was watching Fox News earlier, and they were talking about the capture of Saddam.  And something hit me.  Saddam and French president Jacques Chirac have had some sort of relationship for something like 30 years.  When Saddam was found, he came out of his hole and gave up without a fight wanting to strike a deal.  Sound familiar?  Looks like he not only modeled himself after Hammurabi and Hitler, he also modeled himself after the French.     God Bless America

       HITLER -VS- BUSH   Who's worse?  Adolf Hitler or George W. Bush.  Well, conventional wisdom says Hitler's worse.  But don't tell that to liberals.  They seem to think that George W. Bush is the greater evil.  So let's compare the two shall we?   Hitler  Ordered the genocide of the Jewish people.  Had millions of Jews killed in concentration camps.  They were tortured, experimented on and starved to death.  After he lost WW II, he went underground and killed himself.   Bush  Hasn't ordered the genocide of any people.  Hasn't killed, or ordered the deaths of millions of people.  No concentration camps, tortures, exterminations or starvations.  Well, I guess conventional wisdom wins out once again.  Now, let’s compare Saddam to Hitler.   Hitler  All the above stuff   Saddam  Either killed, or ordered the deaths of hundreds of thousands of his own countrymen, women and children.  Use sarin and mustard gas on the Kurds in the 80's.  Gave refuge to terrorist over the years.  When found yesterday, he was hiding underground.  Too bad he didn't kill himself like his idol Adolf Hitler.  Now, who's more like Hitler?     God Bless America

       CHANGES AFOOT   As you may have noticed, something's different.  I changed the color scheme.  The red, white and blue scheme was getting kind of old.  Maybe even a little sophomoric.  I wanted something that looked a little more professional.  I looked at template after template and couldn't find what I wanted.  So I just decided to change the colors of this on.  I had to start from scratch.  I'm not too good at HTML, and it took awhile to get this right.  But I like.  I would really like to know what you all think of it.  Write me and tell me.

       RANDOM THOUGHTS   Netpal  urlLink Gohan  gave me this idea from his latest post.  It was so good, I thought I would steal it from him.     Kind of says it all, don't it.   Is it me, or is the economy getting better?  No.  It's not just me.  It is getting better.  I want to know who Photshopped the cover of Micheal Moore's book "Dude, Where's My Fat", I mean "Country".  That was good work.  Who is Al Gore trying to cross by endorsing Dean?  The Democratic establishment or the Clintons?  Either way, I wouldn't want a two time presidential looser on my side.  Seems like a jinx.  Is  AC/DC  not the greatest band on the entire planet?    I'm thinking about upgrading my CPU to a 2.6GHz, but don't have the money.  Why are computer parts so damn expensive?  I love America.  We are without a doubt the best country there has ever been.  Gen. Wes Clark is the Clinton's puppet.  For further proof.  He's thinking about asking Hillary Clinton to be his running mate.  Some think the Republicans are scared of Hillary Clinton.  More specifically, the prospect of her becoming president.  Here's the truth.  It's not Hillary we're scared of.  It's the thought of another Clinton in the White House.  We've already had one fuck it up, we don't need another.  I wish Roger Waters and David Gilmour would put their differences aside and reform Pink Floyd.  A new album from them would easily shot right up to number one.  Why do some think Zel Miller has sold out.  Just because he sides with President Bush, some think he's double-crossed them.  Who ever said you had to agree with everything your party says.  Same with Joe Lieberman.  Have a very Happy Chanukah and very Merry Christmas.      God Bless America

       TO THE COWARDS GO THE SPOILS   Now that Saddam is gone and Iraq needs help, people want in.  France, Germany, Canada and Russia all want in on the rebuilding of Iraq.  They want to take part in getting some the lucrative contracts.  Germany and Canada have been more helpful as of late.  They've send money to help with the rebuilding, but France and Russia have stood in our way every step of the way.  I say fuck France and Russia.  They've done nothing to help, why the hell should they benefit from the yellow streaks running down their backs?  And now the U.N. is calling for unity.  Where were they a year ago when we asked them for help?  They snubbed their noses at us hoping we would fail so they could say, "We told you so".  But now that we've succeeded and Saddam is gone, now they want to "help".  Yeah, help their wallets.  France, Russia and the U.N. can all go to hell.  Unless you've help, you deserve nothing.

       AM I IN THE WRONG PARTY?   I was reading one of my fellow bloggers post, click Ted's Blog, and at the end of it he wrote "Ah the joy of being a 'rich' Republican".  And it got me thinking about the stereotypes of political parties.  I'm poor.  I'm blue collar.  I'm mixed raced.  I'm not too smart.  Damn, I should be a Democrat.  But I'm a Republican.  Why is that.  Isn't the Democratic party suppose to be talking directly to me?  How come I'm not receiving their message?  Then again, I've always been one to go against the grain.

       OUR NEXT PRESIDENT?      This is who some want as our next president?  Dear God in heaven I hope not.  Look at the man.  He's full of hate and contempt.  He sticks his foot in his mouth so much he call Dr. Scholls when he wants to eat out for dinner.  And the media just lets him slip by virtually unscathed.  He accused President Bush of knowing that the terrorist attacks on Sep. 11 would happen.  He refers to Russia as the "Soviet Union".  The Soviet Union hasn't existed for over a decade.  If Bush had done something like that, people would be calling him dumb, stupid or a retard.  When Bush was running in 2000, people were all over the place saying that he didn't have any experience.  That he didn't know how to be president.  Well, what experience does Dean have?  Where's the criticism of Dean on this subject?  I keep hearing that Dean has the White House worried or running scared.  What?  People really think Bush is sitting in a corner sucking his thumb scared of Howard Dean?  No.  Sure Dean could win, I think he will personally, but the White House isn't scared of him.  I'm going to make a prediction right now.  I want someone to copy this and save it somewhere.  After the election, if Dean wins, we will see the Democrats go berserk.  Gloating, bragging and whole nine yards.  There's sore losers, as I'm sure some Republicans will be, but there are also bad winners.  I've already excepted this.  I'm preparing myself for it.  And if Bush looses, I have a quote I like to say.  "A great leader is measured not by doing what's popular, but by doing what's right".  And that's what Bush did.  Or one by Churchill, "A great leader is someone who is willing to put everything on the line, even if it costs him everything".     God Bless America

       OFFENSIVE   I was watching Fox News this morning.  They had two people talking about Christmas trees.  The woman on there was bitching and moaning about how Christmas trees, and the decorations in general, offend her.  She was saying that they shouldn't be in public display.  That they should only be displayed in our homes or churches.  She went on about how the Christmas tree offends Jews.  The other one, a Jew himself, kept trying to get it through her head that he wasn't offended by Christmas decorations.  But that he was offended by the small group of people who don't celebrate Christmas trying to tell those that do celebrate it what to do.  So, because a few people are offended by Christmas decorations, we should take them down?  Well, I'll tell you what offends me.  Painting a picture of the Virgin Mary and then covering it with elephant shit.  Now because that offended so many people, why didn't they take that down?  Rap music and the message it sends offends a lot of people.  Why don't they get rid of it?  Lastly, we're getting our first snowfall of the season today.  As the song says, "I'm dreaming of a white Christmas".  Come on snow.     God Bless America

       GORE SHOWS HIS SUPPORT   It's just been announced.  The looser of the 2000 presidential election has just thrown his support behind the hopeful looser of the 2004 election, Howard Dean.  I guess this just shows that Gore isn't a Clinton puppet like many other powerful Democrats.  If he were, he would have thrown his support behind the Clinton puppet of a candidate, Clark.  But you have to wonder why Dean and not his 2000 running mate Joe Lieberman.  Well, I’ll tell you why.  Because Dean is ahead in the polls.  If John Kerry or John Edwards were ahead, then Gore would support them.  That’s the mentality of many Democrats in the election.  It’s only about beating Bush.    KERRY GETS NASTY   John Kerry, while giving an interview to Rolling Stone magazine said "Did I expect George Bush to fuck it up as badly as he did?" Now, I have no problem with foul language.  Shit, I say them all the damned time.  I also know that presidents use them.  Their only human after all.  But what I don't like is Kerry's obvious attempt to pander to young people.  I guess he thinks that by saying Bush fucked something up he's going to get the Gen X and Y vote.  Sorry, but we all saw through the attempt you Frankenstein looking motherfucker.  I know, I know.  Insult.  Just had to get that one in.  Hey, hey, JFK, how many babies did you kill today?  Another insult, I know.  Damn, I'm just full of piss and vinegar today.  I don’t mean any disrespect to any Vietnam Vet.  What I’m talking about his Kerry’s support of abortion.    TEENS MORE CONSERVATIVE TODAY   A study shows that teens today are more conservative on social issues.  I can't find a copy of the article, but I'm sure if watch any of the 24-hour news networks one of them will show the story.  That's good news.  Maybe there's still some hope left after all.

       THE DAY OF INFAMY       "Yesterday, Dec. 7, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy - the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan."   That's how President Roosevelt's speech began when he addressed Congress on Dec. 8, 1941.  Today is December 7, 2003.  The 62 year anniversary of the attack.  Today is a day in which we should all bow our heads and give a silent prayer to the men and women who were lost on this day 62 years ago.   urlLink  HERE'S   a good site that has a lot of info about that day.  I recomend you all take a look at it.     God Bless America

       EMINEM   First off, let me just say I HATE RAP.  Rap is the scourge of all music, if you can call rap music that is.  Anyway, white-boy rapper Eminem has a new song out in which he says that he wishes President Bush was dead.  First he had a video in which he kills VP Cheney and now this.  Sure he has his first amendment rights, but freedom of speech doesn't mean you can say ANYTHING you want.  Or does it?  If it does, then I am going to exorcise my freedom of speech.  I hope someone abducts Feminem one day, ties his hands behind his back, shoves a rusty piece of barbedwire up his ass as fast and as hard as they can and pulls it out ever so slowly.  Over and over and over and over and over and over again.  Just exorcising my freedom speech.  Damn that felt good, I think I'll do it again.  I hope someone takes Martin Sheen and super glues a piece of duct tape to his mouth while bitch-slapping him.  I hope someone takes Madonna, shoves a grenade down her mouth and runs like hell.  Harsh, yes, but it's freedom of speech.  Unlike Eminem, I don't really wish any of these things would happen.  Except maybe the duct tape on Sheen.  He should have left that on.     God Bless America & George W. Bush

       BABES AGAINST BUSH   Saw a site on a few news shows today, thought I would share it with you.   urlLink Babes Against Bush .  It's a bunch of half-naked models hocking their Anti-Bush calendar.  When you go there, the home page has something on there that I find damn amusing.  "you don't have to be beautiful to hate George W. Bush, but you've sure got to be ugly to like him".  Damn, it's finally been confirmed.  I'm ugly.  Calling people who like Bush ugly.  Sounds like an insult to me.  And we all know that insults are the language of the ignorant.  It's the man backed in a corner that lashes out in anger.  So this is what the Dems have been reduced to?  The economy is getting better.  The majority of the people support Bush's actions in Iraq.  So they have to use nice looking, naked, women to try and get their message across.  It's actually ingenious.  If they bring out a calendar like this against Dean after he wins the nomination, you can damn well bet I'm going to have one on my wall.  One last note, read the reasons why Bush sucks.  I'll give you my three favorite reasons they have.   22. Fox News .  President Bush sucks because of Fox News.  That’s a good one.  I didn’t now Bush had anything to do with Fox News.   89. Supports nuclear power .  Now aren't these the same people who love the French?  And don't the French use nuclear power?  And  94. Can't drive a Segway .  Damn, I didn't know riding one of those was a pre-requisite for being president of the United States.     God Bless America

       POLICE BRUTALITY?   You're damn right it's police brutality.  Brutality against the police.  No doubt you've seen the video of Cincinnati police officers attempting to arrest Nathaniel Jones.  If you watch the video, you will see Jones attack the police first.  When the officers finally got him to the ground and attempted to arrest him, Jones was still fighting.  Some may call that a beating, but that's how police officers are trained.  Subdue the person any way possible.  Did you see the size of the man?  He was huge.  It took 6 officers to finally get him down.  Jones later died on route to the hospital.  It was found that he had an enlarged heart and that his blood contained cocaine and PCP, or "angel dust".  When you're on PCP, you feel no pain and are almost unstoppable.  It's just another example of people attacking police officers because the suspect was black.  If it had been a 400 plus pound white man fighting the way Jones was, the police would have acted just the same.  The police officers were being attacked by a man that could kill any one of them pretty damn easily.  What did you expect them to do.  Sit back and let him.  Watch the video.  The officers continued to try to get Mr. Jones to place his hands behind his back.  And at no time did they strike his head.  They were not trying to kill or harm Jones, only to arrest him.  He was belligerent and uncooperative.     God Bless America

       HOWARD DEAN NOT A FAN OF FREE SPEECH   On a recent appearance on MSNBC's show "Hardball" the Democratic presidential front-runner told host Chris Matthews that he wants "break up" the Fox News Channel along with other conservative news outlets owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch.  Dean went on to say  "Eleven companies in this country control 90 percent of what ordinary people are able to read and watch on their television" .  I guess Dean's never heard of the countless other news channels, broadcast channels, news papers, NPR or the magazines that are available on the news stands all over the country.  Matthews then asked Dean  "Would you break up Fox? ... Rupert Murdoch has 'The Weekly Standard.' It has got a lot of other interests. It has got the New York Post. Would you break it up?"   To which Dean responded  "On ideological grounds, absolutely yes" .  He wants to get rid of Fox News just because it's a Conservative news channel?  I guess Dean just doesn't like people to have freedom of speech in this country, unless that speech leans to the left.  To read the entire article, click  urlLink HERE . There's a good part about how when Dean realized that he was starting to put his foot in his mouth, again, he backpedaled.     God Bless America

       WHO IS THE DARLING OF THE INTERNET?   For the past few months we've been hearing how Howard Dean is the darling of the internet fund raising.  How he's raised so much money for his campaign over the net.  But in a recent, I believe MSNBC, story, I heard that President Bush has raised 6 times the amount Gov. Dean has over the internet.  So far for his re-election campaign, President Bush has raised somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 million dollars over the internet.  So I ask again, who is the darling of the internet?

There's a congressman on there that wants the term "illegal immigrant" band because he feels it's offensive.  Can you guess where this congressman is from?  That's right San Francisco, California.  The mecca of loony land.  He wants the new PC term to be "undocumented worker" because "how can a human be illegal?".  I'm am so proud to be a Republican, now more than ever.

       FUN FACT   I thought Howie D. was the darling of the internet.  But on Blogs For Bush they have lists of bloggers that have signed up for each candidates blogrolls.    Dean has 88 blogs listed  Clark has 37 blogs listed Kerry has 18 blogs listed Bush has, get this, 250 blogs listed  It appears that Bush has a little bit bigger grassroots community.  I found an article that may explain why.  It's old, 2002, but it's still good.   urlLink Richard Poe   One last thing on Blogs For Bush.  They have a post up about a Muslim group Wes Clark sought support from.  The only this is that group was under investigation by the FBI.  But of course the Gen. didn't know that.

If your a Zeppelin fan, you may not recognize the song.  That's because it was written and recorded in 1994 for the MTV Unledded special.  It's also on the their CD  No Quarter: Jimi Page & Robert Plant Unledded .  It was recorded live in Morocco, so it has that Moroccan/Middle Eastern sound to it.  Great song.  You should by the CD, great CD.  But if you don't want the whole CD, go to your iTunes or Buy Music and buy the 99 cent song.

       SHARPTON AT THE DEBATE   I didn't even know there was a debate tonight.  I just happened to turn it to MSNBC and see it.  Anyway, back to the topic.  I just saw Al Sharpton and his ranting about how Bush lied about WMD's in Iraq, and he just spewed forth the lie about how Bush said Saddam was an imminent threat to America.  How many times do we have to keep telling these morons that Bush never said that.  What's more, I was waiting for Tom Brokaw, a serious newsman, to correct Sharpton.  But he just threw it to a commercial instead.    On a sidenote, don't you just love it when candidates pimp out people for their own gain.  Kerry did it with his Vietnam buddy and Sharpton just did it.  Talking about a soldiers funeral he presided over.  He made sure the people of SC knew that it took place right in SC.  It's what's know as a "cheap pop".  Mention the town or state and people will identify with you.  But's it gets real tasteless when you pimp out someone who has died.

       WEBSITE OF TERRORISTS   We've all heard about the terrorist group known as A.L.F, Animal Liberation Front, well here's a group that's very similar to A.L.F.  They say their not in affiliation with A.L.F, but it wouldn't supprise me if they were.     urlLink animalliberation.net    Even their front page is scary looking.  A black and white picture of a man dressed like somekind of undercover op cammando in a movie holding a baby pig.  They even tout attacks that have taken place on people and businesses like KFC, fur shops and even farms.  These cowards won't even show their faces.  Kind of reminds me of the KKK with their hoods.  I'm thinking about added a new list of links called Terrorist with sites like these.  These are some scary people.

       BUSH, WMD AND IMPEACHMENT   I had to post on this.  Fmr. chief weapons inspector David Kay has said that Saddam didn't have WMD's.  This has caused the grumblings of the left on the impeachment of Bush to get a little louder.  But in all fairness, these grumblings have been around since he won in 2000.  They want Bush impeached for "lying to the American people about WMD's".  I was looking at some of the many sites dedicated to the subject, and many don't even list why they feel he should be impeached.  I find that kind of funny.  Another argument is they make is they want us to believe Bush said that Saddam  was  a threat.  When he actually said that we need to stop him  before  be became a threat.  If you ask me, this is nothing more than sour grapes.  Their hero "Bubba" was impeached for lying to the American people, not to mention under oath, so now they want revenge.  Kind of like Ed Asner and his quote about "we got Rush, next we get Hannity".  If they want to go after someone for lying about Saddam and WMD's, they should go after "Bubba" and the U.N. as well.  But I just don't see that happening.  To be honest, I don't care if Saddam had WMD's or not.  He had to be taken out for the mass genocide he was commiting.

In it he was pimping the guy who's life he saved in Nam.  There's a Heineken ad that shows dance teachers trying to teach an elephant and a jackass  to dance.  Two guys are watching it and one says, "It's going to be a long year".  I have to agree.  By the way, the elephant was dancing, the jackass just stood there.

       RANDOM THOUGHTS 3   Okay kiddies, it's time for the third installment of Random Thoughts.  The post that takes you deep into my twisted mind.    Reports are that Bush has a 52% favorable rating in California.  Could he win there in November?  Why do people treat athletes like their supreme beings?  Why can't pets live longer?  Here's a "scientific" study I did.  Single men tend to have female pets while married men tend to have male pets.  The same for women.  Single women tend to have male pets and married women tend to have female pets.  Don't believe me, take a look for yourself.  Why is this?

       THANK YOU   I just had an overwelming urge to post this.  I don't know if any of my readers have ever, are currently or are planning to join the armed services.  But if so, I just want to say thank you.  You are the people who put your lives on the line for people you don't even know.  Some may even dispise you for doing it or even for just being an American, but know that you have at least one person whow supports you 100%.  I know this sound cliched and maybe a little phoney, but I'm being totally honest.  You are the some of the true heroes this world has.  There's a poem I found that I really like and I thought I would share it here.     I watched the flag pass by one day. It fluttered in the breeze A young Marine saluted it, and then He stood at ease.  I looked at him in uniform So young, so tall, so proud With hair cut square and eyes alert He'd stand out in any crowd.  I thought, how many men like him Had fallen through the years? How many died on foreign soil? How many mothers' tears? How many Pilots' planes shot down? How many foxholes were soldiers' graves? No, Freedom is not free.  I heard the sound of taps one night, When everything was still. I listened to the bugler play And felt a sudden chill.  I wondered just how many times That taps had meant "Amen" When a flag had draped a coffin of a brother or a friend.  I thought of all the children, Of the mothers and the wives, Of fathers, sons and husbands With interrupted lives.  I thought about a graveyard at the bottom of the sea Of unmarked graves in Arlington. No, Freedom isn't free!!  God Bless America!

       NH PRIMARY   The NH primary is over and done with, and yet again Frankenstein, I mean John Kerry, has won.  The totals aren't in yet, but as of right now this is how it breaks down:   Kerry - 38% Dean - 26% Clark - 13% Edwards - 12% Lieberman - 9%  I don't know about Sharpton or Kucinich, but I'm guessing they got 1% or less.  This has turned into a four man race between Kerry, Dean, Clark and Edwards.  I think it's about time for Lieberman, Sharpton and Kucinich to drop out.  I don't see Lieberman dropping out just yet, but I have a feeling that Sharpton and/or Kucinich will be dropping out before SC.  I also said the same thing after Iowa and was wrong, so it's a guess not a prediction.  I have to say that I'm feeling a little better about November now.  When Dean was the front runner, I felt he had the best chance of beating Bush.  And I though he would, too.  However, it looks as though Kerry may just be the Dems nomination and I don't think Kerry has a chance, right now, of beating Bush.    Another little piece of news.  Earlier today Edwards was asked if he would consider running as Kerry's VP.  He flat out said no, let's see if he keeps his word or if he's just another politician.

       LINK-O-RAMA   I've been promising some new links and here they are.  First up is a new blog.  Probably the best looking blog I've seen.  Freedom Of Thought.  Second.  I've added a new section of links.  My heroes links.  Links to the different branches of military in America.  If you take a look at Freedom Of Thought, you'll see that she has military links up as well.  But I didn't steal her idea.  I've been meaning to put them up, but seeing them there got my but into gear.  I've also added a link to a POW/MIA site.  Now this idea was partly taken from FOT, as well as the show  American Chopper , awesome show by the way.  If you watch the show, you know that they've been working on a POW/MIA bike.  So those two things put the idea in my head.  There's also a link to firedonations.com.  A fund set up for the familes of firefighters lost in action.  I'm trying to find a similer site for Police officers.  Third.  I've added a link to a site called Bowling for Truth.  It's a site that exposes the lies of Michael Moore in his books and mockumentries.  And lastly a link that has real meaning for me.  The link to koreanwar.org.  My dad was serving in the Army during the Korean War, so I put this up as a tribute to him.  It's a site that's trying to keep the memory of the Korean War alive, but their having trouble.  They need more donations to stay online.  There, you can find men that you served with during the War that you may of lost contact with, look up the POW/MIA's and learn more about the Forgotten Conflict.

       KERRY TO SELL OUT AMERICA?    urlLink Newsmax  has an interesting article on John Kerry.  It talks about an interview he gave in 1970.  In the article, Kerry says that it was time to "almost eliminate CIA activity".  And that U.S. troops should only be used under the command of the U.N.  It also talks about the claims Kerry made about troops in Vietnam, and how he has no proof to back up these claims.  This is going to sound harsh, and even a little mean, but what a piece of crap John Kerry is.  To think that American troops should, or would ever, be under the control of the U.N.  Could you imagine how shitty our military would be if it were under the control of the U.N.?    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

As for the rest: Edwards - 82% Lieberman - 79% Dean - 66% Kucinich - 53% It didn't show my results for Clark or Sharpton    NEW LINK   I've added a new link to the site.

       REVIEW TIME   Nothing in the news to talk about right now, so I though I would review a couple of movies and a CD.    Johnny English   This was a funny movie.  Rowan Atkinson, Mr. Bean, as a British spy.  He's more lucky than he is good, but he has his moments.  Not a bad movie at all.  Great action, great comedy and Natalie Imbruglia.  Can't stand her music, but she's hot.  Best line in the film is when Atkinson says, "In my opinion, the only thing the French should be allowed to host is an invasion".  Great stuff.  Go and rent this.  3 out of 5.    Freddy -vs- Jason   This was a kick ass movie.  The best one for the franchises in some time.  Forget the horrible Jason X, this movie will restore your faith in un-killable killer.  I won't give too much of it away, but both get their asses kicked by one another.  Freddy's dream world is the best it's been in some time.  I'm torn between renting and buying it.  I'll let you choose that.  4 out of 5.    Delbert McClinton Live   If you love the blues, get this CD.  2 disks of smokin' music.  It's just good, old fashion, toe tappin' music with a couple of love ballads thrown in.  Go out and buy this.  5 out of 5.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       TRUTH ON BUSH'S AWOL CHARGE   We all saw Wes Clark defend, while weaseling his way out of answering the question about Michael Moore's tidbit about Bush being a deserter.  Newsmax has an article up that talks about the facts.  Here's the entire piece.  Plagiarism , I know, but I don't think they'll care.   "Did President Bush "desert" the military, as radical filmmaker Michael Moore insists he did?  Presidential candidate Gen. Wesley Clark suggested during New Hampshire's presidential debate Thursday night that the facts on whether Bush ran out on his National Guard unit in 1972 and 1973 are in dispute.   But in the months before the 2000 presidential election, the New York Times pretty much demolished this Democratic Party urban legend, a myth that first surfaced in its sister paper, the Boston Globe.   "For a full year, there is no record that Bush showed up for the periodic drills required of part-time guardsmen," the Globe insisted in May 2000, in a report Moore currently cites on his Web site to rebut ABC newsman Peter Jennings' debate challenge to Clark that the story is "unsupported by the facts."  "I don't know whether [Moore's desertion charge] is supported by the facts or not," Clark replied "I've never looked at it."  The Times did, however, look at it, and found that Bush had indeed served during part of the time the Globe had him AWOL - and later made up whatever time he missed after requesting permission for the postponement.   In July 2000 the Times noted that Bush's chief accuser in the Globe report, retired Gen. William Turnipseed, had begun to back away from his story that Bush never appeared for service during the time in question.  "In a recent interview," said the Times, "[Turnipseed] took a tiny step back, saying, 'I don't think he did, but I wouldn't stake my life on it.'" In fact, military records obtained by the Times showed that Turnipseed was wrong and that the Globe had flubbed the story.   "A review by The Times showed that after a seven-month gap, he appeared for duty in late November 1972 at least through July 1973," the paper noted on Nov. 3, 2000.  The Times explained:  "On Sept. 5, 1972, Mr. Bush asked his Texas Air National Guard superiors for assignment to the 187th Tactical Recon Group in Montgomery [Alabama] 'for the months of September, October and November,'" so Bush could manage the Senate campaign of Republican Winton Blount.  "Capt. Kenneth K. Lott, chief of the personnel branch of the 187th Tactical Recon Group, told the Texas commanders that training in September had already occurred but that more training was scheduled for Oct. 7 and 8 and Nov. 4 and 5."   After the Bush AWOL story had percolated for months, Col. Turnipseed finally remembered another glitch in his story: the fact that National Guard regulations allowed Guard members to miss duty as long as it was made up within the same quarter.  And, in fact - according to the Times - that's what Bush did.  "A document in Mr. Bush's military records," the paper said, "showed credit for four days of duty ending Nov. 29 and for eight days ending Dec. 14, 1972, and, after he moved back to Houston, on dates in January, April and May."  The paper found corroboration for the document, noting, "The May dates correlated with orders sent to Mr. Bush at his Houston apartment on April 23, 1973, in which Sgt. Billy B. Lamar told Mr. Bush to report for active duty on May 1-3 and May 8-10."  Yet another document obtained by the Times blew the Bush AWOL story out of the water.   It showed that Bush served at various times from May 29, 1973, through July 30, 1973 - "a period of time questioned by The Globe," the Times sheepishly admitted."   Don't be looking for this part to come out of Moore's or Clark's mouth any time soon.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       2 QUICK ITEMS   First, I want to comment on a post by fellow blogger  urlLink Ted .  You're right, Wes Clark has gotten weirder.  To know what I'm talking about, go read his post.  Secondly.  I'm thinking about taking my "support" back from Edwards.  Read my 1/19 post  He's Got My Support .  I stated that Edwards hasn't felt the need to spread lies and smear others.  Well, in his recent ad playing here, I don't know if it's playing in your area yet, Edwards talks about his 2 Americas theory.  In one part he says that there's two tax systems.  One in which the rich pay less and one in which the poor pay more.  That's an outright lie.  The rich in this country pay more percentage wise as well as dollar wise.  Let's see, my mom makes around $20,000 a year and pays nothing in taxes.  She get a refund from both state and federal.  Yet someone like Bill Gates, who makes billions, probably pays something like 50% or more a year.  Who's paying more?  But like I say, there's no such thing as an honest politician.  And if one says he is, there your proof.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       SAD NEWS      Sad news to talk about today.  Bob Keeshan, who entertained and taught millions of children over 30 as Captain Kangaroo, has passed away.  His family is only saying that his death is due to a long running illness.    I loved Captain Kangaroo.  My generation is probably the last one who really knows who he was.  With Mr. Green Jeans, Bunny Rabbit and Mr. Moose, I watched his show almost religiously.  I loved it when the ping-pong balls would fall from the sky.  Along with Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street, Capitan Kangaroo was one of my earliest teachers.  Bob Keeshan will be greatly missed.

       THE DEBATE      Well, tonight was the only debate between the Dems before the NH primary.  Was anyone else struggling to stay awake?  These things are so damn boring.  I'll try to remember as much as I can of what I saw.  First, let me commend Joe Lieberman for his continued support of the War In Iraq.  He continues to call it a just war, which it was, and when he said that "sometimes you have to stand up for what's right, even if it's not popular", I just had to nod my head in agreement.  The only Dem with guts to support the removal of Saddam.  I thought it was kind of funny watching John Edwards try and show what he knows about Islam.  Stumbling around like that was great.  Howie D. playing the race card by bringing up something about shipping Bush back to Crawford because he mentioned quotas, I missed the whole thing.  If I'm not mistaken, did Dean, in his own way, elude to Bush being a racist?  Isn't it also my understanding that it's Dems who support the racist program called "affirmative action"?  Clark supporting Moore's remark about Bush being a deserter, while ignoring "Skislope" Dean who's standing right next to him and "Bubba" Clinton.  Well, he can't slam the Puppet master.    "I will never start a war or conduct a war because we want to, I will go to war because we have to"  Jonh Kerry Mr. Kerry, we had to go to war.  Like President Bush said in the 2003 State Of The Union, we have to stop Saddam  before  he becomes an immediate threat.  Take a lesson for Joe Leiberman.  And what's up with that thing he does with his tounge?  Anyone else notice that?  Anyway, another uneventful debate.  No one did anything to help or hurt themselves, except maybe Clark in showing his love for Moore.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       PENALIZNG SUCCESS   Just a quick commentary.  Why do some people, the left-wingers mainly, feel the need to punish people for making it life?  We're told all our lives to work hard and make something of ourselves.  Then when we do, Democrats feel the need to tax the hell out of us.  The richest people of this country are already paying something like 95% or more of the total income tax each year, why isn't that enough for some.  In May of last year, Michael Moore appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and told Bill that he thinks the rich should be paying somewhere around 70-80% of their income for taxes.  That's outrageous.  How is this fair?  I think Steve Forbes had it right with his flat tax.  Here's a quick rundown of his idea.     "Start by scrapping the tax code. Don't fiddle with it. Junk it. Throw it out. Bury it. Replace it with a pro-growth, pro-family tax cut that lowers tax rates to 17% across the board and expands exemptions for individuals and children so that a family of four would pay no taxes on the first $36,000 of income.  Not one cent to the IRS on the first $36,000. Anything over that would be taxed at a flat, fair 17%. "   Also, it wouldn't hurt the government to stop wasting our money on stupid stuff.  Things like hundreds of thousand of dollars in grants for such stuff as the study of porn and it's affect on the female brain.  Does porn make a woman horny?  That's what the government is wasting our money on.  Here's a great site that exposes all the crap like this,  urlLink Citizens Against Government Waste .  Eliminate this garbage, and taxes wouldn't have to be so high.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       DAMNED IF WE DO AND DAMNED IF WE DON'T   There's a large outcry by the Iraqi's for elections sooner than later.  Many believe their not ready for an election this early.  As for myself, I don't know if their ready or not.  But I say wait.  At least untill things calm down a bit more.  But you know what's going to happen either way, don't you?  If they don't get their election when they want it, we'll get bitching and moaning from the left in this country as well as others.  And if we give them an election too soon, and it fails, we get blamed for that.  Either way, we're screwed.

Just a little photo editing, but if Michael Moore can do it to the cover of his book why can't I?  Is it in bad taste?  Maybe.  Am I being a little hypocritical?  Could be.

       SUPPORTERS AND ENDORSERS   I thought I would post here the now 7 candidates and their supporters and  endorsers.  Give my opinion and some facts on them.  John Edwards, Joe Lieberman, Dennis Kucinich and Al Sharpton.   I can't find anyone in the news that endorsing these guys.  I'm sure they have there big name supporters, but I can't find them.  John Kerry.  He has the support of the staple of the Democratic party, Ted Kennedy.  The man that's been around way too long.  I don't know.  If I were Kerry, I wouldn't want a murdering drunk going around the country supporting me.  Gary Hart.  A former looser for the office and an adulterer. Good one.    Wes Clark.  Clark has the support of mockumentry director Michael Moore.  That's bad enough, but he also has the support of his puppet masters, The Clintons.  That's worse.  A lying piece of crap director, a former president that shamed this country and a lying senator.    And the man, the myth, the legend, Howard Dean.  Dr. Dean has the support of Al Gore and Bill Bradley.  Both are loosers for the office, Gore a two time  loser .  Janeane Garofalo, Martin Sheen & Rob Reiner.  Two very extreme Left-Wing actors and a meathead.  Good company if you ask me.  I'm sure there's more, but it's late and I'm tired.

       I'VE HAD IT   I'm mad as hell, but I'm going to keep taking it.  I got a new gold chain for Christmas and the damn this is starting to piss me off.  Why you ask?  Because I also have a beard growing.  Every time I lean down, the chain rides up and locks onto a single hair and pulls it.  And it hurts.  So this is a warning to all you guys with beards and necklaces.  Watch out.    DAMN   Did you seen Dean after his loss lastnight?  The man was possed by the spirit of Hitler.  Screaming at the top of his lungs, waving his hands around, talking about how he was going to invade the whole country.  Got that invading part from Dishwaster, another blog I'm trying to get up.  Thanks.  I may have spoke a little too soon when I said we may have seen the first nail in his presidental coffin.  Didn't "Bubba" Clinton finish third in Iowa?  I'm now more scared of Dean than ever.  Not because he could win, but because he's mentally unbalanced.

       KERRY WINS   Well, it's offical.  John Kerry wins the Iowa Caucauses.  But there's also other big news.  The biggest news for me is that the hero of the Dems, Howard Dean, came in  third .  Wow.  John Edwards came in second, Dennis Kucinich got 1% and Dick Gephardt is dropping out.  Just a great night all around.  Now Kerry and Edwards have new momentum going into NH and Howard Dean seems to be in trouble.  We may have just seen the first nail driven into the presidental coffin of Howard Dean.  I heard that Republicans are more scared of Edwards winning than any other candidate.  Well, I wouldn't say scared.  Maybe more concerned.  Edwards is a carismatic guy.  Young and very likeable.  He could win some of the southern strongholds of Bush if he were to run.  But, I still hope it's Edwards -vs- Bush.  If push came to shove, I could live with Edwards being president more than I could any of the other Dems.

       MY ENDORSER      Wes Clark is parading his endorsment by extreme Left-Winger Michael Moore, I thought I would post who I would want backing me if I were running for office.  Both are in the extreme of their perspective parties, except Nugent isn't a hypocritical liar like Moore.  I think Clark should drop Moore as fast a Moore drops his camera when lunch is called.  Because if Clark wins the nomination, Moore will hurt him very badly in a general election.  There's plenty of Republicans that hate Moore.

       CREATE YOUR OWN BUSH CONSPIRACY   I have a new site for you.  This has to be the best site I've seen in some time.  On it you can create your own G.W. Bush conspiracy theory.  Here's the tag line on the front page:   "Want to come up with your own conspiracy theory about Bush? Don't let Al Franken, Michael Moore, and MoveOn.org have all the fun! Use this handy George W. Bush Conspiracy Theory Generator to come up with your own conspiracy theory!"   Here's one I came up with.   "George W. Bush rigged the 2000 election so that oil companies and Rush Limbaugh could oppress minorities."   It's just great fun diving into the mind of a Liberal.  I've kept you in suspence long enough, the links in my drop down menu.  You can't miss it.  Have fun.

       HE'S GOT MY SUPPORT   Well, the Iowa caucus is tonight.  The night in which people go out and vote for the candidate that they want to run in November.  A night that mean nothing.  The Iowa caucus means nothing.  It the New Hampshire and everything after that one that means something.  Anyway, I'm throwing my support behind one of the Dems running.  Yes, you read that right.  I, here and now, and pledging my support for John Edwards.  I hope Edwards wins tonight and ends up running in November against Bush.  Edwards is the only Dem running that has stayed on course.  He's stayed possitive.  He hasn't felt the need to bash every one of the other candidates running.  He hasn't felt the need to spread lies and smear others.  He looks like and genuinely good guy.  A nice guy.  That's what the Dems need.  Not someone who's bitter and angry.  Someone who shouts and cries foul.  John Edwards would be the man that would get my vote, if I were a Democrat.  I think it would be a great race in November if it turns out to be Bush -vs- Edwards.    DAMN YANKEE      Here we see "southerner" Wes Clark parading around in a New England Patriot's sweatshirt yesterday pandering for the New Hampshire vote.  Wes Clark is from Arkansas, home of his puppet masters the Clintons, and he's going around showing his pride for the northern Yankees.  Not the baseball team, that's just what some of us call you up north.  People from he south are very proud and being southern.  And with the southern caucuses coming up soon, that may have been a bad move for Clark.  We are also football freaks, some are anyway, and with him wearing a Patriots sweatshirt, and the Pats taking on the Panthers from SC he could have screwed himself out of a few votes.  Maybe.    HOW DARE HE   Today is MLK day, and Howard Dean went to a memorial for Dr. King.  How dare he do something like this.  During and election year?  President Bush placed a wreath at the grave of Dr. King a few days ago and he only did that because he was stumping for votes.  Acording to Democrats.  So the "good" Dr. Dean must be doing the same, right?  Right?     AND THEN THERE WHERE____   As stated above, tonight is the Iowa caucus.  I'll make this short, I'm tired of typing.  I think after tonight, two candidates will drop out.  Al Sharpton and Dennis Kucinich.  These two haven't a chance in hell of winning, and they know it.  So, if it's not in the next couple of days it'll be right after NH.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       MY 2 CENTS   I have to throw my 2 cents into the subject of Bush going around the Senate to appoint Charles Pickering.  Good move.  Pinkering has the votes to be appointed, but the Democrats refuse to vote.  Why?  Their reason's because he's an extreme Right-Winger.  He a racist that supports cross-burning.  Well,  urlLink Ted  said it perfectly in his post.  Pinkering defended a cross-burner.  Read what Ted has to say about this.  Democrats have been bitching and complaining for almost four years about every vote counting, well, vote for heaven's sake.  Let the votes count.

       TOP 3   Nothing I want to blog on, so I thought I would talk about my favorite 3 albums.  Well, I call them albums but for me their CD's.  Although they were once on vinal, because none of them are new music.  98% of music today is crap.  Enough of my gripping, on with the reviews.    3.  Led Zeppelin IV - Three words, Stairway To Heaven.  That song's not the only reason I picked this album, but it's the number one reason.  With great masterpieces like Black Dog, Rock & Roll and Misty Mountain Hop, this is one CD that needs to be in your player.  But Stairway To Heaven will send you into another place when you listen to it.     2.  Dark Side Of The Moon - This is Pink Floyds crowning achivment.  There's nothing I can say about this album that's hasn't already been said.  This is a phenominal piece of music.  Money, Time, Us and Them, Brain Damage/Eclipse.  Some of the finest songs ever written.     "You lock the door And throw away the key There's someone in my head but it's not me.  And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear You shout and no one seems to hear And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes I'll see you on the dark side of the moon"   Also, David Gilmour is one of the best guitar masters on Earth.     1.  Back In Black - The best rock and roll album ever set to vinal, tape or CD.  AC/DC put everyone to shame when they recorded this album.  There is no single word in the English vocabulary to describe this album.  It was created as a tribute to their lead singer who had just died a few months earlier.  With songs like Back In Black, Have A Drink On Me, Let Me Put My Love Into You and the song with the best opening ever, Hells Bells, is it any wonder why I picked this one?       Eveyone one who reads this needs to go out and get these albums.  Put that rap crap, hip hop, country or what ever else you have one the shelf and cover yourself in rock and roll.

       WHAT'S HAPPENED TO US?   I was watching MSNBC's  Hardball  last night, the only show that's not on Fox News that makes sense.  During the segment which has some guy going around the country and gathering a group of people together and asking them questions about politics, this time is was Iowa Caucus voters, he asked the question "Should the Dems be attacking Bush or going after each other".  Only three of the people there said they should be attacking Bush.  Now mind you, there were all Democrats.  When asked why they shouldn't be attacking Bush, the overall answer was that they felt that the Dems should be talking not about what Bush is doing, but rather what candidates are going to do for them.  "What are you going to do for  me ?"  Chris Matthews, I think, brought this point up.  What ever happened to the days of JFK?  Remember when he said, "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country"?  What happened to that?  Now it's all about how the goverment is going to help me, what can they give me.  We've lost our way.  We take and take and take from this great country, yet most give nothing back.  You may have noticed that I've changed my phrase at the end of my post.  I'm going to keep this quote.  If you've seen the move  Tears Of The Sun  with Bruce Willis, great movie by the way, then you may have seen it at the end of the credits.  It's a quote from Irish philosopher Edmund Burke.  I think it says it all.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       GERMAN  BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE  COVER   Here's the German cover for Micheal Moore's mocumentry  Bowling For Columbine .      That's class there.  A child holding an American flag with bullet hole in his head.  I'm not too big on guns myself, but my readers know what I think of Micheal Moore.  If you don't, I feel Micheal Moore is the biggest threat this country has.  A mentally disterbed person with a medium for spewing forth his lies and hate speech.  I also love his own brand of flip-flopping.  He condemned the bombings in Kosovo, yet he's endorsing the man that was in charge of them, Wes Clark.  Wow.    God Bless America

       ONE DROPS OUT, ANOTHER RISES UP   Two "big" pieces of news about the nauseous nine to report on.  They no longer can be called the nauseous nine.  Carol Moseley Braun, the only woman on the ticket, has dropped out.  My question is, why did it take so long?  She knew she didn't have a snowballs chance in hell of winning, yet she wasted all this money for nothing.  Ms. Braun has, not surprisingly, thrown her support behind Dean.  Well, there's another 6-7 votes for Dean.  But the big news of the day is that John Kerry seems to have over taken Howard Dean in a recent poll in Iowa as the front runner.  You add in the margin of error and Dean, Clark and Kerry are basically dead even.  But only a few months ago Dean was considered to have it in the bag.  It doesn't look that way anymore.  The "good" Dr. Dean may have peaked too early and may be on a gradual down slide.  Look for Dean to become even more frustrated and to lash out even more at people.  Like the retired man in Iowa a few night ago.    2 NEW LINKS   I'd like to thank  urlLink Proud American Girl , don't know her real name, for this link.  You can't miss it.

       YET ANOTHER DEAN FLIP-FLOP EXPOSED   We all know that Howard Dean is notorious for his flip-flopping on issues.  Well, another Dean flip-flop has come to light.  It seems that in 1995, then Gov. Dean urged "Bubba" Clinton to take unilateral military action in Bosnia.  The same thing Dean has criticized President Bush for doing in Iraq.  In the letter Dean wrote Clinton he says, "After long and careful thought, and after several years of watching the gross atrocities committed by the Bosnian Serbs, I have reluctantly concluded that the efforts of the United Nations and NATO in Bosnia are a complete failure.  It is evident, however, that the cost in human lives in allowing this policy to continue is too great." Therefore, he continued, "I have reluctantly concluded that we must take  unilateral  action" in Bosnia to stop some of the worst genocide since World War II.  Sound kind of familiar, doesn't it?

Yes, you read right, moveon.org.  Some may be asking, "Why in the hell would you put a link to that site on here?"  Well, I'll tell you.  Like Fox News, I'm fair and balanced.  Or at least I try to be.  I've given you links to sites that tell the truth, like Fox News, Moore Watch and Bush's Blog.  So I have to balance that out with sites that tell outright lies and spin.  Like Moveon.org and Dean's Blog For America.  It's only fair.  More may come down the line, I don't know, but enjoy the two I have now.    God Bless America

       DEAN YELLS AT A VOTER   There was yet another presidential debate today.  But this one stands out among to others because towards the end of this one Howard Dean blew his stack and yelled at a voter in the audience.  Dale Ungerer, a retiree from Iowa, stood up during a Q&A session and was telling the candidates, "Please tone down the garbage, the mean mouthing, the tearing down of your neighbor and being so pompous".  He was talking about the Bush bashing that's become mainstream in the house of the Democrats.  Mr. Ungerer said that, "You should help your neighbor and not tear him down".  To which the "good" Dr. Dean replied, "George Bush isn't my neighbor".  Here's where the true feeling of the Democrats come through.  Mr Ungerer told Dean that yes, Bush is his neighbor.  To which Dean screamed at the man, "You sit down. You've had your say and now I'm going to have my say".  Then he went into his diatribe about how Bush is an evil liar.  He brought up the tidbit about how some think it's unpatriotic to criticize Bush.  All of this was done to massive applause from the audience.    Here's my thoughts on it.  Of course Dean yelled at the man.  He's a retiree.  Dean doesn't like the retired.  After all, he wants to do away with the tax that pays for Social Security.  And the only time I ever hear about this moronic theory about criticizing Bush is unpatriotic is when Democrats bring it up.  I've yet to hear a Republican say it.  And of course there would be massive applause at Dean yelling at this man.  Mr. Ungerer's a Republican and the idealogical "Deaniacs" just loved seeing Dean rip into the poor man.  Way to go Dr. Dean.  That's the way to win over the people.  Yell at an old man just because you don't agree with him.    God Bless America

       HOWARD DEAN TO THE RETIRED, "SCREW YOU"   As we all know, Howard Dean is a serial flip-flopper.  And, not surprisingly, he's done it again.  For months Dr. Dean has been going around the country saying he wants to repeal every Bush tax cut.  Even the ones for the middle class.  But yesterday FNC's Carl Camron caught Dean flip-floping.  Now Mr. Dean wants to find a way to repeal the tax cuts, but not for the middle class.  And how does he plan to do this?  By cutting the payroll tax.  But there's one problem with that.  The payroll tax is what funds Social Security.  Didn't Gore, and every Dem in America, said that Bush was going to essentially destroy Social Security?  And here's Dean clearly saying that's his plan.  Let's see if Gore stands up with his principals and slams Dean for this.  Smart money says he won't.    HILARY MAKES RACIST JOKE   Recently Hilary Clinton made a joke about Ghandi working in a gas station.  We all know the stereotype about Indians and covenant stores.  Remember when Trent Lott made that statement about Strom Thurman?  How the media ripped him to shreds.  Or Rush's comments on ESPN?  The media went after him with a vengeance.  How come the same's not happening to Hilary Clinton?  If a Republican had made the same joke, there would a massive outcry for him/her to resign.  Is there a bias?  You be the judge, but I think you know were I stand on this.      God Bless America

       REAGAN ON A DIME   There's a small movement going around to try and get the face of FDR removed from the U.S. dime and have it replaced by that of the greatest president of the 20th century, Ronald Reagan.  It was started by Washington Republicans, and I guess has a small following of supporters.  I only heard about it just recently.  Hell, I'm all for it.  But I say let's take it one step further.  I say let's remove the worst president we've ever had from the $20 and put Reagan on it.  I don't see the dime thing happening, but it's worth it.  FDR knew were going to be attacked by the Japanese and let it happen so we could get ourselves into WWII and out of the depression.  He doesn't deserve to be on the dime.  Do I really believe that last bit?  No, that's for Gohan.  See how stupid we can be sometimes.    God Bless America

       BUSH IS A MODERATE, THE IOWA CAUCUS IS A WASTE OF TIME AND HAMAS IS OKAY   At least in the eyes of Howard Dean.  Click  urlLink Here  to read an article on Newsmax.com.  I'll give the gist of it to those who don't want to go because they may think it's all lies by the website it's on.  It talks about a show called "The Editors" in which Dean made frequent appearances on.  During these appearances, Dean said things like he thinks GW is a moderate.  He now calls him an "radical".  He has doubts about Al Gore.  Saying that Gore isn't quick on his feet.  Go read the article.    God Bless America

       BUSH'S BIG MISTAKE   As much as I hate to admit it, GW isn't perfect.  He's making the biggest mistake this country has seen in some time.  Damn near granting a full citizenship to illegal aliens.  He wants to allow these people to stay here and work, legally.  Why are these lawbreakers getting rewarded?  We have people coming here legally, spending years going through the proper channels to become legal citizens and now come to find out they didn't have to.  All they had to do was sneak across the border and then never learn the language, lie, buy some fake documents and *boom* their legal.  They must be feeling like chumps, because that's Bush is doing.  Making chumps out of them.  This is a bad move.  However, if Democrats were in power, they would grant them amnesty.  Which is 100% worse.  With Bush's plan, they only have three years, which is bad enough, but if Dems had their, they would be full U.S. citizens.  So, it could be worse, but not by much.

       ALL HAIL DEMOCRACY   Well it seems that the fall of Saddam Hussein is having a bigger impact than some would like us to think.  It now appears that countries who have sponsored terrorism are willing to sit down and talk.  Libya, Iran, North Korea, Palestine, Syria and others.  Why are they wanting to do this now?  Could it have something to do with Shock and Awe?  Could it have something to do with the capture of Saddam?  I think it's yes on both accounts.  With Bush not playing the wimp and standing up for what's right, the leaders of these nations are scared to death that what happened to Saddam will happen to them.  They don't want to give up their totalitarian rule.  With the growing desire of democracy spreading throughout the Middle East, these dictators don't know what to do.  In my humble opinion, Iran will be the next Middle East country to set up a democracy.  There is a massive outcry from the Iranian people, and Ayatollhah Hoseini-Khamenei will no longer be able to ignore them.   While I'm on the subject of Iran, I think it's funny has hell that the world still sees us as the the enemy.  Even while we're sending more aid and supplies to Iran than the rest of the world, combined I think, to help out the earthquake relief, we're the bad guys.  It was President Bush that ordered the aid and supplies be sent to Iran, but he's still worse than Hitler.  Evil, evil man.  How could he help them like that?

       162 MILLION REASONS TO KILL YOURSELF   A woman in Cleveland, OH claims she picked the winning numbers for the $162,000,000 lotto jackpot, but lost the ticket before the drawing.  She says that while leaving the store where she bought her ticket, she dropped her purse and the ticket blew away.  There is some evidence that supports her claim that she had the winning ticket, but without the actual ticket she can't claim the money.    Damn, talk about being pissed and depressed.  I'd go on a rampage if it were me.  162 million dollars.  Poor woman.    God Bless America

Dr. Dean went to the head of the DNC, Terry McAuliffe, and complained about the other presidential candidates attacking him on a constant basis.  This is priceless.  Poor wittle Dean can't take the heat, so he wuns and tells mommy.  I love it.  President Bush is attacked every which way from Sunday and is called every horrible, vile name in the book, yet he hasn't ran and told someone to make it stop.  He hasn't complained.  If Dean can't handle this, how in the hell can he hope to run this country should he win?    God Bless America

       TAKE A CHILL PILL   I wanted to blog on this diet craze that's been going around lately.  Low carb, low fat, low cal and every thing else you can think of.  The celebs diet secretes.  And our obsession with looks.  This Atkins diet is the most popular of them all.  Under this plan you can't have any bread what so ever, but if you want a jar of mayo and a sick of butter for breakfast, that's okay.  People, please calm down.  If you spend half your day counting fat grams or calories, then you're not enjoying life.  Eat that pizza, eat that hot dog, eat that cake.  Drink that pop, have fun.  Exorcize to stay healthy, but not so you can feel that you look good.  If people don't, or can't, except you for who you are, screw them.  I'm sick and tired of this obsession we have for skinny or muscular people.  Me myself, I like a women with some meat on her bones.  It shows she's not afraid of food and knows how to enjoy herself.  I don't mind a size 14 or 15 woman.  But when you wear a 1 or 2, EAT SOMETHING FOR HEAVEN SAKES.  You're too damn skinny.  So quit worrying about what other people think about and what they say you should look like and be yourself.     God Bless America

       DEAN, THE AVERAGE JOE?   I found this story a good read, I hope you do to.  As we all know, Howard Dean like to portray himself as the people's candidate.  The average Joe.  Yet, he grew up a rich brat in New York's Park Avenue.  In an interview with the NY Times, Dean and his mother talked about his childhood.  Said his mother, "Howard didn't have the least bit of a glamorous upbringing.  When I was growing up, we didn't even treat the servants like servants."  Things weren't all roses and Rolles Royces for Dean as a child.  Every time mother Dean would have a child, she would be forced to convert the dining room into a bedroom for the newborn.  Infact, space was so tight there was barely enough room for baby Howard's live-in nurse.  And according to Dean, some racism is okay.  His family were members of the Maidstone Club in the East Hampton's during the time when it was a white's-only club.  Dean said about this that just because his parents belonged to a club that excluded blacks and Jews, it didn't mean they were actually racist. Although, truth be told, from time to time the occasional racial epithet did slip out.  "Yes, there was sort of this casual racism, in terms of the racist expressions that were used by that generation."  During the 2000 election, people went on at length about how Bush grew up a rich kid and had everything handed to him on a silver platter.  Well, where's the same talk about Dean?     God Bless America

       LIBERAL BITCHING   I am so sick and tired of hearing Liberals across the country bitching a moaning about how they don't have a voice anymore.  How conservatism is taking over the country.  While it is true that this country is leaning more to the right these days, it's also a trend that happens every decade or so.  Wrap your brains around this.  During the 30's, this country was leaning left.  During the 40's and 50's, it was leaning right.  During the 60's and 70's, the country was leaning back to the left.  During the 80's, it was leaning toward the right.  During the 90's, back to the left and now in the first decade of the new millennium it's back to the right.  Don't worry, it'll lean back to the left soon.     God Bless America

       STUFF TO TALK ABOUT   It's been awhile since I've had a full post here, and there's some stuff I want to talk about.  But first things first.  Please forgive any spelling errors in this post.  I don't have Microsoft Word anymore, so no spell check.  I'm looking to download a spell check, because I need one.  Two,  I like Windows XP.  I had ME before and thought it was okay.  I didn't see what people were talking about when they said it was crap.  It worked okay for me.  But now that I have XP, damn.  My computer is twice as fast.  Nice.  Third,  I love my new MP3 player.  It's just a 64MB RCA Lyra, but it's amazing.  The sound is awesome.  Forth, I love Unreal Tournament 2003.  Best damn game I've ever played.  Get it.   And last in the nonsince department.  I've been reading about people I know who have all been messing with their new digital cameras they got for Christmas.  And Ted, I see you got three of 'em.  I wanted one for Christmas, but didn't get one.  How about sending me one of them.  (Hint, Hing, Wink, Wink)  Now on to the real stuff.  Howard Dean has showen his real colors yet again.  He's threatened a boycott of the Presidental election next year if he doesn't win the nomination.  What a cry baby.  But what can you expect from a Democrat?  Go to  urlLink Ted's Blog  to see the real reason Momar Khadafi gave into the U.S.  Great pic.  See, going in and taking Saddam out has shown the world that Bush isn't going to roll over and play the wimp.  His approval number are up, the economy is up and support for the action is Iraq is up.  This is Bush's election to loose.  4 More Years, 4 More Years.  On the election news. There's reports that Bush is considering either Colin Powell or Condoleezza Rice as his running mate next year.  Bad move, maybe.  I thought he already said Cheney would be his running mate.  I only hope that if Bush does ask Powell or Rice to run with him it's because Cheney made the choice himself to drop out.  Also, it could be seen as pandering to the black voters.  But it may also help him.  If Powell or Rice is his running mate, that could bring black voters over to vote for Bush as it will bring a black person closer to being president than ever before in the history of America.  I told  urlLink Jake  that Powell would run in '08, and now it looks like that could happen.  Again, sorry for any spelling mistakes.  Bear with me.  It's good to be back and happy new year.     God Bless America

       I'M BACK   Oh happy day, Oh happy day.  I am back and I'm better than ever.  I haven't had a computer since Christmas.  I screwed mine up and had to go buy a new hard drive and Windows XP to get it going again.  I couldn't retreve all my junk from my old HDD, so I lost all it and I'm trying to start over from scratch.  There's so much I want to blog on, but I'm too busy right now.  Don't worry, you'll all get to read my diatribes soon.  One last thing.  I just found out that some of you may not be able to see my site the way I ment it to look.  I didn't know you had to have the fonts I used for the site on your computers.  Some of the stuff I have looks too damn plain without the fonts.     God Bless America

       HAPPY LEAP DAY   Once again, it's leap day.  I've never understood what leap year's all about.  I think it has something to do with farmers or something.  I don't know.  But anyway, enjoy your extra day.    ARISIDE LEAVES POWER   Jean-Bertrand Aristide has fled for his life.  The now former president of Haiti has left power and is on his way to South Africa to live in exile.  Supreme Court Justice Boniface Alexandre is now in charge until a new president can be elected.  Aristide has been under mounting pressure from world leaders to leave power, and I guess he finally decided to do so.  In my opinion, it's because of one thing.  President Bush said that it would be best for Aristide to leave and Aristide didn't want he same thing that happened to Saddam to happen to him.  It's that simple.

       HILLARY CLINTON IS STUPID   And I have the  urlLink proof .  The NY Senator said that America would be safer if W followed the path of previous administrations on terrorism policies.  Which, she insisted,  "had foiled attacks on U.S. targets during the 1990s" .  And that's the proof of her stupidity.  I guess she's just never heard of the bombing of the WTC in '93, the bombing of the U.S. Embassies is Kenya & Tanzania, the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in OKC in '95 and the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000.  Those sound like terror attacks, and all under her hubby "Bubba".  Again, she's just a stupid woman.  And this is the person some want in the White House?  I pitty this country if she ever steps foot in their again.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       ENDORSEMENT TIME   That' right, it's time for another product endorsement.  I'm such a shill for the man.  Any way, today I have two DVD's to endorse.  If you love great classic rock, you'll love these.   Led Zeppelin  This is their recent 2-disk release of concerts they gave over their 10 year recording career.  It has 4 awesome concerts, Royal Alber Hall - 1970, MSG - 1972, Earls Court - 1975 and Knebworth - 1979.  There' also a butt load of promos and performances that were televised over the years.  But their concert at Knebworth is the stand out performance here.  Their sound is tight and they're meshing like a band should.  If you've ever seen "The Song Remains The Same" you would have heard what Page sounds like when he's stoned out of his gourd.  At Knebworth, he sounds like he's cleaned himself up.  He and the band are at their peak.  It's also their last appearance in England before John Bonham died.  Great 2-disk set.  Go out and get it.   Pink Floyd's The Dark Side Of The Moon  This DVD is the making of the greatest album in music history.  This will tell you everything you've ever wanted to know about DSoTM.  What the cover of the album means, where the songs came from.  It also has footage of the band in the studio making the album, some footage of the members playing their parts live during the interviews, some demos, Allan Parsons mixing the album.  Everything.  Get this DVD.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       IS THIS BIASED?      This appeared in today's Tulsa World.  A local left-wing newspaper.  The article it goes with talks about how teens are seeking ways to confront and eliminate racism.  In a perfect world, you know.  But look at the cartoon.  What is it trying to tell you?  What I get out of it is that only white people are racist.  The white guy has an angry look on his face, one fist is clenched and he's pointing at the black woman's butt.  That tells me that's he's supposed to be making some kind of racist remark about the stereotype of black women having big butts.  Why is it when we talk about racism in this country, it's always the white man who's racist?  What, blacks, Latinos, Indians and Asians can't be racist?  This just pisses me off every time I see or hear something like this.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       MY ENVIRONMENT MADE ME DO IT  I  had to "steal" this post from  urlLink Claudia .  I don't think I've read many things more true than this.   What makes a hero  Benedict Arnold was a war hero, wounded in battle -- before he turned against his country. Hitler was likewise a decorated and wounded veteran of the First World War. Being a war hero is not a lifetime "get out of jail free" card, exempting you from responsibility for what you do thereafter.  -Thomas Sowell   That says it perfectly.  Great find.

       ONE LITTLE VICTORY   Martha Stewart has won a huge victory in court today.  The judge threw out the securities fraud charge against her.  The charge accused Stewart of deceiving investors in her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, by lying about her sale of ImClone Systems stock.  If convicted of the charge, Martha could have gotten ten years in prison.  But she's not out of hot water yet.  The remaining four charges carry a max of five years.    I think this is just one big witch hunt.  With all the real crime going on, this is what the Government's throwing our money at.  Martha's just the scapegoat.  The Government just want's to prove their tough on corperate criminals, so they go after the biggest name they can find.  Martha Stewart.

       HE'S BACK   The  urlLink The Angry American Atheist  that we all know and love has decided to pick himself up and return to blogging.  He's still wrong on everything, but it's good to have him back.    CENSORSHIP   First a warning.  I don't think anyone here will agree with this post.  In fact, I think most may hate it.  I'm not a firm supporter of censorship, but I do think some things do need to be censored.  If it causes harm to the public in general for instance.  I'm not talking about points of view.  I think everyone has a right to state their point of view.  As much as I hate Michael Moore and Martin Sheen, I don't think they should be censored.  Damn, that was harder to type than I thought.  What I'm talking about is entertainment.  Music, movies, TV and the like.  Someone like Eminem should be censored.  His "music" causes harm to the public, more so to kids.  When they get berated with lyrics that talk about killing cops, murdering his wife and chopping her up, you can't tell they don't get desensitized to it.  And that can be harmful.  All this is brought on by Clear Channel dropping The Howard Stern Show from their airwaves.  I totally agree with it.  In fact, they should have done it years ago.  The stuff he talks about on his show doesn't belong on radio.  This may seem a little fascist, and it very well may be but that's how I feel.  Now, do I believe that this should be the law of the land?  No.  My views don't constitute law, just as no one else does.  The general law is to let the public decide what's appropriate and inappropriate.  I think that's the best way, but it's not the perfect way.  Whether it's by letting the public decide or the Government, some people are going to be forced to live in an uncomfortable environment.  So what do we do?  I don't know.  If I were smarter, this would be a better post.  As it stands right now, it's so full of holes you could probably find a mouse running through and eating it.  But I think you get the point I'm trying to make.  Some people don't want this stuff permeating the airwaves, and they shouldn't be forced to "deal with it".  I understand the first amendment, freedom of speech and all but freedom of speech doesn't mean we can say what ever we want when we want.  There are limits to free speech.      HAITI   Okay, my quick take on the situation over in Haiti.  I think Bush needs to intervene.  We've already sent something like 50 Marines over there to protect the American Embassy, but that's not doing enough.  We need to go over there and clean up Clinton's mistake.  W said that we would help democracy where ever it was needed.  Don't let the Loony Left think they're right and only help oil producing countries.  We helped in Afghanistan, Iraq and Liberia.  Now we need to help Haiti.  It's the right thing to do.  "The measure of a great leader is his willingness to do what's right, even if it costs him everything".  Churchill said that.  I can't remember the actual words, but that's the quote.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       ROSIE TO MARRY IN SF   Rosie O'Donnell is set to marry her girlfriend in the capital of Loony Land, San Francisco.  I don't know if she already has, or is planning to.  Let me know. "I think the actions of the president are, in my opinion, the most vile and hateful words ever spoken by a sitting president. I am stunned, and I'm horrified,"  Rosie said on GMA this morning.  I'd sure like to know what was so hateful about what Bush said.  Did he use the words "homo" or "fag" and I missed it?   "I find this proposed amendment very, very, very, very shocking. And immoral. And, you know, if civil disobedience is the way to go about change, then I think a lot of people will be going to San Francisco. And I hope they put more people on the steps to marry as many people as show up. And I hope everyone shows up".   Hell, it's San Francisco, the law means nothing there.  All this is, is an attempt by a former star to try and get her name back in the spotlight.  I guess she thinks that if a "celeb" does it then the majority of Americans who oppose gay marriage will change their minds.

       SPRING TIME'S A COMING   Yes, it's the end of February.  March is upon us, which means Spring's almost here.  I hate Spring.  Between the months of March and September, we have storms.  If you live, or have lived, in middle America or the south then you know what I'm talking about.  Living here in Oklahoma, I live smack dab in the middle of what's known as "tornado ally".  Oklahoma has the second highest number of tornadoes a year, second only to Texas.   And Spring is the breading ground for tornadoes.  These things scare the living hell out of me.  What makes it worse is that I live in a mobile home with no cellar, and we've all seen what these things do to mobile homes.  During the Spring and Summer seasons I'm in a funk.  That's why I love late Fall and Winter.  So if my posts start to drop off in their amount and frequency it's because I'm just not in the mood to post.  So far I've been lucky and have never been through one yet, but my time's coming.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       THE DOWNSIDE OF A SAFE AMERICA   Could Bush lose in November?  Yes, absolutely he could.  But not because of the economy.  Despite what the Lefties want us to believe, the economy is getting better.  Not because of anything Bush has done wrong in the War On Terror.  Despite what the Lefties want us to believe, the War On Terror is working.  Maybe working a little too good.  We've all seen the "experts" on the talkshows talking about how Bush's downfall this Nov could be the fact that Americans feel safe.  If you look at the polls, we've put the War On Terror(Homland Security) as the number two or three most important thing this election year.  Bush has done such a good job on this subject, we've lulled ourselves into a false since of security.  Under Clinton, we had four or five major terrorist attacks on America, Americans or American interests.  Under Bush, we've had one.  We're starting to believe that it won't, or just plain can't, happen again.  And I think we're going to be in for a terrible surprise one day.  Remember waking up on the Sep. day and turning on the news?  Remember seeing that plane hitting the tower?  Remember that feeling?  Well, the next time this happens, and I'm afraid it will, it's going to be many times worse.  Homeland Security should still be foremost on our minds.  The economy is just money, terrorism affects something far more important than money.  The point of this post is that we need to wake up.  We are safer today than we were in 2000, but we're not safe.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       TERESSA KERRY IS AFRICAN AMERICAN   But not black.  According to Mrs. Kerry, because she grew up in Africa she's African American.  But, if you'll notice, there's a difference in her African American and the other African-American.  The hyphen's missing in her meaning.  That's right, Mrs. Kerry says that  African-American  belongs to blacks, but  insists that it's proper to call herself African American as long as no hyphen is used or intended.   "My roots are African,"  she told a reporter in 1995.  "The birds I remember, the fruits I ate, the trees I climbed, they're African."   This is the best thing I've ever heard.  Even though she grew up amidst segregated privilege in colonial Mozambique, and that she's African American, she really hasn't helped "her people".  Beside giving money to the Save The Children Fund, she really hasn't donated much of her vast fortune to Mozambique.  She has nearly a quarter of Mozambique's annual Gross Domestic Product and she can't donate to her "homeland".  Damn.  I wonder if people like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will eventually jump on this?  If Bush were to say he were Mexican American because he was raised in Texas, people would shit their pants calling him a racist.  But I doubt anyone even mentions this in the next 9 months.

       HAYWORTH IN '08   I was just watching Crossfire and Congressman J.D. Hayworth was one of the guests.  As I watching and listening to the Congressman, I got to thinking.  He should run for president in '08.  He's an intelligent man, well spoken and seems to have a grasp of the issues.  80% of being president is communication, and Hayworth can do that.  If you happen to agree with me, you should write Mr. Hayworth and let him know that he should run sometime in the future.

       DEATH PENALTIES ALL AROUND   Finally, two of the detainees at Gitmo have been charged with war crimes and will stand trial before a U.S. military tribunals.  Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi and Ali Hamza Ahmed Sulayman al Bahlul, try saying that one time fast, were both body guards of asshole number one Usama bin Laden.  Besides being human shields for the bastard, al Qosi was a paymaster for Al Qaeda and al Bahlul was a propagandist for bin Laden.  Al Qosi is charged with setting up a business that would funnel money into Al Qaeda thus giving them means to continue their terrorist attacks.  The indictment for al Bahlul says that bin Laden ordered him to make a video tape glorifying the attack on the USS Cole.  The intend of the video was to  "inspire Al Qaeda members and others to continue violent attacks against property and nationals, both military and civilian, of the United States,"  the indictment said.  Al Bahlul was also ordered to set up a satellite connection in order for bin Laden to watch the event of Sept. 11 unfold.  But he was unable to do so.  Poor bin Laden.  He didn't get to watch is master plan unfold live.  Like the title says, death penalties all around.  These two scum fucks should receive the worst possible punishment the American people can think of.  My vote, red hot metal bars shoved up their asses.    NO GAY MARRIAGE   W has called for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  Saying that we must defend  "the most fundamental institution of civilization."   Along with the amendment banning homosexual marriage, he also said that states should be allowed to make laws that recognize other types of relationships.  A.K.A. civil unions.  I'm behind this 100%.   "Unless action is taken, we can expect more arbitrary court decisions, more litigation, more defiance of the law by local officials - all of which adds to uncertainty,"  Bush said.  We can't have these extreme left-wing state courts makeing laws.  That's not their job.  I know a lot of people, Republicans included, don't support an amendment to the constitution but right now that seems like the only way to stop these rogue courts.

       ELECTIONS IN IRAQ   Late 2004 or early 2005.  That's when the U.N. says Iraq will be ready for elections.  Remember when the U.S. said elections should be held later rather than earlier?  That Iraq wouldn't be ready for elections when they wanted them?  People flipped over that.  But the U.N. says the same thing and they're okay with it.  What the hell.

If you do not close down the moorewatch site and you continue to bad mouth michael moore I will penetrate your flesh with a blunt object and play with your blood. You have 10 days to comply.

       WE DID IT   Ralph Nader's presidential run brought to you by the VRWC.  Yes, we were able to convince him to run.  I can't tell how we did it, but let's just say it involved a needle and a new drug we're working on.  I knew about this Friday, but because of the stunt I pulled Tuesday telling you we were in talks I couldn't tell you before hand.  But I have to give you my honest opinion.  I don't think this helps Bush in anyway.  The Dems have become a one track party.  Get Bush out at all costs.  That's their only goal.  So I don't think Nader will get that many votes, but we should see the DNC flipping out for a few months.  So that should make for a few good laughs.

       HISTORY OF THE GOP   Found this site that describes the history of the GOP and I though I would share some of it with you.   The Republican Party was born in the early 1850's by anti-slavery activists and individuals who believed that government should grant western lands to settlers free of charge.    So, what do we learn from this part?  Before the Republican Party was founded, there were two main parties.  Democrats and Whigs.  After the GOP was founded, most Whigs joined up.  So that tells us that the Democratic Party was the party of pro-slavery, not the Republican Party.  If the Whigs joined the GOP, then the Whigs must have been anti-slavery.   The first official Republican meeting took place on July 6th, 1854 in Jackson, Michigan. The name "Republican" was chosen because it alluded to equality and reminded individuals of Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party.   Now you can make the argument of Jefferson being pro-slavery.  You can do it if you want, but he also was instrumental in establishing the freedoms we now have.   In 1856, the Republicans became a national party when John C. Fremont was nominated for President under the slogan: "Free soil, free labor, free speech, free men, Fremont." Even though they were considered a "third party" because the Democrats and Whigs represented the two-party system at the time, Fremont received 33% of the vote. Four years later, Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican to win the White House.   33% right out of the gate.  Kind of reminds me of what's happening today with Nader.  The Green Party is considered a "third party" and they have every right to become a player in presidential elections.  Just don't tell the DNC that.  Abe Lincoln was our first Republican president.  He was one of the key supporters of abolishing slavery.   The Republicans of the day worked to pass the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery, the Fourteenth, which guaranteed equal protection under the laws, and the Fifteenth, which helped secure voting rights for African-Americans.    Outlaw slavery, equal protection under the law and voting rights for blacks.  Boy, if you listen to the world today the Republican Party is the party that's trying to hold the black man down.  Proof has nothing to do with history evidently.   In 1896, Republicans were the first major party to favor women's suffrage. When the 19th Amendment finally was added to the Constitution, 26 of 36 state legislatures that had voted to ratify it were under Republican control. The first woman elected to Congress was a Republican, Jeanette Rankin from Montana in 1917.   Wow, Republicans were also instrumental in women's rights.  Plus the very first woman elected to Congress was a Republican.  Kind of dampens the image the Democrats portray us as being, doesn't it.   Abolishing slavery. Free speech. Women's suffrage. In today's stereotypes, none of these sounds like a typical Republican issue, yet they are stances the Republican Party, in opposition to the Democratic Party, adopted early on.   It seems the Democratic Party was lead kicking and screaming into the 20th century, not the GOP.  The GOP, Grand Old Party.  Now you know our history, your history.  Go out and spread the word.  Let the world know you're proud to be Republican.  The party of anti-slavery and pro women's rights.

       EDUCATION, WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING EDUCATION   According to a recent Fox News poll, Democrats ranked education as the third most important issue this election year.  Behind the war on terror and the economy.  Now, when did money become more important than the education of our kids?  What happened to "money's not the most important thing"?  Wouldn't a reasonable person put education as the number one,or number two at the very least, priority?  Well, I think I just answered myself with that question.  We're not dealing with reasonable people, their Democrats.  Dems would  hypocrisize, is that even a word, themselves for benefit.  They say what the polls say, and when the poll change they change with them.    Education War On Terror (Homeland Security) Health Care Economy  That's my priorities.  Now, I know we need jobs but how do we get those jobs if education is so low on the map?    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       KIDS TODAY   I was channel surfing yesterday and I happened on a few of these shows geared toward kids.  Stuff like MTV, Nickelodeon and the like.  And I started thinking to myself, "God, I'm glad I'm not a kid growing up now.".  It's not any one thing that I can put my finger on, it's just a little bit of everything.  I'm not too far off from the target audience of these shows,  except Nicelodeon, but it's like a completely different world.  Music, fashion, language.  And I realized something, I'm and adult now.  I'm 25 years old.  I'm grown up.  Most of this stuff is supposed to appeal to me, but I can't stand it.  I've always been old school.  The old stereotype of getting older and not understanding "the kids of today", I found out, is true.  But I've never followed the trends of my generation.  I don't understand the fasication with groups like Outkast, Jason Mraz, Avril Lavigne, Clay Aiken and such.  It's wailing, screeching crap.  One other quick argument about music today.  I was looking through Yahoo shopping music to find some of the names above and under the Rock section they had listed:  Janet Jackson Melissa Etheridge Kylie Minogue Norah Jones Britney Spears Beyonce TLC  Remember when rock and roll was Led Zeppelin, The Doors, The Rolling Stones, AC/DC, Blue Oyster Cult, The Who and the like.  I know, before my time, but like I said.  I'm old school.  What the hell happened?  Anyway, back to topic.  When I was in 5th grade, I remember getting excited when I could see the  outline  of a bra through a girls shirt.  Today, hell, that's nothing.  We have 5th graders today who are wearing these low rider jeans, or what ever their called, with the straps of their tongs handing out.  What the hell happened?  This country's moved on in the wrong direction.  I don't know, maybe it's just that I'm just getting older.

       RUN, RALPH, RUN   I have never seen the Dems as scared as they are right now.  They are terrified that tree huger Ralph Nader will throw his hat into the race this year.  We all know that Nader was one of the causes of Gore losing in 2000, and they don't want it happening again.  The DNC has operatives following Nader begging and pleading him not to run.  Nader has every right to run.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but in 2000 Nader almost got the 10 or 15% of the vote that the Green Party needed to be eligible for government matched funds.  Who knows, maybe this year he'll get it and then the Green Party will be a viable party in national elections.  Not that that would be a good thing.  That's all we need is another extreme left-wing group.  So run, Ralph, run.  Don't let people sway you in the direction they want you to go.  Follow your heart and do what you want.

       NEW LINK FOR YOU TO ENJOY   I have a new link for you to explore and enjoy.  A guy named Donald J. Hagen e-mailed my the link to his site.   urlLink Political Test  It's a satirical political beliefs assessment test.  It's pretty funny.  It's not a question/answer type of quiz.  It's asks questions and give different answers for them to determine whether you're a Conservative, Liberal, Libertarian or Communist.  It's not meant to be taken seriously, it's a humor site.  Here's an example of some of the questions:  Robin Hood's practice of stealing from the rich to give to the poor was...  CONSERVATIVE: a crime. LIBERAL: a brave, generous and heroic deed. LIBERTARIAN: a foolish, misguided attempt at social engineering.  COMMUNIST: an inspiration to us all.   I commute to work...  CONSERVATIVE: alone in my enormous monster 4x4 pickup truck that measures its gas consumption in barrels per mile. LIBERAL: in a very, very, very tiny electric car that would probably lose if it ever crashed into anything larger than a small sized dog.   LIBERTARIAN: on my own two feet.  COMMUNIST: using transit for the masses.  It's a long test, so be prepared to read.  And here's something, I may be a closet Libertarian.  There's quite a few Libertarian answers that I agree with.  Not all of them, I don't think even the majority, but a few.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       HOWIE D'S CAMPAIGN SLEEPS WITH THE FISHES   That's right.  It may not be new news by now, but it's news.  Howard Dean has dropped out of the race.  NaNa, NaNaNaNa, Hey Hey Hey, Goodbye.  Sing along.  This was a truly spectacular thing.  Just a few months ago, Howie D was the number one man in the Democratic Party.  He labeled himself as anti-establishment and an outsider, though it wasn't true.  He gave the Democratic Party the anger, which some mislabled as passion, that it needed.  We can't deny what he's done.  With this anger, John Kerry is now ahead of Bush in the polls.  Some say his voting record will be the downfall of Kerry.  I don't believe that.  The Dems are so full of anger that they don't care.  They just want Bush out of office and they don't care who does it.  But back to Dean.  He then went out and got the support of the establishment he said he was against, and I think that was his downfall.  He showed himself as the hypocrite that he is.  He gave us the "Yeaaaaaa" hear round the world and we got to see the unstable man Dean really is.  This irrational, hate filled, ideologue.  So now we're down to two men, John "Frankenstein" Kerry and John "The South Is My Backyard" Edwards.  I don't consider Sharpton and Kucinich as candidates.  They're the fat lady in this sideshow of a race.  Kind of entertaining, but not too interesting.  With Edward's strong showing in Wisconsin lastnight, he has shown himself a worth running mate for Kerry.  But he has stated that he will not accept a VP slot with Kerry.  Let's see if he keeps his word.  On the subject of keeping your word, and back to Dean as well.  Remember a few months back when Dean said that if he doesn't get the nomination that he would start a boycott.  I wonder if he'll keep his word?    WICTORY WEDNESDAY   It's that time again.

       VRWC UPDATE   I could be kicked out of the club and forced to move to France for telling you all this, but the rumors of Ralph Nader possibly running are true.  The Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy have been in private meetings with Nader for the last month.  We are trying everything we can to get him to run.  Mind control, hypnosis and even threats of bodily harm if he doesn't.  We need Nader to run, we need him to take the extreme looney votes away from Kerry.  I'll keep you abreast of developments are they happen.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

They're on their way to winning the FA Cup for the third year in a row for a total of 10 championship wins.

       MAYOR NEWSON   Well all know the story by now.  Mayor Gavin Newsom of SF has sanctioned 87 illegal gay marriages.  Am I the only one who thinks Mayor Newsom should be thrown out of office?  Hasn't he heard about Prop 22?  You know prop 22, that's the proposition that was passed by a huge majority of California voters that says only a marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.  Mayor Newsom is breaking the law, plain and simple.  Remember Judge Roy Moore in Alabama.  He put up a monument to the 10 Commandments in the courthouse.  People went ballistic over this.  Why, because he was breaking the law.  Where's the outcry for Newsom to obey the law?  What he's doing is trying to make law, and the mayor doesn't get to do that.  Just like the courts don't make the law, but don't tell that the 9th circuit court of appeals in SF.  He should be arrested and thrown from his seat.

I never thought I would have someone in another country reading this blog.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       NO BLOOD FOR WHAT OIL?      First, let me say that it wasn't easy going through all these anti-freedom websites to get a picture to post.  We all remember that during the war, and even still today after, we could turn on the news and see people all over the world with signs that read, "No Blood For Oil".  People thought that we were going to war in Iraq so we could steal their oil.  Well, here's some proof to the contrary.  In the past three weeks, the price of gas has went up 3.61 cents a gallon.  That's up 17 cents a gallon since late December, which raises the average price to $1.69 a gallon for regular.  Now, if were stealing the oil from Iraq wouldn't that mean we would be getting our oil dead cheap?  So in turn, wouldn't cheap oil mean cheap gas?  But, as you can see, the prices are still going up.  Here in Oklahoma the price is around $1.45 a gallon.  So what's the deal?  Are all the "No Blood For Oil" people wrong?  Could we have went into Iraq to free the Iraqi people and not for all the oil we want?    And here's a little something else.  A website called  urlLink United States of Earth  has an article up about the oil bribes Saddam made to counties thoughout the world.  Some of nations mentioned are India, Bulgaria, Russia and everybody's favorite, France.  There's another story out, but I can't find it right now, that talks about evidence found in Iraq that shows Saddam made bribes to Germany, Russia, China and France with oil.  No big surprise there though.  If someone could find that story, let me know.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       KERRY, "I'M NOT BUBBA".  OR IS HE?      John Kerry has categorically denied the rumors of an affair with 27 year old Alex Poller.  You all should know the story by now.  Kerry cheated on his wife with Ms. Poller and asked her to leave the country.  She's now in Africa with her fiance.  For Kerry's sake, he better hope it's not true.  He's already gone on record saying it's not true.  Remember the trouble "Bubba" got into for lying about an affair.  But I have a feeling that somehow it'll come around to it being the RNC who started the rumor as part of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy.  I stand before you and say that's bumpkiss.  It never occurred to us to start that rumor.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       KERRY'S PURPLE HEARTS   Let's examine John Kerry's three purple hearts he was awarded during his tour in Vietnam.  First a word.  I'm not diminishing his bravery in the slightest.  Just going over to Nam took more guts than I have.  He is a hero, and he's braver than I could ever be.  It takes a real man, or woman, to lay your life on the line for another.  Purple Heart number one was awarded on Dec. 2, 1968.  Kerry, during his first intense combat action, was slightly wounded on his arm.  Purple Heart number two was awarded on Feb. 20, 1969.  Kerry earned this purple heart after sustaining a minor shrapnel wound in his left thigh.  Purple Heart number three was awarded on Mar. 13, 1969.  A mine detonated near the boat Kerry was in.  Kerry sustained a slight wound to his right arm.  And you know how many days of service Kerry missed because of these three wounds?  Two, and both of those were from the mine explosion.  After his third Purple Heart, Kerry requested to be sent back home because under Navy law a soldier who is wounded three times is allowed to return the United States.  He didn't have to.  He could have stayed and finished his tour of duty, but he decide to turn his back on his "band of brothers" and go home.  And the rest is history.  Again, I'm not diminishing what Kerry did in Nam, only that we shouldn't think that he received his purple hearts because of some life threating wounds.

       KERRY A DESERTER?   Thanks to  urlLink Ted  for this.  Here's something I didn't know.  According to  urlLink Vets Against Kerry , John Kerry didn't finish his tour of duty in Vietnam.  After recieveing the Silver Star, Kerry used an obscure Navy regulation to leave Vietnam and his crew before completing his tour of duty.  Does that sound like a hero to you?  All veterans are heroes, but turning your back on your "band of brothers" and running before your tour of duty is up is sorry. Why hasn't Terry McAuliffe and Michael Moore jumped on this bit of info yet?  I hope the GOP slams Kerry with this during the election.

       THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST      Just six words.  I want to see this movie.  I'm not a religious man, but this movie is something I have to see.  I saw the trailer way back when it had just come out and was amazed by it then.  I want to see it almost enough to plop down $13 at the theater.  Almost, but I think I'll wait for it to come out on DVD.  That way I can watch it as many times as I want.  But I have a feeling this is going to be, if not the biggest, then one of the biggest movies of the year.  I think it will be the biggest foreign film of all time though.  I hope this blows Titanic out of the water, no pun intended.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       NASCAR AND BEING OFFENDED   Well, the Daytona 500 is being raced this weekend.  I caught a piece of  Fox News this morning and the reporter was talking to the sponsor of the Interstate Battery car.  The number 18 car will have an ad for "The Passion Of The Christ" on the hood.  She asked him if he worried about anyone being offended by it.  He gave a great answer.   "The chances of doing something that 100% of the people will agree with are slim to nil." .  Now, I'm offended by beer ads everywhere I look, but does anyone care?  No.  Should they?  No.  Because I'm not everyone.  People have condemned this movie without even seeing it.  Wait 'till you see it, then judge it.    We have become a country that's too sensitive to everything.  Like what  urlLink Brian's post  deals with.  People removing words from books so people won't be offended.  Now I can understand it to a limit.  If you don't want your kids seeing, reading or hearing things you think their too young for.  But for the most part it's got to stop.  Textbooks can't say "Founding Fathers" anymore because it may offend women.  We're made to fell guilty if we say "black" instead of "African-American" or "midget" instead of "Little Person" or "man/woman" instead of "Person".  You know who's to blame for the majority of this don't you?  That's right, the west/east coast Liberal who thinks the entire world should follow what they think and do.  They are so out of touch with reality it's scary.  We all need to take a chill pill and calm down.  You're not a racist, insensitive or ignorant because you don't use weenie PC terms.  And one last thing.  You all knew I couldn't spell worth crap.  Why didn't anyone tell me that Blogger had a spellchecker build in?  I'm highly offended by this lack of action.  Like the majority of people today, I pass the blame on to you all.  It's not my fault I was too dumb not to see it there.

I humbly apologize for posting it.  I thought it looked kind of clear for a 30 year old clipping, but I just ignored it.  It's 100% my fault.  I am sorry.

       JOHN KERRY AND THE OTHER WOMAN   According to The Drudge Report, John Kerry has had an affair with another woman.  The story is still developing, but according to Drudge Kerry asked the woman to leave the country.  Don't start to get all giddy or anything.  This won't stop Kerry.  Think of "Bubba" and Jennifer Flowers.  That didn't stop him.  But it looks like John Kerry has modeled himself after John Kennedy in more ways than we thought.

       THE MANY FLIP-FLOPS OF JOHN KERRY   We all know that John Kerry has no real core values.  He's flip-flopped on almost every issue known to man.  In this post, I will attemp to list all of those flips and flops that I can.   1.   In Oct. 2002, Sen. John Kerry voted for the Iraq War resolution.  Not too long after his vote, he decided to change his mind.  Then he votes no to send more money to the troops in Iraq for basic gear that they need to survive.   "Iraq may not be the war on terror itself, but it is critical to the outcome of the war on terror, and therefore any advance in Iraq is an advance forward in that..." .  John Kerry in December of 2003, two months ago.   2.   John Kerry says he want to rid Washington of special interest groups.  Yet, he's accepted more special interest money than any one in the in Senate over the past 15 years.   3.   Kerry once said that the wounds of the Vietnam War should not be opened by politicians trying to take office.  Yet, he mentions the war every chance he gets.   "I am saddened by the fact that Vietnam has yet again been inserted into the campaign, and that it has been inserted in what I feel to be the worst possible way... What saddens me most is that Democrats, above all those who shared the agonies of that generation, should now be re-fighting the many conflicts of Vietnam in order to win the current political conflict of a presidential primary".   Kerry in 1992.   4.   Kerry voted for the Patriot Act, but now he's strongly against it.   5.   Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind education bill, but now he's against that as well.   6.   Kerry claims he supports our American troops, yet after the Vietnam War, under his leadership, the VVAW (Vietnam Veterans Against The War) members mocked the uniform of United States soldiers by wearing tattered fatigues marked with pro-Communist graffiti.  That's a slap right across the face.   7.   In 1998, John Kerry stated that he was against the death penalty for terrorists.  But now he's for it, saying that "the law of the land must be upheld".   8.   John Kerry did once support gay marriage, but now he says he opposes it.  What do these 8 flip-flops show us?  That John Kerry is for something when it's popular and against it when it's not.  He believes in nothing except what helps him get ahead.    It's time for Celebrity Mole, so I have to go.  I love this show.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       KERRY'S SPECIAL   According to the  urlLink Washington Post  John Kerry has raised more money from paid lobbyists than any other senator over the past 15 years.  In fact, right now he's number one in the Senate for taking special interest money.  Out of 100 people, he's taken more than anyone else.  As of Jan. 31, 2004 he had raised $225,000.  Twice that of any other Dem running.  Kerry said he would "happily release any lobbyist meeting I've ever had," but has yet to do it.  What's Kerry trying to hide?  He's a hypocrite.  His message is to rid Washington of special interest groups while going around the country on the dime of those same special interest groups.  I was watching  Crossfire  today and his campaign manager, or someone in the Kerry camp, was on there.  When asked about this, he tried his hardest to deflect the question by bringing up Bush some more.  And of course that wimp Tucker Carlson let him get away with it.  Carlson ain't a Republican, he's a wuss.  If it had been Sean Hannity asking the question he wouldn't have stopped until he got an answer.    One last thing, while I'm sort of on the subject of Fox News.  How come John Kerry refuses to do the O'Reilly Factor.  Or, for that matter, Howard Dean and Wes Clark.  Why are they so scared to have to answer anything but softball questions?  When Bush was running it 2000, he went on the O'Reilly Factor and Al Gore didn't.  And look who won that race, (nods head up and down as if saying "yeah, see").  It could be the best thing Kerry ever did going on Bill's show.

I know I'm not a mother, well, at least not a mommy type of mother, but it's still a good organization.  I grew up with an alcoholic parent, so I have a real distain for alcohol.  Plus, Indians and alcohol don't mix at all.  I've seen what it can do, and it's not pretty.  So if you know anyone who has a problem with alcohol, go there and get some info on how you can help them.

       QUICK HITS   I'm sort of in a rush, so the following will just be some quick takes on thigs happening.   GORE THE MOR-ON   Did anyone miss 3 time loser Al Gore's mad rant yesterday?  What the hell was he thinking?  He saw it didn't work for Dean the first time.  So why did he think it would work a second go round?  He's obveously been reading   Ron Suskind's   book, but he hasn't been listening to what he has to say.  Gore ranted about "Bush planning to go to war back in Feb. or March".  Didn't O'Neil refute that in an interview?  Thank God this man didn't win in 2000.  If he can't control his emotions under stress, what the hell would he have done after 9/11?   KERRY'S TURN      John "Frankenstein" Kerry, the man who said that a man running for the office of the president shouldn't be bringing up the Vietnam War just to get elected has been bringing up a lot recently.  From Kerry's own mouth,  "It is a sad day when the president of the United States is willing to sully another man's reputation and challenge his patriotism merely to get elected".   Questioning Bush's honorable discharge.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't you have to serve your time to get an honorable discharge?  I mean, if you go AWOL you don't get an honorable discharge.  Do you?  Also, don't you just love that picture?  "Frankenstein" with "Hanoi Jane", the woman the soldiers from the Vietnam era hate with a passion.  Post this picture on every blog and everyone e-mail it to to Kerry.  I guess stupid celebs are eternal.  From "Hanoi Jane" all the way to "Baghdad" Penn.  One last thing about Kerry.  Does anyone else think that the comments he made to the Senate in 1972 could come back to hurt him with veterns?  You know, the stuff he made up about them raping, killing, burning villages and stuff like that.  Lies like that could cost him.  If there's any spelling mistakes, you know what I ment so don't worry about them.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       DEAN ADMITS GORE IS BLACK CAT OF POLITICS   In an interview on CNN's  Larry King Live , Howie D told Bob Woodward that Gore's endorsment started the decline in his campaign.  That it worried the other candidates and the Democrtic establishment so much that the attacks reached an all time high.  Paul Begala, former Clinton aide, told the New York Times, "I suppose people are going to be running away from Al Gore the way the devil runs away from holy water".  By my count, this makes Gore a three time loser now.  Word of warning to any Democrat running for office in the future.  If Al Gore comes out and endorses you, just drop out and give up.    JOHN KERRY AND HIS ENRON TIES    urlLink Newsmax  has an article up which talks about John Kerry and his ties to Enron.  The former chairman, Ken Lay, sat on the board of Teresa's Heinz Center Foundation.  He reportedly was a Heinz Center trustee for more than a decade, resigning just last year.  Some may be saying, "This is his wife, not Kerry himself.  Your reaching Chris".  No more than Democrats like to reach for a Bush/Enron link. Go read the piece for the full story.

       REVIEW TIME   It's review time.  Tonight I'm going to be reviewing a movie and iTunes.  First, the movie.  Last night I watched a movie called "Vampire Effect".  This was an awesome movie.  It's from Hong Kong, so it dubbed over in English but it's dubbed really well.  I wish we could make movies like this here in America.  This was "Blade" meets "The Matrix".  There's a scene in which the two lead female stars first meet and get into a wicked fight.  Wicked, I know but it's the only word I can come up with to descibe it.  If you have digital cable or satellite and get Stars Action channel, watch for this.  The final fight scene is one of the coolest things I've ever seen.  Those asian directors really know how to make a movie.  Also, Jackie Chan has a cameo in it.  So you know he has a great fight scene.    iTUNES   iTunes sucks.  I won a free download from that Pepsi/Apple thing their doing.  So I go there and have to download a 20MB file on my 56K modem just to get it.  When I download the song, it's in a format called M4P.  And you can't play it with Windows Media Player, you can only play through iTunes.  I don't think you can even put it on an MP3 player, except guess which one.  That's right, the overpriced iPod.  Great song too,  The Who's   Squeez Box  live.  But you can burn it to a CD and rip it from there, I think.  But that's a big hassle for just one song.  Another downside to iTunes.  Well, all these legal download sites actually.  No rare or unreleased songs.  If it's not on a CD you can buy in stores, you won't get it there.  I like to hear the suff I can't find in stores.  Alternate versions of songs and rare, unreleased songs.  Like this one version of  The Guess Who's   No Time  I have.  It's an extended version.  Damn RIAA anyway.

       JUST WONDERING   Now that Howie D's campaign  has gone the way of Davy Jones, I wonder what Al Gore is planning on doing?  Gore has become the black cat of politics.  Everything he touches becomes jinxed.  If you think about it, when Gore endorsed Dean is when Dean's campaign  went downhill.  I also wonder if John Kerry will execept his support when Howie D sinks after Wisconsin?  If Kerry's even half as smart as he tries to be, he'll tell Gore to shove off.    BACK TO TED   Going back to  urlLink Ted's blog .  He as a great post up, from the National Review, about the world's favorite punching bag, the French.  Go read it.

       BUSH NAMES INTEL PANEL   President Bush has named 7 people that will form the independent commission to investigation pre-war intelligence regarding the Iraq war.  The two people that will head this commission are former Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb and retired judge Laurence Silberman, a Republican.  Other names on the commission are Sen. John McCain, Republican from AZ, Lloyd Cutler, former White House counsel to Presidents Carter and Clinton; former federal judge Patricia M. Wald; Yale University president Richard C. Levin, and Admiral William O. Studeman, former deputy director of the CIA.  But of course Democrats are sitting pretty with this.  They don't think Bush should be allowed to solely appoint the members of the commission.  As if everyone of them are under his power and will do anything he says.  As far as I can tell, there are at least two Democrats on the list.  Maybe more, I don't know the political leanings of everyone there.  And John McCain isn't someone who just lays down and does what he's told.  He's not Janet Reno.  President Bush has given them a deadline of May 2005 to release their findings.  But of course the Democrats what it done before the election because they think they'll have somthing to use against Bush.  Bush isn't Clinton.  He doesn't cover things up and then lie under oath.  But like I've said before, I don't care if Saddam had WMD's at that time or not.  He needed to be taken out anyway.  Plus, you know, he did have them.  Check Syria, Iran, Pakistan.  Hell, even Saudia Arabia if you want to find them.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       CARLIE FOUND   The body of 11 year old missing Florida girl Carlie Brucia was found this morning.  Police have yet to release details, but a law enforcement source close to the investigation said she was found between 12:45 a.m. and 1 a.m. Friday outside a church a few miles from the car wash where she was taken.  That slimy piece of shit Joseph P. Smith has offically been charged with the murder of the girl.  A source says that police found her body after negotiations with Smith.  So that means he told them where to find her.  I told you this would happen.  After he got a deal worked out, he told them where he left her.  But he'll get what he deserves in prison.  Even child killers are dispised in prision.  He'll be some big man's bitch, if he doesn't get killed himself first.    HAPPY BIRTHDAY      Today is the birthday of the greastest resident of the 20th century.  Ronald Wilson Reagan is 93 years old today.  President Reagan, as we all know, has been living with the disease Alzheimer's for something like 10 years now.  Which goes to show just how strong the man is.  10 years.  That's a long time.  Happy Birthday Mr. President.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       PRODUCT ENDORSEMENT   Time to endorse another product from a soulless multinational corporation.  This time it's Voodoo Rain drink.  This is some good stuff.  It's another SOBE type of stuff with the herbal junk the hippies like.  But ignore that.  The Purple Haze is awesome.  Go out and buy some of this stuff, because if your going to sell your soul to some commercialized company, you might as well get some cool stuff out of it.

       HOWIE D   Dishwaster had already beat me to the post about the 7 year old Pennsylvania girl, but I didn't know it at the time.  And he's alread beat me to the post on this one.  Well, blogging's man's game.  You either wake up with the chickens and post, or you miss out.  Howie D, for former darling of the Democratic establishment, has stated that he may just drop out if he doesn't win the Wisconsin primary.  "Dead man running, dead man running".  Just another rat out of the race.  But here's something I'm wondering.  A little ways back, Howie D said that if he doesn't get the nomination that he would boycott the election.  I wonder if he'll stick to his word?  Here's a hint, don't bet on it.  But look for his brainwashed zombie Deaniacs to raise a fuss.  Clark is out of it, Dean is out of it and Sharpton and Kucinich were never in it.  That leaves Kerry and Edwards.  Your nomination and possible running mate.

       WHAT THE HELL   Get a load of this story.  A little 7 year old Pennsylvania girl, Brandy McKenith, was suspended from second grade for swearing.  In school she used the word "hell".  But not like "hell no" or "the hell you say".  No, when one of her friends said "I swear to God", Brandy said, "You shouldn't say that.  You'll go to hell".  Again, What The Hell.  How is this swearing?  The principal of the school has refused comment.  Witold Walczak, legal director of the Greater Pittsburgh chapter of the ACLU, has come to the McKenith families defense.  Walczak said, "The school's policy says 'no profanity' and that's not further defined.  How should this little girl know that 'hell' is not allowed?"  Lord knows I despise the ACLU, but this one of the very few good things their doing.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       CLARK IS IN TROUBLE   There are reports that Hillary Clinton has privately thrown her support behind John Kerry.  She indicated at a Washinton dinner party that Kerry was clearly the best choice of the Democrats' field.  You know you're in trouble when the very people that got you in the race to begin with are now abandoning ship like rats.  Could we be seeing the first steps in Hillary's master plan for a shot at the White House?  It's all part of the Vast Clinton Conspiracy.  If Kerry wins in November, Clinton goes into obscurity until really 2012.  Because she couldn't win in 2008 going up against a President Kerry.  She could survive four years, but not eight.  If she becomes VP, she stays in the news for at least another four years.  She's dumb, but she's not stupid.    WICTORY WEDNESDAY   It's that time again.  Wictory Wednesday.

       A BLOG, A RANT AND A PLEA   I've added a link to Franken, I mean John Kerry's blog.  He's now the front runner, so I had to add it.  And since Howie D is floating belly up, I had to move his down a few pegs.  It's truly amazing when you think about it.  A year ago, Howard Dean was this phenomenon.  He could do no wrong.  The Democratic party was backing him 100% because they loved his anger, which they mislabled as passion.  But now, just like Joe Lieberman, they've turned their backs to him and hitched a ride on the Kerry bandwagon.  When you finish  behind  Lieberman in a primary, like Dean did last night here in Ok, you know you've fallen from grace.  But I suppose it's for the best for Dean.  Now he won't have to face the firing squad when Bush decides to fight back.  John Kerry going around talking about how the RNC is attacking him, because it's what they do, while all the time he's attacking Bush.  Duh Kerry, it's politics.  You attack, they attack.  That's how the game's played.  But sooner or later Kerry will have to answer for his not supporting the troops when they needed it the most.  Voting yes for the war but no for the funding for the troops.  That money would have got them more ammo and better protection, among other things.  And John Kerry said no to it.  He sent them to war, but decided that they didn't' need the appropriate protection.  But, as much as I hate John Kerry, I'm going to have to get use to him being called President.  Because, as I've stated before, I don't' think Bush will win in November.  There's just too many angry Democrats that still think the 2000 election was stolen from them.  If you listen to some of them, the number one thing they want is for someone to get Bush out of office.  Not a better economy, better health care or anything else.  The just want Bush out.  But I want to put this out now.  I know were still over half a year away, but whoever wins lets try to stay civil.  There will be enough people on both sides gloating and moaning.  We're better than that.  At least I hope we are.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       THE RESULTS, SO FAR   It's 8:51 PM CDT, and as of right now John Kerry has won Mo, Del, ND and AZ while John Edwards has won SC.  My great state of Oklahoma is still up in the air, but John Edwards has a small lead over Wes Clark.  This is do or die time for the General.  If he can't win Oklahoma, he really hasn't a chance of becoming the candidate in November.  This is the only state he even has a chance of winning.  Howard Dean just gave up for this round of elections.  Focusing only on the Feb. 17 Wisconsin primary just isn't going to do it.  I think Howard Dean may just be a fish dead in the water.  The other big news is that Joe Lieberman has finally dropped out.  He really didn't have a chance to begin with, but when Gore and the rest of the Democratic party turned their backs to him that really signed his death warrent.  I think Sharpton and Kucinich need to take some notes.  These two guys aren't Seabiscuit.  Their not the underdogs that are going to come up from behind and win it all.  I am going to make a prediction right here and now.  Come November, it's going to be Kerry-vs-Bush.  They keep showing poll after poll that say Kerry is ahead of Bush.  Well, duh.  Kerry has been in the news more what with the elections going on.  Kerry has been attacking Bush, but Bush has yet to go on the defensive yet.  We still have 9 months to go.  Nobody should be getting their panties in a bunch just yet.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       CALL THE COPS.  THERE'S BEEN A THEFT   Saw this on  urlLink Stark Truth  and I had to steal it and post it here.    A young teenage girl was about to finish her first year of college. She considered herself to be a very liberal Democrat and her father was a rather staunch Republican.   One day she was challenging her father on his beliefs and his opposition to programs like welfare.   He stopped her and asked her how she was doing in school. She answered that she had a 4.0 GPA, but it was really tough. She had to study all the time, never had time to go out and party and often went sleepless because of all the studying. She didn't have time for a boyfriend and didn't really have many college friends because of all her studying.   He then asked how her friend Mary, who was attending the same college, was doing. She replied that she was barely getting by. She had a 2.0 GPA, never studied, was very popular on campus, and was at parties all the time. She often wouldn't show up for classes because she was hung over.   He then asked his daughter why she didn't go to the Dean's office and ask why she couldn't take 1.0 off her 4.0 and give it to her friend who only had a 2.0. That way they would both have a 3.0 GPA.   The daughter fired back and said, "That wouldn't be fair; I worked Really hard for mine and my friend has done nothing."   The father smiled and said, "Welcome to the Republican Party".    I love that.  That sums it up perfectly.

He knows he's not going to get the nod.  Why waste the money?  If your state had one and you didn't go and vote, shame on you.

       DOING THE JIHAD RAP   Watching H&C last night and they had a segment talking about a rap video that was made by one of these Islamic fundamentalist groups.  Boy, what a $30 budget will buy these days.  Rap is bad enough, but rapping is Arabic was down right funny.  Apparently the Jiggy Jihadist "star" of the video was "singing" the praises of a Jihad against the Western world while wearing a ski mask to hide is identity.  I don't blame him.  If I were in this thing, I'd want my ID protected too.  But, just like any other rap video.  Some guy screeching while waving a gun.  If someone could find this, please let me know.

       SUPER TUESDAY   Tomorrow is Super Tuesday.  7 states are having either a primary or a caucus.  Oklahoma being one of them.  I've got my voting hat ready.  Has a bald eagle in front of an American flag.  I'm going to slap that puppy on and cast my vote for GW.  The media keeps saying that GW is running unopposed for the Republican nomination.  That's not true.  A man by the name of Bill Wyatt from Los Angeles is running against him.  But something tells me that Bill isn't going to get the nod.  As it stands right now, Wes Clark is in the lead in here in the Sooner state.  Which really doesn't surprise me seeing as how Arkansas is right next door.  This could be his only win so he better savor it.     Speaking of Super, the Super Bowl.  Or more specifically, the half time show.  I didn't watch it, but it's been all over the news today.  Justin Timberlake ripping Janet Jackson's outfit to show her breast.  This was so stupid.  Timberlake said it was an acciden.  But then why is Jackson wearing that metal thing over her nipple?  Was it planned out?  Can you say Duh?   I hate moronic things like this being done just for ratings.  You know, who cares if little kids were watching.  Who care if it offends people.  CBS and MTV don't care.  Just further evidence of the downward spiral this country's going in.  It's one thing to do it on cable, I don't care.  You have to pay to see it.  But when it's done on network tv for millions to see, that's a different story.  CBS and MTV should be fined the maximum penalty by the FCC.

       SUPER SUNDAY   Yes, it's that time again.  The Super Bowl is to be played today between the Patriots and Panthers.  A game I don't give flip all for.  Yes ladies, I'm that rarity.  A young, single male that hates football.  I hate most sports in general.  I like baseball though.  I can't sit through an entire game, but I like it.  My question is, why do they have to ruin those funny ads with a football game?  I want to see the  American Chopper  ads, but I'm not going to sit through the game to see them.  Maybe I hate football because it's become a wuss game.  Think about it.  Look at the game in the 60's and 70's.  Mean, tough and it had attitude.  Today it's all about the endorsments and payoffs.  How many millions can I get from this?  Give me the days when the clothesline was legal.  Hell, even when you could celebrate in the endzone by spiking the ball.

       BE A MAN "BUBBA"   So W broke down and is allowing his National Security Advisor to publicly testify to the "Kangaroo Commission".  An unprecedented move.  I'm still wondering when "Bubba" and Gore are going to even agree to testify, period.  Why is there no massive outcry from the public for these two to do the same?  They had eight years to try and destroy al-Qaida.  And what's their reasoning for not doing it?   "The public wasn't behind an invasion of Afghanistan at the time" .  Clinton didn't want to do anything to harm his image or make appeasers angry.  What the hell.  I love this quote.  I've used it before and I'm going to use it again.     "The measure of a great leader is his willingness to do what's right, even if it costs him everything"    Bush did it in Iraq.  And it may end up costing him the election because of it, but it was the right thing to do.  Saddam had to be stopped, and bin Laden had to be stopped.  But Clinton didn't stop him.  Wouldn't stop him.  I blame al-Qaida 100% for what happened 9/11,  I also put some blame on both administrations.  But I blame Clinton a hell of a lot more than Bush.  Eight years verses eight months, any reasonably intelligent person would too.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       GOP FUNDS NADER   I love this story.  It seems that 10% of the contributions to the Nader Campaign that are $250 or more have been given by Republicans.  People like Ben Stein, Jeno Paulucci and Terrence Jacobs have all donated to Nader's campaign.  As of February, Nader has raised $930,000, Kerry's raised $41,000,000 and Big Poppa Bush has raised a whopping $158,000,000.  And here's something Big Media won't tell you about W's money.  A huge chunk of that is from small donations.  They want you to think he raises it all from fundraisers that have $1,000 a plate dinners.  But that's not true.  Most of it comes from people like you and me who donated $250 or so.  The left like to talk about their "Grassroots Campaigns".  NewsFlash, Bush actually has a bigger grassroots following.

       MASSIVE HYPOCRISY     urlLink Brian   got it right when he called the 9/11 Commission a "Kangaroo Commission".  Get a load of this little piece of neglected news.  It seems that "Bubba" and Al "The Bore" Gore have yet to even agree to testify before the commission.  Which makes them the only non-office-holders granted that privilege by the Commission.  So while they (the Commission) and the Liberals run around like chickens with their heads chopped off all but demanding Condi Rice to testify publicly, they have yet asked the two most blamable men to do the same.  Does anyone else smell the hypocritical cover-up?  Although, does it really matter if "Bubba" were to testify under oath?  We all know how Clinton and the truth mix together.  Like oil and water.

       VR-WC AT IT AGAIN   Boxes of documents that contained FBI info on John Kerry's actions during the Vietnam War were stolen from Gerald Nicosia's house.  Nicosia wrote the book  Home At War: A History of the Vietnam Veterans Movement .  Mr. Nicosia spend more than 12 years collecting the documents from the FBI through Freedom Of Information act.  Then 3 of the 14 boxes in his home were stolen.  Nicosia said,     "It was a very clean burglary. They didn't break any glass. They didn't take anything like cameras sitting by. It was a very professional job. Was it a thrill-seeker who wanted a piece of history? It could be.  You'd think there was a very strong political motivation for taking those files. The odds are in favor of that".    I admit it, we did it.  The documents were stolen last Thursday.  Last Monday, five members, including myself, made plans to steal all 14 boxes but were only able to get three.    I love this.  There's a very strong political motivation for taking the files.  If the Right-Wing Attack Machine wanted the files, couldn't they have just requested them like Nicosia did.  Why steal them?  I mean if this author could get them, I'm sure they could.

       JUST A QUICK THOUGHT   I just wanted to post this.  Isn't funny how the loony left keep going on about the "Republican Attack Machine".  Every time the "attack machine" comes out, it's being used against someone who's attacking Bush.  How dare W defend himself.  How dare he.  Speaking of the R.A.M, an Orlando attorney has registered the phrase "Republican Attack Machine" as a trademark.  He did it so Dems couldn't use it in their campaign ads.  That's a smart move.  Now, not only am I a proud member of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy, I'm also a proud member of the Republican Attack Machine.  I hope this lawyer starts selling shirts that the slogan on it.

       LEAVE IT TO A FRENCHMAN   Guess who's taking up the defense for Saddam.  That's right, his best friend, a Frenchman.  There's a shock.  Jacques Verges, known for defending defending Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie and guerrilla Carlos the Jackal, said that Saddam's nephew wrote him a letter and asked him to take up his uncles case.  What will be Monsieur Verges defense?  That it is our, the U.S.'s, fault.    "We know very well that the Anglo-Americans armed Saddam Hussein, that the chemical weapons were sold by the allies,"   Verges said in a telephone interview.  I'm guessing he's going to leave out the part where France was secretly helping him build a nuclear reactor.  Monsieur Verges decried the treatment of Saddam since his capture.  Saying he feared he would be killed before he could stand trial.  This is another reason why the French are the scum of the world.  If you're French and you're offended by this statement, too bad.

       KERRY'S ECONOMY   John Kerry laid out some of his plans for the economy yesterday.  He said his plan would created 10,000,000 jobs in his first term with something like 4% unemployment.  That's a nice dream.  It's not impossible, Clinton did create something like 11,000,000 in his first term and get unemployment down to 4.3%.  I hate to say anything good about that piece of crap.  However, while we were having the best economic grown we could imagine there were things going on that would burst that bubble.  CEO's were screwing people over unchecked, terrorists were planning the worst terror event in the history of mankind and "Bubba" was getting his jollies off with his interns.  Then in 2001, the dot com bubble burst and oil prices began to climb because of Clinton.  How you may ask is that Clinton's fault.  Read the link below.   And bang, the recession started.  See, I give him something then I take it away.  All is right with the world once again.  Anyway, back on subject.  Anyone want to bet that Kerry's estimated ten million jobs will begin to be revised in the following months.  Bush got blamed for Clinton's recession, and if Kerry wins in November, he'll get the credit for Bush recovery.   Credit:   urlLink Newsmax      KERRY ON THE "RICH"     I was reading an article yesterday, sorry I can't remember where it was, and in it Kerry was talking about raising the taxes of the rich.  In Kerry's mind, anyone who makes over $200,000 is rich.  So Kerry wants to raise the taxes of these people.  I wander if he's really sat down and thought about this?  While for most of us $200,000 is a lot.  And maybe making that would put us in the upper class tax bracket.  But, for instance, in NYC, $200,000 would be considered middle class.  It's a little thing called standard of living.  Someone should really raise this to 'Ol Sour Puss.  He says he doesn't want to tax the middle class, but that's exactly what he'll be doing with that $200,000 figure.

       HOWIE D AT IT AGAIN   Okay, I'm flying off memory here.  I saw this earlier on FoxNews, but I only caught a quick bite.  Howard Dean was giving his endorsement to 'Ol Sour Puss today and he was rambling on about who do we want in the White House.  A man with purple hears and bronze stars like Kerry or someone like Bush who doesn't have any of these things.  I had to stop and just stare at Dean.  Isn't this the same guy who thought he would be better than Kerry?  Isn't this also the same guy that got out of Vietnam by skiing the slopes and pouring concrete?  All with a bum back no less.  Can anyone else smell the hypocrisy and double standards here?  It's amazing.  You really can't make this stuff up, can you?    BUSH BOMBS   Did anyone else catch W at that correspondents dinner last night?  He bombed with his jokes.  He looked uncomfortable.  Like he really didn't want to be there.  But I can understand why.  With attacks lobed at him every five minutes, I can imagine he wouldn't be in a very festive mood.  Which is sad because he can be a funny guy.  He did hit a small stride there for a minute or two.  He got off a good one at Kerry.  He was talking about calling foreign leaders across the world and hit a joke that went something like, "Hello, John.  It's Kim Jong Il here."  I can't remember how the whole thing went, but it was funny.  He was also able to make fun of his "Bush moron" moniker.  Talking about using trading cards to help with the names of foreign leaders.  Not bad, but it couldn't have been better.  On a side note, Bush shouldn't wear a tux anymore.  It didn't look right.

       BEEN A LONG TIME, BEEN A LONG TIME   It's been a while since I've updated my favorites blog, but I finally did it.  I post this only in case I happen to have a new reader that doesn't know yet that when the About Me is glowing red, that means it's been updated with either a product endorsement, a review or something along those lines.  Also, I've added a some more links to this site.  First are two that I've had on here for a few days, but you may not have noticed them.  One is a link the Cherokee.org site.  The official site for the Cherokee Nation.  Just gives you news and info.  The second is for a Blogger forum.  If you use Blogger and have some questions about how to do something, this is the site for you.  Then we have Photobucket.com.  It's a host site for photos.  It's the one I use for this blog.  You get 100MB of disk space(about 2,000 pictures) and 2,500MB bandwidth(about 50,000 hits) per month.  All FREE.  Yes, Free.  You can make a donation if you want.  If you make a donation, I think you get the bandwidth limits lifted.  But I'm not sure.  It's a great service.  And the last link is to a site that carries Mallard Fillmore strips.  If you're a Conservative, you know and love Mallard.  Enjoy.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       NO PASSION IN FRANCE?   It seems there's a theater chain in France that's refusing to show "The Passion of The Christ" because, as a Mr. Marin Karmitz put's it, it's "fascist propaganda."  Mr. Karmitz says he has always battled against fascism, and therefore, he will not show the movie on his screens.  Fascism is a systems whereby freedom of expression is denied, can somebody say "hypocrisy"?   Credit:   urlLink Bill O'Reilly      SPEAKING OF FRANCE   There was another bomb found on a French railway track today.  Now wait a minute.  Aren't terrorists only supposed to be attacking people who helped out America in Iraq?  You mean to tell me these cowards don't care who they attack?  I'm shocked.  I thought only America and it's allies were targets of terrorists.  People across the world need to wake up, take their rose colored glassed off for a second or two and see these people for who they really are.  They don't care who you are, American, French, Spanish or Arab, if they can attack you they will.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       CLARKE PULLS YET ANOTHER KERRY   I wish I had more time to give a good post about this, but I don't.  So I'll just give the shorthand version.  In Clarke's new book, he claims that Bush did virtually nothing before 9/11 to try and stop al-Qaida.  But a new tape discovered by   urlLink FoxNews   proves him wrong.  Read the linked article for the whole story.  Say one thing one day and another the next.  Sounds like John Kerry doesn't it.

       RICHARD CLARKE PULLING A JOHN KERRY?   We all see Clarke all over the news programs hocking his book.  In the book Clarke says that there was no evidence of an al-Qaida/Iraq link.  But he was singing a different tune in '99.  In a 1999 Clarke told the Washington Post that the U.S. believed there was a link between bin Laden and Iraq after "bubba" ordered the  bombing of the Sudanese pharmaceutical plant.  Read the corresponding link below for the whole story.  It seems that Richard Clake may have the Kerry Syndrome.  You know the one where you contradict yourself on issues by stating both sides for your own benefit.

I put my sitemeter up on Feb. 15, and in just over a month I've received 1000+ hits.  None of those being my visits.  Just too bad that's not 1000 different readers, only hits.  When I started this blog in Sept. '03, I thought maybe 10 hits a month would be my limit.  This FAR exceeds my expectations.  Stephen King calls his readers his "Dear Constant Readers".  I may need to come up with a name for you all.  And I have to give special thanks to my first reader, Jake.

       THE PASSION KNOCKED OFF TOP   As everyone has probably seen, as it's been all over the news, "The Passion of The Christ" has been knocked off the top spot in theaters.  While it is weird that it took "The Dawn of The Dead" to do it, is this really news worth?  I mean, good lord.  No pun intended.  Did people really expect this movie to stay number one for the rest of the year?  Speaking of which, did I call it or what?  I said this would be the biggest movie of the year, and it looks like I may have been right.  The only competition I can see this is year would be Spiderman 2, but I don't think that'll happen.

       IT'S DONE   As you can see, the new look is here.  Before anything else, I have to give respect to   urlLink Jeff Stark  .  He helped me with the final coding of the template.  So if there's anything wrong with this page, it's all his fault.  Just kidding, just kidding.  But thanks, Jeff.  Some things you may have noticed.  The load time.  With this new template, the whole page has to load before it will show up.  And yes, it takes a little time on 56K.  That's why I eliminated some stuff.  The banners most noticeably.  Plus they just didn't look good here.  Although I am sad to have to let the 9/11 banner go.  I may find a place for it here somewhere down the road.  Also the code is jumbled.  I'm so use to my old HTML being straight lined and easy.  This one is all over the place and it's hard for me to add new links and stuff, but I can manage.  If not, I'm sure Jeff, or someone, will help me out.  I like the new look.  It took me over four total hours of working with this code to get it right, plus however long it took Jeff to do what he did for it.  As I've said before, I hate HTML.  And I hate it even more now.  It's fun creating something like this, but too damn hard.  I've been wanting this thing to be a three column site for some time, but I just couldn't find the right template.  And I sure as hell couldn't do it myself.  I almost made it with a full brown background and left everything else white.  I'm glad I didn't now.  So, you know, let me know what you think.  I'd really appreciate the comments.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       ENDORSEMENT.  I DON'T WANT YOU STINKING ENDORSEMENT, NOW   This is an old story that was largely ignored by Big Media, but still good.  Did you get a load of Kerry when Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad endorses him.  I've never seen anyone backpedal so fast.  Just two weeks ago, or so, Kerry was boasting about foreign leaders wanting him to win over Bush.  But when one of them actually came public, Kerry flat out refused him.  His camp saying,  "This election will be decided by the American people, and the American people alone.  It is simply not appropriate for any foreign leader to endorse a candidate in America's presidential election. John Kerry does not seek, and will not accept, any such endorsements" .  If that's true, then why bring it up?  Maybe this is why Kerry was so upset that he called a Secrete Service agent a "Son of a bitch".  Smart move.  Call the man who's supposed to take a bullet for you a son of a bitch.  Smooth.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       MARK MY WORDS   I was going to post this last week, but never did.  I had the whole thing planned out, but I forgot it.  So if this comes off a little untied, please forgive me.    'Ol Sour Puss has been going around saying that he wants, when he becomes Pres., to get our allies into Iraq to help out.  You know, the U.N., France, Germany, Russia and the like.  But they don't want to be there.  Here's the "Mark My Words" part.  I want someone to write this down and keep it somewhere for future study.  If Kerry becomes president, he will bribe these countries to help out in Iraq.  I'm not sure with what, money, contracts or something.  But that's how he will have to get them involved.  And he will not called on it.  When Bush got all those countries to sign on to help in Iraq, he was criticized for bribing them.  John Kerry won't be.  Watch and see.    UPDATE  The new look for this blog is 95% complete.  It should be up and running either Monday or Tuesday.  I hope.

       THE PASSION BEING CHEATED?   Check this story out.  It seems that some movie theaters may be cheating "The Passion Of The Christ" out of it's profits.  A Miami, FL. woman took her family to see "The Passion" and bought 6 tickets to the movie.  When she got her tickets she noticed that they said "Hidalgo" on them instead of "The Passion".  When she asked the cashier to fix the problem, the manager of the theater intervened.   He told me that they have already sold enough tickets and these six credits wouldn't matter anyway ... he's [Gibson] made enough money anyway."   Movie's make money based on ticket sales.  How many other theaters are doing this?  Could "The Passion Of The Christ" have made more than the $280+ million that's it's reporting?  A theater doing something like this is pathetic.

       IS IT OR ISN'T IT   By now you've all seen the reports that Pakistani officials believe that they have the number two al-Qaida man, Ayman al-Zawahri, surrounded on the Afghanistan/Pakistan border.  But no one can confirm if it's him or not.  I hope it is.  If the number two guy can be caught, how far can bin Laden be?  If it is al-Zawahri they have surrounded, and they capture him, I don't see him giving bin Laden up anytime soon.  But with enough time and effort he will.    SPEAKING OF BIN LADEN   Has anyone else seen this video taken in I think 2000 from a Predator drone that supposedly shows bin Laden in Afghanistan.  They knew where he was and "Bubba" didn't do anything about it.  Another ball dropped by Clinton.  Then when Bush took office in 2001 they were unable to get the drones back into the sky before 9/11 to find him again.  Things were screwed up and fucked up by both Clinton and Bush's administrations, but Clinton had a bit more time to get the job done and didn't.  Read the article, it's pretty good stuff.

       MORE DOUBLE TALK   Here's some more of sour puss's standard double talk.  What Kerry is saying today:  "For a President, the decision may be lonely, but that does not mean that America should go it alone.     And what he said in Sep. 2002:  "If Saddam Hussein is unwilling to bend to the international community's already existing order, then he will have invited enforcement,  even if that enforcement is mostly at the hands of the United States , a right we retain even if the Security Council fails to act."     Well, which is it?  Either we don't go it alone, which we didn't, or we do go it alone, again, which we didn't.

       PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS TO ME   I've noticed something.  If you'll remember back during the 2000 election the media made such a big hullabaloo about GW growing up rich and privileged, while almost ignoring the fact that Al Gore had grown up the exact same way.  They were merciless in their attacks on W's background.  And now here in 2004, while they don't talk about W's up bringing anymore they're also not making the same claims about Kerry.  Why is this?  Is it okay for a Dem to grow up rich and privileged but not a Republican?  That's the only conclusion I can come up with.  Is this another case of Hypocrisy and Double Standards?    JUST AN OBSERVATION   Does anyone else find it funny and ironic that while John Kerry's calling Republicans lying crooks he's complaining about the "attacks" on him.  This is some priceless stuff.

       KERRY LIES, "NEWS" IGNORES IT   We all know sour puss is two-faced, but now Kerry has shown himself to be an opportunistic liar.  In Sunday's Miami Herald, John Kerry told the reporter  "I'm pretty tough on Castro, because I think he's running one of the last vestiges of a Stalinist secret police government in the world" .  Which we all know is a lie, but not the one I'm talking about.  Kerry later said,  "'And I voted for the Helms-Burton legislation to be tough on companies that deal with him" .  And that's the lie.  Kerry voted against it.  Does anyone else think ol' sour puss is pandering to the Cuban voters in Florida?  Can you say "yes".  I guess he was hoping everyone in America would have forgotten that vote.   Credit to   urlLink Newsmax      SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF   Here's something only a Dem could take pride in.  It seems that the official news group of al-Qaida, Al Jazeera, has thrown their support behind John Kerry.  The "news" network said of Kerry,  "A decorated war hero, Kerry supported the attack on Iraq and wants to see a strong U.S. military. But that hawkish stance is balanced by his promotion of healthcare coverage, workers' rights and environment-friendly practices" .  The al-Qaida news group talking about worker's rights, that's a laugh.  They also added that  "Kerry is well placed politically between his party's radical left and arch conservatives. And he has the funds to last the whole season if necessary" .  This is some good stuff.  I wonder if Kerry will take any pride in the fact that this terrorist supporter of a news group is endorsing him?  Wouldn't surprise me if he did.

A Houston, Texas woman gave birth to two sets of identical twins on the same day.  Not quadruplets, but two different sets of twins.

The odds of this happening are 1 in 11 million their doctor said.  The parents of the babies had been trying for 12 years to have a baby.   "I think God has a sense of humor" , said the father.   "He took a vacation, and when he got back from it he answered all of my prayers at once" .   I have never heard of anything like this.

       IT HAS BEGUN      Well, campaign season is in full swing.  John Kerry has a new campaign poster he is set to reveal.  It won't be released until sometime next month, but your ever sneaky blogmaster has gotten his hands on it a month early.  I think it works.  This will do wonders for Kerry's campaign.

We're number 1, we're number 1, we're....we're number 50, we're number 50.  Good thing we're stealing that Iraqi oil, isn't it.

       SPAIN, THE NEW FRANCE   Spain has had their elections, and the winner is...     Spain screwed up massively.  First off, socialism doesn't work.  Ask Cuba, France and Germany.  The world likes to talk about our economy being bad, take a look at their's.  Secondly, this just tells terrorists that they can win.  Like France, Spain surrendered.  Plain and simple.    urlLink Ted   said it better than I could,  "I hope the Poles, Italians, Romanians, South Koreans, Japanese et al are getting their helmets and flak jackets on. The Spanish have just shown that the terrorists can win. Just watch for more attacks against our allies in Iraq."   When they know they're able to win, they're going to get even more dangerous.  And just like the left here blame everything on us, the Spaniards have done the same.  I just hope when, not if, but when, other allies of ours get attacked they won't mistakenly blame us as well.  Hopefully, they'll be a little smarter than that.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       NEW TV SHOW      Here we see Sen. John Kerry and Sen. Ted Kennedy celebrating after their successful pitch of their new television show.  The show will be about two wild and crazy senators who fight crime, when their not casting votes in the Senate.  It takes place in both Washington D.C. and Massachusetts.  But put the kiddies to bed when this show comes on, because after a hard day of fighting crime and making law the two ladies men show the woman of D.C. and Massachusetts the nightlife.  The title of their new show will be  The Lurch and The Lush .  The new NBC show should premier sometime around November 10, 2004.  They were wanting to call it a Docu-Drama, but where forced to label it Fantasy.  I smell a hit.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       GET A LOAD OF THIS   On a message board I visit, Jake will know the one, someone from England started a thread about the terrorist attacks in Spain.  He starts off by saying that he's fed up with Al Qaeda being brought up everytime there's a terrorist attack.     "anyone else fed up with this happening every time there is a bomb attack .... or any terrorist incident.  seriously its pissing me off. im just seriously fed up with the media always reporting refrences to al qaeda ... every single time there is a terrorist attack. since when were they the only terrorist group?    ever since sept 11 this has happened. its obviously that spanish extreme group "eta" ... but suddenly yahoo has the main headline as "qeada linked" .... its getting to the stage where i consider it propaganda.  an american will read it quickly ... not bother to read in depth and think ... wow al quieda were involved. (its a natural thing ... no one ever reads articles fully - most just look at headlines). suddenly people get scare dof more attacks .... and suddenly george bush is the hero who will save everyone .... thansk t ohis war on terrorism.  even during the iraq conflict .. .saddam hussein was linked to al qeada. it seems george bush just uses the words "bin laden" and "al queda" when he wants something now."   He then ends it with,  fuck the government ran american media   I think he's got our media mixed up with someone else's.  I guess he either hasn't listened to the reports that al queda have taken responsibility or the BBC just refuses to air that little fact.

       TWO SMALL VICTORIES   "Yeeeeaaaaa".  We have two sort of victories.  The supreme court of loony land California ordered an immediate halt to gay marriages in San Francisco.  But that doesn't mean they've been outlawed yet.  The California SC will hear will hear the case sometime in May or June.  The second victory is in Massachusetts.  The lawmakers in Mass. have given preliminary approval to a proposal that would ban gay marriage but allow civil unions.  Hey, one and a half for the good guys.    NO STERN, SAY IT'S NOT TRUE   Howard Stern has said that if W signs new indecency legislation into law he will quit.  During this morning's show, congressman Gary Ackerman called Stern and told him that he wouldn't sign the bill.  Saying that he feels it will easily pass through the right wing-controlled House but that the Senate may veto it.  Stern said that even if Bush doesn't sign the bill he may quit.  He's tired of being censored every morning.  Two things about this.  First, no big loss.  Stern has been doing the same thing for what, 20 some years.  Get a woman in the studio and have her take her clothes off.  And if she doesn't call her a wimp or a coward.  It's stale and passe.  Second, I'm sure W's re-thinking this now.  Stern's threatening to quit his show has Bush freaking out.   Credit to urlLink Drudge      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       MORE HYPOCRISY   This post from   urlLink Stark Truth   was so good that I had to steal it.  Sorry Troy.   John Kerry ,as we all know, is not happy with the outsourcing of jobs overseas. He feels this practice costs us too many jobs here in the US. John Kerry has mentioned that he would punish companies that outsourced jobs overseas. Well Johnny,   urlLink look no further than your wife’s company   because 57 of the 79 food factories owned by Heinz are located overseas. He makes this so easy.  Talk about biting the hand that feeds you (and your campaign).   Like I've said before, John Kerry is a two-faced liar.  I wonder if sour puss is going to punish his wife's company?

That's right, John Kerry has yet to authorize the release of his military records.  Why?  Does he have something hide?

       A HIGHER STANDARD?   Thanks to Matt Ashby over at   urlLink Stark Truth   for the idea for this post.  In my post yesterday about sour puss Kerry making a racist statement and barely being taken to task for it, Matt re-posted it on Stark Truth and made the comment  "Republicans are held to a higher standard" .  I don't believe it's so much a higher standard as it is a double standard.  Like he said, Democrats get away with anything.  Trent Lott was giving praise to a 100 year old man and was called every name in the book for his comments and was pressured into stepping down, yet Kerry isn't.  Why?  Why is it okay for Robert Byrd have once been a member of the KKK, but not David Duke.  I think both should be beaten within an inch of their lives by the way.  "Bubba" Clinton is held as the greatest president of all time to the Dems even though he habitually cheats on his wife, yet Arnold is demonized for groping.  Again, I don't agree with either action.  A conservative says something about blacks, gays, Jews, Mexicans or Asians and he's a racist, homophobe or gay basher.  A Dem says the same thing and it was taken out of context.  What I think it may be is that we Republicans talk so much about values and morality, that when one Republican does something dumb it reflects on all of us.  Dems see the Rush Limbaughs and Pat Robertsons talking about living a moral and decent life and think that's the way we all live.  So when one does something and screws up, in their eyes, we all did it.  I've never claimed to live a decent life.  I've done things that I'm not proud of, things I wish I could change.  So don't think because the powerful Republicans talks about decency and morality, that we all live by their words.

       HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS   Here is one of the biggest examples of hypocrisy and double standards I've seen in some time.  The head of a civil rights advocacy group wants John Kerry to apologize for saying he wouldn't be upset if he could be known as the second black president.  Paula Diane Harris, founder of the Andrew Young National Center for Social Change, said  "John Kerry is not a black man - he is a privileged white man who has no idea what it is in this country to be a poor white in this country, let alone a black man" .  The quote in question is from an interview Kerry gave to American Urban Radio Network in which he said,  "President Clinton was often known as the first black president. I wouldn't be upset if I could earn the right to be the second" .   You know if any Republican, not just Bush, had said something like this the ACLU, NAACP and every black person in the country would be calling them insensitive, racist, bigot and would demand a public apology.  Yet, I only happened across this story by dumb luck.  Why isn't Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson all over the news calling for Kerry's head?

       NEW WASH POST/ABC POLL   In a recent Washington Post/ABC poll, Bush trails Kerry by something like 57%-43%.  That's not good news for W.  I know some say polls don't matter at this time, that they're only snapshots of the views at any one particular moment, but they do matter.  Bush is in trouble.  I'm beginning to see the fate of Howie D. make it's return.  Unless Kerry screws up monumentally, I feel he'll win.  I hope to God I'm wrong, but I can't allow myself to start believing that Bush will easily take this election.  Because I don't want to set myself up for what could be a huge disappointment.  What I'm really not looking forward to is the gloating that'll accompany who ever wins.  Gloating by both sides, but more so from Dems.  They have the more outspoken loudmouths, Martin Sheen, Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin and hundreds more.  This will be the worst election in recent history, win or lose.

       SOMEBODY CALL JOHNNY COCHRAN   Because we're going to need him.  Ousted Haitian president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, is planning on suing the United States and France for his kidnapping.  His lawsuits will be aimed at W's administration and the French Government.  During a news conference, Aristide said he's still the president of Haiti and is calling for "peaceful resistance" to what he called the occupation of Haiti.  This man's a damn loon.  I saw some of that news conference he gave in Africa.  Has anyone really looked at the man?  He even looks crazy.    In other news, John Kerry believes Aristide.  I posted yesterday about how ol' sour puss would have sent troops to Haiti without U.N. approval to stop the uprising.  Well, now Kerry's calling for an investigation into Aristide's claim that Marines kidnapped him and forced him out of power.  As dumb as Kerry is, you have to love the man.  If nothing else, he's good for a laugh.  And lastly, I need your help.  I was looking at a blog yesterday and I can't remember which one it was.  It had a post that had a Kerry campaign poster that said something like, "Kerry For President, Because You Can't Spell Victory Without VC".  If someone knows where that was please let me know.

       KERRY SUPPORTS TERRORISTS   In his 1997 book, "The New War", John Kerry called terrorist leader Yasser Arafat a "role model" and a "statesman".  Kerry's using this as proof of his own foresight about foreign policy.  But then he flipped yet again.  Eight days ago he told Jewish leaders in New York that he shares Bush's belief that Arafat must be isolated because he's not a "partner for peace"- much less a statesman.  God help us should he win.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing     ANOTHER FLIP-FLOP   In yet another Kerry flip-flop, he told the AAI, Arab American Institution, that Israel's security fence was a barrier to peace.  But later told Jewish leaders that the fence was "necessary to the security of Israel".  I can't wait for Bush to finally lay into this guy and expose him for the two-faced liar he really is.

       POLL TIME   And I think this will be the best poll I'll ever do. First, the story behind it.  Watching Leno the other night, he was talking about the report from Iran or Pakistan, I can't remember, about how the U.S. military has already caught bin Laden.  Then he made a joke about this not happening until Oct. or Nov., just in time for the election.  And it got me thinking.  When would I like to see bin Laden captured?  And I came up with two dates that I think would be great days.  So here's the question:   On What Day Would You Like To See bin Laden Captured?  A.  July 4, 2004 B. Sep. 11, 2004   Those are your choices, vote in the comments.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS   This use to be one of the most used headers for my posts, but I haven't done one in awhile.  But today I have a good one.  Why didn't the media pick up the story of Kerry's affair?  Because of no proof?  That can't be it.  They latched onto the Bush AWOL story like pitbulls on a ham bone with no proof.  That windbag Michael Moore and DNC stooge Terry McAuliffe make two unsubstantiated claims that Bush went AWOL and was a deserter.  No proof to back them up, yet the media clamped down on it.  No proof of Kerry's affair either, yet they just did nothing with it.  We could have Clinton Jr. in the White House and the media refuse to cover it.  We have a news anchor here who does stories about things that just don't jive right, and he has a phrase he says at the beginning of each story.  "Hey, what's the deal?"  I think that says it all.

       TEST THE NATION 2   I just finished taking the Test The Nation test.  If you don't know what that is, it's a test that's done on Fox that tests our IQ's.  You answer 60 questions and you figure out your IQ from that test.  Now, it's not scientific but it's actually pretty damn close.  I scored a 121, oh yeah.  Last year I think I got a 102, so I go smarter over the past year.  132 is a genius, I'm not a genius but I'm smarter than I thought.  I fell pretty good right now.  Here's some other results:  Men scored higher than women Bald people scored higher on average And for the second year running, Dems and Reps tied  If you want to take the test, go to www.testonfox.com    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       MARTHA'S GUILTY   This just in, Martha Stewart has been found guilty on all four charges.  One count of conspiracy, two counts of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice.  Each count carries up to four years in prison, so she's facing up to 20 years in prison.  Rapists don't even get that much time.  As I've stated before, this was just a witch hunt.  The Government just wanted to flex their muscles and Martha Stewart got caught in the crossfire.  It's sad.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       AND THAT'S THE TRUTH, RUTH    "I promise you this, if George Bush loses the election, Osama bin Laden wins the election, it's that simple. It will be interpreted that way by enemies of the United States around the world."   Rep. Tom Cole from my great state of Oklahoma said this a during a Canadian County Republican Convention here in Ok.  Have truer words ever been spoken?  If Kerry were to win in Nov, we would go back into the terrorist pattern of the 90's.  Kerry's a spineless jellyfish when it comes to the security of the American people, and he's proven that fact over the past 20 years.  While Kerry's taking his special interest money, we'll be getting attacked time after time.  We will once again be a weak nation.

       BUSH'S AD   By now you all know about the Dems newest bitch about Bush.  In one of his campaign ads he uses images of 9/11 to make the point of how well he has lead this country through one of the darkest times in our history.  The bitching and moaning's coming from people who don't like W in the first place and the praises are coming from people who do support W.  This really is a non-issue.  When Kerry used the Vietnam war for his political gain, did anyone complain?  Not to my knowledge.  Watching Crossfire yesterday, that arrogant ass Paul Begala was screaming at the Republican guest, I can't remember his name, that " KERRY FOUGHT IN VIETNAM ".  So I guess to Dems, the fact that Kerry fought in Vietnam gives him the right to pimp out the thousands upon thousands of American soldiers who lost their lives for his own political gain.    LOVE THOSE FRENCH   You all know about the terrorist threat in France where a group calling themselves the AZF were blackmailing the French Government for $5,000,000.  Unless the French paid up, they would blow up some train tracks.  Well, it seems that the French Government was ready to hand over the money.  Negotiating with terrorist.  Just like the French.

       TERRY McAULIFFE TO BE FIRED   John Kerry has said that if he wins in Nov. he will fire DNC chairmen Terry McAuliffe.  Kerry doesn't want to wait for McAuliffe to resign, he wants him out.  Everyone know that McAuliffe is a puppet of the Clintons, I guess Kerry wants his very own puppet.    APRES LA PARTIE D'Etats-Unis DE MORT   In case you don't speak French,  urlLink here's  a link to help read the header.  Anyway here's another example why the French are the butt of the world's jokes.  It seems that in France, you're able to marry dead people.  All you have to do is write president, who then forwards it to the justice minister, who then sends it to the prosecutor in whose jurisdiction the surviving person lives.  Love those French.    BUSH AND BLAIR NOMINATED   W and British PM Tony Blair have been nominated for the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize.  Nothing really more to say about this other than neither one will win.

       KERRY -VS- BUSH '04   It's official, it will be John Kerry taking on W for the job of president of the United States in Nov.  I know Kerry doesn't have all the delegates need for the nomination yet, but he's the only one running now.  John Edwards has finally smartened up and dropped out.  Yes, after his humiliating defeats Edwards has announced he will no longer run.  He follows in the footsteps of Clark, Dean, Gephardt and others.  Why don't Sharpton and Kucinich just do the smart thing and follow?  They're joke candidates.  Like the saying says, after a nuclear war the only thing left alive will be the roaches.  John Kerry's the nuclear war and Sharpton and Kucinich are the roaches.  In other news, Howie D won his first state.  No surprise it was Vermont, his home state.  They showed us, didn't they?  He got something like 9 delicates.  W can now put all his money and effort into slamming Kerry to the ground with his ads.  This is going to be a long year.  On a side note, I saw something very disheartening on MSNBC just now.  Bush could lose this election very easily.  All that has to happen is for W to lose just  one  state he won in 2000.  Missouri, Florida, New Mexico or any number of others.  But there could be a silver lining.  People are quick to dismiss California, I know I am.  But what if by some miracle Bush were to win California now that Arnold is Gov.?    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

Their recent one with U.S. soldiers kidnapping Aristide, W knew about 9/11 ahead of time, the Right-Wing conjured up the Monica/"Bubba" affair, Paul Wellstone was assassinated by terror groups linked to W.

       WE KIDNAPPED ARISTIDE   According to "Bubba's" handpicked dictator, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the U.S. kidnapped him and forced to leave power against his will.  Aristide reportedly called U.S. lawmakers and told them that U.S. Marines, in full battlegear, stormed his palace, kidnapped him and forced him to go to Africa.  Oh, I love this story.  And I love the people that'll believe it.  Let's see, that three evil asses out of power, Saddam, bin Laden and Aristide; Muammar Gaddafi has given up his nuclear program and S. Korea and Iran are willing to talk all because of W.  Way to go Mr. President.  That's: Terrorists 1 - Bush 6.

       THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE CANADIAN   First, the good.  There is a growing demand in Canada for the Fox New Channel.  The Canadian government steadfastly refuses to allow the Fox New Channel in Canada because under Canadian law every channel has to show a certain amount of Canadian programming.  Could you imagine the outcry from people here if something like this was done.  "Censorship" they would be crying.  It's not so much the average Canadian citizen, it's the media and the government that I don't like.  Both are extremely left-wing hate machines.    Now the bad.  We all know the story of the Canadian governments harboring the two army soldiers who went AWOL to their socialist bosom.  I wont' get into a whole long post about the Canadian government, that's not what this is about.  This is about those two cowards who ran up there to hide.  I love and respect the men and woman of the military, but these two are gutless pieces of crap.  And the Canadian government has just proven themselves not much better by letting these guys in there.  The Canadian press is a very left-wing American hating press.  The newspaper, The Toronto Globe and Mail, have leeched themselves onto these two gutless wonders in hopes of spinning their "story" to the Canadian people to "prove" that every man and woman in Iraq are against this war.  People like DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe and Mockumentry directory Michael Moore loved calling Bush a deserter, where are they now that we actually have two real deserters?  They're more than likely praising them and calling them heroes.  One last thing on this subject.  I'm I right in thinking that this action use to be punishable by death?  I'm being serious.  Wasn't deserting your post during war time punishable by execution?   Now the Canadian...boycott that is.  Bill O'Reilly is talking about boycotting Canadian goods just like he did the French.  Those two cowards I talked about in the last part are seeking asylum in Canada.  But for asylum to be granted they have to prove that they'll be killed if they return to America.  And since the most they would probably get is five years in prison, they're lives are in no danger.  If Canada grants these two asylum, O'Reilly is calling for a boycott of all Canadian goods in America.  I support this action 100%.  Granting asylum would be a direct slap in the face and undermind our efforts against terrorism even more so than they've already done.

       TWO NEW BLOGS FOR YOU   I've added two new blogs to the list.  DANEgerous and Armies Of Liberation.  Both are pretty good sites.  If you haven't heard of them, go check them out.  I think you'll like them.    NEW KERRY FLIP-FLOP   In light of suspected WMD production facility in Baghdad, disguised as a perfume factory, blowing up and killing two soldiers, John Kerry has flip-flopped on his stance on WMDs.  Before this incident, 'Ol Sourpuss was ranting and raving that no WMDs have been found and may never be found.  That Bush lied to the world.  But now he's singing a different tune.  On Hardball Tuesday, Kerry told Chris Matthews,   "Look, I want to make it clear. Who knows if a month from now, three months from now, you find some weapons? You may."  Faced with the now possible evidence of WMDs in Iraq, Kerry is reverting to his time honored tactics.  What's his next line going to be?  "I actually said Iraq had WMDs before I said they didn't."  Which he actually did.  So Kerry's flip-flopping on a flip-flop.  Damn, he's good.

       RICH POLITICIANS AND THE POOR MAN   Can someone please explain to me how these rich politicians can talk about helping and knowing the plights of the poor when most of them have never had less than $20 million in their entire lives.  I'm talking to John Kerry and George W. Bush.  Even the ones who were born poor, Bill Clinton and John Edwards, have been rich so long they can't even possibly remember what it's like to struggle to make ends meet.  I live in a mobile home park.  I'm not poor poor, but I am in the lower class tax bracket.  I don't need for anything, I'm able to get everything that I need to live on but there's millions out there that are unable to.  These "leaders" set up there in the multi-million dollar homes and try to figure out how they can help us.  How they can make life better for us poor folk.  "Let's reform welfare."  "Let's raise minimum wage by a quarter and hour."  No, you know how you can help us?  Quit wasting our goddamned money on stupid shit and spend it on giving us a better education.  We have one of the worst educational systems on Earth.  We're supposed to be this great and powerful nation, but our teachers are under paid and schools in this country are abysmal.  They waste our money on the most asinine things like $9,000,000 for various improvements to the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, $1,000,000 for the WesStart Vehicular Flywheel Project(what ever that is), $18,500,000 added by the House for the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) in support of the Anglo-Irish Accord and $15,000,000 added by the House for dairy development programs overseas under the U.S. Agency for International Development just to name .000001% of the waste.  That right there is $43,500,000 wasted that could have went to something worthwhile, like schools or hospitals.  That's how they can help us po' folk,   STOP WASTING OUR MONEY   Credit for the money figures:   urlLink CAGW      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       McDERMOTT AND THE PLEDGE   By now we all know about Rep. McDermott omitting the words "Under God" from the pledge when he lead it.  That doesn't worry me.  Leave it in or take it out when you recite it.  It doesn't matter to me.  But what ticks me off is this show of disrespect by not placing his hand over his heart when he did it.  That was screwed up.  Men and women have given their lives for what that flag represents, and for him to not place his hand over his heart is a slap in the face to them and this country.  But what can you expect from someone who went to Iraq before the war and gave comfort to the enemy.  Can someone say "treason"?

       LATEST ARTWORK   The inspiration for this pic came to me when a few days ago I saw a poll that asked why people will be voting for John Kerry.  The number one answer was still "He's not Bush".  That's the main reason a lot of people will be voting this year.  And it got me to thinking about how much these Dems are like sheep.  They just follow 'Ol Sourpuss like he's their master.  Can you guess which one's the Ted Kennedy sheep?  Also, I wanted to make them look like they were brain dead zombies, but just couldn't get it right.  So enjoy my latest "artwork".

       ABC CONTROLLED BY RNC   According to John Kerry, the alphabet network is run by the RNC.  After his appearance on GMA, 'Ol Sourpuss grumbled   "God, they're doing the work of the Republican National Committee"  Was this planned or is John Kerry so stupid that he doesn't even know when a microphone is on or off?  I'm going with the latter explanation.  When I read the headline, I actually choked on my breath.  This is priceless.   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      THIS IS SICK AND PATHETIC   Get aload of this crap.  The Independent Media Center has gone over the line of what it means to be human.  One of their branches in Oregon wrote and article about the death of Pat Tillman and called it "Dumb Jock Killed in Afghanistan".  Read some of the comments posted by it's kind-hearted love-filled Liberals.   "Tillman chose to go to Afghanistan. He's partially reponsible for the deaths of hundreds, maybe thousands of Afghan civilians. No need to feel sorry for him, other than feeling bad that he was brainwashed into serving as a grunt."  "it's amazing the kind of attention this insignificant incident is going to cause. well, he was rich, white, and an american. 10,000 (brown) iraqis get killed, and it barely merits a mention in the american news. how utterly f---ing sad."  "if he 'sacrificed' anything it was his common sense. He had a good American thing going and blew it."  That's your Democratic party of today at work there.

       MILLION MURDER MARCH      That's a picture from this weekends big pro-abortion march.  One question.  Why are some so afraid to call it abortion?  Some absolutely refuse to call it abortion.  They will only call it pro-choice.  Could it be because the definition of abort means to discard of?  Here's something that just sticks in my crawl.  The lefties love to talk pro-choice this and pro-choice that.  It's not their choice to make.  It's not my choice, it's not Jakes choice to make, it's not Brians choice to make.  It's not the moms or dads choice to make.  It's that babies choice to make.  Ask that baby if he or she wants to die.  Give him or her the choice.  It's their life.

       THEY JUST DON'T GET IT   Watching H&C earlier and Alan Colmes was foaming at the mouth talking about how we Republicans have latched onto a 33 year old story.  That somehow we can't let the past stay in the past.  Do the Democrats really believe this is about what happened over 30 years ago?  No, what this is about is honesty and character.  Which John Kerry has neither.  Same with Bill Clinton.  Do Dems really think we're pissed off at him because he got his jollies with an intern?  Well, yes, in some ways that is it.  He was the president of the United States and he conducted himself like a jackass.  But what that whole thing was about, for me anyway, was the fact that Bill Clinton lied under oath.  A crime.  Dems like to call Bush a criminal, they need only to look to their hero for a criminal.  No, this isn't about something that happened over 30 years ago or a blowjob.  This is about having someone with integrity as our leader.  Bush has it, Kerry doesn't.    IS THIS HYPOCRISY?   John Kerry not too long ago attacked Dick Cheney and Carl Rove, as "going out of their way to avoid Vietnam".  He slammed and blasted them for that.  I wonder why he didn't go after the Liberal Lord and Savior Bill Clinton and Howard Dean as well?  Didn't "Bubba" run to England under the guise of "education"?  And Howie D. got out of service by skiing the slopes of Colorado with a screwed up back.  Is that Double Standard I smell?

       JOHN KERRY'S AN ASSHOLE   I was just watching FoxNews and they were talking about Kerry's appearance on GMA this morning.  How can he be blaming this whole medal thing on the GOP?  It was Big Media that found this out, not the VR-WC.  In one interview he said he threw away his medals, but then later he said he only threw away his ribbons.  In the interview he gave this morning he said that medals and ribbons were interchangeable, but in an interview he gave before that he said there as difference in the two.  Then he goes after Bush's National Guard record after he said he wouldn't and even called for his supporters to not go after it.  He once said that he didn't throw his own medals away only because he couldn't get home and get them, but now says that he is proud of his service and his protests.  You have to admit that Kerry is the consummate politician.  Taking both sides while taking no side at all.  Bush said it best about Kerry.  If he could take a third side, he would.  He has no respect for the military.  No wonder the overwhelming majority of our men and women in the armed forces support Bush.

       LOOK WHAT WE FOUND        The VR-WC have been doing some secret covert ops.  Last week we were able to infiltrate the Kerry Campaign HQ and we found this filecabinet.  It was locked and they couldn't get it open, that's why there's no pics of the files inside.  This could be very damning to 'Ol Sourpuss's bid for the White House.  Sadly, I wasn't able to go on this mission.  I had to mow my yard, but you damn well bet I'll be on the next one.

       TRUTH ON KERRY'S COMBAT RECORD?   Recently, John Kerry's website posted his combat records.  But it seems there's something wrong with them.  I don't feel like typing all of this, so go to the site and read it.  It's very interesting.  What I'm wondering is, this story is two days old.  How come Big Media hasn't got a hold of it yet?  Remember how they latched onto Bush's National Guard record story?  Could they be trying to cover for 'Ol Sourpuss?   Credit:   urlLink Boston Globe      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing      KERRY CAUGHT IN YET ANOTHER LIE   We all remember the brew-ha-ha over the report that after the Vietnam War 'Ol Sourpuss threw his medal away at a protest rally.  Then Kerry said those weren't his real medal and said that he never implied that he threw his own medals during the protest.  Then on his blog there was a headline that read "RIGHTWING FICTION" that talked about it.  Well, ABC's Good Morning America set to air an interview with Kerry that was done in 1971 where Kerry says that he did indeed throw away his medals.  Lies upon lies just keep building up in the Kerry Camp.   Credit:   urlLink Drudge      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       THIS IS AN OUTRAGE   Crap Rapper Andre 3000 from the group Outkast is set to play the greatest rocker of all time Jimi Hendrix.  This is a disgrace to the memory of Hendrix.  I love Jimi, but there is no way in burning pits of hell I would ever watch this movie.  VH1 made a Hendrix movie that was good, I think I'll stick to that one.    MAKES SENSE TO ME   Reading the   urlLink Tulsa World   yesterday and they had a story about exchange students that live here and they get use to the differences between the counties.  One of the kids they talked to was from Germany who has lived here for three years and still finds it unusual to add sales tax to stuff he buys.  It seems over in Europe the sales tax is already added to the labeled price.  My God, how much more sense does that make then the way we do it here?  A hell of a lot.  I hate going to Wal-Mart and seeing something that cost $19.95 and I have say $22 with me.  Can I afford it?  I have to get out the old calculator and add up the sales tax to find it ends up being something like $25.  But if I can't figure that out I take to the product up to the checkout and find out I don't have enough and then I'm embarrassed in front hundreds of people.  No thank you.  The price should say $24.93 - Tax Included.  I'm not big on emulated what Europe does, but this is one thing I could live with.

       BIZARRE WITH A CAPITAL B   If you've been paying attention to the weather reports then you know we around this area have been getting slammed daily with storms.  Yesterday was no exception, but something weird happened during last nights round.  Storms were forming not more than 30 miles from my home town.  We had a bullseye painted right on us.  These storms were headed dead center for us.  They got within 10 miles then broke up.  This was a tornatic storm as it was heading towards us.  After it broke apart and passed us, it reformed and hit the town right next to us with a tornado.  Weird, right?  Well, it gets a little weirder.  Some years ago, my sister-in-law told me that this town was blessed by the Indians who lived here.  Supposedly they blessed this area so that it would never get hit with huge storms like the one that was coming this way.  Now I never really believed it until yesterday.  There is no other explanation for what happened.  It was the strangest and most amazing thing I had ever seen.    NEW BLOG FOR SOME   For those of you interested in the Toomey/Specter race,   urlLink here's   a blog you might like.    HOW DO YOU SPELL HYPOCRISY?      That's how.

       ARE YOU A STAR WARS GEEK?   If you're a geek like me, then chances are that you're a fanboy/girl of Star Wars.  I was reading in the paper today and came across a pretty cool article about Star Wars.  If you're a fan, then you know that in September the original trilogy will be coming out on glorious DVD.  Well, in the piece I was reading it talked about a bonus that'll come with it.    "Fans can get a first look at the new Darth Vader costume from the 2005 'Star Wars: Episode III' prequel on the upcoming DVD collection of the original trilogy.  The Darth Vader featurette promises an interview with creator George Lucaus discussing how Jedi warrior Anakin Skywalker became the fearsome space villain"  Now I know some don't like the new prequels, but I do.  I think they're pretty good.  Not a good as the original trilogy obviously, but good just the same.  I can't wait for this DVD, and I can't wait for Episode III.

       DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO   "Being responsible about the environment is not some goo-goo, do-gooder, silly notion that you embrace once a year on Earth Day.  It's important to life itself."   That's from a speech that 'Ol Sourpuss gave to a Florida crowd slamming W on the environment.  What Kerry forgot to tell the audience is that he and his wife own a gas guzzling private jet, an energy-eating power yacht, have five mansions that consume thousands of gallons of oil to heat and cool - and keep a fleet of SUVs running night-and-day outside their Beacon Hill mansion.  How many gallons of gas is Kerry using a day?  And how much pollution is all that gas consumption causing?  How do you spell hypocrisy?  K-E-R-R-Y, that's how.

       GREAT PICS         Found these two pictures that I thought most of you would like.  Can you guess which one's my favorite?  Here's a hint, it's the one I wish I had in my bathroom right now.  Enjoy.    COULD IT HELP BUSH?   Could all these attacks be helping W in the long run?  We see Kerry all over the t.v. bashing Bush, we see Richard Clarke and the Kangaroo Commission, we see Bob Woodward's new book.  All these are attacking Bush almost constantly and I have a feeling that the American people could start to turn on the attackers.  They may begin to sympathize with Bush.  According to a new poll, Bush is ahead of Kerry 48% - 41%.    BUSH AND GAS   Does anyone else see the future on this story?  Kerry believes that Woodward's new book claims that Bush has a underhanded deal with the Saudi's for gas prices to be lowered sometime in October.  I can see the future.  When gas prices do start to lower after the Summer months, like they always do, Kerry and the Democratic Attack Machine will latch onto this and be all over the airwaves screaming, "I told you, I told you".

       I have no title for this post.  I couldn't think of one that would do it justice.  I just got done watching Band Of Brothers that I taped last night.  The episode where Easy Company found the concentration camp.  6,000,000 Jews killed.  Look at that number again and study on it.  6,000,000.  All killed for no other reason other than they were Jewish.  Adolf Hitler ordered the genocide of these people.  Not to mention the 5,000,000 other ethnic minorities that were butchered.  So, in total, over 11,000,000 human beings killed by the orders of one man.  That's roughly the population of New York City.  So someone, anyone, please tell me how on God's green Earth can someone compare George W. Bush to Adolf Hitler?  If I could put forth my true emotion towards this in type I would, but I can't.  Every time I hear or see some fucked up piece of shit say George W. Bush is just as bad or worse than Adolf Hitler I want to take a baseball bat to base of their skull.  There has never been a bigger monster on this planet than Adolf Hitler.  If anyone can show me an instance where Bush has ordered the extinction of a group of people then I'll be right on the front lines of these protest marches.  Watching this episode I broke down twice.  Once when they first entered the camp and the second when one of the "prisoners" told them why there were there.  "Jude, Jude"  Jew, Jew.  I makes me sick when I see these assholes carrying these signs that say "Adolf Bush" or whatever else their small little minds can come up with.

       168         Today marks nine years since the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City.  I don't use the word anniversary like some because an anniversary is something you celebrate, and this isn't something to celebrate.  It seems that over the past nine years the memory of OKC bombing has started to fade away just a little.  Which is in someways is both good and bad.  Good because it means we've been able to move on with our lives and bad because we may begin to forget the events and feelings of that day.  Up until Sep. 11, 2001, April 15, 1995 was the worst terrorist attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor.  I remember that day very well.  I was in tenth grade and was just going into second period pre-algebra.  They had the t.v on and everyone was watching it.  I sat there and watched it and the reporters were talking about people miles away being able to feel the rumble of the blast and I wondered if anyone in my home town had felt it.  Of course I live just north of 100 miles away, but I still wondered.  I remember when the above picture came out in the papers.  I don't think I need to describe what my feelings are, I'm sure they're the exact same as yours.  What's sad is that nine years later, the aftermath of that day is still going on.  One of the sons of bitches responsible for it is dead, but the state trial of the other is just getting underway.  No matter the outcome of this trial, at least he'll spend the rest of his life in prison getting gangrapped by his new friends.    TWO NEW LINKS   I've found two sites you might like.  Have you ever heard a song in a commercial and liked it but didn't know the name of it?  I found two sites that might help you out.  They're in the  Entertainment  section.  Enjoy.

       NONSENSE   Nothing to talk about today, so I thought I would just post some random things.  It's not so much a Random Thoughts post as it is a I'm Bored To Death Post.  When are people going to wake up and realize that Michael Jackson is a mentally disturbed man who should not be allowed to keep his kids?  The plastic surgeries should have been the wake-up call everyone needed.  I feel sorry for his three kids.  If he's allowed to raise them like he is, they're going to grow even more screwed up than he is.  Same with Al Franken and his freedom.  He's a very disturbed man who's way out of touch with reality.  He should be locked up.  Why is racism still allowed on T.V.?  I'm not talking about racism against minorities, I'm talking about racism against whites.  Have you ever watched Chappell Show on Comedy Central?  Nothing but a thirty minute racism fest.  Watch other shows and comics.  It's okay for a black comic to crack jokes and do moronic impressions of whites, but God forbid a white comic to the same to a black.  Or any race for that matter.  Black face is considered racist, but white face is okay.  Example, Ted Danson did black face at a Friars Roast one year.  People when ape shit over it.  Rapper Busta Rhymes does a video as a white man, acts like a jackass during it, and no body says a word.  Same way with racial slurs.  Honky, cracker and whitey are allowed and okay, but a white guy says any racial slur towards a minority and wrath of P.C. comes down on him with a vengeance.  Why are people comparing Iraq to Vietnam?  Well, I know why.  They want Bush to loose in Nov.  But Iraq is nothing like Vietnam.  During the Vietnam war we lost as many men in one day as we've lost in one year.  Plus, in Vietnam, it was a country wide revolt.  In Iraq it's only been in one area.  The whole country of Iraq isn't rising up against us.  Also during 'Nam, the politician were running the war.  The soldiers are running the war in Iraq.  There are no comparisons between Vietnam and Iraq.  But don't tell the Democrats that.  Why are Dems so quick to believe people like Richard Clarke and Bob Woodward.  Clarke has been proven wrong time and again, but I guess the truth is a mute point to Dems.  Woodward is known for his objectiveness, right.  He's has no ideological tendencies towards a Republican president, does he?  Clarke is just a disgruntled man with an ax to grind and Woodward is trying to hock his book.  Direct quote from Michael Moore:   "The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not "insurgents" or "terrorists" or "The Enemy." They are the REVOLUTION, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow -- and they will win."   Wow, the revolution.  Refer two paragraphs up.  Moore is truly an asshole.  He wants our soldiers to die.    More on Moore.  You want to talk about a hypocrite.  He goes around the country in his limos and private jets talking about the plight of the poor, blue collar, working class.  He sends his kids to private schools.  And in one of the biggest examples of hypocrisy, he owns a gun.  He talks about the evils of people who own guns, and just recently he stopped a burglar with one.  Damn.

       IS IT REALLY GLOBAL WARMING?   Okay, thanks to   urlLink Brian   for the idea of this post.  The Left-wing wackos love to go on and on about "Global Warming".  About how we are causing the world to warm, which causes the polar ice caps to melt and climates to change drastically.  First a quick fact.  The temp of the Earth has risen  one degree  over the past 100 years.  But here's where I'm going with this.  I was watching Discovery Science channel the other day, a program called something like "If We Had No Moon".  It talked about what would happen to Earth had our moon never formed.  It was a good show.  Kind of scary seeing what our world would be like.  And one of the effects of no moon would be a very different climate.  Africa could be covered in snow.  Antarctica would be a dessert of sand instead of snow.  They dropped some knowledge on me too.  The moon is moving away from the Earth.  It's a fact.  Not a massive move.  Something like one centimeter ever year or something like that, but it is pulling away.  The moon controls our axis.  Without the moon our axis of rotation would be way out of wack.  Could this be a cause in the one degree temp change?  Maybe.  I'm no scientist, but I watch t.v.  If you ever get a chance to see the show, watch it.

       THEN TAKE YOUR ASS BACK HOME   John Kerry's wife fumed yesterday at NY Posts Cindy Adams,   "I can't believe my family left Africa and came to this country.  I can't believe I ever even married an American."   Nothing's stopping her from going back.  Pack your $5,000 luggage and hop your ass back to Africa.  And take 'Ol Sourpuss with you while you're at it.   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      BUSH IS CAUSE OF "CENSORSHIP"?   Can someone please explain to me how Bush is being blamed for this rash of "censorship" that's been going around.  I say "censorship" because it's not censorship.  People are bitching and moaning because they can't show their tits on national t.v or say fuck or shit on the radio.  Oh dear Lord, call the cops.  But I'm talking about this Howard Stern crap.  He's all over his radio show blaming Bush for Clear Channel dropping him.  How?  Does Bush own Clear Channel?  Did he tell the president of Clear Channel that he would be shot if he doesn't drop Stern?  I'm confused.  Stern, on his website, blasted Bush and Republicans as wanting to invade your homes and bedrooms.  And this I had to laugh at.  He said of John Ashcroft,   "Ashcroft is out of control. He's looking to invade your bedroom. He doesn't want you watching porno. He doesn't want you looking at statues. He doesn't want you watching HBO. He doesn't want you to hear this show. It's absolutely out of control."   Wow.  I can understand the porno part, but HBO?  When did he say that.  Howard Stern is a washed up has-been that's just trying to hold on to his stale show.

       I'M A RACIST   This post is inspired by   urlLink Brian's   post  Playing The Role  that talks about some frog giving a speech in California in which he called the campaign by Rupurt Murdoch to smear the French as racist.  I went looking around the net for some French jokes, and found and few that I'm going to post here.  Enjoy.  Q: What do you call a Frenchman advancing on Baghdad? A: A salesman  Q: Is it rude to call a Frenchman a frog? A: Yes, it is unfair to amphibians  Q: How are French babies born?  A: With their hands up (has to be my favorite one)  Q: How many generations does it take to learn ingratitude? A: Trois  Donald Rumsfeld was being heckled by a French anti-war weenie when he suddenly turned and asked the Frenchman:  "Excuse me. Do you speak German?" The Frenchman replied "No." Rumsfeld looked him in the eyes and said "You're welcome."  Q: What do you call a man who only needs body armor on his back? A: Jacques Chirac  You really do have to hand it to the French... After all, they won't fight for it  Q: How many Frenchmen does it take to screw in a lightbulb? A: One, Chirac. He stands still and Europe revolves around him  Q: How many Frenchmen does it take to screw in a lightbulb? A: It doesn't matter; if you're depending on the French to do the job, it's screwed anyway  Q: What do you call 100,000 Frenchmen with their hands up? A: The Army  And now some quotes:  "I just love the French. They taste like chicken!" ---- Hannibal Lecter  "We can stand here like the French, or we can do something about it." ---- Marge Simpson  "France has neither winter nor summer nor morals. Apart from these drawbacks it is a fine country. France has usually been governed by prostitutes."  ---Mark Twain  "I would rather have a German division in front of me than a French one behind me." --- General George S. Patton  And just for clarification, I've never like the French.  Long before the War On Terror entered Iraq, I hated the French.  This isn't a new thing.  Now, I want everyone to go out on the net and find your favorite French joke and post them in the comments.  There's no prize for the best one, except for the pride you'll have.

       MORE BAD NEWS FOR TERRORISTS AND DEMS   The terrorist kidnapper in Iraq are demanding that Italy withdraw it's troops from Iraq or more hostages will die.  But PM Berlusconi says that will not happen.  He's showing what devotion and honor is all about.  These terrorists just can't win.  You take some hostages and make demands, but the world for the most part just doesn't cooperate with you.  Damn.  A couple of you may be wondering why I added Dems to the headline.  Because the majority of Democrats in this country would love nothing more than for all of our allies to leave Iraq so we would be forced to bring in the U.N.    WHAT'S SHE HIDING?   My hands starting to hurt, so I'll make this a quickie.  John Kerry is calling for a full discloser of W's tax returns.  All the while his wife is holding steadfast to not releasing hers.  Why?  Is she trying to hide something?  There's growing pressure for Mrs. Kerry to release them.  Read the article.

       WHY IS HE SO STUPID?   Watching some of 'Ol Sour Puss's news conference today on FoxNews, until they took him off for more of the Kangaroo Commission.  And during his diatribe about Bush and Iraq he brought up the Democrat Talking Point about going into Iraq "unilaterally".  I guess Kerry hasn't read my blog yet.  What are all those names over on the left?  According to John Kerry, they're "window dressing".     Window Dressing - Noun - Circa 1895 - Decorative exhibition of retail merchandise in store windows   So, according to John Kerry, all the soldiers from those countries who have given their lives for the freedom of the Iraqi people are nothing more than decorative property that Bush put on display.  It's sick that Kerry would even think something like that.  But, then again, what can you expect from a guy who doesn't even respect the military?  From any country it appears.

Martin Luther King, Jr.  I've added him because he preached change through peace and understanding while others did it through violence and hate.  The link goes to the MLK Foundation.

       THE GOOD GUYS WIN ONE   You all may remember a post I did not too long ago about how Jeb Bush wanted to reward illegal aliens with legal drivers licenses.  Well it appears that plan is dying.  There has been a massive outcry in by Florida sheriffs and constituents to not let this happen.    Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      PERSONAL POST   Sorry for the short blips of posts lately.  I've been having some pain in my right arm and hand.  If I bend it the wrong way I get this intense pain shoot though my hand like it's being stabbed.  Now I think it may only be a pinched nerve, but I have a feeling it may be the beginnings of carpal tunnel.  So I've had to lay off the keyboard a little bit.  I was at the computer for only 30 minutes yesterday, and I haven't had pain all day.  I spend way too much time on this confound contraption anyway.  So hopefully it'll heal up soon.

       RESOLVES REMAINS STRONG   More bad news for the Dems.  It seems that this recent rash of kidnappings in Iraq isn't stopping our true allies from supporting efforts to help out.  Both S. Korea and Japan are committing more troops to Iraq.  Kerry and the Dems would love nothing more than for all of our allies to pull out of Iraq.  Doesn't look like it's going to happen.    DEAD OR ALIVE, YOU'RE COMING WITH ME   Line from Robocop.  The U.S. has put out a hit on terrorists Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.  al-Sadr is the "man" behind this small group of Shi'ite's who think they can get rid of us by kidnapping innocent people and holding them hostage.  But listening to the Dems, the small group of Shi'ite's is spread out all over Iraq and not in just one area.  My pick, kill the son of a bitch.    BUSH SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE RACIST   According to the NY Slimes, after Bush received the 8/6 PDB he should have ordered airlines to screen passengers to make sure people who fit the airlines' threat profiles were being prevented from boarding American planes.  Or, in other words, Racial Profiling.  Which in the past the NY Slimes has condemned.  Could you image the headline had Bush done this?

       DAMN JANET JACKSON   And her "Wardrobe Malfunction".  Because she had to go out and get some publicity for her crappy album, the Victoria Secret Fashion Show has been dropped.  Ever since she had to show her nipple on live network t.v., everything has been gone over with a fine tooth comb.  Some things I agree with, Howard Stern for one, but when they cancel the fashion show that's when I get mad.  Like I said, there are some things that I agree with, but people do need to calm down just a little.  It's just lingerie, no nudity.  Although I can understand.  This is shown on national t.v., and some people don't think it belongs there.  I'm not going to attack them for that belief, I'm just going to disagree with it.   Credit:   urlLink Yahoo! News      JOHN KERRY HATES JEWS   That's the message I get from this story.  In December, 'Ol Sour Puss spoke at the annual convention of the group Muslim Public Affairs Council.  A know anti-Semitic organization.  This MPAC has defended such terrorist, Jew-hating organizations as Hamas and Hezbollah.  Kerry told MPAC,   "I really want to earn support of Muslim leaders across the United States"   He's already go the support of people like Kim Jong Ill and Osama bin Laden, why not go after the support of people like Lewis Farrakhan.  If Bush were to meet with known members of the KKK, the left would be screaming "racist" at the top of their lungs.  But Kerry meets with an anti-Semitic group four months ago, and nothing.  It's your classic Hypocrisy and Double Standards at play.   Credit:   urlLink FrontPage Magazine      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       THE AUGUST 6 PDB    "Clandestine, foreign government, and media reports indicate Bin Laden since 1997 has wanted to conduct terrorist attacks in the US," the memo to Bush stated. Bin Laden implied in U.S. television interviews in 1997 and 1998 that his followers would follow the example of World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and "bring the fighting to America"     Well, there you have it.  Concrete proof that Bush knew about 9/11 as early as August 6th.  It says a clear as day, "al Qaeda wants to use airplanes to attack the WTC on September 11, 2001.  Looks like the Left were right.  bin Laden wanted to do this as early as 1997.  Even though Bush wasn't in office yet, he's to blame for this.  He should have done something about this in '98.  Damn him.  Okay, that's enough of that.  bin Laden wanted to hijack planes and use them to blackmail us into releasing some blind sheik.  How the Looney Left can read Bush knew about 9/11 in that is beyond me.  Maybe Jake can help me out with this problem.

       CLINTON KNEW ABOUT SEPTEMBER 11   Well, sort of.  With all this hoopla about this August 6 PDB that the left want declassified, where's the same outrage for Clinton to release documents that stated terrorists linked to Osama bin Laden planned a "spectacular attack" that involved kamikaze pilots crashing U.S. airliners into targets that included the Pentagon, the Capitol building and significant U.S. skyscrapers?  These warnings were so well known that they were covered by the media.  Hypocrisy and Double Standards.  Read the article.   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      U.S. BIGGER THREAT THAN TERRORISM   According to a BBC poll, enough said right there, 52% of BBC views world wide feel that the U.S. and globalization pose a bigger threat than does war and terrorism.  Other threats on the list were:  Corruption came in second place War and Terrorism came in third with 50% Hunger came in fourth with 49% and Climate Change in fifth with 44%  Got to love those "progessives".  We're a bigger threat to the world than starvation.  We need to be stopped before they can even tackle little babies starving to death.  Saddam kills hundreds of thousands of people?  Well, he'll have to wait his turn.  Climate change, globalization and corruption I couldn't really give a rats ass about.  They forgot AIDS on that list.  How many people has AIDS killed worldwide?

I guess they got us mistaken with the French or Spanish.  We don't bow down to terrorists.  Bush isn't Clinton.  If anything happens to this American hostage, Bush will send double the forces into Falluja and make these people wish they had never messed with us.

       MARK MY WORDS   I want someone to write this down and put it somewhere safe.  Clinton and Gore have finally went before the 9/11 Kangaroo Commission.  But it was in private.  They didn't give public testimony.  And not a word was said about it.  But I guarantee that when Bush and Cheney give their testimony to the commission, the left will be screaming bloody murder that they're doing it in private and not public.  There will be a massive uproar for them to give public testimony.  The same way they did with Condi Rice.  The murdering lush will be screaming all over the airwaves and 'Ol Sour Puss will get his panties in a tizzy over it.

       RANDOM THOUGHTS THE 5TH   Yes ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the fifth installment of random thoughts.  For those of you who don't know what this is, it's a post I do every once and awhile when there's nothing to blog on.  I just talk about what's on my mind and spout random nonsense.  Much like I do with my regular posts.    You know, Eric Clapton said it best.  "After midnight, we're going to let it all hand down"  Have you seen the 2005 Ford Mustangs?  These damn things are ugly as hell.  Why do car companies have to screw up cars like this?  Have you ever noticed that when you can't scratch yourself is when you have the biggest itch of your life  Veni, Vidi, Viblogged  I miss Christmas.  Hurry up December     What the hell is up with this crap?  When did actual talent become relative  I love my country  I still want a Hummer.  And not that wussy H2 either.  I want the gas guzzling, road hogging, EPA deathmachine monster that pisses the hippies off  The majority of people in the country are big people.  Why do companies still make products for skinny people only?  I wonder why Oklahoma is still holding out on making tattoo parlors legal.  I mean I can just go over to Arkansas or Texas and get one.  It's dumb  I love my dog.  He's a white and brown Shih Tzu called Dee-Jay  I wish Doom 3 would hurry up and come out  When is Michelle Malkin going to get her own show on FoxNews  Well, that's all for today.  These things are getting harder and harder to do.  It's not easy coming up with new stuff to talk about.

Hailing from parts unknown.  He's the failed former Terrorism Czar under President's Clinton and W. Bush.  Richard Clarke.  Ladies and gentlemen, this should be a great match.  Clarke comes out swinging first.  He lobs left blow after left blow to Dr. Rice.  OH, Clarke just hit Dr. Rice with a lowblow about how she seemed like she never even heard about al Qaida before Clarke told her about them.  Whoa, here comes Dr. Rice with upper cut after upper cut to Clarke.  Clarke's hanging onto the ropes.  It doesn't look good for Richard Clarke.  Oh!

You may remember my March 29 post that talked about Clinton and Gore being the only non-office-holders to not agree to even meet with the commission.  Even in private.  Well it seems Clinton will for once in his life stand up and be a man.  I tried to find the story for you, but they don't have it up yet.  I'm sure you'll hear more about this in the coming days.  Now, here's the $25,000 question.  Will Clinton tell the truth?  We all know that the Clintons and the truth are like vampires and sunlight.

       DAMN   I don't directly copy from other blogs too often, but sometimes they say it better than I do.  This is from Troy over at   urlLink Stark Truth  .    "You Think Our Unemployment Rate Is Bad? We are at 5.7% And you liberals look to Europe for us to follow? You long for us to be more European? For 2002, the unemployment rate for Belgium was 7.2%, France was 9.1%, Germany was 9.8%, Spain was 11.3%. There you have it, your heroes, the socialists that John Kerry and the left embrace."    We should be more like Europe?  I don't think so.  And how dare the Governments of France and Germany criticize our economy.  They can't take care of their own people, but they think they know what's best for us?  Again, I don't think so.  If our unemployment rate went up to 9.1% like the lovable French, people would be shitting their pants.

       GREATER WORDS WERE NEVER SPOKEN    "Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.  This much we pledge - and more.  To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United, there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do - for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.  To those new States whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom - and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.  To those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required - not because the Communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich."    Who said those words?  Ronald Reagan, Bush Sr., Bush Jr.?  No.  It was none other than the only half-way decent Democratic President, and Ted "Murdering Lush" Kennedy's brother, John F. Kennedy in his 1961 inaugural address.  They kind of make you think.  What's happened to this country.  People use to stand behind our troops.  Not anymore.  There are Americans out there right now who are happy because our troops are being killed.  They would love nothing more than for our efforts in Iraq to fail.  Kennedy said,   "we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty"   But Ted Kennedy is calling this Vietnam.  Why?  Does he not agree with the word of his own brother?  The man Democrats hold as the greatest president of 20th Century.  It took us four years to rebuild Germany after WWII.  That's four years we "occupied" the country.  We've been in Iraq for just a little over a year.  Do these people truly believe we should be pulling out now?  If they do, they're dumber than I ever could have imagined.  Pay any price, bear any burden.  We're American's, that's our job.  For better or for worse, we're the police of the world.  Think of us as the big brother.  If you need us, we'll be there.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       ENOUGH IS ENOUGH   This post will be short and to the point.  It's time we went into the Sunni Triangle fast and hard.  The time for pussyfooting around in Iraq is over and done with.  12 more U.S. soldiers were killed today, bringing the three day total to something like 30 dead.  We've been walking on eggshells for a year now hoping that we wouldn't make the Iraqi people angry.  Well, fuck that.  Ever since that attack on the three contractors it's gotten worse in that area.  It's time for a area wide curfew, and if anyone is caught violating that curfew, too bad.  Shot on site.  Our soldiers lives are in danger, they don't have the time or luxury to stop and ask them what they're doing.  I could care less if the Iraqi people like us or not right now.

       A MASSIVE MISTAKE   Jeb Bush strongly endorsed allowing illegal aliens in Florida to obtain drivers licenses.  They would have to go through a "rigorous screening procedure" before being issued a licenses.  What the fucking hell?  Can anyone say, "pandering to the Cubans"?  Did he learn nothing from California?  Pandering for votes didn't work there, and it's not going to work in Florida.  I am sick and tired of these politician doing crap like this.  You can put up all the screening procedures you can think of, it doesn't matter.  Someone will get through.  He can sugar coat this all he wants, it's nothing more than trying to win over the Latinos in Florida.  Damn.   Credit:   urlLink Miami Herald      BABIES FEEL PAIN DURING MURDER, I MEAN ABORTION    According to Dr. Kanwaljeet "Sonny" Anand, a pediatrician at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, a 20-week-old baby that's being killed during a "partial birth abortion" may just feel pain during the procedure.    "I believe the fetus is conscious."    Said Dr. Anand.  He added that the fetuses, I hate that word, it's a baby, show increased heart rate, blood flow and hormone levels in response to pain during the process of being killed.    "The physiological responses have been very clearly studied.  The [baby] cannot talk ... so this is the best evidence we can get."      WARNING.  The following may be too graphic for some.  Which is why I have made the text white.  Just highlight it to read it.    During the procedure, which doctors call "intact dilation and extraction" or D&X, a fetus is partially removed from the womb  and its skull is punctured . It is generally performed in the second trimester.   I hope Bush wins in Nov. and outlaws this practice of infantile genocide.

       PERSONAL POST   There's nothing happening that I want to post on, so I though I would just make a stale old personal post.  Had to go out and buy a new lawnmower yesterday.  The old one kept getting flooded when I would use it.  I had to drain the damn thing every time I wanted to use it.  So I finally said, "To hell with it.  I buying a new one".  Spent $120 on a new mower, that's smaller than the one I had before.  Have you ever put one of these damn things together?  It's harder than hell when you don't have a work bench or something at least waist high to work on.  I had to put this thing on my porch and assemble it there.  No fun at all.  The whole time I was wishing I had a socket set.  Had to use a pair of old pliers that aren't too good.  I spent way too much time bent over and my back's letting me know it today.  Got it together in about an hour and works like a dream.  But, I put the wheels too high and it doesn't cut the grass low enough. So now I have to wait 'till it's empty so I can tip it over and lower the wheels.  Now I just need to get my weedeater going.    THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE   Okay, I know this should be on my Favorites Blog but I wanted to post it here.  I went out and bought this DVD yesterday and watched it last night.  And all I can say is, Holy Shit.  This movie is awesome.  It's just as good as the original, and that's saying something.  The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the scariest damn movies of all time.  This new one will blow you away.  But it's not a remake.  I think it takes place right after '73 film.  I kind of go lost there.  It's just as surreal as the first.  Remember the dinner scene where the family has that girl tied up and their in all their insane glory?  There's a few scenes in the new one that's like that.  I got worn out just watching this movie.  It physically drained me watching these people go through what they did.  It's shot masterfully.  I have to say that Leatherface it better in this one, a hell of a lot scarier.  I won't give too much away, but there's one scene were he's wearing the face of the girls boyfriend while trying to kill her.  Damn.  And I have to give the love to my man, R. Lee Ermey.  He plays the psycho sheriff to a tee.  Rent or buy this, it's worth it.  I wanted the deluxe double disk, but they didn't have it so I had to settle for the single disk.

       GREAT CARTOON   Just watching Fox News Watch and they had a cartoon on there that I thought was funny as hell.  So I found it.  I couldn't post it here because it's too big and I can't resize it to a size that looks good, so I just posted the link.  The thing about this cartoon is that's driving Dems ape shit.  It's a slam on 'Ol Sour Puss.  It's kind of funny if you think about it.  With all the cartoons, website, tv shows and the like that make fun of Bush to no end, they say nothing.  But a cartoon that slam Kerry, and they fly into a frenzy.  Kind of sad.  Anyway, enjoy the   urlLink cartoon  .    WHA HAPPEN   If you've seen "A Mighty Wind", then you'll know what that title is.  Anyway, it seems that Spains willingness to capitulate to the terrorist was all for naught.  Damn, capitulate.  That's, like, a big word.  Cool.  But back on topic.  Today, while police were raiding an apartment which they believed held three men who helped in the March 11 terrorist attack, one officer was killed and eleven were wounded when these cowardly pieces of shit set off a bomb.  You know.  You give into these people, and how do they repay you?  They kill you.  Damn backstabbers.  You would think that once the new Socialist PM-elect agreed to pull Spains troops out of Iraq, the terrorists would have left Spain for another country to try and fix their elections.  But I guess that's not the case, is it?   Credit:   urlLink Reuters      DON'T FORGET   To turn your clocks forward tonight.  I hate this.  I hate sunset not happening until around 8 P.M.  I like winter and the sun setting around 5:30.  That's my time of year.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       WHY LIBERAL MEDIA OUTLETS WILL FAIL   I wanted to talk about these new Left-Wing media outlets that are starting to pop up.  Al Gore's already   urlLink failed   cable news channel and the liberal Air America Radio and why they're going to fail.  The number one reason?  Two words, "no market".  If people want liberal radio, they turned to NPR.  If they want liberal television, they turned to CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS or countless other channels.  They think they can counteract FoxNews's success by coping their format and filling it with spin.  Or Rush's and Sean Hannity's success on the radio.  They don't understand that people don't want that.  That jackass Al Franken and his "O'Franken Factor".  It's laughable.  Al Franken is a mentally unstable man who can't deal with the fact that Bill O'Reilly will trounce him every time.  So he goes off and becomes the "flagship" show of Air America Radio thinking people will turn off "The Radio Factor" and turn on his lie-spewing, spin-filled, vindictive show.  It ain't going to happen.  They can't figure out why Conservative radio and news channels have become so popular.    I'll tell you why.  We Republicans had to put with the bashing, the lies, down talking, not giving us a voice Big Media for too long.  We fought back, and won.  There was a huge demand for the Voice of Reasoning, and the ratings prove it.  Franken and Garofalo think there's a huge market for their extreme, far left, hate filled rhetoric.  While that may be true in places like San Francisco and Seattle, that's not the case in middle America.  Al Gore's cable news network seems to have already failed before it got off the ground.  I give Air America Radio until maybe August or September before it goes Off-Air.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       ALL THE NEWS THAT'S FIT NOT TO PRINT   You gotta love the NY Times.  We've all heard about the 308,000 jobs that were created last month.  Well it seems that the NY Slimes is willing to only report that part.  They're refusing to report the 759,000 jobs have been created since August.  Why would they leave out that almost 1 million jobs have been created in seven months?

       I'M NOT READY TO GO YET   It seems that Richard Clarke's clock is reading 14:45.  He's calling for a boycott of FoxNews.  It seems that the former terrorism czar that failed this country is upset about Fox finding and getting permission to release his 2002 background briefing where he contradicted the claims he's making today.  Clarke's trying to make his last 15 seconds count as much as he can.   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       NO TITLE   No title for this post, because I couldn't think of one.  Anyway, has anyone else noticed that this Memorial Day has been talked about more than any other Memorial Day in recent years?  I'm sure the WWII Memorial ceremony had some to do with it, but I think   urlLink Drumwaster   hit the reason right on the head.     "Memorial Day has taken a different tone these past two years. No longer is it just remembering past generations and their bravery. Now, the current generation of soldier is proving Americans do have what it takes."     With all the things have happened over the past few years, our soldiers have stood up and shown what they can do when the pressure's on.  So, for the final time this Memorial Day I want the thank the men and women of the U.S. military.  It's because of you and all that you do, or have done, that we're able to enjoy the lives we live.  You help make this country the greatest on Earth.  Thank You.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       AWESOME POST   Take a look at   urlLink this  .  I think nothing more need be said.     I MISSED IT   I had just sat down to lunch and turned on Fox News and I caught the last line of a story Greg Palkot was talking about.  It was something about John Kerry was giving a speech to honor Americas veterans, and someone came up to him and asked him if he was talking about the same Vets that he spat on after the Vietnam War.  Does anyone know anything else about this story?  And this brings up a good point.  Does Kerry really have any room to be talking about honoring our military.  I mean, he did call them criminals and try everything in his power to subvert them.  Unlike Bush, I don't think Kerry really does care as much about our soldiers as he would like us to believe.  And I think they can see right through him and his false praise.  Just look at the polls.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       MEMORIAL DAY THANK YOU        It's a day early, but under the circumstances I don't think it matters.  Today is Memorial Day.  So while you do whatever it is you do today to celebrate, please remember why we have this day.  Fly your flags with pride today and give thanks to the brave men and woman who make possible everything we have.  This post is dedicated to the men and woman who have served and are serving in the United States military.  I've never been in the armed forces, so I don't even pretend to know everything you go through or the sacrifices you have made or are making.  But I just wanted to let you know that you have people back home who love, support and respect you and who wish you a safe and speedy return. You sacrifice everything in your lives for people you don't even know.  You may not call yourselves heroes, but that's what you are.         The first of every month, or in this case Memorial Day, I'll post this message.  This is something that would be great to see take off.  It would be nice to see people honor and thank the men and woman who keep us safe.  What's great about this is that both Democrats and Republicans can participate.  If you would like to take part in this, just copy the bug above and save to your host site.  If you don't have one,   urlLink Photobucket   has a great free host site.  Show your support for the men and woman who defend our freedoms.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       LOOK UP IN THE SKY...   It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Air America going down in flames.  The following is from Drudge.     "FLASH: Al Franken has agreed not to draw a salary at AIR AMERICA, hoping to keep the fledgling talk-radio network afloat... Developing..."    That's all it says.  There's no story to link to yet.  But this is funny.  It wasn't too long ago that people were saying that Air America wasn't dead and that it wasn't going to die.  It's dying a slow and horrible death.  They need to just pull the plug and let it go to that great failed idea bin in the sky.  I said I'd give it until just after Christmas before it died, then I pulled a John Kerry and said it wouldn't make it past Summer.  Well, it looks like it may not even  make  it to Summer.  Al Gore, are you paying attention?    MORE PROOF...   That veterans support Bush and not   urlLink candidate waffles  .  In a recent CBS poll, hardly a Right-Wing poll, Vets support Bush 54 to 41 over Kerry.  Dems AWOL charge appears to have backfired on Kerry.  They know who would do a better job protecting this country.  Just another in a long list of reasons why I hold our brave men and women on such a high plane.  The article also quotes a Bush-Cheney spokesman.    "It's buried in every poll that I've seen"    Now, why do you suppose that is?   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax

       I LOVE THIS STORY   I was listening to The Radio Factor this morning, and Bill was talking about the movie  The Day After Tomorrow .  I learned that the movie based on the book  The Coming Global Superstorm  which was written by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber.  Here's where the story gets good.  Whitley Strieber claims to have been abducted by aliens in 1985.  No joke.  Whitley claims that little  blue  men came to Earth on Dec. 26, 1985 and abducted him.  This is priceless.  This also may explain Al Gore's insane rant about the movie.  One question though, how come Big Media isn't talking about this?  Every time a big movie's made based on a book, every reporter and his mother talks about the book it was based on.  Could it be because this movie blames Bush for the false theory of global warming, and that talking about one of the authors of the book's looney claim of alien abduction could make some people not go see it and blame Bush as well?  Could be.  I found an   urlLink interview   Strieber did in 1997 in which he talks about aliens and abductions.  You should read it.

       THE GREATEST GENERATION        Finally, after way too many years, the men and woman of this country who fought in WWII will be honored with the WWII Memorial.  With WWII soldiers dying at a rate of about 1,056 a day, this should have come a long, long time ago. Both Bush and Kerry used their weekly radio addresses to talk about the sacrifices these men and women made for their country and people they didn't even know.   Bush said this about these brave men and women:    "The memorial will stand forever as a tribute to the generation that fought that war, and to the more than 400,000 Americans who gave their lives. Because of their sacrifice, tyrants fell, fascism and Nazism were vanquished and freedom prevailed."    John Kerry had this to say about President Bush:    "We must rebuild alliances that have been shredded, because an America respected in the world will be an America stronger in the world, and safer here at home."    Leave it to   urlLink candidate waffles   to slam the president on what is supposed to be about honoring the men and women of WWII.  Anyway, I'm not sure if I have readers who fought during the war, but if one happens to pop by, Thank You for your sacrifices and Thank You for helping to make this country what it is today.

       NEW "ARTWORK"        Thanks to my friends over at the VR-WC, I was able to obtain a preliminary copy of the VHS/DVD jacket for Michael Moore's upcoming film  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  I mean, the poster for the movie isn't even out yet, but I guess Moore's so excited about this film that he's getting ahead of himself.  It appears that the movie may come with a convenient tube to aid in the filling yourself with the lies the movie contains.  And just like Moore to try and stick you where the sun don't shine.

       MOORE'S AT IT AGAIN   Michael Moore's a piece of shit.  Plain and simple.  He's now claiming that he has a 20 minute interview with Nick Berg.  Moore says he did the interview last year here in America before Berg made his first trip to Iraq.  Even Berg's sister's questioning this.  Moore's claimed to have sent a copy of the interview to Berg's parents, but there's no way to confirm it because they've been away.  He's also refusing to release it to the media.  The article wonders why Moore would be interested in a complete unknown young wannabe contractor like Berg.  Why would Moore interview a guy who's family insists was pro-Bush and supported the War in Iraq for his anti-Bush film?  That's also my question.  We saw Moore take advantage of and exploit people for his  Bowling For Columbine  mockumentry, and I think he's up to it again.  Even if he does, why would he even say he has an interview with Berg?  You know, just let the family know.  You don't have to release this info to the media.  But that's what Moore does.  He's using this to keep his name out there until  Fahrenheit 9/11 's released.  Knowing how Moore works, I'm not going to believe this until the Berg family says something to confirm it.

       PROOF?   I don't have much time right now, or I'd make a proper post.  But the WSJ says they've seen files that link Saddam to 9/11.  Click the link below to read the story.  But the gist of it is that some members of Saddam's Fedayeen were in Malaysia, along with the 9/11 terrorist, during the time the 9/11 attacks were being planned.  It goes into more detail in the article.  All I have to say about this is, "Cover up".  Big Media won't say a damn thing about this.  They've already tried to cover up the existence of WMD's, if they report proof of a Saddam/9-11 link there goes their argument that Bush lied.  And they can't have that.  But it seems that Bush may have been right the whole time.  He has more speeches coming up about Iraq.  He needs to take one of those speeches and talk about the sarin filled bomb and this report.

       HELL HAS FROZEN OVER     urlLink Candidate waffles   announced today that he  will  accept the nomination in July instead of waiting until August.  He called it a "bold move".  A bold move?  That's why this guy's so laughable.  A bold move is what he did in Vietnam when he saved the life of a fellow soldier.  Accepting the presidential nomination isn't.  You don't suppose this has anything to do with all the pressure Kerry was receiving from his own party do you?    WARMS YOUR HEART   Watching a local newscast tonight, and they were doing a story on some of the good things coming out of the War on Terror.  I know, I know.  Shocking that good things are happening isn't it.  Anyway, they were showing footage of the Oklahoma 45th Infantry of the National Guard.  The troops were handing out food and toys to the Afghan children.  Here's the heart warming part.  One soldier was sitting with a child who couldn't have been more than 6 or 7 years old.  She had a container of bubbles.  As she was blowing the bubbles for this little boy, you should have seen his face light up.  It was like he had never seen anything that amazing in his life.  Another little boy, who was playing with a doll, looked like he was having the time of his life.  These kids have known nothing but war and terror their whole lives.  And to see their faces when they were eating chocolate and playing with bubbles, that alone makes the entire war worth it.  People are trying to make it seem that the soldiers who have lost their lives fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq have died for nothing.  Maybe they should shut their mouths and open their eyes.  They might like what they see.    Click the link below.  They have a video you can watch.  I can't get it to work, but you may have some luck.

       FINALLY   Terry Nichols has finally been convicted of the murder of 161 people in the OKC bombing in 1995.  10 years to finally get justice.  Nichols was already serving live in prison for the murder of eight law enforcement officers.  But with this conviction he could get the death penalty.  Sentencing is scheduled for Tuesday.  I'd be surprised if he doesn't get death.  Then he can join his buddy Timothy McVeigh in hell.

       FIXED   Okay, I got DeoDuce's link fixed.  Now you can just click on it to go her blog.  Enjoy.    JOHN KERRY ON THE WRONG SIDE AGAIN     urlLink Candidate waffles   has been going around lately spouting off about how Bush is to blame for the price of gas in this country.  But for some reason he forgets to mention the fact that newly industrialized countries are in higher demand for oil and in turn that's the cause of high gas.  Not Bush's Middle East policy.  Anyway, according to a new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll only 5% of Americans blame Bush for the price of gas.      "One in five people blamed corporate greed for the high cost of gas, and one in five blamed the war in Iraq. Only 5% blamed President Bush, suggesting he has escaped political damage so far."    I guess these people haven't' gotten the facts either.  Gee, how could that happen?  Big Media's reporting the truth, aren't they?  I also find it funny how Kerry can criticize anyone about this.  If   urlLink candidate waffles   had his way, we'd all be paying 50 cents more right now.  Let's see.  Gas here in the great state of Oklahoma is $1.96 on average.  If Kerry had his way, we'd be paying $2.46.  Just add that .50 to your price and then you can have yet another reason to despise Kerry.   I actually wanted higher gas prices before I wanted lower prices.    Credit:   urlLink USA Today      WICTORY WEDNESDAY   It's that time again.  Wictory Wednesday.

If I'm wrong, I'm sorry DeoDuce.  But if I'm right, then just like this poor, mixed race Republican, or an honest Democrat, we may have a rarity in our little blogosphere.  He supports Israel.

       KIND OF MAKES YOU WONDER   I would have posted this yesterday, but Blogger wouldn't let me in for some reason.  And that's not the first time it's done that.  Anyway, back to the post.  Did anyone else wonder why the networks didn't cover Bush's speech last night?  We've all heard their reason.  "We weren't asked to set aside programming to air it".  But you want to know the real reason why?  Because they were afraid that Bush would talk about the good things happening in the War on Terror and they just couldn't have that.  No way in hell ABC, NBC or CBS would dare want that on their networks.    A POSSIBLE FUTURE FLIP-FLOP?    I turned down the nomination before I accepted it.     urlLink Candidate waffles   is thinking about not accepting the Democratic nomination at their Nominating Committee.  Instead he would wait so he can collect more money for his campaign.  I have no problem with this on it's surface.  Let him collect all the money he wants, as long as he doesn't do it illegally.  And this isn't illegal.  But this does lend more fuel to the flip-flopping waffler argument.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS   A post by   urlLink Troy   over at Starktruth.com gave me the idea for this post.  Troy's post is about a man in Alabama who was fired for wearing a 10 Commandments lapel pin.  And Troy asks    "what if he was Muslim and wore a pin that had a Koran on it? Or a female with a Muslim head scarf? What then? What if it was not religious, what if it was a pro-abortion pin? I bet the ACLU would be there and there would be "outrage" over this deal. What if it was a "black power" pin? The NAACP would be there and Jesse Jackas....Jackson would be on the next flight out."    I can sort of answer that question.  Here in the great state of Oklahoma, a 12-year-old Muslim girl has been allowed to wear her head scarf to school by the Justice Department.  Now, admittedly, I don't know much about Islam, but isn't the head scarf, or hijab, as symbol of their religion?  What happened to "The Separation Of Church And State" the ACLU and Left-Wingers love to throw around?  Does it only apply to Christians?  That's the way it seems.  All my long time readers know I'm not a religious person, but even I can see the persecution of Christians going on in the world today.  They're being told that everything thing they believe in is wrong, evil and hateful.  This little girl is allowed to wear her head scarf to a Government financed school, but if a kid were to wear a Cross to school, in full view of other kids, the ACLU would slap that school district with a massive lawsuit.  You can't have it both ways.  The law isn't John Kerry.  You can't grant one religion special favors while turning down others.  Either let this child wear her head scarf while letting other children represent their religion, or turn them all down.  This could also be said for allowing Menorahs during Chanukkah but not allowing Crosses during Christmas.  The ACLU, along with parents, are so paranoid about their children seeing symbols of religion and how they may corrupt their young minds, but how about letting the children decide if it's hurting them.  I'll guarantee that they could care less.  Speaking as someone who doesn't follow a religion, I don't have a problem with their symbols.  I'm not offended in the least by a Government building displaying a Cross, Menorah, Star of David or anything else they want.  Just don't favor one over the other.

       THE MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY, MANY FLIP-FLOPS OF JOHN KERRY   I got a comment from someone calling himself   urlLink diogenes   in the   urlLink CANDIDATE WAFFLES   post.  He asked me if I've ever done research on Kerry's waffles or if I've blindly accepted them.  Well, there's not much research you have to do to know the real John Kerry.

John Kerry, Remarks At Town Hall Meeting, Manchester, NH, 8/6/03)   Now, Kerry Attacks Patriot Act . We are a nation of laws and liberties, not of a knock in the night.

One such matter is the proposed Constitutional amendment that would prohibit or seriously inhibit any legal recognition whatsoever of same-sex relationships. We believe it would be a grave error for Massachusetts to enshrine in our Constitution a provision which would have such a negative effect on so many of our fellow residents.  We are therefore united in urging you to reject this Constitutional amendment and avoid stigmatizing so many of our fellow citizens who do not deserve to be treated in such a manner. (Sen.

If America is at war, I wont speak a word without measuring how itll sound to the guys doing the fighting when theyre listening to their radios in the desert. (Glen Johnson, Democrats On The Stump Plot Their War Rhetoric, The Boston Globe, 3/11/03)   But Weeks Later, With Troops Just Miles From Baghdad, Kerry Broke His Pledge . What we need now is not just a regime change in Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States, Kerry said in a speech at the Peterborough Town Library. Despite pledging two weeks ago to cool his criticism of the administration once war began, Kerry unleashed a barrage of criticism as US troops fought within 25 miles of Baghdad. (Glen Johnson, Kerry Says Us Needs Its Own Regime Change, The Boston Globe, 4/3/03)     Flip-Flopped On Death Penalty For Terrorists     In 1996, Kerry Attacked Governor Bill Weld For Supporting Death Penalty For Terrorists .

And it is divisive because it creates a perception and a reality of reverse discrimination that has actually engendered racism. (Lynne Duke, Senators Seek Serious Dialogue On Race, The Washington Post, 4/8/92)   In 2004, Kerry Denied Ever Having Called Affirmative Action Divisive.  CNNs KELLY WALLACE: We caught up with the Senator, who said he never called affirmative action divisive, and accused Clark of playing politics. SEN. KERRY: Thats not what I said. I said there are people who believe that. And I said mend it, dont end it. Hes trying to change what I said, but you can go read the quote. I said very clearly I have always voted for it. Ive always supported it. Ive never, ever condemned it. I did what Jim Clyburn did and what Bill Clinton did, which is mend it. And Jim Clyburn wouldnt be supporting it if it were otherwise. So lets not have any politics here.

I dont know. Mr. Kerry did say his personal disposition is open to the issue of medical marijuana and that hed stop Drug Enforcement Administration raids on patients using the stuff under Californias medical marijuana law. (Jennifer Harper, Inside Politics, The Washington Times, 8/8/03)   But Now Kerry Says He Wants To Wait For Study Analyzing Issue Before Making Final Decision . The Massachusetts Democrat said Wednesday hed put off any final decision on medical marijuana because theres a study under way analyzing what the science is. (Jennifer Harper, Inside Politics, The Washington Times, 8/8/03)     Flip-Flopped On Burma Sanctions     In 1995, Kerry Was Against Burma Sanctions.  I question whether isolation is a successful means of promoting political change, Kerry told a constituent in a 1995 letter justifying his opposition to a Burma sanction bill. (Geeta Anand, et al., Menino Gets Ahead Of Himself, Starts Contemplating Third Term, The Boston Globe, 5/18/97)   But Now Kerry Supports Burma Sanctions.  In his 1996 reelection campaign, Kerry, after Governor William F. Weld took up the cause, was badgered by advisers into shifting his position. But as he eyes a presidential campaign and the Burma sanction movement gains credibility, Kerry  describes the Burma regime as a semi-criminalized dictatorship  which should not be treated with respect by other nations, but should be instead subject to limitations on travel, investment, and access to the most developed nations. (Geeta Anand, et al., Menino Gets Ahead Of Himself, Starts Contemplating Third Term, The Boston Globe, 5/18/97)     Flip-Flopped On Military Experience As Credential For Public Office     Kerry: Service Should Not Be Litmus Test For Leadership . Mr. President, you and I know that if support or opposition to the war were to become a litmus test for leadership, America would never have leaders or recover from the divisions created by that war. You and I know that if service or nonservice in the war is to become a test of qualification for high office, you would not have a Vice President, nor would you have a Secretary of Defense and our Nation would never recover from the divisions created by that war. (Sen. John Kerry, Congressional Record, 10/08/92, p. S17709)   But Now Kerry Constantly Challenges The Stature Of His Democratic Opponents Over Their Lack Of Military Service . And more than ever, Mr. Kerry is invoking his stature as a Vietnam veteran as he challenges the stature of his Democratic opponents -- none of whom, he frequently points out, have worn the uniform of our country -- to withstand a debate with Mr. Bush on national security. (Adam Nagourney, As Campaign Tightens, Kerry Sharpens Message, The New York Times, 8/10/03)     Flip-Flopped On PACs     Kerry Used To Decry Special Interests And Their PAC Money.  Im frequently told by cynics in Washington that refusing PAC money is naive, Kerry told his supporters in 1985. Do you agree that it is naïve to turn down special interests and their PAC money? (Glen Johnson, In A Switch, Kerry Is Launching A PAC, The Boston Globe, 12/15/01)   But Now, Kerry Has Established His Own PAC . A week after repeating that he has refused to accept donations from political action committees, Senator John F. Kerry announced yesterday that he was forming a committee that would accept PAC money for him to distribute to other Democratic candidates.  Kerrys stance on soft money, unregulated donations funneled through political parties, puts him in the position of raising the type of money that he, McCain, and others in the campaign-finance reform movement are trying to eliminate. (Glen Johnson, In A Switch, Kerry Is Launching A PAC, The Boston Globe, 12/15/01)     Flip-Flopped On $10,000 Donation Limit To His PAC     When Kerry Established His PAC In 2001, He Instituted A $10,000 Limit On Donations . A week after repeating that he has refused to accept donations from political action committees, Senator John F. Kerry announced yesterday that he was forming a committee that would accept PAC money for him to distribute to other Democratic candidates  The statement also declared that the new PAC would voluntarily limit donations of so-called soft money to $10,000 per donor per year and disclose the source and amount of all such donations. (Glen Johnson, In A Switch, Kerry Is Launching A Pac, The Boston Globe, 12/15/01)   One Year Later, Kerry Started Accepting Unlimited Contributions . Senator John F. Kerry, who broke with personal precedent last year when he established his first political action committee, has changed his fund-raising guidelines again, dropping a $10,000 limit on contributions from individuals, a cap he had touted when establishing the PAC. The Massachusetts Democrat said yesterday he decided to accept unlimited contributions, which has already allowed him to take in soft money donations as large as $25,000, because of the unprecedented fund-raising demands confronting him as a leader in the Senate Democratic caucus. (Glen Johnson, Kerry Shifts Fund-Raising Credo For His Own PAC, The Boston Globe, 10/4/02)     Flip-Flopped On Using Personal Funds In 1996 Race     In 1996, Kerry And Weld Established $500,000 Limit Of Personal Wealth To Be Used In Senate Campaign . In 1996, Kerry and Weld gave their already noteworthy Senate race added significance by establishing a spending cap. The candidates agreed to spend no more than $6.9 million from July 1 through the election. Weld ended up spending $6.6 million and Kerry $6.3 million. One key element of the agreement limited the candidates to spending $500,000 in personal wealth, a clause Weld favored because Kerry is married to a millionaire, Teresa Heinz. (Glen Johnson, In Kerrys Plan For A Pac, The Resolution Of Opposites, The Boston Globe, 12/18/01)   Kerry Broke Agreement By Spending $1.2 Million Over Limit . [P]ost-election reports showed a last-minute infusion of $1.7 million from Kerrys wife, heiress Teresa Heinz.  [K]erry denied that his campaign violated its agreement. The money had been loaned--not contributed--by his wife, he explained. There was nothing in the agreement that restricted us from taking a loan  and we paid it back in $1,000 and $2,000 chunks. (Global Ecology Lobby Rocked By Defection, Political Finance, The Newsletter, 1/02)    Flip-Flopped On Israel Security Fence    October 2003: Kerry Calls Fence Barrier To Peace.  And I know how disheartened Palestinians are by the Israeli governments decision to build a barrier off the green line, cutting deeply into Palestinian areas.

Its a serious challenge, and it is a war of sorts, but it is not the kind of war theyre trying to market to America. Kerry characterized the war on terror as predominantly an intelligence-gathering and law enforcement operation. Its basically a manhunt, he said. You gotta know who they are, where they are, what theyre planning, and you gotta be able to go get em before they get us. (Katherine M.

       WHOA        Talk about being lucky.  And about Kerry's comment about his training wheels falling off.  Does   urlLink candidate waffles   have any room to talk?  At least Bush didn't get up, cry and blame a Secret Service agent for his fall.  He just back on his bike and rode 16 miles back home.  I haven't heard any reports about what Kerry did after his fall, but I'm willing to bet he called an ambulance.

       HATE WINS AGAIN   Did I   urlLink call it   or what?  Cannes has awarded Moore the Golden Palm for his latest lie filled toilet paper of a film.  Does this come as a shock to anyone?  The hate mongering French awarded the hate monger Moore their top award.  Not that big of a surprise.  I love how Quentin Tarantino, one of the judges, said that the award wasn't political.  I'm sure Tarantino, as well as the other judges, are big Bush supporters.  Moore also apologize to the frogs for Americans calling them "Cheese-eating surrender monkeys" for not helping in the war on terror.  Well, he didn't apologize for me.

       ALTERNATIVE FUELS   I wanted to talk about this subject quickly.  I keep hearing that we need to lessen our dependency on foreign oil.  I couldn't agree more.  Drill Alaska. It may only last us 10 years or so, but that 10 year without having to depend on Arab countries.  Then when those 10 years are up, find a different source.  But the number one solution I keep hearing about is hybrid cars.  Hydrogen, electric or whatever else Ed Begly, Jr. can forcefeed us.  What about us cavemen that don't want to drive a wimpy electric car.  Have you seen these things.  I'm a big man, I can't fit my ass in one of those toy cars.  Plus, when I start a car, I want to know it's running.  I want to hear the motor come alive.  I want to step on the gas and let the neighborhood know I'm there.  The cliche, I want to hear that baby purr.  I don't want some namby pamby, save the ozone, get 100 miles per gallon, wuss-mobile.  I want a good 'ol American made pollution-mobile.  Hell, I won't be around when the ozone layer disappears in 1,000 years.  What do I care.  The Hummer or the 1970 Boss Mustang, those are my dream cars.  Like a great man once said, "More Power, Ar, Ar, Ar".     I FINALLY WON SOMETHING   In all my years on this Earth, I've never won anything.  Until now.  I won a caption contest over at Stark Truth.  Check out my   urlLink prize  .  Oh, if only it were true.  What I wouldn't give to meet Kathy Ireland and take her for a ride in my '70 Boss Mustang.  But dreams are what keep us going I guess.

       BROTHER, COULD YOU SPARE A LISTENER?   Air America is in more trouble.  It seem the Unfair & really Unbalanced radio network is begging everyone they can get for 8 million dollars.  They've even got "Bubba", his wife, and madman George Soros in on the fundraising.    "This venture is not dead and it's not going to die,"    Said one backer of the network.  But I'm afraid it's damn close.  I gave it until Christmas before it went under.  It looks like it may not even make it past Summer.  I hope Al Gore's watching all this.  The Dems are so desperate to take this country back from it's Conservative turn that they're ignoring the fact that people don't want the Left-wing lies of the 90's right now.  They want the upbeat, "I'm proud to be an American once again" shift Bush has brought.  As I've stated before, it's a cycle.  During the 80's, this country swung Conservative.  During the 90's, Liberal.  Now we're back in the Conservative swing.  One day the Liberal swing will rear it's ugly head again.  They just need to calm down and wait.

       SOMETHING COOL   I made a post like this once on a message board,   urlLink Jake   may remember it, and I thought I would do it here as well.  Anyway, I just came in from taking the garbage out and while I was out there I happened to look up to the sky.  Clear night, and again it hit me just how big this world really is.  If you've never done it before, everyone of you should go out one clear night and just look at the sky.  Follow the curve of it.  Look at the stars.  It's amazing.  It really puts into perspective just how tiny we humans are.  If you're able to, lay on the ground and watch the night sky.  Not only is it an awesome site to see, it's also very calming.  Try to find the constellations.  Really take in the size.  With all the things going on in the world today, you begin to realize that we really do have it pretty good.  We were lucky enough to be given this planet.  But for some reason we don't take the time to look at everything it has to offer.  Some of you may be able to do this, I don't know where everyone lives, but one time I would love to go to the middle of nowhere, no noise, no lights, nothing but complete silence and just sit and think.  Complete isolation.  You know, it's nice to get away from the political rigmarole every once and awhile and do a post like this.

       I'M FLABBERGASTED   Watching FoxNews earlier, and were interviewing someone about   urlLink 'Ol Sourpuss   and in their little Fox Facts thing at the bottom of the screen they had a fact that I found rather amusing.  Who do you think is the biggest contributor to the Kerry Campaign?  His Band of Brothers?  Everyday average Dems?  His wife?  No.  It lawyers.  Can't say as I'm shocked by that.  The people who sue at the drop of a hat support Kerry more than anyone else.  Huh.  And how much do you want to bet that over 90% of those lawyers who contribute to Kerry are defense lawyers?  Also on that Fox Fact, guess who's Bush's biggest contributors are.  Enron?  The Nazi Party?  The richest 1% of Americans?  No.  It's retires.  You know, the old people Bush is supposed to be screwing over and kicking out on the street.  He's taking all their Social Security money, but somehow they still manage to contribute to his campaign.  That's interesting.

And in small chance there's a lull between waffles, I'll rehash some of his classics.  Today's waffle is one of his latest one.

       ANOTHER BIG MEDIA COVERUP   I just became aware of this story because of   urlLink Claudia  .     "Four people have been arrested over the beheading of US businessman Nicholas Berg, whose killing was shown earlier this month in a video on an Al-Qaeda linked website, a senior Iraqi source said.  Asked if more than one person had been arrested in connection with the killing, the source told AFP: "Yes, four people."  Unfortunately Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi was not among those arrested."    They forgot to report this but they made sure we all knew about Jeremy Sivits' conviction.  I tell you, it's a sad day for news when we can't rely on the big "news" outlets for our news.  We're left up to our own devices for stories.  Thank goodness for blogs like ours or we'd never know the truth.

       PRISON FOR ABUSER   Spc. Jeremy C. Sivits has been given a year in prison for his roll in the abuse of Iraqi prisoners.  Which, in my opinion, is more than fair.  Prisoners or not, we can't go around punching, kicking, stomping on their hands and feet and degrading people like that.  If it had been Iraqi military doing this to American soldiers, and pictures surfaced of it, I think more people in America would a hell of a lot more pissed off and wouldn't be saying "They were just letting off a little steam".  It's wrong no matter how you look at it.  Spc. Sivits pleaded guilty to three counts of abuse will also face a reduction in rank and a bad conduct discharge.  He will also give details about the rolls of the other soldiers who were involved in the abuse.   Credit:   urlLink AP & My Way News        WICTORY WEDNESDAY   It's that time again.

       WELL DUH   As you all know, Michael Moore showed his new toilet paper of a movie to the Cannes audience.  Well, it seems that after the movie was shown it got a 15 minute standing ovation.  I'm shocked.  A movie who's subtitle should be "I Hate George W. Bush And I Got The Lies To Prove It" got a standing ovation from other Bush hating American actors and the French.  I mean, is this supposed to impress people?  You know Moore's going to squeeze every bit of publicity out of this he can.

       JUST A QUICK THOUGHT     "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character." -Martin Luther King  August 28, 1963     Doesn't Affirmative Action do the exact opposite of that?    KERRY'S BAND OF BROTHERS TURNS ON HIM   Well, that's not exactly true.  They would have had to be on his side to begin with to turn on him.  We all know the picture   urlLink 'Ol Sourpuss   likes to show of him on his swift boat in his uniform with his "Band Of Brothers".  Well, eleven of those men have demanded that Kerry stop making them look like supporters by parading that picture around.      "Many of us don't want to be included in that picture because we have a rather unsavory feeling about this fellow"    boatmate Bob Elder told radio host Linda Chavez.      "We regard the fact that he rallied the American public against his fellow comrades in arms as basically a betrayal of all of us."    Kerry betrayed his Band Of Brothers.  We all knew that.  But Big Media won't heavily report this story.  They want to try and cover this up along with Nick Berg and the Sarin bomb in Iraq.

       REVIEW OF FAHRENHEIT 9/11   Netscape News has a review of Michael moor's new lie filled enema bag called Fahrenheit 9/11.  Here's a sample of the report.    "Where "Roger & Me" and "Bowling for Columbine" were personal quests for truth, looking at a subject from different angles and talking to people polls apart in their points of view, Moore stays "on message" here from first shot to last. There is no debate, no analysis of facts or search for historical context. Moore simply wants to blame one man and his family for the situation in Iraq the United States now finds itself in."    Okay, when did Moore ever search for historical context or let facts get in his way of making his movies?     "The movie begins with the contested 2000 presidential election. Moore takes the usual anti-Bush view that the election was stolen. Moore then characterizes Bush as a country bumpkin in the initial months of his presidency, spending 42% of his time on vacation and falling rapidly in public opinion polls."    Same old Liberal talking points.  "Bush stole the election".  Never mind the fact that  EVERY  recount done in Florida has Bush winning.  And "country bumpkin".  That sound like moor's trying to label all us rednecks as slow witted and dumb.  I'm proud to be a bumpkin from the country.  I take pride in it.    "Then comes 9/11. Moore touchingly conveys this day of infamy with a montage of sounds and visuals that refrains from showing images of airplanes hitting buildings or the World Trade Center collapsing. Instead, we get noise of horror over a blank screen, then shots of crying, horrified people staring into a sky filling with smoke and debris."    Okay, that surprised me.  Knowing the kind of ass Moore is, I figured he would be showing the planes slam into the buildings with a picture of Bush laughing the whole time.  Moore may actually have a human being living somewhere inside.  He should let it out more.    "Even if one agrees with all of Moore's arguments, the film reduces decades of American foreign-policy failures to a black-and-white cartoon that lays the blame on one family. He ignores facts like the policy to arm and support Afghan rebels that began in the Carter administration. For that matter, the Clinton team never mounted a serious effort to go after al-Qaida even after the 1998 embassy bombings in East Africa."    Yeah, everything wrong with the world is Bush's fault.  Even before his father was president, he failed to do the right thing.  And you can't expect Moore to fault "Bubba".  Clinton was a God among the Left.  Clinton can do no wrong.    "The movie contains only one episode of Moore's patented "ambushes" of the famous. He collars congressmen leaving Capitol Hill and tries to persuade them to enlist their children to fight in Iraq. Not surprisingly, he has no takers."    Moore wants congressmen to enlist their children to fight in Iraq.  Why doesn't Moore spend less money on his hourly grocery shopping and give that money to the people he claims to support from his Manhattan digs?  So this isn't even going to be one of his mockumentries.  This is nothing but a, possible two hour, lie filled, fact absent Bush hatefest.  All brought to you by the party of peace, love and understanding.

       NOT CELEBRATE?   My ass.  How dare the Olympic Committee suggest the American and English athletes not run around after one of their many wins and celebrate by wrapping themselves in the stars and stripes or the Union Jack.  "It might offend other countries who may already have strained views of us".  Bullshit.  After our athletes win, they should grab Old Glory or the Jack and shove it in their faces chanting USA, USA, USA or England, England, England.  France isn't being asked not to celebrate.  Germany's not being asked to celebrate.  Canada, Australia or Japan aren't being asked not to celebrate.  Only our two countries.  Can someone say "discrimination" or "jealousy"?  They just don't want to have to listen to our national anthems over and over and over again.  And I'll guarantee you this.  The mass majority of the people in the stadium will boo till their horse when the Star Spangled Banner is played.  Right then our athletes should collectively raise their right arms and flip them off.  Or in England's case, give them the 'ol two finger salute.  But then we'd just be criticized for "unsportsman like conduct".  Oh well.         The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       BREAKING NEWS   I'll just paste the whole article.    "BAGHDAD (Reuters)-The U.S. military said Monday an artillery shell exploded in Iraq had released a small amount of the nerve agent sarin.  It was the first announcement of the discovery of any of the weapons on which Washington made its case for war.  Brigadier Gen. Mark Kimmitt told a news conference that the substance had been found in an artillery shell discovered by a U.S. convoy. The round exploded, causing a small release of the substance, he said."     Could this be the "smoking gun" Bush haters have been bitching about?  This is just being reported so there's not much more info, yet.    Credit:   urlLink Reuters      KERRY'S AN IDIOT   Plain and simple.  Today makes the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education.    urlLink 'Ol Sourpuss   warned that there are forces that sought to "see it undone".  He talked about how the White House "has set back affirmative action and broken its promise of an education policy that leaves no child behind".  So Kerry's trying to scare people into thinking that Bush wants to re-segregate schools.  That Bush wants to hold black people back because he criticizes the racist policy known as affirmative action.  What an ass.

       SYRIA AND NORTH KOREA   A new report out of Japan says that Syrian technicians who were carrying "unkown equipment" were killed in the in the train explosion in North Korea on April 22.  North Korea has confirmed that the technicians were killed in the explosion.  They said that they were accompanying "large equipment" and that the damage from the explosion was greatest in the portion of the train they occupied.  When N. Korean military personnel arrived to the scene, they were wearing protective suits and removed material only from the section the Syrians were sitting in.  The Syrian technicians were from the technical research center called Centre d'Etudes et de Recherche Scientific.  CERS is viewed as player in Syria's WMD program.  Let's see.  We took care of the Taliban, Saddam and Libya all in four years.  So in the next four years, W's going to have to take care of Syria, N. Korea, Iran and Palestine.  That's what's known as a "productive term".   Credit:   urlLink World Tribune      BUSH AND A SECOND TERM   Watching something last night, I can't remember what it was, but it was some Bush bashing actor or musician and it got me thinking about Bush and a second term.  These celebs hate Bush with a passion.  They despise him, and Republicans in general, and would love nothing more than to see him booted out in Novemember.  And I thought, I would love to see Bush win, if for no other reason than to piss these people off.  Could you imagine the collective groan from people like Martin Sheen, Michael Moore, Moby and Janeane Garofalo?  I'd love it.  Listening to them spew their lie filled venom for four more years not understanding why he won a second term.  Priceless.

       HIT IT RIGHT ON THE NOSE     "Why is it that the media can show over and over again pictures that could make Arabs hate Americans, but refuse to show pictures that could make Americans hate Arabs?"     That's from a post over at   urlLink Instapundit  .  Go have a read, it's pretty good.  It's talking about the pictures from Abu Ghraib and the murder of Nick Berg.  I keep hearing about the media trying to forget about the Berg story while harping on the prison abuse, but never really thought about it until two days ago.  I got a copy of the local Liberal media paper here and front page big as life was a story on Abu Ghraib while Nick Berg was on page two.  Of course Big Media wants to hide this story.  It could inflame us hateful, ignorant Americans into violence against innocent Arabs.  But violence by Arabs against innocent Americans is hunky-dory with them.  That's just good news there.

       WHAT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY?        I'm sure they didn't know.  Why would the British press want to knowingly print lies?  I mean they were all for the War On Terror to begin with.  The British press is known for their honesty and integrity, just like the press here in the states.    Okay, enough of that.  The Daily Mirror absolutely will not take personal responsibility for this.  They knew these were fakes, and yet they didn't care.  For all we know the bastards that killed Nick Berg may have been getting their "news" from Britain and not America.  And if that's true, and they're seeing this, then maybe that's what convinced them to kill him.  Who knows.

       THE JOHN KERRY SHOW   Many of you may not know this, but John Kerry is having is campaign turned into a reality show.  The name of the show's going to be "The  Lies  Lifes And  Twists  Times Of John Kerry".  While I haven't been able to get any actual footage of the show yet, I was able, through the VR-WC, to obtain a screenshot of the first episode.  They also would't let me post the audio of this first episode, but I can tell you what he's saying.  Enjoy.         "And in this slide I'm in the Mekong Delta with my band of brothers.  That's in Vietnam.  Where I fought.  During the Vietnam War."    Then someone, I'm guessing someone who didn't know that much about Kerry, stood up and asked him how many awards and medals did he earn in Vietnam.  And Kerry flipped out, screaming    "ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY PATRIOTISM?"    And had this poor guy tossed out.  This sounds like a hit to me.

       PURE SCUM   Two radio DJ's, Marconi and Tiny, were fired from their morning show in Portland, Pennsylvania, I think it's Pennsylvania anyway, for airing the audio of the beheading of Nick Berg while making jokes about it.  One listener said that the DJ known as Marconi was giving the play by play and explained each part of the murder while laughing and joking about it.  After these two fucks were fired Marconi apologized on his Web site, saying    "I say a lot of stupid things on the radio but this is the most inappropriate thing that I have ever done and I am very ashamed of myself for doing it."    What's sad is that these two will more than likely find another station manger who will hire them for the ratings they could bring in.

       WILL HE OR WON'T HE?   With Nick Berg's father all over every news channels blaming Bush for his sons death, how long do you think it'll be before John Kerry brings him on the road with him?  Because that's the kind of man Kerry is.  Opportunistic and doesn't care who he exploits for his political gain.  He said that people shouldn't use the Vietnam War for their political gain, yet he somehow manages to mention it just about everyday.  While I do feel bad for Mr. Berg's loss, blaming Bush and Rumsfeld is just the wrong thing to do.  Nick Berg knew the dangers of going over to Iraq.  No one forced him to go.  My guess is that he didn't like the Bush Administration from the beginning, and he's letting that run his emotions now.  I'm not slamming or attacking Michael Berg, please don't think that.  I'm just telling you what I think.    THE END IS HERE   The end of good sense is over and done with.  Yesterday I was listening to Zeppelin's Rock And Roll and my 13 year old nephew came in and said,     "Hey, that's the Cadillac song.  I didn't know they put that out on CD."    I wanted to roll over and scream.  Led Zeppelin, the greatest band on Earth, has been reduced to only being know by the younger generation by a commercial.  This is a sad day for music.  Damn you Cadillac, damn you to hell.  Why oh way did they have to sell their song to a commercial.  I understand that it may help get their music out to a younger audience, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  I hate when people list their influences in music as AC/DC, Led Zeppelin and Limp Bizkit.  That's wrong.  I don't know, maybe I was just born in the wrong generation.

       A NIGHTMARE ON PENNSYLVANIA AVE.   Only this time it's not Freddy Kruger coming to snatch your kids, it's Ralph Nader coming to snatch some of Kerry's supporters.  John Kerry's worst nightmare has come true.  The Reform Party has endorsed Nader.  What does this mean for Kerry?  Now that he's been endorsed by the Reform Party, his name will now appear on the ballot in at least seven states.  Including Florida and Michigan, which 'Ol Sourpuss has been campaigning in heavily hoping to win.  Those are two key "battleground" states that both Bush and Kerry need to win if they hope to be occupying the White House next year.  Before the endorsement, Nader's name wasn't on any ballot.  Which meant that people who wanted to vote for him had to vote by write in.  Now they don't have to be worried with all that.  All they have to do is check his name.  Unless they live in Florida, in which case they sue over the ballots a few times declaring them racist.  Nader is the only candidate in the race who is against the War On Terror.  What with Kerry becoming Bush Light on the war, there are many Dems who have become disenfranchised with Kerry's flip flop on the war and could very well vote for Nader because of it.  I say let them vote for who they want.  This is a free country.  We have the right to vote our conscience.  And if their conscience is telling them to vote Nader, let them.  That's what's great about this country.  We don't get a gun to the head and told who to vote for.  Of course, I may be a little biased on this.

       IN HIS OWN WORDS   Michael Moore's own words,    "The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not "insurgents" or "terrorists" or "The Enemy." They are the REVOLUTION, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow -  and they will win. "    I wonder if he fells this way about the bastards that killed Nick Berg?  They're not terrorists or the enemy?  If they're not Moore's enemy, are they his friends?  Are they the REVOLUTION?  Does he want really want these people to win?  You better believe he does.

       NEW "ARTWORK"   In an effort to compete with   urlLink Matt Ashby's   work, yeah right, I've created a new masterpiece for you to enjoy.         MAKES ME WANT TO CHANGE PARTIES   Almost.  Well, a bit of bad news for the GOP.  John Ramsey is running for a seat in the Michigan House of Representatives.  As a Republican.  This is sick.  I truly believe he had something to do with his daughters murder.  I know "innocent until proven guilty", but I've already convicted him in my mind.  If he or his wife had nothing to with this little girls murder, and they truly loved and miss her, then why is he opening himself and his family to the scrutiny that will follow them through out the campaign?  Him being a Republican almost makes me what to jump ship to another party.  Almost.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       KERRY FAILS AMERICA, YET AGAIN   Get a load of this story.  There was a vote in the Senate yesterday to extend federal jobless benefits.  An issue Kerry has been stumping on and supporting for some time.  Well, the measure failed by just one vote.  Can you guess which Senator was the only one not to vote?  That's right.  'Ol Sourpuss himself.  It seems that attacking W on this subject is more important that actually doing something about it.  The Bush camp's already come out swinging saying that Kerry's too busy campaigning to do his job.  But wait, Kerry supported the measure.  So theoretically he voted for the extension before he didn't' vote for it.  I wonder how Kerry and the Left are going to spin this into being Bush's fault.  And in a headline within a story,   IS THIS HYPOCRISY?   Right now the unemployment rate in this country is 5.6%.  Now I may be wrong, but that doesn't sound like a huge number to.  At least not the doom and gloom the Left want us to think it is.  Anyway, during the '96 re-election of "Bubba", can you guess what the unemployment rate was?  8%?  3%?  1%?  No, it was 5.6%.  That's right, 5.6%.  The same as it is now.  And back then Dems didn't think it was too bad but now they think it's a tragedy.  Hypocrisy and Double Standards.  Damn, I don't think I've ever blogged this early before.  It's just now 8:00.   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      WICTORY WEDNESDAY   It's that time again.  Wictory Wednesday.

If you're the one from Japan that's visited, thank you and I hope you like the site.  I gotten hits from some other pretty cool place as well.  Canada, Russia, England, Ireland, Iraq and Australia are the ones I can remember.  It's weird when you think about it.

       THIS IS SICK   I'm sure you've all heard about the video out of Iraq that shows American Nick Berg being beheaded by who is believed to be Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a top leader in al Qaeda.  I don't think anyone in this country will show the tape, at least I hope not, but it reportedly shows Berg telling who he is and where he's from.  Then it goes on to show al-Zarqawi, wearing a mask of course, the gutless piece of shit, letting out a scream, cutting Nick Berg's head off the chanting "Allahu akbar", or God Is Great.  Then he holds the head up to the camera.  They said it's in retaliation for the abuse in Abu Ghraib.  Here's my question.  When do you think we'll hear the outrage from the Middle East over this?  Can you say, "Never"?  There's a  HUGE  difference between putting someone in a dog collar and chopping someone's head of for the world to see.  I've said it once before in a post, the time for pussy footing around is over with.  We need to go into these "holy" places where they're held up and burn them to the ground.  Fuck what people think about it and us.  I don't care.  We're too busy being concerned what Muslims think of us that we're letting them run roughtshot over us.  They hit us time and time again.  It's time we hit back.   Credit:   urlLink Yahoo! News      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       TED KENNEDY IS A BIG, FAT MORON   From the Jim Bean breath of Teddy himself,    "On March 19, 2004, President Bush asked, 'Who would prefer that Saddam's torture chambers still be open?'  Shamefully, we now learn that Saddam's torture chambers reopened under new management: U.S. management."    Only a Liberal could compare the rapes and murders by Saddam to what's happening now.  Everyone here knows how I feel about these "soldiers" who did this, but what they did is in no way comparable to what Saddam did.  But of course you have to remember these are the same people who think Bush is worse than Hitler.

       THE NEW LOOK   As you can see, I've changed the look again.  I had too.  I was having too many problems with the 3 column style.  Putting things in other than links was a bitch, but the load time was a nightmare.  The three column blog took over two and a half minutes to load.  This one takes just under two minutes for the whole thing to load, but at least the stuff shows up before then so you can read while you wait.  Also, I got rid of a lot of links.  Just no room.  I only left the blogs and a few other things I couldn't part with.  I will miss the Reagan pic, but life is full of sacrifices.  I might make a few more tweaks here and there, but all in all I like the look.  Let me know what you think and if you have any problems with something.    One last thing, Jeff, I'm calling on your help again.  If you wouldn't mind, could you take a look at the source code and do two things for me.   1.  All the stuff in the right column is  bold .  Could you get rid of that for me? 2.  I have an error.  I think it's in the Mail Me section.  I can't seem to find it.  Could you have a look at it for me.  EDIT  Jeff, if you haven't begun yet, I was wondering if you do just one more thing for me?  In the main body of the blog, where it's surrounded by that blue/grey line.  Could you get rid of that white part after the line?    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       I NEED YOUR HELP   I need some help from those of you with dogs.  I have a dog that, for some reason, just refuses to eat sometimes.  But it's not that he doesn't eat at all, it sporadic.  For maybe two days he'll eat every bit of food I put down as soon as I put it down.  And then he'll go into a pattern of eating nothing for two or three days.  Sometimes he'll just smell it and walk away and other times he won't even bother getting up.  Does anyone have any ways you use to get your dogs to eat.  Forget about getting him a different brand of food, he'll only eat one brand.  I've moved his dish to a different spot.  He's not gotten sick yet, but one day he might.

       WILL THE REAL JOHN KERRY PLEASE STAND UP   What kind of man is John Kerry?  Well, I'll tell you.  Last week he sent his wife out on a talkshow to call President Bush and VP Cheney unpatriotic because she thinks they've criticized his record in Vietnam.  First off, no they haven't.  They've criticized what he's done afterwards.  Anyway, 'Ol Sourpuss did this knowing that the Bush Campaign couldn't do anything in return to her because the wives of candidates are off limits during an election.  This is what Bill O'Reilly's talking about when he says "Hit and Run" tactics.  Sends his wife out to do his dirty work without fear of any real reprisal.  That's who John Kerry really is.  The man has a yellow streak stretching all the way back to 1970.   By the way, I like the new look of blogger.  Looks a lot better.

       HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY   To all the mothers and mothers-to-be, Happy Mother's Day.  I'm only sure of two woman who read my blog,   urlLink Claudia   and   urlLink Jane   and I don't know if either one of them are mothers.  But if there are any mothers who happen upon here have a very happy mother's day.  Here's some things I found on mothers that I thought I would share.  Enjoy.    "God could not be everywhere and therefore he made mothers." -- Jewish proverb  "By and large, mothers and housewives are the only workers who do not have regular time off. They are the great vacationless class." -- Anne Morrow Lindbergh   "All that I am or ever hope to be, I owe to my angel Mother." -- Abraham Lincoln  A picture memory brings to me; I look across the years and see Myself beside my mother's knee. I feel her gentle hand restrain My selfish moods, and know again A child's blind sense of wrong and pain. But wiser now, a man gray grown, My childhood's needs are better known. My mother's chastening love I own. -- John Greenleaf Whittier       The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       HELP ME OUT HERE   When did the rest of the world love and respect us last?  I keep hearing that since Bush came to office, we have never been more feared, hated and disrespect.  Has the Middle East ever loved us?  When was the last time France showed respect for us?  As for fear.  You damn right they better fear us.  Without fear, we become Switzerland.  It's not Bush they hate, they hate our economy.  As bad as it is, it's a hell of a lot better than most of the countries of the world.  They see that we're doing better than they are and they're jealous.  But the number one reason they hate us.  Power.  We have the power that France and Germany think they deserve, and they hate us for it.  They hate the fact that they're not able to tell us what to do.  On a personal note, I don't give a rats ass what other countries think of us.  I could care less if France, Germany, England, Saudi Arabia or Iran love or respect us.    PeTA WANTS TO HELP MOORE   You all know I hate Michael Moore and PeTA.  Well, it seems that PeTA is trying to help Mr. Moore out.  The "animal rights" groups has targeted Moore as one of their "Flab Five" and are treating him to a "Veg Eye for the Fat Guy".  They're going to be sending Moore a kit filled with health and diet tips, their vegetarian starter kit and suggestions on how he can change his lifestyle.  I find this quite amusing, but it gets down to a bigger point.  People trying to tell us how to live our lives.  PeTA goes around telling us not to wear fur or eat meat.  It's my right to eat meat.  I despise people trying to tell me how to live my life.  It's my life, and it's Moore's life.  How dare anyone tell me how to live it.  I, as well has he, has ever right to live it the way we want.  As much as I hate Moore, this is one time I have to stand with him.     The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       RANDOM THOUGHTS 5   Yes, it's time for everyone's favorite post.  Random Thoughts.  In case you're new and don't know, Random Thoughts is a post a do every once and awhile in which I post random thoughts and nonsense.  Just what ever's on my mind.  Let's get started.       Isn't the Bald Eagle not one of the most beautiful animals on the planet?  Why are gold and diamonds considered so valuable?  I mean they're just rocks.  In case some may be wondering about that little phrase in my header.  "Living In A Suspended State Of Animated Bliss" comes from Pink Floyd.  From their song  Learning To Fly .      "There's no sensation to compare with this Suspended animation, A state of bliss"    You really should listen to the song.    Why can we send men to the moon and remote control cars to Mars, but can't come up with a cure for a cold?  Why do men have nipples?  No really.  Why?  We don't need them.  They serve no purpose.  "Ice Is Forming On The Tips Of My Wings"  Still, I want a Hummer.  Still, not that wimpy H2 but the real one.  Does anyone else like boxing?  I love to watch the middleweights, not the heavyweights.  The heavyweight fights are slow and boring.  But I hate Oscar De La Hoya.  Prettyboy's too worried about his looks.  I love cheese.  I could sit and eat a whole pack of Velveta if I were able to.  Or a nice block of sharp cheddar.  Why are the necessities of life so expensive while the wants are much cheaper?  Examples.  A home, health insurance and food are necessities.  And they cost way more than a stereo, computer or a T.V.  It's not right.   8-Tracks replaced records, cassettes replaced 8-Tracks, CD's replaced cassettes, MP3 players are replacing CD's.  What in the world will replace MP3 players?  Monty Python said it better than anyone could.      "Sit on my face  and tell me that you love me I'll sit on your face and tell you I love you, too  I love to hear you oralize  When I'm between your thighs You blow me away  Sit on my face and let my lips embrace you  I'll sit on your face and then I'll love you truly  Life can be fine if we both sixty-nine  If we sit on our faces in all sorts of places  And play,  'til we're blown away"    Oh, that's dirty.  That' all for now.  'Till next time when I bring you Random Thoughts 6.     The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       THE HELL YOU SAY   Any long time reader of this blog knows I Hate Michael Moore.  I despise him with every fiber of my being.  He's the biggest piece of shit behind the camera.  If he spent an equal amount of time checking facts as he does at Wendys then maybe his mockumentries wouldn't suck so much.  Get a load of this bit of news.  Are you ready for a shock?  Michael Moore lied to us.  I know, I know, I couldn't believe it either.  It seems that this whole  Fahrenheit 911 /Disney thing was a sham.  Recently Moore claimed that Disney pulled the plug on his newest piece of trash on Monday in a blatant attempt at political censorship.  From what I heard it was because of something between Jeb Bush and Michael Eisner and a tax break or credit or something.  But in a CNN interview Moore said he knew that Miramax, a subsidiary of Disney, had pulled out a year ago.  That they really had no intention of distributing the film.  That's shock number one.  Here's shock number two.   The New York Slimes  supports Moore.  You could have knocked me over with a feather.  In an editorial piece yesterday, the  Slimes  denounced Disney for censorship and denial of Moore's right to free expression.  My question.  Where was the  New York Slimes  when movie companies were denying Mel Gibson's  The Passion Of The Christ ?  It took him something like a year or more to find a company who would distribute it.  Was that not censorship and denial of Gibson's right to free expression?  Oh wait.  Of course.  Gibson's movie was about religion and didn't accuse Bush of lies and crimes.  So that's okay.  For a second there I forgot the Hollywood Rules.  Rule 1.  If your film shows contempt for evil, racist Republicans, it's good. Rule 2.  If your film show Republicans in ANY WAY as being good, decent or smart, it's trash. Rule 3.  If your film shows religion in a bad light, it's okay. Rule 4.  If your film shows religion in a good light, it's evil. Rule 5.  If your film shows the U.S. military in ONLY a positive way, it's bad. Rule 6.  If your film shows the U.S. military in ANYWAY negative, it's good. Rule 7.  If your film shows America in ONLY a good, positive way, that wrong. Rule 8.  If your film shows America as the evil, oppressive place we know it to be, it's a hit.

       DIRTY DISNEY JOKE   Okay, first a warning.  Some people don't like jokes like this.  It's not all that bad, but on a scale of 1-10 I'd give it maybe a 6.  Just to warn you.  I was just watching Mad TV and this joke was told on there.  I thought it was funny as hell.  Enjoy.  One day Mickey Mouse woke up and looked out his window.  In the snow he saw that someone had written "Mickey Sucks" in pee.  So Mickey called the police and they came over to investigate.  After their investigation the police said, "Mickey, we have bad news and worse news.  The bad news is that it's Goofy's urine.  The worse news is that it's Minnies handwriting".

In a new twist in the Kerry purple heart controversy, the doctor who treated Kerry for the wound in which Kerry received his first purple heart says that he thought the injury had been inadvertently self-inflicted.  Dr. Louis Letson says Kerry insisted that he was injured by enemy fire while his boat was patrolling the Mekong Delta on Dec. 2, 1968.  But some of his crew on that boat say that they didn't receive any fire from the short, but that Kerry fired a mortar at close range to some rocks on shore.  Dr. Letson says that seemed to fit the injury that he treated.  The "injury" was a small piece of metal that really hadn't even pierced the skin.  Dr. Letson said of the "wound",     "The metal fragment measured about 1 cm. in length and was about 2 or 3 mm in diameter. It certainly did not look like a round from a rifle.  I doubt that it penetrated more than 3 or 4 mm. It did not require probing to find it, did not require any anesthesia to remove it, and did not require any sutures to close the wound.  The wound was covered with a bandaid."    If this is true, then Kerry should never have received a purple heart.   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      JOHN KERRY'S WORST ENEMY        That's right.  It's not Bush, the RNC, the Republican Attack Machine or the VR-WC.  It's the attention hog himself Bill "Bubba" Clinton.  How you may ask.  Well, I'll tell you.  Right around the time of the Democratic National Convention in which 'Ol Sourpuss will received the nomination, Bill Clintons book will be coming out.  This will take away some of Kerrys steam.  The convention will be a total Clinton love fest.  Kerry's going to have to fight "Bubba" for the spotlight, even on his own day.  Then after the convention and the book release, Clinton's going be going out on tour promoting his book.  And if you don't think Big Media's not going to be showing this every night then you've been living in a hole.  While out on this book tour, Clinton's going to be throwing Kerry's name in every once and a while.  But this won't take away from the Clinton Spotlight.  Bill Clinton could cost John Kerry the election.  Which I'm sure the Clintons don't mind.  Because if Kerry wins in Nov., then Hillary will have to wait until 2012 before she could run.  That's just too long for them to wait.      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       AND IN LOCAL NEWS   A lawyer in the great state of Oklahoma is bringing a lawsuit against the Norman Police Department because they've been writing $35 tickets to people who fail to wear their seatbelts.  Oklahoma law says the max fine is $20.  15 bucks.  People are willing to waist hundreds of thousands of tax payers money to get $15.  That's one of the many things wrong with this country.  We're too damn sue happy.  People here will sue at the drop of a hat.  Even if it's our fault for being idiots.  Remember that woman who sued McDonalds because she spilled hot coffee on her lap while driving?  Duh you stupid cow.  You put hot coffee between your legs while driving what the hell do you think's going to happen?  We're getting paid for our own ignorance, and the lawyers are more than happy to help.     "Personal responsibility, what's that?  Something happened to me, it's not my fault.  Get my lawyer.  I'm suing for half a billion"    It's sad.  We cut ourselves with a steak knife, we sue the company who makes the knife.  We fall inside Wal-Mart, we sue Wal-Mart and the company who made that damned floor that we fell on for making it too slippery.  Okay, I'm over exaggerating a little, but too much.  Before you know it we'll be suing television studios for not entertaining us like we feel they should.  Huh, maybe that's not such a bad idea.

       U.N. SHOWS ONCE AGAIN IT'S NOT NEED   Any half intelligent person knows that the U.N. is an inept, outdated, un-needed organization.  And they've just given us another reason for that to be true.  In an uncontested election the U.N. has elected Sudan to the Human Rights Commission.  What's wrong with that you say.  Only a little thing called ethnic cleansing.  Get this quote from the CS Monitor    'Ethnic cleansing' in the Darfur region alarms UN official, even as peace talks resume in Chad.    and    It is, according to one UN official, the greatest humanitarian crisis in the world right now.     What the hell's going on here?  Countries on the Humans Rights Commission past, present and future: China - 1982-2002 & 2005 Cuba - 1984, 2001, 2003 & 2006 Iraq - 1979-1981, 1987-1992 Well, you get the idea.  Didn't they also appoint Iraq to the Disarmament Commission just before the war?  That just goes to show why U.N. stands for  U n- N eeded.

John Kerry in a letter to President Bush,    "As you well know, Vietnam was a very difficult and painful period in our nation’s history, and the struggle for our veterans continues.

       A TRUE TRIBUTE   Tonight on Fox News Sunday W/ Chris Wallace they're going to be doing a real tribute to the soldiers in Iraq.  They're going to be reading off the all the good things that have taken place in Iraq since the fall of Saddam.  That's how you honor someone.  Talk about the good that they did, not read their names for ratings or  for political reasons.  If you miss the first airing watch one of the repeats.  I don't know if they're going to talk about the soldiers in Afghanistan and the good they've done or not, but I hope they do.  Check out the glowing text.  It's been awhile.

       IRAQI ABUSE   You've all seen the photos of American soldiers and their abuse of the Iraqi prisoners.  This is a disgrace.  I hope these "soldiers" face the maximum punishment that's allowed.  They're now saying, through a spokeswoman, that they didn't receive in-depth training on the Geneva Conventions, which govern the handling of captives.  That they didn't know the rules.  Jeepers, who would have thought it was wrong to treat them inhumanly?  Uh, anyone with a third grade education.  This just sets us back in the middle east.  But there is something else to this.  People in the middle east are up in arms over this, as well they should be, but where was their anger when the bodies of American contractors in Iraq were being shown burned and dismembered?  They were praising this.  Both acts are bad, but I think one stands out as a whole hell of a lot worse.    NIGHTLINE   Lastnight, on ABC's Nightline, Ted Koppel read the names of the soldiers who have given their lives in Iraq.  Well, Koppel was on Sean Hannity's radio show and Hannity asked if the names of the soldiers who have given their lives in Afghanistan would be read.  Koppel said no.  His excuse,    "You know something, it's a perfectly legitimate question.  But you know, if you say the kids in Afghanistan, you know, how much further are you going to go, Sean? You know how many guys have died in how many different countries?"    That's the best he could come up with?  Why didn't he tell the truth?  That he was and is against the War in Iraq and only wanted to read those names because he feels that they would anger Americans more than the soldiers in Afghanistan would.

       THANK YOU, FIRST OFFICAL POST   As you may have read in an earlier post, which I've now deleted, the first of every month I'm going to be posting a Thank You post to the men and women in the armed forces.  It's just my way of showing my support for everything they did and are doing for me.    This post is dedicated to the men and woman who have served and are serving in the United States military.  I've never been in the armed forces, so I don't even pretend to know everything you go through or the sacrifices you have made or are making.  But I just wanted to let you know that you have people back home who love, support and respect you and who wish you a safe and speedy return. You sacrifice everything in your lives for people you don't even know.  You may not call yourselves heroes, but that's what you are.         This is something that would be great to see take off.  I'm not looking for it to be the next big internet movement, but it would be nice to see people honor and thank the men and woman who keep us safe.  What's great about this is that both Democrats and Republicans can participate.  If you would like to take part in this, just copy the bug above and save to your host site.  If you don't have one,   urlLink Photobucket   has a great free host site.  Show your support for the men and woman who defend our freedoms.

       MISSION ACCOMPLISHED        One year ago today our great leader landed on the deck of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln and declared an end to major combat in Iraq.  Above him you can see the sign that reads "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED".  Please, someone tell me what Dems have their panties in a bunch over.  Their mission was accomplished in Iraq.  The mission was to get Saddam and the Bathest party out of power, and they did just that.  I do agree however that he shouldn't have said anything about major combat being over with.  But that's the price of not having Karen Hughes by your side.  Thank God she's back.  I remember that day.  I was sitting in the hospital cafeteria and there were two woman sitting at the table in front of me.  And the first thing out of their mouths was, "He looks good in that flight suit".  And I had to agree with them.  He looked damned good wearing it.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       ANOTHER F911 LIE   Damn, these things just keep coming.  Anyway, this new one come from the scene were Moore shows Bush on the golf course talking about stopping terrorists then saying "Now, watch this swing".  Here's something I didn't know about this scene.  Did you know Bush wasn't talking about al-Queda?  He was talking about a recent Palestinian terror attack on Israel.  It had nothing to do with Sept. 11.  Moore makes it seem that Bush really didn't care about the 9/11 attacks, knowing full well that no one in the theater at the time would know the truth about what Bush was talking about.

       CAUGHT IN TWO MOORE LIE   My last post was about how I think Moore coached that poor woman in what to say to make the U.S. military seem like nothing but a bunch of heartless monsters.  Well, it seems Moore has been caught in yet two more lie in F911.  Look at the picture below.    Now, in the movie this guy is identified as Sgt. Abdul Henderson.  But look at the two Chevrons on his uniform.  Doesn't that signify a Corporal?     Corporal        Sergeant       There's lie number one. Here's lie number two.  As I've stated before, I haven't seen F911, nor do I plan to, but I have seen this scene during interviews with Moore.  In this scene, I believe Cpl. Henderson says that he will not let the military send him back to fight in either Iraq or Afghanistan.  I don't remember which.  But look at his chest.  Does anyone see either of these?       or       Those medals signify that you have fought in the War On Terror in either Iraq or Afghanistan.  Cpl. Henderson has neither.  That means he did see action in either country.    I wish I could say I was shock about this, but that would be a lie.

       THIS IS GOOD   From   urlLink Brian   about  Farenheit 9/11 .   "- The woman who lost her son in Iraq was a very sympathetic person. Who doesn't feel for a mother who has lost her son? I cannot be the only person who caught this, but I think others have and are afraid to mention it for fear of seeming insensitive. (I myself have wavered over writing this, and I only get 150 hits a day.) The woman who lost her son said that when she was told, "she dropped the phone." I thought I heard that wrong, but a moment later she said she was all alone and had "no one to hold her up." I was outraged. The United States military informs next of kin directly, without exception, no matter where they are. For example, they went deep into the mountains in Mexico to inform a lost soldier's mother directly. I am not calling the woman a liar, but I am sure that Moore intended to leave the impression that our military is completely insensitive."   Is anyone else thinking what I was thinking while reading this?  Moore coached her into saying it was a phone call instead of a face to face meeting.  There's correction number one for Truthenheit 9-11.com.  Like the name?  Good work, Brian.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       HELP ME   America handed over power to the interim Iraqi government today.  Two days early.  You know al-Zarqawi and other al-Queda members are steaming over this.  They were probably planning some big show on the 30th, but us evil Americans had to go and spoil it.  Anyway, this is another giant step towards Iraqi being a free and independent nation.  Here's where I need the help.  Why do some people not want the Iraqi people to be free and independent?  People like Michael Moore, Martin Sheen and others.  Why do/did they want to continue to see them under the iron thumb of Saddam?  Don't they believe every human on the planet deserves to be free?  I just can't understand their mentality.

       KISS THEM GOODBYE   Turkey has rejected the demands of the al-Qaida terrorists to pull out of Iraq and to end their support of America.  Which, quite frankly, surprised me.  Just like Daniel Pearl, Nick Berg, Paul Johnson and Kim Sun-Il, the families of these three hostages need to get ready for what's about to happen.  One last thing.    urlLink Steve Of Norway   asked this question.  Why is it so hard for Big Media to call these people what they are?  Terrorist.  The opening line from the Reuters story,   "Turkey rejected Sunday the demands of  militants  threatening to behead three Turks ..."   Militants?  Like Steve said,   "Ah, sounds like a militia even Michael Moore could sing the praises of"   That's why I like Fox News.  They call them what they are.  Just like "Suicide Bombers".  No, Homicide Bombers.  They're killing innocent men, women and children.  When you kill someone else, you commit homicide, not suicide.  Sorry, got off on a rant there.

       CAN KERRY EVEN RUN FOR OFFICE?   Get a load of this.    urlLink Candidate waffles   may not even be able to run for president.  Hell, according to this, he never should have been senator.  According to AMENDMENT XIV, Section 3 of the United States Constitution   "No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States,  shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof . But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability"   Basically it says that if you support the enemy, you can't run for office.  Wouldn't Kerry's post-war actions be considered insurrection or rebellion against the U.S.?  Wouldn't his calling U.S. troops killers and rapists be considered giving aid or comfort to the enemy?  I also don't remember a vote by Congress or the Senate allowing Kerry to run for office.  Kind of interesting, don't you think?  Why doesn't someone stand up and bring this to the attention of the American people?

       GUILT BY ASSOCIATION   I haven't seen  Fahrenheit 911 , nor do I have any plans on seeing it.  But from listening to Moore in interviews, one of the things I can gather that Fahrenheit's about is the Bush family's ties to the bin Laden family.  Now both are oil families, so I guess there could be ties there.  Business and maybe even personal ties.  But is Moore trying to tell us that bin Laden's family, who live in America and have disowned Osama, are guilty of the attacks on 9/11 just because they are his family?  And even more, that because W has business, and maybe even personal, ties to them, that he's even somewhat responsible for 9/11?  That's what I gather from listening to his rants.  I thought the good, open minded Liberals didn't believe in guilt by association.  Is Tito Jackson guilty of child molestation because Michael did it?  Is Moore into bestiality because his father got a hippo pregnant?  Not necessarily.  Can someone please explain this to me, because I just don't get it.

Here, as promised, are some things I would rather do than waste my money on it.  1.  Take one part hammer, two parts testicles and mix. 2.  Make a dinner of fresh dog crap with a hairball salad on the side. 3.  Listen to an 8 hour marathon of The Eagles, The Beatles and rap music. I hate all three. 4.  Watch every episode of Friends back to back. 5.  Lick a wall socket. 6.  Put a 9v battery to my tongue every 20 seconds for 2 hours. 7.  Babysit for five three-year-olds.  The horror... the horror. 8.  Walk into a KKK meeting wearing a Black Power shirt and tell them I'm mixed race. 9.  Walk into a Black Panther meeting and shout "White Power". 10. Take said hammer, turn handle side up, and as Ralph Malph use to say, Sit On It. 11. Listen to a   urlLink candidate waffles   speech.  That's bad. 12. Miss an episode of Star Trek: Enterprise.  I love that show. 13. Give up my computer. 14. Sex change.  Well, I guess number 1 would be the same thing. 15. Watch  Friday After Next .  That's a bad movie.  1 and 2 were good, but 3 sucks. 16. And finally, I would rather watch CNN for 24 hours than waste my money on  Fahrenheit 911 .  Now, it's your turn.  What would you all rather do than see this movie?

       DAMN FOX NEWS   How dare they refuse to show the commercial for Moore's  Fahrenheit 911 .  That right-wing biased "news" channel is promoting censorship by not sh... Oh, wait a minute.  I must be thinking of someone else.  Because yesterday and today I saw the ads for  Fahrenheit 911  no less than 10 times.  With Fox News showing the ads for this hate-filled Bush bash, it kind of throws the lefties argument that Fox is a puppet of the Bush Administration out the window.

       TERRORIST SUPPORT MOORE & VISE-VISA   We all know that Hezbollah has given Moore's movie, Fahrenheit 9/11, a resounding 5 homicide bombers, but it seems that Moore and his distribution company are pleased with their support.  The manager of Front Row, the distribution company, Gianluca Chacra, is quoted as saying,   "We can't go against these organizations as they could strongly boycott the film in Lebanon and Syria"   Oh, we can't offend the terrorists.  They may boycott the movie.  How does all this lend to my theory that Moore supports terrorist?  Has anyone heard Moore come out against this?  I didn't think so.  He's sitting in his Upper West Side apartment counting the money Hezbollah and al-Qaeda will be stuffing down his pockets.  Hey, as longs as this movie makes people hate Bush and America even more, then Moore has done his job.  Damn the consequences.  Just like Clinton's impeachment is his badge of honor, so must this be Moore's.

       ANOTHER ONE   al-Qaeda has beheaded Kim Sun-il.  Sadly, I can't say I'm shocked or surprised.  I don't have much to say about this except read my post about the death of Paul Johnson for my feelings.  One last thing.  Does anyone else see a resemblance between these cowards and the KKK?  They both claim what they're doing is good and right, yet they're too scared to show their faces.  Off on a tangent, I know, but I had to bring it up.

       NOW I'VE HEARD IT ALL   You've got to love defense attorneys.  They can come up with some pretty creative excuses for crimes.  Randall Vogt, a lawyer in Beaverton, OR, is saying that his client beat his 2-year-old son to death because of the white man.  It seems his client is suffering from Post Traumatic Slavery Disorder.  Because his ancestors were beaten by their white slavemasters, he's justified in the beating death of his son.  But this theory doesn't belong to Vogt, it's the work of assistant professor in the Portland State University Graduate School of Social Work, Joy DeGruy-Leary.  DeGruy-Leary testified in Washington County Circuit Court that African Americans today are affected by past centuries of U.S. slavery because the original slaves were never treated for the trauma of losing their homes; seeing relatives whipped, raped and killed; and being subjugated by whites.  You know, they may have something here.  Because the white man stole my peoples land and identity, I'm going to steal my white neighbor's stereo.  I'm justified in it, aren't I?  It's payback.  Come on, what the hell.  This guy was never a slave.  His parents weren't slaves.  His grandparents weren't slaves.  How can anyone justify anything by something that ended almost 150 years ago?  That's what's wrong with this country today.  No personal responsibility by anyone.  It's always someone else's fault.  The Government, society, t.v., music, video games, and now the past.  When are people going to stand up and take the blame for their own actions?

       THEY HAVE ANOTHER ONE   Michael Moore's heroes have kidnapped yet another innocent man, Kim Sun-il, and are threatening to behead him unless South Korea pulls their troops out of Iraq.  Unlike the Spaniards, the South Korean government has told these fucks a resounding "no".  I don't mean to sound callus or uncaring, but this guys family needs to use to the idea of never seeing him alive again.  Terrorists aren't known for they're compassion.  Don't look for them to let this Kim Sun-il go alive.  Let's see, the threat on Nick Berg's life didn't work.  The threat on Paul Johnson's life didn't work.  And the threat on Kim Sun-il's life isn't working.  When are these slow-witted assholes going to wake up and realize they're not going to win?

       HELL HAS FROZEN OVER   The New York Slimes has panned "Bubba's" book My Lies, I mean My Life.  Said the Slimes,    "The book, which weighs in at more than 950 pages, is sloppy, self-indulgent and often eye-crossingly dull Â the sound of one man prattling away, not for the reader, but for himself and some distant recording angel of history.    My Life reads like a messy pastiche of everything that Mr. Clinton ever remembered and wanted to set down in print; he even describes the time he got up at 4 a.m. to watch the inaugural ceremonies for Nigeria's new president on TV. There are endless litanies of meals eaten, speeches delivered, voters greeted and turkeys pardoned."   In other words, a real page turner.  This is only a small, small sample of what the Slimes had to say.  Go read the article for more.    This really surprised me.  I figured the Slimes would hail this as the second coming of War And Peace or The Dark Tower, Stephen King's masterpiece.  Go read them, it's an awesome story.  But that's for another post.  But this Michiko Kakutani just didn't like the book.   Credit:   urlLink New York Slimes      NEW "ARTWORK": IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY             Here we see two pictures of   urlLink candidate waffles'   great-grandfather during the Civil War.  A little know fact, Kerry's great-grandfather was a senator during Lincoln's presidency.  As you can see, taking both sides of an issue is in Kerry's blood.  Historic fact, these pictures were taking just after Al Gore's great-grandfather invented the electric microphone.  I guess inventing revolutionary things is in his blood as well.

       LIKE A THIEF IN THE NIGHT   It seems that Moore not only prays on tragedy in peoples lives, he also steals.  Author Ray Bradbury is pissed off at Moore for stealing the name of Bradbury's book, Fahrenheit 451.  Said Bradbury,    "He didn't ask my permission.  That's not his novel, that's not his title, so he shouldn't have done it."     Bradbury hasn't seen the movie, but did contact Moore's company six months ago and was told Moore would call back.  Moore called back, two weeks ago.  Moore told Bradbury that he suddenly realized that he had let too much time go forward.  One last thing in the article.  They had to mention the part where Disney refused to release the film.  They can't leave that part out.  And one last thing that may be good news for some.  Bradbury says that there are plans for a remake of Fahrenheit 451 directed by Frank Darabont.  Darabont makes some good movies.  My take on this.  All who believe Moore on this one, raise your hands.  What, no one.  That's shocking.  Just more proof that Michael Moore is a, cover your eyes and hide the kiddies, piece of used toilet paper wrapped around an old tampon stuffed in a sticky condom.  In other words, sick.  Moore uses people to his own advantage.  He doesn't care who he hurts as long as he gets his skewed point of view out.  And the people who support him are no better.    Credit:   urlLink Yahoo!

       MORE LEFT SPIN   In today's edition of my local Liberal Lies, or Tulsa World, newspaper, there's piece in the editorial section titled No Link.  It's about the Kangaroo Commissions findings.  The piece starts off with   "That thud you heard Wednesday came from the White House.  The reason was that the 9/11 commission reported that there was never any link between Iraq and al-Qaida or between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001"   1.  The reports actually doesn't say there wasn't a link between Saddam and al-Qaida.  It's been proven that there was 2.  Bush NEVER said that Saddam had anything to do with 9/11.  He never made a connection or used it as a reason to go into Iraq.  It went on to say   "That link was, in fact, one of the main selling points in President Bush's pitch to invade Iraq in the first place."   I believe I've already covered this.     "No doubt, Saddam was a tyrant and a mass murderer, but those were not the main reasons given for the invasion.  It is doubtful that the American public would have approved the invasion based solely on removing Saddam because he was a bad guy."   Actually, I think they would have.     "It was the threat of weapons of mass destruction and the possible connection with the terrorist of 9/11 - although 15 of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia - that rallied the support of most America for the invasion.  There have been no WMD's found yet and now the 9/11 connection has been debunked."   No WMD's?  What was that sarin filled bomb?  What about the Useless Nations report that said Saddam did have WMD's and shipped them to other countries before and during the war?     "The attempt to tie 9/11 to Saddam was a mistake."   Ahh...Never mind.     "It's time to tell the truth.  The American people can handle it."   I agree.  Right minded Americans can handle the truth.  It's the American Left that have trouble with the truth.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       HAPPENED AGAIN   The religion of peace has beheaded another American.  The al-Qaeda members who kidnapped Paul Johnson in Saudi Arabia are claiming to have beheaded him.  There's an Islamic website that's showing pictures of the beheading.  This doesn't shock or surprise me in the least.  Islam is a breeding ground for terrorists.  This just helps prove it.  If this statement offends you, too bad.  You can bet this won't be the last time this happens either.  The Saudis can pretend to be a friend of America all they want, but they're nothing more than an open bank account and a safe haven for terrorists.

       HIGHER EDUMICATION   The following is from a New York American History Regents test given to juniors in the state.  Tell me what's missing.   "Question 41: In 1991, one of the reasons President George H. W. Bush committed United States troops to the Persian Gulf War was to  "(1) maintain the flow of trade through the Suez Canal  "(2) fulfill military obligations as a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)  "(3) contain the spread of communism in the Middle East  "(4) assure the flow of Middle East oil to the United States and its allies"   If you said (5) help the Kuwaitis from an invading Iraq, you would be correct.  Funny how the right answer didn't make it on the test.  I guess the Republican loving educators in NY just made a simple mistake.  Didn't they?  There's the slam to H.W., now here's the slam to W.   "Question 4: A major criticism of the electoral college system has been that  "(1) party loyalty is weakened after a presidential election  "(2) electors frequently fail to vote for a candidate  "(3) members of the electoral college are appointed for life terms  "(4) a president may be elected without receiving the majority of the popular vote"   But maybe they're talking about "Bubba" in that one, because Clinton failed to receive a majority of the popular vote in 92 and 96.  Yeah, that's it.  The Republican loving NY educators must have been talking about Clinton and not Bush.  Just another reason why our schools are so screwed up.

She hasn't been register since the 70's, and as a Democrat at that.  But this time she register as a Republican.  One more for the club.  I don't think she's ready for the conspiracy yet, but it's a step in the right, no pun intended, direction.  How did I get her to register?  It's not because of the presidential election, congressional or any political reasons.  It's because come this November, the great state of Oklahoma will have a vote for a state lottery on the ballot.  She wants a lottery, so after I reminded her about it she registered.

       WE DID IT AGAIN   The VR-WC has struck another blow to the left-wing.  We were successfully able to get the MPAA to slap an   urlLink R rating   on Michael Moore's new used diaper of a movie, Fahrenheit 9/11.  Hollywood may be a extreme left-wing town, but never underestimate the power of the conspiracy.  We have fingers everywhere.  I only wish I had been a part of this one, but alas, I wasn't.  We tried for an X rating, for X-treamly full of crap, but that didn't pan out.  Our next project is getting Michael Wilson's   urlLink Michael Moore Hates America   to open in over 2,500 theaters.

       MELTDOWN   I was watching a movie last night on the cable channel FX.  It was called Meltdown and it was about terrorists who take over a nuclear power plant in America and plan to blow it up.  Sounds scary, right?  But I had to stop watching it because of the terrorists.  They weren't Arab Muslims, that would racist.  They were, get this, United States soldiers.  That's right, G.I. Joes.  From what I could get from the story, these soldiers had UBL cornered and were about to get him when the State Department ordered them to leave so a convoy could pass through.  In doing so, they lost bin Laden.  They got angry at the U.S. Government and so they planned to blow up a nuclear power plant.  Sounds reasonable, doesn't it?  I can't tell you how many terrorist out there are U.S. soldiers.  I'll list them for you.    1.  Timothy McVeigh  There he is.  One, that's all I could come up with.  Remember awhile back I   urlLink posted   the rules for making a Hollywood movie?  Well, here's an example of rule number 6.     Rule 6. If your film shows the U.S. military in ANYWAY negative, it's good.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying all Muslims are terrorists, because they're not.  But most terrorists are Muslim.  But hey, when we can't show the truth about terrorism, then let's go to the next best thing.  The American soldier, because everyone knows the U.S. soldier is the most evil force on the planet.

       NOPE, NOPE, NOPE        For his 80th birthday today, former President Bush made, I believe, his sixth jump.  This was to be his first solo jump, but weather conditions put a stop to that.  Maybe next time.  After landing, Mr. Bush said   "For me, I like speed. I like the thrill of it.  But the jump also sets an example for older people, here and abroad, that just because you're 80 years old, it doesn't mean you're out of it."   Good for him.  Show 'em you're not ready for the walker and Geritol just yet.  Why the title some may be saying.  Because there is no way in hell you would ever get me jump from a plane.  I'm scared to death of heights and speed.  And jumping from some 10,000 feet and falling at over 100 MPH isn't something that's on my "to do" list.

All because one stupid juror believed the crap the defense attorney told them about Nichols being a changed man because he "found religion" in prison.  Funny how he found it just after he was told he may get death.  When the jury is deadlocked, the judge must bring a sentence.  But under Oklahoma law, the judge isn't allowed to issue a death sentence.  They're only allowed life with parole or without parole.  I swear, if this judge gives him parole I'm going to be the first one there calling for him to step down from the bench.  Even before O'Reilly can call for it.  168.  He gets to live while 168 people are dead.   IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIII  iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  Let's say that each of of those I's is a human life Nichols help take.  That's a lot of people.  Those little red i's, those are the 19 children that were killed.  This one juror that couldn't bring themselves to give Nichols the death penalty, I guess they either couldn't or wouldn't allow his/her mind to hear them scream for help.  Crying for their mommies or daddies.  Couldn't see their bodies crushed under 4 ton pieces of concrete and steel.  I don't know, it's not too hard for me to picture it.

       FINAL TRIBUTE   President Reagan will finally be layed to rest today back in California.  Did you see the procession today?  It was kind of poetic.  During Reagan's inaugural address, the clouds parted and the sun began to shine.  And today, as his body was being taken to the cathedral, the clouds opened and it began to rain.  It's as if even mother nature knew the kind of man Ronald Reagan was.  Bright sunshine for the beginning and sad rain for the end.  I made a final tribute to Reagan.  It's not a spectacular piece of work.  The cut is bad and it's very simple and basic.  But I like it.  I wanted a picture that I felt portrayed the real Ronald Reagan.  I want to thank   urlLink Jeff Stark   for hosting it for me.  It's too big to post here, it's 1024x768 and almost 500K, so I'll just post the link.  I hope you like it.

       CHOCOLATE'S GOOD FOR YOU   To get away from the politics for awhile, there's a study out that shows dark chocolate may be good for your heart.  Research shows that small amounts of dark chocolate improve blood vessel function, which in turn improves circulation and therefore benefits the heart.  Scientists gave 11 people 46 grams of dark, flavonoid-rich chocolate every day for a fortnight, however long that is, and the arteries in the subjects given the chocolate with the higher flavonoid content had a greater capacity to expand.  If this is true, then my heart must be as healthy as a horse.  See ladies, when we men give you chocolate, that's just our way of wanting you to live longer and be healthier.

       REAGAN IN WASHINGTON   I was just watching the procession to the Capital Building and I just wanted to post on something.  I'm usually able to keep my emotions in check, for the most part.  Side story.  A few years ago a wrestler, Owen Hart, died in the ring.  I had never met the man, didn't know a thing about him.  But the next night, his fellow wrestlers were all gathered around the ring to honor him.  When they showed his picture on the screen and started to ring the bell 10 times, I lost it.  That almost what happened here.  It wasn't the flag draped casket, the riderless horse or even Nancy looking so lost and alone.  It was the 21 ship flyover the USAF did.  I have no idea why that almost made me cry.  Maybe it was because it was an overwhelming site seeing the planes fly overhead.  Maybe it was distance between the groups, or maybe it was the lone plane ahead of the groups.  I don't know, but at that moment I almost lost it.  It happened yesterday as well.  When the band started playing taps.  Taps always gets to me.  Just that one bugle playing by itself, it's such a sad sound.  I'm actually starting to well up now just thinking about it.  Friday when they finally lay President Reagan to rest, if they play taps, and I'm sure they will, I more than likely  will break down.   Sort of on the same subject.  I was thinking earlier how life is so unfair.  How it's not right that we should have to feel such great pain when we loose someone.  Ronald and Nancy Reagan were married for 52 years.  They were each other's lives.  Now that Nancy doesn't have her husband by her side anymore after 52 years, I can't even imagine the hole that's been left in her heart.  I wish I knew why we have to feel pain like this.  I'm sure everyone reading this has lost someone in their lives, but loosing someone after 52 years.  It's just unimaginable to me.  I wanted to end this with some great line.  Something that would wrap it up in a nicely, but I honestly can't think of anything that would end it right.  So I'll just end it by saying something that may seem a little cheesy.  If I could take Nancy Reagan's pain away and replace it with joy and happiness, I would.  No one deserves to suffer though something like this.  Especially someone like her.    We Have Every Right To Dream Heroic Dreams.

       BUBBA MORE POPULAR THAN THE GIPPER?   Dems have flipped their lids now.  Some are claiming that Bill Clinton was more popular than Reagan.  I wish you all could have heard my laughter as I read this.  Their using some Zogby poll as proof.  I guess Reagan winning 49 states in 1984 and Clinton never winning more than 49% in either election wasn't what they wanted to hear.  Do they really thing this country would show so much emotion if it were "Bubba" who died instead of Reagan?  I think not.  We also wouldn't have people saying "good deal" either like we do now.   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      POLLS   Can someone please explain these things to me?  In a recent Zogby poll, they asked only 950 people who they would vote for.  How is this a representation of the wants of the American people.  Oh, by the way, this poll says that Kerry's lead is shrinking over W.

       WISH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS     urlLink Steve Of Norway   makes a great point.  What  are  the chances of Republicans turning Reagans death into a political rally, ala Paul Wellstone?  I make a comment in my last post about the difference between Dems and Republicans.  Well, here's another one.  At Paul Wellstone's memorial service, they turned that into a Right-Wing hate fest.  We Republicans just have more descentcy than that.  President Reagan's memorial service will be what it should be.  Friends and family honoring a great man, not a Left-Wing bash fest with people screaming at the top of their lungs disgracing the man.

See, that's what separates Conservatives from Liberals.  No matter how much we hate Clinton, if he were to die tomorrow not one Conservative columnist would say anything like this.

       MY THOUGHTS   I wanted to make this quick post.  They announced the funeral plans for President Reagan today.  All I have to say is I hope they don't actually show him at any time during this period on any of the news channels.  Not because I think it's disrespectful or anything like that, but because I want to remember him the way he was before Alzheimer's got him.  I personally wouldn't want to see him like that.  That's why I'm glad I don't live anywhere near California or D.C.  The temptation to go to one of the public viewings would be too great.  I'm surprised his family agreed to a public viewing of his body.  No, I want to remember him strong and full of life.    We Have Every Right To Dream Heroic Dreams.

To be on those boats, knowing what was ahead of you, knowing that there was a good chance you wouldn't see the tomorrow and still standing steadfast.  You showed what America was all about.  You spent some three years fighting through out Europe to make it to Berlin to stop Hitler and the Nazi Party.  Three years away from your family and everything that you knew.  Thank You.

       PRESIDENT REAGAN DIES        1911-2004    As you should have heard, Ronald Reagan has finally lost his 10 year battle with Alzheimers.  This post won't be a long drawn out post.  I don't think that's needed.  Just short and sweet.  Ronald Reagan was the first president that I really took notice of.  I was only a year old when he was first elected, but I was 9 when he left office.  He's actually one of the first memories that I have as a child.  Reagan will always be the model for every Republican politician to aspire to be like.  The thing that made Ronald Reagan the greatest president of the 20th century was his unwillingness to compromise to what others thought he should be.  When he said he would do something, he did it.  A man of his word.   "Wisps of distant memories, Are dancing in my soul; The sweetness and the sadness, Will follow wherever I go. For I will take you with me, My heart will hold you near; While wisps of distant memories, Will mingle with my tears.   Arms that held me with such strength, Will hold me still, at night; In dreams of you, my comfort comes, Until the morning light. Then in the dawn of each new day, I'll look there for your face; In wisps of distant memories, Time never can erase.  I'll see you in the evening, In the setting of the day; Your memory will hold me near, You'll never be far away. When I am standing on the shore, And waves come crashing in; I will hear your voice as it whispers, Upon the ocean wind.  Deep within my shattered heart, Amid the bittersweet pain; In wisps of distant memories, Your love will still remain.  Until I take my final breath..."  Allison Chambers Coxsey       We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that we're in a time when there are no heroes, they just don't know where to look.  - January 20, 1981

       I LOVE JOHN KERRY   Remember when Kerry blurted out that leaders around the world have secretly told him that they want him to live?  Okay, that's a dumb question.  But he's at it again.  His new line is that many in the U.S. military are privately telling him that they would prefer him as commander in chief over W.   "You'd be amazed at the number of active duty personnel who are coming up at events around the country, greeting me in ropelines or coming to rallies and telling me how important it is for us to stand up and fight for those who are not able to speak out for themselves right now for obvious reasons."   I guess   urlLink candidate waffles   hasn't received the new   urlLink CBS poll   that says vets prefer Bush over Kerry 54% to 40%.  Boy, everything Kerry hears is in private.  Kind of convenient, isn't it?  No one around to hear it.  No one to prove him wrong.   Credit:   urlLink My Way News      MORE MOORE'S SPIN   In Moore's newest colostomy bag of a film, he ambushes members of Congress and the Senate and asks them if they would be willing to send their family to Iraq to fight.  Well, it seems that Moore asked Rep. Mark Kennedy that question and Kennedy told Moore that he had two nephews in the military and that one of them had just be deployed to Iraq.  Somehow, that didn't make it into Moore's mockumentry.  Gee, how could that happen.  Moore doesn't like to spin things to fit his view, does he?  Speaking of Moore.

       OH SWEET JESUS   Starting Friday, Sweden will role out a new ambulance service.  A condom ambulance service.  Randy Swedes will be able to call the number 696969, what's that mean, and the service will roll out to their home with a pack of 10 condoms for their use for 50 crowns or $6.72.   "We need to increase the usage of condoms.  It is 50 percent about pregnancy and 50 percent about sexually transmitted diseases."   Said Carl Osvald, marketing manager for the Swedish Organization for Sex Education.  I guess teaching abstinence is against the law in Sweden.  I know the Left would like it to be illegal here in the states.  Thankfully this stupid program will only run until the 25th of June.  And this is the health care some want in this country?  Socialist Health Care, it's easier to get a pack of condoms from emergency services than it is to get help for a heart attack.   Credit:   urlLink Yahoo!      KERRY GIVE FINGER TO VIETNAM VET   Let's see how many Big Media outlets cover this story.  We all know Ted Sampley.  Former Green Beret, and webmaster over at   urlLink Vietnam Veterans Against John Kerry  .  Well, yesterday at the Vietnam Memorial Wall,   urlLink candidate waffles   flipped him off in front of a bunch of school children.  It seems that Sampley noticed Kerry at the wall surrounded by his Secret Service.  He then went over to Kerry and said   "Senator, I am Ted Sampley, the head of Vietnam Veterans Against John Kerry, and I am here to escort you away from the Wall because you do not belong here."   Secrete Service then told Sampley to back away from   urlLink waffles  .  Sampley then moved back 6 feet away.  And opened his shirt to reveal his Hanoi John T-shirt he was wearing underneath.  Kerry then began to talk to the group of school children.  Sampley then showed his T-shirt to the children and said   "Kerry does not belong at the Wall because he betrayed the brave soldiers who fought in Vietnam."   That's when Kerry, in front of the children, Secrete Service and other visitors flipped Sampley off and yelled   "Sampley is a felon!"   referring to 12 years ago when Sampley broke the nose of John McCain's chief aide, Mark Salter, in a Senate stairwell after McCain repeatedly offended POW families at a Senate POW hearing.  But that's your Democratic candidate for president.  That's who some want in the White House?  If he flips the bird in front of school children when confronted by something he doesn't like, what's he going to do during debates with Bush?  Just more proof that Kerry doesn't care for the American soldier.   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       DON'T COUNT HIM OUT JUST YET   With Bush's poll numbers slipping to their lowest point ever, it doesn't look too good for him in Nov.  But like the title says, don't count him out just yet.  A lot of people are still to this day underestimating him.  If you'll remember back to the 2000 election, everyone underestimated him.  Calling him an idiot who didn't know what he was doing.  But I think he's proved them wrong.  He would flub words all the time.  But can you remember the last time he's done that since he's been president?  I think it was all a ruse.  He's not a dumb as some want to portray him.  He may not be the smartest person on Earth, but he's crafty.  People will continue to underestimate him.  Saying that this election is Kerry's to loose.  I hope I'm right in saying this, but watch what happens around August, September, October.  I think Bush may surprise us all and regain the lead in the polls.  Some are saying that this election will be a landslide victory for one of the two rather than the close call everyone believes it will be.  I don't know about that though.  I think this will be just as close, if not closer, than the 2000 election.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       I NEED YOUR HELP   I need some help.  There's oil leaking from the muffler on my lawnmower.  As it's coming out it's burning on the muffler.  I called a repair shop and they said to check the oil level to make sure it didn't have too much oil.  I checked and come to find out it did have too much.  So I drained it to the correct level, but oil's still leaking from the muffler.  Does anyone know why this is happening?  Could it just be oil left in the muffler that's coming out?  I removed it but no oil comes out of it.  Will running it like this hurt the mower in anyway, because I've got to get my yard mowed.

       OUR CHOICE       or     Remember when Bush landed on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln?  Dems had a field day with the flight suit.  But now that there's a picture of Kerry in his Umpa Lumpa suit, they're crying foul.  One looks like an idiot in suit that looks stupid, and the other is George W. Bush.  Who would you rather run this country during a war?    FRESH FACES AT FOX   I was just watching  Fox News Watch  and I had a thought.  Why doesn't Fox News hire younger people for on air shows?  As much as I like Brit Hume, Tony Snow and Cal Thomas I don't relate to them.  We're from totally different generations.  Fox should take a step towards really grabbing the young audience.  Bring in some people who are under 35.  You know, people who have at least heard of Triumph The Insult Comic Dog.  Alan Colmes, I'm talking you to.  I still say give Michelle Malkin her own show.  Get some bright eyed and bushy tailed Dems and Conservatives on there.  The news is too stuffy as it is.

       BATTER UP      Mr. Kerry, who's your favorite Red Sox player? Eddie Yost Uh, Mr. Kerry.  Eddie Yost never played for Boston. I didn't say Eddie Yost.  I said Randy Johnson.  It's a conspiracy by the Right-Wing. Randy Johnson never played for Boston either, sir. Uh, uh, uh.  Bush is evil.  In an interview,   urlLink Candidate Waffles   said that Eddie Yost was his favorite BoSox player.  But as you can see, Yost never played for Boston.  I made the Randy Johnson part up.  But it shows that Kerry will say what ever it takes to get people to like him.  He said he's a Red Sox fan, but he didn't know Yost never played for them.

       STILL IN DENIAL   Just watching H&C and Hannity was talking to Jeanne Garofalo.  Did anyone else watch this?  This girl is wacked out.  She kept calling Bush a liar, yet when Sean asked her if Kerry was a liar for saying the same thing about Saddam and WMD, she refused to say it.  Kerry was given bad info, but Bush, given the same info, lied.  When Sean told her about a recent poll that says 55% of Americans believe Kerry says what people want to hear rather than what he believes, he first words to come out of her mouth?  "What what is it?  A NewsMax poll."  When Sean told her it was an ABC/Washington Post poll, she just kind of stuttered and "Oh".  You could see her trying her best not to go into the Democratic talking points of how Bush is an evil Nazi liar.  These people can't see the truth for the hatred that clouds their eyes.  I use to be a fan of her's.  She was a fairly decent actress and not too shabby looking.  Then she let the real Jeanne Garofalo out of the bag.  She's as insane as Howie D.  That's Howard Dean for those readers who weren't with me during the primaries.  Then she chopped her hair and dyed it blonde.  That was bad.  But at least she let it go back to black.

       PEOPLE DON'T CARE   Last night, Kerry's speech pulled in a combined 12.9 rating.  That's from all 3 of the Big Media networks.  That's down from Gore's 13.8 rating in 2000.  A rerun of CSI an hour earlier pulling in an 11.3 on it's own.  It's gets a little better.  Viewership of Kerry's speech actually went down during the speech itself.  He can't hold an audience.  He's too boring.  Unlike Bush.  Did anyone watch his speech this morning?  He was on fire.  He speaks with real passion.  Kerry speaks with passion when the polls tell him to.  If Bush says half the things he said in his speech this morning during the debates, he'll leave Kerry slack jawed and confused.    NUMBERS ARE UP   Thanks to the convention, the Kerry/Edwards ticket has gotten the bounce everyone talked about.  Only it's not a big a people thought it would be.  5%.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't the naming of a VP and your parties convention give you at least a 10-15% bounce?  Kerry had actually been going down in the polls until the convention.  Could this mean something about what people think about Kerry/Edwards?  Could be.   Credit:   urlLink Reuters      NEW "ARTWORK":  THE TWO TIME HERO       We all know how Kerry turned his swift boat around in 'Nam to save one of his crewmates.  But did you all know that's not the only life Kerry's has saved?  It's true.  It seems that one day the Kerry clan was waiting at a dock when one of his daughters hampster cage fell into the water.  With no regard of his own safety, Kerry grabbed an oar and fished the cage out.  I'll let Alexandra Kerry describe it for you.   "My dad jumped in, grabbed an oar, fished the cage from the water, hunched over the soggy hamster and began to administer CPR.  There are still to this day some reports of mouth-to-mouth, but I admit it's probably a trick of memory"   And starting next week, Licorice the hampster will on the road with Kerry/Edwards to talk about the Senators heroic actions.  Just a note.  I couldn't stop laughing while I was typing that last line.  This is a funny story.

       DISMISSED        urlLink Candidate Waffles   walks on stage and give the line he hopes will be the headline for tomorrow.  " I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty ".  Real headline for tomorrow?   Convention Ends With Faux Patriotism .  I thought it was priceless the Dems trying to show how much they love America, even though they put it down every chance they get.  All the flags, the red, white and blue balloons and confetti.  Made me what to sing Born In The U.S.A, which by the way isn't a patriotic song.  Just read the lyrics.  It talks about being born in a country that could care less about you.  Kerry's slogan was "Help Is On The Way".  He's right.  Come August 30th and the Republican National Convention.  We'll finally be able to wash the bad taste of Kerry Lovefest '04 out of our mouths.  One last thing.    urlLink This   accidentally aired on CNN.  It's the DNC Convention director.  Take a listen.

       NEW BLOG   I've added a new blog to enjoy.  Random Pensées.  Sorry it took so long to get your blog up, but welcome to our little blogosphere.    THE NEW MOUSE     I know all of you have been on the edge of your seat wondering about the new mouse I ordered.  Well, I finally got it yesterday.  Give me a week and I'll have a full review on my favorites blog for you.  But as of right now, it doesn't look too good .   UNFIT FOR COMMAND   This is good.  There's a new book coming out in August called  Unfit For Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry .  As you can guess, it's about   urlLink Candidate Waffles  .  Kerry likes to talk about his "band of brothers" who support him, but it seems only 2 of the 23 Swift boat commanders from Coastal Division 11 support his candidacy.  This book will talk, in detail, about how 2 of Kerry's Purple Hearts were awarded because of self inflicted wounds.  I don't buy political books like this, but I may have to get this one.  It's already #2 on Amazon.com   Credit:   urlLink Drudge      AND ACTION   The staged scenes in Kerry's Vietnam deepen.  Not too much to talk about here, but this was great.   "Kerry would revisit ambush locations for reenacting combat scenes where he would portray the hero, catching it all on film. Kerry would take movies of himself walking around in combat gear, sometimes dressed as an infantryman walking resolutely through the terrain. He even filmed mock interviews of himself narrating his exploits. A joke circulated among Swiftees was that Kerry left Vietnam early not because he received three Purple Hearts, but because he had recorded enough film of himself to take home for his planned political campaigns."   That's from the new book above.  I think I'm going to have to get this book now.

       AWESOME   It is now 7:37 pm CDT, and as of this time this blog has received 88 unique visits.  That's the most in one day I've ever gotten.  I've noticed in the past few weeks that number going up.  Has my little internet home taken off?  I don't know about all that, but it has reached heights that I never would have thought it could.  My one year blogiversay is coming up in September, and I now have a goal.  To reach 100 unique hits in one day before Sept. 15.  Only you can make this dream come true.  There's something just a cool that's been happening.  I've been getting a few hits from the military as well.  Mostly the Coast Guard, but also some Navy and just today a hit from the Air Force.  It's only 2% of the total visits, but that's 2% that seem to like my blog.  Now if only the word could get out to the USMC, Army and the rest.  Thank you everyone.    EDIT    Excuse me while I do my little jig.      A mere three and a half hours after this post, my goal was reached.  107.  Yes.  First time over 100 in a single day.  New goal, 200 in a single day.

       CELEBRITY REPUBLICANS   I was just flipping through the channels and came across Larry King.  They had Ben Affleck and Al Sharpton on there.  They were talking about the overwhelming majority of celebs being Dems.  Affleck seems to think Hollywood's 50/50 Dem and Republican.  My laugh at that statement isn't the point of this post.  As they were talking about this, I had a thought.  We Republicans may not have many celebs in our camp, but the ones we do have are quality people.  Bo Derek, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kelsey Grammer, Rick Schoder, Clint Eastwood and Danny Aiello just to name almost all of them.  Not like Whoopi Goldberg, George Clooney and Barbra Streisand who are low-class and low quality.  And may I add that I respect Affleck.  He hasn't stooped to the level so many other celebs have.  Sure he's gotten his jabs in, but that's to be expected.  We jab Dems, they jab us, but Ben Affleck hasn't felt the need to sink to the level of bottom feeder.  I respect him for that.  He's one of very, very few in Hollywood who actually act like a human being.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       I WANT TO THANK THE MINUTEMEN   Boy, was I ever wrong.  I gave my prediction on how much  F911  would make at around $44 million.  It's now broke the $100 million mark.  I love this line from the article,   "As 'Fahrenheit 9/11' crossed the $100 million mark this weekend, a first for a feature-length, theatrically released documentary,  Michael Moore noted that a new benchmark has thus been set for  nonfiction films  ."   Point of correction.   F911  isn't a nonfiction film.  One lie after another has already been proven.  Hell, even the 911 Commission proved Moore to be a liar.  But $100 million.  That's some good blood money.  And all it took for Moore to earn that $100 million is the death of 3,000+ human lives.  Good job, Mikey.   Credit:   urlLink Yahoo! News      SHOVE IT   I'm sure we've all heard about Teresa Kerry telling Colin McNickle, the editorial page editor from the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, to "shove it".  Some history first.  Mrs. Kerry said the following,   "We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics"   When McNickle asked Teresa what she meant by un-American, she denied even saying it.  Even thought it's on tape.  When McNickle asked about it again, Kerry replied   "You said something I didn't say. Now shove it."   A couple of things about this.  First, this shouldn't be unexpected.  Teresa isn't the classy, proper lady Laura Bush is.  And second, I really don't see the problem.  I've seen reporters at work.  There've been times I would have said more than just shove it.  Reporters need to be put in line.  So don't go getting your hopes up this will hurt   urlLink Candidate Waffles   and   urlLink "Baby Face" Edwards  , because this is really a non-issue.

How many times will   urlLink Candidate Waffles   mention that he fought in Vietnam? 4.  Why is Ron Reagan dragging his father's memory though the mud by participating in this partisan debacle that will do nothing but slam the party the man loved? 5.  Will Teresa Kerry mention the fact that she's African American again? 6.  Is there still two Americas, or is it back to one? 7.  And finally, how long into Al "Nut Job" Gore's rant will he loose it and begin to foam at the mouth and need the nice men in white coats to come out with the nets?

       POOR HAS-BEEN SINGER   It's happened again.  A group of fans in Livermore, California I'm guessing, walked out on Linda Ronstadt during a concert.  She had the people in the palm of her hands while the show was going on.  Then towards the end, he again began giving her political views on Moore's  F911  and fans began to walk out on her.  One fan said in the parking lot,   "She just had to do it"     Another one yelled to a camera crew,   "It was good until the end"     When are these celebs going to figure out that when we pay out hard earned money for a concert, we're not paying for their political views?  And Ms. Ronstadt really needs to watch out.  There's not too many people that would pay to see her concerts anymore anyway.  She doesn't need to be alienating the few that do.

       JOKES   I'm bored and there's nothing to post on, so I thought I would share some funny jokes I found on the net.  Enjoy.   There's a teacher in a small Massachusetts town. She asks her class how many of them are Kerry fans.  Not really knowing what a Kerry fan is, but wanting to be liked by the teacher, all the kids raise their hands except one boy--Johnny.   The teacher asks Johnny why he has decided to be different. Johnny says, "I'm not a Kerry fan."   The teacher says, "Why aren't you a Kerry fan?"   Johnny says, "I'm a George W. Bush fan." The teacher asks why he's a Bush fan. The boy says, "Well, my mom's a Bush fan, and my Dad's a Bush fan, so I'm a Bush fan!"   The teacher is kind of angry, because this is Massachusets, so she says, "What if you're Mom was a moron, and you're dad was an idiot, what would that make you?"   Johnny says, "That would make me a Kerry fan."  ----------------------------------------------------   A group of people were in a shipwreck and were stranded on an island.   The group consisted of 12 women and 1 man. After a few months, the women grew horny and it was decided that the man needed to take two women a day and they allowed him to have Sundays off.   One day on a day off, he was just relaxing when he noticed a boat nearing. He felt hopeful that maybe they would be rescued, at last.   The boat was almost to the island when the guy noticed it was a man in the boat. As he got out the first guy said "Oh my God buddy, am I ever glad to see YOU, To which the second guy responded "Well alright sweetie! It's been a long time for me too."   The first man exclaimed "Oh hell, there go my Sundays!"  ------------------------------------------------------------   "I am Kerry of Borg. Your incomes will be assimilated."  -------------------------------------------------------   A Republican and a Democrat were walking down the street when they came to a homeless person.   The Republican gave the homeless person his business card and told him to come to his business for a job. He then took twenty dollars out of his pocket and gave it to the homeless person.   The Democrat was very impressed, and when they came to another homeless person, he decided to help. He walked over to the homeless person and gave him directions to the welfare office. He then reached into the Republican's pocket and got out twenty dollars. He kept $15 for administrative fees and gave the homeless person five.

       MY FIRST HATE MESSAGES   I've been blogging for almost a year now and until today I've never received any hate mail or even really any hate messages.  But that's all changed, and I couldn't be happier.  Look at the Haloscan messages for the posts  WELL, WHICH IS IT ,  WHAT'S HE HIDING  and  A REASON TO LIVE .  Some chickenshit coward who's too scared to even give his real name has left some pretty vicious messages.  Read them and you'll come across some real beauties like   "Total fucking ignorant neocon garbage. Go fuck yourself."   Which I take to mean,  I'm really jealous of you and can only wish that could be more like you .    And   "Doing nothing would be better that the slimeball scumbag buyllshit rancid GOP lies you served up. And by the way, I fucked your mother"   Which means,  The Republican party is the party that will lead this country to unimaginable greatness when W wins a second term in November.  Oh, and I like to have sex with 70 year old women .    And my absolute favorite    "You aren't good enough to dispose of Sandy Berger's personal waste. Your're an absolute scumbag fuckhead. Your mother sucks Iraqi prisoners off"   Which means,  Sandy Berger is a lying piece of crap, just like his former boss.  You are so smart and awesomely cool.   There it is ladies and gentlemen.  The perfect example of the Democratic Party today.  The party of hate and ignorance.  Boy, have they come a long way since FDR and JFK.  And one last thing anonymous coward, I'm proud to be a lying scumbag GOP neocon.  As Donald Duck once said, it's the only life for me.

       SHORT STORY   As nobody knows, I like to write short stories.  I don't often share them with people, but I've finally got enough courage, or stupidity maybe, to   urlLink share   one with you all.  It's not very good, I mean, I just barely passed English in high school.  There's errors and bad grammar and the like, as you all know by my posts here.  But don't judge it on that, judge it for the story.  Mostly I like to write horror/suspense.  This is the first time that I've tried my hand at comedy.  So go read it and let me know what you think.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       WELL, WHICH IS IT?   It seems the whole Democratic party is taking it's cue from   urlLink Candidate Waffles  .  Taking both sides of an issue.  If you listen to the Dems, Bush is a simple minded idiot who can't even put his pants on right.  But these same Dems also claim that's he's somehow the genius mastermind behind the theft of the 2000 election, 9/11, Joe Wilson's wife being exposed, the timing of the capture of Saddam and that he already has bin Laden in custody and is waiting for the coming election to announce it so his poll number will go up causing him to win a second term.  I'm surprised Bush hasn't been blamed for the death of JFK, Elvis and creation of the Ford Pinto.  So, back to my question.  Which is it?  My view, he's smarter than he lets on.  You can't be a total idiot and be president, unless you're Jimmy Carter.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       FREEDOM OF CHOICE   I was watching  Tough Crowd  last night, and they did a segment that asked "Who would you rather sleep with.  The Bush twins or the Kerry daughters?".  I won't go that far, but it brings up an interesting question.  Guys, and maybe some girls, if you are, or were, single, who would you rather date.    Barbara & Jenna Bush or     Alexandra & Vannessa Kerry?  Try to keep politics out of it.  Just go with the superficial details.  You know, who looks better.  Myself, I'd have to pick the Bush twins.  Especially Jenna, the blonde.  I love a girl with a little meat on her bones.  The other three are too damn skinny.  And also, the Kerry girls look too much like their father, and...no.  I don't think so.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       A REASON TO LIVE   Al Franken finally has a reason to live.  His show,  The Al Franken Show , beat  The Radio Factor  in New York City.  In the months of April-June, Franken received a 2.6 share compared to O'Reilly's 1.1.  However, Rush whipped both their asses.  I love this part of the story.   "Franken launched Air America amid much fanfare on March 31 as a liberal radio alternative to a predominantly right-leaning talk show culture whose ranks include such personalities as Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and O'Reilly.  But the network soon ran into management and financial troubles.  With a new group of executives in charge and investors committing more capital,  network insiders have said the venture is bouncing back . Air America now claims 17 stations nationwide, plus a presence on the XM and Sirius satellite radio networks"   Bouncing back.  That's good.  I'd like to know what network insiders are say this.  Les Moonves.  Ted Turner perhaps.    Credit:   urlLink Yahoo! News      STAND BY YOUR MAN   Hillary proved that he's a Stand By Your Man kind of person, and now "Bubba's" showing that he is as well.  Bill's standing by his national security adviser, Sandy Berger.   "We were all laughing about it on the way over here," the former president said of the investigation into Samuel "Sandy" Berger on classified terrorism documents missing from the National Archives. "People who don't know him might find it hard to believe. But ... all of us who've been in his office have always found him buried beneath papers"   Well, of course they were all laughing about it.  The entire Clinton Administration is full of scandals, lies and crimes they got away with.  They know Berger will walk away with just a slap on the wrist.    Credit:   urlLink Denver Post      NUCLEAR MISSILES FOUND IN IRAQ?      "Iraqi security reportedly discovered three missiles carrying nuclear heads concealed in a concrete trench northwest of Baghdad, official sources said Wednesday. The three missiles were discovered by chance when the Iraqi security forces captured former Baath party official Khoder al-Douri who revealed during interrogation the location of the missiles saying they carried nuclear heads," the sources said. They pointed out that the missiles were actually discovered in the trenches lying under six meters of concrete and designed in a way to unable sophisticated sensors from discovering nuclear radiation. The sources said al-Douri, who is related to former Vice Chairman of the Iraq Revolution Council and Saddam's right-hand man Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, was captured after Iraqi police intercepted an e-mail message in which he set a meeting with another former Baath official. The report could not be authenticated by the interior ministry or the national security department, but the paper noted Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiar Zibari made a surprise request recently to Mohammed el-Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to resume inspections for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq"   We'll see how long  it takes for this story to be covered up and forgotten by Big Media.  Can't let a story that proves Bush was right go on for too long, now can they.    Credit:   urlLink Washington Times      WICTORY WEDNESDAY   It's that time again.  Wictory Wednesday.

       WHAT'S HE TRYING TO HIDE?   Former Clinton national security adviser, Sandy Berger, is under investigation after he removed classified documents from the National Archives while preparing to appear before the 9/11 commission.  After he was told by the Archives that some documents were missing he immediately returned them.   "I immediately returned everything I had, except for a few documents that apparently I had accidentally discarded"   Whoa, wait a second.  He threw away documents that he wasn't supposed to have?  Dems and Big Media flipped out when a name is blackened out of Bush's service records, why aren't they doing the same here?  With this new report out that states "Bubba" was told ahead of time that al-Queada wanted to hijack airplanes and smash them into the WTC, and now this, I smell cover up.  But it gets just a little better.  It seems the tool of the Democratic party, The New York Slimes, buried this story on page A16.  Not the front page like they would have done if Condoleezza Rice had done the same thing, but rather in a seven paragraph wire story.    All The News That's Fit To Hide .

       BABY FARMS   I wanted to make a quick post about all this talk about cloning humans and stem cell research.  I'm against this.  All it is is creating life just to kill it.  Remember that scene in  The Matrix  where Neo's shown the fields of humans being grown just so the machines can use them as an energy supply, only to be discarded when they are no longer useful?  That's what this is like.  Creating a human life just so some mad scientist can get what they want from them and then throw the rest away.  It's inhuman.  And we don't even know if human stem cells will be able to cure anything anyway.  This may be mass genocide for nothing. I read somewhere that scientist are working on alternative methods of what people think stem cells may accomplish.  And before you go on a rampage, it wasn't NewsMax or any other Right-Wing magazine, it was some scientific magazine.  This is what government funding needs to be used for, not for turning      into        The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       NEW LINK   I've added a new link in the Bugs & Other Stuff section.  Everyone visit the site.    FREEDOM OF SPEECH?   I did a post once on the group called Protest Warriors.  For those who don't know, Protest Warrior is a group of Conservatives who go to anti-freedom protests to try and balance them out with some Right Minded views.  They're met with huge amounts of hostility and hatred from the Left-Winger anti-freedom protesters.  Nazi and fascist seem to be the most popular names to call them.  Anti-freedom protesters have tried to censor Protest Warrior at the rallies, but police refuse to do anything about it.    I tell you, these Left-Wing nuts love to hold up the Constitution and scream "FIRST AMENDMENT" every chance they get, but when someone they hate uses the same first amendment give their views they cry fowl.  I love it.   Credit:   urlLink Fox News      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

But it's not only the lies of  Fahrenheit 911 . It also has articles by both Conservative and Liberal writers trying to get the facts out.

       ANOTHER VICTORY FOR THE VR-WC   We, the VR-WC, hate it when someone attacks our president.  When that happens, there's no ends we won't go to to silence them.  Ask Howard Stern and now Whoopi Goldberg.  We have our fingers in over 90% of the companies in America, and Slim-Fast is one of them.  Thanks to our threats, Slim-Fast has dropped Ms. Goldberg.    On a serious note.  The hate-filled Left needs to understand that there's consequences to their actions.  They have every right to say what they want, but we as Americans also have the right to let our feelings be known about what they say or do.  What gets me is the double standard here.  If Ted Nugent were to get up during a Bush fundraiser and just rip   urlLink Candidate Waffles   and   urlLink "Baby Face" Edwards   apart like Goldberg did Bush, and he wouldn't distance himself from it like Kerry has yet to do, Big Media would be screaming bloody murder and demanding that  Bush  apologize.

       COMPROMISE   Well, Republicans failed to get the necessary number of votes on the measure to ban same sex marriage.  So, it doesn't look like this is going to pass any time soon.  Let me give you a little info about my feelings on this.  I think there should be an amendment to the Constitution.  Now before you get all huffy and give me the "the Constitution is a sacred document that we shouldn't be changing", it's not like it would be the first amendment added.  Unless I'm totally reading   urlLink this  , which I probably am, there have been 17 amendments added since 1791.  Anyway, back to the compromise.  Compromising puts a bad taste in my mouth.  I hate it.  But, as I can see this will never pass, I guess I'm going to have to settle with each state voting for or against it.  As long as states who vote against it aren't forced to recognize same sex marriages.     SHOWCASE   I thought I would showcase my favorite "artwork" that I've done.  Some of the newer readers may have never seen some of these, unless they've went through the archives.  Now, they aren't necessarily the best, they're just my favorite.  Enjoy.

We've all seen how Big Media loves John Edwards' southern accent.  They swoon for it and praise it when ever he talks.  But why is it when a southern Republican speaks, it's cause for ridicule?  They slam us as rednecks, hicks and backwoods hillbillies.  Yet   urlLink "Baby Face" Edwards   is called smooth.  Jealousy?  Not so much jealousy as it is anger.

       DOES THIS SURPRISE ANYONE?   Extreme Left-Wing nuts are planning to try and basically shutdown the Republican National Convention with acts that could be described as acts of terror.  They're planning on trying to fool bomb sniffing dogs by hiding gunpowder and tablets laced with ammonium nitrate.  They're hoping that this will temporarily shutdown trains and maybe even cause an evacuation of MSG.  These Left-Wing terrorists are using the internet to spread their message.  Read some of the things they want people to do.   ""Go to a rifle, pistol or skeet shooting range, spend an hour shooting to saturate clothing with smell of gunpowder, go directly to a New Jersey Transit, LIRR or subway train headed for Penn Station.   "Try to have at least two people on a train in different locations, sit or stand near the doors as the train approaches the station, try to get near police and dogs, loiter as long as possible around the dog, try to pet it if possible.   "If the dog alerts on your scent, do not leave or resist; the situation will cause a major disruption of the train schedule. ... If there is more than one person on the train that causes a dog to alert, you can bet that the train will not be going anywhere for a long time ... neither will any trains behind it.   "It is important that the police call in all possible resources to investigate the situation. ... This will result in the maximum disruption. ... With any luck, Madison Square Garden will be evacuated.   "Rush hours are ideal, the final night of the convention, very good, too."   Like I said, does this surprise anyone?  This is what the hate-filled Left has become.  They're all for free speech, as long as it's their free speech.  I hope these bomb sniffing dogs have been taught to bite.

       TALK ABOUT STATING THE OBVIOUS     urlLink Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism   is a documentary that's setting out to expose the truth about Fox News.  That it leans to the Right.  Uh, Duh.  Everyone knows it leans to the Right.   "What we found is not that Fox is a conservative network, but that it's a network that follows the party line of the Bush administration"   Same old Liberal talking point about Fox News being a puppet of the Bush Administration.  The same Fox News that has shown the trailer for  Lienheit 911  more times in one day than I can count, has people on there that just rip Bush apart, disagree with everything Bush says or does or believes.  Yeah, they're his puppet alright.  It's hard being the big dog on the block.  There's Fox News, the St. Bernard, sitting on top and they have these little Chihuahuas always running up and nipping at their feet then running away.  Jealousy, that's all it is.    DOESN'T MATTER   Al Franken is   urlLink changing the name of his show  .  He went through a couple of names that didn't' work.  "The O'Limbaugh Factor" and "The O'President Bush Factor" before settling on this masterpiece, "The Al Franken Show".  He could change the name to "The Radio Factor", it wouldn't matter.  It's not the name, it's who's hosting it and the message he's spewing forth.  Sane people don't want to listen to a madman on the radio.  The whole network can change it's name, it'll still go under.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       DAMNED IF HE DOES AND DAMNED IF HE DOESN'T   Members of the NAACP are bashing Bush for declining to speak to the organization.  Next Thursday,   urlLink Candidate Waffles   will address the group.  I can't wait to see how Kerry's going to call Bush a racist for turning them down.  I think he made the right decision for two reasons.  1) If Bush were to address the NAACP, the Left would say he's only doing it because he feels he should and that he really doesn't want to be there and 2) Why should he set himself up for Big Media to use footage of him being booed over and over and over again.  Him addressing the NAACP wouldn't have made any more blacks vote for him than had already planned to.  The leadership of the NAACP hates him, and he's not too fond of them either.  So why go there and be bombarded with hate.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

"They've sent a video to the media claiming responsibility." "Okay, get me the U.N. on the phone.  We need to figure out what happened." "Sir.  Figure out what happened?  I just told you." "I don't want to take any chances.  We're going to have to talk things out for a couple of months." "Sir, we don't have a couple of months.  We need to strike back, now." "Look, we need the U.N.'s permission to strike back.  We can't just go out and defend ourselves without their consent."  Meanwhile, al-Queda's recruiting homicide bombers to attack us on the streets and we become another Israel.  This could be an actual event should The Toilet Twins win in four months.  Kind of scares the crap out of you, doesn't it.    CHENEY -VS- EDWARDS   The battle lines have been drawn.  It will be VP Dick Cheney debating John Edwards.  Lets see the tale of the tape.    Edwards: -Has yet to finish one term in office -In his five years in the Senate, he has yet to author a piece of legislation that even made it to the Senate floor for a vote -Since 1991, Edwards has only voted in 9 out of the 18 elections in his home county, citing the fact that he was just too busy -Never had a job that would be considered hard work, even though he claims to be a man for the "blue-collar" worker, except at a UPS loading dock for six months -Has never held an executive position, and at one point had no idea who Yitzhak Rabin was  Cheney: -Advisor to President Nixon -Chief of Staff to President Ford -US Representative, including leadership – 10 years -Secretary of Defense during the Gulf War -Incumbent Vice President  Need I say more?  Dick Cheney will wipe the floor with   urlLink "Baby Face" Edwards  , but will lose the debate.  Big Media will swoon all over Edwards southern accent and charm and will declare him the winner.

       MICHAEL MOORE, THE GENIUS?   As much as I hate the man, I have to admit he is pretty damn smart.  We all know Moore keeps his lawyers on speed dial in case someone says something about him he doesn't like, so why hasn't he attacked   urlLink Mike Wilson   yet?  Because he doesn't want any more media attention brought to Wilson's film.  Moore knows how to play the media better than anyone.  He knows how to pull the strings and create false events.  Look at the whole Disney/Miramax thing.  That's why he refuses to talk about this film or to Wilson.  Moore knows the power of controversy.  I'm going to make a prediction right now.  Michael Moore Hates America will make, in total, around $25 million.  Not bad for a documentary, but no where near Lienheit 911's money.  But if, for some reason, Moore looses his cool and slams Wilson in the media, that total will rise by at least another $10 million.  I would love to hear your predictions on what you think this movie will make.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       JOE WILSON A LIAR   Joe Wilson, the man who accused the White House of leaking the name of his wife to Robert Novak, and who was also the man the CIA used to find out if Iraq was trying to acquire yellowcake uranium from Africa, said that his findings would lay to rest any notion that Iraq sought uranium there and has said his findings were ignored by the White House.  This is lie number one.  The Senate intelligence committee report that came out yesterday debunked Wilson's claims and found that his report bolstered the case for most intelligence analysts.  So, wait a minute, the White House was right?  Wow, who would have guessed?  Oh, that's right, Right-Minded people knew.  Here's lie number two.  Wilson also claimed that his wife, CIA employee Wilson claims was outed by the White House, did not recommend him for the yellowcake mission.  But that turns out to be a lie as well, because the Senate report points out that Wilson's wife did recommend him for the job.  Lie after lie after lie.  Does anyone know if Wilson is a hold on from the Clinton Administration?

That could be Kerry's next flip-flop.    urlLink Candidate Waffles   now wants to let people with AIDS immigrate to America.  A ban that he   urlLink supported   in '93.  As if we don't already have a strain on our healthcare system from people who are legal, now Kerry wants us to spend even more money, that we don't have, on illegals.  Damn.

       ANOTHER VICTORY FOR TERROR   The Filipino Government has capitulated to the terrorists.  "Iraqi militants", or terrorists, were holding Filipino Angelo dela Cruz hostage and were demanding that the Philippines pull their peace keeping troops out of Iraq.  They agreed.  They will begin to pull their troops out in August.  As a result of their surrender, the terrorists have released dela Cruz.  Which is the only good news out of all this.  Wow, that's two victories. Spain and the Philippines, they're on a roll.  But seriously, this is the absolute wrong thing to do.  They see that these threats can work, and that's what keeps them going.    THE MORAL OF THE STORY   I loved this.  Enjoy.   "Once upon a time, on a farm in Texas, there was a little red hen who scratched about the barnyard until she uncovered quite a few grains of wheat. She called all of her neighbors together and said, "If we plant this wheat, we shall have bread to eat. Who will help me plant it?" "Not I," said the cow. "Not I," said the duck. "Not I," said the pig. "Not I," said the goose. "Then I will do it by myself," said the little red hen. And so she did. The wheat grew very tall and ripened into golden grain. "Who will help me reap my wheat?" asked the little red hen. "Not I," said the duck. "Out of my classification," said the pig. "I'd lose my seniority," said the cow. "I'd lose my unemployment compensation," said the goose. "Then I will do it by myself," said the little red hen, and so she did. At last it came ti me to bake the bread. "Who will help me bake the bread?" asked the little red hen. "That would be overtime for me," said the cow. "I'd lose my welfare benefits," said the duck. "I'm a drop out and never learned how," said the pig. "If I'm to be the only helper, that's discrimination," said the goose. "Then I will do it by myself," said the little red hen. She baked five loaves and held them up for all of her neighbors to see. They wanted some and, in fact, demanded a share. But the little red hen said, "No, I shall eat all five loaves." "Excess profits!" cried the cow. "Capitalist leech!" screamed the duck. "I demand equal rights!" yelled the goose. The pig just grunted in disdain. And they all painted "Unfair!" picket signs and marched around and around the little red hen, shouting obscenities. Then a government agent came. He said to the little red hen, "You must not be so greedy." " But I earned the bread," said the little red hen. "Exactly," said the agent. "That is what makes our free enterprise system so wonderful. Anyone in the barnyard can earn as much as he wants. But under our modern government regulations, the productive workers must divide the fruits of their labor with those who are lazy and idle." And they all lived happily ever after, including the little red hen, who smiled and clucked, "I am grateful, for now I truly understand." But her neighbors became quite disappointed in her. She never again baked bread because she joined the "party" and got her bread free, at someone else's expense. And all the Democrats smiled. 'Fairness' had been established. Individual initiative had died but nobody noticed; perhaps no one cared, as long as there was free bread"     Credit:   urlLink Claudia      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       THE SOURCE OF A MANS POWER        There are many things a man will fight for.  His country, his woman and his kids.  But the television remote control is the most important thing to a man.  Don't believe me.  Try taking it away from a man one time.  We'll beat you within in an inch of your life to get it back.  Because he who rules the remote, welds the power.  The remote control is the object that takes the commercials way and brings us our wrestling, football, Fox News and late night softcore porn on HBO Friday and Saturday nights.  Not that I watch that kind of stuff.  Ladies, watch your man one night while he's watching t.v.  During the show, he won't lay the remote down.  He'll continue to hold it, all be it unknowingly so.  He is unconsciously protecting it.  The remote is like the ring in the Lord Of The Rings.  It weaves it's power over us and, ironically, controls us.  Why am I ranting on about a t.v. remote?  Because I'm bored.  But, am I lying men?    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       IS THIS BIASED?   I was wondering if someone could tell me if this is biased reporting.  Big Media is all over the the Senate report released today about pre-war intelligence, but has largely ignored the Useless Nations report the Saddam had WMD's and had shipped them to Syria before and during the invasion.  Why is this?  This couldn't be because of they're Left leaning hatet of Bush could it?  And why is FoxNews the news outlet covering the Oil For Food scandal?  It couldn't be because it makes the Useless Nations look bad, could it?    KERRY'S FRIENDS   We've all heard about the Radio City Music Hall hatefest yesterday where the Toilet Twins were sung the praises of the Hollywood Lefties.  We also know about Whoopi Goldberg's tirade about Bush's last name.    urlLink Candidate Waffles   is refusing to release the tape of the event.  Why?  Doesn't he want the America people to know what kind of people he claims to be "the heart and soul of America" really are?  I don't know about you, but the people I call the heart and soul of America don't compare George W. Bush to a vagina.  But that's just me.

       NEW BLOG   I've added a new blog for you all to enjoy.  Army Of One.  Great site.  Go check it out.  One quick thing.  There's a test on the site that will tell you if you're a   urlLink Neocon   or not.  I took the test and found out I'm a   Neoconservative…  -Want the US to be the world's unchallenged superpower  -unwavering support for Israel  -Support American unilateral action  -Support preemptive strikes to remove perceived threats to US security  -Promote the development of an American empire  -Equate American power with the potential for world peace  -Seek to democratize the Arab world  -Push regime change in states deemed threats to the US or its allies  -Historical neoconservative: President Teddy Roosevelt -Modern neoconservative: President Ronald Reagan  So for all the Lefties out there who think I'm a NeoCon, here's the proof.    CAMPAIGN VIDEO GAME   Get a load of   urlLink this  .  You'll need WMP to play it and you'll have to go through a story about internet gambling in internet cafes before you get to the story.  There's a computer game coming out where you'll be able to run the campaign of either Bush or Kerry, or any other candidate throughout time.  Or you can make yourself a candidate and run against someone online.  This sounds pretty cool.  I may have to get this, if the online play is free that is.

       WAFFLES -VS- "BABY FACE"   Ladies and Gentlemen.  The following bout has a 45 minute time limit and is for the undisputed World Hypocrisy Championship of the world.  In this corner, wearing the blue and yellow camo, standing 7'8", weighing in at 268 pounds, hailing from Boston, Mass, John   urlLink "Candidate Waffles"   Kerry.   "In the Senate four years, and that is the full extent of public life, no international experience, no military experience. You can imagine what the advertising is going to be next year.  When I came back from Vietnam in 1969 I don't know if John Edwards was out of diapers then. Well, I'm sure he was out of diapers"      "I think the American people want an experienced hand at the helm of state, this is not the time for on-the-job training in the White House on national security issues"      "Edwards says heÂs the only one who can win states in the South. He can't win his own state"      "Below is John Edwards MAJOR economic address, where he promises to reward work and to create opportunity. There's one thing missing from this speech: TRADE. Apparently, cracking down on unfair trade practices and promoting fair and balanced trade was not a priority to John Edwards just eight months ago. Mr. Johnny Come Lately on Trade"      "If his intent is to remove special interests from Washington, why has he, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, taken more than $11 million from lawyers and law firms?"    And his opponent.  Wearing the blue with black trim, standing 6'3, weighing in at 230 pounds, hailing from  Seneca, South Carolina, John   urlLink "Baby Face" Edwards  .   "Do you believe that change is more likely to be brought about by someone who has spent 20 years in Washington or by someone who is more of an outsider to this process?"      "In order to beat Bush, we need a nominee who can win Southern states, not another New Englander or Washington insider who loses every Southern state"      "I myself have been against NAFTA because of the damage it's doing to our economy, against the other trade agreements that I don't believe incorporate fair trade elements that need to be there. That's the difference between Senator Kerry and myself. And I think these differences will become clearer and clearer as the race focuses on the two of us"      "If we want real change in America, real change in Washington, itÂs my belief that it takes somebody that's not a Washington insider to do that"      "In 1969, I was sitting around a kitchen table with my parents trying to figure out how we would pay for college like so many Iowans do every single day. And that is a difference between me and Senator Kerry"    Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this has been a very brutal fight.  There's teeth and blood everywhere.  Wait a minute, something's happening.  It looks like the two rivals are hugging in the middle of the right.  It seems "Baby Face" is raising the hand of "Waffles".  Ladies and Gentlemen, it looks like these two once bitter rivals have joined together to form a tag team.  Wait, "Waffles" and "Baby Face" are taking the mic.   "Bush Is Evil"    There you have it ladies and gentlemen.  The newly formed team of Kerry and Edwards who are now calling themselves "New America".  Me personally, I like America just the way it is.   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       HOW CUTE       Here's a question.  How do you think it'll be before   urlLink Candidate Waffles   and   urlLink "Baby Face" Edwards   begin pimping these kids to the American public?    JOHN EDWARDS   I thought I would give my feelings on Sen. John Edwards.  I want to dislike the man.  I really do, but I can't.  As much as I hate to admit it, he is charming.  I think Kerry made the right choice.  The only things I can dislike Edwards on is that he's a Democrat and a lawyer.  Now granted, contrary to what Dems are saying, good looks, charm and a southern accent won't win this election for Kerry/Edwards but it won't hurt them either.  The Right's argument is that Edwards is too green to be that close to becoming president.  The Left's argument is that come Nov., Edwards will have been a Senator the same amount of time Bush was Gov. of Texas.  Both are right, but, not surprisingly, I have to side with the Right on this one.  Being Gov. of the second biggest state in the union comes with a lot more experience with big issues than being the Sen. of South Carolina.    COULD THIS HURT?   Remember the broo-ha-ha when a Boston Globe reporter Bush to name 5 leaders of third-world countries, and he couldn't do it?  Well, it seem that Edwards isn't too much for name either.  Last year, the Washington Monthly reported that one of Edwards advance man suggested they ought to go to the reception for Leah Rabin.  Edwards asked  who that she was.  He was told that she was the widow of the late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.  He then asked who he was.  My question is when will Big Media pick up on this story?  My answer is never.  Kerry has too a chance to beat Bush, Big Media doesn't want to do anything to spoil that.   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      WICTORY WEDNESDAY   It's that time again.  Wictory Wednesday.

I really don't have anything negative to say about Edwards yet, as I don't know much about him.  But I'm sure that'll change in the next month or two.  But I can tell you all this.  If this country elects the two Johns, that's where this country will be.  In the john.  Hey, that could be their campaign slogan.   Put The Country In The John With The Johns.   And the title has nothing to do with johns.  That was unintentional.    WHAT?   Did anyone know about this.     "Kidnapped US marine Wassef Ali Hassoun has been taken to "a place of safety"  after he pledged not to return to the US military , his captors told al-Jazeera television in a statement yesterday"   I didn't know he was a deserter.

       WAR TIME PRESIDENT   First, I hope everyone had a great 4th.  And for all you America hating Lefties, I'm sure it was a nightmare.  Anyway, here's a question for you.  One of the biggest things I hear about Kerry is that he's more qualified to handle the War On Terror because he saw action in Vietnam.  That since Bush didn't, he doesn't have the qualification.  Here's my question.  Does the same apply to "Bubba"?  He was never even in the military.  Was he qualified order troops into Somalia or the bombing of Afghanistan?  The Left seem to think so, but don't seem to think Bush should have sent troops to Evanston or Iraq.  Does anyone else smell the Hypocrisy and Double Standard in the room?    THE CORNERSTONE OF FREEDOM       The cornerstone for the new Freedom Tower was layed yesterday.  One question.  Why are they going to cover this thing up?  You'd think they'd want it to be seen by everyone who passes the building.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       AMERICAN FREEDOM       Wow, 228 years old and still looking good.  She doesn't show her age at all, does she?  Why, I remember when she was 212 like it was only yesterday.  Anyway, what ever you do today, have fun and stay safe.  I think I'll close this post with the lyrics to my favorite song about my favorite country.  Enjoy.   "If tomorrow all the things were gone I’d worked for all my life, And I had to start again with just my children and my wife. I’d thank my lucky stars to be living here today, ‘Cause the flag still stands for freedom and they can’t take that away.  And I’m proud to be an American where at least I know I’m free. And I won’t forget the men who died, who gave that right to me. And I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today. ‘Cause there ain’t no doubt I love this land God bless the U.S.A.  From the lakes of Minnesota, to the hills of Tennessee, across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea,  From Detroit down to Houston and New York to LA, Well, there’s pride in every American heart, and it’s time to stand and say:  I’m proud to be an American where at least I know I’m free. And I won’t forget the men who died, who gave that right to me. And I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today. ‘Cause there ain’t no doubt I love this land God bless the U.S.A."

       NEW "ARTWORK": NEW POSTER       Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, a Hezbollah leader, says:   "Praise Allah for Michael Moore.  He sees the world the way we do.  Mr. Moore shows who the real enemy is.  Not us peace loving, non-murdering Muslims.  But rather the ugly, jingoistic hate mongers, the Americans.  I urge every terro... I mean ever minute man to go see this fabulous piece of work."

Not since the film  How To Suppress Freedom In One Easy Step  has a movie moved me so.  Fahrenheit 911  will now be required viewing material for every school child in China."     One last thing.

       THE PEACE LOVING LEFT   I love   urlLink Moorewatch  .  One of the best sites on the net, but I really love reading their hate mail.  Some of the stuff from the peace loving, golden hearted left is pretty creative.  So I thought I would share some of my favorite Moorewatch hate mail with you.  I hope Lee and JimK won't mind.  These are just parts of the letter, I'm not going to post the entire thing.  Enjoy.   "Im moving to Canada and getting out of this power hungry country. An example of stupid laws is, when I was 18 I went to poleman (I donÂt know if thatÂs spelled Wright) Washington to my friends dorm room. If you walk outside into the neighborhood there are hundreds of teens running around drunk, searching for the next party. Meanwhile cops are just standing around. So here me and my friends are sitting in the dormroom smoking some pot because we hate being drunk, being perfectly quiet. Well we get a knock at the door to find 6 cops. In the end I had 100 hours of community service. It was insane. These cops had nothing better to do but bully us. We werenÂt the out of control drunks running around, we were just sitting peacefully in our room watching TV. This is an example of a fucked up government!!!!!"   How dare those fascist pigs bust them for smoking pot.  This is from someone in England, I'm guessing.   "YOU WANKERS SUPPORT GW POES, THUS YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN NAZI GERMANY. YOU DONT REPECT THE LAWS OF WAR, YOU DONT RESPECT THE SOVERENTY OF ANOTHER COUNTRY, BET YOU DONT RESPECT THE BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING EITHER, YOUR IDEALIST METHODS CRY OUT TO BE BLOWN UP. fUCK YOU WANKERS AT MOOREWATCH, FUCK YOU NAZI BASTERDS AT MOOREWATCH, MOOREWATCH IS SOUND MORE LIKE GURBLES THESE DAYS AND MOORE IS SOUNDING LIKE WINSTON CHURCHILL, USA IS EVIL, FUCKING WANKERS. OH BTW LET YOU IN ON A SECRET THE CIA FLEW THE PLANES INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE."   The CIA recruited Muslims to fly the planes into the WTC.  Wow.  This one guy has made me change my mind about America.     "Fuck you little prick. IÂm assuming youÂre a brainwashed, midget, ugly little fear-laden wimp, like all the other pussy-ass right-wingers I know."   Wow, that 8th grade education at work right there.  And finally, my favorite letter from a Lefty who thinks everybody is equal and preaches no war and free love.   "And by  the way, I hope Regan suffered.....he deserved it.  Wishing you a swift execution"   Kumbaya my Lord, Kumbaya.  O Lord, Kumbaya.  Yeah, the Left is the party of understanding and love.  I'm not sure how many of my readers where alive when Kennedy was murdered, but did any Right-Winger say "I hope Kennedy suffered when he got half of his head blown off...he deserved it"?  That's the difference between the Left and Right.  We have more respect for people than to say something like that.  That's what the Left has become over the years.  A party of hate and intolerance.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       OH DEAR GOD   I just don't know what to think about this.  Members, it doesn't say who, but we all know it's the Dems, of the House what the U.N. brought to America to oversee the elections this Nov.  They're still harping on the 2000 election where Al "Insane Freak" Gore lost to W.  Four years and they still can't get over it.  *shakes head in sadness*   "As lawmakers, we must assure the people of America that our nation will not experience the nightmare of the 2000 presidential election"   said on anonymous Dem.  This is pathetic, Democrats don't seem to think people are smart enough to be able to vote for themselves.  Apparently, we need a babysitter.   Credit:   urlLink Yahoo!

       NADER AND THE DEMS   I have a question.  Why are the Dems so scared of Ralph Nader?  Every time his name is mentioned, Dems go into convolutions and begin to sweat.  Don't they believe in a free America?  Don't they think he has every right to run for president?  That's what makes this the greatest country on Earth.  Everyone has a right to spread their message to the public.  But Dems don't see it that way.  At every turn they're trying to censor Nader.  Telling him to drop out.  Lawsuits in Arizona challenging signatures needed to get Nader's name on the ballot.  Threats lawsuits in Florida.  I might not agree with Nader's message, but I support him in getting his name on as many ballots as possible.  Come one, lets face it.  His name on the ballot isn't going to help Bush in the slightest.  What are people so scared of?  Give people a choice.

       REJECTED   Spider-Man 2 opened Wednesday and pulled in a record $40 million shoving Moore's  F911  to number two.  I guess all those people who saw Spider-Man just wanted a little bit more truth in their movie.    TAKING THE WIND OUT OF THEIR SAILS   Contrary to what the record industry tells us, downloading music from the internet doesn't hurt record sales after all.  Record sales are up 7% from this time last year.  I thought downloading music from the internet was supposed to destroy the record industry.  It was supposed to be taking millions out of the multi-millionaires pockets.  Huh, I guess not.   Credit:   urlLink Yahoo!

       THANK YOU   This post is dedicated to the men and woman who have served and are serving in the United States military.  I've never been in the armed forces, so I don't even pretend to know everything you go through or the sacrifices you have made or are making.  But I just wanted to let you know that you have people back home who love, support and respect you and who wish you a safe and speedy return. You sacrifice everything in your lives for people you don't even know.  You may not call yourselves heroes, but that's what you are.      The first of every month, I'll post this message.  This is something that would be great to see take off.  It would be nice to see people honor and thank the men and woman who keep us safe.  What's great about this is that both Democrats and Republicans can participate.  If you would like to take part in this, just copy the bug above and save to your host site.  If you don't have one,   urlLink Photobucket   has a great free host site.  Show your support for the men and woman who defend our freedoms.     THE NEW SADDAM        I told you.  I'm not going back to that jail cell untill the Americans get rid of that camel.  I want my old camel.  Amy was nice and soft.  This new one's too rough in bed."  Saddam Hussein was read his charges today.  Including gassing of the Kurds in 1988, killing members of political parties in the last 30 years and the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.  Too bad they couldn't charge him with everything, but that trial would take a good ten years.  Anyway, seeing him today with his hargard face looking beaten and tired, I felt kind of sorry.  Sorry he's still alive.  The son of a bitch should have been shot coming out of his spider hole.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       CHARLEY   Hurricane Charley has been upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane.  That's 145MPH ground winds.  Damn.  The strongest winds I've ever encountered was maybe around 70MPH, I can't even fathom 145.  One question.

       WHY BUSH IS BETTER   This is why Bush is a better man than John Kerry.  On Larry King yesterday, President Bush said of   urlLink Candidate Waffles  :   "He views it (his service in Vietnam) as honorable service, and so do I"   Even after all the personal attacks by Kerry, Bush still says something like this.  Bush has never attacked Kerry's service record or the lies he's told about his time in Vietnam, unlike Kerry has, and that's one of the many reasons I'll be voting for him this November.

       WARM KICKINGS      You all remember the movie  Cool Runnings .  About the Jamaican bobsled team and their Olympic story.  Well, we may have a new underdog to root for.  The Iraqi soccer team.  They came into Athens with nobody giving them a chance.  They were lucky to even make it to the Olympics.  They just played their preliminary game against heavily favored Portugal, an awesome game I might add, and beat them 4-2.  This is a victory they really earned and deserved.  After everything they've went though by Saddam and Uday this is something they really needed.  It may only be a soccer game to you and me, but to them it's something that could help bring pride back to their country.  I think they have something to prove to the world.  If you would have told me two or three years ago that I would be cheering for Iraq in anything, I would have laughed in your face.  But I would love to see them win any medal.  How awesome would that be?  Even if they don't win another game they showed they have what it takes.  In case anyone care, their next game against either Costa Rica or Morocco will be played Sunday.    AT LEAST THEIR SUPREME COURT KNOWS THE LAW      "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The California Supreme Court on Thursday voided the nearly 4,000 same-sex marriages sanctioned in San Francisco this year and ruled unanimously that the mayor overstepped his authority by issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples.  The court said the city violated the law when it issued the certificates, since both legislation and a voter-approved measure defined marriage as a union between a man and woman."   Finally someone is reading the law books over there.  The people of California voted this down, but Mayor Newsom thought he could interpret the law better.  One small victory.

       WHO SENT US TO WAR?   Just a quick post.  We keep hearing from people like Michael Moore that Bush sent our children to war.  That Bush sent them to Iraq to fight.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the President of the United States need the approval of the U.S. Congress to declare war?  He can't just wake up one day and send American troops into a country to fight.  So, in actuality, didn't Kerry and Edwards "send our children to war"?

       TROUBLE IN PARADISE     urlLink Candidate Waffles   and his sugar mamma had to sleep in separate bedrooms Sunday night after a campaign rally in Arizona.  The two got into a heated argument after the rally and needed a little cooling off time.  Your humble blogger, with the help of the VR-WC, has been able to find out what the argument was about.    Waffles -  But baby, please don't' cut me off.    Sugar Mamma -  I told you John, you've had enough.  Waffles -  I can't survive without it.  Sugar Mamma -  No more.  Waffles -  Fine.  I don't need your stupid money anyway.  Sugar Mamma -  Is that so?  Waffles -  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I do need it.  Sugar Mamma -  Go sleep in the other room tonight, John.  Waffles -  Yes ma'am.    Credit:   urlLink Drudge       GREAT POINT   Lark, a guess poster over at   urlLink StarkTruth  , made a great point in a post yesterday.   "What is with the sudden indignation over a 527 anti-Kerry ad? I certainly don't remember McCain making a stink over all the 527 anti-Bush ads that have been run. If McCain's problem is that he despises attacks on someone's military service record, then why didn't he strongly defend Bush like this every time some liberal moron group carried on saying Bush had been AWOL? I didn't hear Mr. RINO make a big stink over Kerry when he denigrated Bush's service in the National Guard.  Bush has NEVER spoken critically of Kerry's service record. Kerry did cross that line. That didn't seem to bother McCain"   I've lost a lot of respect for McCain over this.     WICTORY WEDNESDAY   It's that time again.  Wictory Wednesday.

       CLASSIC POSTS   There's nothing to post on at this time, so I thought I would go through my archives and re-post a few of my favorite posts from the past.  Some of you have read them, and some either haven't or have forgotten them.  Enjoy.   This first one is probably my all time favorite post.   Feb. 21, 2004  "HISTORY OF THE GOP  Found this site that describes the history of the GOP and I though I would share some of it with you.   The Republican Party was born in the early 1850's by anti-slavery activists and individuals who believed that government should grant western lands to settlers free of charge.    So, what do we learn from this part? Before the Republican Party was founded, there were two main parties. Democrats and Whigs. After the GOP was founded, most Whigs joined up. So that tells us that the Democratic Party was the party of pro-slavery, not the Republican Party. If the Whigs joined the GOP, then the Whigs must have been anti-slavery.   The first official Republican meeting took place on July 6th, 1854 in Jackson, Michigan. The name "Republican" was chosen because it alluded to equality and reminded individuals of Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party.   Now you can make the argument of Jefferson being pro-slavery. You can do it if you want, but he also was instrumental in establishing the freedoms we now have.   In 1856, the Republicans became a national party when John C. Fremont was nominated for President under the slogan: "Free soil, free labor, free speech, free men, Fremont." Even though they were considered a "third party" because the Democrats and Whigs represented the two-party system at the time, Fremont received 33% of the vote. Four years later, Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican to win the White House.   33% right out of the gate. Kind of reminds me of what's happening today with Nader. The Green Party is considered a "third party" and they have every right to become a player in presidential elections. Just don't tell the DNC that. Abe Lincoln was our first Republican president. He was one of the key supporters of abolishing slavery.   The Republicans of the day worked to pass the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery, the Fourteenth, which guaranteed equal protection under the laws, and the Fifteenth, which helped secure voting rights for African-Americans.   Outlaw slavery, equal protection under the law and voting rights for blacks. Boy, if you listen to the world today the Republican Party is the party that's trying to hold the black man down. Proof has nothing to do with history evidently.   In 1896, Republicans were the first major party to favor women's suffrage. When the 19th Amendment finally was added to the Constitution, 26 of 36 state legislatures that had voted to ratify it were under Republican control. The first woman elected to Congress was a Republican, Jeanette Rankin from Montana in 1917.   Wow, Republicans were also instrumental in women's rights. Plus the very first woman elected to Congress was a Republican. Kind of dampens the image the Democrats portray us as being, doesn't it.  Abolishing slavery. Free speech. Women's suffrage. In today's stereotypes, none of these sounds like a typical Republican issue, yet they are stances the Republican Party, in opposition to the Democratic Party, adopted early on.  It seems the Democratic Party was lead kicking and screaming into the 20th century, not the GOP.  The GOP, Grand Old Party. Now you know our history, your history. Go out and spread the word. Let the world know you're proud to be Republican. The party of anti-slavery and pro women's rights."    This next post is perfect for all those Lefties out there screaming their heads off about people questioning Kerry.   Feb. 27, 2004   "MY ENVIRONMENT MADE ME DO IT  I had to "steal" this post from Claudia. I don't think I've read many things more true than this.   What makes a hero  Benedict Arnold was a war hero, wounded in battle -- before he turned against his country. Hitler was likewise a decorated and wounded veteran of the First World War. Being a war hero is not a lifetime "get out of jail free" card, exempting you from responsibility for what you do thereafter.  -Thomas Sowell   That says it perfectly. Great find."    This next on has to be the funniest damn thing I have ever read.   Nov. 22, 2003 " SHOOTING AT A KKK RALLY  The following is from the AP. It's the funniest damn thing I've ever heard of. Enjoy.   JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. - A bullet fired in the air during a Ku Klux Klan initiation ceremony came down and struck a participant in the head, critically injuring him, authorities said.  Gregory Allen Freeman, 45, was charged with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment in the Saturday night incident that wounded Jeffery S. Murr, 24.  About 10 people, including two children, had gathered for the ceremony. The man who was being initiated was blindfolded, tied with a noose to a tree and shot with paintball guns as Freeman fired a pistol in the air to provide the sound of real gunfire, Sheriff Fred Phillips said.  A bullet struck Murr on the top of the head and exited at the bottom of his skull, authorities said.  Freeman fled the ceremony but was arrested near his home, authorities said. He was released on $7,500 bail .   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Poetic Justice."    And finally, the Pledge Of Allegiance.   Nov. 19, 2003 " THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE  I came across this while online and I thought I would share it with you. Comic legend Red Skeleton wrote this piece some years ago. Story has it that one of his teachers in school explained the words and the meaning of the Pledge Of Allegiance to his class. Skeleton later wrote and recorded his recollection of the lecture. Enjoy.   I  - - Me; an individual; a committee of one.  Pledge  - - Dedicate all of my worldly goods to give without self-pity.  Allegiance  - - My love and my devotion.  To the Flag  - - Our standard; Old Glory ; a symbol of Freedom; wherever she waves there is respect, because your loyalty has given her a dignity that shouts, Freedom is everybody's job.  Of the United  - - That means that we have all come together.  States of America  - - Individual communities that have united into forty-eight great states. Forty-eight individual communities with pride and dignity and purpose. All divided with imaginary boundaries, yet united to a common purpose, and that is love for country.  And to the Republic  - - Republic--a state in which sovereign power is invested in representatives chosen by the people to govern. And government is the people; and it's from the people to the leaders, not from the leaders to the people.  For which it stands, One Nation  - - One Nation--meaning, so blessed by God.  Indivisible  - - Incapable of being divided.  With Liberty  - - Which is Freedom; the right of power to live one's own life, without threats, fear, or some sort of retaliation.  And Justice  - - The principle, or qualities, of dealing fairly with others. For All - -  For All --which means, boys and girls, it's as much your country as it is mine. And now, boys and girls, let me hear you recite the Pledge of Allegiance:  I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic, for which it stands; one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.   You may notice that 'Under God' isn't in there. This was done before 'Under God' was put into the Pledge Of Allegiance, which recently people have been getting their panties in a bunch over. It's there, deal with it. It's being there doesn't hurt anyone. Calm down. If you don't want to say 'Under God', then don't."   That's the post that prompted me to put the pledge on the blog for all to read and enjoy.  I hope you enjoyed either reading for the first time or re-reading these posts.

       YOUR DREAM JOB   Just a question for you all.  If you could have your dream job what would it be?  You have no worries about danger or money or anything, what would you want to be.  Myself, I want to be a professional beach bum.  Just like in Jimmy Buffets  Margaritaville .  I want to move to Hawaii and live in a little shack on the beach.  Do nothing but hang out in the ocean or my hammock and collect sea shells all day.  Drive a little Moped where ever I go.  Soak up the sun.  Don't have to get up until afternoon if I choose.  I can't think of anything better.  There's times when I just want to jump on a plane and do it.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       JOHN KERRY, THE MICHAEL MOORE OF POLITICS   We all know that John Kerry was in Vietnam.  Oh yeah, he was there.  And we all know how Moore likes to create stories for his mocumentaries.  Well, it seems that   urlLink Candidate Waffles   likes to make up stories as well.  Kerry's been claiming for years that he was illegally sent into Cabodia on Christmas of '68.  Turns out that may be a bold face lie.  Here's the story Kerry likes to tell.   "I remember Christmas of 1968 sitting on a gunboat in Cambodia. I remember what it was like to be shot at by the Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge and Cambodians, and have the president of the United States telling the American people that I was not there; the troops were not in Cambodia. I have that memory which is seared--seared--in me"   John O'Neil, co-author of  Unfit For Command  and the Swift Boat commander who took over Kerry's boat says that Kerry was never in Cambodia during Christmas or at anytime during the war.  All the living commanders in Kerry's chain of command deny that Kerry was ever ordered to Cambodia.  Three of the five crewmen on Kerry's boat deny that they or their boat were ever in Cambodia.  Kerry himself even changed the story for his book  Tour of Duty .  In his book, Kerry writes about a mortar attack that occurred on Christmas Eve 1968 near the Cambodian border in a town called Sa Dec and Christmas day was spent at the base writing entries in his journal.  Another Flip-Flop, or Kerryism as some have taken to calling them.  This man has a 30 year history of lies and spin to make himself seem the hero or the only good guy out there.  John Forbes Kerry.  JFK.  Just For Kerry.  Because that's who he's out for.   Credit:   urlLink Drudge      ALAN KEYES FOR SENATE?   Why is he running?  For one, he hasn't a snowballs chance in hell of winning.  And second, he's not even from Illinois.  He lives in Maryland.  I guess he's moving it Illiois so he can run.  Just like Hillary Clinton moving to NY to run.  My feeling is you shouldn't be allowed to run for office of a state unless you have lived there at least 5 years.    KERRY HATES KIDS   We already know that on 9/11 Kerry would have walked out on school kids scaring them, now it turns out he's to busy to even wave to kids with Cancer.   "The Kerry Edwards campaign disappointed dozens of children suffering with Cancer on Sunday when the candidates' whistlestop train tour failed to stop and greet them while traveling through a ranch where they were vacationing in New Mexico.  'The train tracks run for four miles through the ranch,' complained radio host Don Imus, who runs the Imus Ranch for the kids - some of them terminally ill - near Santa Fe, New Mexico."     I guess   urlLink Candidate Waffles   and   urlLink "Baby Face" Edwards   were just to busy for talk with some sick kids.  Maybe coming up with ways to blame Bush for their Cancer.

       NOW THAT'S HARSH      "Iraq's interim government has reinstated capital punishment in its bloody battle against insurgents.  The penalty will be meted out to those guilty of murder, endangering national security  and drug dealing "   That's what we need to do here.  Not the death penalty, but stop funning about with drugs.  A minimum of 40 years in prison with no parole for drug dealers.  Right now we soft shoe around with drugs.  Giving them maybe a year or two for possession and maybe 5-7 for dealing.  The government needs to get tough.

       SECOND TIME   I got another coward leaving a comment without an e-mail address.  That makes two.  Just like a Dem to throw a bomb and run.  This isn't D.O.D by any chance, is it?  Get a load of this from the KERRY TRIED TO RUN post.   "McCain is a true American. George W Bush and you "Kerry Haters" are only interest in this election because you think you will be wealthier if Bush wins. You could give a rat's behind about the young men and women risking their lives in Iraq so that your precious stock portfolio will rise.  "Kerry Haters" How preschool is that! You can't handle the integrity of John McCain. A loose canon you call him, you make him sound like commodity. Your boy, your puppet George Bush well he Aims right where you tell him to."   Let me break this down and answer it.    Yes, John McCain is a true American.  He was captured by the Vietcong and help as a POW, but yet doesn't feel the need to use it for political gain.  Kerry could learn something from McCain.    I'm only interested in this election because I think Bush will make me wealthier?  Alright, I can move out of the trailer park now.  Sweet.    I could give a rats behind about the men and women risking their lives in Iraq?  I think you all can judge this one for yourselves.    Bush will make my stock portfolio rise?  Dude, I'd better invest in the market then.  Anyone of you other rich Republicans got some money I can borrow.  I'll pay you back with Bush wins and I become rich.  I freely admit it.  I Hate John Kerry.   Back to McCain.  When did I ever talk about McCain.  I like the guy.  He speaks his mind.  Just like Bush was a couple of years ago, McCain doesn't listen to polls.  Too bad Bush has begun to.  I McCain sound like a commodity.  Talk about calling the kettle black.  That's not a racist joke.  Look at Barack Obama at the DNC.  The showed him off like a piece of property.  Bush is my boy?  My puppet?  How does he aim where I tell him to?  I didn't tell him to throw the Taliban out of power.  I didn't tell him to kick Saddam's ass.  He did on his own.  And I commend him for it.  I love it when people are too scare to leave a real name or an e-mail address.  Although I do have is IP address, which is just as good.      POLL 2   As promised, here's the second of three polls.     How Many Medals Do You Think America Will Win In The Olympics This Year?   I'll just take my guess here instead of in the Rants.  I'm going to say 95 total.  40 Gold, 34 Silver and 21 Bronze.

       KERRY TRIED TO RUN   I've been looking around at some history on   urlLink Candidate Waffles   and ran across this.   "After an application for a twelve month deferment to study in Paris was denied, Kerry joined the United States Navy on February 18, 1966"   So for all his grandstanding and touting of his war record, he tried to run to Europe like "Bubba".  I wonder why he doesn't tell this part to people?  And what's all this year and a half to two years in Vietnam.  Kerry spent a total of eleven months there.  Anyway,   urlLink here's   the link.

       IT'S ALL BUSH'S FAULT   urlLink      CLICK FOR BIGGER IMAGE      urlLink Here's   a link to the story.  It's an interesting read, go check it out.  Here's part of the article.   "A study by Swiss and German scientists suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent global climate changes. Dr Sami Solanki, the director of the renowned Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Gottingen, Germany, who led the research, said: "The Sun has been at its strongest over the past 60 years and may now be affecting global temperatures."   So for all you nuts out there taking  The Day After Tomorrow as the truth, there you go.  Hell, I'm no scientist, but even I knew this.

       THAT'S JUST WRONG   A 58 year old woman in Belfast, Ireland has just won a record 20.1 million pounds ($37 million) in the lottery.  That's the good news.  The bad news.  She's suffering from cancer. She has cancer of the esophagus and is going through chemo now and is planning on having major surgery next month.  I'm not trying to be cruel.  I know what it's like to lose someone to cancer, but that's just not fair.  $37 million and she many not be around to enjoy it very long.  Damn.  She said the first thing she's going to do is take a vacation to Las Vegas with her husband and buy a new washing machine.  The rest of it's to ensure that her family and friends are secure for life.   Credit:   urlLink Yahoo! News      HYPOCRITE     urlLink Candidate Waffles   newest jolly is preaching from the book of Michael Moore.  Kerry's been talking about W's reaction to the news of 9/11.  Well, it seems that Kerry and a few other Dems didn't know what to do for  40 minutes .  What Kerry told Larry King   "I was in the Capitol. We'd just had a meeting - we'd just come into a leadership meeting in Tom Daschle's office, looking out at the Capitol. And as I came in, Barbara Boxer and Harry Reid were standing there, and we watched the second plane come in to the building. And we shortly thereafter sat down at the table and then we just realized nobody could think, and then boom, right behind us, we saw the cloud of explosion at the Pentagon. And then word came from the White House, they were evacuating, and we were to evacuate, and so we immediately began the evacuation"   The second plane hit the tower at 9:03.  The Pentagon was hit a 9:43.  40 minutes.  He's bitching about, what was it, seven minutes?  That's why Kerry's an ass.  Bush knew what to do.  Try not to scare those kids.  Kerry, in his fashion, couldn't make up his mind what to do.   Credit:   urlLink NewsMax      The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       NEW SECTION AND BLOGS   Scroll down and you'll find a new section under  Heroes .  It's  Truth About Kerry .  It's a collection of great sites that try to shed some light on   urlLink Candidate Waffles  .  Two notes.  Swift Boat Vets For Truth is a real site, but for some reason isn't loading.  Hopefully that'll be fixed soon.  And check out U.S.S. Yorktown.  It's from a Vietnam vet who's willing to support Kerry if only he would answer a few questions.  Some good cartoons there.    I like this one.  Some great questions for Kerry as well.  If you know of any more sites that you think I should add, let me know so I can get them up.  I've also added two new blogs.

       LOCAL MADMAN      Pictured above is Scott Eizember.  I don't how many people remember last year when he went on a rampage killing a 70 year old couple, attempted murder of a 16 year old boy and the beating of his grandmother.  After he was captured, he then escaped from jail.  Then started a 5 week search for him.  He had kidnapped a couple in Arkansas and forced them to drive him to Texas.  And here's where it gets good.  The man he kidnapped talked him into pulling over at a rest stop.  When Eizember did, the man was able to grab a gun in his van and shoot him.  He assaulted the couple and stole their van.  He was later captured after we went to a fast food store asking for help.  He was gone by the time police arrived, but they were able to catch him from the clerks description.  Why am I doing this post some may be asking themselves.  Because I just wanted to show that picture that was in yesterdays paper.  Look at his eyes.  The man is pure evil.  Reminded me of Charles Manson.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       WAY TO GO MISSOURI   The citizens of Missouri have stood up and said "No" to gay marriage.  71% of the people in Missouri are against gay marriage and they voted to amend the state constitution to allow only a marriage between a man and woman.  But you know some activist judge who thinks he/she knows better will try to over turn this with the help of the Anti-Conservative Liberal Union.  The great state of Oklahoma has a vote on this in November I believe.  Can't wait for this vote.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

       STEM CELL RESEARCH   There's been a lot of talk about stem cell research recently.  What with Ronald Reagan dying and Ron Reagan appearing at the DNC to talk about the subject.  There's also talk about how Bush is against stem cell research.  But that's false.  He's not against stem cell research, it's embryonic stem cell research he's against.  They're are two different types of stem cells.  Embryonic and Somatic(Adult) stem cells.  President Bush has given government funding to both.  I've looked everywhere and can't find how much funding he's approved.  Maybe someone reading this can find it and let us know.  There's also the fact that no one knows if stem cells are even able to do the things some think they can.  People are all in a tizzy thinking they could cure cancer and Alzheimers, but the truth of the matter is we don't know.  I support the research of Somatic stem cells but not embryonic.  If they're capable of doing what many believe, the that's awesome.  I hope they can.    urlLink Here's   a great site to read up on stem cells.  Thanks to   urlLink Claudia   for the idea of this post.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing

That list is posted on everyone of those sites.  Just think of all the readers you could get then.   urlLink       BIG MEDIA COVER UP?      Remember during the anti-freedom protests, news outlets made sure they got shots of signs that compared Bush to Hitler?  Well, there seems to be a new sign out on the campaign trial, but Big Media have yet to get this on air or print.  It's a sign that reads "Flush The Johns".  These signs have been showing up all over the place.  Bush speeches, Cheney speeches, Kerry speeches and Edwards speeches.  How come camera men haven't gotten shots of these things?  Is the Kerry loving media hoping that if less people know about these signs they'll just go away?

       "ARTWORK":  ALL HE NEEDS IS THE POWER       I was reading   urlLink La Shawn's   blog and she has a post up that inspired this picture.  She has a quote from someone named Star Parker from   urlLink Urban Cure   that wrote   "The Kerry-Edwards ticket is perhaps the wealthiest team to ever run for the White House. Do blacks really need these guys, with their $2,000 suits and $300 haircuts, telling them that they need government to solve all their problems, decide where and how to educate their kids and provide for their health care"   It's good to see some are smart enough to not blindly follow the Democratic party like sheep.

       AL FRANKEN BACK ON TV    The Al Franken Show  is heading to television.  The Sundance Channel, and obscure satellite and digital cable channel, will be showing a one hour version of Franken's show starting in September.  They're taking the best of his three hour show and turning it into a one hour telecast.  The best of his show?  What are they going to do with the other 59 minutes 50 seconds?  Because the best of  The Al Franken Show  is the part where he signs off for the day.   "Sundance plans to keep the satirist on its network through the November U.S. presidential election, and possibly beyond, a spokesman for Franken said"   I wonder who the Sundace Channel supports for president?  I guess both parties think this will help each others ratings.  Franken will get all 5 of Sundances viewers and Sundance will get both of Franken's listeners.  It's a win win situation.

       WOULD I DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN?   You're damn right he would.  During Bush's press conference this morning he started talking about WMD in Iraq.  Something to the effect of   "We all thought there would stockpiles of weapons.  I did, the U.N. did, Clinton did, many people did.  We may still find weapons."   Then he reaffirmed why he's a great leader.  He said   "Knowing what I know now, I would done the same thing."   That's why I like the man.  He sticks to what he says, unlike   urlLink Candidate Waffles   who refuses to acknowledge that he was smart enough to make up his own mind about WMD's.  He seems to want to blame Bush for his own actions.  That's what children do.  The president of the United States doesn't pass the blame.    AS IF THEY LOVED US BEFORE   According to Kerry, Bush has made the terrorists hate America even more than before.   "The policies of this administration, I believe ... have resulted in an increase of animosity and anger focused on the United States of America.  And the intelligence agencies of our country will tell you .... the people who are training terror, are using our actions as a means of recruitment"   Well, duh.  That's because he fought back.  He didn't cower in the corner like Clinton did.  One attack was all it took for Bush to show why we won't be bullied around.

       NEW "ARTWORK": PLAN FOR THE FUTURE       To go along with   urlLink this   story.    GAME GEEKS      If you're a video game geek like me, Jake, I'm looking at you, then chances are you're wetting your pants waiting for tomorrow.  After something like five years, Doom 3 is finally being released.  Myself, I've been waiting for two years for this game to come out.  Ever since I saw a short video clip of it from E3.  This thing has been hyped to the point of it being something of a mythological game, and from what I've read it won't dissapoint.  It's times like these I wish I was running something faster than a 1.7GHz Celeron and a Geforce 4 card.  But my rig should run it with satisfactory results.

       WAS IT FOR HIM?   I was going though some of my Pink Floyd songs yesterday that I haven't listened to in a while, and I came across one made me sit up and pay attention.  Here's the lyrics to  Pigs (Three Different Ones)    Big man, pig man, ha ha, charade you are You well heeled big wheel, ha ha, charade you are And when your hand is on your heart You're nearly a good laugh Almost a joker With your head down in the pig bin Saying "keep on digging" Pig stain on your fat chin What do you hope to find? When you're down in the pig mine You're nearly a laugh You're nearly a laugh But you're really a cry   I swear the first thing to pop into my mind was Michael Moore.     Big man, pig man, ha ha, charade you are .   If that's doesn't describe Moore to a tee, I don't know what does.  Big pig man who's a fraud.     And when your hand is on your heart You're nearly a good laugh  Moore likes to make us think he's the countries biggest patriot, but he contradicts that by his actions.     With your head down in the pig bin Saying "keep on digging" Pig stain on your fat chin What do you hope to find? When you're down in the pig mine  He'll dig anywhere, well, he'll have people dig for him, to find something to use in his movies.  And when he can't find what he wants, he makes it up.   You're nearly a laugh You're nearly a laugh But you're really a cry  He is almost funny, if he wasn't such a threat to the American people.  His lies are treated as truth and that in turn puts us in danger to extremists who hate us.    If I didn't know this song wasn't written in '77 before Moore became known I'd swear it was written about him.

       THANK YOU   This post is dedicated to the men and woman who have served and are serving in the United States military.  I've never been in the armed forces, so I don't even pretend to know everything you go through or the sacrifices you have made or are making.  But I just wanted to let you know that you have people back home who love, support and respect you and who wish you a safe and speedy return. You sacrifice everything in your lives for people you don't even know.  You may not call yourselves heroes, but that's what you are.      The first of every month, I'll post this message.  This is something that would be great to see take off.  It would be nice to see people honor and thank the men and woman who keep us safe.  What's great about this is that both Democrats and Republicans can participate.  If you would like to take part in this, just copy the bug above and save to your host site.  If you don't have one,   urlLink Photobucket   has a great free host site.  Show your support for the men and woman who defend our freedoms.
