       urlLink This article  explores the benefits and downfalls to both of the Broadband options of internet usage.  I know that in response to my paper (short research in class - posted in the discussion area) a few individuals did not fully understand the difference between DSL and Cable modem.  The article I have linked goes in to depth, and also takes a broad look at the Broadband marketplace, submitting predictions up to 2007.  I found this article very interesting because I have pondered the use of both broadband options, and was completely unsatisfied with my cable modem experience.  Because of my poor experience with broadband thus far, I have chosen to discontinue internet in my home entirely.  This article was interesting, and informative, and I suggest reading it to get a better understanding of Broadband and the two major options provided.

      In a related note to my blog on cell phones being  urlLink banned in Hong Kong locker rooms  due to picture taking of naked health club members, I have also found a list of the countries that ban cell phone use while driving; and to what extent the ban goes.  I am a believer in the ban of cell phone use while using a motor vehicle.  However, I have also been guilty of the currently repercussion-less (at least in WA) crime, and sometimes become weak at the sound and sight of a call from an important caller.   urlLink The list  is very interesting in not only seeing what the limits on usage are, and how they vary, but also in a broader sense, seeing how far technology touches around the globe.  Having lived in the United States of America my entire life, it is easy to grow complacent with the American standard of living.  Nevertheless, this list of countries that are seemingly affected by a problem that is prevalent and prominent in our society as well, bridges a gap that I never really considered prior.

      With the onslaught of new technology forced down our throats by Cell Phone companies, and the seemingly increasing desire for such devices, there also comes  urlLink drawbacks .  One such drawback is the invasion of privacy potential that the new picture phone contraptions can create.  So much so that in Hong Kong, some health clubs are outlawing the use of cell phones in locker rooms.  What is usually a blurry picture because of the low resolution capabilities of the average phone's screen, can easily increase in visibility on the internet.

      Very very  urlLink interesting article  in the "Seattle Times" on how a soldier was caught on tape attempting to defect to what he thought was Al Qeada.  The soldier in question was set-up in a sting operation, and the entire encounter with two under-cover agents was caught on a  digital camera .  The soldier is facing Article 32, which is the military equivalent to a grand jury proceeding.  Very scary stuff in the wake of our continued war against terrorism; one of our own attempting to give secrets to the enemy.  This story relates to digital communication because the entire conversation between the soldier and the under-cover agents was caught on a  digital camera .

      I am a person who is of the feeling that in a high-profile rape case, if the accused's identity is to be exposed, so should the accuser's.  My stance may seem insensitive, and it very well could evolve as time passes, or as my experience with rape potentially grows closer to home.  Nevetheless, I don't feel it's fair that Kobe and his wife's faces are plastered all over the world to be gawked at, while the "victim" who started this whole media circus, and trampling of Kobe's reputation attempts to remain hidden; furthered by the judge of the case's order to not  urlLink reveal her identity .  Disclaimer: there have been  urlLink misidentifications  made of Katelyn Faber, by several different sources, so I cannot be certain of my sources authenticity.  However, I did cross-reference the pictures on the link with others, and they were the most consistent.  Digtial communication enables the world to witness this entire case, and identify all parties involved.  It is a huge focus of American media, and close to the fascination of the OJ Simpson trial.

      I am not a big fan of our current president, or his cabinet, and found a  urlLink humorous website  that pokes fun at both.  Related to digital communication, this information would not have been as easily accessible for me without the internet, or innovations of the current day and age, specifically the computer.  Check it out, and get the obviously biased opinion of the website's creator.  It speicalizes in political cartoons, and the graphics are pretty tight.

      I chose to post  urlLink this article  because I was one: deeply saddened by the death of a musical pioneer, and legend; two: tired of seeing coverage of Ronald Reagan for the past week; three: not surprised a prominent black figure in American pop culture's death is easily overlooked in this country.  The media in this country is quick to spend an entire week...An ENTIRE WEEK on Ronald Reagan's death, but I couldn't get more than a 30 second fly by from MTV news a day after Mr. Charles had passed.  Granted, Reagan was a two-term president that accomplished quite a bit for our country.  However, Ray Charles also accomplished a significant amount for this country, specifically in regards to the color barrier in music, and how people perceived individuals with handicaps (Charles was a blind man).  I posted this article, and  urlLink another from CNN.com , because it needed to be posted and also because I can...It's my blog and I'll do what I want to...Do what I want to...Do what I want to...

      Usually, I would try and find articles that address products or services in which I have no direct connection, or an objective perspective.  However, I found  urlLink this article  particularly interesting because I am vested in one of the companies, and some of my friends (who are financial analysts) like to give me their two cents concerning the company I invested in.  All that being said, satellite radio is one of the newer innovations in digital media.  It allows a monthly subscriber ($9.95-$12.95 depending on the provider) to enjoy almost entirely commercial free music, without a great deal of static interference.  No matter where the subscriber travels with their satellite radio head unit, s/he will experience the highest quality of sound available for the radio market.  I chose to take a risk on Sirius Satellite Radio because at the time, about a year-and-a-half ago, when it was fairly cheap.  At the time, I was working full-time, and had some disposable income (that's like water in a desert these days), and decided to take a risk in the stock market.  Needless to say, I haven't lost my money, and have actually made a profit so far...Emphasis on the "so far" because one can never know when investing in the stock market.

      Yet another  urlLink source  for my research paper.  Interesting how the more I research, the more my thesis seems to evolve.  Luckily on this paper I haven't procrastinated like I have in past papers.  Still, with uncertainty surrounding my thesis, I'm not completely confident how my paper will turn out.  Nevertheless, I procrastinated enough to not have a draft turned in for review before the final draft was due (silent pat on the back).  All-in-all, the research has been eye-opening, and will provide me with the foundation for a stellar paper.  ;)

      The title should say it all, and since my access to the internet at home (my laptop) is not connected to a printer, and does not have a floppy drive (I know about thumb drives...you wanna buy me one?), I decided to blog the source where I could access it from anywhere.  The  urlLink source  seems strongly credible in its information, but also biased because the moderator or author of the site admittingly lost his daughter to cell phone usage.

      There was an article posted at  urlLink TechSpot  which referenced the results of tests completed on Plextor, Pioneer, and Panasonic DVD drives.  The articles lists results in the categories of: DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD+R, DVD+RW, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-ROM (read), CD-ROM (read), and price.  Great information for people interested in pricing and researching DVD burner-capable drives.  I was recently in the market, but purchased without doing what I would now consider enough research.  Wish I would have happened upon this article when I was shopping, as opposed to post to my purchase creating a sort of buyer's remorse...Ouch.

      A good  urlLink website for research  links related to cell phones and driving accidents.  I will use some of the links at the bottom of the page for my final research paper.  Along the same lines, I have yet to complete my research, but still appreciate any 'credible' resources I may stumble upon.  Updates may be in order upon my completion of research, so stay tuned.

      Yet another  urlLink article  concerning cell phones and the accidents that have been reported due to their use.  This is my final research paper's topic, and I found this resource very useful, yet slightly question the validity of the source(s).  My reason for being a bit uncertain about the source's credibility is because it comes primarily from a blog, with a link to a university's website, not directly showing the research of statistics related to reference in the article.  However, I chose to use it because it relates to my paper, and also because it was directly related to what myself and my peers are creating and maintaining: web logs.
