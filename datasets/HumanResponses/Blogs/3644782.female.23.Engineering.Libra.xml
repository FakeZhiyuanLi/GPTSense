      My head is close to bursting with this fever. My eyes feel as though they're going to pop, and my nose is stuffed so high it's probably the reason my eyes feel like their about to pop out.     *urgh*    To make things worse, I can't sleep, I have a craving for a Pizza Wrapz, sweet sweet soursop, a California Roll, a  paper thosai , and it's 1am. Weird combo, I know. God, what would I be like if I were  pregnant???  *shivers* It doesn't bear thinking.     And as if that isn't bad enough, I have the dreaded Mechanical Vibrations paper to sit for in 14 hours .. and I can't sleep!    It's anxiety, I tell you. The presentation for my final year project is next Monday. *sigh*    I've just learned something about myself: I don't handle stress well. I can handle it, certainly, but I just don't handle it well.     It's not so good, right now. I feel like I'm juggling more than I can handle. I can't wait for the next two months to go by. Results should be out by then. I don't know what I'll do if I don't pass! Maybe I'll go into a 2-month hibernation. That should make the agony of waiting more bearable.    *sigh* Yup, things are pretty sucky right now. I'm going to raid the fridge ....

      Meep! Today's Fluid Power paper was ridiculously simple. On one hand, I'm tempted to think "Be thankful for small favours" .. but there's a part of me that's totally freaking. I mean, was it supposed to be  that  easy?!?!     No, I am no genius, although I did study hard for it. I'm not bragging about my wonderous brain, because it really isn't that wonderous at all. My coursemate finished the paper in half an hour, for crying out loud! Ok, so he is the smartest one in our class, but it's still ridiculous!    So the paranoid part of me is freaking, wondering if there were any tricks in the questions I  completely  missed, therefore I'm going to flunk the paper royally! Then comes the other part of me telling me to chill, coz I did, after all, spend 20 minutes checking and rechecking, making sure they were no tricks, so I'm totally gonna ace the paper. Then Paranoid-Me starts hyperventilating again .. *sigh*    Somebody come and take these crazy people out of my head! They just won't shut up!     *Urgh* Although I must say that I do like this subject. May consider furthering in it later. Hydraulics ... Aaaah ... *G*    Fail or ace, it's over, so no use crying over spilt milk. I suppose the crying could be done over the failed grade later. Only *IF* it happens. Heh. *Crosses fingers*     This also means that I've got only   ONE   paper left!! Wahoo! Unfortunately, it's the Mechanical Vibrations paper, which I am somewhat sucky at .. so .. *takes a deep breath* Ah well, I guess I can only do my best. Hopefully my best is sufficient for a PASS, at least .. that's *all* I'm hoping for! I just want to get this studying business over with!!

      I just performed with my Rhythmic Ensemble group today. (Ensemble group - is that redundant?) It wasn't a major performance of any sort, just a little demo-ish kind of performance. Yeah, I did it *despite* it being the middle of Finals, but I just couldn't resist Jin's puppy-dog eyes and his plainitive pleas. I'm so soft-hearted sometimes, I make myself sick. :o) lolz .. but I also missed two rehearsals, resulting in my faking half the repertoir. Hee hee.  IT'S CALLED IMPROVISATION, BABEY!  *G* I had fun, nonetheless, and so did everybody else.     There was this kid, who was 'guesting' with us. He played the bass guitar and his drumming technique just blew me away. Seriously. The first time I heard his solo, I just gaped and gaped and completely missed my cue.. as did everybody else, so I was forgiven. :o) But the thing about this kid that struck me the most, completely aside from his technique, was his self-confidence. I'm 23 and I don't think I'm half as self-assured as this kid who's .. what? Nine years my junior?     I guess it was confidence in the things he has accomplished, his being aware of his potential, and knowing his limits. (He is quite the accomplished musician. He (or so he claims) taught himself the electric bass, electric guitar, drums, and classical guitar, although I have my suspicions about the classical guitar. His technique is really rather refined, NOT something you could pick up "just like that".)     Or perhaps it's that he doesn't think he HAS limits, hence the cocksure attitude. Were we all like that when we were 14? I certainly remember being something like that when I was that age .. that feeling of being able to take on anything life could throw at me .. and always emerging the glrious victor. Aaah .. youth. *G*    So, does living makes you uncertain of yourself? *ponders*    I don't know about others, but when I think of old people, I find them to be .. almost overly-cautious. Old people don't seem to be willing to take so many risks as someone younger would .. which brings me back to the question: Does Living make you Uncertain?     All I know, from personal experience, is that when I've failed at something, it makes me less sure. Sure I learn from my mistakes, and grow the wiser for it, but it makes me less sure all the same. What began as an almost non-existent smidgen of self-doubt grows bigger and bigger with every mistake made, and criticism received.     Oh, I don't let this get in the way of me being me. Am I being paradoxical? lol .. What I mean is, that although this self-doubt exists, it exists in this private, most personal part of my Self. I actually do make it a concious effort to not let it affect how I ultimately act, and how I ultimately regard myself.     I guess I am not too upset I possess this Self-Doubt. It acts as a reminder that I am not infallible, that I am not invincible ... but that's okay. It reminds me that I am only human .. prone to human mistakes, and prone to human failures .. and realising this also assures me that for every time I may fall down, I will always be able to pick myself right back up again. Resilience is, after all, the human nature. How else could we have possibly survived all these millenia! lolz ..     I wonder if the kid thinks about this .. and I wonder if I would feel the same about this when I'm 70. :oD    So, if the price of Wisdom is giving up the Cock-Sureness of Youth, then so be it. It won't be easy, but when you think about it, have we really got a choice?

      It's almost two in the a.m. ... *yawn* It's when it's late and I'm sleepy that it's most dangerous .. the weirdest things come to mind, unbidden, and tonight, it's death. Creepy .. *theme for the 'Twilight Zone'*    What is there beyond that great Black curtain? Concepts of Heaven and Eternal Hell .. they're beyond me. This suggests that there are clearly defined boundaries of good and evil, which I think is ridiculous as nothing, with the exception of nothing, is purely black nor white. Giving the simplest of examples, compare a man who steals to feed his hungry family because he has no other options, and a man who does nothing but gives praise to God all his life but neglects his family to do so. How do you begin to evaluate the good and the evil? Or is moderation next to Godliness?    What about Reincarnation, then? Condemned to forever repeat the life cycle until Nirvana is achieved? If that isn't a form of Hell, I don't know what is!    Or is it the Eternal Sleep, as the Ancient Egyptians believed? I must confess that I'm partial to the Ancient Sumerians' idea of The Great Void. Absolute nothingness. That's more or less what we experience when we sleep, anyways, apart from the dreams, which, by the way, I think is nothing more than our subconcious delusions. It never fails to amuse me how some people think dreams may be divine messages. Highly romantic, but hardly realistic. Yes, I'm a cynic-realist, in case you hadn't noticed by now.     *sigh* But it all boils down to this one question: What is the purpose of Life? If there was a purpose, it would make everything worthwhile.     We begin life by getting the best education we could possibly afford, and we go through life, never ceasing the learning process, gaining as much knowledge as we can .. but to what avail? To what purpose?    We slave through work all our adult lives, to make enough money so we may live comfortably while we're still alive.. but you definitely won't be able to take any of it with you into Death.     We do good on this Earth, giving aid to our fellow Man, giving praise to our Creator, with the promise of Eternal Reward at the end of our labours.. but what does anyone really know about the Hereafter? I believe there is a God, and on some days it is only my Faith that God exists that keeps me going .. but ultimately, we still don't know shit.    This saying just popped into my head:  "We make plans, God laughs."  Lol ... just a bit of dark humour.    My thoughts are morbid tonight. I suppose it's just a reflection of my current state of mind, tho. Sometimes I am just so sick of pretending to be happy and cheerful for the sake of others. Although I'm not the sort who gives two shits about other people's opinions, I also hate to be a burden. So when someone tells me to lighten up, be my old, cheerful self again (so full of life!), when all I really want to do is to tell them where to stick it, I put on my putridly sweet smile instead. So thank God for this space. It's refreshing to feel what I really feel once in a while.    Thesis Update: Almost done. Will be handed over this Friday.    Exms Update: Just sat for my Powder Metallurgy paper yesterday (Monday) afternoon (one down, three to go!!). It wasn't too difficult, and I'm pretty sure I aced the subject. The Thermal Power paper will be later this afternoon .. wish me luck!

      Hmm .. for someone who's supposedly busy working on her thesis, I sure am spending a lot of time here... :oD    Today, someone did something for me that was really sweet, and though it was expected coz I specifically asked for the favour, he went five extra miles to get it to me on time, and perfectly done, right down to the most minute detail. Fact is that he was under no obligation to help me, in fact had every right to refuse coz he himself was already really busy with other responsibilities. I would have understood had he not been able to deliver, yet he did. And then some.     So I'm writing this to express how grateful I am for his help, how grateful I am for him. If I lived a million years, I could never begin to repay everything he's done for me, and I'll never be able to describe exactly what he means to me.     Baby, thanks for everything. You mean so much more to me than you'll ever understand .. even if you don't want to.  I love you with all my being, and I don't care if you'd rather I don't ... coz I do! So there! lol.    It bites that I met you too late. I'll never forgive myself for that. But if not in this lifetime, then maybe the next. That doesn't make me feel any differently, though. You are my world, you always will be. Thank you for showing me how to love, and thank you for loving me.     Also, curse you, goddamit! I'll never get married now, coz the chances of my meeting another you is preeeeetty slim .. and after showing me my perfect guy exists, how can you expect me to settle for anything less???!?!! Damn you for setting an impossible standard for all future prospects to live up to!!     :o)    Baby, thanks. :o)    Okay .. enough with the mushiness! This is amusing.

      Still working on the thesis. Feeling extra worn-out. :o(    Why does loving someone make you feel the strangest things? Other people seem to feel .. *my vocabulary has gone to pot* .. I don't know. People usually describe it as uplifting, I suppose. I only feel lost. Maybe I was not born to handle love? Mee hee hee ...     I've got another quiz here. Eh heh .. it's so funny, but you've really got to have a sense of humour to appreciate it, I guess. Showed it to someone .. and she was mortally offended! *eh..*      Tramp Bear     urlLink   Which Dysfunctional Care Bear Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla         urlLink     Website Of The Day:  StrongBad!

      Argh .. I was writing an entry, when the page got changed, and the entry disappeared. *yeesh* Nevermind, ample time for me to ramble later. :oD    My life is still on hold due to the thesis (which is due Friday), my final papers (week after next), and the oral examination for my thesis (5th April!). I am quaking in my bunny slippers....    But whilst I was taking a break, I did a quiz .. I love quizzes, I'm *almost* addicted to them! hehee .. So here's the result. Look at the preeeetty picture!         You are a  PHOENIX  in your soul and your wings make a statement. Huge and born of flame, they burn with light and power and rebirth. Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an amazingly strong person. You survive, even flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear failure. You know that any mistake you make will teach you more about yourself and allow you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater being. Because of this, you rarely make the same mistake twice, and are not among the most forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion, and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality and know that life is tough and the world is cruel, and it takes strength and independence to survive it. And independence is your strongest point - you may care for others, and even depend on them...but when it comes right down to it, the only one you need is yourself. Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your wings to guide you.You are eternal and because you have a strong sense of who and what you are, no one can control your heart or mind, or even really influence your thinking. A symbol of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very spiritual person with a serious mind - never acting immature and harboring a superior disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's stupidity and tendency to want others to solve their problems for them frustrates you endlessly. Though you can be stubborn, outspoken, and haughty, I admire you greatly.   urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla        You are a forest shadow. Your essence is that of the tree or beast that casts you upon the earth. You feel a purpose to be in balance with the cycles of life and are wise and beautiful in your submission to the justice of Mother Nature. You are peaceful in nature and, though you feel small, your spirit is precious, strong, and mighty as the (green) forces with which it is affiliated.     urlLink   What Kind of Shadow Are You?

      Whoop-dee-doo! A blog of my very own! I've always been meaning to get one, but procrastination once again got in the way of my achieving something. Yes, the professional procrastinator, that's me. That's not to say I don't achieve anything (due to this nasty habit, I've also become a pro at getting things done in a jiffy ;OP) but it always makes me wonder how much better I could have done something if only I had put more time into it.  Not something to be proud of, fer sure, but there's something to admitting your weakness (or weaknesses) and dealing with it. Aiyaiyai! Must drop this habit. Maybe later ... *nye hee*    So, why do I want a blog? I suppose it could be that I can't keep anything about myself TO myself, but that has a slightly unsavoury ring to it, so I'll just say that it's bcoz I like sharing things with people. Hee hee.     But seriously, there's something undeniably therapeutic about writing out your thoughts where someone else can read them. It's like telling your problems to a stranger (poor stranger). Call it weird, but it's nonetheless unburdening to have someone else listen to you, regardless of whether or not people do read your blog.     Okey-dokey. (I really should stop using cute-sey phrases like this. It makes me uncool...) A little bit about me now.    I'm currently in my last MONTH of study (I study Mechanical Engineering) and what I really should be doing is working on my thesis, which, incidentally, is due next week. So what am I doing writing a blog entry???!!!??!! (deep breath) All together now:    PROCRASTINATING!!!!

       Oh when the veil of dream has lifted  And the fairy-tales have all been told  There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow  More precious than a pot of gold   In tales of ancient glory Every knight and maiden fair Shall be joined when the quest is over And the kiss is the oath that they swear   And when the veil of dream has lifted And the fairy-tales have all been told There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow More precious than a pot of gold    My sweet, my dear, my darling You're so far away from me Though an ocean of tears divides us Let the bridge of our love span the sea   Your kiss.... There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow, More precious than a pot of gold.   "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow" ~ The Folkmen     I'm in a wistful mood. It's raining outside. I pulled up the blinds and in the darkness watched the rain slither down my window panes. With my comforter wrapped around me in a sense of surrogate security, my mind is awhirl. My soul cries out    "Why???"     It rains inside as well.

      MAKSIM! MAKSIM! MAKSIM!!! *swooooooon*  Went to see him in action last night. Was totally not disappointed!! His technique was truly superb .. it's so mind-boggling when you see such wonderful precision with the keys *swooooon!* His talent! His charisma! His sexy-smooth voice! *swooooooooon!!* *G*  Funny thing is, I wouldn't have even known of it had  my Mak Ngah not called and offered me free tix. WOOHOO!! Of course I said yes, and immediately thought of who would most appreciate the experience as she offered to get me as many as I wanted. Eh heh. I  am  one to take advantage, I just don't take it too far. ;oP It was sorted! I would be going to see Maksim in  urlLink enjoyable company !!  At Yazmin's house after lunch, she received the unbeatable offer of FRONT ROW tickets to the concert!!! EeEeEeEeeee!! And we managed to get it! Double EeEeEeEeeee!!!!!! (I only found out later - through her blog! - that there was a small token to pay! Wait till I get my hands on you! If it was only one ticket for me, pun takpe. But I had a friend tagging along! Min .....) Anyway, the VIP tix were the best side of fantastic! Thanx so much, Min!! *huggles*  I'm not very eloquent even at the best of times, so you can read a better version of the concert  urlLink here , but when he came on (in almost-total darkness for almost half a minute, no thanks to careless lighting technicians), my first thought was,  "Alah! Halusnya!"  Really, he's so  cekeding! Aiyoh, kurusnya budak ni. Kat London takde makan ke?  And I was also wondering, eh, is it really him? I think he looks very little like his photos! I mean, I know some people can look very different in photographs, but this was the most extreme case of it I've ever seen. All doubts dissipated, however, upon the first few bars. There was no mistaking the flair and masterful precision! I was watching Maksim in action! Live! From the first three rows!!! EeEeEeEeeee!!   Absolutely unforgettable! Thanx Min! and Ija!! *huggles*  At home, I dropped like a sack due to being awake 36 hours. As usual, I was finishing the last of my thesis (which, by the way, was finally approved by my supervisor, which means no more sleepless nights!!) the night before, so I pulled a final all-nighter. The day then filled up pretty fast, and before I could turn twice, the Maksim concert was over! Slept like a log till noon (hey! I'm allowed! I've been working my butt off with minimal sleep for the past half a year because of that thesis!!) and woke to what I thought would be a leisurely day. Week. At least a month.  Wrong!! Mum immediately put me to work helping her out with this contract she's got, which would require my working 7 days a week, 4 to 10 every evening until the end of June. *AaAaAraaaargh*  Takde chance nak rileks lansung!  On the flip side, my  upah  is an  umrah  trip after this is all over. Yay! I've been meaning to go for so long now, I hope it happens! :o)

      There are some things all the money in the world cannot buy; amongst which are health, happiness, peace, class, manners, good breeding, and least of all respect.    Indubitably, posession of great material wealth is capable of buying you a degree of power, but to what purpose is that power?     Would it secure you a more comfortable life; a life more comfortable than that which you can already buy with your vast wealth? No, you don't need power to make a comfortable life.    Could power guarantee you the best of health? No. Money might be able to buy you the best medical treatments available, but power couldn't ensure your health.    Neither could power give you class, manners, nor good breeding. You could buy the most expensive designer rags with which to sheathe your body, you could buy the finest jewels for personal adornment, you can send yourself to the best schools in the world, you can boast of having an address book full-to-bursting of the personal numbers of the most hoity-toity who's who on an international scale, yet none of these could give you class, manners or good breeding.    Power can give you status, which in turn earns you a degree of respect. A form of it, at least.      Fuck. That.     What a lot of people respect is money. Money --> Status --> Respect. And that's how moneyed people end up being respected, no matter what kind of people they are. That's the natural progression. What it frankly is, is fucked up.     It's not that I don't understand how it got that way. What it is is a vicious cycle. People need money to survive, more so of poor people. Where they can get money from is the Rich. The Rich then exploit the Poor, because the Poor have no choice, to make Themselves richer. At the same time, you can't have these  anjing kurap tepi jalan  getting anywhere near as prosperous as the Rich, coz then Society would  really  have gone to the dogs. Oh yes, the unfortunate degeneration of society would really begin then. So what you have would be the Rich getting Richer off the repressed Poor .. and congratulations to the Rich for maintaining their exclusive position! After all, why shouldn't they keep their exalted positions as Gods who dwell in the Mt. Olympus of Society, high above the Poor Nothings and Nobodys? They're Rich! They've got something the Poor don't: Power! They've got Respect! They've  earned  that respect with their dollars, they  deserve  that respect!!! The Poor shouldn't aspire to too much, after all.  Bodoh. Kalau pandai, takkan miskin. Kuli. Nak kaya?!  Ada hati, konon.   Sometimes the Rich conveniently forget their roots.     The Rich get richer, the Poor remain repressed.     Money is the Root of All Evil. I beg to differ. The Greed for Money is The Root of All Evil.    What bothers me is not the Money. It's how people act (and react) to it. Money is only Money. When people start believing it is something more than it actually is, that's where the seeds of Evil are planted. I would be a hypocrite if I said that I didn't want a lot of money to buy nice things, but I don't want my wealth to be built on the misery of others. How the fuck could I live with myself? How could I eat the food bought with tainted money? How could I sleep in the bed begotten of other's misery?    Power corrupts. Insidiously, and absolutely. Too often power turns people into egomaniacs. Admittedly, not all people with money and/or position turn out this way, but let's be honest, how many don't? Already inflated egos then become more pumped up by carpet-baggers, ass-kissers, boot-lickers and  barwahs  who latch on, hoping for scraps to fall from the tables, hoping to catch a free ride to Money Land.     What never ceases to amaze me is that Rich actually  wants  people like these around him, more often than not for the sole purpose of having someone to stroke his egos and for him to bully. Filthy scum of society. I dare any of them to be honest just once in their lives. Show me the company you keep and I'll show you who you are.    And I will never understand how the Rich always try to repress those not in their strata. What the fuck is so wrong about helping someone else become rich as well? What!!?  Hina sangat ke  a person who's only trying to make the best life he can for himself and his family? Who's only trying to earn an honest and decent living? Who's only trying to carve out a place for himself in this world?  Hina sangat ke sampai  you have to deride him, and belittle his hard, honest efforts, and laugh at his idealistic ideas of morals and principles?     All to often, it's the dishonest ones who prosper in their dealings. Why is it so unfair? Why does God reward the ones without scruples with material wealth? The ones who have no compassion, no kindness?  Orang tak beragama ? Why is it that we're always saying  "Takpe. Nanti Tuhan bagi balasannya."  Why can't they get their just desserts now? Why? Why? Why?    Years ago, I first became disillusioned with humanity. More years of observation, the disillusionment only gets greater. I have no more faith in humanity. To me, society has already gone to hell. It no longer serves a useful function. If only there were a nuclear catastrophe, or another ice-age, then humanity could start again from scratch. There's no guarantee it won't turn out the very same way, but we need to realise the .. I want to say 'obligations' or 'responsibility', but I think it'd be inaccurate .. but we need to think beyond the Self. I think the Buddhists have it right when they say that attachments and obsessions with the material world causes Suffering.     All this misery and suffering caused by material things and their superficial derivatives (i.e. "Power" and "Status") are nothing but a bunch of crock. That's why I absolutely  hate  it when someone says to me, "You're too good for me, above my status.  Takkan I nak mengharap pulak. " What the fuck is status beyond something insecure rich people invented to reassure themselves? It is  nothing  but illusion and petty games.     I don't give a fuck if it's called being rude, but   I don't give a fuck   if you were born the Queen of England, or the Raja Muda of Selangor, or if your father was a goddamned gajillionare.     What earns respect is achievement. You earn respect because of the things you've done, of the principles you uphold, of the good and kindness you've committed. Your deeds speak for themselves, and your deeds determine the level of respect you are owed. Being born into a "socially prominent family" doesn't hold shit for me. No respect is owed for an accident of birth. More often than not, I find "socially prominent families" utterly disgusting, dispicable and disgraceful. Usually it's due to their own exalted opinion of themselves and the degrading way they treat - and think of - others. Whatever society in which they are regarded as 'creme of the crop', I don't want to live in.    Yes, once again, I acknolwedge that not everyone is like this, I know some good, rich people too. But what a minority.    A volunteer at the SPCA who cleans after cat-poo could be more deserving of respect than some  kononnya  high-and-mighty Tan Sri (who, by the way, almost definitely  bought  his title). Respect should be paid to deeds, not money nor status. It's unfortunate that the illusions of power are so tightly enmeshed in the workings of society that nowadays respect is so often casually demanded (and as unthinkingly given!) for the poorest and lamest of reasons. Respect, if not truly earned, is no respect at all.     I am not proclaiming that I have superior morals. I'll be the first to admit my deficiencies, but I believe there are common values in this world that transcend religion and spiritual beliefs. Regardless of what religion you ascribe to, or do not, there exists this natural law which differentiates the good from the bad, and that this knowledge is inherent in every human being. That (some) people deliberately disregard what instinct tells them is wrong disappoints me profoundly, hence the loss of faith in humanity. Sure, there must surely be more good people in this world than the bad, but that the bad ones seem to be able to take dominance with the good people being almost unable to do anything about it .. I just no longer have any faith. All will be settled after the material world no longer counts .. or so I hope. It's the one thing I have any faith left for.     >:o(  I just needed to rant. I guess this was set off by .. a recent incident. It is unfortunate that the people who seem to be amongst the worst transgressors of basic decency and common courtesy happen to be members of my family. I am so utterly disappointed and ashamed. They were once ... decent people. I believe they once knew humility, and kindness. Once upon a time. The Love of Money corrupts; Power corrupts utterly.    In a way, I am grateful to have known them, to have seen them like this. It will serve as a life-long warning for me against the lures of false Status and the dangers of becoming too heady with Power.    Having the power to immediately secure a table in any busy restaurant, to buy the hotel should the doorman bar you entry, to order Mercedes-Benz to design a car just-for-you .. all these things are ultimately inconsequential. To be kind, to be compassionate, to be considerate .. these things matter.     Riches do not equate class. Knowing who's who in society, which fork goes with which dish, having a posh accent, and being able to speak French does not equate manners. Being a member (sometimes even being a pseudo-member is good enough!) of a "socially prominent family" does not guarantee good breeding.    Poise, finesse, elegance, good manners, gentility, integrity, class, genuine respect. None of these can be bought, not if you owned the world. I could be dead poor, but I'll bet I could still have manners, class, and truly deserved, truly earned respect.

      What is it about nighttime that inspires me to weird thoughts??? Or maybe I should just stop playing  Minesweeper . You won't believe the things I think when I play that game ...     After an earlier conversation with   urlLink a friend   about .. well, this and that .. it, indirectly, got me to thinking about me and my ... umm .. reluctance towards relationships. To quote the mightly irked Mr. X: "You're afraid of commitment!!!!" ::rolleyes:: I, at the time, dismissed his accusation as pure bosh as it wasn't that I was afraid of commitment, I just didn't want to commit myself to him! He was a whiny, fussy, really  melemaskan  type, the kind of guy who had to call every 2 hours to see what I was doing, and because he missed me.  ?????????  Get real. It's not sweet, it's helluva irritating. Makes me wonder what I ever saw in him. Hmmm .... Maybe I thought he was cute, but whatever physical attraction there might have been initially was totally overridden by his irritating-ness.  Yes, I have this nasty habit of inventing words when my vocabulary fails me.      *Flicks on a lighter and sways to Broery Marantika's Jangan Ada Dusta Antara Kita*  Sorry. Nice song.     Now, where was I? Oh, yes. Anyway, at the time, I may have not commit for the right reasons. I plainly didn't like him. Anymore.     But after (and some before) him came guys who I did like. Nice, decent guys. Unfortunately, still no commitments. Why not, for Heaven's sake, if I like them? The reason is quite simple: I am notoriously picky, and they were not ideal. *sigh* Hence, still single, never had a boyfriend. Ever. I don't know if any of them ever considered me a girlfriend at some point or another (I suspect that some did), but I couldn't say I thought of any of them as my boyfriend. Significant Other. I guess it takes love for you to think of someone that way, and thought I was - and still am - incredibly fond of some of them, I never really loved any of them.     So I didn't make the commitments because I didn't think it was fair for them to be in a one-sided relationship. I honestly believed that they deserved much more than what pittance I was giving them. Good men, who deserved more than what I wasn't willing to give. Besides, it made me feel like a Wicked Witch, the way I was treating them. I suppose it could be argued that I might have eventually fallen in love with them, given time, but I really didn't feel that it was right. What happens if I then met the real man of my dreams?    And there you have it. Tonight, after talking to   urlLink Yazmin  , it occured to me that there may have been some truth to Mr. X's exasperated accusation, after all. I   am   afraid of commitment. What if I had made a commitment to someone, THEN met the real man of my dreams?  That  is what I'm afraid of. I can't help but think I'd've robbed myself of too much if that were to happen, not to mention how unfair it would be to whoever it was I'd committed to at the time.     But doesn't 'commitment' mean you should stand by your choices, come what may? Yes, exactly. I know that should that happen, then I  would  honour my commitment, but at the same time, I wouldn't be able to help feeling resentment; resentment with the whole situation, resentment at whomever I'm with because he isn't perfect, and resentment with Mr. Wonderful because he hadn't appeared in my life sooner. Not fair? Certainly, but whoever said emotions had ever been fair? That's why nobody should think with their hearts.    Besides, I hate breaking promises, and if commitments are anything, they're promises. It's my policy to never make promises I can't and know that I will be unable to keep. Thus, I am not good at this breaking-up business, so I avoid it altogether by not making any promises! Wahey!     I have a horde of aunts and uncles who are getting increasingly concerned about my unchanging 'single' status. lolz ... I've heard that the first thought of a persistently single female is that she might be gay. Hmmm.. there's a thought ... lolz! No way. I don't have anything against lesbianism, but I find men waaaaay too yummy to give up. *winkz*    But as a result of all that concern, everytime I attend a family do, I'm absolutely inundated with "Do you have a boyfriend yet?", "Are you  still  single?!?!!", "I have this friend who has a son ....  Baik orangnya ." God help me. But of most concern to me is the advice I've been getting from well-meaning aunts, uncles, and proxy-parents. It seems almost universally agreed upon that I shouldn't be too .. umm .. selective. You take the best you've got, and make the best out of it that you can. That's what marriage (and life) is all about.    Are they right? Am I setting the bar too high? Should I compromise my ideals and lower my standards merely for the sake of having someone around? Have I been too idealistic? (Why is it that we always ask others to affirm our beliefs? Does .. should! .. an objective opinion from the outside really matter when it's a personal matter??? Questions, questions....)    Like I've said time and time again, I don't see the point in being with someone I'll eventually loathe just for the sake of having someone around now. I want ONE marriage to last till the end of my days.     But .. I do respect the Wisdom of the elders, and sometimes I wonder if they might be right. However, I've seen too many examples (again, the elders) of how that doesn't really seem to work either. Sure, they're still married, but they're not happy, not truly happy. Why would I want that for myself? Putting up with being alone is, I think, by far preferable than putting up with someone you can barely tolerate.    *thinking* However, my mother never once gave me that advice. She always told me to settle for nothing less than the best I can get .. well, and also that if you make your bed, then you'll have to lie with whatever (and whoever) is in it. Hee hee.    So what shall I do? At present, I don't see a better mechanism for myself, so I'll hold on to my stance, thank you very much. When I  did  meet Mr. Wonderful,  he  had already made a prior commitment. Peh. So what now? I'll wait for Mr. Wonderful II.

      I'm in a ... dreamy ... mood right now, thanks to Mr.   urlLink Amir Yussof  , who is possibly the best Malaysian artiste today. Arguable, of course, but it'd take waaaay too much to make me concede even an inch otherwise, so it would probably be best to just agree with me.   Wonderful stuff. Well, if you're into folk rock, then it's wonderful stuff, I guess; but it's also wonderfully melodic. The composition is somewhat complex, although it comes across as pleasantly simple. Very tuneful as well, besides having this amazing, soothing quality. And he's just soooo gosh darned sexy! Those dreads .. *swoon* .... I highly recommend   urlLink his   music. Best of all, he allows   urlLink free downloads   of some of his songs for samplers! Check out "Little Bird". Absolute genius, the man is. Also, I could put up with a lifetime of pure nagging from that voice. *swoon*    Sometimes people surprise you. You always have this idea of what a person is like .. and while with some people you can tell rightaway what they're like, some manage to surprise you. It's true that you can never (or is it should never?) judge a book by it's cover.     Shrek : An ogre is like ... an onion!  Donkey : ... They stink?  Shrek : Yes!! No!! They've got many layers!!   I've always prescribed to:  Expect nothing from anyone, for when you have no expectations, everything else that happens can only be a pleasant surprise.  Yes, I made that up. If you don't expect anything, then you'll never be disappointed. This is most especially true of loved ones. I try to not expect anything from them, because your loved ones are the ones capable of causing you the most grief.  I was pleasantly surprised today. I can't complain. :o)    Speaking of loved ones, one called today asking for help. It sounded serious. I can help, I'm more than capable of helping .. but if I do, I'm almost certain it's got something to do (indirectly) with something I disapprove of. However, that's none of my business.   What I've decided to do is help. Somewhat reluctantly, to be sure, but I'll help, no conditions posed, no questions asked. I know it wasn't a request easily made either, so ...   sigh* I'm such a softie sometimes that I make myself sick. I've always thought that I'm not easily manipulated, but if I'm honest with myself, manipulation doesn't work with me only if it's freakingly obvious. I cave in whenever the 'guilt' and 'sympathy' cards are played. I cave in worse than a termite-infested  rumah papan.  *sigh* God help me if anyone manages to get past that hard-candy shell .. I'm all gooey caramel inside. No resistance, I tell you. Whoever said compassion is a virtue?? *Not that I think myself overly compassionate. Passionate, maybe, but not compassionate. *G**  Well, I got lots of thanks and promises for payback, but the thing is, I didn't do it because I wanted eternal gratitude or payback with interest, I did it because a friend asked for help. What else can you do when your friends tell you they've reached a dead end? *sigh* That's what friends are for, anyway. I just hope that should I ever be in such need myself that I'll have friends I can count on too.  Unlike ONE person ... *grumbles* ... who actually keeps a tally of everything nice  HE's  done for me, but conveniently forgot everything nice I did for him. According to him, I never did ONE single nice thing for him in all our years of friendship. Not ONE single thing!!   Yeah, I'm still sore over his saying that ... and yet I've more or less given up the grudge. OoOoOooh, I've yet to forgive him for it .. nothing short of a full acknowledgement of his error AND an  elaborate  apology could make me forgive him!! Yes, I never forget, but I no longer hold a grudge. Well, not much of a grudge left anyway ... and it also helps that I can now be as sharp-tongued as I like to him whenever I feel spiteful, knowing full well he deserves it for being such an ass! Yes, I can be quite spiteful and mean too, but only under provocation. *Grrrrr* Okay, rant over.  Anyhow, friends are friends, unconditionally. Well, most of them are, anyway. *roll eyes* All I really expect from them are for them to be there for me as I am always there for them, on call 24/7, 365-and-a-quarter.   ... Or should I really NOT expect anything from them at all? :o)      **AMIR YUSSOF**   *swooooooon*            Photos Copyright © Amir Yussof 2002

      Yikes. I just found out that the lastest guy I'm dating is 2 years my junior. ... .... ..... Yikes.    I've always maintained that age is just a number, that it's more a state of mind. Today, I've realised that I am a liar. No, not really. Perhaps it'd be more apt to say that I've been deluding myself somewhat. I've discovered that age, to me, is just a number ... but only if the guy is older than I. Or the same age. Or born in the same Gregorian calendar year. God help him, though, if he were born on the 1st of January, 1981. I don't know why, but I've never been able to be interested in younger men. Boys. Okay, there may be the source of it all. I think of younger men as boys. *A truly lightbulb moment there. The cartoon 'blink' at that moment of relevation was almost audible.*    I like my men to be Men. I've dated more than my fair share of boys, enough, at any rate, to come into the realisation of knowing what I want; and I want a Man.    I want a man with integrity. I want a man who is honest. (An honest man - a paradox? lol. Still, a girl can wish.) I want a man who is able to take resposibility, and I want a man with a decent sense of right and wrong. I want a man who   is   a man.     Oh, but one more thing. I want that man to be not gay. Gay men can be men as well, I know some of them who are amongst the finest specimen of Men, but I want a heterosexual man. *winkz*    Those are the bare basics, and highly general. Those characteristics, which woman does not yearn for, demand? More personally, I want a Man who knows how to treat me right. I don't believe chivalry is totally dead, it's just that most men have forgotten it. I want him to hold doors for me and pass through them only after me, to watch the path for me so I don't wet my feet in puddles, to comb the town for the perfect cheesecake for me if I so much as make the slightest comment of how much I love cheesecakes. I want that with him, I feel like a Woman. I don't care if all this may seem like backtracking the feminist movement, I am a woman and I dare any woman to tell me that she would not like to be treated thus.    I want a Man who makes me laugh, I want a Man who knows how to handle me. I'm fully aware that I'm not an easy person to handle, what with my odd random rantings, and sporadic bouts of moodiness, but I want a Man who can handle Me. I want a Man whose taste in music and interests match mine to a 'T'. I want a Man with whom I need not even complete my sentences for him to know what I mean. Heck, I don't even have to make a peep for him to know what I'm thinking. It's almost as though breathing is communication enough.     I want a Man who would love me for simply me, no more, no less, for that is all I have to offer. I want a Man who has no delusions of a fairytale love, for we all know that it does not exist. I want a Man who has both feet planted firmly on the ground, a Man with a strong sense of practicality and reason, but who in all this still retains the ability to dream.    I want a Man whom I can shower all my love on. I want a Man whom I can make happy, whose every wish I would have the opportunity to fulfil. I want this Man with whom I could grow old with, with whom I could share my life with, with whom I would live for, with whom I would die for. I want this Man with whom I would learn new things about every day, and love him more and more for each little lesson. Just as I want him to treat me as a Queen, I want him to be my King.     Am I asking for too much? I don't think so. I am not asking any man to  BE  any of this, what I am waiting for is the Man who   IS   all this. I may end up waiting forever, but believe I owe it to myself to choose the best I can, and I would sooner end up alone than settle for second best. That is my promise. The question is, does He really exist?    *silence* Unfairly, perhaps, I've realised that I've described  this one Man.  I believe that had I not met him, I would never have known perfection existed, and I would not have made that promise I did make to myself. He's not the most perfect human being on the planet, but being aware of my own inadequacies and character, he's nothing short of Perfect for me; no more, no less. The requirements for my Dream Man preceeded him; meeting him in the flesh was the singular most startling (and wonderous) discovery of my life. Unfortunately, he did not fulfil what is, perhaps, the most important requirement: that he had to be available. Sometimes I think that God has an extremely wicked sense of humour.  Cubaan.... *ala Pendekar Bujang Lapuk*     Is he the One? The Only One I will ever meet my entire life? I believe not. There will be others like him, none exactly like him but, I believe, just as good. Whilst I believe in things like Love and Fate and Destiny, I don't believe that in the course of our lives, we will only fall in love with that ONE person, that each of us has only ONE TRUE Love. I believe our hearts are much too big for that.    Likewise, I believe that there is somebody (or some people?) for whom I am perfect for, without effort. It takes too much to be somebody I'm not, and  that  I will never be intimidated into being. True luck would be in us being perfect for each other. I am ever the optimist.    But I digress hugely from the theme I started off on. Yeah, to top off all that, I would also require him to be older than me. Well, not so much as  require  as imagine. I've always imagined my Dream Guy to be older than me. Always 4-6 years older. No, don't ask me how I came about these numbers as I haven't the foggiest. My mind works in bizzare ways.     This latest guy, I like him. For all that he's 22, he works to support his mother and brother as his dad has passed on. He's got dreams, and he seems to be capable of making them all come true. He's funny, no slouch in the brains department, and extremely amiable.     But from the outset I could tell that he's not everything I want. It's been a while now, and he's still nowhere near everything I want. I would love to keep him around for company's sake, but I wonder if it would be doing him an injustice?    And now to aggravate matters further, I find out he's younger than I. (I think he senses my hesitation in this as he's gone through some pains to subtly convince me that it's really no big deal. How sweet.) I really don't know why I'm so hung up on it, or why this should matter so much, I only know that it does! I'm trying to not let it bother me, and it works when I'm not thinking about it, but sometimes somethings just set me off on it again. *sigh* We're all prone to our little prejudices, and believe you me, I realise just how unfair this is little prejudice of mine is. Ah well, all I can promise is that I'll try my best, no more, no less. After all, did I not just write in my last entry about letting go of inhibitions?

      *yawn*     Nothing of great interest has occurred since the last entry, nor has anything weird popped into my head for me to muse about. So why am I writing? It may have something to do with the fact that I am a new blogger and, perhaps, as a result have this nagging compulsion to write something .. anything! .. for filler's sake. lol .. obsessive, obsessive me ...    Speaking of obsessions, the new group exercise schedules at Fitness First DU are out .. whoopee! .. and sad as it may be, I have now planned entire weeks around said schedule. I am turning into a gym-junkie. (But it's just so much  fun!!! ) lolz .. If you told me a year ago that I would be going to the gym for  fun , I would have written you off as being completely insane, and a  wishful  madperson at that! Oh, how things change! Yes, the once-incorregible sloth now goes to the gym when there is nothing else to do. (Watch TV? They've got 8 channels of ASTRO at the gym!) Of course, the muito macho gym instructors who make up the veritable smorgasboard of eye-candy provide the divine inspiration and unparallelled motivation for hoofing it over to the gym. They definitely make working out sooooo much more of an oogle-cum-flirt-fest and less a chore!! *hee hee heeeee..*      Yes, the group exercises are a ton of fun .. yes, even despite the aching muscles that lasts for days after. I wonder if I may be slightly masochistic; those aches and pains actually make me feel .. like I'm doing something useful. *????* lolz .. This feeling of needing to feel useful may have something to do with my current state of being stuck in a rut. Funny, isn't it, what a sense of lack of accomplishment does to the psyche?    Well, as it's all in line of my efforts to lose weight anyway ... Although thinking about it now, there hasn't been significant change in that department since I first joined the gym in October .. *hmm* .. There you have it, ladies and gents. Going to the gym DOES NOT aid in weight loss. *bleah* Well, at least it's built up my stamina. I actually managed to take in a 1-hour trek  without  wheezing like an asthmatic elephant! Hooray for me! *G*    I read   urlLink this   today. I wonder that people often take things too seriously nowadays. I thought the piece was extremely beautiful .. and sad. It was an important reminder to the necessity of letting your inhibitions go. Your writings have never failed to move me, Min. :o)

      What a rejuvenating weekend!     Was over at Min's for a mini-slumber party. It was only an eetsy-beetsy party, as there were only 2 guests who, incidentally, only arrived at 11-ish .. but what we lacked in quantity, we made up for in quality.     Despite it being close to midnight, I arrived to the happy splish-sploshing of Min and Intan who *simply couldn't wait* for my arrival before jumping into the pool.  Babysitting duties had to come first, la...   Nevertheless, I managed to join them in good time, and what began as an oh-so-chilly dip evolved into a full-fledged catching-up-on-the-latest-gossip session (of which, due to the 2-month incarceration, I was woefully behind on!), some semi-exercise, a mini refresh-your-vocabulary lesson by Intan, and a thorough testing of the amazing amplifying properties of water. We really should have gone round apologizing to your neighbours in the morning!    This was then followed by "Mona Lisa Smile", where not only did the students of Wellesley College and Ms Catherine Watson learn a few lessons, but so did I. Comparisons to "Dead Poets Society" are inevitable, but while critics (other critics, that is. ;op) condemn MLS to being a poorer 'copy' of DPS, I beg to differ. While it is true that the basis of the movies are alike, but even in similar circumstances, many different lessons may be taught .. and learned.     Although I did not find the movie 'powerful', it nevertheless made quite an impression on me. This may strongly be due to the fact that it is a story about women and I am a woman. :o) It also made me realise how lucky I am to be a woman living in this present era.    It also makes me wonder: Had I been a woman of that era (i.e. the 50's), would I have held those same values and ideals dear? Which further brings me to the issue of whether should we, in this present day and age, allow society's ideals and demands set the mould for the shapes of our lives and guide our decisions? For if we do, then are we really any different from the women portrayed in that movie?     I thought that that was the singular lesson of that movie: not allowing the common census dictate the pattern of which your life would follow.    Understandably, there is a reason why Norms of Society   are   Norms of Society, but I have long held the belief that unless you yourself agree with said Norms because they truly are what you believe in, not just what everyone else says is right, then who's to say that just because it is a Norm that it is   right  ?  Ooh .. long sentence. Sorry. :o)    Humans being humans vary greatly, and frankly, I find the rigid rules of society to be unfairly unaccomodating. After all, who is to say that sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander? Yes, yes, I know, the idiom  originally  means something else, but really, who is to say that sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander .. unless, of course, the gander himself says so! lol .. Me and my convoluted theories ..     This is plainly illustrated in the movie. To the girls, getting married is the ultimate ambition, Ms Watson tells them no, it isn't and it shouldn't be, but one of the girls then discovers that yes, it can be because it is   what I believe in  and most importantly,  it is what I  want .     This is my whole point, that society's ideals shouldn't influence what we, personally, hold ideal. Too many times I see people aspiring to be something society tells them to be, what society tells them they should be. I find it sad, and more than a little infuriating .. but most especially with the people who perpetuate the vicious cycle!     *Argh! Don't even get me  started  on the so-called "Pillars" and "Creme de la Creme" of Society! Exemplars my @$$!! I've never seen a bunch of more self-serving, self-important, self-absorbed Herd of Cattle my entire (23-and-a-half years of) life!!! If they are what society, in general, should aspire to, then it is in my humble opinion that society is going down the drain.*    Hmm.. maybe not so humble after all. So much for my resolution to be less judgemental this year.     No, I don't hold in high regard society's ideals nor public opinion, because ultimately, you are the one who has to live with yourself the most. It's not like you have much of a choice anyways, so why be something you're uncomfortable being, or more importantly, someone you're not? I realise what I have to say next may come across as sounding selfish, but I can't live my life for other people. Why should I work so hard at pleasing other people instead of working to please me? I'm no less important than everybody else, and if I don't please me, then who will? Moreover, if I am not pleased with myself, then how can other people be pleased with me?    Call a rogue a rogue? :o) I believe in self-preservation: preservation of my own happiness, preservation of my sanity, and preservation of my principles, integrity and individuality. If my ideals happen to conform to societal norms, so be it; and if they don't, then So. Be. It. I'm making myself happy. Not to the exclusion of others, of course. I am not so self-absorbed! lolz .. But I've learned that I am the only one who can be depended on to take care of Me.    *Ahem* Back to the 'slumber party'. :oD We finally dropped off to sleep at about 3.30am .. slept like logs. I have no idea if I snored, but I was so tired I don't remember dreaming at all. Next thing I knew, Intan came in after being awake hours before we finally woke and Min was verbally dragging me out of bed.     Lunch with the girlygirls was super fun! It was officially in honour of Huda's birthday, but did we ever need a reason to have fun?? :oD lolz ... Still, an early Happy Birthday to Huda! OoOoooOoOOooh .. and the food was superb .. *yum*    My only .. "regret" .. was not being able to go window shopping. :o( lol! I have happily found a new shopping 'kaki'. Finally, one who will be able to match me step-by-millionth-happy-step in the quest for the perfect .. whatever! lolz .. Again, do we really need a reason to have fun? Heheee .. Takpe. Next Saturday we'll go to Ratu with Auntie Arfah .. then we can visit the British India kat GEM, ok Intan? *awaiting the arrival of Saturday with devilish glee*

You believe in love:  YES.  Absolutely.     The People You Know   The Weirdest: Joshua. Josh is lovely! .. but still weird. :o)  The Loudest: Me? *blush* No, Harry.

      My internal clock has been severely tampered with. I find myself dozing off for 1/2 hour naps when I should be eating lunch, drifting zombie-like around the house at 10am, and wolfing down a bowl Hazelnut Squares and milk at 1:19am. *slurp*     Day and night no longer have meaning. I find myself doing the laundry at 4am, and having to severely repress the urge to practise my violin at 3am.     I need a loooooooooong break! What I want is, at the very least, a whole week just for me.     I want to get a full-body massage, and I want to catch up on all those movies I missed all on the same day. (Movie marathon! Anyone with me? *G*)     I want to laze by the sea (failing which, I'll settle for a pool) and do nothing more than flip over every so often so as to even out my tan.     I want to spend a small fortune at MPH and Kinokuniya, catching up on a year's worth of reading.    I want to get my hair cut. It's looong past due. I look like Shaggy's sister.    I want to go see the TePapa's Lord of the Rings Exhibition, but I don't want to go to Singapore. I am torn. Yes, my boycott of Singapore is still in effect. Half a year and it has diminished not an ounce. But I first found out about this exhibition almost 2 years ago, and have been waiting to see it ever since. My argument for going is that I've been wanting to go waaaay before I even met the Reason which gave rise to the Great Singapore Boycott, and my argument for abstaining is that the thought of Singapore is  still  too painful for me. I lost something extremely valuable, something absolutely irreplaceable to Singapore, and I'll never be able to forgive, much less forget, not if I lived to be a thousand years old. So, to go, or not to go? That is the question.  ~ My most profound apologies to Shakespeare for murdering his prose     I want to have a nice night out with the girls. The  Girlygirls.   ~ Min, despite the porn-connotations, you've Named us, and I suppose we're stuck with it! lolz..      I want to get in touch with old, long-lost friends.     I want to be happy, to be loved and to give love in return. It may sound cliched, but there's a reason why some things are so often said.    Most of all, I want to wake up one day and say to myself, "I want nothing more, I have everything I could possibly need."

      Whither doth Time fly?    How quickly time seems to pass of late.     It seems like only a while ago that I first nervously walked to my first day of Engineering Maths, when in actuality it has been four years since.     It seems like just last week I walked out of my final paper, when it has really been almost two months since.     It seems like just a short time ago that all alone, I first boarded the plane which would take me to Kuala Terengganu, and only shortly after that said tearful farewells in Kemaman, where I left my heart, not knowing if I would ever return. It has been more than a year since. Yet, the memory is so fresh.    Where has all that time in between gone?    Maybe it's an indication of my getting older. I find that things are rarely ever remembered in chronological order anymore. All the memories are jumbled up, like pictures in a giant shoe box, to be picked up and looked at at random. I rarely ever remember  when  the memory was, I only remember it as it happened. Fond recollections of twelve years ago feel like it only just happened yesterday.    Just before writing this, I was remembering singing Christmas carols in the middle of June with Bern. Due to  Hari Merdeka  celebrations dance practise, there were no classes. Ben and I sang like it was nobody's business. I think we were in Standard 6. I remember it like it was only yesterday.  *smile*     I also remember that when I was younger, time seemed to pass at a more breatheable pace.      "You can wear make-up when you're sixteen."    "Sixteen??!?!?!!! That's, like, five whole years from now!!!"     :o)    Weeks would take forever to end. A week  was  a week! Now, a week is  only  seven days, which pass by in a flash. Gosh, it used to be that I could accomplish soooooo much in a week, but of late, a week is more often than not insufficient time to get anything done at all!    Were the things I had to do then more important than the things I have to do now? When I was younger, nothing was serious, and everything was important. Now, everything is serious, but nothing feels important enough.    Perhaps children really should rule the world.  *winkz*

        WARNING: INCOHERENT RANT AHEAD!!      So, I've been at this Accounting Seminar for 2 days .. and am extremely miffed!  Apesal dengan orang Melayu nih?  Humility is all and good, and sometimes, so is being self-effacing and modest, but these people take it to new heights! Being in this seminar with 19 other Malay 'entrepreneurs' has tested my tolerance for such things almost to the limit!     Nobody  wants to do anything first. Okay lah, I'm like that too, but when asked to do something, come on, you have to get out there and do it the best you can. Thing is,  nobody  here seems like their even bothering to try!!    Okay lah, not  everybody . In a class of 20, I can only think of .. 6 people who have confidence enough to do anything. But of the 6, two of them are soooo adamant that whatever they're saying is right .. when in actual fact, half of what they say is completely inaccurate. The rest of it is pure bollocks. They are both men. This will be ranted on a bit later, but henceforth, all mentions of 'everybody' will refer to the rest of the class, including the Two Idiots.     Apesal dengan Melayu nih?  They are so afraid to put out an opinion, and sometimes when their suggestion is voted out by the group, they completely shut down and clam up for the rest of the session.  Macam mana lah dia boleh jadi entrepreneur?  How do they survive the supposedly dog-eat-dog business world? And not only that,  kulit nipis lak tu. Cakap sikit, melenting. Tegur sikit, merajuk. Kalau orang suruh dia buat macam tu, macam tuuuuu je lah.  *Sigh*     Was it because our generation was brought up differently? Or is it geography, that the way our parents brought us up is the result of them living in the city/kampung/hulu-tempat-jin-bertendang? Nak kata they are from a different generation pun, it doesn't seem a plausible excuse. (A handful of them are my mum's age, 50s, and others in their 30s with a few of us 20-somethings.) After all, my mum isn't a cowed mouse. She brought us up the way we turned out, after all!      Tak tahu lah. Nak kata  only the Melayu are like this is not totally accurate. Yet, you kind of notice that it's  mostly  the Malays who possess this characteristic. It is highly evident in the products of  sekolah asrama , most especially - and most frustratingly - in the girls.     I would not call myself a feminist. I don't go around burning my bras. I  love  my bras. They make me feel so incredibly feminine, a feeling which I relish in. But whenever I don't feel like wearing one, well, I don't wear it. So what of other people's opinion? Some might say it's actually UNfeminine, that it's indecent. It's not like I'd go around in a super-transparent top when I'm not wearing a bra, and hey, I am a Woman, and nobody knows more about being feminine than Me. Besides, nobody has any right to assert any unsolicited opinions about Me on me.    Which brings me to my second rant: Why the F*ck does any woman allow any man to assert his dominance over her? Being  obedient  and  respectful  to your husband, father, uncle, elders, etc. is one thing. Allowing men to bully you is a wholly separate matter!!    Like these Two Idiots at the seminar. What in Hell makes them think that just because God gave them penises that it meant God gave them the right to Always Be Right? Maybe they  do  have extra brains stored in their little winkers. It is, perhaps, unfortunate that it is their dominant brain. Or maybe that one got shoved up their ass.    Like, really! *Huff* They give unsolicited opinions ( kalau betul pun takpe. Nih semua merepek  and totally inaccurate!), butt in whenever someone (usually a woman) is asking a question .. and worse, butt in with totally unnecessary and irrelevant interjections whenever someone (again, usually a woman) is  answering  a question! This goes far beyond being nosy and egoistical, it's downright rude! Almost overbearingly rude!    And what gives men the right to preside over women?  Yelah , what it says in the Quran and all about men leading women, but should an incompetent man be allowed to lead more able and more competent women? Should a man who  thinks  he knows what he's doing be allowed to overrule women who know  exactly  what they're doing .. and doing it right! Why should we allow a  bahlol  to be the 'leader' by virtue of his  accidental  physical attributes???    I am not sexist. I don't believe women should always be right, or the leader. Things should be based on certain qualities, the criteria for which should be decided by the kind of situation faced. What it should not be based on are things like gender, seniority, and  pangkat .    On the first day, the facilitator asked the class to elect a 'head', someone for the organizers to liase with. One woman was nominated, based on her making contact with every member of the group, eventhough we had only been there 3 hours. She was nominated, and elected by an almost unanimous vote. Did you know what the facilitator then did? He asked if the men weren't interested in being the Head instead. There were only 3 men present, including the husband of Elected Head. No, the group was happy with the decision. The other two men weren't interested? he asked again, almost plainitively. One shook his head outright, and said that he voted for Elected Head. "You, Helmy? Boleh? Boleh?" the Facilitator begged, almost on his knees. Biggest Idiot simpered and smiled and heh-heh-heh-ed, displaying all his tar-stained Chiclet bits, and said, "Boleeeeeeeeh, laaaaaaa...." Okay! Facilitator exclaimed, humour completely restored! Idiot Helmy can be the  Ketua , and you at the back can be his deputy.     WTF? So much for asking the class to  elect  one! More importantly, that veto would not have happened had the elected been a man. I dare anybody to refute that. It was blatant sexism! Unfortunately, I remembered to mind my manners, and it was not polite to condemn organizers of the seminar upon the first meeting, I held my tongue. Anyway, we completely ignored Idiot Helmy, and all matters were directly addressed to the Woman Deputy. No, from the very beginning he did not impress us much. He continued .. and still continues! .. on in this vein, making him the Least Popular Participant. The dick. It doesn't help either that he's got the most  gatal  leer I've ever seen on a Malay man. He makes my skin crawl! *shivers*    *Sigh*    Yes, I know not all Malays are like this. I know not all Men are like this. They are not Men, they are Assholes - a totally separate species. I know not all Malay men are like this, ditto all Malay women. I have been extremely fortunate with regards to the people I meet and interact with. I know many intelligent and personable Malay men and women, regardless of their level of education. I also thank God that I know more intelligent people than I know meek, unthinking idiots. I think I would expire from frustration otherwise!    The seminar ends tomorrow, after final group presentations. Despite the fact that I don't have any formal training in Accountancy (barring Form 3 KH, of course), the seminar wasn't too difficult.     Oh, a little about the group presentations. We were divided into 4 groups of five, and Mr. Idiot Helmy was in mine. We were told to elect a Leader, this time by a very nice lady instructor, and guess who immediately began proceedings and delegating tasks, as if it was  only natural  that he was the leader. As was  only natural  this pissed me off to no end. (No surprise there..) I curtly reminded (nobody - and everybody - in particular) that we still had not elected a Leader. He blinked a few times, blinked a bit more, and while he blinked like a startled rabbit, I asked if there were any nominations. No? Not one? Nobody? (BTW, all the other team members are women.) They blinked at me a few times, said nothing, but nervously glanced En. Idiot Helmy's way. His face visibly unfroze and a melted smile gradually made a widening pool across his  ham sap  face. By then, I knew a little more about the other women to be able to push a few limits. I said, that well, since there were no nominees, I would like to nominate myself.     Heads and eyes whipped back in my direction, and after a few incredulous stares from the other ladies, they started smiling, and nodded their assent. I (tried) to smile sweetly at the quiet declarations of  "I setuju."  from the other ladies. It was a clear 4-to-1 majority vote. One jaw dropped, shut with a snap, gave me an oily smile, and said not a word.     Yes, I was the youngest, and yes, I had a lot of nerve, but at least I was balancing  my  spread sheets right. Little triumphs feel just as good.    ..... Hmmm, maybe I do like politics after all. ;o)

      Today, I found myself being unable to focus - as in  really  focus - on anything. My thoughts have been running in erratic tangents all day long. I don't even know why I'm bothering to write today. Maybe it's another erratic tangent .. off .. something .......    Was craving for pizza 3 days straight. So today, right after work, at 10pm, I rushed to Pizza Hut, Lucky Garden, in the hopes that it was still open. Happy chance had it open till 11pm! Yay! So I bought a 9" Cheese-Stuffed Crust Hawaiian Chicken and a Pan-Crust Chicken Supreme, to  go . When we  got  (home), guess who gobbled down all of  the Cheese-Stuffed Crust Hawaiian Chicken, save one tiny slice? *Sigh* My only excuse was that I was  starving  and the craving only exacerbated the hunger. Glutton-like, I know, but it's not as if anybody else was eating it .... *G* As repentance, I shall put in a thorough workout at the gym tomorrow.     IF  I wake up, that is. lolz ...    Hmm .. another train of thought: as   urlLink Intan   recently brought up, why is it that we women need to be thin to feel beautiful? Rather, why do we need to  feel  thin to feel beautiful? As is sometimes the case, thin women feel that they aren't thin enough, therefore suffer some sort of inferiority complex.     Is it because the glossies tell us 'Thin is In'? Is it the fault of fashion moguls who hire only sticks to model their rags? Or do we blame (gasp!) men, who, in the end, are ultimately who we're  really  trying to please?    Girls, let's be honest. We  all , without exception, want to look nice and sexy for our men. And more often than not, sexy = thin = sexy. This game of animal attraction, I believe, is only a natural instinct. Nature's way of ensuring future generations and all .. lolz!    But it's always made me wonder: why should being sexy have anything at all to do with being thin? And let's  all  be honest now. Sure you might think the woman is sexy just the way she is, but can any of you really deny she'd be a whole lot sexier if she lost a few pounds?     I am not suggesting men should be blamed for this. Hardly! I'm just stating a fact. Again I ask the question: Who put these ideals of beauty in our heads? Man or woman, it hardly matters. We all have more or less the same picture of what ideal beauty should look like. Superficially.    Nowadays, beauty (snort) mags harp on and on about how one should be more accepting of one's physical condition. That the real beauty lies  inside  of you. I don't disagree with the message, for in a way, I believe it to be true .. but sometimes it's hard to remember it all when on the opposite page is a huge colour ad for Slimming Sanctuary/Expressions/Marie France "Find the True You!" slimming programs. Those with spokespeople who endorse feeling grrrrrreat about themselves after they've lost 30kgs and 1000 cms off their butts/thighs/upper arms. Those who attest to now having more confidence (!!) in themselves now that they are sticks, as opposed to feeling suicidally depressed when they were fat .. especially after giving birth, which is only supposed to be one of the most euphoric events of a woman's life. But no. Being thin makes you feel sooo much better than bringing a new life into the world.    With one camp harping on about "Being Fat is Phat! Just be You!" and the other banging on about the confidence-boosting properties of slimming, it's no wonder that our generation is so confused. I am certainly not immune. So what do I do? I believe that I Am What and Who I Am, despite my physical appearance, but if I Were Slim, well, that'd be grrrrrrreat! *Oy, am I in a sarcastic mood tonight!* So I eat what I want, coz I know I'm beautiful inside, then,  alamak!! Besok kena pergi gym, nih!!! Diet! Diet! Diet!  We are the confused generation.  Adoi, pening kepala otak gua..     .. What the hell was I talking about?!?!! lolz .. I took a really short break just to stretch, and the train (of thought) was cataclysmically derailed! Okay, I'll take that as a sign of enough being enough. *chuckles*     At the end of the day, however, I think that perhaps we'll ultimately realise how superficial it all is. When you're old and wrinkled and sagging, and when sex is haaaardly an option anymore, it will finally truly sink in just how superficial physical beauty is. Until then, however, the confusing quest for Beauty goes on! lolz ... Maybe it's just me. I'm the seeing-is-believing sort of person, and although I know the theory of some things, it won't really sink in until I've experienced it. I can be stubborn that way. :o)     Will be away at an Accountings Course for 4 days. Yes, Accounting. My mum is sending her admin person for it and there was an extra space. I thought, what the hell. I might as well go. You'll never know when that skill might come on handy .. ;o) Wish me un-boredom!

       Mungkinkah bila ku bertanya    Pada bintang-bintang, Dan bila ku merasa Bahasa       Kesunyian.    Sadarkah aku yang berjalan    Dalam kehampaan? Terdiam, terpana, terbata semua dalam       Keraguan.    Aku dan semua yang terluka    Karena       Kita.    Aku kan menghilang    Dalam pekat malam Lepas ku melayang.    Biarlah ku bertanya    Pada bintang-bintang Tentang Arti Kita Dalam Mimpi Yang Sempurna.    "Mimpi Yang Sempurna" ~ Peter Pan     As  he  keeps reminding me,  he's  engaged. Sometimes, I think  he's  reminding  himself . Sometimes, I  hope   he's   berating himself .   Sometimes, I think I'm too wistfully hopeful.   Sometimes, I think I cause my own heartbreak.    This was the song he sang for me last. It sounded like GoodBye.

        "Eh, Jas. Apesal you suka dating orang tua, hah?"      So, in response to this oft asked question ...      10 Reasons Why Jas Like Older Men   (or 10 Dalil Jas Minat Lelaki .. err .. Matang! Haha!)      1. Older Men are more  mature.  Like, duh, but you get what I mean. They tend to be more open - and open-minded - for one ..     2. Older Men know what they want .. more often than not.    3. Older Men are more confident.    4. Older Men don't play games. When they do, they're usually quite challenging, which is better, I suppose, than the childish sort. Hey, they might as well be stimulating! Eh heh. *winkz*     5. Older Men don't beat around the bush.  *Ahem*  Figuratively speaking.    6. Older Men tend to have left their juvenile sense of male humour behind them. Well, most of them do, anyways.    7. Older Men know how to treat women! *Purrrrr..*    8. Older Men know how to  woo  women .. properly!! *Double purrrrrrr..*    9. Older Men, having been through a lot more, tend to have a finer appreciation of things, and thereby take less things for granted.    10. And perhaps most importantly, Older Men are less insecure, thereby resulting in:   *  him not calling you every other hour  "just because (he) misses you" , which irritates the hell out of me. No, it is NOT sweet!! It's irritating!   *  him not pouting and  merajuk-ing  just because you didn't call to wish him "Good Night". Oh brother!   *  him not throwing a hissy fit because you decided to go out with other male friends just this once instead of with him.   *  him not accusing you for not loving him enough because you  did  decide to go out with said friends.   *  him not thinking he's losing you to one of said male friends, because you chose to go out with them instead of with him, therefore you don't love him anymore! *sob!* *roll eyes*    God, deliver me from men like these!     No, see, that's the difference. Those  aren't  men! lolz. :o)    I know what I don't want. I may not know exactly what I want, but I've dated enough to know what I don't like.    Thing is, I like my independence. Those who really know me know just how fiercely independent I can be. Maybe that's why at the ripe old age of 24 I've never been anything but single. lolz. Not that I mind. It's better than being in a restrictive relationship. I need one that lets me breathe, that lets me grow. I don't need to be stifled. I'd rather be alone that stifled.    And to be fair, I wouldn't mind if the man is just as independent as me. Being loving is one thing, and it's totally separate from being independent. Haha .. as some of those I've dated can attest, I can be quite the  manja  one. Hehe. Don't be surprised. *winkz* The point is, it doesn't compromise my need for space one bit. Even in a relationship, some personal space is  good . The glue that binds it all is a healthy dose of communication, understanding, and a good measure of trust.       * Disclaimer:   All contents of this blog entry are based on the  personal  dating experiences of the author.

      Alloz!    Back from yet another weekend trip! Went over to Singapore *grumbles. bloody singapore. no. singapore AN * over Friday night and Saturday just for the TePapa's Lord of the Rings exhibition at the Singapore Science Centre. (Ooooh! Alliteration! Well, sort of..)    Yep, you read right. My sister, Nadia, and I travelled out of the country just for an exhibition. But it wasn't just  any  exhibition, it was the  TePapa's Lord of the Rings  exhibition!! And we've only been planning the trip for close to two years now .. therefore, we couldn't possibly miss it! *G* Also, when you think about it, it's only an 8-hour, 400km train ride away, so ....    Yep, it was a mini-adventure, all right. We took the night train to S'pore so we would arrive at 8am all fresh and ready to roll. Then while waiting for the exhibition to open, I insisted on visiting the Chinese Gardens, so off we went! I've become rather interested in bonsai of late, and this detour was definitely pre-meditated! Hee hee ...    Admission into the Chinese Gardens is free, but I happily forked over the small fee for admission into the Bonsai Garden. It was awesome! Alright, being new to the .. erm .. hobby, I've only had the chance to see, at most, 4 trees in one sitting. This time, I got to see a whole garden-full of magnificent specimens! It's sometimes silly what passions can do to you, but I was almost overwhelmed! Rows upon rows of perfectly shaped trees, beautiful compositions, and a truly amazing collection of  suiseki . Wonderful! I probably could have stayed there a few hours more, had not a certain companion developed achy feet. *pout* Ah well. I suppose it was just as well, as it was well nigh approaching noon and we were there for the LotR exhibition anyways. But I definitely will have to make my way there the next time.  If  there will  be  a next time. *grumbles. bloody singaporeAN*    The MRT stop for the Science Centre was only a short hop and a skip away. Okay, maybe not. But it  was  only one stop away.     (Break for a little ramble here.)  I   love   the Singapore Public Transport System! It's soooo convenient, sooooo efficient, and most importantly, soooooo comfortable! I tell you, if we had this in KL, I'd've gotten rid of my car looooong ago. Well, maybe not, coz I really really really love my car, but I would definitely use PT more often! Malaysia could learn a lot from S'pore with regards to this. A   LOT  . I've got enough reasons to hate S'pore, but this one thing, I absolutely love.   (Ok. Ramble over.)     Now, where was I? Oh, yes. Before we knew it, we were at the Science Centre!! Wheeee! I positively skipped down the driveway to the entrance! We had arrived!!    Admission was S$20. Oooooow-wie! But more than happily spent. And of course, before even paying the admission fee, we had to do a spot of Souvenir window-shopping! Tee hee. Surveying what was worth getting our grubby hands on.     Unfortunately, we were somewhat disappointed at the rather limited selection of souvenirs on sale. Can you believe there were no T-shirts for sale??!!?!! Who's ever heard of an exhibition souvenir-store with no T-shirts for sale?!?!!!! I was so hoping to get a cute baby-sized one for  LittleSumo . Imagined him as a pint-sized Legolas .. or with Sauron's Eye on his little, round baby belly.     Fortunately, however, the souvenirs weren't  too  pricey, so we were able to get more than enough for them back home who weren't able to, or didn't want to follow us. It was a good exercise in stretching our budget, but I say we succeeded admirably! But yes, yes, sense did kick in. We bought them goodies only  after  we had completed the tour. Our self-restraint was amazing. Pats on the back all around. *G*    The exhibition itself was totally amazing. We got to see some of the actual costumes (i.e. Aragon, Arwen, Legolas, Elrond, etc.), most (if not all!) the amazing weaponry, the conceptual designs, and most fascinatingly how the movie was made. I thought it was an extremely detailed exhibition. Highly educational (in an artsy sense, I mean), not to mention entertaining!! Also, it was fascinating to see how an object of art (i.e. the movie) is actually the result of extremely, minutely precise technical processes! So much for art being art and science being science. The borders for those are becoming extremely blurry, as this exhibition proved.    What most interested me (and had me viewing every tape concerning it) were the ultra-special effects. It was utterly mind-blowing how they achieved that forced-perspective thingy .. how did these people come up with the ideas of how to do it  that  way to achieve  this  in the first place?!?!! Sheer genius, I tell you!!    It was absolutely amazing. Truly amazing! It may have been just three 3-hour movies to the audience, but the exhibition gave such insight into the amount of hard work and brain power that went into producing such fine movies in the first place. We've perhaps become jaded towards movies, not putting any consideration as to the effort that was put into producing one, therefore wonderful as the LotR Trilogy was, to most of us, it's still *shrug* Just Another Movie.    Perhaps it  was  Just Another Movie, but it was also someone's (in this case, Peter Jackson's) dream. It was also someone's passion, someone's inspiration and motivation. And when you then begin to realise as you progress through the exhibition, that the movies were the product of not just one man's dream, but the dreams and imaginations of the hundreds other people who were involved in producing the movies, you become .. humbled. These people had a dream .. and they achieved it magnificently, in garangtuan proportions. It may have been Just Another Movie, but it gave direction and purpose to their lives. It's better than having nothing to look forward to, and they are fortunate enough to see one of their Life's Purposes fulfilled. I don't believe that kind of Beauty can be bought.    It was truly wonderful. My only complaint is that we weren't allowed to take any pictures!!! *grumbles*    After that, Nadia and I ran rampant through the other permanent exhibitions at the Science Centre. (The admission fee for the LotR exhibition was inclusive of admission to the Science Centre.) The exhibitions were designed more towards the education of the smaller folk (read: children,  NOT  dwarves and/or hobbits!!) so they were extreeeeemely child-like. As if that would stop us! lolz! We romped and ramped and crawled and spun round and round like the best of them. I think we scared a few kids. lol.     All in all, it was a truly .. educational day. :o) Educational without compromising on the fun. It was a really fun day.    The part which gets me almost laughing out loud whenever I think about it, however, is that we went for a 1-day trip .. to Singapore ... with only ONE  half-filled (!!) backpack .. AND on a shoestring budget. Seriously. We calculated our estimated expenditures and brought what we thought would be just enough to buy some souvenirs, to pay for MRT and bus fares, and to buy lunch and dinner. Amazingly, we survived! More amazingly, we brought *exactly* the right amount of money! I think we came home with less than S$10 between us. Amazing.    I can hardly believe I travelled with only one half-filled backpack! And that I lacked for absolutely nothing! In fact, some things I could have even left at home! Not much of an achievement, but it's something I never thought I'd've been able to do .. but I did it!    And I never thought that I would find myself one day brushing my teeth and washing my face in the public toilet of a railway immigration building .. but I did!     ... they may not count for much now, but I believe the little achievements go a long way. Moreoever, I've learned more things about myself throughout the course of this trip; increasing my limits, and understanding the human nature better. There aren't many lessons more valuable than those.

      I'm back!!!    Redang was, as always, beautiful. I've truly lost track of the number of times I've visited the place, but everytime I go, it claims another little piece of my heart. This time was no different. My little paradise on Earth. I came home with a gorgeous tan and a few phone numbers (a couple of which I  really  wanted), so I can't say it was an entirely disappointing weekend. *Tee hee*     Also came back with an education as to how things almost fall into your lap when you're a woman in a bikini. Tsk tsk, I guess there really is a reason as to why stereotypes exist. Men really  do  think with their heads  *ahem*  .. which also brings a certain element of danger to the games I play. Isyh, isyh, isyh ... I've been good at handling situations so far, but sometimes I do wonder if my luck will one day run out. Freaky .. but it's just so much   fun  .    However, while Redang was good, the rest of the vacation wasn't. Lots of things were said .. lots of issues provoked .. lots of emotions running high, mainly mine. While I am not typically the most emotional person around, this time, things got rough. For me. Mostly. If there had been 8 dwarves, I'd have been Weepy.    I remember a time when I felt generally happy, with the occasional upset. I remember such a time, but I can't remember in the slightest what it felt like. The situation now seems totally reversed: this huge, gaping void with the occassional, brief glimmer of laughter.     Rain, rain on my face, It hasn't stopped raining for days. My world is a Flood. Slowly I become One with the Mud.  "Flood" ~ Jars of Clay

      The presentation went .. not too well. *Glum* Fortunately, though, the examiner wasn't too cruel ... adjustments need to be made before I can hand over the final report, but ah well.    Needless to say, this makes me feel frustrated. I so desperately need to move on! For the past couple of years or so, I've been completely stuck in a rut. It's this sense of complete .. aimlessness, and lack of  doing  (something, anything!) has been on the verge of driving me completely out of my mind! I am just so tired and utterly bored of school.     Truly told, I would have quit a year ago had I not gone for my industrial training. The training stint was a real eye-opener. It was then that I discovered that I would love working as an engineer. It showed me that all that seemingly useless information I was absorbing in class truly  did  have some point to it, that it wasn't just random, aimless babble.     I suppose that's the difference to me. When I was able to physically apply all that knowledge, there was a sense of accomplishment, which was fulfilling. Just knowing it all without seeing it's implementation seemed totally pointless to me .. and that irritated me and frustrated me to no end. Knowledge, if it cannot be utilised, is essentially useless. And uselessness is most definitely a strong pet peeve of mine.    In a sense, it was my saving grace. It's almost a law in this country that if you don't have paper qualifications, then you're next to a Nobody. Wouldn't we all like to do as we please, and have equal opportunities for all? Equal opportunities, my ass. It doesn't exist here. Without that piece of paper, you don't really have that much of a chance in most places. *Sigh* I seriously don't know what I would have done had I not gone for my industrial training. I'm grateful for the direction it gave me, and the resolve to just complete my final year so I can get a job later.     It's funny how almost everyone tells me to enjoy being a student now as I'll probably hate having to work later. Thing is, I hate being a student now! How much worse could having to work be?!?!! lol. No, I loved working, and am really looking forward to it. Perhaps it is simply the novelty of doing something new. This enthusiasm will probably wear off when working becomes more routine and is driven more by necessity rather than enjoyment. Then again, perhaps not. I know a few people who are quite similar to my temperament and they pick working hands down over being a student. lolz .... Well,  que sera sera , what will be, will be. If I get bored, I'm sure I'll find a way to reinvent my life. *winkz*    I'll be going to Redang Saturday morning! Yahoo! I absolutely cannot wait! As such, this will probably be my last entry .. well, for the next 5 days, anyways. Hee hee. I'll be back Tuesday. Until then, it's sand, surf and sun time!!! Wheeeee!

      I apologize for yesterday's entry ending so abruptly. My computer went bonkers and I only just managed to save what I could. It kept shutting down due to a code error of some sort .. I haven't the slightest idea what went wrong. Only hope there won't be a repeat performance today.    *Sigh* How is it that computers are now an almost indispensible tool, yet so many of us remain totally clueless idiots about it? Haha. Excuse me if you don't fall into that category, but I certainly do. I know next to zilch about computers, besides knowing how to use them, and it's so frustrating when something like yesterday happens! *Aaaargh* There was once the hard disk totally crashed and ate a whole semester's hard work's worth of a multimedia project. *Double Aaaaaargh!!* Imagine the slap-dash presentation I managed to scrape together in 2 weeks. What a nightmare!! Well, at least I finally learned the important lesson of backing up. Only now, I'm so paranoid most of the times, I back up twice more than necessary. Eh heh.    I want to go to Ikea for hotdogs. *Yummmm* Chicken sausage (with crunchy skin!) and a lovely bun .. with all the relish you can pile on top of it. *Yummmmmmmmm!!* I love the self-serve topping .. heheeee ... *Triple Yummmm!!!* Unfortunately, it's 1:30am and Ikea closed three-and-a-half hours ago. :o( I'll just have to wait for Friday then. *G*    Tomorrow (well, technically later today, the 6th of May) is my thesis presentation. *Eeeps!* I don't know what to expect at all. I'm quaking in my shoes. *Deep breath*  Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.  I guess I'll just do the best I can. Wish me luck!

      Ehrm. Updating for updating's sake. There isn't really anything to write about, really. Only updating at  urlLink  someone's   behest. :o)    OoooOoOoOooOooOh .. Am looking forward to tomorrow night. FHM's 100 Sexiest Women Party at Zouk. Not so much looking forward to the party as looking forward to checking Zouk out. It just looks sooooo cute!     Strangely, even though it's been open some one-and-a-half months now, I've only managed to get a glimpse of it today. But it's just adorable!! It's (almost literally!) a huge, white bubble of a building .. and the pics in the papers show that the interior is just as adorable as the exterior! Colourful, themed rooms .. lots of colours, swirly bits and bright designs. Lolz .. of course it would appeal to me. I've got this flamboyant-bordering-on-gaudy-if-not-exceeding-it! taste. I prefer to call it .. my natural exuberance. *G*    Funny how a change of words can give things a whole new, different meaning. Nadia was reading my horoscope and she mentioned this bit about my stubbornness, my powers of argument, and how I'm always able to justify my arguments. Eh heh. On many occasions, I've been told I should have become a lawyer, due to my ability to twist things to a favourable point. I'll admit it's fun .. but only when I don't have to do it for a living. lolz .. no, law appeals to me not in the least.    They say Time Heals All Wounds. I've been through that enough times to attest to its truth. Unfortunately, it does nothing to comfort you now, and the present is where we live, not the future. The future is so .. uncertain.

      The Royal London Circus is in town!!! The whole family went to see it today .. and although we went on the premise of wanting to take Fareed (our much beloved two-year-old terror) to see his first circus, I'll have to be honest and admit Nadia and I had waaaaay loads more fun than he did! *G*    There were clowns! There was a trapeze act! They had elephants! There were tigers, lions and death-defying stunts! Gaudy, over-priced souvenirs and snacks galore! We went, we saw, we did it all!! *Although I was wondering: if it is the Royal  London  Circus, how come everyone who came onto the mike had American accents??!?!    Gosh, it brought back so many happy childhood memories. Despite the rain and traffic jam, my spirits refused to be dampened. Fortunately, the rain pattered off to a very slight drizzle by the time we arrived, and as Mum so wonderfully got us A-section tickets, we ended up sitting in the front row! That itself was enough to make me go pop-eyed! And it was only the first two minutes in the Big Tent!!     It was .. magical. There was this indescribable feeling of awe as I sat there looking around. There was all the riggings, the pretty stars painted on the inside of the tent, the rows upon rows of excited children ... I couldn't stop chattering! (Yes, I get extremely vocal when excited .. and/or when I'm sleepy. ;op) With my popcorn in one hand and and cotton candy making my face and fingers all sticky, I was brought back 10 years to my last circus. It made me feel like a child again, with the excitement only a child could feel at being in a circus. It was a wonderful feeling, not remembering the troubles of yesterday and the worries of tomorrow. There was only the here and now .. and the here and now was the circus!!    After a few minutes, the lights dimmed. The anticipation in the tent was palpable. Then, the ringleader finally came out .. and the show BEGAN! The program was nothing anyone over the age of 9 hadn't seen before countless times on TV, but oh, how I ooh-ed and aaah-ed and laughed and cheered and gasped at all the right moments! How Nadia and I yelled right back to the clown all those childish responses, how we laughed from our bellies when he tripped over his own shoes, eventhough it was  obviously  on purpose and we'd seen that tired old act a million times before. We squealed in fright when the lion and tigers roared too suddenly, and we watched gaped-jaw as the trapeze troupe and acrobats twisted, tumbled and somersaulted through the air in gravity-defying turns. We ran with Fareed to pet the little Shetland pony when he was brought out during the intermission, and we were probably the only adults to oh-so-ungracefully clamber atop the elephant for photos. And all the while, we wore those colourful, silly jester hats they were hawking as souvenirs outside.    It was wonderful to be a child again, to enjoy the immense pleasures such simple things can give you. It was all about letting go of adult inhibitions, forgetting for that one moment that you're expected to act a certain way, and think the serious thoughts of a grown-up. It was all about relishing every second of that excitement recalled from childhood. It was not caring whether other adults thought you were being silly, it was being - for that one moment - carefree.    I pitied them, those adults who thought they had to be adults at the circus. They watched the show with glazed eyes, with acid comments of the tired programs, of the dust, of the shabbiness of the clown. They sat in their seats with arms folded across their chests, with stony expressions, waiting to be impressed. They weren't. From start to finish, nothing impressed them. They didn't clap, they didn't sing along, they didn't laugh .. they didn't even smile. They sneered at Nadia's and my gaudy jester hats, they whispered and pointed at us when we went up to take our picture with the elephant. They gave us sidelong glances and hitched their shoulders up at us whenever we whooped with laughter or gasped in awe. They mocked our childlike enthusiasm and laughed at our simple-minded enjoyment. I know because they were sitting right beside me .. and behind me too. And I pitied them.    I pitied them because they didn't know how to enjoy the simpler things. I pitied them because they didn't know that sometimes it is okay to be childish. Most of all, I pitied them because they couldn't laugh for the sake of laughing, that their laughter had to come at someone else's expense. Lolz .. I saw them laughing at me. I don't mind. I was having too much fun to care! I hope they enjoyed it. ;o) There are times when we have to be adults, and there are times when we ought to be children again. Knowing when to be what is the key.    I had a great day. Things haven't exactly been so rosy and sunny in my life for quite a while now, but today was a wonderful day.

      Everything seems so bleak of late. It's like there's an unshakeable cloud of gloom hanging over my head, making life seem so dismal and listless.  I wouldn't call it depression. I don't believe it is that serious. Besides, it's not as if I am totally without some happiness. I feel happiness everytime I see  LittleSumo  smile and laugh. I feel happy for friends who have so much to celebrate: weddings, impending births, graduations, etc. And it's not as if I had to force myself to be happy for them.   I really am sincerely happy for them. Yet, sincere as it is, it is not truly encompassing. It's more like 'specific happiness', or 'assigned happiness'. Whenever I think of them, I feel happy for them, but that happiness doesn't spill into other aspects of my life. Everything else remains gray and lifeless. It's as though my life is a movie played in black and white, with the occasional spurts of coloured scenes interspersed between. Reminiscent of the movie 'Pleasantville', or more accurately, a dysfunctional first-generation colour TV.  I read an article once, some years back, about young adults now experiencing "quarter-life crisis". Is this what it is?  Nowadays, there seems to be a period of crisis for every stage of your life.   First, you have "Birth", where you are expelled from your comfortable, peaceful first home ever into this cold, cold climate where everything is noisy and doesn't make sense.  When you are a toddler, you have your "Terrible Twos Stage", where nothing makes much sense and you try to rationalise it the best you can in order to survive in this world by (reasonable) (adult) standards.  When you grow older, you become a "PreTeen", where you're about to enter teenage-hood, and you don't understand much about that, but you try your best to make it all make sense.  Then there's "Puberty". Let's not even go there.  Previously, only the "Mid-Life Crisis", "Turning 30 *gasp!*" and "Life Begins at 40 (thus labelled to acknowledge the (vain) attempt to console yourself)" syndromes were identified.   Having identified all that, you realise that not much of your life is left crisis-free. The only heretofore unexplained chunks remaining were: childhood, your teens, your twenties, and old age.  In your childhood, nothing made much sense, but who cares? You were too busy having fun playing masak-masak, mermaids, Barbie or kejar-kejar.  In your teens, everything made sense, because you already   know   everything. Naturally. D'uh!  Having said that, is it really any wonder that many adults wish they were either children or teenagers again?  In senile-dodderism, I have a feeling that I'll be too old to care, because I would already know everything, but despite my great wisdom, I would still find that nothing makes sense, but to hell with it all, I want to crochet my doily first, and feed my cat, and, and ... do I have a cat? Wait, where am I? I don't remember ever seeing this sofa befo .. zzZzZzzZZzz .....  So that leaves only your Twenties for you to finally, at at least ONE point in your life, be (relatively) carefree, to understand it all, or maybe accepting that you understand nothing but are at total peace with that, and just to enjoy life as it is, no more, no less.    THEN  they come up with  " urlLink Quarter-Life Crisis "????!!?  Why can't these psychologists leave us the hell alone??!! Must they take  EVERYTHING  away from us?!!!  *sigh*   God, I just decided on the title for this post, and have just realised that  I AM A TWENTYSOMETHING!!  Before I know it, I'll be 30 .. then 40 .. and then I'll have a chin hanging to my boobs, and boobs hanging to my toes!! Oh tidaaaaaaak!!!.....   Seriously, though. For me, it's this feeling of .. restlessness. Of inadequacy. Maybe that's the right word. Inadequate. Everything feels .. lacking, and the harder I try, the more that 'something' eludes me, so much so that I have become so sick of trying and have decided to go the absolute extreme contrary and stubbornly do nothing at all. And perhaps that is the root of the restlessness.  It also seems like I am not the only one. I see my mood(s) reflected in most of my other friends in the same age group, in varying degrees.  Will life actually be easy at some point? Will there ever be a point in my life where I can say, "I have it all, I want for nothing more." Will I ever be able to shake off this bleakness? Will it ever lift? Or will it never go away, and instead gradually, insidiously assimilate itself into my personality, resulting in my becoming more embittered as I grow older.   Is that why old people generally seem so bitter, so sad, so forlorn? Or will Life be more like a wave, where we'll experience highs and lows like the ebbings of the tide?  I was going to say like a sine curve, but that seemed a little engineering-dorkish. What to do? Once a dork, always a dork, I guess. *G*   Will things ever make any sense?!!

      Despite  knowing  the theory behind the Relativity of Time, I still find it fascinating how a 5-hour drive  to  Penang can be so interminably long and tiresome, yet the 5-hour drive back  from  Penang can pass by in almost a blink.  Hmmm.....   I commented on it once, how the journey 'to' always seem longer than the journey back. In response,  MrWonderful  told me that it was because on your way 'to',  malaikat s and other celestial beings question your motives for the journey every step of the way.   "Where are you going? What are your motives? What are your intentions?"  Err ... okay. I more or less thought that it was mainly due to the anticipation of arriving somewhere that made the journey 'to' so restless, as opposed to the restfulness of the 'event' being over with which makes the trip back seem shorter, but I could be wrong.  *cheek!*  I just bear in mind that  MrWonderful   is  the product of a  sekolah agama  secondary school education, so it's hardly surprising he'd hear things like this.   Not that I completely disregard what he said (and nor am I dissing  sekolah agama s!). The sentiment is good, and it's always good to question and to be aware of what your motives are for doing something. However, I can't help but be a  teensy weensy  bit skeptical. Blame it on the urbanite in me. I wasn't exactly brought up believing heavily in the World of the Unseen. It's something which exists on the fringes of my world. But. Yeah.  This time, however, I happen to know exactly why the trip 'to' was longer than the trip back. On the trip 'to', I sat (okay, more like sprawled) in the back, drifting in and out of sleep the whole time, with no idea of how much time and distance had elapsed between one moment of bleary wakefulness and the next.  For those who don't know, I am a bad car-traveller. The worst part about long distance travel by car is the fact that I have nothing to do, coz reading in the car makes me nauseous. I travel badly by car and plane. Oddly though, I'm fine in trains and ships. Even more strangely (or maybe not *winkz*), I never minded long-distance drives with  MrWonderful . Those were Events and Quality Time to look forward to. ;o)    The trip back, however, was ridden out in the front seat, occupied by discussion (one might be tempted to call it near-argument) with  MrMucho   (whom I must now refer to as   Dr Mucho , congratulations honey!)  on the societal-discrimination vs self-discrimination of Homosexual Men and Women, but mostly Men  (because Straight Men do not seem to find the idea of women kissing as repugnant (hell, some even fantasize about it!) as men kissing, hence the greater censure, but that is a different discussion altogether and has no effect on the topic at hand, so we shall leave it at this for now.. My, aren't we wordy! ;op)   Not going too deeply into all that (it  was  a 5-hour drive, after all!), it led towards further discussion/arguement into the quest for acceptance, straight vs gay relationships  (his argument: being allowed to legally marry makes it easier for straight people to have relationships than it is for gay people to have relationships because being able to legally marry makes the relationship bonds stronger. WTF? Commitments are commitments, legal certificates notwithstanding. Apparently, this is not true for gay men. Being allowed legal marriages allows for better relationship foundations. I think it's just a convenient excuse for not committing. Gay men are  still  men, after all. *winkz*) , and a whole host of other things.   But what it mainly boiled down to was me insisting that fundamentally, every human (man, woman, he/she, she/he, gay, straight, datuk, tengku makhota, you name it) is equal and deserves - and should be accorded - every fundamental right, and that all distinctions and discriminations should be ignored and done away with (   Note :  By 'discrimination' here I am merely meaning the difference created, not its other, more adverse meaning ) whereas he maintained that gay people were different that straight people, even fundamentally. Either I am wrong, or he did not really consider the fact appropriately down to its true fundamentals.  He is proud that he is gay and different; different from straight people as well as from other gay people who think that being gay is all about slutty-sleeping-around, no such thing as long-term relationships, etc. While it is good to have personal pride, I wonder if it is all that great if it continues in this vein. By pride, I am not talking about vanity. I suppose it's more an issue of self-respect.   It baffles me that people can be proud of being different. When you  think  yourself different, you  make  distinctions and you create boundaries, and this in turn, I believe, gives room for dissention.   Now, I'm no Conformist myself, but I'm not exactly  proud  of it. Nor am I ashamed of it. It's not even regardable as an accomplishment, it just  is . Things are the way they are, regardless of common-held beliefs and rules. Firstly, beliefs are highly individual, nobody could - nor should - tell you what to believe. Secondly, Rules are created by humans and are never absolute. Heck, some of them might not even be right, so I rarely even bother paying attention to them (except for traffic rules, coz I don't want to pay saman. But even then, I ignore them sometimes. Haha!). Ah well. But like I said, beliefs are highly individual. I might just be delusional. Each to her own.  But I still insist that every human is the same, fundamentally. *winkz*  ~@~  All that being said, I wonder sometimes if all these philosophical ramblings and discussions are pointless. People sit and discuss and argue and rant and rave over all things 'philosophical', feeling puffed up and important over their own superior intelligence .. and you wonder what the real outcome really is, if one actually exists. What is philosophy, truly?  I think it's all egotism. It's all about people who need to feel important discussing 'something' while they are, in actual fact, discussing nothing. Over-inflated self-sense of superior intelligence. Like the Mensa society. What a bunch of pompous asses! Haha!  Apologies to any supporters of Mensa, but these are just my (not so) humble opinions, and this  is , after all, my (not so) private rant page. *winkz*  Seriously though, it's true if you think about how the idea for Mensa bourne out of spite by this one man who couldn't get into some university, the reasons for its formation no longer seem so noble.  Which university was it? Oxford? Cambridge? Harvard? Yale?  Talk about a case of sour grapes. What's more, it creates more division!  More  discrimination! Boycott Mensa! Hehee. *lolz*  Having said all that, I shall be the first to admit that yes, I am one of those people who sits and think I think big thoughts. I am a pompous, egoistical windbag! Haha!  Better to mengaku dulu before anyone else hentam kita! *G*    And yet, being aware of all this, I still sit and ponder on the 'philosophical' workings of our world. I don't believe any of it to be absolute truths, but isn't that what philosophy is all about?   All this shite are the inventions of humans. We, as a species, do tend to drum up a lot of shite, don't we? Yet it is a process which doesn't end until the day we die. I may think up a lot of shite, but pray forgive me. I am, after all, only human. *winkz*

      Went to the Men's Health Readers' Choice Party at Budabar at the pleading of  IpohBoy . Although I was initially reluctant (seeing as how all other mag parties I've attended have been, without exception, the most boring parties ever) I gave in because I'm a softie and can't resist when I'm someone's last resort.  Ehhh??!! Where's your pride, girl?!!!  Well, I wasn't really last resort. I was invited first, declined,  then  I was last resort.   My sister says I caved in because, deep down, I actually sayang him, despite all the ranting and raving over how much he annoys me, but the simple truth is that I can't stand it when people start pleading. I won't budge an inch when people   demand   things of me, but the moment they start pleading, yeesh. I can't bear it! And just to get them to shut up, I give in.    Note to self : Must  learn to say  NO!   Seriously though, I really have to stop giving in to people this way.   Fortunately, this was one time I didn't regret saying No. Not to say the event was the best time I ever had in my life, but it  was  actually entertaining. The venue was one I've been meaning to check out anyway, and despite my misgivings, it more than comfortably accommodated the crowd. Free (good) food too!  Although I found out later that I wasn't supposed to be partaking of the buffet spread as it was reserved for 'special guests'. Hey,  I  think I'm pretty special! Hehe. Nevertheless, the food was happily digesting in my tummy by then, so whatever.  Also, unlike other mag parties, they had a pretty good MC (Paula Malai Ali is sooo boring!) who roused up the crowd pretty well.   Best of all, tho, were the presents! Heeheee! Door gifts were standard. Some Biotherm samples and other bits. What really got me happy-as-a-clam was the RM250 (or so they claim) L'Oreal products I won! By trying to 'seduce' the crowd! *Goes beet red* Yah yah, it was one of the games they had lined up, and I got the MC to make  IpohBoy  go up on stage, and he literally  dragged  me along with him (which I tell you I no small feat as I'm haaaardly a skinny wisp of a person!). My God, he's strong! I tell you, had I been wearing more stable shoes (4-inch stilettoes,  urlLink  Cik Stiletto  ! whoop!) and dug in my heels, I swear he would have probably  carried  me up onto the stage!  So there we were, 3 men and 3 women, totally clueless as to what we had to endure to win some 'prizes'. Then we were told to seduce the crowd. Urp! Not going too heavily into embarassing details, I thought for sure the guy who almost took off his pants (!) would win. I forgot it was a male-heavy crowd .. so   I   ended up winning! Not bad, huh? So if I'm 'seductive' enough  (ya right!)  to win the contest,  HOW COME I'M STILL SINGLE?!?!!!  I swear, it was the short skirt that did it. Lolz.   But I got lots of cool hair product thingies! And I also got a proper make-up box, which I have been wanting to buy but have been short on cash! Yay! lolz ....  Then  MrMucho ,  Doggie  and I went to Frangipani at Bkt Ceylon. Very nice bar, nice place to chill with friends and chat. Well, if you're into that sort of thing. Lovely decor! My only complaint was that it was 95% gay men. Urgh. Not that I have a problem with gay men, it's just that that percentage doesn't leave me with much options! Not only that, what 5% of the men there who weren't gay were ugly. Drat!  Haha! Macamlah dia tu cantik sangat! :oP  Ah well. Met a couple  MrMucho 's friends (one gay man, the other said gay man's straight girl best friend). Nice people. Will definitely keep in touch with them.  Yawn. Having just got home, I shall have to resume with my packing. So far,  nothing  is packed! Haha! And seeing as how  MrMucho  will be swinging by at 10am tomorrow to drive up to Penang, I don't think I'll be getting any sleep tonight. Must make sure I bring everything! Besides, I can always sleep in the car.     Note :  It's been on for 8 hours, and Stila Smudge Pot eyeliner still  has not run!!  Miracle eyeliner, this is! *G*           You're  Les Miserables !  by Victor Hugo    One of the best known people in your community, you have become something of a phenomenon.

      Peh. Experiencing another .. whatever-you-want-to-call-it block. Maybe it's just a Block. Well, whatever it is, I just wanted to have something less depressing pop up on the main page.    I love you, you love me, Let's gang up and get Barney, With a Boom! and a Bang!, Barney's on the floor, No more purple di-no-saur!!   *G*  Overheard some Barney ad on the radio recently, and it brought back many torturous memories. I just thank the Merciful Powers-That-Be that  LittleSumo  (my 2 1/2 year-old kid brother) never discovered and will (I ferverently pray) never discover that horrifying purple minion of Lucifer.  Apart from that, life has been .. ordinary. I'm wary about asking for a life less ordinary because I  know  what kind of trouble  those  kind of wishes can get you.  Be careful what you wish for.   *Shudder*    Ending on a more pleasant note, I'll be in Penang this weekend, attending  Mr Mucho 's convocation ceremony. Am honoured he asked me to attend. :o)  Gasp! What to WEAR??!?!?!!!   Also, am planning to have a ton of fun in (hopefully) sunny, sunny Penang! Anybody nak kirim anything? Just let me know! ;o)

        If wishes were horses, I would own one the size of which would rival Sparta's 'gift' to Troy. It would also be just as treacherous.     Have you ever felt so alone? I mean, so truly alone that you have absolutely no one? You don't want to burden the people you love because, frankly, it's not their burden to bear? You just feel so .. lost.    Why does loving have to hurt so much? It shouldn't. I don't think it should.   Love is a double-edged sword which cuts both ways. Yet we would go to the Ends of the Earth to seek it.   Right now, one end cuts significantly deeper than the other. Is it no wonder it hurts so much?    Sleep is a shameless tease. Peace eludes me. Numbness is a constant, unwanted companion.  I have ever been a trusting one.  "Accepted, unless proven otherwise."  But I have never been one who is quick to love.  And the one time I fall, I fall hard. On my face.  And the one time I admit I did, it gets thrown back at me. In my face.   He  is in my every waking thought,  He  haunts even my dreams. In the day, I can at least control my thoughts. Foolish, unbidden fantasies can be easily dismissed. The nights are the worst. My dreams show me the best of What Could Have Been. I have no control over those dreams. I cannot banish them nor memories of them so easily. They might not be real, but the tears are. They continue to torment me. I begin to dread nightfall.  People tell me  He  is not worth it. I nod in assent. I tell myself  He  isn't worth any of it; not the heartbreak, not the misery, none of the sorrow, none of the tears, none of my love. Yet I know how much I lie to myself. Everything is a big, confused Lie. He is worth all that and so much more.  Yet, I cannot bring myself to reach out and grab All I Truly Desire. I am unable to fight for that which I have been waiting for all my life, because I know that should I win, I could never live with myself.   "What's it like, I wonder, to know he chooses to be with another woman?"   I know all too well.

      It was  Ms.  .. oops! sorry,  Puan S 's wedding reception at the Istana Hotel tonight. Last night, technically. Aaaaah! On the night of June, the 19th, ok?  What an event that was. I'm not even the bride and I'm pooped! I must admit, though, that it is less of a physical tiredness than weariness due to being overwhelmed. My eyes totally popped when the arrival of the Sultan and Sultanah of Kedah were announced! And how much more they popped when   urlLink Ms. Stiletto   pointed out that the lady with the biiiiig hair sitting alone in one of the "royalty" seats was the Raja Permaisuri Agung! And Tun Dr Mahatir Mohd was announced next! Followed by Tun Hjh Siti Hasmah! And flanking them were the various MBs and Bendaharis of States ... adoi. And here I thought that Najib was already a big deal. Nampak sangat I am so not "high society" .. and thank God for that!  Aku tak nak kahwin orang high profile! Tak terdaya!!!! (Isy .. perasan sangat. Macamlah orang high profile nakkan kita ...)   Apart from the bowing and scraping and the  sembah-sembah "ampun tuanku, beribu-ribu ampun" (or whatever)  .. and all that tiresome  protocol , it was a beautiful wedding. The plus side was that I got to meet some old friends tonight, some of whom I have not seen since we left high school all those 8 long years ago.  Baru perasan betapa tuanya aku. Oh tidaaaaaak!!    urlLink MzMin   was right.  Puan S 's wedding DID turn out to be a mini high school reunion! It was nice, tho.  The food wasn't so great .. but maybe that's just me. Like I told   urlLink Ms. Stiletto  , most weddings I attend happen to be Johorean. Seeing as how this family is from Kedah, the food, to me, was therefore somewhat .. unusual fare for a wedding. Entahlah. I suppose kalau dah biasa sangat, anything else would be a bit odd. Tapi bedal jugak. ;o)   urlLink Chek Anne   kita contol sikit.  Alah, sikit je.  Hehe. Tapi maybe that's just because her "friend" was sitting next to her. Or maybe I just  terperasan  that way because I was sitting too far away to notice berapa kali dia tambah nasi and lauk. Heh heh.   Chek Anne  jangan marah, ye?   It was a thoroughly enjoyable night. Everyone was all "gussied up" (to borrow   urlLink MzMin  's term) and generally looking super hot. Too bad I forgot to buy batteries for my camera beforehand. :o(   Yes, it was a fun night. It was fun being catty and watching other people with their baaaaad fashion sense. Can you believe the Sultan of Kedah turned up wearing a  flourescent green  baju melayu when the Sultanah was wearing cream? What the hell were the either of them - or BOTH of them! - thinking??!?!!   Also, there was the very entertaining little game I was playing with this cute guy at the next table. From the moment I arrived, he was eyeing me top to toe. No, not in a leering sort of manner, otherwise I wouldn't have encouraged that sort of behaviour! Also it just so happened that I was sitting directly in his line of sight - which I swear was NOT engineered and ENTIRELY coincidental - so all throughout dinner there was a game of  main-main mata  going on. I peeked at him, he peeked at me, flirtatious smiles, a wink or two, you get the picture. Somewhat juvenile, I know, but it kept things, ah, interesting. Besides, he was CUTE! *giggles* Things got a little less immature when gazes were locked for a second, then two, then a few.  However, the fun came to a sudden halt when the woman next to him started playing with his hair and kissed him on the cheek.  Sigh.  How come the only men who are ever interested in me seem to be previously spoken for? It made me wonder if I only look good to men after they become bored with their partners. What wonders THAT does for my self-esteem! *dripping sarcasm* Seriously, it's like the only types of men I seem to be able to attract these days are attached men. Am I *gasp!* the Forbidden Fruit? Yeah right. Macamlah hot sangat. Hmm .. hot? fruit? Does that make me the human equivalent of  pisang goreng?  Or  cempedak goreng?  Cause I'm  definitely  no hot apple strudel.  Apa daaaaa ... Now I've made myself hungry. Mana boleh aku cari cempedak goreng malam-malam nih?   It would be an understatement to say that I'm more than just a little sick of attention from attached men, so that game ended pretty abruptly.  But after that, there was that super fun game of trying to guess what the keepsakes actually were. Top guesses were table runners and/or embroidered purses for the ladies, no idea AT ALL what the men received. It was truly baffling. Either way, the guesses didn't make any sense. Who gives away table runners for wedding keepsakes?? The embroidered purses were more logical, but they seemed a little too big. Once I arrived home, I finally found out what they were. Embroidered cushion covers.     Me:  Blink. Blink blink. Maaaaaak....    They still don't make sense .. but they're pretty, so who's complaining? *G*  And I learned a new word today!  Gonjang.  As in, "Ikram tu, gonjang lah!" Haha!  Wait a minute. Gonjang ke gonjeng ke gojang? I dah lupa. Apa nak buat. SPM dapat C3 je for BM ....   Oh! One thing did serve to make the night somewhat less than perfect:  ( Huda , I've put this in just for you. ;o) )  the horrible, horrible wedding singers.   urlLink MzMin  , if you thought that Hindustani singer and that Malay pakcik last night at the nikah were bad, you would have been praying for them tonight. Tonight's were not quite bad-beyond-words, but they were definitely  bad . Someone should have either shot them, or shot me. Either way, just someone make the misery stop.   Speaking of which,   urlLink MzMin  , your absence was felt.   urlLink The Girlygirls   were one short, and don't think none of us noticed. (Okay, technically we're several short, but the others couldn't help being stuck in the UK, so they don't count. *pout*) We missed ya,   urlLink Min  . Excuse No. 186 (and #187 and #194) not withstanding, it would have been a real   urlLink Girlygirls  Event  had you been there.  If it had been  my  wedding, I would have made you come bogel if need be. Haha! Nasib baik it wasn't.  ;oP

      Today, an old friend is getting hitched.  Ms. S  (soon to be  Puan S ) and me, we've known each other a loooong time, starting way back in primary school and all through high school. Despite that, I can't claim we've ever been close. I think it's got a lot to do with her being the Classy Lady, as opposed to my brashness. Hehe. But despite the difference, we've always been on good terms, and she's marrying a good man, and I'm so happy for her! :)  Last night was her  malam berinai . I made the embarassing mistake of thinking it would be a small, private affair of girlfriends gathering, gossipping, having fun, getting all weepy and sentimental, and wishing the bride well, as is the custom with other Malay weddings. A kind of intimate gathering of  girls  for the last time before one of them finally became a  Woman . Boy, was I wrong!  Like I said to   urlLink MzMin  , we should have known better!! This is the marriage of the children of two of the most prominent families in Malaysia, so what the hell was I thinking dressing  down  for the occassion??! I should have known that there's  no such thing  as  private  and  intimate  with a wedding of this magnitude! Argh.  Yes, I am vain, up to a point. I believe in dressing well, and dressing to suit an occasion.  Never  have I over-dressed nor under-dressed for  any  occasion. I have been guilty of minor breaches, but never too severely. (We can blame this on my upbringing. My mother is a stickler for propreity. I thank her for that.) But yesterday! Oh. My. God. I was soooo under-dressed to the point of being practically  UN dressed! The little kids running around were better dressed than me! Thank goodness for this huuuuge wall I could hide behind! Needless to say, we didn't stay for very long. (Apologies to   urlLink MzMin   for that. Sorry, dahlink!)   *Sigh* The one time I under-dress, I do it to monumental proportions.   Me:  Eh, apesal tudung-tudung makciks ni mamancar-mancar, hah?  Idiot.   Okay, it might not be that big a deal to you, but it was to me. There are certain things you take pride in, it might be your work with some people, it might be your ability to give good speeches, whatever! And to err so dramatically in it... Well. It's a huge blow. I've rarely been soooo embarassed ever! Aiya ... Yes, yes, I know that there are other more important things, but dressing appropriately is important to me too! *huff* *preen* ;)  Adoooi ... I've learned my lesson. This is THE Wedding of the Year. I shall be pulling out all stops tonight, and tomorrow, and Sunday. It's no longer a matter of dressing to the nines, it's dressing to the elevens! I'm going for the kill, babeh! Lolz ...  But tonight (and the weekend) is not about me. It's about celebrating the marriage and happiness of a friend. It's about sharing her joy, and giving her just as much in return. It's about wishing her well, and helping her start off her marriage the best and most joyful way possible, and may that joy be everlasting.

      Aaaah .. There's nothing like starting anew, is there?  Reasons for the move are simple. Well, there's actually only one reason: Better Templates. Me being the web-illiterate I am, I wanted a snazzier-looking page with minimum fuss (not to mention effort) and after looking at other blogs hosted by blogger, I've decided they're snazzier, minimal-effort and fuss-free enough for me.   So here we are, ladies and gents. A fresh new look for the same old trash.  .. and so much for starting anew. I've brought all my old baggage with me. Peruse at will. *winkz*

      What is it with people who move to KL from .. other places (read:   KAMPUNGS!!!!  ) .. and then gripe on and on and on about how KL is so polluted  lah , crime rate so high  lah , people so impersonal and unfriendly  lah , food not as good/authentic/fresh as it is back home  lah , traffic jams so bad here not like back home where there's  never  a traffic jam even during peak periods  lah  ... you get the idea ... but  still  choose to stay here?    If it's sooooo good at home, go home  lah ! Nobody's making you stay, are they? If the food is sooooo good back home, then go eat at home!  Buat semak je kat KL ni   with all you  kampung  people  menyibuk  here,  tak sedar  that  they  are the ones who  make  KL so congested to begin with.  Tak sedar diri lansung  .. and then they actually have the  nerve  to  complain?!?!?! Ni yang buat aku naik berang nih ...     *Fumes*    Sorry. These people just irritate me to no end! They come here looking for a better life, then proceed to put down so much about it when they find themselves out of their depths and unable to keep pace .. then wax overly lyrical about whatever Hicksville they call home, and how  everything  there is by faaaaaar superior to KL. And yet, after realising how much better everything is at home, they  still  refuse(!)   to go home ... 'cause KL is where It Is! Bloody inconsistent  beruks . Make up your minds. Either stay and shut the f*ck up, or go home and shut the f*ck up. Either way, just shut the f*ck up. Keep your small-town opinions to yourself, because KLites are interested in neither you NOR your little opinions.    Shite excuses like "just a hint of homesickness" don't hold water in the bucket. If you came here looking for a better life, better education or to  cari rezeki  or whatever, you don't piss on the one that fed you.     I'm not saying non-KLites are not welcome here. They're more than welcome. And I understand pride for your hometown, but you don't go around dissing someone else's home, ESPECIALLY  NOT  to the face of someone who was born and bred in KL. F*ckin Hell, I don't go to f*cking boring Ipoh and go on and on and on about how dead that place is and oh! what a paradise I think KL is (even though I really DO think Ipoh is absolutely catatonic and KL is really where things are At.) It's just f*cking bad manners, man!    And maybe that's what bothers me the most; the lack of sensitivity, lack of consideration, and plain f*cking bad manners. Oh. One more: small-mindedness.    Another thing I've noticed about a lot of people who did not grow up in large cities is that they tend to be very small-minded. And if they happen to be  Chinese, it's worse! Their mindset seem to be somewhat paradoxical: they tend to be (in varying degrees, but almost always very) community-minded, to the point where they almost lose all sense of individuality, but yet they tend to be so self-centered. Being selfish, yet a non-individual. Selfish sheep. Baaaaa.    Yes, I know this only applies to some people. There are people I know who moved here from elsewhere and they do have fond recollections of home, and yes, sometimes the food back home is better, but KL has been good to them, that's why they stay. They sometimes do privately think home is better, but KL is good too and after so many years, KL also became  home .    You just don't piss in the house that sheltered you.    Everyday I am grateful I grew up in KL. Everyday I am grateful for this wonderful city, bustling with life. Everyday I'm grateful for the lessons I've learned from her, from her people. Everyday I'm glad I don't live in a Hickstown where someone's dirty laundry becomes everybody's business.    One of the more valuable lessons I'm glad I've learned from growing up in the city is Respect for Personal Space. In small communities, everybody knows your name, as the theme song goes. I won't deny it has its pros, but for a highly private person like me, it definitely has its cons. In KL, that kind of familiarity is rare.     I love that I can walk on the streets without having to bother saying "Hi!" every few meters, because if I wanted company, I would call a friend. I suppose I could just stay at home if I wanted to be left alone, but that gets lonely. Walking around KL by myself gives me this feeling of complete privacy around people. I can be alone without being lonely. It is truly unique.    It's not saying that KLites are unfriendly. By far. I find that KLites are amongst the warmest and people you would find. KLites are adept at being totally impersonal on one hand, yet extremely welcoming on the other. I find it so easy to strike up a pleasant conversation with just about anyone on the LRT, yet everyone would leave you completely alone should you so desire.    KL is a wonderful melting pot of cultures, cuisines, personalities and quirks. That's what I love most about KL: her quirks. I love KL and she's been good to me. That's why I'll never leave. No matter where I might go, no matter who I turn out to be, I'll always come back. This is my home, it always will be.    Sigh. It's late, I'm woozy. I'm going to sleep.

      Everywhere I turn nowadays friends are getting married/engaged/having babies. This recent spate of .. umm … other people’s joy(s) have had a morose, inversely proportional effect on me. Don’t get me wrong. It’s not that I’m not happy for them. I am! I’m just … not happy for me.     Sigh. Selfish of me to be concerned with poor-poor-me thoughts, I know, but it’s .. inevitable, I think. Everyone’s getting married! I feel left out! I wanna get married too!!! *ahem* Uh .. no, not really. Just a little bit of childish-foot-stamping-tantrum humour there. :o) Eh heh. I’m nowhere near ready to be making commitments and handling responsibilities of that sort. I need to grow up a bit more first. *winkz*    Nevertheless, it all got me feeling a little blue .. compounded by a few other recent happenings as well. So what does a girl do when she’s down in the dumps? *drum roll, please*     GO SHOPPING!!!!   Of course. *winkz*    Aaaah .. nothing like a spot of retail therapy to cheer a girl up. It’s one of those things men will  never  be able to understand. Well, okay, I do happen to know some men who understand the healing properties of making completely frivolous purchases, but they’re (mostly) gay (or are simply in denial as to their sexuality), so they don’t count. ;o)    For all you girls, there really isn’t any need for me to expound on the subject, is there? For the guys, however … I don’t know. There really isn’t an explanation as to why spending money makes us feel so much better. Maybe it’s the thrill of having something new that’s uplifting. Maybe the money is in some way representative of our worries, and that by exchanging the cash for something else, it’s as though we’re exchanging our sorrows for something better. Something cheering. Something of   our own choosing.   …. Or maybe it’s solely the satisfaction of fulfilling our greed for material possessions. Ha ha! But whatever the reasons, shopping makes us feel  GOOD.  *G*    I don’t know. It seems that for guys, the (usually) most effective way to  lepas geram  is through physical exertions (I mean sports, weights, gym, martial arts .... what were  you  thinking?!?!!!! *G*), but in recent years, I’ve discovered that shopping is a highly effective way for me to let off some steam. A very costly method, admittedly, but hey, whatever works, right? And it’s a lot more therapeutic (not to mention damaging to your purse!) to do it with someone who’s just as shop-happy as you! (Read: gay best friend. We shall, for future reference, call him  Mr. Mucho. ) *G*       Inventory of What I Bought Today    1. 1 dress shoe, 3 slippers. 2. Cutesy .. err .. 'essentials' from Topshop and a Stila Smudge Pot. 3. Lomograph 4. T-shirt from Radioactive. 5. Totally over-priced dinner for 2.      Item(s) 1  : I needed a pair of nice shoes for formal/semi-formal ocassions, 2 slippers for casual wear, 1 novelty-slippers for the beach. But I don’t really need an excuse to buy shoes. Men, take note: A woman can  never  have enough shoes. (I don’t think Ikram needs this lesson, tho. Hee hee heeeee..)      Item(s) 2  : Feel good, pick-me-up items. Things completely unnecessary, but make us feel good having. In other words, Comfort Items. ;o)      Item 3  : My sister’s 21st bday present. She’s been mad about  urlLink Lomography  for a while now, so it was a wonderful find. Was having a time thinking of a good gift, and found it completely by chance. I think it’s called Serendipity.      Item 4  : I needed clothes. I always need clothes.     Item 5  : Hey, it was a day of indulgence, and since Mr. Mucho was sweet enough to watch “Troy” again with me (despite him thinking it’s a crap movie) just because I wanted to watch it sooooooo bad, well. I couldn’t think of a more perfect way to end the day.    Oh. Troy. “The Face That Launched a Thousand Ships” was NOT Helen of Sparta neé Troy’s. It was Orlando Bloom’s!! Aiyoooooh! Could that boy be any more beautiful??!?!!! It’s   obscene   how gorgeous he is!! That kind of face should come with a Public Health Warning! "U" rating, indeed! And it’s not just him. Eric Bana (my new Hunk-of-the-Month), Brad Pitt, Sean Bean … they’re ALL in the SAME movie!! This officially makes “Troy” the FIRST movie in the history of movie-making where the male actors are waaaaay prettier than the ladies! Adoi … That movie had me swooning every 4 minutes. Total babe-fest! Hee hee heeeeeee ….    That aside though, it  was  a good movie. A tad slow in some places, a few slap-my-forehead-what-the-hell-kind-of-script-writing-is-this moments, but overall, it was a well-paced movie, very high on the entertainment level, if, erm, watching people being butchered is your idea of entertainment. Also, I’ll have to disagree with Mr. Mucho who thought the acting was wooden. I thought the acting wasn’t too bad, if you overlook the fact that despite them being Greeks, they spoke in a hodgepodge of accents ranging from English to Scottish to American, and one very confused Belgian/English/American/Australian accented Helen.     Aiya! I'm not doing too good a job of giving it a glowing review, am I? It's good, lah!   I definitely recommend the movie. Just make sure you visit the loo beforehand. Running time is 2 hours 57 minutes.  (Apa daaa … Cakap je lah 3 hours!!)

      I love how eventhough this was our first meeting in .. oh, about three or so years, we could pick up where we left off as if we had only just seen each other yesterday.   I love how eventhough so much has happened to us, we've neither of us changed, not essentially.   I love that you're still so you, the you I fell in love with almost a decade ago.   I love that you really seem to remember so much about me, despite the infrequency of our meetings.  I love that you can still make me laugh so much, and that you still have that gorgeous laugh.  I'm glad you called Mum today. I loved meeting you for coffee. I hope we meet again - soon!    p/s: Don't get excited, everyone. (Especially  YOU . Yes, I mean  YOU .) I'm talking about one of my mum's gay friends. He's old enough to be a close friend of hers, yet young enough still to be my girlfriend as well. He's absolutely lovely. I only realised today how much I've missed him.

      Alaaa! My holidays are over!  Boohoohoo!!  I've just started work with my uncle's company / my mum's company at Bukit Jalil.   Yes, I have two punch cards, and both my aunt (who's in charge of my uncle's company's BJ division) and my mum insist on putting me on  their  payroll.  It's a tug-of-war. I am almost at my wit's end trying to evade my aunt. I can't skirt around me mum. I have to live with her.  I have two desks, one in each office. I have two chairs. I have two sets of stationery. I have two official 'positions'-slash-'designations' for the work(s) I'm  supposed  to be doing. I have all these frou-frou trappings and all the glamorous titles that go with it, but in actual fact, I really have nothing to do. Nothing. Nada.   Okay la. I'm still getting a feel of things, but currently, my job isn't anthing more exerting than flipping over to the next page of the Operations & Maintenance Manuals.  Adooi! Lenguh dah tangan I!  Hopefully things will start to be more interesting once I become more familiar with the systems at the stadiums. Otherwise, I might throw myself on my 2B pencil. One of them. Maybe both if things get even more boring.  It's insane. Despite all the fuss, however, I have no idea what I'm getting paid.  IF  I'm being paid at all!  Huh, laku jugak saya ni. Yelah, kalau dah free ...   But they were all right. Every single one of 'em. I no longer have much time for anything else!! Everyone told me working would do this, and that I should enjoy the cuti before I start.  I belum puas cutiiiii!!!  But what to do? Dah kena paksa punya pasal....

      Yes, i know this is a copping-out, but it'll have to do until I find something worthwhile writing about. This past week has been nothing but a severe lack of anything even remotely resembling inspiration. My life-force has been sapped, totally drained kering-kontang.  OOOooohh .. Tres new-age-y!  Also, I hate to write when I'm pissed off. Sad, yes. Pissed off, naaah. Anger and irritation make me think incoherently - and bitchily at that. Besides, I had to stop embarrassing myself further.  Re: previous post. Then again, maybe don't.  Sasterawan Negara, I am not.  Or should that be Sasterawati? Is there such a thing as sastera wati ???   Yup, yet another test which determines my personality. I swear, if all them were true, I'm every woman. Person. Whatever. They're still fun tho. ;o)    urlLink Jenny Turpish Slapped Me! Personality Test.     Wackiness: 38/100 Rationality: 22/100 Constructiveness: 46/100 Leadership: 52/100   You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with. You may explode.    Wackiness: 50/100 Rationality: 34/100 Constructiveness: 46/100 Leadership: 54/100    You are an SEDL--Sober Emotional Destructive Leader. This makes you a dictator. You prefer to control situations, and lack of control makes you physically sick. You feel have responsibility for everyone's welfare, and that you will be blamed when things go wrong. Things do go wrong, and you take it harder than you should.  You rely on the validation and support of others, but you have a secret distrust for people and distaste for their habits and weaknesses that make you keep your distance from them. This makes you very difficult to be with romantically. Still, a level-headed peacemaker can keep you balanced.  Despite your fierce temper and general hot-bloodedness, you have a soft spot for animals and a surprising passion for the arts. Sometimes you would almost rather live by your wits in the wilderness somewhere, if you could bring your books and your sketchbook.  You also have a strange, undeniable sexiness to you. You may go insane.   ~@~  Yes, I took the test twice. Mildly-obsessive-compulsive me does tend to do this to check for consistency. *rolleyes* However, I thought both answers were interesting. Bottom-line: I'm volatile-ly insane. ;o)

      Phew. It’s been a while since the last update.  Gatal jari I, you ...  Thing is, my eyes have gone blurry for a bit and this is the clearest it’s been so far .. which is not exactly saying things are crystal clear just yet ....    So! How has my week been? Great! It’s been great, but there was one day which stood out in particular: Wednesday the 14th of July. Why?   urlLink AMIR YUSSOF   LIVE AT THE LA BODEGA LOUNGE in Bangsar!! Aiyeeeee!!!   It was totally amazing, despite the cramped venue. The initial plan was for us (me and two friends) to have a nice dinner at the La Bodega Restaurant, then head up to the Lounge for drinks early so we could get seats (seeing as how seating was limited) in time for the scheduled 10pm show. However, those plans were scrapped when I was stood up by said friends. Either I mistakenly assumed their agreeing to the plan was assent, or they hadn't made it clear that they were not committed, but whatever it was, I expected them to join me for a leisurely night out, and instead they both bailed out at the last minute. Okay, one bailed out, and the other wanted to go to the gym first and arrive at the Lounge at 10:30pm-ish.  Ya, kua. Performance still on, wat? Also, maybe we can go mamak at Bangsar for a bit of dinner after gym first before the show ...  Err. Okay. This coming from a person who  knows  how much I love Amir Yussof and how much I was looking forward to the performance. Right. To say I was a  little  bit miffed would have been a gross understatement.   Whatever. I ended up going with my sister, and we had a rockin' good time!   Like I said, by the time we got there at about 9:15pm, the place was already crowded. Alamak! I thought we would have been amongst the early birds!    [snip!]  It turned out, though, that we  were  amongst the earlier ones. You wouldn't believe how packed it got later on (around 11pm onwards)! Those in the back were packed like sardines in a teeny weeny can. Friend came by after her gym session and I didn’t even get to see her coz she left after the first set and I couldn't get to her on account of the massive crowd. Little Sister and I got a bit lucky at the second set. We managed to charm a group into letting us have a little side stool to perch our derrieres on. Be thankful for small blessings!  [unsnip!]      urlLink Amir   strolled to the little corner which served as the 'stage', wearing an open-throated white shirt and faded, faded, ultra-soft blue jeans, with his curling hair gathered up in a small pony-tail. I almost fainted deadaway. This man is so beautiful! He's got one of the loveliest facial structures I've ever seen! His eyes crinkles almost playfully when he smiles, and he smiles to make hearts melt. And his laugh! *swoon! THUD!!*   He kicked off the night with " urlLink Little Bird ", ended with "Break Away" (I think), with " urlLink Third People ", " urlLink Fool In Love ", "Sweet Surrender" and "The Thin Line" interspersed between covers he did of other songs (NO "Hotel California", please!!).   I was somewhat disappointed on two counts:  1. He performed more covers than originals. I was there to listen to HIS compositions! I love his songs!  2. He didn’t perform " urlLink Wasted Time ", which is my favourite of all his songs. Bummer.   However, those were the only things that made my enjoyment of the night slightly less-than-perfect. Well, I could also have done without the young mat-salleh woman (who, btw, had a terribly inadequate 'support system') who insisted on dancing  right in front  of   urlLink Amir Yussof, Rock God   (remember! it was a   small   place!), thereby blocking the entire view for most of us, and instead replaced the excellent view of   urlLink The Man   and his band with the ghastly sight of her floppy mat-salleh tits  melambung  every-which-way. *shudders* But yeah. She left after people finally had enough and started hissing at her, and apart from that, I had no complaints. *winkz*   I tell you, that   urlLink man   has a way with music! His velvet-and-gravel voice is   to .. die .. for!!   *swoon* I would have melted into a gooey, hot puddle at his feet if not for the desire to jump him (I mean,  speak with  him) afterwards!  Maaaak! Lawa nye mamat niiiiii!!! Hai, bilalah dia nak datang minang aku???    He performed his first two (or three) songs solo, then was joined by his 'friends': Jamie Wilson (lead guitar), Casey (of the Seribu-Impian-song fame) (bass), and John Ashley Thomas (drums). Yes, they all rocked.    [snip! Mini rant ahead]  I've always found it a bit crappy how usually the crowd only gives the lead guitarists their due when they 'goreng's their instrument, but bassists and drummers are rarely fully appreciated. It's not fair! *grumbles about the sad musical under-education and the gross lack of observation of general audiences*  [unsnip! Mini rant over!]    Ahem. Where was I? Oh, yes. They all rocked, but the star of the show, only second to  urlLink  The Man  , of course, was the drummer, John.  Wah lau wei!!  That kid rocked! And ‘kid’, I kid you not. Only 19 years old and he kicked serious ass with them drums! He totally blew me away!! Even before the first drum solo!!! I was totally smitten! He hooked me like a starving ikan keli after a juicy, glutted worm. Such technique! Such skill! Such talent! He was a natural with the drums!   Of course, he had 10 years of experience tucked under his belt. But such fluidity with his instrument! No amount of practise could ever amount to that. The boy is a genius!   I was so impressed with him that I forgot I was supposed to be a dignified 24-year-old and accosted him at the end of the first set, where I told him (okay, gushed) how impressed I was with his drumming. We chatted a bit, and then he had to attend to  The Man  who was calling him over. Well, that was that, though. He had said that it would be nice to chat some more after the show, but we had to leave early coz Little Sister was tired and had to wake up early for work the next day. Pooh. Well, at least she was nice enough to let me enjoy the end of the second set before heading for home.    urlLink  Amir  's performance ended at the end of the second set, but he had a friend play after him, a sort of 'guest' performer, whom the band accompanied. We didn't stay for that last bit, much as I wanted to. Well, you've got to compromise sometimes, and besides, it was already past 1am. So I didn't get to chat some more with John. Dang. I really wanted his number so we could hang out sometime.    TO JAM!! TO JAM!!!!!!  Huh! What are you thinking, hah?!! He's   nineteen  , for crying out loud!! I already have enough problems dating a 22-year-old!   :o)   Yes, drove home on cloud nine. Mum had a bit of a fit when we waltzed in at close to 2am. I responded by dreamily asking her to go  minang  him for me in the morning. She quietly looked at me, probably wondering what kind of drugs they were handing out at the Lounge. It was stronger than any drug, baby. It was   LURVE  . Hooo yeah! She must have known that, though, coz she looked more amused than annoyed. She said okay, but as I'm reminded of this now, I realise that she hasn't gotten back to me at all regarding this. Hmmmmm ... Must follow-up ......     p.s: There will be another Amir Yussof performance at the La Bodega in KL (Tengkat Tung Shin) this Saturday, 24th of July, 10pm onwards. Again, no fee will be levied, seating will be limited. This time, however, he’ll be performing solo. Whoopee! Anyone interested in hooking up for this, let me know!

      *Catching my breath*  How come eventhough I'm currently unemployed, enjoying a loooong break between the end of my schooling and the beginning of a career, and no longer worrying about my results, I STILL don't have enough hours in a day?!!   ... although the difference may be that I've been filling up all my time with the pursuit of leisure instead of breaking my back over books or work. Muahahahhaaaaa!! ;oP  It's nice, not having much responsibility beyond buying food for my cats every two weeks. (Even then it's not  that  much of a chore because it gives me an excuse to go to Pet Safari at Ikano and chat with that cute employee who keeps giving me discounts, free kitty treats, and, not to mention, the eye. *winkz*)  So I spend the rest of my day(s) with  DrMucho , who is also currently on a break, going to the gym (and checking out the mucho macho gym instructors who, btw, don't pay us the slightest attention, but are nonetheless yummy eye-candy) and shopping, window or otherwise. I tell you, it's absolute suicide on my bank account going to any mall with decent shops with him! I've resorted to leaving my ATM cards at home and carrying only RM50 when I'm out with him. Thank God I refuse to do credit cards! I must confess though, that this strategy is only half as effective as I would like it to be. Things like the Zara Sale are so hard to resist ….  But (yes, I know it's wrong to start sentences with 'But', BUT I'm not writing a term paper, eh? We can all be informal here. *winkz*) .. but these are the 'ordinary' diversions of my days. A few days ago, I had the good fortune to be treated to a full-day spa treatment at the Sembunyi Spa at the  urlLink CyberView Lodge . I will now shamelessly describe this magnificent experience of leisurely decadence to all!   I’ve always been curious about this spa, curiosity which was no doubt borne out of reading countless articles about it in the media. (Bombardment advertising really does work!) Unfortunately, always (as the Kemaman-ese put it)  adok seng  (ie. no money).  Then, out of the wonderful wonderful blue,  Mum  decides she wants a mini-getaway. Initial plans of a family trip to Tioman had to be scrapped due to the fact that there were no available seats on the flights to Tioman on all weekends till the end of the season, and  Her Royal Highness  turned her nose up at driving down  all the way  to Mersing. *Sigh* But perhaps it was a good thing that the Tioman getaway didn’t work out, as she then decided that the next best thing was a spa treat! So with all three daughters in tow, she converged on the Sembunyi Spa like a Regal Royal with her entourage of  dayang-dayang s.  We arrived at 11am, and were introduced to the various services offered. We all ended up taking a full-body, 6-hour treatment, which was aptly named “Lost In Paradise”. It was a “Spa Lover’s Dream!” which consisted of a bath, body scrub, wrap and massage, facial, hair treatment, and lunch.   The wonderful day began with a sauna/steam room and hot and cold jacuzzi session, and a ginger drink which tasted somewhat noxious at first, but left a lovely aftertaste. It was apparently a ‘detoxifying tonic’ the spa had concocted, and hooooboy! Detoxifying, I kid you not! That little cuppa, I believe, had me tinkling every half an hour! Me, whose (unfortunate) powers of water retention are almost legendary!  Maybe that’s why I kept going, kot...   At noon, a whole bevy of spa therapists converged upon us in the wet spa, eager to start us on our respective treatments. My therapist was this lovely, small Balinese girl called  Wayan .   Mum  and I were led to the Mayang Sari Suite.  Sweet...  It wasn’t plush, nor was it opulent, but impressive it certainly was. It was rich and indulgent in an unassuming way. Very tasteful. No wonder the Schumachers come here every year, without fail (or so we were told..)  First up on the menu: Balinese Massage. I actually wanted the Thai Massage, but it wasn’t an available option that day. Pooh. I selected the use of some sort of ginger aromatic oil for my treatments as I found it fragrant, but unobtrusively so. I was also told that it had a somewhat warming property. What they failed to tell me, though, was its sensual-bordering-on-erotic effect.   Whooooo! That oil made me ..   high  . In a sensual way. I’m not sure if it was  Wayan ’s massage skills, or the oil, or the whole mood of the day, or maybe it was all of it, but my senses were on overdrive. It’s a bit of a paradox, really. All the senses were fully awake, so aware, but at the same time, the body is totally relaxed, to the point where when she asked me to flip over, I almost asked her to get a crane and flip me over herself.  But the oil! The subtle sharp-sweet fragrance of the oil coupled with the smooth, long strokes of the massage, and the incredible heat coming off  Wayan ’s hands .. *phwoargh* It was so incredibly .. sensual! And that was with a female masseuse! Had it been some male massaging me, it would have undoubtedly crossed over into utterly sexual!    Note to self :  Must remember to get that oil for .. *ahem* .. future .. *cough* .. purposes. Also, must learn to give Balinese Massage. *lascivious grin*  I meant to get a bottle then, but the amazing languor I was in when we left made me unable to think beyond ±10mins of present time, so I only remembered the next day. I swear, that oil makes me want to get a guy just so I can give him a massage (.. and receive one in return, maybe? Hehee...)   After a blissful 90 minutes, we were given a body scrub and wrap. I opted for the  lulur  scrub and floral and yoghurt body mask, which lasted another 90 mins. I never thought that someone slathering yoghurt all over my body could ever feel so good! *shivers with delight!* This was followed by a 20 minute milk and blossoms bath. Aaaaah .. Pure decadence.  At 3pm, we finally took a break for lunch. Chiew! Even the lunch is spa-ish-ly healthy-rich! Grilled salmon sandwiches, lite-Ceasar’s salad, baked potato wedges and healthy juice punches and smoothies ... *swoon*  Half an hour later, our therapists lined up outside the dining lounge to collect us for the remainder of our treatments.   Facial time! I chose to have the Papaya and Oatmeal Scrub, which promised to “tame (my) temperamental skin”. It started with a floral and yoghurt ‘cleansing’ massage, that was followed by the scrub, then a mask. The scrub smelt so yummy I had to sorely resist taking a lick just to see what it tasted like! Soon, I fell asleep and stayed that way until  Wayan  came in and slapped a cold towel on my forehead. OOOoooooohhh ...... sejuk!   The hair treatment ended the session, and we finally left the spa at 6.30pm, floating on cloud nine. I have never been so pampered, my skin has never been so  smooth  (baby-smooth!), my hair so soft and well-behaved, my face so  gebu -feeling, my muscles soooo relaxed .....  For three days after, I was the most fragrant I’ve ever been! Even when I went to the gym, my God! My  sweat  never smelt so good! Betul! Tak tipu!!  Apart from the treatments, I think the general ambience of the place had a lot to do with it as well. The structures were simple, but impressive, nonetheless. The décor was uncluttered, the layout of the place very easy and relaxed. Soothing music piped out of hidden speakers and the serene trickling of water could be heard all over the place (which, perhaps, could have greatly contributed to my ... ‘detoxification’). The atmosphere was remarkably serene and unhurried, totally conducive to relaxation. The architects/designers/staff did a superb job of creating this little haven and infusing an air of .. unconcerned-ness.  All concerns to be checked-in at the front desk along with handphones, to be collected at the end of the day. Yes, there is a strict no-handphones rule at the spa.   Haha .. this may be due to my perverseness, but one of the things I liked best about that place was not having to worry about what I was wearing, or how I was wearing what, because most of the time, you’re wearing nothing. Except for a pair of almost-non-existent paper panties, of course.  I think that I might have been a nudist in a past life. I just love it. Heheee..   Yes, it cost a fair bit, but as we had taken full-body package, it was a good deal cheaper. What’s more, the package hadn’t cost as much as I thought it might have.  Also , since we went on a weekday, we were entitled to a 20% discount. Not bad at all. In the end, a full day’s worth of pampering and hand-and-feet treatment had us slightly less than RM500 poorer per person. It was worth every single sen. *winkz*  Everyone should experience this at least once! I have resolved to do it once every two or three months. *ahem* Once I’m earning my own wages, of course.  Nak pergi every month tak mampu pulak ... :o)

      I sat for my Drum Exam today. Pot. It all went to pot.  You know how they say that for a stage performance, if the final dress rehearsal is a total disaster, then opening night is almost guaranteed to be a success? Yeah. My final practise session yesterday went flawlessly. Maybe I should have purposely screwed up yesterday.  So. I knew my pieces, apa lagi? This was my first music exam in .. oh, 8 years, so  of course  I was nervous! Outside the exam room, waiting for the student before me to finish, my heart started stuttering and my body started to feel light all over, as though I was floating. Yes, that’s what happens when I get nervous. I 'float'.  I took several deep, calming breaths, and by the time that little bell rang, signalling my turn, I had regained control over my nerves. I took my little slip and handed it over to the examiner. This cute, English  male  examiner.  Yes lah. Jas memang mata keranjang sikit…   First, he asked if I would prefer to perform my pieces or do the technical exercises first. I thought I might as well get the pieces over with before another attack of jittery nerves hits again.   I was given a short practise session to make sure the drums positioning, etc. were fine. Slight adjustments were made, and the short, ungraded practise went well. Then the music for the first piece came on. Yeah, I was in the groove, baby! I managed to get through the first piece without a hitch, and we moved on to the second piece.   The second piece was a more fun piece, more fluid. It started off well, and I was grooving along, enjoying the music .. when disaster inevitably struck. With no warning what-so-ever, the  nerves  struck halfway through the song, and my  whole left leg  started trembling, ever-so-slightly, but uncontrollably. It was hard trying to take deep, calming breaths when you’re trying to concentrate on the music AND trying to keep the tempo, but I had  just  managed to regain control over my left leg when  my left hand  AND  right leg  started trembling! Augh! The only thing that was running through my mind then was  F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!!!   I think it was then that the nerves totally took over.  EVERYTHING  started trembling at that point, and I just totally gave up trying to regain control. Menggigil pun menggigil lah. All I was trying to do was finish the song as best I could, which meant getting the beats right, to hell with the shaky strokes. I finished the song, and desperately tried to quell the nervous trembling before the third song began. Fortunately, the CD player was being somewhat difficult, allowing me the few precious extra seconds I needed to calm down somewhat.   The third song. Eurgh. In retrospect, I should have probably gotten it over with  first . Always, throughout the history of my music exams, I’ve always had problems with my third song, and always, it is my favourite of the three. This time was no different. My third song was the most difficult, technically and rhythmically, and required full concentration but I also had to be totally relaxed.   I guess it’s an understatement to say that  that  strategy was shot to pieces.  Seeing, however, that I had little choice left, I ignored the more difficult passages, replacing them instead with whatever I could come up with (which were correct, rhythmically, but not exactly technically impressive) and was determined to enjoy the music.  The third piece was full of loud, crashing cymbals. What fun. You can imagine the minor relief I got by banging my frustration out on them...    The technical exercises went by smoothly, thank God. Then came the aural tests.  Groan.  First, he played a short phrase, and I had to describe the beats. A cinch. Then he was explaining something to me .. something to do with my having to listen to the next snippet of music (he would play it twice) and mimicking it on my own ... only his accent was soooo thick  (amende lah mat salleh nih cakap??)  that by the time I deciphered what he had said, the first example of the phrase had already ended! Augh! When I heard it the second time around, I realised it was a bit complicated! Apa daaaa!!   I (very politely) asked if he could play it just once more, but he said (insert super thick English accent), "Sorry, love, I’d love to, but exam procedures .. etc. ..."  Crap!  So I sat there for a few seconds, staring unblinkingly at the wall, trying to remember how that  (mutter mutter)  pattern went.   "What’s important is that you try, love."  Apa mat salleh ni  panggil aku 'love, love' pulak???   I had a vague idea of how it went, and after a few false starts, I thought, what the hell? Whatever lah! and (at the very end of the exam!!) frustration overcame the nerves, and my limbs  finally  stopped trembling.   One last Section to go before the torture would finally be over: General Musical Knowledge.    Mr Brit : First Question: What is the time signature for this piece and can you explain it, please?   Me : The time signature is 4/4, meaning four crotchet beats to a bar.  Mr Brit : Yes, thank you.    Mr Brit : Now, can you identify any dynamics markings in the score?  Me : Yeah, there's a bit of a crescendo here, which means getting louder, and some diminuendo, which is the opposite of crescendo, of course, where you should gradually play softer, and there's a bit of fortissimo here, which means loud, and some mezzo pianoforte, which .. uhhh .. should be played medium .. umm .. soft .. ehmm ..  *ramble patters off to a mumble at the sight of  Mr Brit  staring at me like I suddenly sprouted fangs...*    Mr Brit : Uh, okay. Thank you. Next, are there any 16th notes in the score?   Me : Yes.   *Pause*   Mr Brit : Errr .. can you point them out to me, please?  Me : Oh. Err .. yes.  *Idiot!!!*  Here.    Mr Brit : Right, now, could you please show me, on the score, an example of a raast?  Me :  *Blink*  A raast?  Mr Brit : Yes, a raast.  *My mind went completely blank here, because  what the hell is a raast???!?!!  If it’s some technique or grouping pattern,  DrumSifu  didn’t teach me anything about it!!  What the f*ck is a Raast?!?!! *   Mr Brit :  *Noting the silence*  Umm ..  *speaking slowly as if to a complete moron*  .. can .. you .. point .. out .. ONE .. raast?  Me :  *Feeling faint*  Urrrm … no?  Mr Brit :  *Shocked*  You don’t know what a rest is?  Me :  (Understanding  finally  dawns!) *Yelling at the top of my voice out of excitement*   A REST!  A r  E  st!! Of  course  I know what a r  E  st is!! This  (pointing at a r  E  st with flourish!)  is a r  E  st! A  crotchet  r  E  st!!!   Mr Brit :  *Releases a breath of relief .. or of gratefulness that the session was finally coming to an end and he could finally be rid of this nincompoop*  Yes, thank you!! Must have been the language, huh?  *Wry, lopsided grin.*   Me :  (Apa 'language' pulak mat salleh ni? We're both speaking English, innit?) *In a censorious tone*  Yes, it was   definitely   your accent.  *Oer. Did I just manage to deduct all my marks with that comment???!?!!*    Mr Brit :  *Smile remains stiffly pasted on his face, looking like he was torn between tossing me out the 5th floor window, or laughing himself hysterically to death. Finally settles for just tossing me out of the room.*  Right. Thank you. You may leave now.    Now  .    Sigh.   Jess, Jess. What are we going to do with you?

      *yawn* Okay, streak of mad-philosopher-genius ramblings over. Back to things inane.  ~@~  First and foremost, the  urlLink  Star Wars Personality Test .  Following in the wake of  urlLink  MzMin ,  urlLink Nads ,  urlLink Hani ,  urlLink Ike   and God knows how many countless others, I have given in to the total pointlessness of this test.  Aaaah! Who am I kidding?! Everyone and their grandmothers know how much I love useless Internet Tests! *G*  It is nevertheless enlightening to know that if I were in Star Wars Universe, I would be   urlLink   :: how jedi are you? ::   A wrinkled, green, deformed Hobbit, I am! Pleased, I am not. Uncertain with the results, I am.   I thought the test was a bit skewed, gender-ly speaking. If it had been less gender-preference oriented, I would have been the female equivalent of Hans Solo.  Maybe Hana not-Solo-for-long?  Only I'd've been trying to get into Luke Skywalker's pants.  Hey, Mark Hamill  is  pretty hot in the movies. ;o)  Realising, however, that the test is limited to actual characters, I resign to the fact that I am the inverted-speeched Yoda.  ~@~  Amir Yussof will be staging(?) an informal performance (can you call it 'staging a performance' if it's informal???) at the  urlLink   La Bodega Lounge   in Bangsar July 14th, 10pm-ish. It'll be more of a jam session with some other music-friends of his. Whatever. I love his music, and if it gets monotonous (which I doubt it will), I can always just sit there (or stand; seating will be limited) and oogle at his swoon-some  chun ness. I wanna I wanna. Anyone interested in joining me? Otherwise, I'll have to find a way to talk  DrMucho  into being my escort. Hell, if it comes down to it, I'll go by myself if need be. It's just that it'd be a lot more fun if there was company. *flutter eyelashes flutter* Oh, admission is free, btw.  ~@~  My mum's been bugging me to get tickets to "Barney and Friends" and "Pinocchio on Ice" for  LittleSumo . I'll get tix to the Pinocchio show for her, but I'll be damned if I have anything to do with Barney!   ~@~  Currently headbanging to Trapt. They're quite good. "Time For Change" and "Dissemble" are particularly catchy, although I don't like "Headstrong" all that much. Yum. Bring on the Rock (music), babeh.   There's just something about this genre of music which strikes a chord in me. I can't describe it. It just feels .. right, in the way that R&B, rap, pop, etc. doesn't.   Btw, I can't stand black music, barring Jazz & the Blues. There's just something so nerve-gratingly annoying about the .. 'blackness' of the lyrics/beat/attitude that irritates me like little else does. General rule: Any song with a lot of  'uh-huh, yeah, a-aight, c'mon c'mon gimme some suga' , I would almost most assuredly despise. Oh, and don't even get me started on Malaysian 'homeboys' who think they're  'down wi' it' . *roll eyes*  Aku tau lah korang gelap macam kicap, but that don't make you no 'nigger', a-aight? Loooosers with a capital 'L' lah, beb.   But, Rock.  Sigh.     DrMucho , who, being gay, listens to nothing but Westlife-esque pop, Cher, and club dance, gave Rock a try once, in the efforts to understand me a little better. I couldn't say he was exactly overcome with the urge to denounce his crap music in lieu of my more real music (*winkz*), but he did notice that  MY  music (as he puts it) is very angry, which, he surmises, is probably the reason for my (sometimes) extremely acid disposition and painfully sharp tongue.   Moi? Acid? Nooooo...    But as for Rock Music being Angry Music? That's like saying Water is Wet. But even though I  know  this, I didn't truly realise it until he pointed it out. Even the 'ballads' are raw.  Oh yaa hoooorrrr....  Even being happy in rock songs has an edge to it. A certain irony.   Yet, there is no other music that touches my soul so intimately. I suppose it could be said that I  identify  with the music, that I understand it. All the nuances of the music: the chord arrangements/progressions, the tempo of the music, the beats, the harmony, sometimes even the disharmony, it's every little thing about it that makes my soul soar with the music. Or rage with the music. *winkz*  Even my favourite love songs are of the rock persuasion! lolz. Seriously! My wedding playlist will read like a rock concert repertoire. Oh! And the man I end up with, whoever he may be, has to love rock at  least  as much as I do! Otherwise, either he or I will  naik gila , oi!! ;op  BTW, I've sworn to, without further question or hesitation, marry the man who spontaneously dedicates my ultimate  favourite  love song to me. Yes, it's of the rock genre. No, it has absolutely NO lyrics whatsoever, but for me, that song describes  everything  love means to me. lolz. Yes, the Power of music. Or more accurately, the Power music holds over me!  Just to give you an idea of what I think a good love song is, I'll throw in Silverchair's "Without You" as an example. Now  that's  what I call a  great  love song!!  It is because of rock music that I was inspired enough to pick up the guitar and learn it myself. It was Rock that inspired me to haul my lazy bum out of the house to sign up for drum lessons. (My drum exam is next Wednesday, btw. Wish me luck!) Heck, I even picked up the violin because of Rock too! lolz.   One of the best sensations I've ever felt is the shiver down my spine when I hear a particularly good acoustic arrangement.  *Shiver*  There's nothing like it in the world!!  urlLink  The Goo Goo Dolls   are the best at this. I've lost count of how many music-orgasms this band has given me.   urlLink Johnny Rzeznik   is my idol, my hero, my fantasy. Ladies and Gents, I give you   urlLink The Most Beautiful Man in the World .       But my love for Rock is not at the exclusion of other genres of music. Music is my passion. Rock is my favourite, but I love Music, in general, with a Passion. Classical, Latin, Jazz, you name it. Just not 'nigger' music. ;o) That's why I have made it my Life's Mission to study (and master!) as many musical instruments as possible. I've got the piano and guitar thing down, and am currently working on the violin and drums. Next on the list are the erhu and clarinet. After that, we'll see. *G*   BTW, I just made the downpayment (macam beli kereta!) for a 12-string Maton steel-strings acoustic guitar this afternoon. *swooon* I've been eyeing it for years! Costing me a fair bit, but it's worth every sen! Thank goodness they're letting me pay in installments. I'm in Heaven!!   .. and whatever it is,  urlLink  The Goo Goo Dolls   rock. OK? OK.  Bilalah they all nak datang KL?!?!! Okay lah, I'll settle for Singapore even!!!   Dah lah. Enough rambling for now. I leave you to gaze upon the hypnotizing beauty of   urlLink Johnny Rzeznik  . OMG, he's the stuff XxX dreams are made of. Well, mine anyways. *sigh* Those heavy-lidded eyes. It makes you wonder what you have to do to make them open wide. *lascivious wink*

      Last night was a night of eerie dreams. Okay, one dream, that I remember, but it was definitely eerie.   Maybe I need to drink more  urlLink  organic soy shakes  ???   I dreamt I was in a room, which was empty save for a bare wrought-iron bed frame, and a simple wood table which I was sitting at. I wasn't doing anything in particular, just sitting. Then, one at a time, friends whom I have not seen nor made contact with for several years kept coming through the door and looked around the room as if searching for something. They looked right through me, however, as though I was invisible. Then after looking around awhile, they left without finding whatever it was they came in for.  This went on the whole night. Sometimes, some of them came in more than once, but none of them ever said anything. It spooked me. There was a palpable air of foreboding throughout. No words were passed or exchanged, nor was my presence ever acknowledged. It remains uncertain as to who was the spectre, me or them? But what remained unchanged was the way all of them seem to be searching for something.  One of them, however, came in more frequently than the rest.  HotStuff  was a very close friend of mine in college, but we have barely seen each other since he left for Australia.  He's Bruneian, btw, so even when school is out for the summer, I don't get to see him.  I've seen him maybe twice in the last 4 years when he made short trips to KL, but we used to write each other on a fortnightly basis for the first couple of years and he used to call every year on my birthday.   No, there was never anything between us.  urlLink  MzMin   and I talked about whether purely platonic friendships with males were possible, and for me, he was it. We got along superbly. We could talk for hours and hours about everything, laughed endlessly about the silliest things, flirted outrageously and filthily, and yet, there was  never  a moment where romance ever entered the picture.  I'm expecting a lot of skepticism over all this, but that's up to you. All I am doing is telling it like it is.   He was my date for our Prom, and he played the guitar accompaniment for me when I performed that same night.   Don't  ask about that, it was sooo bad ... *absolutely mortified*  He also should have been the King to my Queen that night.  Dangit! He lost by only two votes!! Ironically,  I  won by only two votes.   It was kind of like having a girlfriend, only not. It was such a comfortable friendship, one that fits you like a second nature. To sum things up, I think he said it best when he once said to me, "Jas, you're like a hug that lasts all day." Yup, he calls me his all-day-long-hug of a friend. Though I'm supposed to be the one who's better with words, he summed it all up in that simple sentence. That is what our friendship was like. A huge hug which lasted all day.   However, communication stalled about a year and a half or so ago. I guess we've both been a little lax about keeping in touch. I know I can get pretty lazy sometimes.  But in my dream yesterday, he would come in every so often, look around, then leave. The more often he came in, his expression became correspondingly more furrowed, more confused. Once in a while, I would softly call out to him, and it was as though he could sense it, although he couldn't hear me, and the more perplexed he would seem.   Finally, he came in, looked around awhile, searching, and his eyes finally rested on me. All at once, tenderness replaced confusion. He smiled gently and softly called out my name.   It was then I woke, filled with this inexplicable sense of dread. I don't know why, but something feels .. unsettled.   I've sent him an email. I hope he answers. Promptly.

      Weddings get to me. They didn't use to, but in the past few years, they have.   I suppose it all started with my cousin's wedding slightly over 2 years ago. She's two years older than me, and we more or less grew up together. We hung out a bit, did lunches, signed up for ice-skating lessons together, shared happy and bitter stories of our love lives, whenever one was currently in existence. I remember when she was telling me about this new guy she was seeing, how she'd known him almost forever since he was her older brother's friend, but they had only just started seeing each other. I loaned her my shoulder to cry on whenever she was lonely for him while he was studying in the US, I lent her my ear whenever she needed to blow off steam whenever they had an argument. Six years later, they married. Eight years on, they celebrated their son's first birthday.  I wept at her wedding. At the time I wasn't sure why I did. I just attributed it to heightened emotions. When I thought about it, I would be her age in two years. I shuddered at the thought of marriage in two years time.  Too many weddings than I can recall have passed since then, many of which were of friends of the same age, whom I went to school with. Some of them I had known since I started school at 7, some of them whom I had known later, but became close to. Most of the weddings were of girls I was - am - friends with, but were never particularly close to. Attending all those weddings, I never really got teary, with the exception of my cousin's, of course. Like I said, none were particularly close friends. This year, and the next two or so, my diary will be filled with the weddings of friends whom I am actually close to.  Today, I attended the  urlLink wedding  - akad nikah - of  MsBoo . I've known her since .. I can't even remember. We spent our primary and secondary schooling years in the same school, and were always on friendly terms. The years after our schooling saw us maintaining that friendship, mainly through the  urlLink  GirlyGirl   network. I guess I never told her how honoured I felt that she invited me to witness such an important event in her life, and to share her joy today. Anyway, the point is that of all the weddings I've attended to date, hers was more personal than all the others.   I knew her when she was still a  budak Darjah 4 . I knew her high school. Today, she became somebody's wife.   I felt such a pang seeing her all dressed up for her wedding. She was so calm, so composed. So ready. I watched her demurely sit on the cushion in the masjid, listening to her very-very-soon-to-be husband recite the akad. I watched her serene expression as the lafaz was accepted by the wali and witnesses. She looked very grown up. She was all grown up.   Seeing her so composed helped me hold back my own tears. I don't know what I was tearing over, but her composure saved my own. However, had I been closer to her, no doubt there would be no holding them back. I can only imagine what it must have been like for the other Girls, who are all much closer to her than I.    "Min, do you think things will change after I get married?" "Duh!"  "I don't want things to change."   I know too well what that feels like. The first time I heard those words, I was the one who spoke them. The circumstances, however, were extremely different.  He  would be marrying and leaving me behind. I didn't want things to change. Well, I did want them to change, but not that way.  Marriage. All these friends have grown up, taking on new responsibilities willingly, embracing them with open arms. The thought of a committment of that scale makes me want to run to the ends of the world.   You see, marriages seem so ... cheap, what with the frequency of divorces nowadays. I don't condemn people who settle for divorce. As my mother once told me, you make the best decisions you can, but even then, they may ultimately turn out to be wrong. Your only options then are to either sleep in the bed you made, or admit your mistake and start over.   Egoistical me has a problem with admitting my mistakes. It doesn't mean that I don't - especially when it's especially glaring - but I just don't like to. Therefore, I avoid anything which could possibly end up being a mistake. Call it preemptive, call it chicken, but the point is, I hate taking risks. Factors of your life involving only you are by far easier to control, hence less the risk. When someone else enters the equation, wooo hooo! There's no way you can control someone else's thoughts or feelings, and that's risking a lot that things might not go so peachy.  I've just realised what a control freak I might actually be. Aduh.  o_O  Thing is, I'm not ready to be responsible for someone else. I've got quite a bit of growing up to do before I'm ready to allow my globe of responsibility to encompass someone else besides just me. Yes, yes. I know how selfish it sounds, but like I said, I have a lot of growing up to do yet. Responsibility for someone else is no piddling matter, and if I can't even be fully responsible for   myself   yet, how to take care of someone else? And when I finally do open myself up to it, I want to be sure that I actually  can  do it. All in good time. And just like most people, I only want to go through it once. I hope for it, I pray for it.  But despite not being ready for marriage myself, weddings get to me. I'm aware of just how much dedication it takes to make a committment like marriage, and I'm in awe that these couples have it in them.   And when I think about the responsibility of taking care of someone else, I sometimes think that it might be nice to give part of myself unconditionally, willingly, and derive joy from it.   And I think that it might be nice to have someone to unconditionally, willingly be responsible for me, to care about my every need, and that I could give him joy by it.  And I think it might be nice to have that for the rest of my life.  Now I know why I get teary at weddings.

      It's been an ... interesting .. two weeks. A lot has happened, a lot to think about, yet, nothing really happened at all. It's weird. But like the title sez,  ODD  thoughts. ;o)  These past two weeks, I found myself reaquainting myself with many people I haven't seen, or have barely seen in years. It all started, I suppose, with the   urlLink GGWeekend  . Details of the weekend can be found  urlLink here  and  urlLink here , so there's no real need for me to be repeating after everyone over that.  The   urlLink GirlyGirls  . Aaah, how much less colourful my life would be without them! Bless you, girls. Although I must honestly admit that I'm not as close to some of them as they are with each other, it's so wonderful knowing that if you're ever in need, there will always be someplace you can fall back on. Despite not being as close, I know that should any one of them need my help, I would be there in a second.  That weekend we did nothing more than enjoy each other's company. Okay, okay. There was a bit (LOT!!) of running around to 'meet schedules' etc. but  essentially  we did nothing more than just enjoy each other's company.  I found that to be a rare event for me. I don't get to do that much anymore. I don't think I have since the days of slumber parties at   urlLink MzMin  's way back when we were still in high school. The weekend brought back all those feel-good feelings. Worries were left at home, late nights and wee hours of the morning spent playing gin rummy  (  Ed :  Where   urlLink MrsNads   made a super Grand Slam which left the rest of us in the dust)  over idle chatter, girly self-spa sessions, gossiping, and on one night, an impromptu, though (thankfully!) short-lived farting contest.  Yes, girls fart. Some more loudly than others, one louder than most. *snicker*   Nothing of great significance happened that weekend, yet, the weekend was in itself unsurpassably memorable. At the risk of sounding cliche, I'll never forget that weekend. I'll always remember how doing absolutely nothing with friends, real friends, can be so good, so essential for my inner well-being. I'll never forget, either, how necessary it is to have REAL people for friends; people who don't see the point of playing mind games, people who are truly sincere, people who are essentially, fundamentally good. Bless you, girls. Much love from me.  Sometime during the past week I also met up with a friend from my A-Levels days, whom I haven't seen in, oh, almost a year. We shall refer to him, henceforth, as  TheHusband .  Hehe. No, no story. Just a long-standing joke.  Sexy, sexy boy. The very strongly silent type, but you know how purr-a-licious them brooding-types can be. *wink* We barely exchanged 20 words the whole one-and-a-half years of A-Levels, but on the 6-hour bus ride to Pangkor (post-grad celebration trip), we were exchanging life stories as if we were long-lost childhood friends. Anyway, we went out for dinner, and spent the whole night chatting, sharing our joys and disappointments.  And then there were all those people I dated in the past calling me up again. It's amazing how years went by without a word from them, then several called up in the space of two weeks. They were just calling to say hi, which isn't as suspicious as it might normally be, coz I parted on friendly terms with most of them.  Not like there were many...  However, with all of them, things just picked up where we left off - as amiable friends. They've always been in the back of my mind, and apparently, as I have been in theirs. It just made me see how friendships are capable of transcending time. The years in between melted away as if they never existed.  I don't know why I'm writing about all this, really. Alah, panjangnya cerita! I've always been verbose. My whole point is, I guess I have more friends out there than I initially thought. There are times where I sometimes have no idea where, or who to turn to, and it throws me into such despair. I guess I do the opposite of taking friends for granted. I don't give them their due credit. These two weeks have shown me that there are people out there who care about me, about my well-being, even if I don't know it. As they say, everyone has at least one guardian angel. I've only just realised how many I really have. I should count my blessings more often.  Thanks, every one of you. For so much.

      I've just started working. It's exhausting. Most perplexing, however, is that it's more exhausting when you're not really doing anything. No, check that. When you actually have work to do, then it's a good, accomplished kind of exhaustion. When you're sitting around waiting for the clock to show 5:30pm, then it's just plain weary.   A lot has happened since my last update, the best being  urlLink  MsBoo's Hen Weekend  . Will write about that soon, when I have the energy. I just typed in this entry for update's sake. No, I haven't disappeared, I'm momentarily out for the count. I must, however, let it be known now that  urlLink  MsBoo's Hen Weekend   was every bit as good as it promised to be. I love all you  urlLink  GirlyGirls  .  Work. *Shudder* To think this will be my life for the next 30+ years. It's depressing.
