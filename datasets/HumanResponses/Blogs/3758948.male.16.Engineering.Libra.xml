      There's this person X whom I really can't stop thinking of, everything X does stirs different kinds of emotions within me, be it sadness, happiness.. it's just strange. I mean... argh I'm feeling painful again... that ache in the heart...  There are just a few things I am afraid in my life... balloons, babies (I'm afraid of hurting them you see), insects, and ... being forgotten. That's the one that injures the most... and just trying to imagine into the future and seeing this stuff...   I mean the feeling of being forgotten... just think about it... i'm so afraid...

      Riiight, here's my report on my Client number 2124084E. Name: Elix Tan. Age 16... blah blah blah.   Comments: He's enervated, and yes he is consciously aware of his health, and he's worried. All I can do right now is to try to distract him with possibilities, optimistic ones mind you. Although it doesn't seem to be working. Depression is sinking bad in, oddly I can't find the reason why.  It's inquisitive how and why his friends and his bro are able to lift his moods... So far I will have to depend on that for now, but I desperately need more equipments!   And that brings me back to the reson of this mail. I would like to obtain valuable resources from the GA(Guardian Angels) Co. to help me in my client's condition.  You know how to contact me... and thanks for the time.

      Okay, this is my day number two on the campus, and yes it is boring. Lets see... they went through the same old rules on being late (must every teacher do that?) And erm ya, the programming teacher was like insulting our intelligence (like duh, I know how to click file and new... and save too) And erm, ya. Practical was (it's going to be like secondary D&T... which sucks) and overall... day 3 to 2352358235 isn't looking very bright either. I'm so glad my bro and friends are always there to support me when I fall, and I hope I can support them if they do fall. I mean my bro is really a nice person leh, always smiling... (that's good) It's amazing how he has a diploma in marine biology (woah! ya i noe ;) ) So yar. Marcus being his own... self. And then I met Rabe'ah and Sya, nice gals. (ooo they have emails, let me add them to msn...) Now what next? hm yar have to fork out cash to buy textbooks and tools... (tools are 90+?) And hm yar... yar... yar... ... ... yar. Yar. I dunno, I'm feeling odd, like... as if I am non-existant. No idea why I feel non-existant... but hm... (sinks into deep thoughts)

      Tried to wake up at 6:00am so I can get to the campus on time to meet my brother and Marcus, thank goodness I reached there on time. Then we have breakfast (I had sandwiches... but I felt sick eating it), then the both of them went off to their classes, and I made s hort trip to the library to do a bit of revising.  Then it was time for the first lesson, WAA I believe. The teacher wasn't exactly what I have in mind, but I guess I can close one eye and not bother with it. Overall, no comments for this boring lesson.  Lunch - couldn't find Bro and Marcus (why am I forever hanging out with them? I have no idea ^^;; But they're nice, I like them =) ) Had a packet of lime centered biscuits (argh they were so sweet, I couldn't finish it and had to throw it away... wasted...) And before that I fell into a drain (I wasn't seeing where I was going) and then (the zip of my bag broke cause it got stucked and I pulled too hard).  Then I had CATS, forever checking my watch... the teacher (Mr Hock I belive) ers too much, but he does make an attempt to strike conversations with individuals. But by then I was so bored and tired, when I was asked to present my views on creativity, I was muttering to myself instead of presenting it in my usual confidence voice.  Not so bad, tried to sms Bro but it didn't get through, so I thought I'll take a gamble and go to the Atrium... There they are! Bought C prgramming book, followed the both of them to (for my bro's case change notes, marcus's case buy notes)  Then what did we do? Ah yes went to ECE office, tried (futilely) to get my timetable for monday changed to an earlier time, and add Maths 2 module (I have to drop Maths 1 to take maths 2, argh so problematic forget it hehe)  Then it's bye bye time, not so bad.  After that when I reached home I went to check if the pool was opened, it wasn't, although the webpage said 4th of May... grrr... how long has it been already?  Anyway, tired now, but I don't think I'm going to sleep yet. Bro is, but I guess I'll just pack my bags, draw a bit... then perhaps take the night off to deal with my EZ-link problem and get some clothes for Poly life. I mean I only have 2-3 pairs of clothes that goes with jeans... (wouldn't want people to think that I wear the sam clothes everyday and such haha) And besides... It has been a few years (when was the last time? ...) since I got new clothes even... all I wear are the casual (freebie jogathon) t-shirts.... haha.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, I got my clothes (bought a lot of them, sheesh I really DO like shopping XD) spend over $130 (OMG!!! I never spend that much in my whole entire life!) Really, I think I should get a job! Then I can buy as many stuffs as I want! Like... a new handphone! And er... a new Discman! and more discs! And Playstation 2! HEhehehehehehe (forms evil plan in his head)

      Hm I don't know what to feel... excited perhaps? School is beginning tomorrow and worries are surfacing. Like what if I mess up as always and... hm... actually I just have to set my goal... I want my diploma in 3 years time! (can they make it shorter...? like er 2 years?) XD

      Hm the "Real One" is fine now... and yet my duty as his guardian angel never ceases. I am to keep watch of him everyday, and let him take my role as he wanders around his life facing numerous problems..  Yes, I am his split personality - the more dominant one though. His other split selves have went to sleep, and I have to say that's a good thing cause Yonglin has pretty much messed them up. Zodiscus is one of them(whom, yes whom, most of his childhood and magickal side resides...), Marci is another one, mature and passionate (semi-evil self but we've grown to like him somehow)...   But still he adorns me everyday, and it is my job to see him through. I fear his darker sides are arising... his doubts of a new life in the campus is traumatic...  He cannot forever use me as his shield...  Elixias Everborn - Journal from the Forbidden Nights

      Hm after that session I am left tired... feel like sleeping. That is odd... it was quite some time since I felt like sleeping so much... I'll just help mom mop the floor, then go to sleep, so enervated and lethargic..   Or is it because of my darkside? I wonder haha... at least right now my much more angelic side is showing... although a sleepy one... zzz.zz.zz.z.z.z.z.z.z

      12 years of an uneventful childhood and an extra 4 years of solitude has turned me into a beast of burden - the much more demonic self  hidden in the deepest and darkest folds of my mind, feeding off my negative energies and growing as it slumbers. Yet today, it has awaken... -sigh- the many horrors it can still achieve never fails to horrify me...  Sounds like a horror story of some sort isn't it? But yes, I am a thick tome, of horror, suspense, sci-fi, romance, fantasy all rolled into one. And the current chapter of my life is a deep and forbiddening one, the pages yellow as yet another page of depression begins. My poetic juices are definitely returning, but the words and story I am yet to weave will be of eternal darkness.  Siblings - little devilish imps that comes in adorable disguises. I guess I finally snapped, they never listened. (I'll spare you the details). No i didn't cane them,  but I did gave them a few spankings (taking my mom's job?). That's not so bad, but then imps can never outwit a demon (yesh i'm referring to me). The control I have over them (although brief) was overpowering. I scolded them till they cry, (yes my words hurt) And I didn't attack them physically as much as I did psychologically (now that injures the most). I fear my deepest and most darkest of all emotions... cause I can never control it... and at the end it just leaves me devasted and lost, in a grey world of forever despair and guilt...  At least the wild (violent) beast within me had been tamed, although the power I have within me is still not enough and is continuously struggling to keep my demonic ways in control.  When will I conquer my blackest of feelings... and seek the Elysium that other privileged ones have...?

      Yesh I got my own spot on Blogspot (no pun intended... hm no wait this is a cold joke..) And after Blogspot rejected my username 5 times and blog address 1 time... sheesh  Yup I got my blog, now I'm wondering what to do with it. Yup it's my Dreamscape, now I wouldn't have to go to my website and edit the html code so often anymore. That means I can start continuing my story. Right.   Lets continue with my daily rants =) So I am now in Ngee Ann Polytechnic... I got my notes (whoa, help!), I got my drawing to do... somehow the 6 months of holiday began to miss me... (or the other way round) and it's haunting me already.   But then another part of me is looking forward to the once again traumatic days. I wonder why... hm the pschotic side of me is awakening... I can feel it... (yes it's altering my primary functions, notice my pathethic grammatical and spelling errors yet?)   I'll go work on my drawing, argh bye ;) I'll haunt you with an incomplete blog and make you suffer!

      I dunno, so confused. Happy or sad? Sad or happy? I cannot tell. So troubled, yet not at the same time. Argh, what to do?  Anyway, right now, there's just one thing for me to do. That is to score well for the upcoming common tests. Minimum results must get 2ADs, 4A+s... but that's not what i want! EWWWWW....  I want 6ADs, but if I can't, 4 ADs and 2 A+s are good.  It's alright to dream...

      Hey today is such a wonderful day. I dunno why seriously... but then I feel so much more happier and carefree... it's like a whole load taken off my chest. ^^  Ian, he plays Ragnarok too, and we're both on the same server. So once we finish our work we can play together hehe. Like in .hack like that, whoa so cool.  Terence? Hey he's not a bad guy either.Smart aleck guy from ITE who likes to read up on military stuff.  Went swimming, haha. for a good 2 hours i think. Thought iw ould swim more but then leg cramp halfway. Calf muscles swelled and it hurt like hell, limped back home (still hurts)... then I got a new mobile handphone (my second actually, since the death of my old one) and a new number. it's 96921319 i think.  Now what... hm... yeah zhong ling from japanese tsubasa called. She said that there's a summer festival at changi soon! Whee~! everyone there will be dressed in kimonos and stuff, and they're going to speak in JAP! MY GOODNESS that rocks!  And hm, lets see. That's about it ^^ haha, see ya all till next time!

      Yup, the same old lectures again. Can't seem to understand what connotations are. Well that's fine, then after that was CATS. I really don't understand why people keep treating me as invisible and not even consider my ideas at all.  &nbsp;  And... after that I did a bit of programming. Areus was online. Chatted a bit with him. Then I went back home. Then went swimming. Then came home to play Ragnarok... Oh my goodness... so mad... and frustrated. Spend 4 hours on that game and literally gain nothing at all. No exp (people have to steal my kill all the time, and when they don't I'm always getting mobbed).  &nbsp;  Argh, argh, argh, argh.  &nbsp;  Sometimes, I just wish that my wishes to leave this planet will one day come true. you know, like forget everyone literally... and just wander into a land like that of Ragnarok or some other equivalent stuff... one with a great vast of rich plains for me to explore, sights and views to see... Real life staying at home and going to school isn't really my idea of Adventure... I NEED ADVENTURE, something that not even the Adventure Seekers Club can provide... &nbsp;

      私は私の翼を見つけた... Yes I have finally found my wings. My past is now behind me and I willl never look back at it again. Yeah I feel like a different person now, and people out there you better watch out! ;)  そう私を... 忘れていた Well I'm forgotten, it's always like that. But then there could be exceptions. I don't mind if I am non-existant in your life anymore, cause I have no reason to be. I don't know who you are (you know who you are), cause I have reformatted my memories and now I'm brand new again XD Well actually, I wasn't angry with you or anything, but then well I guess I should just stay out from your life ;) Besides, you have other people to fall onto. I'm insignificant, but I don't mind.  Ragnarok の生命の新しい賃貸借契約か Yup, Ragnarok is indeed a dream come true for me. A land filled with endless possibilites and adventure every corner. No more sitting at home.. but instead exploring the vast, beuatiful world whilst getting to know more friends.  If I can't pay for it, I'll jolly while play on a private server.  友人は、どこに彼らであるか。 Friends, if you can still remember me... I hope please email me k? we can still keep in touch and such. ;)

      Okay... right. been quite some time since I've last updated my blog... yeah. Well recently, I've found the game Ragnarok Online, and I have to say it's a dream come true. After so many years...   Too bad it's a 15 day trial... good things don't last.    And yeah, pass few days have been stormy, but I've gotten used to it. Who cares if I'm forgotten? I'm tired...    Seriously, if I'm forgotten, so mote it be. Who cares if you've found someone else to talk to, I'm always forgotten. Most of my friends (most, not some of the few rare nice ones) only come to me when they need me. What do you think I AM!?   Yup, that's it. I don't care if we were good friends before, but really, if you hurt me... I can say I'll never want to see you again.    Sometimes, for me, relationships should be kept in a range of strangers... at least if anything happens (which won't since we'll be strangers) none of us will get hurt.   So yeah. God, just let me forget this mystery person I have in mind kk? ^^ Thank you lord.

      As time passes, it seems as if the bonds between me and my... brother are weakening. Yes I'm referring to Desmond. It's fading so fast, and I guess I finally had a good wake up call. Sometimes, you get Deja Vu... and it sems as if, this time round, you're not going to make the same mistakes again. I won't, cause this Cole inside me... is really reliable. =D

      I don't know, the few recent events have changed me entirely. I've watched, and observed, and now I feel that it is time to bring out another mask of my own. I call him Cole, a serious, professional individual who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. The reason why I 'summoned' him is cause... I believe it is time to take charge of my life... no longer will I let my problems sink in deeper any longer, but I'm going to look and view at them from another point of view.   Yet, before I switch to this new GA, there's this poem that caught my eye.   "From childhood's hour I have not been  As others were — I have not seen  As others saw — I could not bring  My passions from a common spring —  From the same source I have not taken  My sorrow — I could not awaken  My heart to joy at the same tone —  And all I lov'd — I lov'd alone —  Then — in my childhood — in the dawn  Of a most stormy life — was drawn  From ev'ry depth of good and ill  The mystery which binds me still —  From the torrent, or the fountain —  From the red cliff of the mountain —  From the sun that 'round me roll'd  In its autumn tint of gold —  From the lightning in the sky  As it pass'd me flying by —  From the thunder, and the storm —  And the cloud that took the form  (When the rest of Heaven was blue)  Of a demon in my view —   Edgar Allan Poe."

      In my past life I was probably a sailor... seriously. Cause the sea and the night skies were the thing for me. And I would have braved many troubles and problems like what I am doing now, yet somehow managed to survive despite the darkess hours.   Maybe that is why, right now when I look at the sky, I'm always feeling lost... cause the night sky for me somehow is always obscured by clouds... and where I live there's always no stars in the sky. Sailors need their stars to guide them home... so where is mine?   I was walking back from home from Christina's house. And halfway I told God with my deepest feelings to show me a star in this unlit night. Just a single ray of hope to tell me I am not lost in this sea... Right now as I am typing this blog, I am still looking outside hoping that I can catch a single glimpse of this star.   But I didn't see any...  - Yonglin

      I'm going to add background music, I know, I once told someone that it's kiddish and all, but then maybe I was wrong. There's always time to put a little midi into a blog... (maybe i should  put mp3... shouldn't be much of a prob hehe) Well the background music is Eternity, from FFX-2, and the lyrics below are for a song called the Boat Song (Or Wind?) from Lunar: Silver Star Story. Never really played the game but the girl sang this piece of song while the characters were suppose to be travelling to a place called Meribia.   urlLink Click here to listen to the Boat Song   Boat Song Lyrics - Lunar: Silver Star Story =========================================== (Jap Version) mishiranu kuni kara umi o watatte                fuku kaze wa ne yasashiku mimi no                ushiro o sugiru                                  nee oshiete hoshii no                            hito wa dare mo ga                               tomadou omoi o mune ni ikiteiru no               From an unknown country across the sea a wind blows gently past my ears.

Fate has stirred my heart in vain. It's only the wind...   (Japanese Translation) As travelling across the sea, from the unknown country, the wind passes gently behind my ears, will you tell me if people live with the same bewildering feeling inside?  To love someone, or to be loved by someone- I wonder what those feelings are like? I can only feel vaguely from afar. I want to cherish the feeling that has just started inside me, the fate trembles my heart like the wind.   (English) Wishing on a dream that seems far off Hoping it will come today.  Into the starlit night, Foolish dreamers turn their gaze, Waiting on a shooting star.  But, what if that star is not to come? Will their dreams fade to nothing? When the horizon darkens most, We all need to believe there is hope.  Is an angel watching closely over me? Can there be a guiding light I've yet to see? I know my heart should guide me, but, There's a hole within my soul.  What will fill this emptiness inside of me? Am I to be satisfied without knowing?  I wish then for a chance to see, Now all I need,   Is my star to come...

      Finally the end of the week, and finally I can get my laptop. They were late, well as in the goods came in late (turns out to be the cause of a traffic jam, can't blame anyone for that can we?) Well got the laptop, and we aren't entirely late for class (bro came along with me, and so I'm grateful)   Then during PP class I was well creating a bed time for the teacher... I guess he wasn't exactly happy. Well I guess I don't mind (why should I anyway? XD) But hm...   Turns out my computer is unable to connect to the wireless lan, bro says I need to get a wireless lan card or something? I dunno, I wish I were better at hardware and computer stuff... I mean what's the point of having the skills in C programming and html if I don't know how to even troubleshoot my computer and such?   And nope, I'm not really unhappy, just have a lot to think about. Bro was worried for me, he says I look depressed. (I just stare at him and look blur... must be taking over Veron's reaction, she used to do that a lot too...) Well I mean my bro is very nice to me, and well...   Anyway went to 543 to get my proggys installed, but then they're not going to serve anyone so I might as well go there next monday.   Well I left poly at around 3:10 pm, then I waited a while for the bustop. Not sure why, but everytime I have a lot to think about and need a lot of time to plan stuff, I would take long walks while I think. That's what I did, I walked home. Carrying boxes with ac adapter and floppy drive in one hand, and the laptop on the other, I embarked on a journey home that last 1 hour. Yes I walked home and it took 1 hour. 3:15 pm to 4:15 pm lolz... Yesh I can be wierd sometimes, but I really need to be alone so I can think and sort out my thoughts.   Well nothing much until the person who rented a room in our house left (for good) so I "inherited" a room for myself.... but turns out I will have to share with one of my brothers. That's okay I guess. Lets see... then we packed the room and now I'm here, sitting with my pc (yes in the room, before it was in the living room) and well I guess I am sorta happy, but -looks at homework and books and notes- I guess this two days...    Anyway, meeting my three most precious sec school friends tomorrow at West Mall, 7:30 pm so hehe... I'm looking forward to seeing the old gang again... missed them badly... all of em.

      Yeah, Crystal. I tried. you told me to try talking to Desmond again. I tried.  But then the response he gave me... it still feel odd. He's still cold towards me for some odd reason. And it's frustrating. I try to talk, but he seems so busy. I mean... he isn't as friendly as before and he is definitely treating me like a stranger already. I tried to be nice, cracked some jokes. But then he just left without a word. No "I gtg, bye." or anything. He just left the convo. I don't get it. Does he hate me or something? Damnit that guy has gotta relax...  I'm feeling so irated... but then having no output of my feelings is just driving me over the edge. Man i can't stand it when people hate me... it drives me nuts. First, I have to figure out what's it that they're ignoring me for. Second, it's damn freaking awkward. It just simple drives me insane.  I just want someone to listen to my problems... it's been so long since someone showed me they care.... I feel so alone, need to cry... My dreams to live in another world still calls me.... to abandon all problems and lead a simple life... one filled with grandeur of maginificent castles and fantastic architecture... one filled with endless possibilities and numerous adventures... one where freedom is free and there are no chains to bind you down...  Perhaps... -he- is calling out to me again... perhaps I may need to switch to my -darkside-....

      Meh, feeling odd today. Went swimming in school again, now my chest and some other muscles are aching. Lecturers as unclear as usual... but oh well. Meh, I'm feeling down, cause people usually comes to me when they need help. Meh. Or maybe i'm too sensitive. Meh, I need to be more sociable. Meh, and I am not a nerd. Yeah. The song below is how my heart feels now. http://www.animelyrics.com/game/finalfantasyx2/ (Game) Final Fantasy X-2: real Emotion (N/A) Opening Song What can I do for you? What can I do for you? What can I do for you? I can hear you What can I do for you? What can I do for you? I can hear you What can I do for you? ano hi kokoro no kanata ni egaiteta basho ni iru tohou ni kuretetari suru keredo mou modorenai I pictured myself somewhere far in my heart that day It becomes dark in the distance, but I can no longer return yume ni mita katachi to wa nanimokamo ga chigau genjitsu ni wa... memai sae suru The shape I saw in my dream Is different from everything I become dizzy from reality riaru na sekai ni yureteru kanjyou maketakunai mou tada hashiru shikanai kono mune ni kikoetekuru kimi wa hitori jyanai The feeling of swaying in the real world I don't want to lose The only thing I can hear from my heart is to run. You are not alone What can I do for you? I can hear you What can I do for you? What can I do for you? I can hear you What can I do for you? kesshite furimuki wa shinai anata ni wa toyoranai nanika ga areba kanarazu suguni kite kureru kara I won't turn back, I won't rely on you Because if something happens, you'll always come to me quickly ima boku ni dekiru koto sore wa shinjiru koto... shinjitsu nara kono mune ni aru The only thing I can do now is to believe... The truth is in my heart riaru na sekai ni yureteru kanjyou sasaeru no wa sou anata ga oshietekureta subete ima no watashi daraka, hitori jyanai The feeling of swaying in the real world Holds me up You taught me everything I know That is me now So, I am not alone What can I do for you? I can hear you What can I do for you? I can hear you riaru na sekai ni yureteru kanjyou kanjitemo anata ga me o tojita nara soko ni iru kizuna ga aru dakara, hitori jyanai The feeling of swaying in the real world Even if you feel it If you close your eyes, I will be there There is a bond between us So, you are not alone riaru na sekai ni yureteru kanjyou maketakunai mou tada hashiru shikanai kono mune ni kikoete kuru kimi wa hitori jyanai The feeling of swaying in the real world I don't want to lose The only thing I can hear from my heart is to run. You are not alone What can I do for you? I can hear you What can I do for you? I can hear you What can I do for you? I can hear you What can I do for you?
