      so i've set up this blog to share information with whomever's interested in my trip to india, and to see how i like this blogging thing.  seems better than spamming a bunch of people with emails with large attachments.  me and alan have been hanging out for the past few hours getting ready to go to the airport for my 1:35am flight.  i have a 14 hour flight to signapore with a refueling in hong kong.  during the 8 hour layover in singapore i'm planning on taking the free tour of singapore on some government bus.  alan wasn't that enthusiastic about the tour, but then again i'm not all that enthusiastic about anarchy or freebsd.  we went and got japaneese food, where kenji the bartender made us  urlLink ocha-zuke .  my last bit of civilized food for the next few weeks i guess.  so need to head to SFO.  looks like i get into bangalore at 11pm monday night in india, i have no idea what that will be in america.  i'll have to figure that one out.  i'll try to figure out how to post pictures when i get there.

       urlLink     This temple in Mysore, was absolutely packed, so we didn't go in.  By packed, i don't mean Disneyland packed, well actually, maybe i do.  I don't know how packed Disneyland gets.  But this was really packed.  We would have had to wait on line for hours to get in.  So we didn't go in.  We looked at it from outside, and went off to other better temples, that weren't quite so packed.

       urlLink    This was my first experience seeing wild monkeys.  Alan had mentioned the Monkey Invasion Prevention bars on all the houses, but i didn't really see any wild monkeys until i got to Mysore.  So these are some monkeys climbing around the barn that houses the chariot they use to lug about the idol stored in the Chamundeshwari temple for festivals.

       urlLink    We visited Mysore Palace at night before heading to Hassan.  There was a police band playing horribly in front.  It sounded kind of like those Italian wedding bands, just a lot worse.  There was a mob listening to them, thousands of people in front of the palace.  Apparently some descendant of the King of Mysore (who's now a member of parliament) still lives in the palace.  I doubt he was enjoying the music much either.

       urlLink    This is one hell of restaurant, in a beautiful hotel.  Expensive for bangalore, meaning rougly US prices, but excellent food, and a beautiful place.  The only disappointment was their piano, which was extraordinarily out of tune.  I tried playing something on it, but it sounded so terrible (the piano, not my playing), that i decided to stop, and go eat.

       urlLink    It was raining pretty hard on the way back from work.  And when it rains, all the crazies on the two wheelers need to find shelter.  So they end up huddled under whatever shelter availabe, and free up traffic!  So ironically, what's usually a 45 minute drive back from work (being stuck behind these low power two wheelers), was only 20 or so, despite the rain.

       urlLink    Last friday, Bangalore celebrated it's first ever beer bash, continuing the time honored Sunnyvale tradition of getting drunk after work on friday.   However, I must to admit, that beer bash in Sunnyvale has fallen on hard times, and is now only a glimmer of it's former glorious self.  I don't blame this on a plummeting stock price, low moral, engineers preferring to go home than drink with their coworkers and managers, or because all the really enjoyable drunks have either left or been fired, or because instead of holding the beer bash outside, (where beer bash only ended well after dark), we now hold them inside in a crappy little kitchen on the second floor without enough chairs.  I blame it on people not drinking beer!  Beer bash lost it's flare once instead of just being about having a beer with coworkers, it started to involved all sorts of greasy catered food, raffles, contests, and such like.  But most of all, i blame it on the extraordinarily sugary, nausating beverages made by  urlLink SoBe .  At beer bash, people are supposed to drink beer, not artificial sugary juices! That's why it's specifically called beer bash.  Wine is okay, beer is better, but SoBe is just unacceptable. Regardless, I feel a special pride in having brought this tradition all the way across the pacific (or the atlantic if your going west to east, i came west to east, so i'll consider it as having come across the pacific, despite having been born and raised in new jersey, from where the eastern atlantic route would have doubtlessly been more efficient and cost effective).   Me and Gaj were able to convince a number of the newbies that part of the Sunnyvale tradition is that late comers to beer bash must sing a song.  This is clearly untrue.  We're engineers.  We can't sing.  None the less, the festivities included (to my surpise) a rousing song, sung with gusto, by engineering manager, apparently some kind of Andhra resistance song about sticking it to the police, and the Nizam (king) of Hydrabad.

       urlLink    Hindware has virtual monopoly on toilets in india.  It's the most aptly named company ever.  I'm guessing they wanted the  hind  part to be more like the  hind  in  urlLink Hindustan Aeronautics .  They failed.  I giggle every time i see one of their toilets.  Which is practically every time i go to the toilet, since the only other manufacturer is  urlLink Parryware  (also vitreous), and they seem to be very unpopular.  At any rate, what i find even funnier, is that they have the stylized  vitreous  through the horizontal line of the  H  on all their toilets.  Not knowing what vitreous meant, I consulted  urlLink dictionary.com :   vit&#183;re&#183;ous  &nbsp;&nbsp;  (v t r - s)     adj.    Of, relating to, resembling, or having the nature of glass; glassy.    Obtained or made from glass.    Of or relating to the vitreous humor.     [From Latin  vitreus , from  vitrum ,  glass .]  I think vitreous is a really good sounding word, especially for such an inconsequntial definition.  Sounds like virtous, victorious, or viscous (which is one of the great words).  something to consider: what would they hyroglyph for viscous be?  At any rate, vitreous hindware, when you say it together sounds really interesting.  Kind of like a jingle.  It could be the name of a character in a P.G. Wodehouse novel, (my personal favorite is Gussie Finknottle).  It works well in a sentence: &quot;Vitreous Hindware and I are going snorkeling!&quot;  Okay, it's quite possible I find this too amusing. To the cultural and practical aspects of sanitary products (produced by hindware); these toilets, while vitreous and attractive, are very uncomfortable.  Hindware's plastic toilet seats are not quite so cushy (for your tushy).  They tend to bite.  Another grave problem plaguing india is that toilet paper is quite scarce, and when available, of remarkably low quality.  However, not too long ago (about 5 years ago) a dramatic innovation came to India, called the  health faucet!   This is the shpritzer to the left of the vitreous toilet pictured above.  While better than nothing (i have not yet subjected myself to a toilet without toilet paper, so i speak without any first hand experience), the health faucet user invariably shpritzes water all over the place, making flooding a common problem in bathrooms in india.

       urlLink      the holy confluence of three rivers, Cauvery, Kapila and Guptagamini (the hidden river) near Tirumakudalu Narsipura.  apparently, in the hindu pantheon rivers are minor deities.  there's some kind of relationship between rivers and mothers that i don't quite understand (i'm guessing that the analogy is that rivers feed the fields the way mothers feed babies). there was a lot of water there this year, so gaj was really excited.  kept on repeating "good monsoon" over and over again.

       urlLink    this was a palace we visited on the way to mysore.  this is tippu's summer palace named dharia daulat.  tippu was the sultan of mysore.  he defeated the british several times (which was a really big deal), and was also defeated a few times, over a period of fifteen years.  in an early defeat, his two sons were taken hostage (he had five others, so this wasn't a big deal).  so then he teamed up with the french, hired them as mercenaries, beat the british a few more times, until arthur wellesley (later the duke of wellington, who really liked  urlLink beef wellington ), finally defeat tippu sultan in 1799, killed him, gave him a hero's burial, and lived in his palace.

       urlLink    me and gaj took a road trip to mysore this weekend.  there's a lot of material from this trip, so i'm going to space out my posts from the trip over the next few days.  we left for mysore on saturday morning.  we rented a car for the trip.  this was for three reasons:    the roads are really bad.  you need a car with a bit more umphf.  we got one of them toyota four wheel drive vehicles. this toyota had a much better chance of escaping ditches, compared to gaj's tiny hyundai accent.   the drivers are really bad.  and driving is really stressful.  rented cars come with drivers here.  so we had a driver do the stressfull driving, and we just sat in the back seat and relaxed.   there aren't any street signs.  so you get a driver who knows the roads and knows where to go.    this is on the road to mysore.  these roads were packed with dogs, oxen, chickens, cows (of multiple species), oxen carrying carts, oxen carrying carts with people, people on bikes, people on bikes with tons of produce strapped on in every place, buses packed with people, and just basically packed with everything but people in cars (there were a few of those too, but nothing compared with the number of cows).

       urlLink    this is a not uncommon sight on the streets of bangalore.  you see the most remarkable things on scooters here.  above you see a family racing along in traffic (you can't really get a sense for the speed in a still, but whatever).  i'll try to get a picture of a woman in a sari tomorrow.  those are just the greatest.

       urlLink    this is the first in what will likely be many posts about traffic here in bangalore, which is unlike anything i've ever seen.  the streets are packed (as you can see above) with buses, 4 wheeled cars, 3 wheeled auto rigshaws, 2 wheeled motorcycles, bicycles, people,  dogs, cows, carts, and trash.  basically, gaj treats the streets like an obstacle course.  so these are the main characteristics of driving in bangalore: lanes are absolutely meaningless, there are no stop signs, few stop lights, 5 way intersections where traffic just weaves its way through, speed bumps at intersections so that cars run don't crash into each other at the speed of light (they prefer a bouncy 50 kpm), and everybody honks constantly.

      so i'll explain why this is necessary in the next post, but i found this hysterical.  when cars go in reverse here, they play music.  i was in the office, and i hear an electric fur elise.  so i figure it's a cell phone.  i ask gaj if it's his.  he tells me, it's some car going in reverse.  so i notice that cars have a wide variety of reverse music.  gaj's car just has a boring beep.  i'm going to see if i can change it to some puccini aria.  that or the theme to batman.

      the flight to bangalore was great.  777s are the greatest.  we got in at 11PM, which made it the end of about 20 hours of flying.  it is immediately clear that bangalore international (formerly Hindustan aeronautics limited), is a very different sort of airport than the three others i'd visited in the previous day. getting through customs was painless, except for these two things.  they forgot to give us the forms for immigration.  so we're all standing half asleep in line (i was surprised they did not have a different line for visitors than for nationals), and we notice every once in a while someone racing to the front of the line, a customs agent yelling out, and the person running back.  finally, somebody realizes that what their doing is getting the immigration forms.  so we all swarm the customs desk, and reform lines frantically filling out the forms.   i get through customs painlessly after that, and proceed to the baggage claim.  directly outside of customs there's an escalator downstairs which ends in a small anteroom, the only exit from which is a door, on the otherside of which is an baggage x-ray baggage check machine, manned by a chubby woman in a sari, working at a government pace.  i don't know why the check bags on arrival, my dad hypothesises that it's to check for spare cows.  at any rate, they check all carry onbags on arrival before you pick up your checked baggage.  checked baggage they check selectively.  they draw a chalk X on the bags to determine which ones need to be checked.  mine had one, but i carried the bag with the X facing away from the bag checkers and they didn't notice.  anyway, as i'm descending the escalator (which terminates in a the small room whose exit is blocked by the baggage checker machine), i notice that the room is packed with people, and that the space at the end of the escalator is booked.  i get to the bottom of the escalator, and i'm hopping up and down as the steps are moving under me, until the mass of people shift so that i can get on stationary ground.  we try to organize the hundred or so people cramped into the tiny room before the x-ray machine, each one averse to relinquishing their space in the swarm at the door.  meanwhile, old women are coming down the escalator despite people shouting in fifty different languages to stay at the top of the stairs.  people are jumping over the side of the escalator, the old women are shrieking, meanwhile the x-ray machinist is continuing at the same slow pace.

      i have confirmed that bangalore is 12 1/2 (?) hours ahead of sunnyvale. i'm writing this down, because it's been troubling me. i'm still trying to get my head around what's happened time wise since saturday. so i took off early sunday morning (1:25 am). and basically, it seemed that my sunday ended when i crossed the date line, which was around 6am PST. so i had a really short sunday. i'm guessing i get that back on the way back to california, and get a really long monday back in exchange or something. though it seems then that this monday has been rather long, since i was in hong kong at 4am this morning, and haven't left that timezone yet, and i'm going to be arriving in india still on a monday. so i have no idea for how many hours it will have been monday for me. suffice it to say that i have no idea how i could possibly be jetlagged, since i have very little idea right now what time it should be. i don't know that writing this out has clarified anything.

      i'm still trying to figure out how to get pictures onto the blog. i tried out shutterfly.com and a couple of the other ones that blogger.com listed on their site, but i really didn't like them. they seemed a lot more to be geared towards publishing photos to the web so that you or someone else could order the prints. and none of them would let you see the pictures at their original resolution which i found particularly aggravating. alan recommended getting a freeshell account... i might do that. i'll deal with that from india.

      i'm almost at the end of my 9 hour layover in singapore.  singapore is really weird.  first of all, the airport is extraordinarily elaborate.  even more so than hong kong.  it's elegant, packed with shops and restaurants, but it also has all sorts of lounges to make people comfortable while waiting.  they have reclining chairs, lounges with tons of TVs, internet just about everywhere, and in general, it's very comfortable, unlike american airports where they intentionally put dividers between all the uncomfortable seats so you can't lie down. i took the department of tourism bus tour thing.  basically all they want, is to tell you where you can come back and spend money.  they point out every food court and row of shops, usually right across the river from each other.  every bridge is a landmark.  my feeling is that since they don't really have much history or landmarks before 1860 something, they're trying to pack them in as fast as possible.  one interesting thing the bizarre tour guide said is that 90% of the population lives in high rises.  they're also reclaiming land all over the place to make the city bigger (they're filling the sea in with dirt from indonesia).  so the tour was kind of boring, as alan had said, but we did get to go on a boat ride on the river, which despite the smoke from the engines was rather pleasant. hong kong was a short layover.  there i didn't leave the airport.  the airport if not as large as the one here, was a lot more fancy.  the only interesting thing that happenned there was that i went outside.  it was incredibly humid.  after 5 years in houston, i've never felt anything like that. that's about it.  nothing very interesting.  hopefully i'll have more interesting tales from india.
