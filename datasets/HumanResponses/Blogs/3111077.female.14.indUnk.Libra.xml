      today was good..i went to flag corps at 4:45 again. larry is doing it! it'll be so weird with a guy in it. i asked him what made him want to do it and he said "uh, duh..the chicks!!" hes a goof-ball. anyway...i got home from flag corps and leah was over and her and stephanie did their mini-society project. yea..thats my day. yesterday was me and ryans 4 months. and i'm supposed to be having a party the 5th but i'm having a little difficulty on who to invite because i'm friends with people of all cliques and if i invite them all, i don't want cliques getting in fights with other cliques..ya kno? so yes, its all very confusing. i wish everyone would just all get along but people have to be so ARRGH!! well i'm gonna go. bye.     song o' da month: you rock my world-jacko

      first i went to school..oh joy. then i stayed after school and went to a r&j discussion because i had nothing better to do, plus i helped autumn with one of her questions. and then autumn and sam left so i was stuck with katie. we danced around the school and made up songs..it was so fun. then we found larry and talked to him for a few and then sarah came and joined our choir..lol. then at practice, we taught the lil kids the fight song and some marching moves. it was hard teaching them suicides ((a move, not a kill)) and after they learned that, the veterans showed them our try-out song ((a janet jackson song)). my mom picked me and katie up and we took her home and then we went to subway because i was starving. after i ate, i went to lil' shack to visit ryan and get some ice cream..but i mostly went to visit ryan. first i went inside but it was too crowded and muggy so i took my moped thru the drive-thru and some kids behind me said "hey, nice ride" so i talked to them for the 15 minute wait because ryan is as slow as a turtle moving through syrup. j/p rye. but i finally got to the window and he told me he was glad to see me and that i made his day. i ordered a lemon crush. then after i left, he told the guy behind him ((bill)) that i was his g/f and bill said, "no making out between the drive thru window!!". funnie stuff. and yea that was pretty much my day. i started another scarf. i'm gonna make this one stri-ped. well its kinda late so i'm gonna go to bed...bye!

      ok maybe i didn't give summer a fair chance. i'm having fun now, i just had to find the right things to do. me and crystal got together and we burned the stuff ryan got me...its like a ritual ((burn bitch burn part 2)). then i spent the night at ashley's house last night. whew i had a blast. lisa ((her cousin)) and stacy ((lisa's sis)) picked me up and we went everywhere lookin for hot guys! we were blasting our music and everyone was starin at us and stacy just flipped 'em all off. fun stuff. we had to go into downtown which was even more fun because even more people stared, lol. yea..good times, good times. then today, we ((me and ashley)) watched "er" and then we went swimming, and after that, we went to her busia's house and she cut the grass and i just kept her company. then we had a 1 hour game of war...and it still wasnt over! but we had to end it because we had to eat dinner. then i went home and we went to the perfect 10 pool guy ((craig))'s house and looked at the pool we wanted to get and we're ordering it tomorrow and we should have it in about 3 weeks since they already had it in stock. its a really nice pool...but expensive. its huge tho, 48 x 28, wow. we have the backyard for it tho. i can't wait! well tata for now!
