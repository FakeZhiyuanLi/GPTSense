      david this is dedicated to you ;)  the village has to be one of the most stupid pointless movies ever! besides the fact it wasnt even scary, my favorite character turned out to be a murderer! i had fun anyway tho cause all my favorites were there and that made it all worthwhile plus it wasnt my money i wasted so thats always good next time we need to go see a REAL scary movie and bailey you have to sit next to me cause your the only one who wont scare me!

       I would love to be your tears, to be born in your eyes, live on your cheeks and to die on your lips.   &nbsp;   I know I'm not a grocery item but I can tell when you're checking me out.    &nbsp;  Is there an airport nearby or is that my heart taking off?    Life without you would be like a broken pencil...pointless.    When I saw you from across the room, I passed out cold and hit my head onthe floor...so I'm going to need your name and number for insurance reasons    &nbsp;

       its never good if the wind blows your skirt up in a walmart parking lot and all the cart guys stop pushing their carts to laugh and point and its even worse when a chinese guy is laughing soo hard he has to stop the car so he wont crash and to top it off its mega bad if your wearing gray nasty panties! HAHAHAHAHA&nbsp; i kinda feel sorry for the poor girl but if she wore a more decent skirt it wouldnt have happened&nbsp;but it was reallllllly funny so im glad she did and off the subject im getting use to my hair cut

       has anyone else noticed how girls' skirts and shorts just keep getting shorter and shorter? its like a magic trick, now you see them, now you don't!&nbsp; i dont know about the rest of you but it grosses me out and i kinda feel sorry for those sleezy ones who feel they need to show it all off cause apart from being shallow and a little extreme, they must be cold! i agree with L, the 30's styles need to come back...

       Why the sun lightens our hair, but darkens our skin?    Why women can't put on mascara with their mouth closed?   Why don't you ever see the headline "Psychic Wins Lottery"? Why is "abbreviated" such a long word? Why is it that doctors call what they do "practice"? Why is it that to stop Windows 98, you have to click on "Start"? Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavor, and dishwashing liquid made with real lemons? Why is the man who invests all your money called a broker? Why is the time of day with the slowest traffic called rush hour? Why isn't there mouse-flavored cat food? When dog food is new and improved tasting, who tests it? Why didn't Noah swat those two mosquitoes? Why do they sterilize the needle for lethal injections? You know that indestructible black box that is used on airplanes? Why don't they make the whole plane out of that stuff? Why don't sheep shrink when it rains? Why are they called    apartments    when they are all stuck together? If flying is so safe, why do they call the airport the terminal? If con is the opposite of pro, is Congress the opposite of progress?

       I met a girl named Tara   And she lived in the heart of America   She liked black caddies,Listened to Puff Daddy   And danced until her legs were sore.   She worked around a corner   At a diner with a grouchy owner   And her boyfriend    Shady dates another girl named Katie,   He loves her definitely maybe…   Don’t think I can take it,   Wake me when it’s over..   She lives so far away,   I wish that it was closer…   I see you everyday,   I’m too scared to go over.   I wonder what she’d say,    I barely even know her…   And how much longer   Will this keep getting stronger?   I wonder what she’s doing    When I’m singing myself to sleep…   Cause he’s a faker,   So seeya later.   I wonder when you’ll realize that she means   A lot more to me…   I saw you in the hallway   When my last class was just over   It was Friday, school was out    Tonight, everything seems to be alright.   I said, “Yo, are you goin to the party at the cove?”   She said,“He’s pickin me up at 6 again,    and I don’t wanna disappoint my boyfriend.”   And she’s starin at his picture hangin in her locker,   She’s tellin all the girls about all the things that he bought her.    I saw what really happened all those time he went for water,   When we were at the movie theatre   Watchin Harry Potter.   He had his hands on   Every single girl he laid his eyes on.   To break it to ya, He’s a pylon.   And even when he kissed her,   He was lookin over starin at her sister.
