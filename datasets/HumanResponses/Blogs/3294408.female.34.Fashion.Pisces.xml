      I could NOT wake up successfully this morning.  I needed someone to pour a very large bucket o'ice water on me.  (Tammy, don't get any ideas for the next time you stay the night!)  The weekend was good.  We went to the Irvine Spectrum to see Nascar 3D and had lunch at The Yard House.  We also hit up the new IKEA in Costa Mesa.  Holy crap that place is HUGE!  If Randy wasn't dragging me along by the hand, I would have definately gotten lost.  We ended up purchasing a few kitchen gadgets like a pizza cutter, some shot glasses and a flour sifter.  You know..."essentials" that a bachelor and bachlorette just didn't have.  Had breakfast with the parental units on Sunday.  They are selling the house and moving to Pennsylvania before the end of Summer.  We get first dibs on all the good furniture and stuff.  I will miss mom and Brian.  I don't know how the little fart dogs will do in cold weather though, They can barely handle a small breeze outside without shaking and running indoors.    I am still trying to get this pain in my right side fixed.  I have more doctor appointments scheduled within the next few weeks.  So we'll see how that goes.

      Damn I'm busy!!  I can't believe how much work I have to do.  I am working on a project and trying to schedule meetings, deal with my hard-to-understand-non-english-speaking co-worker, and find time to go to lunch still *sigh*.  Oh well...at least I have a job, and  fun one at that.  The really great thing is that I don't have to report to a certain boss any longer.  YAY!!!!

      I can't believe how fast this year has gone by so far.  We still have to get the house in order.  I have a bunch of stuff I need to unpack and put away/sell or throw away.  I am looking forward to four days off!  I have Friday thru Monday off, and Randy and I agreed to choose one event only to attend.  We are always booking ourselves for the whole weekend (well I am the guilty one here) and never have time, or are too tired to get shit done.  So we decided to go to a friends' place on Lake Mission Viejo.  It will be nice, relaxing and local.

      Wow...what a gorgeous day!  I am working from home again and the sun is shining, birdies are chirpin and the sky is blue.  The cats are passed out in their usual spots.  Malibu on the floor, Simon in the chair curled up with paw over eyes to shield himself from the world.    We took my mom and stepdad to the airport last night.  They'll be gone for a week in New Joysee.  They're gonna look for a house to purchase in Pennsylvania or somewhere near there, and hang out with the family.  If they are not successful in house-hunting, they are going to move to Floriduh (the gulf side) and buy there since it's cheap.  Randy calls that the Red-Neck Riviera.  Hahaha!  How funny, I guess it's beautiful there...white sand, turquoise water, and toothless people with mullets.  I guess you have to take the good with the bad in every situation.     Drew Ballinger: damn, you play a mean banjo.  Mountain Man: I'm gonna make you squeal like a pig. Weeeeeeee.  Mountain Man: What do you want to do now?  Toothless Man: [Grinning] He's got a real pretty mouth on him, don't he?

      I started a new med yesterday, and my tum tum hurts!  I'm so sick of feeling like crap, I wish these damn doctors would hurry up and find out what's wrong with me!  Either that...or put me on a permanent morphine IV drip.  I'm working on two huge projects at work, and luckily have the convenience and technology to do so from home when needed.  At least I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything by not getting in the car and driving to work being that "June Gloom" is lurking over Orange County.  It's these kind of days that make me miss Tucson.  Speaking of which, we will be traveling that way come end of July to visit my dad and his new fiance'.  I'm hoping we will encounter a huge monsoon storm while there!

      We are so blessed!  Okay, first of all my mom says we can buy all of their stuff from them before they move to Pennsylvania.  Then a week ago mom calls me and says she's changed her mind.  So Randy and I are back to square one on our hunt for furniture.  We drive down Tustin Ave and see this chest of drawers and nightstand in the same color wood (suntan) as my armoire!  So we pull into the discount furniture store and put down our deposit and promised to come back during the week to pick it up with a truck.  Well needless to say, we never had a chance to get down there, so we were planning on doing it this weekend.  Saturday we rec'd a phone call from Randy's mom stating that she was driving up from San Diego with a small dining room set she'd bought for us, and that she'd take us to get our other furniture afterwards.  Then on Sunday, RobnKaren call and offer up their sofabed, which is in awesome condition with toss pillows and all!  So now we have a place to sit-n-sleep ("you're killing me Larry!), store our underwear, and dine at the table!  Woo Hoo!!!!  Life doesn't get better than this!  Our friends and family are AWESOME!  I'm working from home today because I'm in major pain.  For some reason I can get a lot more done at home than when I'm sitting in the office.  Randy put in his notice today and starts his new job next Monday.  I am so happy for him, he has a wonderful new opportunity that he could not refuse.  Well, gotta go beat up some felines ( the cats think this new sofa is a scratching post )!  Let the ass kicking begin!!!

      Hello out there.  I am one happy camper today!  The bee-atch that I used to report to, and had to sit next to for the last 2 1/2 years, HAS LEFT THE COMPANY!  Yes folks, you heard right, she QUIT!  I will be doing the happy dance for the rest of the day, and well into my weekend now.    Let's see here...I have a lot to catch you up on.  I have been super busy, and still in the process of getting the house in order (boxes unpacked, new furniture, etc...).  I will not be getting the furniture mom promised (I won't go into details on that "don't even get me started"), so it's back to garage sailing and minor purchases here and there from discount furniture stores *sigh*.  I finally nailed down a date for my medical procedures to take place (August 16th).  That will be our one year anniversary (and the day that Elvis died in 1977 for those of you who care).    We had a nice Memorial Day weekend.  We hung out with some friends in Chino Hills (the Anahiem Hills of the '909'), and went bi-planing in San Diego.  The weather was awesome.  I can't wait for Summer!

      I adopted two baby mice from Tammy's daughter.  Her (original) two mice named Rose and Crystal had a litter (did she not see that one had something that the other did not...can you say "BALLSACK"??).  They are the cutest little things.  We bought them a fun little ball that they can roll around the house in, it's pure entertainment for the cats, specially Malibu.

       Congratulations, Sheila! Your IQ score is 126   This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others.   Your Intellectual Type is Insightful Linguist. This means you are highly intelligent and have the natural fluency of a writer and the visual and spatial strengths of an artist. Those skills contribute to your creative and expressive mind.   Yeah well...too bad I didn't "utilize" these skills earlier on.  The things I am able to draw look like something out of a five year old kid's imagination.  I took this IQ test on tickle dot com.

      Our company is goin DOWN fast!  I don't know what's going to happen to Wet Seal but it doesn't look good.  Analysts are predicting 50% chance of bankruptcy within a year.  Oh well, I will stick it out until something better comes along...or if the company miraculously turns around.  At least it's a resume builder for me at the present time.  I am learning a lot and I do enjoy working with the people here (especially now that the lady I reported to is GONE!   Yes...I am still doing the happy dance!  Randy has been so busy at his new job, but he loves it.  He worked from 7:30am - 9:00pm on Wednesday!   This weekend will be another crazy one.  Going to dinner with Michelle and Tammy tonight, picking up my new prescription glasses and sunglasses tomorrow.  Heading over to mom's to pick up our new dining room table and island for the kitchen, then hitting up the Harvest crusade at Angels Stadium at 7pm.  Sunday we are taking my mom and Brian to dinner to celebrate their new home purchase.  They bought an awesome custom home (built in 2002) in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.  Now we have more places to stay when we head out to the East coast.  I am still dealing with my pain issue.  The damn doctor I was supposed to see on Monday the 12th cancelled on me YET AGAIN!  I was so pissed off.  I called my PCP and asked that he refer me to another specialist.  Now my next appt is on July 22nd.  If this clown cancels on me I'm gonna go postal on him!  haha.  (just kidding of course)  I need to call Dee Dee, her little man "Brock" has arrived (born a few weeks ago) and I can't wait to meet him.  So much going on all the time, I wish I could just get all of my friends and family together in one place and have a big ole party!

       The Lori Hacking murder makes me sick to my stomach!  How could someone do that to their pregnant wife?  I just don't understand people.  I cried when I heard that he stabbed her while she slept.    urlLink this asshole did it!
