      I went to the Veloway for the first time to bike yesterday. It's a pretty cool place. It's 3 miles of paved trail (circular) with some nice hills and sharp turns (that I nearly bit it on quite a few times)  I did 15 quick miles (45 minutes to an hour of hard riding).   Last night's food: spinach  carrots tomotoes  So, today marks my one week anniversary of choosing to eat mostly raw foods.  I'm not 100% raw yet, and I hope to be within the next few coming months. I refuse to let myself give up or wimp out. This is a life style change for me. I do anticipate my making mistakes from time to time, but I'm not going to allow those to become excuses to continue making bad choices. I put my scale away so I'd stop standing on it every morning (and night), but now I'm just looking in the mirror instead. I think I like the results from the mirror better than I'd like what the scale might have to say. For one week, I'm pretty impressed.  I'm looking forward to my one month raw!

         Last night I was thinking that I would spend some time today to find out if wasabi is considered a raw food. I have no idea how it's prepared, but I wouldn't mind adding it to my diet to spice things up a bit. :o) I've noticed a few small things about my over all behavior that changed since last week. I'm no longer in a hurry to do nothing. Meaning that when I go home, I don't feel the need to "veg out" , and instead try to spend my time either riding my bike, cleaning months of disorder or strengthening relationships. I spent some time cleaning up and rearranging the furniture in my room last night. I think that once it's finished I'll be rather pleased.  I took the long way to the grocery store last night to pick up some more food. Menu: (last night) celery (2 stalks) peach (one rather squished from being stuffed in my backpack) milk from a young coconut   Breakfast: 3 cherry tomatoes,  1 stalk of celery,  5 snap beans 7 baby carrots and of course my green tea.

      I just went to the company fridge (to get my veggies) and saw a pie in there and thought "oh, gross". :o) I rock.

      I know it might be a little premature to say this... But the raw food diet/vegan diet really isn't so bad. The cravings I have are minimal and only last a minute at most. I just think to myself "I don't really want to do that to my body", and it's gone.  For breakfast today I ate peeled baby carrots and onions (yum) with my green tea. Lunch today is a beautiful salad with:  mixed spring greens red and green peppers purple cabbage cucumber a couple cherry tomatoes shredded carrot sliced mushroom purple onion  Dressing: sesame seed oil & raspberry vinegar

      Friday night I went to West Lynn Cafe (http://westlynn.citysearch.com) and ate a few bites of their vegetarian Chile Melt which was quite yummy, and is quite possibly going to make me miss eating cheese. Saturday Morning I woke up feeling quite good even after a night of drinking. I presume this was because I had the foresight to drink a couple glasses of water between alcoholic beverages. Saturday morning(-ish) I ventured to Kerbey Lane Cafe and had their Berkeley salad without cheese and Ginger Soy dressing.  mmmm I did have some tofu and vegetable stir-fry that I had delivered on later Saturday afternoon when I was too lazy to actually bike to the grocery store and pick up some produce.  Sunday morning I woke up rather early @ 6:30am, and went for a long bike ride of about 18-20 miles after having a banana for breakfast. I then went home and took a nap and then made my trip to the grocery store and got as much produce as I could pack into my backpack.  Breakfast today: Snow Peas Sprouts (I have to eat them before they go bad, you know?)  Today's Lunch includes: 3/4 med. tomato 1 green onion 1 ear of corn (yes, raw) a couple handfuls of some rather sad looking broccoli.  I imagine I'll be discarding most of it.

      Yesterday (5.20) I started eating mostly raw fruits and vegetables.  Menu for the last two days: Strawberries  Snow Peas Broccoli Sprouts (radish & clover) Avocado (today only)  None of this is eaten cooked, and although it ideally would be organic- it isn't.  For a little bit of back history on why I choose to torture myself this way ;-) I've been quite active the last three weeks running anywhere from 4-8 miles a day, and cycling hard for an hour or so on occasion... And it came to my attention that though I was looking a bit different, I wasn't necessarily seeing the results as quickly as I'd like. Now, I do realize that there are a number of drawbacks to whatever it is here that I'm doing. Firstly, a noticeable decrease in my available energy. I basically snack all day, eating when I'm hungry (which is about every two hours, and it takes me a good half hour or so to nibble a handful of broccoli, a 1/2 cup of sprouts, 3 snow peas, etc). The reduction in energy I'm assuming is largely due to the lack of complex carbohydrates that I typically ingest on a daily basis. Fair enough. Now, what I keep forgetting about is that when you drastically change your diet to include easily raw and/or organic foods (read: non-toxic) foods the body will start eliminating said toxins from the body thus imparting upon yourself bouts of horrid yuckiness. By stating this I'm merely trying to imply that I don't feel so good.

      It's been nearly a month since I've eaten primarily raw unprocessed foods.  I've had one cooked meal in this time so far, but I'm planning another for today.  I don't see anything wrong with 2 cooked meals in a month. I'm allowing myself this "pleasure" because i'm going to be doing a 2 week juice fast starting on the 20th/21st as a celebration of my one-month raw. sadistic, isn't it?

      I'm really happy about my choice to go raw that I made and have stuck to for the last two weeks, and I don't think I have any choice now. There's no turning back under penalty of death (I might be exaggerating). This morning I shucked and consumed an ear of corn. Incidentally my ears started burning... then arms starting itching. I pulled up my sleeves to investigate and noticed that they were turning bright red. This is about the time that the burning sensation consumed my entire body, and I was pretty much red everywhere I checked and found a few welts on my belly. joy. hives. Funny thing is, the same thing happened yesterday when I had corn, only it wasn't as bad. It's never happened before then. I've often had raw corn even before being raw. So, I spent some time researching food allergies and found the following:  "Spaghetti sauces, baked beans, canned soups, and most things found in a normal pantry, contain some corn-derived product. Read the labels. You will be amazed that even peanut butter, processed meats, imitation seafood, and imitation cheeses can contain corn derivatives.  Those who are allergic to corn need to avoid eating products that contain whole corn, corn flour, cornstarch, corn alcohol, corn gluten, corn sweetener, corn sugar, corn syrup, corn meal, corn oil, or popcorn. With this in mind, also watch out for the terms dextrose (also known as glucose or corn sugar), dextrin, dextrates, maltodextrin, caramel, or malt syrup on ingredient labels because they may also be sources of corn. Dextrose is used in cookies, ice cream and sports drinks. It is also found in crispy foods such as french fries, fish sticks, and potato puffs. Dextrin and maltodextrin, often made from corn starch, are used in sauces, dressings, and ice cream as thickening agents. Commercial food producers often make caramel flavoring with corn syrup instead of cane or beet sugar. Corn is used in maple, nut, and root beer flavorings for ice cream, ices, candy, and baked goods. Many soft drinks and fruit drinks contain corn syrup in the flavoring. Grits, hominy, maize, and marshmallows are also sources of corn. Corn starch is added to most confectioner's sugar and baking powders to keep them from caking or clumping. Corn may or may not be in food starch, modified food starch, vegetable gum, or vegetable starch. The manufacturer should be contacted if these terms appear on an ingredients label to see if corn is a factor. Also distilled white vinegar, bleached white flour, and iodized table salt may contain corn."   I think that about covers everything, no? I don't think I'll risk experimenting. :o) I'll stay raw, thanks.
