      There is only one more day until I can see Danny again... I am realy happy about that I cant wait. Then today we are picking up Caity sometime so I am excited about that. Yesturday I visited Brandie, Aj, and John. I was bord so skate boarded around. I need to finish cleaning my room today so Caity can sleep in my room lol. I dont realy have much else to do that I know of. I should go out and tan or something. Cause my legs are sooo white... but I guess they will get tan at the beach. We are leaving for the beach on Friday. I kinda wish that I was gonna b here Friday night cause Danny is going to the movies and Bobbie and Aj are going too. Well I dont know what else to say so ill start to get ready its not even 9 yet.. oh yeah and if u noticed that clock thingy is wrong like off by a few hours its realy like 8:45...

      Here's some poems that I have wrote when I was going through my heart break with Aj and ones that I have wrote lately...   So Alone  I never felt this way around you its like I am alone but u are there I liked when u looked in my eyes but now you look elsewhere  I loved the old times we had the time u use to spend with me you say you don't have time but I'm not blind I can see your feelings for me have changed but I still like you the same I wish we would be like before remmber when I seen u and u was glad I came r them times gone forever or will we be together again some day I wish you could show me u care and love that's what I always hope and pray but everyday I feel more by myself more and more scared and empty like the only book on a shelf time came and we r different now well maybe not me but I know u r remmber when I first went to your house and when your mom was gone u kissed me in the car now when we are together I feel like no one cares its weird I thought u was everything but now I just look away and stare I think about this way to much I always go to you and blame when I should just go away  but being alone makes me go insane   now that I am alone and drifting away I want someone to save me but I don't know the right way  I just need away from the pain and confusion I want to be loved again this is all I ask for why cant I have that its not like a sin   Save you  I feel like what I wish for wont ever come true all I want is to be loved by you I dream of us being together again someday but I don't really know what to say I can never get over the fun times we had the times when we was good and the times we was bad you are just so confused and lost you don't think about how it will cost I thought u was the one that was supost to save me but me trying to save u is how it came to be but u don't want to be saved and it hurts me to know my beliefs and my true love is what I wanted to show  I don't know if you even took any of what I said I wish my words would stick in your head I thought you was the one that I was supost to get maybe it was just a lesson I don't want to omit I will never give up I already promised myself I couldn't but I know that falling in love wont help and I shouldn't I want you to open your eyes and see what I view I just wish I could save you...   Something good  I know I got something good and its right there for me to take Not quite sure if this will be another mistake Why do I do this to myself, I shouldn't get upset don't do something you know you are going to regreat I am looking for something I already have, just don't want to find I don't understand myself, I'm so confused in my mind Then my dreams start to come true But I don't really know what to do Its like what I wanted I am not sure about now I want to fix this but I just don't know how My days are getting shorter but my nights are long But this confustion helps me write a good song I should look for the best in something that's not I will just live, let time go, and give it a shot    The Right  Did you ever know u was going wrong but didn't do the right Then things happened and you didn't want to be in sight Everything you did is now miserable and you dread You want to go back and change what you did and said But its too late now that time is long gone and past You wonder how long this pain and crap will last The only way you get away is in your prayer and dreams Hate and being all alone is what it seems  don't give up, never do that to yourself  Look in your mind don't lessen to your mouth   Hang On  somewhere in this world there's something good to find just keep looking don't let problems make u blind if u fall get up don't laydown don't even take a rest lessen when someone comes alone and pokes u in the chest don't give up have some faith, look past the worse I know how it feels like your under a curse but good will come if u look for it don't let it get worse as u sit hang on to your life don't let it go your problems wont grow look for that something in your life that makes u feel right just have faith and hold on tight

      I was doing something all day yesterday... I got up for church and Aj went with me, cause he wanted to see his new gf Bobbie. She is really nice... Anyways then after church I called Brandon and drove to his house on the 4-wheeler and we drove all the way to see Danny but he wasn't even home he was at his brother Ronnies, and we had to ride the rail rode tracks and it was so hard on the butt... Anyways then I took him back to his house and saw John he got his hair cut, and said he went to a play with Jess his new gf.. Then I went home and then over to Ronnies to see Danny... We just watched TV and sat around and the usual. We kidded around with the kids and they keep bugging us when we kissed and keep counting 1 fish, 2 fish, 3 fish, 4 fish LOL when we started kissing until we laughed and had to stop then when we went up stairs we started making out and it was wow... LOL anyways then Danny found my most ticklish spot and started tickling me and I tickled him and stuck my tongue in his ear it was funny we ended up all wreaseling in the yard. We was putting ice in eachothers pants and shirts it was cold... but funny. He tried to teach me how to do some stuff on a bike but I couldn't really do anything I was laughing so hard. Anyways I had a great day and am glad I got to see Danny... I really think this is relationship will last, atleast I hope so... Cause I love everything about Danny he's great... Anyways I just feel so lucky to be with him and want days like this to last forever...

      Yes for once I wasnt awaken by the annoying sound of banging on the wall of my room.... yay I got up early and Im not sure why I did but anyways... I still need to take a shower cause I probably stink hehe. yesturday we had our neighbors over and ashleigh for pizza and to play some games...... we played pictionary and some survival game... I lost both but it was fun. I also got to know Andy and uhhh his sister better I forget her name. Anyways thats two Andys that I met this year lol. Hes pretty cool when we went to his house to invite him and his sis over he showed me his pictures that he took scuba diving they were awesome. I wanted to scuba dive a while ago and though it would be neat to learn how he already took lesons and likes it alot. He was saying how I could take lessons but I doubt I woudl be able to do it cause I dont think its very cheap plus you have to buy half the gear which isnt that cheep. oh and I was wrong bout posting a message you gotta press the thing that says 0 comments then it will leave u write me something so please please please someone write me something I know you read this KAT the other day so u should know now how to leave me a message!!!!! arrrrrggggggg lol hehe sorry I just hate that I put a comments thing and no one uses it!

The other day I meet one of Dels students named Andy hes pretty cool, I went shooting with him and Asheigh... Then we found this awesome swim hole and me and Andy was the only ones that would swim in it, it was fun... they had like cliff type things you could jump off of and it was realy pretty my mom took some pics so I might be able to post them on here when she gets them devolped. Anyways I was wearing jeans and a shirt... I hope I didnt ruin my jeans cause they are new. Other then that I havnt been doing too much... I went shopping yesturday and my mom bought me some stuff for my birthday, a pink skirt... and pink shirt to match even some new shoes.... oh yeah and I bought some new earings some black jem ones that I have in now... dice, hearts, blue octopuses, and one other one I forget it though and no Im not kidding about blue octopuses lol.&nbsp;My friend Ashleigh draws really good I love her drawings I wish I could draw like she does. The other day she showed me her drawing book and she has some realy nice work in it she drew two for me but she is not finished with it yet one is of Avril and one of me. I love them and think they look great the way they are but she insists that she needs to do more work on them. I have been drawing some pictures myself...

      I have been so confused... about everyhing.... I just realy hope that the choise I made will work out and that I dont mess up. This has realy been bothering me. I wrote a new poem  &nbsp;    Something I didnt want   When I meet you I didn't think it would happen, Its not something I would do  But then I did let it happen and the cause of it was you  I cant blame you that all the mistakes I made stuck to me like glue  Its my fault that I took that chance because I really knew  I just dont know what I was thinking when all the bad started to come true  You would think I would change my mind but I never followed through  Its not just the lies you told me but all the rest too  I just want to get out of this and start all bran new  But will this change my life forever and just ruin it all  Or will I change my path and dont let myself fall  Why does it seem so hard it never was before  Not only did you lead me wrong but then my heart tore  I just need to turn my life around but how do I do that the way I am  My friends probably dont care, and my parents dont think I can  I just dont know what to do sometimes, what I care about most I dont wanna lose  I think what hurts me the most is the fact I have to choose  You made me something I didnt want but I was too blind to see  That everything that would happen, would just fall back on me&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I had to sing and dance it was funny. Anyways I have never been around sooo many lil kids the eight kids in my group was just a tiny portion of how many kids was there, they had many more groups it was packed. I just hope that they learn something from this and hope they have fun. I am helping all this week its from likw 6 till 9. I think Ashleigh is comming over tomorrow to set off fire works and maybe spend the night. I didnt do too much today other then Bible School.

      Ok I am in Arkansas now... I got here at 4 I am so tierd... I didnt hardly get any sleep last night, Dannys was there I ended up giving him 2 suckerbites I didnt mean too and we was so scared about my dad finding out I tryed to cover it up with make up but my dad saw anyways and didnt care... It was funny hes like thats something I would do. He dont care at all about me dating Danny cause he likes Dan. In the car we feel alseep and he had his arms around me... It was cute. I kissed him in front of my dad cause I feel more comfortable about that now. I realy hope this relationship lasts, I realy do care about him alot, I love him so much. I wish he was here with me now... just being with him last night and talking and being close to him was so special to me, I hope he feels the same. I am gonna miss him so much! I wish I could have spent more time with him this summer. Anyways hes all I can think about most of the time. My friend Ashley came over and she got me some gifts, it was realy nice of her, and we got to talk but I was kinda out of it cause I was tierd lol. Oh yeah btw I am rated an 8 on the weird factor of 1-10 acording to Danny haha. Anyways just wanted to drop a line... No one comments on this so people if u wanna leave a message u can click the thingy under this and type me a message I would apprecitate it...

I bought some cool stuff and something that I have been looking for but they have to send it in to me so it might take a while... I'll tell ya bout that later. But the beach was awsome I dont think I seen so many hot guys with out shirts on lol. I got a lil bit of a tan I am not sooo white anymore... but I did burn my back. I am so glad Caity could visit this summer we cought up on alot of things, and got to talk alot and just hang out like old times. She got to meet my friends we kinda hanged out yesturday my friends are a lot more mellow then hers lol. We entertain our selves in weird ways. I was glad to see Danny again I realy dont know how I will deal with not seeing him for six weeks when I visit my mom, I wish he could just come along. My dad said next year that he could come to the beach with us that would be cool. Caity is going home tomorrow, I am gonna miss seeing her. I hope next year I can visit her or something. On Friday I am leaving.. to see my MOM I cant wait to see her again... well I will try to put some pics up or something...
