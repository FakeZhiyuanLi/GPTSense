       she said i don't know if i've ever been good enough   i'm a little bit rusty and i think my head is caving in   and i don't know if i've ever been really loved   by a hand that's touched me   and i feel like something's gonna giva and i'm a little bit angry   well, this ain't over   no not here, not while i still need you around   you don't know me, we're not changing   but yeah, we just might feel good  - "push", matchbox twenty  this song has been playing in my head for the last few days. why? probably because i've been listening to the first matchbox 20 album before i go to sleep for the last week or so ... good album.  the frenchie (my exchange partner) goes home on sunday ... it'll be sad to see her go, but a relief to finally have enough time in the bathroom to do my hair in the mornings.  speaking of my hair, i'm considering cutting myself a fringe. i'm bored with my hair at the moment, and i want to change it, but not too drastic, and dyeing it is out of the question, because i've only just got it back to it's natural colour, and i want to keep it that way for a bit.  last time i cut my hair was a disaster ... hmm, hopefully i've improved!!!

       Well, I've decided to start a blog. Why? Because I'm bored ... and I really should be doing homework - this is going to leave a LOT of work for me to do tomorrow night ... oh well! That's tomorrow, and Rove's not on tomorrow!   Anyway, hopefully you'll get daily posts from me, about nothing in particular ...  Anyway, since I've got nothing really interesting to say, I'll go now, and come back tomorrow night - hopefully with something good to report.  See ya!!!

      Actually, Joe le Taxi has nothing to do with this post. I'm in Texts and Traditions at the moment, and I just got my John the Baptist assignment back: A+!!! And all the comment said was "Great work Brittany. Nice + detailed. Well done." So there you go. Thanks Mrs Mason!!!  Oh yeah - I handed in my persuasive essay.

      I email Knapman/Wyld productions regularly about getting WCB released on DVD ... please email them for me - just say you're a huge fan of WCB and that you really want them to release a best-of DVD or something. I think the only people who email them are me & Cathy ... and that's kind pathetic.   urlLink CLICK HERE  to email Knapman/Wyld.  For more info on Knapman/Wyld Productions (shameless plug, I know),  urlLink CLICK HERE  to visit their official website.  And if you want to join the WCB Yahoo group - we're a great lot of people ... then you may as well  urlLink CLICK HERE !!!  Yeah ... well the last email I sent to Knapmay/Wyld, which I admit was quite a while ago, generated this response:  Dear Brittany.   We have sought DVD production interest and as yet no-one has been interested.  We have done a limited 'inhouse' run of the best episodes but these are not available for commercial release at this time. So I am afraid we can't help you, although I will make enquiries regarding the cost of a limited edition although this would prove quite expensive.   Best regards,   Steve Knapman     So please join our campaign!!! I would do ANYTHING to see that first ever episode ...

      Looking at my profile picture, It's pretty obvious that I'm a fan of the Shebang ... so obviously I would have emailed them a few times. Here are some of their responses.  When Fifi was dumped by the landscaper (that horrible loser), I emailed her an extremely encouraging email ...  Dear Fifi,   I was absolutely appalled to hear what the landscaper did to you. What kind of lowlife dumps someone by text message? I just want you to know that you have the support of all your listeners, and I doubt any of us will accept invitations out from landscapers any time   soon! Don't worry, you'll find a better man in no time! From Brittany P.S. Marty better stay off your back for a bit, seeing as you are obviously emotionally distraught and unable to put up with any of his crap. I wonder if he could go a day of not being a complete and utter idiot...  To my amazement, they actually read my email out on air the next day, and Marty said he was very hurt. I also received this reply in my inbox:  Hey Brittany, Thanks so much for emailing Fifi.  We're printing off all the lovely letters of support and binding it up for her to remind her that we all love her and she doesn't need the landscaper. Cheers, The Shebang.     I also emailed them about Fifi's CD compilations, and received this reply:  Hey Brittany, Unfortunately Fi's done this on the sly, and hasn't got permission from the record companies or the bands, so she'd get into massive trouble if she made more copies and give them out.   So sorry about that, but in the next coupleof days we'll post the tracklisting on our website, so if you are able to make your own, that'd be cool. Cheers, The Shebang.     Yeah, so maybe it means nothing to anyone other than myself ... but still, they aren't the only replies I've received ... I'm just wondering if I should join the cloudstreet war ...

       So no one told you life was gonna be this way    Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.   It's like you're always stuck in second gear    When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but       {Chorus}   I'll be there for you   When the rain starts to pour   I'll be there for you    Like I've been there before    I'll be there for you    'Cause you're there for me too       You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight    You've burned your breakfast so far, things are going great    Your mama warned you there'd be days like these    But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees, and      {Chorus}       No one could ever know me   No one could ever see me    Since you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me    Someone to face the day with    Make it through all the best with    Someone who always laughs at    Even when I'm at my worst, I'm best with you   Yeah!      {Chorus}      I'll be there for you   I'll be there for you   I'll be there for you   'Cause you're there for me too     You may recognise the above as the theme song from the show "Friends". I told Eleanor that I'd mention her in my blog today, so I will: Eleanor is my friend. It's kind of a strange thing to write, but sometimes I don't know if people are really my friends or not ... but I know Eleanor is.  Aziz is back from Egypt you see, and she's doing her best to make me feel like a little lump of shit. I don't know if I'll be able to even really talk to Ella over the next few weeks. I mean, I understand right - they're friends, and Rebecca's just got back ... but I'm here too, remember? Rebecca doesn't like me, simple as that. It was all fine this year - I was even sort of getting along with her, but then she went all stupid (and she said horrible things about Fazz - she couldn't believe I liked him), and she said she was never speaking to me again. I didn't really care - it's not like we ever were friends in the first place ... but still - she just has to be friends with Ella and Lizz and Del.  I bet she's going to manipulate their minds and turn them against me. I've hardly even spoken to Ella since camp, and it's because almost every time I've seen her, she's speaking to Aziz, or trying to find Aziz so that she can speak to her. Yeah - so maybe I'm completely over-reacting and I'm a little jealous ... but I have good reason not to be in a good mood.  I'm not allowed to do 7 subjects next year. Mrs Gibbons said it would be good to do the extra maths (and she taught it this year - and I really need her as my maths teacher or I'll fail). But then Mrs Jolly said there was no way that the school would let me do 7 subjects. Yeah - I'm kinda DEVASTATED ... I really had my hopes up - I wanna be smart :(  Anyway, now I can't do general maths ... so I just have to pray that I get a decent teacher for methods.  Oh well, at least I'm doing 4 subjects the same as Adèle ... then there's more of a chance that we'll get into the same French class (PLEASE!!!!!!!).  I've got French next, actually. Yes - once again I'm wasting a web-authoring lesson typing a lovely blog entry. I might have to do my oral - stupid computer kept stuffing it all up. I'll be right ... it's a good one and I'm guaranteed an excellent mark (trust me, I know!).  Going to see farenheit 9/11 this afternoon, thanks to Mr K. (It's for People and Politics). I'm really not interested, but it comes out of our fees, whether we see it or not - so I may as well see it. Plus - we miss P.E!!! (Je deteste le sport).  The time is 18 minutes past 9. We still have 22 mins left of this class. 22 minutes of me typing random crap ... you're going to enjoy this !!!  Actually, I'm going to end this post here. I might start another one after I've posted this one ... but I don't know. We'll see ...

      I have no life ... spending my free time on SPARKLIFE. You may not remember, but many a year ago, I achieved my goal of scoring 100% on their bitch test. (On purpose of course ... I'm not really 100% bitch!!! I don't think ... ).  Anyway, today I (intentionally) got the amazing score of:  Greedy animal! You are certifiably: 98% Greedy! That's higher than the Worldwide Greed Average of 35%! Compared to 2,195,612 other test-takers... 100% less greedy than you — 0% like you — 0% greedier than you  (Okay, the pictures don't work - but you get the point!!!)  If you don't believe me, then go to  urlLink http://community.sparknotes.com/  and then add me ( urlLink britt_the_boss@hotmail.com ) to your friends list, and you'll see my score !!!

      I am an extremely boring person, and try as I might to make myself seem interesting - the truth is, I'm no different to everyone else, except that I'm possibly a little more evil. (Thanks to Ella for making me see myself as evil - I really appreciate it ... not!). Yeah - sorry bout the sarcasm. Aziz is back and she's being mean to me, and Ella's friends with her and has been talking to her which is perfectly understandable, but I'm really not in the mood to be understandable.  I gave Adèle my old diary (term 4, year 9) to read. I just felt like it. She will probably find it extremely amusing. I dunno. I'm just strange.  Anyway, just so that I think that my blog isn't completely boring, I'm going to post some jokes, courtesy of my friends at  urlLink www.funny.com  - just note: these will be jokes that I haven't read before, so they probably won't be any good because I've been on this site quite a bit, and the jokes are ranked in order of funniness. Oh well, here goes:     Playing the Game   Two bored dealers are waiting around for someone to walk up and try their luck at the craps table. A very attractive lady comes in and wants to bet twenty-thousand dollars on a single roll of the dice. The dealers agree. She says, "I hope you don't mind, but I feel much luckier when I'm half naked." With that she strips naked from the waist down, and rolls the dice while yelling, "Momma needs a new pair of pants!" She then begins jumping up and down and hugging each of the dealers. "YES! I WIN! I WIN!" With that she picks up her money and clothes and quickly leaves. The dealers just stare at each other dumbfounded. Finally one of them asks, "What did she roll anyway?" The other answers, "I don't know. I thought YOU were watching the dice!"     Missionary   A missionary who had spent years showing a tribe of natives how to farm and build things to be self-sufficient gets word that he is to return home. He realizes that the one thing he never taught the natives was how to speak English, so he takes the chief and starts walking in the forest. He points to a tree and says to the chief, "This is a tree." The chief looks at the tree and grunts, "Tree." The missionary is pleased with the response. They walk a little farther and the padre points to a rock and says, "This is a rock." Hearing this, the chief looks and grunts, "Rock." The padre is really getting enthusiastic about the results when he hears a rustling in the bushes. As he peeks over the top, he sees a couple in the midst of heavy romantic activity. The padre is really flustered and quickly responds, "Riding a bike." The chief looks at the couple briefly, pulls out his blow gun and kills them. The padre goes ballistic and yells at the chief that he has spent years teaching the tribe how to be civilized and kind to each other, so how could he just kill these people in cold blood that way? The chief replied, "My bike."  (These aren't very funny ...)     Talking Frog   A man was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and said, "If you kiss me I will turn into a beautiful princess." He bent over , picked up the frog, and put it in his pocket. The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will tell everyone how smart and brave you are and how you are my hero." The man took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it, and returned it to his pocket. The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will be your loving companion for an entire week." The man took the frog out, smiled at it and returned it to his pocket. The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for a year and do ANYTHING that you want." Again the man took the frog out, smiled at it, and put it back into his pocket. Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a beautiful princess, that I will stay with you for a year and do any thing that you want. Why won't you kiss me?" The man said, "Look, I'm a computer programmer. I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a TALKING FROG IS COOL."  Okay, that's enough now. I honestly cannot be bothered to copy/paste and edit these jokes (when they pase in here they go all haywire).  I might post more tonight. I mightn't though, because I have the VCE information evening, and it's very important that I go.  Here are the VCE subjects that I have chosen: Yr 11. English 1/2 Lit 1/2 Methods 1/2 General Maths (M) 1/2 French 1/2 Visual Communications 1/2 Psych 3/4  Yr 12. English 3/4 Lit 3/4 Methods 3/4 French 3/4 Visual Communications 3/4  I need to decide whether it's worth doing general maths in year 11 or not. I think it's a good idea, but I need to talk about it with a maths teacher (pref. Mrs Gibbons) and see what they recommend I do. I might even do specialist in year 12 - but that'd be really hard. I don't know if I could cope with 6 subjects in year 12. But I'm sure I'll be fine with 7 in yr 11 - it's not all that important. Year 12 is what really counts ...

      Returned from camp yesterday ... many things happened on camp. I honestly can't be bothered to structure this, so I'll just list things randomly:   Had a really deep conversation with Ingrid, Alice & Amy about religion and politics  Lizzie got really shitty with me and kept making snide comments  I was nice to Ms Roberts  We had a fire  Jessie's group were robbed, and they stole Jessie, Annie and Becky's tent and a lot of their stuff  On the way there I sat with Lizzie on the bus  On the way back I sat next to Priscilla (but opposite Steph and Anna) and left Lizzie to sit by herself  When we slept in cabins I was with Ingrid and Alice etc. but Lizzie chose to stay with Vicki  Ms Roberts said I didn't need to convince her that I'd be good on the Marcian committee  I had to share a tent with Lizzie  Sarah Wills threw up on the way back and made me feel sick. I felt really sorry for Mrs Barden and Ms Roberts who had to clean it up  I was officially the worst hiker in my group  I was one of th worst skiiers  I am aching all over due to falling over many times and carrying an extremely heavy pack for 4 or so kilometres at a time  We were snowed on  I ruined a pair of my shoes  My sunglasses broke  Everything of mine stank when I got back  When we were driven back to Jungai after camping out, there were good songs on the radio: Cat's in the Cradle, Break My Stride, Sex and Candy, Sing Halleluia, (some crap song), Big Yellow Taxi ... I think there was another, but I can't remember it. Me, Penny and Anna led the singing. Lizzie just sat staring out the window - pissed off  I didn't sleep much  I read my book when I should have been sleeping  Someone snored  My hair looked really bad  My face was really dirty when I got home  The majority of things I said were comments about how stupid I am  I sang lots of songs  When we were skiing, Lisa told us to  slide , so I had the Goo Goo Dolls song stuck in my head  Our camp leader was Lisa, and she was good - she was nice to me even though I was slow and unfit  I realised how unfit I am  I don't care about Lizzie anymore  Lizzie kept complaining about everything, especially our group:  "Steph hates me...", "Why were we stuck in this group?", "Everyone always excludes us"  etc.  Lizzie failed to realise that this was the only group I would have been happy in (except possibly Ella's, except I don't know about that one because of Annaliese). Imagine if I had been stuck with Liv and Vicki - I probably wouldn't have gone on camp  I had too much food  I fed lots of people including teachers  I missed Fazz, and I haven't heard from him in over a week  Our pancakes were a failure - but scrambled pancakes taste better anyway...   * ^ * ^ * ^ * ^ *  I read through my old diaries today. They're actually really interesting to read. The thing is, I now want to let someone else read them to see what they think. Like Ella or Lizz or Del or even Ingrid. I dunno why ... I guess I just hate hate having to keep something inside me. I've gotta call Ella tomorrow - ask her about camp and stuff. I can't believe I haven't seen or spoken to her since Monday !!! I have lots of things to share with her.  :: :: :: :: :: :: ::     My Skiing song:  Slide - Goo Goo Dolls      Could you whisper in my ear The things you wanna feel I'll give you anything To feel it comin' Do you wake up on your own And wonder where you are You live with all your faults   Chorus: I wanna wake up where you are I won't say anything at all So why don't you slide Yeah we're gonna let it, slide   Don't you love the life you killed The priest is on the phone Your father hit the wall Your ma disowned you Don't suppose I'll ever know What it means to be a man Something I can't change I'll live around it   Chorus   And I'll do anything you ever Dreamed to be complete Little pieces of the nothing that fall May put your arms around me What you feel is what you are And what you are is beautiful May do you wanna get married Or run away   And I'll do anything you ever Dreamed to be complete Little pieces of the nothing that fall May put your arms around me What you feel is what you are And what you are is beautiful May do you wanna get married Or run away    (Thanks to  urlLink http://www.lovelyrics.com/artists/GOO%20GOO%20DOLLS%20lyrics/GOO%20GOO%20DOLLS%20SLIDE%20lyrics.php  - from which I directly copied the above lyrics).

      Well, I had an idea today: when I'm on camp, I'm going to keep record of every time I burst into song for no reason, and see how many times it happens over a 4-day period ... I have a feeling I'll lose count.  But I think it'd be interesting to write down the names of the songs too, just to see the kind of things that just come to my head sometimes.  Camp will be extremely interesting - I can honestly predict that. I'm a little worried about the whole Ms Roberts thing ... but I'll finish the essay tomorrow night (I had to work today ... no time).  Tomorrow morning I've gotta drop by Safeway, and seeing as I'm going to wag VCE music, I was thinking what I'd do is leave at the end of people and politics, tram into Kew - go to Safeway there, and then tram back in time for recess. All I gotta do is forge a note of permission, and I've done that plenty of times.  I really shouldn't have written that down. That's evidence against me. But I've decided to ask Mum if I can leave school instead. That's right, I've now got Mum's permission and a note from her, so no-one has to worry at all. I'm perfectly innocent. I would never ever do something like that ... no way, that's just not me. So just forget what I wrote above, because all is well now.  I'm going to tape Mallrats tonight ... infortunately over the top of Small Claims - but I'm going to but that on DVD when it comes out anyway.

      I get a weekly newsletter called "this is true". It's really interesting to read some extremely strange (yet true) news stories:  WHO'S CALLING? Law enforcement officials need to learn to differentiate  between criminal hackers who cause damage to computer systems and  benign hackers just trying to learn how things work, says industry  pioneer Steve Wozniak. Addressing a conference of presumably the latter  type of hackers in New York, Wozniak described how he learned to hack  the long distance telephone network from another early hacker, John  "Captain Crunch" Draper, named for using a whistle packed in Cap'n  Crunch cereal in the early 1970s to control the phone network. As a  teenage prank, Wozniak, now 53, says he used the "phone phreaking"  techniques Draper taught him to call the pope.  WHO'S CALLING? II: After committing at least 262 burglaries in the U.K.  over just a year's time to support his heroin addiction, the criminal  career of John Cash, 32, should be over. Judge Barrington Black of  London's Harrow Crown Court handed down an unusual sentence: jail for  seven years, and then for five years after that he may not enter any  house -- anywhere in the country -- without permission. The order even  covers the phone: Cash is not allowed to "call at any residential  premises by way of doorbell, knocking or telephone call," the order  states.  PAGING COLONEL HOGAN: A prison in Port Augusta, S.A., Australia, opted to  turn off a faulty sensor on a fence rather than pay A$75,000 to replace  it, but officials were still surprised to learn inmates were taking  advantage of the security hole. Guards caught a prisoner after he  briefly escaped and went to a party in town to buy drugs, and then  returned. The man admitted that brief escapes were "quite common" among  the prisoners in the affected pod, which included a murderer. "I make  no excuses for it," said Correctional Services chief Peter Severin.  "But in an open security environment you manage in an environment of  trust."  FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED: Mexico's Attorney General Rafael Macedo says  that several staffers in his office, including himself, have been  implanted with a computer chip that allow them access to high-security  computer files in an effort to fight crime. Further, he says, the chip,  which is implanted in his arm, allows him to be tracked, which will  protect him from kidnapers. "I can be located at any moment wherever I  am," Macedo says, adding that the chip "is unremovable."

      Well, things have been rather interesting at the moment ...  I went to house drama last night. I was going to be hanging out with Adèle, Steph, Alice etc. after school, but that was brought up ages ago, and then I kind of felt like I wasn't really invited, so I just went home, and met them at school again at 7.  Then halfway through, after interval, Ingrid, Ella, Lizz, Steph and Alice went and sat upstaris, and me and Del were left sitting by ourselves!!! But it was really good, because the  Taylor was on and it was the best, easily!!! Anna was really good as Bill, who was retarded, and she picked up the best actress award. Phil got best supporting actress - she was an old woman called Molly, and it was one of those old woman characters that I really adore. I really loved that play, it was so amazing and I felt a connection with it the whole way through. Del cried ... I just sat there, emotionless - it hit me sooo hard!!! We won, naturally ... and when Anna got her award, me and Del stood up and cheered so hard, because we were ecstatic. (And then when it finished, we checked the time, found out it was 11:45, and I got in a shitload of trouble ... but it wasn't my fault it went overtime!!!).  I invited Fazz to come, but when I smsd him yesterday morning, he never replied, and he never turned up. So I don't know what's up ... hopefully nothing big ... I tried calling him, but the phone was off. So, I'm not exactly going to sit here waiting for him to come on MSN - I think it's his turn to make an effort to contact me ... perhaps say sorry .... and then it'll all be better.   ~  * ^ *  ~  * ^ *  ~  * ^ *  ~

      I can't write much today - I have to work on a couple of overdue English essays.  I'm proud to say, I handed in my texts and traditions assignment on time today. I don't think it was very good - I had to leave a lot of stuff out, because John the Baptist was an extremely prominent figure before and during Jesus' time. Hopefully Mrs Mason will be kind, and give me an A+ for it anyway - it was longer than most people's, and it was written well too.  After English today, Ms Roberts asked me what "the story" was - about my avoiding submitting a pair of essays this term. I told her there wasn't a story - to be honest I had no excuse apart from disorganisation ... she was a bit angry - but I made an effort to make conversation with her, and she was nice back - really *cute* actually. (Ms Roberts, if you are reading this, I suggest you ignore this last paragraph).  Listening to the Shebang at the moment - time for "ponder this" ... does the invisible man get sunburnt? Fifi says no ... Marty asks again, "does the invisible man get sunburnt?" ... Fifi says yes. If all the world is a stage, where does the audience sit? Fifi: The audience is God, and he sits on the moon. Marty asks again ... Fifi says, "in the ocean" - well pondered.  Okay, you're probably wondering why my title is about the pope ... well, Pope John Paul says that feminism is destroying the concept of a family. And that homosexuality is evil ... bloody Catholics. People wonder why I hate the Catholic religion so much - this is why!!! They say stupid things like that. (No offense intended on any Catholic person, except the Pope. I know and adore many Catholics, including my 3 sisters and 2 of my friends, so I'm not bagging you, just your religion).  Anyway, I really shuld do some work (which I will begin as soon as Mother leaves the room - for obvious reasons). So, I'll write more later.

      Well ... today was one of the worst days of my life. Lets review it step-by-step...  1st: Form assembly. Well, I've already written about how crap I felt then. So all I need to say is a big thankyou to Ella and Anna for being nice, and looking out for me.  2nd: Web Authoring. I was lonely. I'm always lonely these days. I don't know if it was even worth choosing that subject - but I wouldn't be any better off in Nationalism: firstly because I wouldn't enjoy it, and secondly because Ella and Adèle and Ingrid etc. are better friends with each other than they are with me ... and then there's the whole thing about Rebecca, who hasn't spoken to me in ages.  3rd: French. I love French. It's one of my favourite subjects (I know - it's pretty pathetic). But today in French we were presenting our orals, and my CD wouldn't work. I put  so  much effort into it, and I was actually looking forward to presenting it. Off to a bad start already.  4th: Recess. Nothing bad really happened at recess, but nothing good happened either. Actually, one bad thing happened: I realised I had double English next. (No offense Ms Roberts).  5th: Double English. Firstly - she made me read a part in Romeo & Juliet, which was bad. And when I got to go to the library to find a book for wide reading and came back with 8 - I don't think she was extremely impressed. And then Julia, Emily, Bob & Pip were having reading competitions with me, and Julia asked Ms Roberts to d one, and she wasn't too impressed by the idea ... too scared that I would beat her, perhaps? (Or maybe she just wanted to express her hatred towards me by showing that she won't voluntarily participate in activities involving me ... but then  WHY  am I in her camp group? - This is what I find impossible to understand!!!).  6th: Maths. We got our probability tests back. Naturally I made 2 stupid mistakes, and I lost a mark on one thing I misunderstood - yet  4  marks were missing. What had I done wrong??? That was the question I asked Mrs Kettle. Well, apparantly I lost a mark because I filled out the table with percentages instead of decimals. Why was this wrong, I asked. Because there was a one in the corner, meaning they should all add up to one. But technically, don't percentages add up to one, too - 100% = 1 in percentages language. Plus - I was never taught that they had to be decimals, and it didn't say that they had to be decimals in the question! Well, I fought long and proud, but I couldn't convince her to give me my mark back. And then I worked out my grade: if she hadn't taken off the mark, then I would have got an A+ ... but I'm stuck with an A, because my teacher hates me. Then I left the classroom feeling extremely upset, and spoke to Ella, who said in her class (the top group, which is where I am meant to be, but technically I'm not smart enough for...) were given the mark even if they did percentages, because Mr Gowdy thought that was correct. That's discrimination!!! Just because I'm in the 2nd group, Mrs Kettle thinks she can treat me like dumb shit!!!  7th: Abba. Actually, Abba was okay. Just a shout out to Mrs Mason to say thanks for being so nice - she's such a great person - was very kind to me in my strange hysteria (the effects of a certain maths teacher on my brain. Happens often after maths tests). So, thank-you Mrs Mason, and sorry I'm such a crap student. My next texts assignment is due tomorrow, and I promise it will be in on time!!!  8th: People and Politics. Well, Mr K forgot to come - so the first 1/2 hour of the lesson was fine - I was talking to Emma and Zoe. But then when he turned up, finally, after Elise and Margeaux had to go fetch him, he decided to start a discussion on the free trade agreement - which doesn't actually concern us, because none of us are old enough to vote - and if we cared then we'd read about it in the newspaper. And the he told us about our first assignment - a research paper on a  HERO . Yeah, well, who is my hero??? Harriet Walker - well she's a fictional character, can't do her!!! Melinda, Chrissy or even Jo (from  Small Claims ) - all fictional!!! Then there's Freya, but she's an actress ... and people would probably make fun of me. But she is a great role model. I don't know!!!  9th: P.E. I had a *note* to excuse myself from participating, so I got to watch the class learn some footy skills. Football's too dangerous for me. I was almost killed about 3 times by stray balls, and all I was doing was sitting behind the table. Mr Oneill's so used to it now. He even said to me, "Are you too tired from avoiding playing soccer yesterday?" (yeah - I had almst perfect sports uniform yesterday - everything except I wore my school jumper).  10th: Fazz. Well - I turned up at the bus stop, just after 1/4 to 4 - the agreed time, and he wasn't there. So I sorta hung around, but I felt a bit weird seeing as I don't even catch the bus, until Vinnie told me Fazz wasn't even at school today. So I felt really shit ... I was looking forward to seeing him all day, it was raining, and I needed a hug.  11th: Gloria Jeans. There was a tram coming that was heading into Camberwell, so I decided to see if I could catch Ella, Lizz and Annaliese at Gloria Jeans, because I didn't feel like going home, and they left school just after me, so I knew I could catch them. They reached the tram stop at about the same time I did, coincidentally. So I joined them. I didn't think Ella and Lizz would mind. But Annaliese did. She really didn't seem happy with my desperate need for support, and my tagging along to avoid being alone.  12th: At the station. It wasn't so bad, until we got to the station and Ella left. I started crying, because she was gone, and Annaliese and Lizz were talking. I tried to include myself in the conversation, and Lizz helped, but Annaliese seemed unwilling. I don't know what I ever did to her - I like Annaliese, but she really doesn't seem to like me ... (sighs).  So anyway, there's not much I can do at the moment, except find my phone, and hope that by some miracle Fazz has messaged me. And I'm gonna call Ella - her counselling skills are required immediately.  Oh yeah - we didn't end up having the French vocab quiz (thankfully) !!!

      I feel like such a loser at the moment ... it's horrible. In form this morning, everyone was sitting around in a circle, and I tried to join in, but noone would talk to me or anything. I felt so bad ... so I ended up going outside and sitting outside my locker eating chocolate - which I really shouldn't have wasted my money on this morning.  I hope my mood improves before the end of the day - I'm seeing Fazz this afternoon, and I need to be happy ... which I am - I'm happy that I get to see him (it's been awhile), but I'm still miserable about my situation at school. It's kinda sad that the only classes I actually have *friends* in, are maths, French and elective music.  Speaking of French, I have a vocab test next !!! I haven't studied either, really. I don't think I'll do too badly - because I understand most of the words. The main ones I'm gonna have trouble with are  un film de guerre  (a war movie),  un film d’épouvante  (a scary movie),  décevant  (disappointing), and  interdit  (forbidden).  Wish me luck !!!

      At lunchtime today, Ella said that she thinks the Cindi Lauper song "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" describes her attitude to life.  After about a minute of thinking, I came up with one for me: "What's up?" by 4 Non Blondes.   25 years of my life and still   I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope   For a destination   I realized quickly when I knew I should   That the world was made up of this   Brotherhood of man   For whatever that means      So I cry somethimes when I'm lying in bed   To get it all out what's in my head   Then I start feeling a little peculiar   So I wake in the morning and I step   Outside I take deep breath   I get real high   Then I scream from the top of my lungs   What's goin' on      And I say hey...   And I say hey what's goin' on   And I say hey...   I said hey what's goin' on      And I try, oh my God do I try   I try all the time   In this institution   And I pray, oh my God do I pray   I pray every single day   For a revolution      So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in my bed   To get it all out what's in my head   Then I start feeling a little peculiar   So I wake in the morning and I step outside   I take a deep breath   then I get real high   Then I scream from the top of my lungs   What's goin' on      And I say hey...   And I say hey what's goin' on   And I say hey...   I said hey what's goin' on   And I say hey...   And I say hey what's goin' on   And I say hey...   I said hey what's goin' on      25 years of my life and still   I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope   For a destination      (Just ignore the fact that I'm not 25 ... but you kinda get the idea.)   [Thanks to  urlLink http://www.alwaysontherun.net/4non.htm#c  - where I copied the lyrics from. But I think they're a bit wrong. You can find the song and make your own judgements]

      I'm sitting here in my "web-authoring" class,  extremely  bored. I've finished all the modules, but I really should be listening to Mr Robinson's explanation of templates ... I'm pretty confident though.  Had a maths test today. I didn't study, but I'm feeling pretty confident. Lizz said that Mrs Kettle told her it was easier than the investigation, which I got A+ (and I think 100%) for. So I figured I'd be right.  I felt really confident during the test - I might have stumbled over one or 2 questions I'm not 100% sure about, but I got the same answer at the end as Vicki did, which is really good - because she's in the top maths group.  If I get 100% on this test, then I'll be really happy. I should get the results tomorrow, and don't worry - I'll post them!!!  And good news for me - Mr Hetchler has given us a little longer to complete French part A assignment because some of us find it hard to find French movies to watch. I'm so relieved, because it means I can watch Rove tonight (after I finish my English persuasive essay).  Ms Roberts wasn't here today. So I didn't get to mention anything about being in her camp group to her ... I wanted to say something, and just see what she said.  Mrs Mason wants to name her baby Ella if it's a girl. And it's due just before Miss Pope's birthday too. It'd be kind of cute to have 2 Ellas born on the same day. But Mrs Mason should know better than to name her child after a student. It's a pretty silly thing to do - your kid's going to remind you of a student - and what if you end up hating that student ... you never know what might happen. That's why I don't want to name my kids after anyone who I actually know (but celebrities and TV/book characters are okay).  I've got some names picked out already.  Girls:  Jacynta Harriet Mallory Prudence Freya (I haven't got her middle name worked out yet ... does anyone know Freya Stafford's middle name?)   Boys:  Zye Jackson Brody Asher   urlLink Click here to email Mrs Mason some baby name suggestions ... (she won't mind)

       Today we found out our groups for year 10 camp. We don't leave until next Tuesday, but one of our task is a day when we self-cater, so we needed to know our groups to organise what we're going to take.  I'm actually not surprised about my group at all. I was expecting to have Ms Roberts as my teacher, just because of the complications that's sure to cause ... The one thing I wasn't expecting though, was to not be in Ella, Lizz and Adèle's group. I was really looking forward to being in a group with them ... and as for a certain other request which I made to Mrs Barden, which she didn't honour - I guess some things you have to live with!  Anyway, this is my group: Steph Alice Ingrid Lizzie L Amy Anna F Elise P Penny Anna P Gen A Mel L (I think...)  Anyway, the self catering is organised in groups of four, so for that I'm with Ingrid, Lizzie and Alice. It's actually quite fun organising a menu plan. I'm in charge of breakfast (my least favourite meal of the day - yet they say it's the most important). So we're going to have pancakes!!!

      I keep getting annoying forwards in my inbox. Things that say, "Send this to 45667 people and the guy you like will propose within the next 2 hours!!!" ... but sometimes, on the odd occasion, there's one one that you actually find funny, and that's what happened to me today.  I opened my emails this afternoon, and discovered about 5 forwards of the same thing ... thinking it must be good, I opened one of them, and this is what I found:   Application to Date My Daughter   1.

      I don't think I've really got the hang of the whole blog thing quite yet ... but I'll get there.  Aiaiaiaia!!! I'm  so  busy today!!! I had a piano lesson this morning, and in an hour, I start work at Safeway. I'm there until 6:30, and then I'm babysitting for the rest of the evening. And tomorrow morning I have to be up early to drop my French exchange student to the airport, and say goodbye...  Listening to Mathbox Twenty - their first album. I still reckon their 3rd album ( More Than You Think You Are ) is the best, but this one ( Yourself Or Someone Like You ) definitely comes in at second.  So, here is a song ... I'll pick one at random:   It's sitting by the overcoat   The second shelf, the note she wrote   That I can't bring myself to throw away   And also   Reach she said for no one else but you,   Cuz you won't turn away   When someone else is gone   I'm sorry 'bout the attitude   I need to give when I'm with you   But no one else would take this shit from me   And I'm soTerrified of no one else but me   I'm here all the timeI won't go away   Yeah it's me, yeah I can't get myself to go away   Hey it's me and I can't get myself to go away   Oh God I shouldn't feel this way        Reach down your hand in your pocket   Pull out some hope for me   It's been a long day, always ain't that right   And no Lord your hand won't stop it   Just keep you trembling   It's been a long day, always ain't that right   Well I'm surprised that you'd believe   In anything that comes from me   I didn't hear from you or from someone else   And you're so   Set in life man, a pisser they're waiting   Too damn bad you get so far so fast   So what, so long      (Chorus)      Oh ain't that right?   It's me, yeah well I can't get myself to go away   Hey it's me, yeah well I can't get myself to go away   Oh God I shouldn't feel this way now      (Chorus)      Yeah reach down your hand in your pocket now   Reach down your hand right now It's been a long day, always   Ain't that right?   Reach down your hand in your pocket now   Reach down your hand right now   It's been a long day, always   Ain't that right?   Oh ain't that right?   Ain't that right right right on child?   Right right right on child right right on child   (Copied directly from  urlLink http://www.lyrics007.com/Matchbox%2020%20Lyrics/Long%20Day%20Lyrics.html , because I can't be bothered typing them up myself)  Anyway ... I'll be back tomorrow, with another insightful post!!! And I'll have a bit more time to think of what to write.  See ya!
