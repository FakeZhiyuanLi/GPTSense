       Congratulations Isabelle ! We are all really happy for you.  Yesterday Isabelle, Mukami, Els and I went to eat out at a Thai restaurant amidst my urges to go watch the Czech whipp the Greeks, well tough luck since i had to face the Greeky night all night due to the insatiable noise that was just incredible....Portugal had better get me my mood back. Im still deeply in Pain for France's Loss.  Well, it finally hit me i have just a couple of days remaining for my term to be over in AIESEC in Belgium, Diana and Paola arrived and melancholic waves are beginning to crowd my mind, not just missing the people that i have learnt to love but missing Brussels. Brussels is one of those cities that will go in my "Livre d'Or" Its a mixture of the whole world in one small place, the chaotic lifestyle, the modesty, the full of life city where you can never miss out on a free concert..... but what i will really miss is the Grand Place and the thinking moments, people and feelings it always allowed me. Only if i could carry you with me.  Love, Life and Grand Place Emily

       I think it has taken me a year to finally say to myself "I am creating my blog Now !" It took a while ..... but i finally overcame the procrastination, its a pity though because lots of fresh experiences have passed me by and now i can only probably share them vaguely or share what i see today or tomorrow, soon i will hopefully make the presentations more interesting with pics and stuff.....Well, I welcome you all to Providence and enjoy it, but most importantly...... share your thoughts ......Heart, Hands and Soul, Emily  Don't sacrifice your life to work and ideals. The most important things in life are human relations. I found that out too late.   --Katharinde Susannah Prichard Australian Author

        urlLink    Some good memories of Belgium - EU Enlargement Day on the 1st of May at Cinquantenaire, that must be the biggest flying flag i have seen, The spirit of intergration was in the air with the new 10 countries joining the EU. It was such a special feeling to be there on this day !! Above view me, Tasha and Olivier infront of one of the Directorate Generals of the EU Commission

       Thanks to Dan, Last week I got an invitation to attend the prestigious private event of the inaugration of Prince Phillip as the President of the Club of Rome Brussels Chapter, Talk about being in the right place at the wrong time, there was about 80 people, everyone seemed to have been one of those great achievers and it was alittle embarrasing having to present exactly who i was.... You should have seen the grin on my face when i met the Prince and chatted alittle about AIESEC to him, the beautiful thing about it was the fact that these guys are now tired of old blood and the presence of young blood at this ceremony was really encouraging for them !you can catch up with me later for the "detailed" side of the story but first let me share with you who these guys are and how wonderfully thought their ideas are.  For those of you who dont know, who are "The Club Of Rome ??  They are a global think tank and centre of innovation and initiative.  As a non-profit, non governmental organisation (NGO), they bring together scientists, economists, businessmen, international high civil servants, heads of state and former heads of state from all five continents who are convinced that the future of humankind is not determined once and for all and that each human being can contribute to the improvement of our societies. They aim to work as a global catalyst of change. They do this by taking a global, long term and interdisciplinary perspective aware of the increasing interdependence of nations and the globalisation of problems that pose predicaments beyond the capacity of individual countries. These guys are a bunch of high standing and achieving dons in their field. Brushing shoulders with these guys was one of those AHA ! experiences for me, the need to Master self, the need to use your talent, the need to act and not be acted upon, the need to recognise the power of "interdependence" and the need to understand what truly is self actualisation.  Later, i will share with you thoughts from some great guys i met there !

       "The universe is one great kindergarten for man. Everything that exists has brought with it its own peculiar lesson. The mountain teaches stability and grandeur; the ocean immensity and change. Forests, lakes, and rivers, clouds and winds, stars and flowers, stupendous glaciers and crystal snowflakes--every form of animate or inanimate existence, leaves its impress upon the soul of man."  --Orison Swett Marden

       Attitude. (some wise words stolen from a friend)  The instruction to be unhappy, as written by P. Watzlawik, is so amazingly simple, because it just states, that it is us deciding, how we want to live certain moments. I more than once received the feedback to be an eternally smiling idealist.   Don't be proud of not smiling. Be proud of your attitude, but don't judge others'.  'The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life.  Attitude to me is more important than facts.  It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than success, than what other people think or say or do.  It is more important than appearance, gift, or skill. It will make or break a company...a church...a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way.  We cannot change the inevitable.  The only thing we can do is play on the string we have, and that is our attitude.   I am convinced that life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90 percent how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our attitudes.'
