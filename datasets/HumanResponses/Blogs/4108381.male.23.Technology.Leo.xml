      The title isn't as catchy as "The Joy of Cooking," but it is a fairly accurate. I got my septum punched last night to a 0 gauge. It didn't hurt near as bad as you might think. For a few seconds I thought I was stupid, but now I really enjoy it. It doesn't hurt at all hardly. It feels like I have a rock for the end of my nose.  I keep getting worried that it is plainly visible. It's not but I'm paranoid. This type of thing would probably not go over well here at the office. I hate being a "grown-up."  Back to the salt mines.

      I like it when my family goes on vacation.  Sure I have to feed to pets, but the quiet is worth it.  I hung out with people til midnight last night, I'm starting to feel like I might actually be getting some friends.  I'm at this scary time in my life where all I want is positive human contact and I get none.  Not a fun time to be alive.  Thinking about Teri is the bain of my existence.  Fenix TX said "being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up" in their song Pheobe Cates.  I know fully understand what they mean.  I grew up so much after meeting Teri.  My whole outlook changed from self gratification to pleasing her and her alone, that really sucked.  It started at the very begining.  She had to have seen the signs of it in the first month.  She could have put a stop to it but instead she encouraged it.  Now she holds it against me for all it's worth.  I want to be irresponsible again.  I'm going to get some work done that in all honesty is pretty dumb.  I'm getting it done because I miss the pain and frustration of healing.  My emotional healing has stopped and I need to get going again.  A jump start never hurts, well this type might.  I just wish I could change my appearance but my job requires a vanilla style.  It sucks.  This is enough of a rant.  I'm running late for work but there are things I need off my chest so here they are. Sorry if I spelled Indiana style.

      I turned 23 on Friday.  It was good having all of my family out to support me.  They have been really great through all of this.  I just pray I don't let them down.  Everyday is a little mini triumph and mini tragedy.  I got the new Chuck Palahniuk book for my birthday.  I'm pumped to read it.  He makes me want to write.  I suppose that is a good thing.  After two years of being told that my wife is the true writer, I'm ready to see what I can do.  I think I'm going to start some new short fiction pieces that are floating around my head.  Maybe I'll be able to make sense of them in time.  I got nothing else to say.  I'm lame.

      I had dinner with my parents tonight.  I seem to be hanging out with them a lot.  I've lost a great number of friend along with losing my wife.  Having this hit me all during graduation really sucks.  I know that I won't ever see a lot of my friends every again.  Not seeing my wife again, that's hard to deal with too but she's created a lot of false animosity between us to make it ok.  I just wish she didn't go for the jugular of our relationship.  I could have justified her unhappiness, but she willingly ran into the arms of another man.  She thought that she would fall in love with one of the four guys she was hanging out with, Donnie just happened to be the one most readily available.  She's kind of a slut that way.  We even had precautionary sex before she went to see him.  I know it's a sick thing to tell your husband after the fact.  She's a sick person and I know that now.  I see clearly and I am more hurt but better because of it.

      Where I work at I have days called "Go Lives."  Basically that means that I go to a customers site and solve problem for their first day of business on our system.  It's actually fairly exciting but the problem is that with bars and late night places I work an 8 hour day then I work until 10 or later that night at the actual go live.  It leads to a very tiring day.  Today was one of those days.  The only difference between this and my other go lives is the amount of very attractive women at this location.  Two were border line hot but still way out of my league.  Heck I don't even know what sport they were playing.  Overall it was a positive, if not breathtaking, day.

      Big steps, big steps. I made it through yesterday with only a few rough patches and some talks with my mom about mental illness. Nothing much, but I think she wants me to start taking medicine to balance out my chemicals. I'd probably start taking them but I always forget to. I haven't breathed through my nose in months because allergy pills are so damn hard to remember.  I talked to  urlLink Jamie O  last night. She's a quirky, fun girl to be around, plus she's a pretty kickass writer. If I ever get my own talk show she is promised a job. We talked about Teri and how she might have issues she needs to work through and I know that Jamie is right. She commented on everything I commented on two months ago when Teri left. I should add Smart to Jamie's list of personality facets.  I told Teri that I thought she had issues that she needed help working out. Her response was that I was the clinically depressed one. She refused to see a counselor because she wants to revert back to the angst filled teenager who scrawled bad poetry everywhere.  That's what this al boils down to. Teri felt that she could never be a poet with me. I think that in two years I was the subject of only one positive poem and several negative ones. She says I stifled that part of her with television and constant noise. Whatever. I don't hate her passions. I still revert to poetry every once in a while because it's so basic and clean.  I have to work a 17 hour day today. It sucks. If your in Indy tonight come to Howl at the Moon and ask for Bruce the Aloha guy.

      So this is about me. I’m 22, almost 23. Pretty exciting start isn’t it. I’m a wage slave for a computer point of sale company. My hours suck and my pay isn’t that great. I’ve been there a month but I’m starting to look for another job. I am on a really big kick of escaping right now. I’ll tell you why in a little bit.  I graduated from DePauw University in May. College was not something I excelled at. I have an attention problem with academia. (I can't lie. I can't pay attention to much of anything) I did okay in my computer classes but they weren’t hard anyway. I always got so excited for my other classes but several weeks into them I got bored and then depressed. I hated feeling trapped by deadlines and artificial stress. Would the world have ended if I didn’t get my paper in by 5PM? I doubt it.  College gave me a lot of things: some friends, some acquaintances, an ex-wife. That’s what this is all about. I got married on August 2nd 2003. That’s right, one year ago today, it isn’t ironic, it just all crashed down on me yesterday.  I guess I shouldn’t call her an ex-wife; she’s really just an estranged wife. My lawyer seems to be a little slow in getting me out of this marriage. I want to have her erased from my mind Eternal Sunshine style. Teri is my Clementine.  Not all of this can come out today. I must be slow and diligent until everything is out. This is for therapy.  To be Continued…

      First off. This is therapy. If I bad mouth someone or something it's venting. If it pisses you off tell me about it but don't expect me to really care. I'll post some details about myself later on. I doubt I will be much more interesting than a scab you can never stop picking.  Bruce
