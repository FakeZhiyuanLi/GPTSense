        CHANGES       I still don't know what I was waiting for     And my time was running wild     A million dead-end streets     Every time I thought I'd got it made     It seemed the taste      was not so sweet     So I turned myself to face me     But I've never caught a glimpse     Of how the others must see the faker     I'm much too fast to take that test          Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes     (Turn and face the stranger)     Ch-ch-Changes     Don't want to be a richer man     Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes     (Turn and face the stranger)     Ch-ch-Changes     Just gonna have to be a different man     Time may change me     But I can't trace time          I watch the ripples change their size     But never leave the stream     Of warm impermanence and     So the days float through my eyes     But still the days seem the same     And these children that you spit on     As they try to change their worlds     Are immune to your consultations     They're quite aware      of what they're going through          Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes     (Turn and face the stranger)     Ch-ch-Changes     Don't tell them to grow up and out of it     Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes     (Turn and face the stranger)     Ch-ch-ChangesWhere's your shame     You've left us up to our necks in it     Time may change me     But you can't trace time          Strange fascination, fascinating me     Changes are taking the pace     I'm going through          Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes     (Turn and face the stranger)     Ch-ch-Changes     Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers     Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes     (Turn and face the stranger)     Ch-ch-Changes     Pretty soon you're gonna get      a little older     Time may change me     But I can't trace time     I said that time may change me     But I can't trace time     The above lyrics go out to Shawzies and pooh bear love ya's      Urlzie

        Within You    How you turn my world You precious thing. You starve and near exhaust me.  Everything I've done, I've done for you. I move the stars for no one.  You've run so long. You've run so far. Your eyes can be so cruel, Just as I can be so cruel, Oh I do believe in you. Yes I do.  Live without your sunlight. Love without your heartbeat. (Falsetto) I... I... Can't.. live.. within.. you...

      Hey,  Didn't do much today, just went to few uni open days, they were all really basic. So now im back and really bored!!!!  I guess i'll lets ya's all know a little about me, Im 17, irish and just love to have fun. I got great friends and fantastic enemies. What really ticks me off are ppl who lie, who are snobby and just really selfish ppl... but then again I love to be around funny and intellectually stimulating ppl.  My favourite colours is green/yellow Lucky number is 38 favourite music is a mix of robbie william, matchbox 20 and a twist of old style - elton, bowie, elvis etc.  Currently in year 12 and loving school, altho i can't wait to get out, i wanna travel- see the whole world. Especially Eygpt, Peru, Guatemala, Rome, Paris, Germany all those types of places- i cant wait   Oh well lunch is ready  must go  love Urleen
