'we' were lyk.. WOW.. lol.. cause the place looks so grand and the ceiling is lyk so high!!.. haha.. may seem lyk 'we' are kiddys rite?.. but it's true.. lol.. everythin' went quite smoothly.. to my surprise.. i didn't tremble at all!.. hah.. a miracle!.. lol!!.. so we sang 'sing and rejoice' first.. den 'one song many voices'.. followed by the MDIS coperate song.. after tt the combined choir jus sat behind all the audience and as usual hear all the borin' speeches.. after the whole thingy.. there was reception.. i guess everyone was hungry.. at least tt is fer me jasmine nellie and hui wen.. it was arnd 12.20 at tt time.. and i had tuition at 2!.. and mrs tan said tt we had to meet in the holdin' room at 1.15!!.. im so so so gonna be late.. it was lyk later den 1.30 when we left the place.. so on the bus i called my tuition teacher and told her i'd be late.. on the bus.. i fell asleep.. felt so tired.. woke up at 6 and was awake till den.. i was dead beat!.. our bus arrived first.. so we went to the music room and waited fer ms yeap to be back.. i was totally runnin' late.. when she came and 'brief'ed us.. her tone was kinda lyk the SICKENIN' ms tay!.. im started to hate ms yeap.. she's becomin' detestable.. but i guess i can't change the fact.. after we were dismissed.. i went to the minimart to get a choc bar.. den jasmine nellie and i walked to the bus stop together..  on the bus with jasmine.. i realised tt i was just too later fer tuition.. it was 2.40 already.. wat's the point of goin' there.. so again i gave my teacher a call and cancelled the tuition.. i got back home.. read some magazines and fell asleep on the sofa..
