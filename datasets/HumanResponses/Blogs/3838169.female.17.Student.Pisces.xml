      i'm at work.  and i'm bored.  there is absolutely nothing happening here.  i'm only working with one other guy.  pretty exciting.  so a pilot came in.  he's here to pick up a six month little girl who has a big hole in her heart.  he's going to bring her back to michigan.  but he's really mean. i'm starting to understand when people say that the pilots are big dicks.  larry mcarin...or whatever, this old packer player who has his own pre-game show now...or something...called in to get his plane ready like 2 hours ago...he's still not here yet.  i've heard that he's a big jerk too...but there are conflicting stories.  the guy i'm working with right now seems to think that everyone is a 'real nice guy'...so we'll see.  larry was nice on the phone.  but i think it's kinda funny, he wanted his plane fueled up to the top [topped off]and now it's sitting out in the sun cuz he said he would be here like an hour ago...and it's fricking 80 degrees outside...so the fuel is heating up and it's leaking out of some cracks b/c of the pressure.  oh well, it's his own damn fault.  besides he's got enough money to make up for all that lost fuel.    the little girl finally has come from the hospital.  oh, and larry just walked in.  somebody told me that his finger is all messed up back from when he played football.  ooh!!  i just saw it.  yawza!  he's really skinny.  he looks buff on tv...hhhmmm...that doesn't give me high hopes.  i'd probably look like roseann under the camera and lights.  the sick girl people needed some gate opened to get their car through....i didn't know how to do it.  i'm really bad at my job.  i've only been on for like a week...but still.  i suck!!!!!  i have no idea what the hell i'm doing every.  and i haven't been able to win one single fricken game of solitare...and that really pisses me off.  i need a cigarette like no tomorrow.    bush is coming to town on wednesday.  (blah, ugh, yuck, puke!!!!!)  he's taking a bus up here from milwaukee, then leaving from the airport with AIR FORCE ONE....dun dun dun....i work that day, so at least i'll get to see the plane.  the secret service is scheduled to be here on monday.  they're probably going to shoot me come wednesday...i'm not going to be able to keep my mouth shut...i'll be yelling and cursing bush all morning.    N: SICK BABY is getting ready to take off.  rounding the runway.  ok, i lost sight of em.  oh, well.  yeah, this is the stupidest entry in the world, i'm just going to do myself a favor and shut the eff up. lata matsen

      So, I have the ashlee simpson show playing in the background.  i really should get to cleaning my room.  i spent a total of an hour cleaning out my closet yesterday, i still have about 1/2 of it left to do.  but good news is i have 3 garbage bags full of stuff for my rumage sale (on top the 4 bags of clothes in my trunk)...AND i filled a huge box full of shoes!!!  (Everyone is really happy with me because i'm kind of a shoe slut...so now i'm down to 60 pairs!!)  i should so have my own reality tv show.  i think i came up with the concept like 10 years ago.  when i was little i swore that there were cameras following me around...i used to act for the 'cameras'....and i know that i would have a way fucking better show than these loonies on the tube.  my life is a soap opera.    ugh, i don't really wanna clean my room.  blah!!!!!!  so, anyway, i was zooming around all these other peoples blogs yesterday...and i noticed most of them were like video or photo journals.  i felt pretty left out.  because i'm just this old school online journal punk.  so since i don't have a scanner and my web camera is shitty...i made some pretty pictures on my paint thing.  but i can't get them to go on the page.  so i guess it was just a big waste of time.  maybe i'll ask for help or something.  i don't know.  i guess i don't have much to say right now.  i'm just rambling off stupid stuff. leave it to me.  i have to get up so early tomorrow for work.  ugh.  i'm out of my diet cherry 7up, which tastes like horse dung...but there is absolutely nothing to drink in this god forsaken house (all the good pop is in my dad's trunk...that selfish soda whore)  lol.  yeah, i can't believe i just wrote 'lol'.  i really need to go and shove my head in a bucket of water.  now there's this commerical about smores on.  i haven't had a smore in years.  i shoudl really do that sometime.  if i become uuber desperate i can do it in a microwave...but those never tasted the same.  in fact, when i would have babysitters be all like "you wanna make smores?!?!?!" and then i would get all excited...and then they'd just pop the shit into the microwave...i just remember being so let down.  i don't think i have the 3 ingredients anyway.  i'm going to go 'clean my room' (really watch more ashlee simpson...sit and seethe that i don't have my own damn tv show) hasta. matsen

      i'm a shedding demon.  worse than my cat.  it's been this way for years.  i don't have bald spots or anything....but really, clumps...handfuls of hair fall out at will.  it's funny, i guess.  taking a shower is interesting.  the tiled wall is full of hair that falls out during shampooing...and i have nowhere else to put it.  but i do have hair all over my car.  and sometimes one will sneak up from nowhere and BAM wind up in my mouth or something disgusting like that.  ah, the joys of me.  i think that the left side of me is dying.  just the left side.  first, i have this cut on my wrist from "work" (which is really from me rubbing a key into my skin one night because i 'broke up' with my boyfriend (we're back together...again....aye)) and i can't stop picking at it (i have a picking fixation or something)...so now my whole arm hurts because it's infected, and there are these little red lines that run from the cut to my veins....so i think i'm going to die.  and the left side of my neck has been killing me, along with my ear and shoulder.  plus, i get pains right under my left boob.  geez.  i think this is some dragged out heart attack of the rarest form.    my boyfriend wants me to come pick him up.  which is fine.  except he lives kinda far away, and we know that gas prices haven't been that cooperative lately.  but i know that he's just going to try to have sex with me all day long and i'm not going to get anything done in my bedroom.  hhhmmm.  i guess he's a good thing to project my laziness onto....gotta have a scapegoat.  muahahaha.  i'm a bitch, but the world is getting over it.  so i'm off to face the open roads. peace matsen

      so yesterday, on top of fucking up everything at my job, i recieved my paycheck.  (woohoo)  which, instead of wisely handing it over to my father to cover my lapse in care insurance, or rushing it directly to my savings account, i have decided that I will spend the ENTIRE thing on....(take a guess...)...MYSELF!!!!  Baha!  i plan to buy paint for my bedroom (it will most likely sit in the garage for a few months, until my mom or dad become so agrivated by my laziness...they will paint my room for me...or...i might find alien-like energy within myself, so that i actually complete a project in the next 3 days)------i also plan to buy a shit load of clothes for myself.  maybe go tanning.  buy me some cigs.  ah....opportunity is endless.  currently, though, i'm just sitting on my arse, dreaming of all the fun things i am about to accomplish/waste money on.  my mom needs to call me from work so i can get my ss card...........for my bogus work permit...aha, i found it in an old purse...now i must go, little brother accompanying me and is a wee bit impatient.... matsen

      Why I love google:  blogger.  (At least I think this is powered by google.  You know, I always chose google over slow-ass lycos or yahoo, even back in the day.  I think the reason google has become so popular is all because of me.)  *You see, there are cameras that follow me around, and the jokes on the other end copy everything i do...I swear!*  It's a drizzly fourth of july.  My mom is running around in a silk cheetah print nightgown and oversized slippers dodging the rain to grab her ashtray.  Another morning cig for her.  As I was reaching for some water to down my overrated antidepressants this morning, my cat starred at me dead in the eyes.  I think she knows I plan to betray her.  I just really want another kitty.   So far this morning, I've: laid in bed, dialed random numbers on my cellphone, tried in vain to get my boyfriend to wake up and talk to me, and squeezed my fat.  Ah, another day begins.  For some reason, I think that my midget-like grandmother (whom I love, but she does look like a midget) is having some fourth of july party.  Which is great.  She always has good food.  And the newspaper.  (So I can find myself another job, while I pack on those pounds)  You know, my mom kinda of looks like a very large midget.  I guess that's not really good news for me.  We look a lot alike.  Hhhhmmm.  Only she's a little more crazy than I am.  Right now it's in the wee-hours of the morning (like 10-ish) and she's been up cleaning, cleaning, CLEANING since god knows when.  Besides the nicotine, she's definitely addicted to laundry, ironing, vacuuming, dusting, MAKING BEDS!!, and everything that goes along with it.  *sigh*  She's nuts.  I just read the last few sentences to my mom.  She thought it was great, except for the "she's nuts" part...which she got all offended by.  You would think after how many years, she would get my playful, cynical humor.  I just don't think her mind can comprehend that type of stuff though.  She's too into the ~**(daisies and kind words and sunshine)**~ aww!   My little brother just walked downstairs.  Now we're having a lovely, family conversation.  Minus my dad, who's hard at work with the crazy people (seriously, he works at a mental hospital).  I went there once because there's this big controversy going on with the building.  I wrote about what I saw/experienced.  It was great: it was all the truth, nothing sugarcoated.  I should have sent it into the papers.  But then my dad probably would have gotten fired.  His early county retirement and pension whizzing out the window.   Well, I think i'm going to enjoy this gray fourth of july now.  Maybe grab myself a cigarette as well.  Ahhhh. matsen
