      well, exams may suck but they're better than 'assessment week'. stupid new idea my school had - lets just have all the tests in class time! and yes, that means NO study leave! *sulks* they're so mean. i look forward to study leave. oh well. i suppose i'll just have to wait till the end of the year.  i actually had one of my assessments today which i felt like i was completely unprepared for (i really was unprepared, come to think of it... i was finishing my notes on it all through the previous class) but when i got in there it was all good and i nearly finished it. still got 2 hours of class time left to finish it too. hehe. go me!  phillipa and nicola still believe that i'm blind which is absolutely hilarious. i got contacts but never told them, so now they're trying to convince the teacher that i can't read the board but she doesnt believe them lol. mwahaha. i'll see how long it takes them to figure it out :p
