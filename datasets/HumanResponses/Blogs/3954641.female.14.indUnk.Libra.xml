      went to the esplanade today to watch 'faces by horta van hoye'. the theatre studio is so hard to find... it took me 15 minutes to find the place! and when i got there the doors weren't even open yet... met roxy and sum yi there, so we went out to the rooftop to view the scenery. really beautiful! you can see the whole of the bay, and there's this tent where people play live music! they were playing jazz, really great. why can't i live in a place like that? gotta go back to the esplanade sometime.

      i've been writing the whole of today. not about orlando bloom, that'll come later... right now i'm in production of a harry potter story. harry falls for thos girl he met at the yule ball. it's still a bit jerky, the storyline... so i'm gonna have to patch it up a bit. but when i'm done, it'll be the greatest! okay, not maybe the greatest. the story's really short, it seems only a chapter long. but never mind. why am i so into writing nowadays? the next one i write will be about orlando bloom! i think.

      went to watch [shrek 2] today!! it was hilarious, i was laughing almost the whole duration of the movie. donkey is the funniest! and puss in boots... keeps giving those glassy, innocent looking eyes, so adorable! and there were the three blind mice (of whom one fell into a hole), pinnochio (who denied wearing ladies' underwear and made his nose grow longer), and all sorts of other fairy tale characters! its like a mix of all the nursery rhymes, fairytales, and all that stuff. i regret not watching the original shrek; i love it!

      clay aiken returns!! he sang 'fantasy' last night... together with the top four finalists, and would you believe it latoya got voted out! that's so unfair! i thought jasmine was the worst last night... her voice is definately not for disco. maybe hawaii was too over-anxious that jasmine wouldn't make it and made 100 calls per person. jasmine didn't even get into the bottom 2!! fantasia was in the bottom two which isn't such a big deal, she wasn't her best last night... but latoya! latoya london!

      cheryl, annabelle, ashley, and almost everyone else - all experienced blackouts last night, from 10pm to 12mn! they had to go without air-con! me, on the other hand. i am so lucky, i had full electricity. if any one of the blackout victims are reading this, you'd probably want to murder me. the last time i had a blackout was about 4 years ago! i'm lucky when it comes to sleep. in SPARKc, everyone else had to use thin sleeping bags, whilst mine was so cushion-like that it was almost my bed back home! but i've gotta admit, i didn't like not having a blackout, they're normally really fun.

      [euro 2004] updates. june 26th, france-greece, greece won 1-0. france have got zinedine zidane on their team! what happened?... june 27th, sweden against holland. score at 0-0, holland win 5-4 on penalties. must've been boring, since no goals were scored... june 28, czech republic against denmark, score was 3-0 to the czechs. lucky streak for them... this is madness! all of europe's greatest teams are out of the running! england, france, sweden and denmark. what happened to you lot? keep strivin', don't let us down!

      watched [stuart little] on tv! stuart's an adorable orphaned mouse, who was adopted by the little family. (who keep a pet cat). a mouse with a pet cat! he's even got a really nice red carbriolet! (that's a roofless car.) how come stuart gets to drive, even though he's not yet 16? i want my driving license! after that, watched [selena]. brilliant movie, about the life story of selena, played by jLo. pity selena died in the end, she was shot... great person, great voice. if she'd lived, she'd be gloria estefan the second.

      england's out, argh! i get to watch my first match of the [euro 2004] and i see my favourite team getting busted!? and the refree didn't allow england's second goal! unfair, even if the ball only just crossed the line it did anyway! the refree's biased! scores as follows: england - owen (3) and lampard (115 et); portugal - postiga (83), rui costa (110 et)... penalty shootout, portugal win 6-5. david beckham seems to have a problem with penalties recently. i'm guessing it's all the bad publicity he's been getting... but never mind, becks! we're all for you!

      re-written some of [the last chance], so that i've re-invented kaelin's character. instead of being such an astronomy guru, kaelin is now a reckless all-rounder exceling in COMC and astronomy. i'd based kaelin upon myself, but i really over-exaggurated the part about astronomy. kaelin's character is now, more than ever, like yours truly. its almost as if it were me in there! also, england played croatia last night, won 4-2!! england's in the quarter-finals, celebration!

      bought [the diary of anne frank] today... i've read that book once before, but i liked it so much that i decided on buying it for myself in the end. plus, also got a cd, [borrowed heaven], by the corrs. i can't decide which track i like best! wish i could keep up with the [euro 2004], but i don't have cable tv. it's fascinating to watch. before i forget, england lost to france 2-1, 13 june. but i'm hoping that england will score croatia (june 21). on a more delightful note, england won switzerland 3-0 yesterday!!

      finished writing chapter 3, 4, 5 and 6 of [the last chance], currently midway writing chapter 7. i'm slightly in front of schedule, i didn't plan chapter 6 to be written 'til tomorrow! i haven't gotten any reviews other than the original four, though, which were written about the first two chapters. hoping for more reviews! trying to get dad to find out the scores of the [euro 2004] for me, can't wait for the quarter finals; channel5 is gonna broadcast live! (i don't have cable tv.)

      uploaded my story onto [ urlLink godrics-hollow.net ], and i've finally given it a name, [the last chance]. people who haven't written before don't know this, but writing isn't as easy at it may seem. if anyone appreciates my work in the slightest, bother to review it, i'd probably be jumping around like a jackrabbit. i've written chapter 2, and i'm gonna start to write chapter 3 sometime soon. i haven't thought up the full plot yet, but there's something between ron and hermione. definately.

      went to watch [home on the range] with ashley today! it was really funny, about these three cowgirls who go chasing after a wanted cattle hustler (a  fat  guy named alameda  slim ), so that they can get the reward money and save their farm back, 'coz it was gonna be auctioned off. this disney movie shows, in total perfection, its the west at its best. wow... that sounded like a movie review for [home on the range]! ok. i'm a raving lunatic, i know.

      i've just started writing yet another fanfiction. i'm clueless as to what to name it for the moment, it's a harry potter story... harry's not invited to stay with the weasleys, because of the NEWTS, so mrs weasley won't let ron play over the summer holidays (harry's in his 7th year). so harry leaves the dursleys early, and takes the knight bus to diagon alley. nothing about voldemort in this, but there's gonna be something about draco malfoy. second chapter still in production. this fanfic's gonna be a really long one, almost like a novel!

      went to watch [harry potter and the prizoner of azkaban] today, i think chris columbus did a better job with the movies than alfonso cuaron. cuaron may be a more experienced director, but i don't think he knows how to deal with harry potter movies. there are so many areas of the book which he cut off... and then the story moves way too fast for people to actually follow on. and then, in the movie hagrid only brought one hippogriff to class, and there are supposed to be more hippogriffs than just buckbeak! alfonso cuaron is just not cut out for harry potter movies! get that.

      found another fanfiction site! [ urlLink godrics-hollow.net ], there's loads of great harry potter fanfics. most of them i haven't read yet, they're way too many! so far, my favourite pieces are [ urlLink the dream ] and its sequel, [ urlLink the courage to love e]. it's so touching, draco malfoy going through so much just to be with ginny weasley! i'm actually starting to feel sympathy for a slytherin? i must be going mad. i've lost it.

      bought a really nice  seed  shirt today at tangs today... if there's a good time to shop, its now. the great singapore sale is on until the end of july! *yay* i was supposed to watch [confessions of a teenage drama queen] with ashley today, but at the last minute her parents wouldn't let her go. unfair! so i didn't get to go, either. never mind... there's still [harry potter and the prizoner of azkaban] to look forward to! and i can always catch [confessions] another time... if it's still running!

      films that are based on age-old classics truly are magical, even if the story is nothing like the original. take, for say, [confessions of an ugly stepsister], which was just shown on television. cinderella is 'clara', and her two stepsisters are actually nice people! clara's not so obedient after all. in the beginning, clara thought that her fairy godmother was a witch (she had a black cloak on)! oh, and clara's father is alive, too. one of clara's stepsisters, (ruth) is a bit dumb. the other (iris) is very much intelligent and quite an artist at that! the stepmother's still a horrible person.

      i'm due to start the first chapter of [secret snowfall] very soon. yes, i know what you're thinking. i've been going on about it for so long and i still haven't even written a single chapter? i totally agree that i'm way behind time. but my weekday afternoon schedule's packed to the brim, and there's school in the morning. the only time i'm free, nowadays, is the weekends, but lately those have been full up, too. so it's been quite a bit of a squeeze these few days, and now that i finally get time... see if i can complete three chapters by the end of this week!

      just came back from [mean girls]! it was great. but how regina ever became queen bee, i'm absolutely clueless... cady's way better looking! okay, so maybe it was because cady was away in africa for twelve years. but there's no denying, regina's lifestyle more than rocks. i mean, how many people get such a huge house and a jaccuzi in their bathroom? it's totally awesome! i wish i lived in africa, like cady did! that scene when cady was with the leopard cub was so sweet! if lindsay lohan really did get to hold that leopard cub, she's the luckiest girl alive.

      found it! okay, dan's got two dogs, not one. but i'm going to make it seem as though he's only got one dog... his other dog will seem non-existant in the story. i can't handle two dogs, one is more than enough for a story. i'm going to choose binka over nugget; the website that i got the news from doesn't say if nugget's a male or female, but binka's definately a female. they're both siberian huskies. grâce à [danradcliffe.com] pour la informations. [secret snowfall] will have a lot to do with dogs, of that i'm quite certain!

      i'm probably going to start fencing next year. the ministry's got some new rule, pupils need to have at least one sports CCA; if it suits, fencing for me! it looks really cool... especially after [pirates of the carribean]! i've been wanting to try fencing for ages. the only problem - i'm quite packed already, with something new to fit in i think my timetable will start bursting at the seams. i'm already taking chinese orchestra, piano and whatnot... well, there's nothing i can do about it. for science today, watched a david attenborough documentary; no doubt, they're excellent! no wonder he was knighted.

      dan's dog will play a huge part in [secret snowfall], of which the storyline i've only recently come up with. i think his dog's a siberian husky, or is it an alaskan malamute? i'm not sure. that probably means, i'm going to have to check it out... along with the name. darn it, i can't remember a thing about his dog! don't get me wrong - i totally love dogs. it's just, i've only come across that information once... i know i should've taken that data down! okay, it's like this: the dog goes missing, the girl finds it, she brings it back, in the process meeting dan. there, simple. ciao!

      performed at  parco bugis junction  today, chinese orchestra. most of the orchestra members were nervous, cheryl in particular was panicky beyond description. fiona asked if i was scared; it seemed i was the only one who wasn't! even those who'd perormed before were quite nervy. dunno why, but i've never got stage fright before in my life. the performance was about half an hour long. daniel ong was there!! like, he's totally my favourite guy dj! (fav gal dj is carrie chong.) he talked to me! okay, so it was only to confirm if my section was the flute section. but daniel ong talked to me!!

      went to a chinese orchestra concert by raffles girls' school today! it was great, especially since i'm in one myself. by that, i mean i'm in a chinese orchestra. guest performance by the indian orchestra; truth be told, i wasn't too fond of the indian performance. it was a bit... soft for my liking. i prefer pieces with drums in them, loud ones, rather like the chinese orchestra. the indian orchestra's drums were minute! never mind about that, anyway. 2½ hours! izza and cheryl were there too. to pass the time during the 15-minute interval, i tried to write. but i didn't get too far; writer's block.

      i don't think i've mentioned the score for the [euro 2004] finals, have i? well, here they are, then. 1-0 to greece, embarrasing for portugal, that was. no extra time, no penalty shootouts. it really took all the fun away from the match, there being only one goal and all. i should start work on a second fanfiction piece quite soon, though i'm not too sure exactly when. should it be based on orlando bloom or otherwise? oh yeah, before i forget. i'm going to finish [the last chance] quite soon, for all you fans of that story out there, so keep your eyes peeled!

      i cannot believe this. greece won [euro 2004]! that is not fair, at all. why does greece have to win? why couldn't it be portugal? i've got a million questions that are demanding to be answered, right now. greece, of all countries! and there i was, thinking that portugal would win. hell, cristiano ronaldo's on their team! he's like, one of the best for his age! only nineteen and on the portugal national team? truly remarkable. but my support for cristiano ronaldo doesn't mean that my support for england has died down. i'm still bent on england to beat the rest sometime soon!

      the finals to [euro 2004] are here! by right i should be sleeping now. but i don't care, soccer's more important. update on semi-finals, portugal won holland 2-1. portugal - ronaldo (26), maniche (58)... holland - van nistelrooy (63). czech republic against greece, greece won, 1-0 by dellas in the 105th minute. very unexpcted, but i'm certain that portugal will knockout greece at the end of it all. the next tournament will be the [fifa 2006], i think. rooting for england to smash the records, when that comes! beckham can't let all us english fans down!

      went to watch [spiderman 2] today! i'd got front-row seats, all the others were sold out. for every show! but it wasn't that bad after all. is tobey maguire cute or what? he's got this funny accent in his voice tone, as if he's not quite yet broken his voice. but it only makes him much cuter! there's this mad scene when spiderman takes the lift down, because his web-blasters aren't working! there's a whole lot of other crazy scenes, but they're too many to name. i don't doubt its 5-star rating one bit, tobey rules!

      HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE!! the official title of book 6 is out! there was rumour that it would be named [harry potter and the pillar of storge]. the pillar of storge, i ask you! i'm guessing that the 'half-blood prince' is neville. it makes sense, seeing how jk said that the 'prince' would be neither harry nor voldemort. ron and draco are cancelled out, they're pure-bloods. but neville's half-squib, and also the alternative to harry potter, dumbledore mentioned in OoTP. half-blood doesn't always mean muggle, you know...

      4 days to the olympics! seeing how today's national day, school's out for both today and tomorrow! such are the festivities. there's a whole load of shows that i'm planning to watch today on television, but i'm not too sure about tomorrow... perhaps i'll go watch [ella enchanted] or [catwoman]? recently, i've taken quite a liking for shakespearean plays. most of the class think i'm mad - a thirteen-year old reading shakespeare? it sounds rather odd, of that i'm quite aware. i've only read [romeo and juliet] thus far, though. i can't decide which play to read next; [hamlet] or [macbeth]?

      5 days to the olympics! i'm planning to go to tao nan twice next month (september). once on teacher's day, which falls on september first. then, i'll return again on the 25th, when the school's having the annual mid-autumn festival celebrations. i heard from miss heng that we'll be staging a [tao nan idol] - something i simply cannot miss! i wonder if they allow the alumni to join in as well. no, i rather doubt it. just me trying to be ridiculous again. before i forget: though i'm not mentioning my writings that much anymore, it doesn't mean i'm quitting... contrary, i'm deliberately keeping the suspense!

      7 days to the olympics! this year's olympics theme might be [return to athens], but for me, i'm celebrating something different. [return to tao nan] might just about summarize it! strangely, annabelle, tori, cheryl and i weren't the only ex-tao nanites that went back. in fact, most of my old classmates were there too, even the boys. you wouldn't believe how different each of them look! thankfully, all the teachers that i intended to visit - mrs tan, mrs abidin, miss heng, and all the rest - didn't forget me. i haven't been there since january!

      10 days to the olympics! today, the newspaper ran an article - [survive the olympics]. this year's olympic mascots are  phevos and athena. according to mythology, athena's the goddess of the arts, wisdom and war. she's also the name behind  athens . i've never heard of phevos before, though. at athens, beanies of phevos and athena are on sale...  wish i could get both beanies! they're adorable. fencing and soccer are in the olympics after all! i don't know for sure, yet, if england's in the soccer olympics, but i hope they are! england: don't crash during the preliminaries!
