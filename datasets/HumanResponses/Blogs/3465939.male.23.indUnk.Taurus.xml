      I know this has all been gone over before. But what the fuck is Redhats's problem? How can they charge $ for Linux? It doesn't make any sense! I'm trying to get my RHCE but I have to use Fedora (since it's the closest thing to Redhat) for all my learnin'. It's really quite irratating. Oh well... I do have a copy of Redhat Enterprise Linux ES (paid for by my J.O.B.) but I really want a copy of Redhat Enterprise Desktop. But unfortunately the cheapest version is still over $2000! I really hate software companies sometimes. Bah! I'm gonna go now.

      Well, I'm not really in the mood to write all that much right now. I started this whole blog thing on a whim. We'll see how far I actually take it.  .:Bob:.

      Tired and hungry.  That's how I feel right now.   That's about all I feel right now.  And I don't have a car so I'll have to walk to the McDonald's next door and get some crap there since that's the only food within 2 miles.  Damn.

      Ok, so I guess for some people working 12 days in a row isn't a big deal. But I'm a lazy lazy bastard. I'm on day 8 now and I feel like I am living at work. I really can't wait for this Sunday. I'm going to see APC (A Perfect Circle) in San Jose with my girlfriend Amy and my buddy 'The Mike'. That will provide a welcome change of pace from my ever so tedious job.  In other news: I helped my friend Ian put together a system this weekend. Correction: I attempted to put together a system. You see what happened is we went to Fry's in Sacto, dropped $1600 on some very nice components. Athlon64 3000, Asus motherboard, 1GB or RAM, Radeon 9800pro 256mb, 160GB SATA HD, Thermaltake Wingo case, and a DVD recorder. So we take everything home and I put the motherboard, CPU, memory and video card in the case to test them out. I plug everything in, double check to make sure it's all good and then press the power button... nothing ... I check again and push the power button ... nothing. I reseat all the components ... still nothing. So at this point it's Saturday night, 9 PM and I am pissed. Ian is leaving to move to upstat NY on Monday morning so it's going to be impossible for me to finish his system in time. So what did we do to remedy the situation? We went to our local bar and got extermely intoxicated.   Yesterday I was on call so I brought the mb, cpu, memory and video card in to work with me. I hooked them up to a known good power supply and lo and behold it booted up fine. So this morning I hopped in my parent's Assualt Van and drove back to Sacto (My Cadillac is currently dead, waiting for a new engine). I took the defective case into the return line where I am told to go grab a new one off the shelf. The problem is: There isn't any new ones. So after about 20 mins they decide to swap my bad power supply with the one from the display model. I take both cases over to the returns and spend the next 20 minutes watching some fool try to swap the power supplies. Man I hate people some times. HOW HARD IS IT TO UNSCREW 4 SCREWS!? This guy took f o r e v e r. He was dropping screws as he was removing them; Then he couldn't get the power supply out of the case once it was unscrewed. Regardless I finally got the P/Ss swapped so tomorrow I will finally build up his badass system.
