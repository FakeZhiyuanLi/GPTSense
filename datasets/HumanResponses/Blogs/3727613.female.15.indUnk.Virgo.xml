        You're the motherly type. You love to take care of the one you love, and generally you can be a bit overprotective and possessive, but you know, that isn't always such a bad thing. At least you'll be a good mom in the future.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    the  sun  was great. i had  fun  at coney island.  i was  jealous  too.  he apologized. thats really sweet. but im an overprotective and possessive girl? -sigh-  my friends were mad cool. never seen the sophs had this much fun  together . one more time guys. you rock.

        Loneliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but it's there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time. You're afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.     urlLink   What Emotion Dominates you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    she came over today. i realized i missed spending afternoons with her. i guess its because i lost her for a while. maybe i needed that.  i have a motto:  paranoid bitches should go to hell.  because when you are, too many things go on in your mind. unnecessary stuff.   i am one of those bitches. ive been ignored. im being paranoid about it. its time to go to hell.

      people are so full of themselves. sheesh.  everything in the world is  not  as bad as it seems. stop wallowing in self pity.  and yes, we do have a purpose for being alive. you would be able to see your purpose better if you stopped crying.  you have your two choices. [to be happy] or [to be pitied, because you are pitiful] .i.dont.think.you.need.anyone.to.choose.for.you.   sheesh
