       ST-JEAN BAPTISTE DAY     Did you know that way back when, this holiday had nothing to do with politics.....and it really had to do with JOHN THE BAPTIST... Well I just found out myself.   Today had to be in my book, one of my most incredible day ever...Today was my Christian Baptism and I feel incredible. I was surrounded by my family. My mom, my husband and my 2 daughters. My brother Dan and his wife Janice , who is an incredible person, mother and also help me go thru very hard times and showed me the way to God, without pushing. They also brought their son and daughter. It was most unfortunate that my oldest brother Mike and his family were not there.   I found the Lord when I was at my lowest of everything. It is too bad, that only then, we think of Him. Because when things are going great, you feel you do not need Him.  He has been part of our lives now for a while and I have never been happier since then. People who know me and have not seen me in a year or so, cannot believe the changes in me and my family. Before I found the Lord, anytime anyone talked about Him, I got angry because it seemed that He was not there for me. Little that I know that He was there but I didn't listen.   Before you judge religion, always take a good look inside your soul and see what your true beliefs are and then ask yourself if you believe in the Bible and what it says.   I did that and found that I had completely lost the values of the Lord and what He preached. I have found comfort in reading His word and praising Him. So for me today,  St-Jean Baptiste is more then an occasion to celebrate our National Day.....It is my Baptism...   We finished this amazing night with fireworks in the parks with our friends and neighbors, who are the same.   I want to thank all the good wishes I've received today by my church family and from friends and family that couldn't be there. Thank you to My Pastor and the Youth Pastor that got into the water with me and to God in giving me salvation and re-birth.   Have a great Sunday and Holiday Monday and...... Be good

        PROM NIGHTS ARE HERE    My great friend son John, had his prom last night and it just brought me back to mine. We're it was and the things girls still talk about all year. They and we, talked about everything from what we we're going to wear to what time our parents would let us stay out till.... Well, let me bring you back to mine.,   I graduated high school in 1981. My prom date was a nice guy named Tony, who later on became my first husband. I went looking for the perfect dress that we said "Jazz Ballet Dancer " So none of that long draby dress or even the ones that looked like lampshade covers, because you knew that one day, you we're sure to actually HAVE to wear those, because your cousin that had no taste, would make you and 6 other bridesmaids wear IT with matching apple green shoesa and umbrella.   So back to my prom, I finally found a knee lenght chiffon, little strap number in the worst color anyone with blond hair can wear, BEIGE. It really like the fact that it was different. That morning, I went to the hairdresser and had a wrap-around french-braid doo. But the piece of residence, I bought real dancers shoes They cost me more then the dress and the doo combined. Now to complete the ensemble, my corsage was a yellow carnation.   We all know that matching outfits we're in then, so my date could be dressed in a BROWN TUXEDO with really shinny brown plastic shoes. Boy we made quite a couple.   We left in his sister's brown 77 Civic Honda that actually matched us..... went to KONTIKI'S for the traditional graduation drink, a green volcanic drink that just looked good and tasted like kool-aid, but it was the place to go then.   The rest of the evening went off very well, my date didn't speak to anyone since I went to french school and he didn't speak french....made the night a little long.   But to wrap it up, no limo's, no heavy drinking, no overnight bars, but I stay filled with great memories of my school years.   I still have my corsage, the shoes and dress are long gone, so is the prom date for that matter.... but I still get excited over anyones PROM night.   Have a great Saturday evening and......Be good

       THE LAUGHTER OF CHILDREN    The laughter of children is angelic....It is the most amazing thing to hear.With my daughter help, I had a terrific day. I started my day with trying to wake up my 4 year old and ended up in bed with her, cuddling, laughing and being totally silly. My day continued with a spring in my step, a smile on my face and a memory of my time with my baby girl.   This is a very important reason to get up in the morning and to rush back home from work at night, for the laughter of your children, the I LOVE MOMMY, the drawing that they specially made for you that looks like just lines to you, but tells a story for them. For me, they are my best cure for my depression. They helped me without knowing. They knew that mommy was not feeling well and put a blanket over me when I was just dazed and confused. Brought me their favorite dollies to confort me. I owe my new life to them and when they are old enough to understand what they did, I will tell them how proud I was of them for doing this.   It is a miracle to have a child, I know, but it is a priviledge to raise a child....DON'T ABUSE THEM, DON'T HURT THEM AND IF YOU DO, GET HELP.......   Have a great evening and ....Be good

       WHY DOES IT STILL FEEL LIKE A MONDAY    For some reason unknown to me, today feel's like a Monday. I have a bad headache (thank God it is not a migraine) since last night. And I feel really down. I am feeling very alone right now and I shouldn't. I have family and friends all around me. I also have God looking down on me and just that should be making me feel better but it doesn't.   Maybe I am the point that all the medication that I am on are starting to counter effect....I don't know... Maybe I just need rest...or just to write about it....   Anyways, the're are days like this once in a while and let's hope this one goes fast..   Have a great HAPPY day and....Be good

        ANOTHER MONDAY     Welcome back to another Monday. The worst day of the week. In my mind, it is the one that makes or brakes your week. In my case, I took it off because it is always my worst day. It starts on Sunday evening and it finishes on Monday afternoon. It only started back last August. Waking up to it, made me cry and want to stay in my bed all day. That is when I realize that I must have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or something like that. I endure this for 2 months, getting worst everyday, specially Mondays.  Until I called my family doctor and he told me that I did not have CFS or anything like that but that I was severely depressed. He has known me all my life, knows every little think that I have endured in my life. I could not accept it because I am a strong womem. I have a family to take care of. I have a important job. And depression only happended to weak and vulnerable people.   It has been a long recovery and I still have downs as you can see but medication and finding what you are about and who you are, helps a great deal.   Will talk again about this...   But for now, have a great evening and let's talk later....Be good

        HAPPY FATHER'S DAY TO ALL THE GREAT DADS OUT THERE    Good morning, Well today's is a very important day for my little girls because I am very fortunate to have great husband that is also an AMAZING DAD. I was not as fortunate as them. My mom left my dad because of physical abuse caused by alcoolism, when I was only 3 and they separeted a few years later. Now remember that in the late 60's and early 70's it was not very popular to be divorced. My mom became both our parents since my dad was not very involved in our lives, unless it was his weekend of the month to see us. I went to boarding school and in my grade, I, with another girl named Kathy O, we're the only ones who had divorced parents. Now if you look at today's school and just pick one class, it really would be the opposite.  So in my eyes, the DADS of today, may he be single or married or widowed, may he be a grand-father in place of a dad or an uncle for that matter, for a little child, the role that a father has, in their lives, is a very important one and they should not be missing any part of it because in the long run, they will regret it, as my father did and still does. In my case, my Grandad was the man in my life but was called up to Heaven to become an Angel, in your eyes, to soon, HAPPY FATHER'S DAY GRANDAD FROM YOUR CENDRILLON.   P.S. My mom showed us to have respect for others and specialy to our father, so I did call him for Father's Day.....and prayed for him in church.   Have a great day and let's talk later.... Be good

      What can I say...  In a time where there is WAR... people are fighting about nothings... please... grow up people.  People not ordering French Fries but Freedom Fries....  poeple boohing national atems...  people acting like children.  What the heck is this all about.  We are only here for a very short time to start with and we find petty things to fight about.   When someone shows you love, friendship, help or prayers. Take It...For the longest time, I didn't and regretted it.  I find myself in situations where I am greatfull for the hand that is there to help me.    Think of what is happening and see yourself help and caring lots more...  On this Oscar night................Be good.

      Mid-Week Blues...  Already half the week gone.  Where does the time fly.  I am more busy now than when I was working.      I had my visit with the surgeon.  He confirmed that I need more surgery.  He basically wanted to admit me right away.  He was not very happy when I told him that I was not having him do the surgery but someone else near my home.  I guess he thinks I don't trust him...  Is he right !!!  Maybe....    Anyway, I have a appointment with a surgeon on May 6th and I am told that I am very lucky to have a date before the fall...  imaging that...  so I should have surgery around that time.  1 week in hospital and 3 to 5 weeks recovery at home but this time, no lifting NOTHING or NOONE for 6 months... Just in case.  Isn't that a great way to start the summer....  On the bright side, I have tickets to see Bruce Springsteen on April 19th.  I am going with my neighbor Mark.  His wife Lori(my friend) gave me to him for a night date.... hi hi hi   She is trusting and very pregnant.  Her dad even offered to drive us and pick us up...  how cool is that or is it becasue he doesn't trust us...  We are both Springsteen and Tom Jones fan...   Our spouses and the other neighbors think we are strange..  Well we are...  So on this, I promise feet massages to the girls so off I am to prepare the SPA.  Have a great evening and .........Be Good

      Welcome to my temporary home.......   I have lost my Grey Matter power because I changed URL and have no idea how to get it back so until I figure it out, this will be my new home....  So what has been up...  Well lots...  I am continuing my health saga.  I am seeing the surgeon tomorrow again but this time for incisional hernias.  I will need to get them repaired. So this means yet another surgery.  I am already loosing so much hair and I am freaked out about all this.    I feel very left out in so many situations right now and I am trying to help but it seems that it is not required.  I guess I am very paranoid.  Anyway, I know that if I am needed...  I am there...  So on this short post,    Be Good and I will be back real soon

      OK I am soooo confused..    I had my appointment with the surgeon yesterday.  He is a sweetheart and a great person.  His thinking is very on the ball and straight forward.  You basically know about all the medical problems I have had since November... well it all started with my conclusion that I needed help losing weight ~ Surgically ~.    Well he wants me to see a gastric surgeon before he operates. which won't be before the fall.  He feels that I can't loose weight on my own and KEEP IT OFF... Who Am I kidding...I can't even loose 5 pounds on my own...  I am sooooo confused.  I am trying to keep my mind off of this.  I am looking for web design sites with FREE graphics.... anyone know where I need to look...  I really appreciate it..  On this Jeudi soir,  have a nice tv night and ..........Be good

      To all my friends  ~ On and Off Line ~      ~ I wish you all a super Easter time.  He has risen for us ~     What a great day we had.  Service this morning was exceptional.  I love my church. I can't understand why everyone doesn't have their own church.  My Pastor came over this week to cheer me up. He is so baffled about the black cloud overing over my head.  I guess God is trying to send me a message but I am unclear what that message is...  We'll see...  Anyways, about   Bruce Springsteen   What a concert, great seats, could of spit on him ( if I wanted toooooo ).  My arms are killing me from my crutchs and my foot is now blue, but worth it...  I have no more voice and my hands are hurting from all the clapping. I don't remember ever feeling like this when I was younger and what about these tiny seats...  my behind will also have some bruise because of them... yerkkkkk..   Mark (my friend Lori whol is very pregnant and hates Springsteen) and I, enjoyed our date.  So for now I will go night night and speak to you later so...........Be Good and God Bless

      UPDATE....UPDATE....UPDATE  Ok first of all, my friend   ~ Lori ~  gave birth to her 3rd child on Monday by C-section, to a 9 pound 9 once baby boy...  ~ Shane ~  ,  he is soooooo cute...  I spent some alone time with him today after meeting the gastric surgeon.  I did visit my friend but had him in my arms for 3 hours.. Gosh, she is so brave...  her son   ~ Trevor ~   is 7 (8 in sept) and   ~ Jessica ~   is 6 (7 in nov).  They are coming home tomorrow and the girls and I, will decorate the front lawn with blue balloons....  OK first appointment was on Tuesday with a general surgeon.  He is absolutly charming and direct to the point. He also suggested that I keep and see the gastric surgeon to see what my option are about weight loss surgery. Wednesday, the ortho for my broken foot.  It is healing very well, I can't run yet but I can walk a bit better, no crutchs or cane. And today, I met the Gastric Surgeon.  He is the top surgeon for Gastric Bypass in Quebec.  And it ususally take 12 to 20 months to see him.  Well I saw him and he was totally honest.  It is official, I WILL NOT HAVE A GASTRIC BYPASS...  It is to risky for me to have this kind of surgery.  The chances of me have many complicaitons are so much higher than anyone.  Do I want to chance loosing my life...  not.    I now have requested to have the hernias repaired as soon as possible so I can get my life back.  On this my dears, have a great night and...........Be Good

      Well she was lost but now she is found.  I had forgotten to renew my domain... oups....  OK everything is paid up and running back on track.  We just came back from Cobourg, Ontario right on Lake Ontario.  We have been going there for 3 years now and will continu going for as long as it thill stands.  The weather was ok but not great.  We still had fun on the beach, in the lake, shopping, shopping and also a bit of shopping.  hi hi hi.    It was just the 4 of us this time and it was well deserved.  Our Family Unit needed it...  So now I am unpacking and cleaning just to repack on the 8th for our second trip but this time to St-Andrew's by the sea in New Brunswick to see Mom in Law.  The girls are trilled about going there.  And it will be at the same that "Lizzy MacGuire Movie" release.  Guess we will be watching it in the car....  9 hours, need to keep our minds filled with something and shopping requires us to stop....  Not a thing that hubby wants to do, much to my chagrin.  Anyways, will potts around this afternoon and back to soccer tonight.  Looking forward on getting back on track.  Have a good on and.................Be Good

      It's Friday and the start of another weekend...  Started my day by going over to  urlLink  ~ Sandee's ~  to do our new ritual,  our nails.  We are getting to be pro's at it.  If I could post a picture of them, I would.  I have no idea how to post pictures on Blogger... Do You...  We took the kids to see   Spy Kids 3, 3D  ,  so cool.  Kids wore those 3D glasses home.  Yea, I did too...  And boy, did we look smart.  Anyhow, life goes on here and summer is almost at the end.  School starts in 27 days.  I have made my list of school supplies and ready to look for those bargains.  As for me, I cannot wait until the New Year to get my hernias fixed.  I would ideally like to have it done in September and be in tip top shape for the Christmas Time.  There is no way I will go thru the same Christmas has last year.  I guess I will see what the surgeon as to say about that.  On this really breeze night, I say sweet dreams and.............Be Good

      Great sleeping weather  Well the rest of my week went so-so.  I did my pre-op tests on Wednesday and THAT makes it more real.  The fact of me having a third surgery is starting to scares be Bejesussss out of me.  Oh well, such is life.  OK on a much ore important subject...  I love Bob the Bachelor...  He is so adorable.  Can you believe this ladies that go on these shows and get totally drunk, THE FIRST DAY..  Yeah for them... Can they not hold their liquor or what.  Last year you had Amber, who by the way, loves the Olive Garden, totally passed out on someone else's lap. And now, you had BIMBO, swaying and making no sense what so ever.  Gee that is the fastest 15 minutes of fame ever.  What a way to be remembered, drunk or a stacker/wacko/nutso on TV.  I am babbling.  I have a little update about my school.  I told you before that I was taking a course to become a Relaxation Therapist.  I have completed 3 modules and I have 2 modules left.  My grade point average is 88%.  I am soooooooo happy.  I never had so much fun studying.  When I finish, I hope to do something to help others. I have lots of plans and ideas.  Let's start be finishing and getting my diploma.  OK enough said....  One more thing,  please register in my MAP THINGNY....  OK for real, I need to make dinner so have a great Monday evening and ..........Be Good

Yes I sat at my oldest daughter's small (very small) desk and learned about "New Math" so that I can actually stop fighting with Valerie when she does her homework.  One question to all the teachers out there..... WHY....  Yes I know, you read from the left to the right and you should calculate the same way...  It is so stupid and longer..  I know, it shows the kids the WHY of calculating.  It is just longer.  Anyways, tomorrow, my girls have no school.  So in the morning, they will do their homework  and I will do my stuff for  urlLink   ~Sandee's, A Breast Cancer Walk to Remember 2003 , this Sunday ~    I am so happy to help her this year.

The girls started school this week.  Only 2 half days, but still, schools back....   They even took the bus this year and like a new School Bus Mom,  I drove to school to check that they got there in one piece and not crying for me... Like As If...  My oldest was not impressed with my surprise visit..   Mom, you can't do that...It is not cool....    At least my baby was happy to see me...  I will get HER a nice car when she turns 21....  hi hi hi....   Anyways,  I will turn in now and catch you on the flip side so I am sending you big virtual hugs and kisses.......Be Good  p.s.

      I am here.... 6 pounds lighter  Hi Everyone.  It has been quite a ride lately.  I have been baking, cooking, cleaning and bitching.   Last Sunday, we went apple picking at  urlLink  ~ Quinn Farm ~ , near our home.  We picked 2 big bags.  I made a batch of homemade applesauce for the teacher's gift at Christmas and I will make Apple Pies this weekend for the family.  The house smells soooo nice when you cook apples. I also made 24 carrot/walnut muffins but none for the freezer.  Betty Crocker Move over...  So my freezers is filled with Macaroni Gratin and apple sauce.  The laundry is updated.  Halloween decorations are up and running and Christmas decoration are up next, neatly arrange by box number..  OK I have lost it.  I started the  urlLink  ~ The Sacred Heart Diet ~  since Monday and I have lost 6 pounds doing it.  It is a recommended diet for obese patients before surgery.  On this site you can find all kinds of diets.  I am, for the first time in my life, really sticking with it.  I feel great.  I could loose up to 17 pounds by Sunday.  Even if I loose another 5, I will be trilled.  I will also do it next week.  The more pounds off before my surgery, the better it is.  OK Let's talk BOB....  What is up with Lee-Ann,   we know who the sicko is....  I vote for Meredith.  She has class and poise and she is beautiful.  But I am very unhappy with how they cut out the rose ceremony this week, that sucks.   Mom came over yesterday so we can celebrate her birthday.  We went to see   urlLink  ~ Under the Tuscan Sun ~.   Where can I get a sexy Italian Guy...  Oops already had one,  humm  still remember it too....  It is true what they say about Italian Men...     Ok enough of this...I miss my online and offline friends lately...    Have a great Thursday and..............Be Good

Her voice cracking she told me that her mother in law passed away that morning.  Monty is devastated. He also  buried his Dad 2 years ago.  I just came back from the Temple.  My emotions are running very high.  She was 67 years old.  Again, way too young to go.    Everyday of our lives should be live to its fullest.  Some day we will regret not speaking or hugging or even laughing with someone.  Life on this hearth is so very short.  On this very rainy Friday.............Be Good  urlLink

        ~ Another Sad Day ~    I told Alex on Saturday that he should call his grandparents and older relatives, and after diner that night, we get a call that his ~ Auntie Tina ~ passed away that morning.  She lived a full life.  She was 85.  She was the oldest girls of 8 kids.  Her mom passed away when her youngest brother was born.  She was 11.  She took over has "Mom" to her family until her dad past away at age 101.  She was a terrific lady.  She actually was the first person I meet in Alex's family.  He has a very special bond with her.  Unfortunately men have a hard time with these types of feelings.  Well that is the circle of life... Sometimes it just takes us by surprise when the age is so young.  Everyone should live the best way they can and remember that we are only here for a short time.  Have a good Monday night and...................God Bless and Be Good

Back in 1986, I was a travel escort and traveled to China, so her outfit is THE REAL THING. And  urlLink  Melanie   went back to the 60's.  Groovy...........  I am not a very big fan of Vampires, witches and devils.  On my side, I went to my surgeon to get my staples (all 37 of them) removed.  It was funny because I STILL have no feeling on my skin.  Tomorrow I go back to get the stiches removed.  I have my moments.  The mornings are so hard because I can't sleep on my tummy and at night, well, I have my day to hurt me.  So on this, I miss my friends lots and ................Be Good  I know that my pictures are really bad quality, I still have no idea how to fix it yet.   *&_(*^^%$ My comment thingny is on the fritz again

        ~ Only 2 more days... And than the BIG 4-0... ~    When I was a little girl, I thought 30 was sooo old and being 40, you had to be a grandparent.  Now I find myself, a couple of days away of being that old....  My youngest Melanie asked me a few days ago, how to spell 60... I asked her why and she said, Mom it's  for your birthday.... Now That Is Depressing...  I do feel like a 60 years old today.  Our Christmas was amazing.  Mom slept over.  Always a treat for us.  We went to our Church for a candlelight service on the 24th and on Christmas Morning, the girls where up at 6:15am but knew that 7:30am was the time to have Mom & Dad up....  We all got spoiled by Santa. My brother Mike and his wife Marthe and their kids Anthony and Rachel came by in the afternoon for dinner.    We had a ball.  It was so nice to relax, enjoy ourselves and just be merry.  A bit too much of drinking but still, lots of fun.  So now we are just taking it easy for a few days and playing with all of our Christmas Toys.  On this Beautiful Sunny Saturday Morning, have a great day and............Be Good

When my day was crappy, she made it better,   Thanks sweetie, I love it, it brightens my day, everyday.   Why did I choose this,  well my friend urlLink  ~ Lori ~  and I have great ideas that include Scrapbooking.  This is not very popular in Montreal yet and we have such amazing craft ideas.  Right now, we can't really talk about them because some of these ideas will be a first its kind.  But when everything is said and done, you know.  We will have a web site, that hopefully  urlLink  ~ Sandee ~ can design for us... So ALL of us can make of few extra dollars.  Anyways, in the mean time, we are having a blast researching this.

        ~ Spent time in the hospital today ~    Melanie had been vomiting since yesterday.  Everything.  This morning, she looked so awful that I took her to the emergency.  She was a bit dehydrated.  They got her on a IV for 3 hours and took blood.  We didn't stay for the blood result to come back. We would still be there.  After 4 hours there, she looked and felt much better, she even kept her ice chips.   Yeaaaaaaa..  So we got back home and I went for a little nap...  3 hours later...Here I am now.  So on this Saturday evening, I am pooped........Be Good

        ~ Just writing to relieve pain ~    My life sucks.  Don't get me wrong.  I love my kids but I feel like such a failure these days.  I had a bad time at Christmas.  This house is filled with so much stress and anger.  I am realizing that when a friend in need IS NOT a friend indeed.  And that goes for family too...  They see right past you.  It sucks.  I also should of been there for a friend from church, who like me, has been battling depression for a while.  I saw her just before Christmas but didn't catch on.  She took her life this past week.  I feel like I should of listened or called her.  Anyways, life sucks........Sorry

        ~ I once was lost and now I am found ~    Ok for those of you that don't know these words... They are from "Amazing Grace", one of my favorite hymn/song.  When you listen to the words, they actually get inside your skin and stir up your soul.  Well I am not in a good place and it's been a quite a while.  I am feeling pulled down and down and can't seem to get out of it.    I chatted with an old friend today and he, again, put a smile on my face.  It has been a long time since I giggled out loud.    Thanks Buddy, you are very special to me..  Keep being my friend    Anyways, I will check in my bed now and hope for a better tomorrow so..........Be Good

        ~ EMOTIONS ~    On Friday evening, I went to see  urlLink  The Passion of Christ  .  What can I say...  What a movie... Yes it is very graphic but what a movie... Mel Gibson did good with this and He is in the movie.  He hold the nail because he says   He died because of me for me so I feel that it is important to do it  .  As most of you know, I became a Christian 4 years ago.  I never knew that I could have a relationship with God.  He has Blessed me in lots of way and sometimes I forget.  But watching this touching and moving story, refreshed and re-confirmes my faith.  The emotions that His Mother must of went thru was so well depicted, it tore us up.  Mom came with me to see and both her and I came out of there shaken.  It is incredible that a movie about a book that had been around forever, would make such an impact with ALL religious groups.  IT LOOKS LIKE A REVIVAL....  And I am ready.  On this Sunday morning, off to church so ............Be Good and God Bless \o/

        ~ Never Say Never ~    I have dealt with depression and all it's forms throughout my life.  When I finally broke down and went thru a severe depression, I had people around me, saying,   It is all in your head or Only weak people have a burn-outs  ...  Let's face the facts...  First of all.. Burn-Out is a yuppie way of saying Depression... Second of all, weak people don't have depression, they just feel like they do ALL THE TIME.  The ones that are strong are the ones that fall the hardest... Trust me..   Because when you are in it,  you basically tell yourself that YOU ARE OK,  first mistake..  Talk to yourself and listen to our loved ones... They see the side that you try to hide (very badly) and can get you help.  Let yourself be open to suggestions and helping hands.    All this to tell you that,  2 of these people, the ones that couldn't understand about depression, are actually in one and are off work and on meds and are in a bad way.  I wish my friends would  listen to advise and not dismiss it.    At Christmas, our church family lost a great lady to depression and it's very dark side.  She & I use to talk often and I am still, today, so upset that she couldn't find help.  And yes I feel like I could of help.  So on this, listen to your body, stop and breath more often.  Talk to friends, doctors and even to your diary.  If you are not OK, you can't take care of anyone.  OK enough, take care everyone and......... Be Good

        ~ Quick Update ~    Mom had her surgery on Wednesday.  It took 2 extra hours to do.  My emotions are already very sensitive, imaging now.  Dr. McLeod did an amazing job, again. He is the one I had for my last surgery in October.  Anyway, she is very "Morphined - up"  and pooped.  Day by day... That is the only way to heal and get her strenght back.  Sitting in the waiting room, I realized how alone I was...  I basically was alone from 9am until 2pm when they wheeled her out...  Where are all the people that are suppose to be my friends and family... Don't get me wrong, I have lots of friends and these friends ( and family members ) have there own things going on, but when you need support, they basically are not around.  Makes me very sad to feel this way... I can't beging to express my sadness..    urlLink  ~ Sue ~  thank you for your good wishes...  It means a lot to me...  Got to go ,  have a great weekend.  I am off for a while, I have had it... Be Good

        ~ Back from Heaven ~    What a wonderful weekend.  Mom and I went to  urlLink  ~ Mont-Tremblant ~   for a weekend of SPA-rific treatments.  The  urlLink  ~ Spa Sur Le Lac ~  was so amazing.  We started on Saturday with some. urlLink  ~ Reflexology ~  and than some nap-time, because THAT is soooo tiring.. and in the evening we go dressed up and went for a YUMMY diner with Champagne.  After a great night sleep, an afternoon of more treats for our body's.  We basically didn't want to come back.  Mom & I always have a great time together.  I am so fortunate to have my Best Friend in my mom.  Again, we laughed so much that my insides hurt.  I will tell you a little secret, no one in the dining room was having as much fun as we were...   After a beautiful weekend, came back to my "Petite Famille".  I did miss them..  So now back to work and still feeling the after math of a great weekend.  Have a sunny filled day and.........Be Good

        ~ Easter Bunny gave me a head-cold ~    What a wonderful weekend.  Marthe and Mike make us feel so welcomed each and every time.  The girls had so much fun with the cousins.  It is always hard when we leave. It makes us sad to think that just to pop in would be a 5 hour drive.    We went to their church on Sunday.  It is called  urlLink  The Meeting House   and it is very differente.  It is also Christian but without borders. It is a church for people who hate churches.  It was still a great "Cool" service.  The theme for Sunday was the '60s... Yes, the Pastor wore sandals, jeans and a tie-dye top, but he does wear that every Sunday.  There was dry ice (smoke machines) during the praising and really funky colors thru out the service.  It was groovy.  His message was still heard no matter what.  He Has Risen, no matter where you were.  So now I am at home, Tylenol in hand with a chaser of Orange Juice.  The girls are next door watching a Tween movie and I will try to nap for a little hour or so.  So on this rainy, yucky, flannel nighty kind of day....... Be Good...atchoo

        ~ Where does the time go ~    I can't believe that it is almost Friday...  I am here to wish all my on and off line friends a very Happy Easter and Happy Passover.  My family and I are going to Toronto for 3 days, at my brother Mike.  Mom will be joining us.  We will have a great time, like usual.  Marthe, my sister-in-law, is an amazing host and cook.  She is so organized and runs her house with perfection.  So until I see you again,  take a moment and reflect about why we celebrate this AWESOME Holiday... Here is a hint, it has nothing to do with bunnies and Chocolates...  If you need a hint.... Read  ~ John 3:16 ~ in a bible.  So on this ...........Be Good and God Bless \o/

       Spend all your time waiting  for that second chance,  for a break that would make it okay.   There's always some reason  to feel not good enough,  and it's hard, at the end of the day.   I need some distraction,  Oh, beautiful release.  Memories seep from my veins.   Let me be empty,  Oh, and weightless,  And maybe I'll find some peace tonight.    Sarah McLachlan     Thats how I feel, first i will be happy then I will feel guilty that ive done something wrong and that everything is my fault...its something i just cannot help. i just have this horrible feeling that i dont deserve to be living. Have you all ever felt that way? That everything you do is wrong and you think you arent normal? Just because you arent the prettiest or arent as skinny as some people you see? Do you ever ask god "Why couldnt you just make everything and everyone beautiful"?      "I'm so tired but I can't sleep  Standin' on the edge of something much to deep  It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word  We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard   But I will remember you, will you remember me?  Don't let your life pass you by  Weep not for the memories"     Sarah McLachlan    Dear God  Hope you got the letter and...  I pray you can make it better down here  I don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer  But all the people that you made in your image  See them starving on their feet  Cause they don't get enough to eat  From God  I can't believe in you  Dear God  Sorry to disturb you but...  I feel that I should be hear loud and clear  We all need a big reduction  In the amount of tears  And all the people that you made in your image  See them fighting in the street  Cause they can't make opinions meet about God  I can't believe in you  Did you make disease  and the diamond blue?  Did you make mankind  after we made you?  And the devil too?  Dear God,  Don't know if you noticed but...  Your name is on a lot of quotes in this book  And as crazy humans wrote it  you should take a look  And all the people that you made in your image  Still believeing that junk is true  Well I know it ain't and so do you, dear God  I can't believe in  I don't believe in  I won't believe in heaven and hell  no saints no sinners no devil as well  no pearly gate no thorny crown  you're always letting us humans down  the wars you bring  the babes you drown  those lost at sea and never found  and it's all the same the whole world round  the hurt I see helps to compound  That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost  is just somebody's unholy hoax  And if you're up there you'd perceive  That my heart's here upon my sleeve  If there's one thing I don't believe in...  It's you, dear God.    Sarah McLachlan

Today was NOT so swell, i got a teacher yelling at me *a guy* for something I didnt even do and he didnt even give me time to explain, he just told me to shut my mouth and talk to him after class, which made me look bad!!!!! Then i told him it wasnt me but he said i have had a bad attitude problem, lets wonder why! :/ No track today, too cold.    LOL Thanks sandee, you really gave me a traffic boost!!!  I didnt think anyone really noticed that i left for a bit. ;) Im really glad about ur results!! I Love You!

      Well its 7 pm and I just got back! Our choir did Great!!! We got two 1's, which is the best rating, 1 for the stage performace, and another 1 for our sightreading, and if you dont know what that is, its where you get a random peace of music and u have to say each note like "do re mi" and stuff and its in different key sometimes! But my day was agony! I didnt know we werent supposed to wear sneakers and of course i did and so i had to call my mom but she wasnt home and so my vocal teacher gave me some shoes that were 2 sizes to small! They were 8 and a halfs, i wear 10! OMG my feet hurt SOOOOO BAD!!!!! Yeah well, today is Fat tuesday and i sure took advantage of that, i ate too much, like no other. For some reason right now I dont feel very happy, reasons i dont know. Maybe its because i havent taken my meds in awhile. I keep forgetting, yeah. Well not much else, im tired. Have a nice day.

      "All The Things She Said" By Tatu  All the things she said All the things she said Running through my head All the things she said All the things she said Running through my head  This is not enough   I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost If I'm asking for help it's only because Being with you has opened my eyes Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?  I keep asking myself, wondering how I keep closing my eyes but I can't block you out Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me Nobody else so we can be free   All the things she said All the things she said Running through my head All the things she said All the things she said Running through my head  This is not enough This is not enough  All the things she said All the things she said  And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed They say it's my fault but I want her so much Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain Come in over my face, wash away all the shame When they stop and stare - don't worry me 'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me I can try to pretend, I can try to forget But it's driving me mad, going out of my head  Mother looking at me Tell me what do you see? Yes, I've lost my mind  Daddy looking at me Will I ever be free? Have I crossed the line?

      OHHHH goody things got so much better!!! NOT!!!!  I come home and call my dad back because my mom said he had called and then he was like "well i just want to let you know that you can keep the valentine because the fact that it took over 2 weeks to get it to me means u must not give a damn about me" well damn that u bitch!!!!! THE FACT THAT WE FUCKING GOT YOU SOMETHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH, U DONT LIKE IT?! SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS!!!! then i hang up on him, he decides to call back  then it gets good  I tell my mom to pick it up and he askes for me again and i say "mom no im not talking to him" and she told me that he was fine, so i talked to him and HE HAS THE NERVE TO TELL ME "IF YOU EVER HANG UP ON ME AGAIN...BLAH BLAH" im crying by that time and i yell at him back saying "OKAY WELL U HUNG UP ON ME 1ST SO I HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE MAD AND IT WASNT EVEN MY FAULT AMANDA DIDNT GIVE U THE VALENTINE" ohhh yall are probably laughing by now...the ass gets mad over a goddamn valentine...surprise surprise!!! So as my dad is still bitching at me i shove the phone at my mom and run away crying because i was so pissed and am still so pissed for what he did, then my divorced parents started yelling at each other and my dad decides that hes not gonna yell at amanda, but that hes going to yell at me! ME!!! FUCK!!!!!!!!!! i hope he reads this because he has no idea how mad i am at him and maybe i shouldnt give a rats ass about him because he shoulda been happy that we even fucking got him something, if hes gonna get all bitchy over some fucking chocolates then he can just screw off. sorry but im sooo not kidding, just because parents are well..adults *sometimes immature i might add* i have all the right to do the kicking and screaming shit too.   Then he goes "You can keep the chocolates and eat them" haha u know what...i feel like putting that peice of shit down the garbage disposal..the end of my crappy pathetic, shitty ass life....I HOPE YOU HAVE ENJOYED!!!!

      Is it just me or do I cry to easily or what???  Um yeah okay, my dad calls asking me what his valentine looked like and i described it to him and he told me my oldest sister, amanda, ate it, which I am so not surprised for...then my dad decides to hang up on me with his last words of "Thanks a lot for nothing" i started bawling right that second considering i dont know what i did or said that was so horrible. This is was pisses me off half the time. Did i Eat them?! NO i was only doing what my dad asked me too was telling him what we got him for valentines, which my sister said he got it but he said he didnt get it, and im so confused and sad, and i dont know!!!   just got off the phone with my sister, apprently she still does have the valentine, but then why was the thing my dad found the exact thing with the exact stuff in it? what the f*ck!

      Today was amazing in so many ways, and yet also emotional too. We had a family dinner with Mom, Dad, Aunt Susanna, Grandma and Grandpa, Jason, sis amanda, and cousin Jenna. We went out to eat at  Pearls Lakeside  on Lake Hefner. I havent been really eating much lately so I got a salad and  TRIED A CLAM  sick!! the slimy stuff looks so  interesting.  I kept asking dad what the slimy stuff would be if it was alive but he wouldnt really explain really well so I was like whatever. Jenna is eight and likes everything accept for pizza!! she is quite a character and I love her so much. This is my 3rd time only to see her though sadly. I missed her growing up. When I was eight I saw her when she was only one and I saw her last aug when she was seven and now this aug when she was eight. I really wished I was there when she was gorwing up a bit because before I know it she will be my age because time is moving quickly now and its not gonna stop anytime soon.  My dad's fioncee, becki did not come because if she did, then mom would not because she thinks its not "appropriate". And its moms side thats here so I really wanted her to be here but i wanted becki to be here to meet them too. Its not fair and it makes me so mad.  Then it got emotional. I was actually happy to all be together, but I was also sad at the same time. My mom and dad were there! together like nothing happened; like they werent even divorced. It made me so sad to think that even though we are all family, as a whole we really arent. after dinner I asked my dad to take me onto the lake to see the sunset.  It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life. I wish life itself was that beautiful..I wish it was all happiness..the colors, everything about it makes me happy. I want a boat so I can just sail away on lake hefner. I saw ducks too. it was nice. When me and my dad were out there he asked me what I thought and I said it was kind of weird and he asked me how so and before i told him i told him i would cry and i completely broke down and told him i wish sometimes him and mom were back together and he told me he was sorry and said some other things that i dont quite remmeber. I was so nervous for tonight because my mom was having family problems in the passed and i was so upset and stressed i had breathing problems and i got my period all over again. GRRR!!!!!!  Well tomorrow is my sisters wedding at 10 am. It will be exciting although i will probably have some axiety attack because walking down an isle with people watching kind of freaks me out. but I guess we will see how it goes. hmph.  my family leaves sunday back to new jersey. I will miss them but I hope my real side will come out of me these last few days with them because i just feel so guilty and sad that i have been sad but i cant really help it sometimes. I just want someone to understand me and wont get upset and be like "god she always crys and is sad".

      I was just reading all my old entries from 2003 on here and Ive realized I have changed in many ways since Andrea died. She made me so happy and I guess now, a part of the happiness I had when she was alive is gone. I used to be so funny and now im..not. I wish this didnt happen but I cant help it and I wish my funniness would come back. But then again some of it could just be me changing because i am getting older...I had just turned 14 when i wrote those and im about to turn 16 in 3 months. hmm  My sisters wedding is in 4 days. All the family is coming down from NJ and im so happy...  Janet, do you read this? I hate talking to myself lol
