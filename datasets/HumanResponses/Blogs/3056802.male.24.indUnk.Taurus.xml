       Ever notice how stupid people are?   I work for a company that save people money... seriously, we cut communication costs, and take a part of the savings, therefore still saving them some money.  I call people on a daily basis that just don't want to save money. Apparently it's so abundant out there (money that is) that people don't want to store some away for a rainy day. they'd rather just piss it against a wall and bitch about how expensive shit is. Fucking dumb... yes I swear a lot... puck off... (better?).  Add to the fact that I'm convince 9 out of 10 "manager's" out there are fucking computer illiterate.  Ever been asked the question what's that cool program you're using to have to respond with the answer of "Microsoft Excel".  IT"S FUCKING EXCEL...  Who the fuck doesn't know what excel is in the year 2004. GET A CLUE.  AND...  How many of you people out there have a fucking swear jar in your office.  Oh and for all those bible thumbing god lovers out there, I understand your religion is important, but don't push it onto me, and relegate Christ (the Lord's name) as a swear.. seriously, think about it, when someone utters the lords name... not taken in vain, it's calling the lord, isn't that ackowledging him, which is what he wants, and even if it is in vain, it's a staple of society, people have been conditioned to use the word in that manner and not mean it the way Jesus boy in the corner is taking it... STOP REPRESSING FREE SPEECH.  FUCK.   Oh and check out this website.. freaking cool...  urlLink PixelRanger

        Friendship in all forms.    You never fully realise the greatness of people until you leave them, then come back and realise how much they mean, or how little.&nbsp; When you think of someone you think of their qualities, when sometimes a person's presence is the most cherished thing, being around them, enjoying who they are, and what they are.  I love being around the people I currently have in my life, as they are truly wonderful people, and a few are the best things to ever happen in my short existance, without them, I don't know if I would be the person I am today, and even though my past month has been one of questionable greatness, without them, I don't think I would of survived.&nbsp; I love my friends, and I love my Friend even more, she has so much to offer it astounds me on a daily basis.  Cherish the people who care for you, that make your day better, because without them, your days might not be as great, or as fulfilling, I can guarantee that.  And with that I hit the hay, with dreams and wonder filling my little head

        A World of Unsureties       &nbsp;  Surrounded by people, that love you, that care for you, that want to make sure you are okay, when you are faced with adversaries, whether mental or physical you stick them out.&nbsp; You face them head on and you tangle them blow for blow.    &nbsp;  I've tried convincing myself and others to follow what you think is the best course of action, unless you run... to date i've stood by my decisions and backed them 100% never giving up, fighting the good fight, wanting what's best for myself and others.    &nbsp;  NEVER RUN... or you just end up regretting what you left... trust me, i've tried it and it doesn't work.    &nbsp;  I Love You Shannon, don't run from this...    &nbsp;  You wanted something less cryptic... this is it right here... straight as a fucking arrow... don't fucking run.    &nbsp;  JB out for the night

        A Life of Consequences and Rememberance...       &nbsp;  Well life has been interesting, I'll give ya that.. events occur and we as human beings adapt and evolve to meet the circumstances and to overcome them.&nbsp; We as human being have an amazing ability to adapt to any situation, and to take what life throws our way and battle it blow for blow.    &nbsp;  Have you ever been in love... the true love, where you care for someone more than you do yourself, where you want only the best in life for that person, you strive to achieve more for them, than for you on occassion...&nbsp; That is the love i'm facing right now, and it is the highest intoxication available to the human race, drugs hold no candle to this.    &nbsp;  It was pointed out to me today by a woman, that everything I stand for, who I am, to the core of my being is one of the most honourable and noble things a person can be.&nbsp; This woman doubted my intentions as most people do, thinking I am only out to gain the best for myself, as most of the human race does, and to be honest I think that is so disheartening.    &nbsp;  When you are like myself, you strive to make others happy, and hopefully in turn you become happy yourself, knowing that you've enriched people lives somewhat or fully.    &nbsp;  I believe I did that for a person, and because of that I was in my element, I loved her, I loved seeing her become more, learn, try new things, overcome past fears, and to be there for her as someone she could truly rely upon... I did not cheat, I did not lie to her, I treated her as I wish I could be treated.    &nbsp;  Now because of someone that is deceitful, someone that wants only what he can get and not think of the consequences or how many people he hurts, everything I am, everything I stand for, and everything I can offer this person, appears to be slowly but surely dismissed.    &nbsp;  I stand on a precipice waiting for a sign that good will triumph, that logic and emotion will fight the war and bring the person back to me, so I can enrich her life again, fulfill her every dream, and pull her back from the blackness that envelopes the door she is about to step through.    &nbsp;  I love life and who I am, and the person I am, and wish to share that with that person...    &nbsp;  I can only hope and dream for once something will go right.. and I'm not talking about just me..    &nbsp;  Much love...

       Dark Encumberance   Do you ever question things...  Wonder why they happen, or wonder why it happens to you.  Is life supposed to be dealt with by yourself or with your friends by your side.  Do you face everything head first or hiding behind the door, hoping it would go away...  Questions without answers... I think so...  Today's quote of the blog...  "Everyone has a breaking point... where's yours"  Night,  Brett

       Dreams of insubstantial substance.   The age old myth... you see a rainbow, is there really a pot of gold at the end of it... with a leprechaun waiting to give you untold amounts of gold.  Based on Science, which mostly my life is, you would say no, and that the rainbow is merely an illusion, created by the sun bouncing off water particles, and being refracted at just the right angle.  Based on the myth you would already be trying to reach the end of the rainbow, and you wouldn't be reading this.  The question boils down to... do you think scientifically or mythically... do you go on blind faith, or think things through, or a combination of both.  Today's quote of the blog...  "When you search a soul, you may find what you want to know, but when time searches a soul love may flourish"  Until next time...  I wish you happy dreams and a life of wonder.  Brett

      Songs are amazing, able to convey so much emotion in on average 4 minutes.  Love, Fear, Hate, Happiness, Elation, Wonder, Indifference... Truth.  Some of the people are truly artists, no canvas, no paint brush, simple words.  Simple feelings.  All there is to say...  Brett

       A Night of Pizza   By now, any that read this know I'm a pizza delivery guy... not the worlds most exciting job, but it helps to pay the bills.  It's easy work, and not too hard mentally.. (read: simple as hell) but hey I enjoy it.  I drive around. and get to see all the things going on in Peterborough, and seriously... it's not a bad town, we have web sites dedicated to how much it sucks, and they do have their points, I can't deny them that, but generally there are some fairly nice people in town.  Rambling on... when you reach a low point, and you realise that low point, think to yourself... about everything good in your life, everything that makes sense, and makes you happy, and reach out for it, don't dwell in the valley that you are in, because if you do, you stay there, and no one wants to be forever depressed, and if you do, that makes no sense.  I've stated before that my life as of the past couple of weeks hasn't been the best, I've realised this, and I think tonight, being Wednesday, July the 8th, 2004 is a turning point.  I can survive and I can prosper, I can move on for the negative points in my life, and just learn to cherish all the good things that I have already surrounding me,  If it isn't the best, it's at least fairly decent.  Appreciate life to the fullest. For lack of a better saying.  for the Quote of the blog today may I present...  "When all is said and done, i'll just be a warm feeling in the back of your memory."  It doesn't really mean much, but I think it's neat...  Sleep well fellow bloggers... your trusty writing companion...  Brett

       A night at the movies   Well I watched Bad Santa tonight, it's not bad, hawever I've got to say that the best thing about the movie is this quote.  Little Boy - "Santa why is you beard falling off" Santa      - "Because I slept with a woman that wasn't clean"  It's amazing what they can put in movies today, some of the shit is just twisted. only hting to say.  ----------  On a different note, ever notice the little things...  When a touch can mean so much to you, when a look can cause a flutter, when a presence can seem like the room is full, the little things in life are to be appreciated, cherished, sought after, and held for an eternity in your mind, for those little things are the things that make life worth living. Make each breath you have and each look you give or receive a wonderous thing.  I'm happy i'm writing again, It's been too long since I wrote.  for the second quote of the blog today, may I present...  "Never frown.....because you never know who's falling in love with your smile...."  Sleep well people...  Brett

       Cold Doctor Hands   I love it when you goto a doctor, and you have to get "examined"lots of fun... especially when they start prodding and poking around in places that you think are reserved for that "special someone."  I'm sorry it's unnerving... and I don't think that I've ever sweated that much before in my life. Literally it was like niagra falls had opened under my armpits.  However there are good things to it... you find out yure well, there is no problem with the plumbing, you're good to go and get a grade A sticker slapped on yure ass and out you wander.  Speaking of grade A, ever feel like a piece of meat when they're doing their doctor thing. EUGH... unnerving.  Secondly I'd like to inform you all that peterborough hosted the 2004 special olympics (or I think we did, is it over yet?), and that was great w00t for us.  However if it is over I think all they did was move from the olympic venue to bus station.  I live across from the bus station, and currently don't have any curtains on my windows, so I get to see all the "special" people wandering around down there, and seriously I think they get dumber and more retarded on a daily basis.  Only would a pregnant mother with 2 small kids trailing her, and one on her back, miss the bus, because she refuses to give up her smoke.  Now you may think I'm bullshitting you on this, but I can promise you I am not.  I'm retarded on occassion, but not fucked up enough to come up with a situation like that.  Only in Petey, boys n girls...  Finally I come to the part I love the most... The wonders of Brett and my life... I'm doing better and getting better on a daily basis, Life's too short to screw up all the time.. ever notice that, and when shit gets you down, there's no point letting it keep you there.  Today's quote of the blog I picked up in my travels, and and believe it in it's entirety.  Read on...  "Love is friendship set on fire!"  And on that note we end today's ramblings once more...  Your faithful blogger (it's the trusth I swear it)  Brett

       A New Life, A New Leaf   Well boys n girls, looks like this blog is gonna start kicking again, lots of stuff to put down, all with little to no importance... that's how it's sposed to be right.  I will on occassion put stuff up that warrants some merit on occassion though.  Cuz I can.. and don't argue.  Well I've got the new apartment, and fuck me is she clean now, I mean, I don't think this thing has ever been this clean... I'm a cleaning machine.  Trying to get a kitty to share my space with... yeah it's gonna take some time... but I have all the faith in the world in me. and the poor potential animal that gets to share my screwed up sleeping habits with.  I'm single now... much to my disgust, but still in love with the girl, however she needs her space and I respect that, and respect her even more, albeit some would question my decisions.  Whoever said I was normal, come to think of it I don't think anyone ever has, but hey that's a good thing right.  I'm living life and trying to look at things in a whole new way... slowly but surely we all progress.  For todays quote of the blog I submit to you with humble sincerity and love the following, intended for that one person out there, that may or may not read this...  "If I could be anything, I would be your tear so I could be born in your eye, live down your cheek, and die on your lips"  Much Love to you all...  Brett

       Loving the Dream     What is the greatest thing in life... that is a question many people wish to know the answer to, and for every person out there I believe it is different.  If you find something beyond reasonable greatness, and realise it and accept it, do you take it at face value and just appreciate it on a daily basis, or do you do what human nature dictates and question when it'll all be over.  When will it end, and will you be left without the wonder that that thing brought you?  Adjustment is a thing every person is capable of, but should people adjust all the time, when does it become too painful to adjust, or to change.  Are we all capable of change, the little things yes, but the big things... when there is a problem that will affect your life for the remainder of it, can something HUGE change, can something be done to solve the problem.  I think whether mentally or physically it's possible, however I may be wrong.  Please god don't let me be wrong... I don't think I can take much more of things going wrong...  Ciao...  Jungle Bunny Love
