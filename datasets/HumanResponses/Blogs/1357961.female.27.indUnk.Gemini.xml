      my apologies for the lack in posting lately. My wonderful Dell laptop finally shit. Well, not really, it is just in the shop having the keyboard replaced due to a mishap with a couple of Kendall's last summer: 1. A glass of Kendall Jackson spilled all over the keyboard, and 2. Kendall the dog pissing all over the computer while I was packing for Cali. (I guess I should have taken that as a sign.) Anyway, the keyboard is finally being replaced a year later. you should have seen the dude's face when I told him all that it had been through. later he called me and told me my computer had contracted 4 viruses. that ho. so in the meantime, i am internet-less. which hasn't been that bad. is it me, or is the world of blogging not what it used to be. it used to be fun, and now people are dropping like flies and shit. i don't know. maybe they have all gone on and gotten lives and i am just one sick, sad, sorry, unemployed fuck.  well my gainfully unemployed ass is going to go soak up what is left of the sun. peace.

      "Yes, you see love is not something that happens to you, it is something you do. So what didn't I do?" ~Bridget Jones, The Edge of Reason  As much as I would love to love someone, I feel I am thoroughly incapable of it right now. I am inventing my own little world, getting into the groove of the single thing. To add another person to my life right now would just mess up my equilibrium. I am drama free, worry free, just free. No wondering, "Is he going to call", and if he does call "what am i going to say!?!" No worries.   Don't get me wrong. There are things that I miss. I mean, I like a penis as much as the next guy, but the hassle and drama that comes along with said appendage is just not worth it to me right now.   While still in it's developmental stages, the master Monkey Butt plan includes no room for another person. If someone comes along and wants to be part of my world for a little while, that is cool. But I am not going to reshape my life for another person ever again. It's just not my style. ;)

       Number of jobs I've had since returning to New York: 2. Number of jobs I've left since returning to New York: 2. Number of jobs I have right now: 0. Weight lifted off of my shoulders since leaving said jobs: A ton.     I am unemployed. Again. I have had it with the fat Nazi ho that berates me every day, and pokes me in the back to make her point. I don't understand what I have ever done to the bitch, but she was gunning for me big time. I would have been fired anyway, so I am not worried about a reference. I guess I will be working for my dad in the meantime. I just wish I could pinpoint exactly what it is I was meant for. It seems like everyone around me has found their niche, and I just can't seem to settle on one thing.   Well, time to go begin the job search again...

      Tonight, I had my first taste of yokel, er I mean  local  politics. I figured that since I am probably going to stay in Craphole for a while, I should get involved. Especially since my father owns a large business in the town- a business that one day my brother and I will be running together (that is if we don't kill each other). It is time for me to make a name for myself here, as a force to be reckoned with if any yuppies come in and try to destroy all that my family has built over the years. My brother has no interest in politics, and while he is an intelligent kid, has no sense of diplomacy. If it were left up to him, he would tell you to go fuck yourself, and barricade the place with snipers and surround it with land mines. I, on the other hand, will tell you to go fuck yourself with a smile on my face.  Seriously though. I need these people to understand that I am not just Mr. Monkey Butt's flighty daughter. I am an adult now, and as much as I don't want to accept that, i think it is time to step up, because nobody else is going to.   So the meeting was very brief, and a tad boring, but we came out smelling like roses. It wasn't much of a battle this time, but I plan to continue my presence at the meetings.   I am developing another elaborate scheme for my future, but like the weather here in Craphole, that could change with the day....

      so here i am.... moved again. just call me a blogger gypsy. I just felt i needed to start over, stop bitching, snap out of my woe-is- me routine and snap back into my relentlessly evil and vulgar (with a touch of sweetness) self.  ;)  I still have no idea what I want. just when i think i have a plan, I change my mind. and then i want to run- convinced that the answers lie somewhere in a bay sunrise or a bayou breeze. or maybe at the bottom of the margarita bucket. but of course, they don't, and at the risk of sounding like a total cheesy ass cliche, the answers lie in me. I just want to wake up in the morning not knowing what the day will bring. Where a smile can change your world, or silence could break it. I don't want to live vicariously through others- I Want others to live vicariously through me. I want to be surrounded by love and adventure, music and intrigue. I want sunshine, I want to dance. I want simplicity, I want beauty.   Is that too much to ask?

       "Sorry I'm not home right nowI'm walking into spiderwebs- so leave a message and I'll call you back- a likely story, but leave a message and I'll call you back..." ~no doubt~   Well, all you animal freaks will be happy to know that Merry and Pippin have found homes. Not together, as I had hopes, but they both went to loving homes and are sure to be well cared for. I didn't take them to the shelter, I actually took them to the produce stand and hung out with them all day preying on yuppie sympathy. It worked. I was pretty surprised, as I thought it would take me a few days before someone was interested. In a way I am glad they have found a home, but I couldn't help but feel a little sad when Pippin went. (He was my favorite, and the last to go). In the end though, I am not a cat person. After changing two nasty litter boxes, I remembered the #1 reason I prefer dogs: They do not poop in your house. (Unless you feed them Peanut Butter Scooby snacks, but I digress). But anyway, animals are animals, and I love them all.  I actually am beginning to think that I care for animals more than I do people. It pisses me off to no end that people can be so heartless and throw an animal to the side of the road. To have that little respect for a living creature that didn't ask to be brought in to this world, and is hopeless to defend itself against it's harsh reality. Yeah, I may be a tad over-dramatic, but that's how i feel. Simply put, some people are terds. But Merry and Pippin are now safe, happy, and loved.  Speaking of people being terds, I am not exempt from this generalization. I recieved numerous phone calls yesterday from the married (divorced?) dude from the  urlLink Saratoga trip . We were supposed to go out tonight. I guess I gave him my number. I didn't call him back. so i guess i am a shit by blowing him off. story of my life i guess. i don't know what i was thinking by agreeing to go out with him. i guess the mimosas at 10 am and amstels got to me by 8 pm and my judgement was marred. unfortunately, this probably is not the last I have heard from him. apparently, he is involved with one of my father's projects, so i am sure I have not heard the end of this.... gotta lay low for a while. am i a shit for deleting his messages and not returning his calls? maybe i should have done the mature thing and told him the truth over the phone. i just can't be that mean. it is easier to ignore- isn't it??

      In my effort to maintain my fitness, and attempting to burn off some calories from monday's extravaganza, I decided to supplement my morning run with an afternoon power walk.  I got more than I bargained for.  About a mile away from home, Kendall started going nuts, and ran out in the middle of the road. I pulled her back, thinking it was just a squirrel or a deer, which it normally is. I looked over to see what was driving her so insane. It was two small kittens. In the middle of nowhere, on the side of the road.  Once I acknowledged  their presence, they ran across the street towards me. Kendall was licking her chops, thinking they were a snack. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't just leave them there in the middle of the road. So, with Kendall growling and leaping around like a kangaroo, I scooped them into my arms and headed for home. It was rather difficult to juggle two small kittens in my arms and keep Kendall from devouring them, but I made it home with my new little friends. I know I can't keep them, as much as I want to. It sickens me to think of how or why they ended up there, on the side of a country road. But I'd like to think that I was meant to walk that way today, and I was meant to find little Merry and Pippin. (yeah, I am a dork.)  Not the question remains- what to do with them. It is clear that with Kendall, having a cat (let alone 2) Is not a possibility. Not to mention the fact that my mom's landlord looked less than thrilled when I came home with my new little friends. The animal shelter was not open by the time I got back. Part of me wants to take them down there tomorrow morning, but my dad suggested that I try to give them away at the farm this weekend. I don't know what to do, and I don't want to get too attached. A lot of it also depends how kendall handles the rest of the evening.  I must be an animal magnet or something. Two or three years ago, I stumbled across a kitten in a hotel room in Meridian, Mississippi on my way to New Orleans. I hope Mississippi Frodo is doing well....  Ok, I am going to go check on the little ones.... rock on. And if you are a local and know anyone who wants a kitten, e mail me or leave a comment.

      I am never drinking again. I have to remember that I am back in NY. Worse than that, I am back in the place where everyone knows me- where I have many enemies, and very few friends. throwing alcohol into the mix only complicates matters. At the time it seemed like a good idea, but in retrospect, I should never have gotten on that bus.  I went to the  urlLink track  yesterday.  It was a bus trip with the local bar, with free food and alcohol all day. I thought it would be cool to go with my father and bond, and try to make some $$. He ended up trying to pawn me off on one of his married friends. The dude was a nice enough guy, but 1. he is married, 2. he is 11 years older than me, and 3. he was not terribly attractive.  Then, who steps on the bus but this asshole that i punched in the face at a concert last summer.  At that point i knew it would be a bad day. We successfully avoided any altercation, but we weren't exactly civil to one another.  All in all, the day wasn't that bad. I lost $20, and ended up giving out my phone # to way too many people. I think my dad is pissed at me for running m mouth about something- only bits and pieces of the day have been filtering back into my mind. I think I agreed to go on a date with the married guy. Maybe he will lose my number or forget to call. Keep your fingers crossed.  Yesterday reminded me again why I left this area in the first place. I didn't want to become one of them. I didn't want to become a townie. I have come to the conclusion that even though I am back, I don'y have to end up like these people. I am going to distance myself from that whole scene- pretend like I never came back. It might be difficult. I think I'll have to get a new cell phone-   In other YAY news- I have my computer back. It is virus, wine, and pee free. I can actually use the keyboard. Oh yeah, and I am no longer unemployed!! I will be starting my  urlLink new job  on monday. I am uber psyched. I'm thinking this place will (hopefully) pan out better than the last two crap jobs I had.  Well thats enough for now....
