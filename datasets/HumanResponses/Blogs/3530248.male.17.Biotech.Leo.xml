      This has been quite the awesome weekend.   today i ran 11 miles went to work for four hours and then roller bladed with karl laurie sarah and kim then movie watched oceans 11 with the same minus laurie. Mucho amusante :)   yesterday i... hung out with karl laurie and sarah tried to go watch allie be awesome in the hurdles the state finals aka federations and yet the burban just couldnt get it there on time or perhaps cuz i keep getting off at the wrong exit and have to drive down the one road of cns that has about 9 million stop signs... anyways then the old guy wouldnt let me just go in to see the results even if krazy, sar, and k's special friend stayed outside soooo after plotting to run over the old man and his stupid admission table we went back to lauries car at the mall then decided to walk around then to see SOUL PLANE fo shizzle my nizzle the hotness.. it was ok lol. thennn everyone set off to lafayette and i remained to meet my next appointment em sar and jo pretty sweet if you ask me 3 hotties me and a second viewing of shrek 2 then em went home to sleepy for to be rested for an action packed day at the sleazy of tully then the burban followed the dragon to little gem most excellent fun  so yea this weekend has been freaking great. the perfect blend of work and play .. a bit too much wallet leakage but hey live a little.    ======== = happiness is imeasurable when everything is pleasurable such times as these can only be formed and then enjoyed by me thanks to all my friends time like this would be better to never end          =  ================

      Even though i told people i wouldn't use this to summarize my lifes days... I just might.  First off congrats to Allie(!!!) for being awesome in the 400 hurdles. Just amazing.  Then of course it was an action packed evening with my entertainer... off roading in the 'burban, losing in the point game, then it was Harry... It was good but a dissapointment not too much excitement something about it just didnt live up to the first couple. Still good though but not as jaw dropping awesome as i had been expecting.  Umm today its either shrek 2 again or watching allie(!!!) be f*ing awesome in running over little barriers... i think i'll do both :) yea thats it.  o----------------o forced creativity tragically livid yet to fill the void prolongs the monotony o----------------------o

      ----------------- palm trees liquid motion tropical breeze peaceful ocean  palm trees freeze by the fiery ocean the volcanoes sneeze a frightening notion  the tropical clock cant stop the quartz that precious topical rock gaurded by demonic forts  the history goes on like a bad pop song resounding like a gong enthusing as ping-pong ----------------------  Shout out to the hottie entertainer!
