      Well, I made it one day without a game. I then had some work to do downstairs, and one thing turned to another. I actually went on a huge tilt. I should have known my night was going to be bad with the following hands:  $5/1 Tourney 9d3h : Bet $50 5 people call.  Flop Ks10h9s  I check Next Guy Bets $150, Two other people call, I Fold  Next two cards: 9h9c. Would have been nice. If only I could have checked into the next card. Oh Well. I think the call was the correct one over the long hall but it still hurts. The worst part about it is about 3 hands later I did it again! I saw 2 sets of 4 of a kind in one night, and I made nothing on either one!!!   Anyway, my whole night was like that. My Qd flush trumped by Ad. The guy was taunting me to bet, and I should have known better. I went out 5th with my $850 stack gone, knowing that the call was the wrong decision. I keep making the wrong decisions, and then making poor decisions trying to get into a hand. I missed making a boat because I folded, but that turned out well, as the other player ended up with a SF. I think I lost 5 $5/1 Tourneys and then $10 on some ring games before I brought my stack back up to $170 with a second place finish in a $10/$1 tourney.  On a better note, I was able to get in a few games in .50/1$ ring play. I lost $10. I then went to a 6 player 1/2$ table. The competition was extremely easy here, and I brought my stack all the way from $150 up to almost $200 again. That was a nice feeling. I may try the $1/$2 tables again. I put in $20 to play, which lets me go round enough times to try and get ahead a little. I like the 6-person format. I think I do MUCH better with fewer players and a little larger pot.  I am going to try a $10/$1 tourney and some more $1/2 ring games to see how I do tonight. If I loose $30 my goal is to stop myself at that point, and wait another day to make it up. If I win $50 my goal is to stop at $250 and call it a night. I will keep you informed.

      Day one of my self imposed exile went well. I did not play any poker. It helped that my second job (Mon/Wed) ended up being later than usual. I did not get out of there until 10PM. The life of a programmer! Oh well. Nothing good to report.   I had a nice dream that I was head to head in the final table of WSOP and was playing rings around the top pro's. It was a nice dream. Everything I did worked out. The pro's were yelling at me, and telling me my stupid play sucked. Except every time I would beat them bad, and taunt them some more. I probably should stop taunting people. It is kinda rude. Oh well. I am a good looser, but a bad winner.  I think the exile will go well for the next 3 days. The Red Sox and Yankees are playing, and while this is a GREAT game to watch while playing poker, it also work fine by itself.  I can not wait to get back to the tables. I have been reading up, and I think instead of moving to the $10/1 tourney tables all the time, I might keep slaughtering people at $5/1, but play 2-3 tables at once. I will try this and see how it works.

      It is very important to have a distraction when playing tournament games. It keeps you from going in just to see a hand. So here is my top 10 winners:   10. Twilight Zone (Sci-Fi) 9. Inuyasha (Cartoon Network) 8. Yu Yu Hakisha (Cartoon Network) 7. Aqua Teen Hunger Force (Cartoon Network) 6. Case Closed (Cartoon Network) 5. Cowboy Bebop (Cartoon Network) 4. Howard Stern (E!) 3. WPT (Travel Channel) 2. Hollywood Home Game (Travel Channel)  And the number one show to gamble by:  1.	Major League Baseball – Red Sox! (Talk about gambling!)

      I have my pot up to a tad under $200, and I did this with some bad playing. I played a few $10 tourneys. Brought my pot down from $175 to $138 and one point, then played some more tourneys, finally hit a few, got back to around $170. I then started watching White Dwarf on Sci-Fi. It was interesting, so I did some .50/1$ ring play, and went from $5 to $16. Ending up at $198+. Anyway, even though I was on a little tilt, and not slowing down, I ended up ok. Not very pleasing to me. I am going to take a couple of days off since I have been staying up way too late playing, and need to focus at work a little. We will have to see how well I do taking time off. I am already a Video Game Addict, and when you add gambling to the mix there is a good chance to go off the deep end as I have been a little. Getting some more discipline and staying off the tables for a few days will be a good thing.

      I was thinking about my play latetly and think it has been good. I think I did two very good things the other night that I am proud of.  The first was on a questionable play. I got Pocket Rockets, had about $2,000. Bet them up to 4xBB or 200 bucks. A few people were in with me. Flopped 3-9-2. Nothing scary. Possible straight draw. So I bet another $200. One person calls, the other two fold. A J comes on the turn. I bet again, $400 hoping to knock the late player out. The player calls me. The final card comes up, it is a 7. No help for anyone. I figure my rockets are good. I am not sure why the last person is still in however, so I bet small, $200. She calls. Shows me Trip 3's! Being the whiny bitch I can be I complain alot. Anyway, this play is not what I am happy about. I played well, if not correctly, probably should have folded when the caller showed no hesitation. What makes me happy is instead of self destructing, and going in on bad hands, I collected myself, keep it together, and won the tourney. First place. Including a BAD beat tho the chick who got me with the 3's. I think keeping my cool was a good step in my growth as a player.  The second thing I was pleased with, and this is alot more marginal, is a call I made. I had KK, bet it light, had a few calls, finally it gets down to me and another guy. A 4th spade shows at the river, and the other guy pauses for a minute, and then calls all in. Now I had a decent hand in trips, but something in the way he hesitated, and the way he had been betting, convinced me that he had not made the straight. I instantly called him, and beat his hand. Now I know this could be considered a bad call, but I think poker has something to do about reading people, and this read was sooo strong, and sooo right, I think I did the right thing.  Anyway, I hope I am getting better. My bankroll has been growing steadily, and I would like to see it succeed.

      After hovering around 140 for a while, I finally had a good day. Pushed myself up to $175 playing 5/1 tourney. I seem to do well in these. I have finished 3 1st, 1 3rd, and a few out in the last few days. I am going to move up to $10 for a hand or two. Try and take some bigger pots.   I still stink at .50/$1. I keep falling into the bad play trap. I see people taking huge pots on A high, and suddenly that becomes a great hand! All in baby! At least I am limiting myself to $5 at a time.

      Had a decent night tonight. Play a $5 tourney, and came in first. Then I wasted $15 of that losing a $10 tourney and $5 in .50/1. I then entered another $5 tourney and came in first again. Go figure. My style of play seems well suited to tourneys.   I have been using Poker Tracker, but to be honest, I have no idea what any of the stats mean. I do see that I am not an aggressive player (where I would have said I was tight/aggressive). Maybe my lack of aggression allows me to get into the final 3, then loosen up and win! Could be a good strategy.   Here are the finishing moves on my last tourney. Very fun:   ***** Hand History for Game 702933641 ***** SirFWALGMan: nh 500/1000 TourneyTexasHTGameTable (NL) (Tournament 4368431)  - Sat Jun 26 00:53:09 EDT 2004 Table Table  12453 (Real Money) -- Seat 2 is the button Total number of players : 2 Seat 2: EazyZ (3880) Seat 7: SirFWALGMan (4120) EazyZ  posts small blind (250) SirFWALGMan  posts big blind (500) ** Dealing down cards ** Dealt to SirFWALGMan [ Js, 3d ]  EazyZ calls (250) SirFWALGMan checks. ** Dealing Flop ** :  [ 8s, 9d, Jd ]  SirFWALGMan bets (1000) EazyZ calls (1000) ** Dealing Turn ** :  [ 2d ]  SirFWALGMan bets (2620) SirFWALGMan is all-In.

      Oh well. It happens to everyone. I had a bad night after the good night I previously reported. I was up to $150. I then proceeded to loose 2 $10 tourneys badly, and $5 at a table game.   The first $10 table the only mistakes I made were calling into large bets with marginal hands. For instance, I would get an A3 suited, which is a hand I love and always want to see the flop for. Unfortunately there was a guy at the table that constantly raised 200$-300$ just for the hell of it. He was taking hands, but more often than not, he did not have to show. It is a very interesting strategy, probably not for me. So anyway, I would get a little antsy, and call one of these bets, get a bad flop, and finally ended up in a bad way. If I was smarter I would probably have laid down on those bets, and let other people go out faster.  The second $10 table I do not think I made a mistake, I just got killed at the river. I start with a marginal hand 8h 10s. I am the big blind, so I check in, and get to see a flop. The flop ends up being 10h 5d 3d. Sweet. I have the high pair! No straights in sight. A possible flush, but not bad. So the guy with all the luck at the table calls me all in. We flip cards, and he has Qd 2d. I am thinking I have a good shot at this. Just need to dodge 2 25% chances and I am doubled up. As shows up. I am thinking ya! I am going to make it! Then the Kd comes, nailing me at the river. I feel bad about being beat, but I do not think it was a bad bet. If anyone has an opinion let me know.  So then I am getting angry, decide to play .50/$1 table to try and make back some of my money, and play poorly and loose there too. At least I was able to just say goodnight and wait for another day. We will have to see what happens tonight.

      I am playing online in the .5/1$ Empire Poker table. I am playing very strong opening hands only. I am up $7 in the first 5 minutes.   I do not know what people at these tables are thinking. I have been called at the river several times with A High nothing, Low Set, and other junk. Even when I bet heavy into every hand, I still have 2-3 people calling everything.   I just do not understand these people. I think my strategy of going in on premium hands only let's me almost always win large pots at the river. I understand I will never make alot of money here, but this is crazy! I kind of like doing a tourney game (I came in first in a 5$ NL), and using $5 from my winnings to try and make some money at the little tables.  Soon I will be caught up from my loosing ways. I dropped $200 while learning how to play better. I am up to $145 now, with about a week of good play. Not too bad.   Anyway, I downloaded Poker Tracker and I am going to start playing with the free version. So far I have not seen much good, especially since there are SOOOO many people, I hardly see the same ones. But maybe it will help. Will post about it sometime this week.

      I figure I will talk about some of my bad tendencies today, since one of the reared it’s ugly head last night. I like to call it the Dark and Deadly Spiral. Anyway, it went something like this.  I was looking for some good tourney play last night. I got through playing a $5 tournament, and going out about 5th. I think I played really well, but I just did not get the cards. I was getting kind of antsy down around $400, so followed a K2 suited a little too far, getting beat down to like $100, and then went out on the next hand.   Anyway, Empire poker then started having a lot of problems with there system. Not sure what was going on, but all tournaments were not working. So I take my $5 and reluctantly head for the $5 table. I decide to play my normal conservative tournament style play, and see what happens. After a while I am up to $20, and feeling pretty good. I then do something really stupid. I follow A’s down to the end, betting in every round, figuring the possible straight was just bluffing. He was not. So I loose $5. I then start the spiral. I feel like I need to win the huge amount I lost back quickly, so I start playing hands that are marginally good. Which causes me to loose more. I start feeling like I have to make it all back on the next hand. Now I am playing really poorly, going in on bad hands, following 2 cards to a straight too far, doing stupid stuff. This is the Dark and Deadly Spiral. When you take a bad beat, or start getting down, and try and make it all back in one hand. You spiral out of control, and loose it all. I was lucky last night. I calmed myself down when I got down to a few bucks, started playing only premium hands (20 points or more in Black Jack, or Suited A High or K High) caught a nice A high flush that people started betting into, and a few hours later ended up with $27, up $22 for the session. The point is: if your feeling desperate, or your changing your style after a bad beat, calm down, take a breath, and play the way you know you should.

      Online poker is all the rage these days. Ever since the Travel channel started televising the WSOP everyone wants to play. It seems so simple, watching these guys make their moves. It’s exciting to see the pair of 4’s beat the AA when both players call all in. It is fun to second-guess the great poker players of the world.   I decided to start playing online poker for several reasons.   A.	It is fun. The excitement when you call all in is amazing. You never know if your hand is really going to win, and as those cards start appearing, your heart starts racing, the endorphins kick in, it is a real rush!  B.	It seems easy. Watching on television, and then playing in free tournaments online it seemed very easy to win. Before I ever picked up a book and tried to figure out how to play, I was winning in free tournaments.   C.	You can make money. I am still trying to get to the point where it would be profitable. I will keep everyone posted as to my win/loss state as I progress in the game, but I think you can make decent amounts of money online.  Once I decided to play for some money I picked up a few books on playing.  I decided to read Ken Warren Teaches Texas Holdem. I found it to be a decent book on playing. It gives nice simple lists of hands that you should go in on, based on pot odds and position at the table.  I signed up with Empire Poker. It was a little scary giving them a credit card number, but they have some other options you can use. I find the site very easy to use, and the UI is very good. You have to download an Application that installs on your system and handles the gaming. It is all very easy to setup. I use the screen name of SirFWALGMan (Maybe let you know what the hell that stands for later), so if you see me at Empire say hello.  Obviously I though I would jump straight into 1/2, 2/4 dollar tables and start making some money. This was probably a mistake; since I tended to loose money ask quickly as I made it. It is much easier to win a little money, and much safer, by playing in online tournaments. It is very easy to loose a lot of money quickly in table games. So while I am in my learning stage I am sticking to the 5$ and 10$ tourneys. The way these work is you pay the ante plus 1$ fee for the poker site. If you wind up being one of the last 3 players, you win the pot. Each tournament has 10 players, so for a 5$ tourney the take is 25, 15, and 10. The $10 tourney is $50, $30, and $20. I have found that the key to winning these is playing good starting hands, and knowing when to fold.   I will post more of my observations and some of the games I play in future BLOGS. Let me know if any of this is interesting.

      Small tilt last night. Played some good poker and some really bad poker. The one thing that really annoys me about NL is you can spend the night making a nice pot, and then lose it all on one hand when your not quite the NUTS.   Last night was one of those nights where&nbsp;I had the following things happen. Trips beaten by Higher Trips (2x), Flush Beaten by Higher Flush (4x), 2 Pair with the high card beaten by two pair with the high card and a higher second card. I think is was Q3 vs Q7.   I had some good hands too. KK gets called to the river by a maniac on the 5/10 tables (this is the tilt part) and wins a huge pot. I found the best 5/10 table of my life, but my inconsistency only allowed me to take 5BB out. I mean this maniac was pre-flop raising on almost anything. He would raise you if he had an A and you bet on a flop with J-rag-rag. All the way to the river and then beyond, even though he did not have two cards to rub together. Unfortunately this lead me to a syndrome I like to call "He can't ever get a good card syndrome". I.E. Nahh, He doesn't have the boat. I am going to call him like a fish.   Anyway, I think I need more consistency. I see a lot of my nights going like 10 bucks up, 5 bucks down, 20 bucks up, 15 bucks down. I think it has to do a lot with getting too loose when I start winning. I need to buckle down. I really respect the people on the tables who never give anything back. While I am doing my best yo-yo imitation they steadily, 1 pot here, 1 pot there, build up a nice winning night.   The funny thing about last night was if I had quit at 12AM I would have had the same amount of money as when I did quit at 3-4AM. Anyway, working, working, working. I still like the $25 tables even though I took a little beating last night. I just need to be disciplined enough to say "I am going to lose/win 1 $25 NL, and 1 $40 1/2 per session." If I lose then so be it. If I win, then I take the winning and leave. Keeping a consistent amount every night is a good idea. I think it might even be good to say leave when I lose $65, leave when I get to $140, and then fall back $10. That way if I am riding a good table I do not just leave because I won some money. Anyway, going to play around. Probably a lot of nights I will leave just a little ahead. Still trying to catch the illusive $1200.

      I think there is a $2500 Thursday freeroll tonight at Empire. If so, I am going to try and take 1st again. As some of my loyal readers may have noticed, I took 3rd last time for a nice $235 win to get me up to $950 again. This was very nice, since I had decimated my pot down to $615 while on a slight tilt playing levels I should not be in. Only one person gave me congrats on finishing 3rd in my first multi-tourney, so for him I am going to try a new feature tonight. I will update my Blog every&nbsp;30 minutes with my current standing, any interesting new, etc.. So you can see how Sir does if he lasts more than 30 minutes this time. I am going to use the old fashion method of winning one of these: Fold most of my hands until the 4th round, and then try and make some money. Anyway, keep tabs on this post tonight. If I get to play in this one I will try my hand at some live reporting.   &nbsp;  *** Update: No Freeroll tonight. Sorry. The next freeroll for playing hands&nbsp;is in August sometime. Playing some NL again. Winning again. Up to $1086. &nbsp;

      Ok. First off I have a question for the experienced NL players there. I was reading Anisotropy and his success at $25 NL interested me. So I am down a little tonight. I decide I will go ahead and try it. I put my $25 in (sort of like playing $40 at a 1/2 table), and start playing. Now the cards were in love with me I admit. I flopped alot of good stuff. I even got some good draw hands, which is really hard in NL. Anyway, about 1/2 hour later I am up to $125 and loving it. The second to last hand I played against someone who kepy calling me a rookie. I had K9s and he had J8o or something. Scary flop of AQQA. He goes all in with like 14$. I decide to call because I want to lose and go to sleep. Anyway, I win with K high. He was SOOOOOOO pissed. Anyway, here are my two NL questions:   A) Does it make sense to see more flops in NL. If it only costs me .25 (I.E. Less than an Ante in 1/2) then should I not see if Q3 might flop QJ3 or QQ3 or QQQ or some other nice hand for Q3? I mean look at the pot odds. It cost me less than 1/4 of 1 bet, and if I make it the implied odds are infinate. I was called a rookie looser for getting Q3 two pair, and calling someone down to the river while he bet 2 aces at 4$ per round.   B) This one is a little more shaky. I go in with 9-2h. I get a nice flop with 2 hearts. Now, I am getting 3 people action in the pot. Each one is adding 4$ per round, and I am the Button. Now, from an Implied Odds and Odds standpoint, am I not correct in calling? It is one thing if they put me all in and I have not made my flush, or if they bet the pre-flop with 4-5$. However, am I not right in playing this if they keep it reasonable?   So anyway the lucky (true)&nbsp;rookie (true) left the tables with $100 profit. Like 50BB of what I usually play. Another question I have. Why do people get mad when you play flushes in general? I have made THE MOST money playing flushes. There are two big reasons for this: A. When I make it I am 90% of the time the best hand and can tell it. and B) NOBODY respect someone on a flush draw at Empire. I freaking had the 3 diamonds on the table, and I bet $5, and I get raised $15 with 2 pair!!!! I mean you do not have to be a chicken, but cmon! So anyway, this rookie, looser, idiot, lucky, fish, dummy is going to sleep. Have a nice night!   Uncle says "One Last Thing" -- I am going to play more $25 NL. I am going to treat it like a $20/1 NL Tourney. Either I win and make alot of money, or lose and hey.. I was on the bubble, and so be it. I figure it is a better use of my money than a tourney. I will probably play the $25 NL first, then a Tourney to keep in practice for the WSOP, and then if it has been a good night some limit.

      Why is it that dedication to ones art is always so misunderstood? If I am learning to play Poker why is it not an art form? Is it not a type of art? Is there not an essence of creativity in the way one plays? The slashing strokes of a Phil Ivey, the beautiful and graceful calculations of a Slansky, the deep soul piercing gaze of a Lederer .. are these not masters of there art? No, these are degenerates, scum of the earth, sleazy hustlers to be scorned and shunned! Why can people not recognize that the artistic nature takes many forms. I consider many things to be art, Paulies paintings, computer programming, writing, and yes, Poker! It requires dedication, study, and yes, your own artistic flair to be successful. So why is it that Poker players are looked down upon? I have yet to see one cut off his ear (or poke out his eyes?), I mean talk about crazy! So all you Van Goghs and Picasso’s of the world keep it up. Even if I cant tell what side is up in an art gallery, I appreciate watching someone played like a Stradivarius on the Poker tables.

      Had a good night discipline wise. I lost about $50 and was able to walk away. Did not try and win it all back on 5/10. I think this is a good step. Just could not catch a break until the last table. I had my trips beaten by larger trips. After that a guy had his boat beaten by a higher boat. I did not feel so bad after that. Kind of a bummer that I have fallen a little below 1K but I am happy with my game. I think I tend to go on a tilt at key points, I.E. I made 1K, but then fell below! My “marker” of 1K was gone. I need to get back there. Start tilting to do it!!! Stupid. I am glad I was able to avoid it this time. Hopefully I have it under control.  The final table I was on was AEWSOME. Basically there was one maniac at the table. He would call a pre-flop raise on almost anything. Any two cards suited. Any potential straight. His strategy worked at times, but the variance was huge, and he kept busting out. He also refused to see when he was beaten. I had A2d and the flop was something like 4d5cJd. He had raised initially so the pot was a decent size. He bets. I call. Kd was the next hand making my flush. He bets. I raise. He raised. We top out the betting at 8 bucks each. Next card was some rag. He again tops it off. So now there is over $40 in a ½ pot with me holding the nut high flush. We turn over. He has two pair and I have the flush. The guy did this several times before slowing down and saying “Man, my wife is going to kill me, can you guys let me win one.”. Now I do not mind giving money away (ok, maybe I do), but why would anyone give money to a clown that is playing as badly as this guy. He went through $40, re-bought, and went through another $40 while I was at the table.  I have been playing more tourneys. I finished 3rd, 4th, and 4th last night. Just could not get the cards when I needed them. I think my strategy for the week is going to be to play a single $10/1 tourney and $40 at ½ each night. Play a few hours. Get some sleep. I will see where this leaves me at the end of the week. I am also going to see if I am enrolled in the Thursday Night $2500 free roll again. I have been playing enough raked hands that I think I should be. It would be VERY nice to place 3rd or higher again. I am going to take it easy thought, at least until we get to the money hands, and see what happens. Hopefully I will get the advantage of an empty table to being with again. It really helps starting with 10K!! You can basically cruise into the 60th spot with 600 people starting. It only pays $10 or something, but it is free money.  Talking about Tourneys – I think the proper strategy for me is to put it on AWAY for the first 3 levels, and let the poor players fight it out. Playing ring games has made me like flush draws too much. In a ring game, you make a lot of money when you make your draws. In a tourney, it costs too much to make those draw, unless the person has nothing, in which case it is not worth winning the draw. I read a strategy in my NL Hold em book that I like. It basically says to not play anything before the 4th level when the blinds become worthwhile, except JJ and higher pairs and AK, AQ, AJ. So basically you will not be playing much before level 4. Now this gives you two advantages. First, it makes you seem like a VERY tight player. The first few hands you play on level 4 you will get a lot of respect on. A bluff might not be out of the question. Second, it probably gives you above average stack. Usually in these single table tourneys by level 4 I see: 1-3 seats out, 1-3 seats with $500 or less, and 1-3 seats with 1K or more. So you are right there in the mix. I will let you know how this strategy works out.

      Game is going well. Getting slowly back to 1100. Playing well. Keeping it under control. Good discipline. Not alot of chances to go overboard because I am playing well.   I am going down to Ocean City for Vacation -- Beach. Sand. Chicks. Wife? Oh damn! Anyway, the wife mentioned we should go for a night out in AC! So all you Bloggers out there with live experience in AC let me know where to go. I want the wife to enjoy, so it should either have a nice resterant or be near one I guess. Anyway, any tips would be appreciated. This will probably be my second live game, so even basic tips would be good. I think I am going to suck at live, but we will see.   I cannot wait for Patriots Season.. I mean football season. The pats are looking good in there division this year. I think we at least make the playoffs. Bad Blood has an EXCELENT write up on the NFC at his site. Someone should do an AFC one! Not me, I am not a good football handicapper.   &nbsp;  *** Correction: It is not&nbsp;Bad Bloods site, it is Anisotropy&nbsp;. My appologies, but both sites are worth visiting. Not sure how I made that mistake.

      I am totally convinced that playing Poker has nothing to do with Poker. It has nothing to do with cards, or probability or anything else. Any given session can kick your butt even if you are the best player on the planet. Like the other night when I had my Ace High Flush with everyone in ($300 pot probably) beaten by a runner-runner boat! Can you believe that? The person playing is calling and raising with a pair of Jacks. Oh well.. if I see her again its payback time!   Anyway, back to the point. I think everything in Poker revolves around keeping yourself in control. In order to win, you have to be able to accept losing. You need to be disciplined enough to say “Not my night” and walk away down. You cannot fall sooo in love with your hand that you do not pay attention to what might be. You have to be strong enough to say, “Ok, this is not the flop that KK is going to win”. You need to know that a better hand is coming around the corner, and wait for it. Know your opponent and what his tendencies are. When you can read him like a book, he will always pay out for you. Patience. Discipline. Strength. Observation. These are the ingredients that make a good Poker player. Grinding it out day after day. You are the champions. So raise your glasses and drink a toast to all good Poker players out there!

      Arg! Frustrated! Bad Sir!! 5-10 for fun. Tilt. Down to 700. 10-20. Up to 1074 again. STUPID!STUPID!STUPID!STUPID!  Anyway.. thats my rant for tonight. Finishing up on a 1/2 table to see if I can get back to 1100 again. No big deal if I do not. I am pissed at my last of discipline. Oh well. We will see what happens tomorrow. Gotta stay away from the tempting tables for now..

      Been at a nice table having a nice day. Up 32 bucks playing 1/2 right now. Got a RSF which was really nice. I like this table because I raise the first bet. I flop K's with Ace Kicker. Get everyone raising up to 4 BB. I then get Ace High Flush. I bet. They slow down, but keep betting me. Pay me all the way to the river. These guys are betting second and third pair to the river. One person had a pair of eights, and AJ9K or something was on the board, and they are calling and calling... sweet! I am up to $989. Not bad for an hour or so. Hope to clear over 1K today. When I get to $1200 I am going to cash $155 out. I am going to buy Poker Tracker and fix my leaks, and take $100 for a present.&nbsp;Only bad thing about this table is I have been rivered like 5 times!!!!   My game is still stalled a little. Still working on discipline problems, and trying to play consistent.&nbsp; Not much to report here, but I wanted my two regular readers to get a little update.   Two last things: I really appreciate Chris Halverson giving advice. He has always been ready to put his 2 cents in, and there usually worth alot more.   Never do a top ten poker blog list!!!! WARNING: You will regret it. You will forget someone, number 11 will be sad because you forgot him, number 12 will think you abandoned him! The guilt alone is not worth it. So next time I list Blogs it is going to be the top 500!   Won a 5/1 and 10/1 tourney tonight to get my earnings up to $1046. I cannot wait until I hit 1200! Then I will be asking all you Bloggers out there how the hell to make any sense of Poker Tracker Stats.

      So, I was logging into Empire just to check my balance, and all of the sudden I find myself enrolled in a Free Roll. Now I have NEVER played multi-table. So I get into this Free Roll I knew nothing about. First hand. J-10. I call. What the hell, might as well get in for a hand. Bang! Everyone folds. Wow! They must have heard of Sir! 7-2. Bang! Fold! Man I am good! Go Hammer! Fold. Fold. Fold. Ok. Something weird is going on. I am not THAT well known, or good. So I figure out nobody is at my table. Blinds keep going up, and I am at a nice 10K before I even figure out this is not an NL Free Roll! Imagine my surprise when the ALL-IN button did not show up!  Now, I am not very good at tourney coverage, so here are the highlight Sir style.  Played level and stayed mid stack for most of the game.   Level 10. Cowboys. 10's to trips. Went from 21K to 77K.Called down the river with my Cowboys by 77. 13th Place.  Folded a few hands.  Level 14. Nice Level. Alot of pairs that paid off.  Up to 110K. Big Stack!! Next stack is 75K. Not bad. Looking good.   8th Place. 3K Blinds!!!!  Level 15. Nothing good. Went in for a couple of flush draws.  Nothing good. 119K.   Second Place in chips, 7 people left.   Hope level 16 shows me some good stuff!  Level 16 going well. Up to 245K. KJ, picked up trip K's. Some idiot bets me to the river.Stupid bet on flush draw to the river. Oh well. 221K.  Ran down the river. Some bad calls. Had trips against A5 straight. Went out at 3AM. 3rd Place. $225. Not too shabby for a free roll. I think I did the Bloggers proud!    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      The following are the ten Blogs I enjoy the most daily. It has nothing to do with how good they are, and number 11 is not a bad Blog. I actually read all of the Blogs on my list on a regular basis and enjoy them a lot. Also, this is a good place to say that if you’re on my list and I have your site name mangled, or you would like to be listed differently, let me know. I will make changes as soon as I can.  I figured I would post these now, since my reading time will be going down. I took a support job after killing myself for over a year with a startup for nothing. Moral of that story: Make sure you get everything in writing.  So, support is usually a sucky job. You help people when things are going on, and twiddle your thumbs when nothing is happening. I never usually take support jobs  but I wanted to get out of the startup, and the support job was with a company I had done work with in the past, and wanted to keep a good relationship with.  Apparently my boss thinks I would be a good fit for their JSP/Struts/BEA work here. I am mostly a MicroSerf, although I do not have  blind allegiance to Bill and his megalomaniac dreams. I do some Java, but it is not my strong point. I will be doing all  of the Java work and support here for the near future. At least it is development again. Should be fun. Will definitely cut down  on my Blog Reading though. Here is the list you all have been waiting for:  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  10.  urlLink Up For Anything   &nbsp;  Excellent perspective and write-ups not just on his game, but on all of the happenings is the poker world. I enjoy the site a lot.  &nbsp;  9.  urlLink Poker Perspectives   &nbsp;  I like reading Maudie’s perspectives. “Ain’t nuthin’&nbsp; was especially funny! Her tourney descriptions are a very good read also.  &nbsp;  8.  urlLink Felicia Lee   &nbsp;  Purrrrrdy! Heh. Just kidding! Although the nice picture of Felicia is a plus. Felicia plays a wide variety of games, and it is interesting to hear her perspectives on these. She travels all over the place playing live and it is great to hear about all of her adventures! I really like the writing style a lot.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  7.  urlLink Rymes with Joker   &nbsp;  Lord Geznikor .. Sir FWA .. Comon! How would I not like this guy! Heh. His explanation of his name recently was very funny. I can relate. I played Baldur’s Gate too.. My name is from a video game also. I will post a full description in the future. If anyone wants to take a guess at what game my name is from go ahead. Excellent descriptions of his hands and how and why he played them. Very good reading.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  6. .  urlLink Al Cant Hang   &nbsp;  I like Al’s life! Actually I like his Monkeys life, but that sounded too pathetic to lead off with. I think Al’s Blog combines a lot of different elements, not all poker, into a great end product. I love the breakdowns of other sites, and the links to good poker information. It is always interesting to read. I would move him up a few spots if his Blog weren’t so damn long! I only have a few hours to goof off Al! Do not deny it, I have proof: Al Word Count (3159), Sir (2300), and my post was longer than usual, and yours was shorter!  &nbsp;  5.  urlLink Guinness and Poker   &nbsp;  Sorry for saying Al had long posts! Iggy (20,142) is the king! His site is great if you either want to hear about drinking, or what’s going on in the poker world. I enjoy his posts, even if I have to read them a few times to get all the way through. Keep up the good work!  &nbsp;  4.  urlLink Tao of Poker   &nbsp;  Who wouldn’t like the Tao of Poker. Excellent writing. Good art work. Contests galore! There is always something new and exciting at Paulies site. Gambling of all weird types goes on here! Very enjoyable!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  3.  urlLink Chris Halverson   &nbsp;  I always enjoy the writing in Chris’s site. It is always very good, and he changes up the subject all the time. One week its about his play, another about Hollywood Home Game, who knows what is next. I also appreciate the way Chris reaches out to other Bloggers. He was one of the first people to post a comment on my site, and encourages people to play poker and write about it.  &nbsp;  2.  urlLink Sloe Times   &nbsp;  I like Sloejack. It seems like we are connected together by some weird Poker Karma. Sometimes it seems when I have bad days, he does too. He is always there with a nice word too. I think the appeal of his site to me is that Sloe and I seem to be on the same track. We seem to play around the same stakes. We seem to have some of the same success and failures. I would like to think our games might be similar, but it is hard to tell from a Blog. I think we are somewhere close to each other in our games, and it feels good to have someone there with you.  &nbsp;  1.  urlLink Table Tango   &nbsp;  I love this site. It gives me a look into the world of poker that my fat Internet butt has yet to see. I hate to laugh about the jerks at the tables, because I know they cause the writer of the Blog pain, but it is sooo damn funny. I guess the site appeals to the voyeur in everyone. I feel your pain – but I am laughing too. One good side effect of this site is the fact that I will try and treat the dealers with respect and give some tips when I am doing well.

      Not too much to report. The 1/2 fishies are still very fishie. I played very aggressively on the first game, and lost my initial $40. I then played a tiny bit less aggressive, which probably fits my style better, and won $95. So I ended up about $30, just peeking over $700. I also won 3rd place in a tourney. Could have won 2nd, but me and the 2nd place guy both went all in against 1st place, and lost. Oh well. I was happy to have played well enough to get to the end. My tourney game as been kinda weak lately, and I wanted to improve on it.  I played "The Hammer" tonight, just for the hell of it. Hit a straight on the river. Was slow playing my crap hand so I only made $5, but Go Hammer! I remember playing it because, it was .50, and hey, it's "THE HAMMER". ACEYOU22 is the jackass that is dissing my play. Here is the hand. Oh wait, I had nothing. Guess the Hammer scared people away. The river must have been another hand. Oh well, I told you they folded when I had a flush on the board:  ***** Hand History for Game 770156413 *****1/2 TexasHT GameTable (Limit)&nbsp; - Tue Jul 20 23:55:20 EDT 2004Table Table&nbsp; 12704  (6 max)  (Real Money) -- Seat 3 is the button Total number of players : 6 Seat 1: metsfanmo ( $34.75) Seat 2: sheldon47 ( $61.75) Seat 3: jsmcgruver ( $62.50) Seat 4: SirFWALGMan ( $80.98) Seat 5: reddogrs ( $6.50) Seat 6: ACEYOU22 ( $11.75) SirFWALGMan&nbsp; posts small blind (0.50) reddogrs&nbsp; posts big blind (1) ** Dealing down cards ** Dealt to SirFWALGMan [ 2h, 7s ]  ACEYOU22 folds. acemetsfanmo folds. sheldon47 folds. jsmcgruver calls (1) SirFWALGMan calls (0.50) SirFWALGMan: thanksreddogrs  checks.** Dealing Flop ** :&nbsp; [ 4s, 3c, 9s ]  SirFWALGMan: thanks for letting me check to the river too, heh.

He was calling me an XXXXXXX because I went in on 7-5 suited and caught a straight on the flop. In 6 handed play, I am in for almost any flush draw. I should be raising, but I am too passive for that. If I make 4 to my flush, then I am calling/raising to the river if I have 2-3 people in. This has made me some HUGE pots.&nbsp; It got so that people knew I played any flush, and if they saw a flush possability they would immediatly fold to any bet I made. It was nice. Anyway, I kind of get pissed off when people tell me that I am playing badly. I know it should not bother me, but I like the way I play. Hell, I was up $95 for the night, I must have been doing something right! I recently have read alot about being aggresive on draw hands when there are enough people in to make pot odds. Maybe this is an advanced concept for the people I play with? Why can they not understand this? Well.. more money for me.  One other thing about this guy, he said that I make poker less fun for other people. HELLO! I hope I do make it less fun. I hope I kick you butt so bad you go home crying to mommy. Jackass. Like it is my job to play badly like him so that he will have "Fun" playing. Jesus!  &nbsp;

      I had jury duty today! Ug! What a lousy way to spend a morning. Actually the morning was pretty good. I played ½ hour of ½ poker before my court date. I played fairly well. I ended up down 3 bucks for the session. Not so bad since I was down twenty when I started the table. I got up early because I was afraid they would fine me, or something, if I was late. I guess not. Mr. Showupattenthirty apparently did not get in trouble.  &nbsp;  I have only been called once in my 35 years on this earth, and that is plenty! Now I know some of you more civic minded people out there are going to give me a hard time for this post, and I probably agree with you somewhat, but I have a low tolerance for boredom! There is a great reason for this, when I am bored things break, or burn, or do other bad things. If I have nothing to do I get very antsy and somehow things get hurt. I should have been smarter and brought a few books. I did bring, and finally finish my Hold Em book. After that it was all Regis and Kitty or whoever that dumb blonde is on his show now. We did get to hear an interesting story about a stupid juror. I am not sure if this was made up, but I can believe there are people this stupid out there. Basically she got picked for a trial. Apparently the trial was going to take a little time, and really did not fit in with her schedule. So she announces to the other members of the jury that she is not going to show up the next day. She doesn’t, they tell, and she gets whacked with a 2K fine and another turn at jury duty. Moral of the story: The Judges are not amused with non-civic people!  &nbsp;  The judge who came and talked for 15 minutes about what a great person I was for coming before telling me to leave was kind of interesting. He was very happy that I showed up, like I had a choice, and thought I was a great guy. I bet he does not know I never even voted until I got married. At least it was only 15 more minutes.  &nbsp;  I was finally released from jail at around noontime. Having sat in two rooms, one of which was really hot, and never even seeing any of the scum I was supposed to convict. Oh well, better luck next time.  &nbsp;  I had a backup plan in case I got on a long superior court case. The main reason I would not want this to happen is that I am self-employed. I am a contract programmer, and I would not get paid for this week. So&nbsp;not only was I tortured&nbsp;today, but it&nbsp;cost me at least $200, talk about S&amp;M! Apparently a judge would think this was a lame excuse. So my plan: Take on a Texan Accent, and say something like “Is this here one of them tharrreee Black Cases, cause if it is I recahhnn he is guilty or it is only a matter of time, so we had better lock him up anyway!”. This might have worked. Who knows? Glad I did not have to try it. Just in case anyone in this PC crazy world thinks I really am a racist, it is true; I think all Texas talk like that!

      Well,  It has been a month or so since my initial $50 deposit into Empire. All in all it has been an interesting month. My puny $50 climbed the heights of almost 1K, and has fallen back down. If nothing else this month I am getting experience, and playing hands. I have been reading alot of Poker books. One thing that stands out in something I was reading the other night "It does not matter if your hand is the best or not, what matters is if your getting the odds to make the call". It had the usual formulae, etc.. but the point was if your going for a flush draw or straight draw make sure it counts. If you are against one person and have a single card to go for your flush, fold it, or check it down to the river if he will let you. Why put $5 into a pot, just to gain $5 at the most. You want to try and make your flush when 4-5 people are in calling you all the way to the river. Even in bluffing -- why bluff that you have the trips when a scary flop comes up? Do you need to risk your bet to take such a small pot? Probably not.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I have some goals for the next month. Basically I want to play like I did after I came down from my tilt. I was playing 1/2 until like 4AM this morning, and doing well. I probably only took $20 out of the pot for a couple of hours of play, but I think I played pretty well. I was playing the premium hands for the most part, where the rest of the table was raising A3. I had great reads on the other players. I even called someone down to the river who was pretending they had trips, but did not even have a pair. It was one of those calls where you have a feel for how the guy bets, and something did not add up.  &nbsp;  I want to stay away from the 5/10 table, and be able to have losing sessions without self destructing. My bankroll can stand losing $40 on 1/2 table. I can make that back. When I start losing $100 at a time, that is when it gets iffy. So hopefully we see less of Sir Tilt-Alot in the future. Discipline is probably 90% of poker.  &nbsp;  I&nbsp;need to get back to good, fundamental Poker. I think swimming with the fishies has lowered my standards too much. A3o is starting to look good to me. This is not a good thing. Second pair is looking like a playable hand! I have just been very inconsistent.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I keep reminding myself I am a newbie, and it takes time to really become a player. If it was easy, then everyone would be Phil Helmuth. I have reached a level of skill, but have alot to work on. I will not always be able to runner-runner straight my way out of trouble!  &nbsp;

      Man I suck! I pissed away my 900, and now I am back at $660. What a maroon! I went on a major tilt. Was down as low as 300, and then went to 10/20 and played for a while and made it back. I did very well at 10/20. I had my full stash in there. I caught a flush on the river that payed out nicely. The pot odds were there. Everyone yelled at me again! I had 4 to a flush going in, and people kept making the pot odds better for me, so I went for it. The rest of the night I tried to mostly play premium hands. It worked well. Oh well, I am tired and pissed and am going to sleep soon..  &nbsp; I have decided it is best if I do not play 5/10 until my roll is up to like 2000 or more because I cannot handle the downturns. Oh well. Better luck tomorrow. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Ok. Now I am not proud of this play. But my Bankroll took a LARGE leap.  &nbsp;  Seat 1: asharooky ( $227)  Seat 2: Harley50 ( $106)  Seat 3: SirFWALGMan ( $98)  Seat 4: gordini ( $113)  Seat 5: crownjoolz ( $283)  Seat 6: eagle97 ( $177.50)  &nbsp;  BTW - Put ashrooky on your list. He is not a bad player, but he does not respect a flush or straight on the board.  &nbsp;  asharooky&nbsp; posts small blind (2)  Harley50&nbsp; posts big blind (5)  ** Dealing down cards **  Dealt to SirFWALGMan [ Th, Qc ]  SirFWALGMan calls (5)  gordini calls (5)  eagle97 calls (5)  asharooky raises (8) to 10  Harley50 calls (5)  SirFWALGMan calls (5)  gordini calls (5)  eagle97 calls (5)  ** Dealing Flop ** :&nbsp; [ 7d, 8h, Qd ]  &nbsp;  Ok.

The pot was REALLY huge and I figured I would see the river card. I *SHOULD* have never called the raises, but the money in the pot is aewsome. So I hit the runner-runner straight on the river. Now here is where the rest of the people made mistakes. BTW&nbsp;- I am scared of the higher straight, but I am commited now.  &nbsp;  SirFWALGMan checks.  gordini checks.  eagle97 bets (10)  asharooky folds.  SirFWALGMan calls (10)  gordini calls (10)  &nbsp;  ** Summary **Main Pot: $273 Rake: $2Board: [ 7d 8h Qd 9h 6c&nbsp; ]  &nbsp;  SirFWALGMan balance $306, bet $65, collected $273, net +$208 [ Th Qc ]  [ a straight, six to ten -- Th,9h,8h,7d,6c ]  &nbsp;  I have done this twice to people btw.

      A few posts back I asked the question "Raise, Check&nbsp;or Fold". Now, AlCantHang answered my question on his Blog. His answer was "Raise or Fold". He then said something about his wife kicking his butt in poker. Anyway, I took his answer as meaning that he played with aggression. I am normally not a very aggressive person or Poker player, but I have been trying to add this to my game lately. Here is what I have found at the limit games. Aggression Rocks! I now have a policy, if my hand is good enough to stay in, it is good enough to bet. I cannot tell you how many checks I have done, letting people see the next card. Now the only time I will check, is if I am going to fold to any bets ahead of me. I also will play my premium hands with a raise. I normally would just limp into the pot.  &nbsp;  The best place I have seen aggression work (and this does not always work) on several tables is with scary flops or high cards. If I get 33Q on the flop,&nbsp;I suspend &nbsp;all belief and bet on it. Sometimes this works. People will think I at least have the&nbsp;Q because I am betting. I have gotten people to fold MANY times with this. When they do not fold, or raise me I usually back off and fold. This works a lot better once you hit a hot streak and everyone is scared of you. Obviously, it depends on the table too, if people are calling stations, then it will not work on them.  &nbsp;  The other sneaky place I like to try to steal pots is when a few small cards and one large one come on the flop. I bet into it even if I do not have it. At the very least it tells people "He has the High Card". It is the best when the high card pairs up on the turn or river. Nobody is going to want to call you.  &nbsp;  Obviously you need the right cards for these methods to work, but I had a VERY profitable night at 1/2 doing these little things. I played 3 tourneys and lost all 3 for $25, and I am still up almost $50 from my ring winnings.  &nbsp;  So thanks for the advice Al! Maybe I totally mis-interpreted you, but its working for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;  ** Just a little update: I was watching Hollywood Homegame or something like that last night. Howard Lederer was doing commentary. His exact words: "In Poker Agression is good".

      Well, &nbsp; My first Milestone happened last night. I finally cashed out some earnings. I was going to cash out $50 at $500, but then decided to wait until $600 because $500 seemed to take a while.. and then I said, well, lets wait till $650 so I can stay over $600. So here I am.. Fifty in the bank, and $605 or so&nbsp;online. &nbsp; I was on a little bender last night. I do not think it was exactly a tilt, because I would play well, make some money, go somewhere else for some fun, and lose it, then make some more.. I was determined to break even I think! So after several hours I end up $5. Yay BB per hour! &nbsp; High points of the night: &nbsp; Flopped&nbsp;qaud 3's. Played them to the river. Then got someone to cap betting against me on the river, when he made his straight or flush or something. It rocks to flop quads. I have no problem slow playing them. The one time this does not work and I get beat by higher quads is ok with me.  &nbsp; Tried some $25 NL. I was up $25 at my 1/2 table, and figured what the hell. I found it to be rather boring at times. I mean the pots were .50/1 usually. I won a couple all in's, folded a straight because someone put me all in with 2 pair!! Then went all in with a lower two pair than someone else. Pretty much played poorly, but it was fun to try it. I may give it another shot at sometime. I was given the advice to wait .. wait .. wait .. until I have the NUTS and then always go all in, and some dummy would double me up. Guess I got bored waiting.  &nbsp; Took $50 to the 5/10 table after I won it at 1/2. The 1/2 tables were good tonight. Lost the $50 quickly when my straight was beaten by a larger straight. One hole I see in my game is getting suckered in when I *think* I have the NUTS, and some just keeps raising me. I need to slow down and think about what I am doing. &nbsp; Took $100 to the 5/10 tables a few times. At one point in time I had my bankroll up to $700 and proceeded to pee it away! Like I said, I was determined to break even last night. I really should not be playing 5/10. I think I have the skill for Empire 5/10 fishies (I am slightly less fishy I think), but I really do not have the bankroll to sustain a few loses at that level. Once I get to like $2000 I will probably mostly play 5/10. At this rate that should be in about another month.  &nbsp; Took $10 to a tourney game. I went out on my first hand. I had A-10s, and two callers went all in. So I said wtf! That buys me a finish. So I see there cards. It is like KJo, and 55 against me. Not bad! Could I get a freaking Ace to help me? No. Is it just me or do other people always lose money with the premium hands? I cannot tell you how many times I have lost with Big Slick Suited. &nbsp; I find my game is better at 5/10. At least for now. Here is why. I think I play better when I am at least a little scared. I tend to be more patient, wait for more cards, etc.. That is why I think at 1/2 I did well with a $10 stake. Once I get some money under my belt, then I get dangerous. Start seeing flops with K6o, A3o, hey, the last guy won with A high!! Why can't I! I think I have become used to 1/2, so 5/10 is the next logical step once the bankroll is up. I have had probably 15 sessions of 5/10 and would say that 10 of them were positive, and 5 negative. I am probably up 200-300 bucks in 5/10.&nbsp; Hey, I finally found a reason to buy Poker Tracker! I need to know these stats a little better. Remember "Bankroll is not a good measure of how you are doing". Maybe I will buy that puppy now that I am playing more ring games. &nbsp; Guiness and Poker had a picture of a couple of nerd playing poker. One of the nerds (I will call him Big Boned Blue Shirt Guy)&nbsp;looks like a buddy I knew a few years back. It is really funny. His name was Ron D. I wonder if it was him? I could imagine him doing this. We were big computer geeks in school, and played endless computer games, etc.. The next logical move is to Online Poker! Anyway, that would be really funny.. Ron, if your out there, drop me a line! heh. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I know.. I know.. I am over Blogging. I had a really good post for tonight too. But I had to post this! I got a line on  AlCantHang  (Never know if I should put spaces in there somewhere).  Here is is:  "To SirFWALGMan's question about Raise, Bet, or Check? Raise or Fold! (Now do you understand why the wifey is better than me?)"  I am truely honored!

      Not too much to report. Had a decent night session that brought me just over $600, then got killed this morning. Lost $40. I was chasing a little too much. I did get some bad luck also. Sample:  Sir gets QQ55, beaten by QQ66. Damn! I hate that! What are the odds that someone will have Q6 and pair up, when you have Q5 and pair up? Here is an even better one. Sir has 77. Checking into the pot. Flops is 27A rainbow. Sir is doing well! Sir Raises as he should. He is called. 10s comes. No help to anyone. Sir Bets. 1 Guy in Calls. Aces on the river. Sir knows he is beat, but has to call the last bet to keep the guy honest. Whatever the hell that means. Anyway, that was the start of the morning.  So, in my usual tilt fashion, I go to the 5/10 ATM, and put $50 down. Take out almost $130 to get myself back over $600. Not bad. I have got to stop doing that. I would actually like to play 5/10 a little more often because A) It is no harder than 1/2, B) It is more profitable, C) I am crazy, D) All of the above. Anyway, I am not ready to play it regular. Once my stack gets over the 1K mark maybe more often. 2K then sure, why not.   On the nerd front I am thinking of making a web service for Poker Blogs. I spent way too much time going to a Blog only to see it has not been updated! Why oh why have you kept me waiting for a day Felicia!! The whole purpose of this service would be to check every poker blog I read daily, and see when they last updated their pages. It would then spit out an HTML page that had every link, and the last updated date. Possibly another method in this web service would be called with a date parameter and either return the ones that have been updated, or put a nice shiny star by them or something. Anyway, just nerding out and thinking of doing a small project. Anyone think this would be useful?

      Is it just me or is it hard to two table? I like to multitask. I tried it for the first time last week, and had wanted to write something up on it. I kept writing other things though. Maybe I write too much! It my Blog though, so I can ruin it if I want!   Anyway, I think two tables might be the wrong thing for me. I am the guy in the supermarket that gets pissed if you cut in the deli line, even if the line is not well defined. I am the guy who thinks it is extremely rude to drive 65 in the breakdown lane even if it is open. I do not like to make people wait. So, two tabling makes me tense! I am looking at my one table and suddenly the second table blinks. I have to get back there! I am holding people up! What a rude bastard I am! Then my first table starts blinking again! Arg! What to do! I am getting dizzy. Might as well bet my 6 high when there is a flush on the board. No time to look. Cannot think! Down $40 real quick!! Seacreast Out! Am I the only one who gets a bad headache when two tabling?

      I had a nice night at the 1/2 and tourney. I placed 2nd, out, out in 5/1 tourneys. So was ahead by like 3 bucks there. Not so bad. Not so good. The first table I was at I took $20 and made it $50. I did the same on the second table. Or something like that. So now I am up to $582. Going to cash out $50 as a gift once I get to $600. I hear there is a cash out curse, but people have to do it sometime! The second table I was on I did nothing that required skill. I just got AEWSOME cards.

      There is no better feeling than being on a super hot streak. A streak where nothing you do can go wrong. The hands you fold make boats, and the ones you keep make quads. You check on 2-3, and flop a boat! You know you are on one of these super streaks when even the fish start folding any hand you are in. You are a shark like shadow causing them to scurry in all directions. All bow down to the mighty power of SIR!  There is no worse feeling than being on a super cold streak. A streak where nothing you do can go right. Your trips are trumped by higher trips, your quads by a straight flush. Has anyone ever had their straight flush trumped by a Royal Straight Flush? You bet your Rockets hard and crash and burn. The cowboys ride off in the sunset. The Hiltons suck off your pot. The Hookers bleed you dry. You start trying to make something with A-2 because nothing else is coming up. You start playing your cards really slow, which slows the bleeding, but does not stop it. You become scared of every hand you play. Even the fish are feeding on your dead sharky carcass. All come and feed on the mighty SIR!  I prefer the average nights. You have your “A” game going on. You make the right decisions. Figure out when to lay down, when to bet more. Your pile fluctuates a little, but steadily it starts climbing, and before you know it your walking away with a nice pot. All come and watch the game played the way it should be.

      Anyone have any good guidelines on raising bets. I have up until now slow played alot of my hands. Especially AJ, AQ.. even AA! I would always bet AA, but not always raise it if I was bet to. I also was leary of re-raising a bet.   How do you bet A-10+, A-10+ suited, K-10+, K-10+ suited, Q-10+, Q-10+ suited, J-10+, J-J-10+ suited. How about 10+ pairs, 9 or less pairs? Suited Connectors? Un-suited? Do you raise any, raise to 2 bets, check, fold? How much does position effect this for you? Any good articles around?  I tried to be more aggresive tonight with mixed results. I lost my first $20 on a 1/2 table after going up and down alot. I was up like $20 at one point, and then got sucked out on the river for a huge bet. I probably should have slowed down as the bets were being capped on each level. The #&**&$ that got me had nothing except and inside straight draw until the river. ** Oh wait, I did that to someone once, $200 pot, hmm **. Anyway the second table I went to was MY table. WHATEVER I played came out. The first 6 hands I played were something like Flush, Flush, Boat, 3 Kind, 2 Pair. I folded 4-2 and  it flopped 4-4-3. I turned my $20 into $70 in about 10 minutes, and then left. It was getting late, and I was happy with the pot. The guys at the table were scared though. I had 4 to a flush on the turn and everyone folded out to my bet.  So my aggresive betting was mixed results, and too few hands to make much of. Hence, the search for information. I beleive I need to be more aggresive. Mixed results on handling losing too. I was going to stop at

      "The single greatest key to winning in poker is knowing thy enemy — yourself." Andy Glazer  Grabbed that from Guiness and Poker. Excellent writing there. Although it is REALLY long. Anyway, that Andy guy could really sum things up. I have been thinking about my Poker playing lately. I think I am being a little hard on myself. I mean lets get real. I have been playing for about two months. Of course I have an inflated opinion of myself.   As I nursed my $50 up to $500 I thought "I cannot lose", "I am the best poker player of my generation". Ha! What it really says is I am a young poker player. Sometimes I am on my game, sometimes not so much. I am prone to making mistakes, and even one big mistake can kill you in a ring game or tourney.   It is nice to get back to earth. I hope to keep improving my game. I hope to get used to variance. Everyone gets it. Just because I did not see much of it on my rise (ha!), does not mean I am not going to have off times. So anyway, I need to keep playing, and keep trying to manage my money correctly.  One bad thing about internet Poker is it feeds my personality way to much. I was always that nerd kid, playing games in his dark basement for hour-upon-hour, Doom, Quake, Half Life, Warcraft! I would spend hours playing these games, literaly until my hand cramped up and I had to stop. Not sure what void I am trying to fill here, but that is another Blog. I think online poker has the same draw as video games. The money does not seem real. Need to play until I beat the game. Just a thought. It is kind of funny how Poker really makes you think about yourself, and the inner workings of people in general. Dr Freud signing off.

      I have to tell you all, I am a tilt machine. I need to take a break from poker or something. Did my big yo-yo thing again. Took my $500 down to $200, and then back up to $500. Nice, huh? Anyway, I will say I have no fear of moving up to 5/10 once I have a bigger banroll. I have had 10 sessions at 5/10 and only lost during 2 of them. The others I have made between $100 and $300 each session. I really like 6 seated $10. I have a good plan in it. I play conservativly, and do not get drawn into bidding wars. I actually got drawn in a couple of times, and my flushes were beaten by houses. This caused massive drains to my winnings.   My sister got bailed out by her neighbor. I guess it might be interesting to let you all know why my sister deserves to do at least a little time, or hard labor. heh. She has always been a theif. She stole money from my parents. She stole my credit card number from her birthday gift, and ran up a grand. This is a 33 year old woman with a child who only moved out like 3 years ago. My parents have done nothing except bail her out everytime. I pressed charges against her, and got the charges taken off of my account. My parents paid the money back for her. Anyway, now she skipped a court date, so had a warrent out on her. The police called my parents house and told her to come down. They then booked her. I think the best thing for her would be like 6 months in jail or something.. but we will see..   Anyway, I am tired, dissapointed, and going to get some sleep.

      Had a good session. Not too tilty. I think I really HATE losing, and go on tilts more because of this than anything else. It is not the money. The $450 that I have made so far is like a days work for me, so it is not that. I decided to cool off a little and play a few 5/1 tourneys. The good thing is I get to play for a decent amount of time, and I do not risk much. Came in 3rd three times and out of the money once. So not too bad. Then took like 10-15 out of the 1/2 tables.  On a different note, my sister took a huge gamble and lost. I am not sure about the details, but she ended up getting arrested last night. She has always done what she wanted, without regard to anyone else, so I am not surprised she was arrested. It was just a matter of time. My parents have always bailed her out of these situations. They basically could not come up with the $250 bail. Her best friend would not lend it to her, so her neighbor bailed her out. Good lesson to you parens out there -- if your kids do something wrong, do not bail them out, it will teach them not to be jerks the rest of there lives.

      Man.. I am such a freaking tilt head. Here are the shamefull details. So, I am going on full tilt. Lost like $80. So stayed up most of the night, lost some more, went to sleep.   Played alot this morning. Got some of it back, then lost alot. I then wasted $50 in a 5/10 ring game. Lost that. So I take $100 and try again. I am now down to $200 from my original $489. So I am playing, getting frustrated, nothing is working. So I call 3 raised with a J8c. I mean that is a FULL tilt move! Thirty bucks brings me down to $40 left. Flop comes 5c6h7h. So I have 4 to a straight and 3 to a flush. Bet. Raise. I put my $20 in like a FULL TILT IDIOT! Next card 10c. Ok. Four to a flush, four to a straight. Looking better. I already put my full $100 in. WTF. I do not care at this point. I call. Down to my last $10. BAM! Hit my straight on the river!!! Bet. Raise. Raise. Everything is in. I beat AA with J8c. You have NEVER heard so much swearing. In that one 3 way pot, I made $240, and got back to $440. If I was in a live guy, the guy with AA would have jumped over the table and torn my head off. I know I did the wrong thing, and just by shear luck got paid off, but I was laughing my ass off. What a fish I am becoming! Although, I have to say, if you have a single pair, and people are betting into you and not stopping, well, a pair is just a pair. I could have just as easily gotten 2 pair and beat him.   Anyway, this week I am going to focus only on discipline. Do not care if I win or lose. I will bet $10 per day. When it is gone I will stop. I really hate losing. I have to get used to the fact that I am going to lose. Some weeks are going to be better than others, and I need to keep things in control.

      I just realized that something I do leads towards tilts. I have received advice from Sloe and Chris that make sense. The way I have been betting is taking like $10, putting it in, trying to make something of it, and if I do not I buy in again.. now, when I am on a tilt, its just like 10 more.. 10 more.. 10 more.. which is REALLY bad as the tilt gets into full gear. I think I will start taking $40, and putting it all in, and when that is over then my 1/2 play is over for the night. I think $40 is enough for me to see how I am doing.  Anyway, had a better night so far. Made like $30 at the 1/2 tables. I am probably gonna play a little later when the kids are sleeping. Up to $449. Seem to be able to make about $50 a day at the 1/2's. I still want to do Tourneys because the WSOP is every Internet players fantasy!  One last thing on tilts. There is a nice article series on Tilts, and how to notice someone is on one, and take advantage! Also, how to keep away from them.. It is by Alan Schoonmaker who does alot of posts in the 2+2 psycho section. Not sure what I think about poker Psychology but it was a good read.    Alan Schoonmaker Articles

      I HATE the tilt! It makes me feel like a 2 bit hooker with a bad heroin addiction. No offence to any 2 bit hookers with bad heriod addictions who might be reading this. Man did I have a bad night. The worst part about it is I am up $40. I have gone one three tilts in my short Poker career so far, and came out even or ahead on all three. I know this cannot last. I have the symptoms of the worst tilt. Deteriorating play, moving up levels to try and win it all back, etc.. etc.. I was thinking I was getting this part of my game under control to. I just could not stop last night.   Anyway the quick recap. It was a weird night. I was playing 1/2, and losing badly, and then playing worse. Talk about a fish! It was not all on bad calls. I had 2 boats beaten by higher boats, played some hight pairs to the river for some decent loses. I never really know how far to take a high pair. They seem to lose for more more often than not. I was the ATM tonight. I dropped $40 in like 2 hours. Also, I had the Hilton Sister twice. Know what those biatches did to me? Killed my cable connection! I swear it was spooky. The connection went out 3 times last night, twice in a row when I had the Hiltons! I should have gone to sleep the second time.  Anyway, losing $40 is probably not too bad. I then proceeded to have my best session every at 1/2. I turned my $10 into $110 in about an hour. Go! Go! So then I tell myself, "Let's cap it at $90 if I start losing". Ha! 80? Ok. 70? Well, $50 sucks, need to keep playing, ..40.. 20 .. 6.52.. 0? DAMN! Now is the time to REALLY tilt. I am down to $323, so I go and play some 4/6 for a while. Up to $60, lose it all. So I take $100 and go play some 5/10. Now I need to say I hate playing 10 sided, and love playing with 6 people. I seem to do much better, probably because the pace is faster, and smaller good hands hold up better. Needless to say, the 5/10 games have alot of fishies too. I ended up $220 in a very short time. Once my stack gets to $1000 I think I am going to take another $100 and see what I can do with it in 5/10. Probably want to have a good size bankroll before I play it regular.  End result I made like $40 last night, but it is the worst $40 I have made in my short Poker career. I wish I was down $20 instead.

      So, as my self obsessed, nerd, wanna be the best type personality tends to do, I start checking out the old search engine for my Poker Blog. I start with the easiest search that could possibly come up, SirFWALGMan. Zing. Several Hits. Ok, so there just links to posts I have made on 2+2, Sloe and the Fat Guy.. but what the hell. At least it came up!  Let's try MSN and see what happens there. Pretty much the same thing. Same sites. Maybe a few less. Ok. Not so promising yet. Then I go to Yahoo! the best of the Search Engines -- and there it is "Online Poker Thoughts" the SirFWALGMan site! Number one baby! When all of those surfers out there do a search for FWALGMan there going to get me! Ya Baby! I can see the Amazon royalties coming in.  Rising high like I just his quads in a huge pot, I decide to try a more robust search sentence. "Online Poker Thoughts". I mean someone *MIGHT* type that in a search engine, right? BAM! Number one again! Woo Hoo! I am doing so well. I can bet anything now.  Obviously, here comes the tilt. I try a search for "Online Poker Blog". So Im like 10 pages in, still no Sir.. well .. maybe 20? Nope. 100? Ok, I am not THAT pathetic. Anyway, nice to see my Blog come up somewhere in the world.

      It seemed to me, looking through all the Poker Blogs today, that the type's of people writing Poker Blogs are somewhat similar. I counted at least 4 IT people (including myself), MANY MANY evil empire Yankee fans. *grumble* .. like beating Red Sox Fans better .. *grr* Probably my sample size is too small, but it was kind of interesting.   For you IT nerds out there, I was messing with an BHO today in C#. A BHO is a Browser Helper Object. Someone was paying me to design the framework of one for him, so I made one that increases the size of all Image Borders on every page I visit. It is very annoying, but cool also. Go figure. Now if I made all the images replaced by a nude [fill in the blank sexy person] then that would be really nice! Or maybe make everything beer? The sexy thing sounds like a really good joke on the boss if I quit someday. He would NEVER be able to browse again. That would rock! *evil* .. *taking* .. *over* *body* *must* .. *resist*.  Anyway, had a short session this morning. It has been great. My daughter has been waking me up at 6AM, and that gives me a good hour to play. Just pop the bottle in her mouth, and come up in an hour when I need to shower and go to work. Picked up another $20 this morning. I am looking forward to when my $50 finally becomes $500. It has taken about a month, maybe slightly more. After losing $200 while trying to learn the game, it is exciting to be doing well. When I hit $500 I am going to take my $50 out as a reward. Do not want to lower my bankroll by any substantial amount, but would like to see something come out. Anyway, will keep you posted. I think my next thing to try is playing multiple tables. The 1/2$ games all seem profitable, and you do not have to think that much, so why not 2 tables.. then 4.. see how it goes. Hope empire allows this. Oh well.

      I want to thank Chris for his advice. It was excellent. He said that I should probably be going into these games 1/2 with $50. For now, I am going to ignore his advice, but he is absolutely right. The reason I am going to ignore him for now is my system is working well. I am having AEWSOME results.   I put $10 in tonight and made it $66 as we speak in like 10 minutes. The best hand of the night. I am just calling my middle pair along because people are letting me. I have K2d. The flop is a diamond. Ok. Everyone checks. Next card is a diamond. Someone finally bets. I say what the hell. Pot is nice. River is a diamond. I bet. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. All the way to full and I take a nice $40 pot with K high flush. I swear you cannot lose on these tables. You guys should come by and play with me (or at least watch).  I am hoping to put my pot over $400 tonight. Will keep you updated.  Just called AK down to the end with a pair of A's. Raising all the way to the river. Up to a 28$ pot. A lot of stress with one pair, but I figured it might stand up at these tables. Up to $68.30. Ok, you can lose a few hands here. That is why my $28 only got me up a buck. Oh well.  I have a pet hand now. It is 5-3. Also 7-2 is nice whenever I get it. 5-3 has given me a Boat and 2 Pair, and some big wins.   This table is like my ATM machine. I enter some numbers, sit around for a few minutes, and take some cash out. Really nice. If you every see jazzstepa, go to his table. He is a betting/calling station. Has paid me off well. I know whenever I check him, I am going to get bet against. Also, he is not going to consider anyone having better cards than him. If he has middle pair, he is betting all the way to the river. Of course I just lost to his AK.. oh well, A8 was not a great call. It was suited. Down to $52. Going to leave if I hit $50. Only problem with an EASY table is you start playing down to there level.   Just got beaten by 5-3 on the river. See, this is a powerfull hand. Does it have a name? Payback. Open ended straight landed. Decent pot. Only one guy calling me to the river. How do you call at the river with high card A? Not sure. Oh well.   I think jazzy is going to give me one last huge pot. I have that feeling.  Folded 5-3 by accident. 4 to a flush.. 5-3 makes the flush on the river! Now I am convinced that 5-3 rocks!! How to tell a table sucks -- Nobody ever folds on the flop. My man jazz called K6 on the river, with Aces on the board. WTF! He actually did win that one.   Made $22 on trip 6's. That was nice. Went on a little tilt. Hate playing down to the fishes level. Down to $44. Should leave. Waiting for one more monster hand. Folded A2, that would have killed a J4. Each of us had 2 pair. Oh well. Ended up at +30$ for the session. Not so bad. Kept chasing crap towards the end. So with my minus $10 for a tourney, I am up $20 for the night.  Just wondering for other people playing .50/1 or 1/2, what do you usually take in a night, playing between 2-5 hours?

      I was reading all of the posts about Andy Glazer passing away. I had never read anything by him. I went by http://guinnessandpoker.blogspot.com, and they had an article posted there. Very good reading. The guy was an excellent writer and knew his poker if nothing else. I wish his family the best.

      Someone tonight was trying to tell me that my flush call was bad tonight. I made the flush on the river. I could have been beat by 2 cards, AQ of Spades if that made a flush. The pot was $25 which is 12xBB. So I had 12xBB vs 4-1 odds to make my flush. I can see how someone would think this was a bad bet. It is most definatly not. The reason for this -- over the LONG run I am going to make my flush 1 of 4 times. So, if I am making 12 times by bet for the flush, I am going to be up over the long run. It is very important in limit Hold Em to see what the pot odds are. If you do not understand this then you should not play. I hate when people try to give me bad advice. Anyway, I ended up another $30 on 1/2$. I was up 47$ at one point. Probably should have left, but I was kinda pissed at mister advice.. so I decided to give him 17 bucks back. Good call. Oh well. I am still learning to curb my emotions.

      I am playing still. I started out slowly. Lost 1/2$ for $20. Placed 3rd and lost a 5/1 tourney. I then went to fish heaven. I mean A high calling my flush. I took $10 and made it $80 at one point, then sunk it to $70 before I left. Not bad for a night of 1/2. I just could not lose. It was one of those nights where you play 7-2 as a joke, and win! Every single time! I am very happy with my 1/2$ strategy. I take $10 and play it as long as I can. If I go out, I might buy in again for another 10 at a different table. If I get to 40 bucks, I cap my loses back off at $30. I then increase the bottom level for every extra 10$ I win. It has been a good strategy so far. Anyway, I am in a $10 Tourney now. Figure I would blow some of my winnings. If I have a good night tomorrow, I am going to try some 2/4 or 3/6 for a few hands (same strategy, but with $20 or $30 instead of $10). I will keep you posted on the results.

      I think my tourney play has suffered recently as my ring game has gotten better. I think this is because the two are diametrically opposed. Now, the same kind of play, going in with good starting cards, etc.. works in both, but I think in tourneys you need to screw pot odds and think survival. I might be wrong about this. It seems though, that when I play more aggressively, I end up losing more in tourneys. In a ring game, it might be a good bet to try and draw out a flush, and take a large pot. In the long run you will win more. In a tourney, it might just cripple you enough to lose it all. When I play very conservatively in tourneys I almost always finish top 3. I loosen up when it gets down to the 3 final players, but it seems like playing super tight until the end pays off more often than not in the single table tourneys.    On the other hand, I think that ring games are FAR more profitable than tourneys. I can take out 10-50 a session in a 1/2 ring right now, where it might take a while to do that in tourney play. I do not think I will give up on tourneys. There is something to be said about being BIG DOG, numero UNO, better than the other 9 players! As far as making money though, I am going to focus on the rings more. Once I get my pot up a little I will probably move up to 2/4 or 3/6. I think my pot is a good size for 1/2. Not sure what the guidelines about this would be, but I want to take it slowly, especially until I get my desire to TILT way out of control out of the way.

      Had a really nice morning. Up $56 in one session of 1/2. Best session of 1/2 I have had yet. Everyone at my table would call any pair down to the river and jump right in. I got lucky getting several flush and trip friendly flops that worked out. I got into the zone and pissed someone off. I had 45h, and made the flush at the river. The only reason I was in against his AKo was because I was up so much, and was going to leave, so wanted one more pot. It feels good when your on a lucky streak and cannot lose.  On another note, why do people get sooo mad about poor/bad play in 1/2$ Hold Em? Do you not expect people to call things to the river? Play badly. Raise crap? Why do you yell at someone who made his runner-runner flush when A) He had pot odds, and B) It's only 4 bucks to see it until the end? I really get annoyed when people in 1/2 get mad at bad play. It is to be expected by a percentage of people there. I always jab people who do this as much as possible. Especially when they lose with their J high awesome hand!

      I think my game is staying the same. I basically win, loose, go on huge tilts, win it all back, etc.. I would be satisfied if my play became more consistent, and also if I could stop going on tilts and loosing alot of cash. I have been lucky to win it back.  One thing I read in a book "Over a short period of time it is luck, over a long time it is skill". It seems to me that the internet is MADE for luck. I can log into the computer, play a few hands of poker (1/2, whatever), risk $10, double it up on my one good hand to $20, cash out, and go home. If I play a decent safe game I am usually going to get a good hand before my first $10 gets chewed up, and be able to double up or more. Since I do not have to drive anywhere to do this, I can consistently make some money. Anyway, something to think about.

      Well, another bad night. Lost about $20. Back down to $238. I played a tourney where I was the large stack. $3000 to everyone else being $600-$1000. I promptly blew this and went out like 5th. I was trying to add some aggresiveness to my game, but I think I chased a few things too far. I also kept getting raised all in when doing a larger than normal bet by the guy after me. This was aggrevating. I did not want to go $800 against him, and become short stacked, but I had some hands where I probably should have taken the chance. This is gambling, is it not?   I played some 1/2$ ring stuff too. I see why the ring play pays off more, and also can lose more. I find the hardest thing to do is to keep waiting for premium hands. I see sooo many people all in until the end, and taking the pot, with Ace high, and other assorted crap, when straights and flushes are on the board that I start playing down to my competition, and get nailed when someone does have the nuts. If I play my game I think I can do well in ring games. I look forward to when I have enough bank to play 5/10$ regualarly, because at least on Empire, the level of play still sucks.  My biggest weakness lately I think is chasing junk and thinking it is good. Pair of aces to the river, with people calling every bet. One pair does not make a great hand.

      I had a great night. Did not win much. Only $23 playing tourneys. However, my play was excellent. I was in each game until the end. I decided to quit after 2 tourneys to show a little self control. I placed 1st and 3rd in my two tourneys. The 3rd place finish was a good one. The big pot played SOO well. He was AGGRESIVE. Once he had a huge stack lead he would not let you see a flop for less than $500. Since everyone was 400-700$ stacks, he was able to take alot of pots away. It also made people feel like if they had anything they had to go up against him. He had alot of luck too. Made straights and flushes on the river, etc..  The second game, I only played the premium hands. I steadily went up, was able to fold some big pots when it mas marginal, and ended up large stack at the end. The second stack and myself kept going at it. Finally I called on 89s and caught an 8 and 9 on the flop. His night was over.  I did not win much, but I am happy with my play, and how I managed my chips, and leaving while I was up.

      MAN! What a tilt!! I started playing. I lost tourneys, 1/2, .50/1, everything. I finally get down to my last $100. So like an IDIOT, I go and play $5/10. Anyway, I met up with a total jerk, took like $100 from him. Got a few good hands. And Walla -- I am back to $230. I really need to control myself. I have a bankroll of $230, so I probably should have a goal of using 10% a night. So 4 5$ tourneys. 2 10$. Something else. Whatever. Just keep the losses down to about $20 a night. Of course when I am doing well I can keep winning as long as I want.  Just some notes on the $5/10. It is a mixed bag on Empire. I had the jerk guy yelling at me because I called him with 2's on the river. Now he had nothing. He was going for a straight, but putting $100 into a pot for a possible straight call, when I was checking you down to the river is just plain bad, am I right? The $5/10 on Empire at least does not seem to be very challenging. It seems like the same rules. Limit your losses. If you do not have the nuts, then consider bailing out. Push in as must money as you can when you have the nuts. There were some good players in $5/10, but basically it was just people calling with Aces high nothing.

      Just a quick post today. Had a decent session last night, albeit short. I played from 10:30-12:00. I did two $10/1 tourneys. I got 2nd and 5th. Not too bad. I went all in with a pair of Q’s on one game, and got 4 of a kind. That was a nice touch. I then played a .50/1$ and lost $5. So at this point I was up about 3 bucks. I then tried 1/2$ again, since I did so well last time. The 6 player format really appeals to my game. I won about $24 playing. I flopped two flushes, which was nice, although I lost on one to a boat.  I was reading the local BLOGS and came across an interesting article about the stages of  urlLink  poker playing and growth  .  Interesting stuff. I am definitely thinking I am probably around stage 2. I have huge swings still, go off on tilts all the time, but at times play well and generally stay ahead. I really enjoy the times I can feel the game and dominate it.

      It was a bad night. I blew over 100 bucks. Back down to $305 or so. Sucks. Oh well. Rebuilding again. I could not catch a card if my life depended on it. At least I did not go up levels. That is something.

      I used to be eighteen years old. It was a good time. I was young and stupid. I had the memory of an Elephant. In computer class I was the guy who was “Sorry teacher but the correct scale of a double is 1.81673+e15 not 1.81672+E15”. I have since become wise instead of smart. I do not know the precision of a double anymore but I know how to find out. I may not remember every fact, tidbit, and bit of data but I know how to negotiate for a good pay rate. I know my memory may not be as good at 35, but my use of that knowledge is much better.  Now to set the record straight I called a $3 raise with an 8-3 of diamonds. I then proceeded to make worse calls all the way down to the river. Once I hit the river I made the only good choice with my flush: Raising my remaining .40 cents.  I will tell you all right now though, I do not write down my poker hands. I tend to write this Blog freestyle, saying what is on my mind. The only accurate hands you will ever see here are my live tourney reports. If you are depending on me for great poker advice please read someone else. I bet many of the Bloggers out there can give you better advice. I have been doing this for two months.   If you want total accuracy please read the New York Times.. check that, “Free Kevin Mitnick!”.. umm.. the Boston Globe or some newspaper like that. I am sure they have many editors that check the facts out.  All I promise to provide here is entertainment and my personal view of how my Poker career is going. For the most part I write the Blog for internal reflection. I hope you find my trials and victories inspiring or amusing. I hope some of them get you to think about poker concepts. Perhaps a few might give you a nice push in the right direction. If you require 8 degree decimal precision the 18 year old version of me would be glad to help, but the current edition does not see the need. I hope you all enjoy what I write.

      The Blog Roll was getting too large to cycle through in a normal day. I have now split it between Blogs I read every day, and the ones that I get to on days like today. The entire company is on a picnic, and consultants are not invited. I still need to be here to support my application(s) and do some java thingies but I can Blog more. If your not in my reading list too bad. It does not mean your Blog is not worth reading, it either means you update too infrequently or you just got added and I have no opinion of your site yet.   On such site I have not read enough of yet is Poker on Film. The posts I have read so far are excellent and I enjoy them. It will probably make my list sometime soon. For some reason I like reading how people play hands. It is amusing and informative. Sometimes much more so than reading a book.   I am pissed at my best buddy. His home game was going to be my first live experience since I started playing poker alot. I have been waiting for over two months for this game and he schedules it while I am away. Jackass. Oh well. I guess my live game will have to wait. I still think I am a walking tell so maybe this is a good thing.  I am going to start trying more of the 2-5K NL and limit tourneys. You cannot beat an ROI of $6 to win $2500. If my rate remains consistant it would take me 2.5 months to win $2500. Hopefully my rate increases, but you get the point. It would be nice to take one of the decent sized tourneys for a few hundred bucks!  I am getting ready to go on vacation. I start this Thursday. I will be Pokerless and Computerless which is bad, but I will be soaking in the sun and getting a much deserved break from the grind of work and Poker.   Not to whine or anything but my typical Monday goes like this. Spend 8 hours at the day job. This can be fun or boring depending on how much work I can scare up and what type of work it is. I enjoy doing the Java stuff since it is sort of new. I tend to be a Microserf in some ways, my main languages being C# and Visual Basic, but I also love Tech and like to do new things. It causes me to be a Generalist which is good in a downturn when people want to hire someone who can do it all. Once I spend my eight here I go to my two day a week night job. The job was originally a start-up where I was anything from CTO to lowly grunt. I was working 80-100 per week for the promised payout. One note: If you are going to be in a startup get something in writing first. I was way burnt out. The only good part of the job is I was making consulting rates and getting full time benefits. The company then decides that it wants to average out salary and I need to take a 26K pay cut or leave by the end of the month. Now I had done a lot for this company but no way was I working 100 hours and taking a pay cut!! I was kind of worried about finding a job. I got lucky and got a job with the last place I contracted with in about a day. I then went to my boss and said “Cya”. No notice. Nothing. Bite me. It is amazing in life as in poker how the tone changes when the balance of power shifts. I was now the Big Stack. He backtracked on everything he said and tried to guilt me into believing he did not mean any of it. You have to understand, I spent a year of my time building every system they made and now I was going to disappear into the ether. I told them I would work nights to help them out for a while. So I was pulling down 4K a month from them, and making a good rate during the day. I have since scaled back to two nights a week and around 2K on a good month. Once I get home from the night job it is time for the Poker Job. I get to play Monday and Thursday nights. The wife is getting mad at me playing all the time. I am trying to scale back down to Monday and Thursday but it is hard. I really enjoy playing.   So there you have it. A typical day in my life. I am REALLY looking forward to resting a little. It will be hard to not play any poker for a week, but I can probably do it. I am vacationing like 20 minutes away from AC soooo... I will have to let you know.

      This is the Poker Gods Revenge post, or tribute to vanburenUCB. Now those of you who read my posts often will remember I was trying to get into a 25K tourney. I was dealt AA and got sucked out by a flush draw even though I bet HEAVY into the hand before he made the draw. I was kind of pissed about this. Ok fast forward to earlier this afternoon. I am watching the kids and playing some 25NL. I have mixed feelings about 25NL. It is probably because I am not very good at it. If I have patience I do well, if not I will call alot of potential bluff hands and lose. For me it is more a game of luck. VanburenUCB is to the right of me. I beleive he raised the pot slightly and I call him with J-10 soooted. I do tend to be a bit of a flush runner. The flop is all rags, BUT two diamonds. I check.  VanburenUCB makes the correct move and bets $5. I think a while and call. I was up a little and wanted to see another card. Next card is a rag. VanburenUCB KNOWS I am on a flush draw and wants to knock me out. He bets $10 on the hand. Now I think really hard. I say to myself "This is a horrible call but I am going to make it.". Bam Baby! Diamond on the river and flush running river rat Sir beats .. you guessed it .. AA! Poker is weird. I was beat on AA with a Diamond flush draw a few days ago, and I beat someone with the exact same draw today. I appologized to VanburenUCB. Several times. At the time (I think) he was so mad at me he did not say a word. Either that or he was stunned by my bad play since he reads my blog. At least he was still up. Later in the night he caught me playing a little more solid on a .50/1 table and told me I owed him his own post. I agree.

      I have been reading again and decided to make an adjustment to my NL tourney game which seems to be a +EV proposition. I was reading the Texas Holdem book listed in my book section by Brad Daugherty and Tom McEnvoy, and read the part about short stack. I really like anything Tom McEnvoy writes. He has a simple way of explaining things that is good for starting out. I have usually tried to "Stay in the game" when I become short stack. The book suggests this is incorrect play. The adjustment it says I should make is if I am in critical stack position if I am going to bet, I should just go all in. Here is a portion of the chart:   Round       Move In Stack 1           50 2           100 3           150 4           250 5           500 6           750   I could go on. The only point I am making here is that when you have that few chips and the blinds are a decent size you MUST risk it all to have a chance to win it all. I played 5 tourneys today to test this. I placed in 4 of 5. Two of these I would have been blinded out or made little money if I did not go all in with a good yet move in stack left. I doubled and tripled up in a tourney this way from a $450 stack at 5th level with six people left! I ended up in second place. Not bad. Normally I would have made small bets and maybe made a little money. So all of NL tourney guys out there be prepared to GO .. ALL .. IN!

      I had one of the most amusing 10/1 NL sessions ever. If I was having a little less fun I would have come in 1st place. Basically I put someone out on the first hand. I was then joking and playing around with people on the table, and promptly lost some more, won alot more, and lost the rest. Oh well. It was only 10/1 NL.   The good thing about tonight is I capped $400 so I am in the green again. It feels good. I had two nice $25NL sessions and a $5/1 NL 1st Place win to do it. I also made $10 at a .50/1 table. I really want to get to $600 and start playing some $1/2. I am making sure I stay within my limits. I think that 300xBB is a good metric and I am not going to play higher tables until I have the money.  The Patriots are kicking the Eagles butts! Ya Baby! It is going to be a good year me thinks.

      Poker Distraction started up a Blogger FFL. Fantasy Football League for those of you who do not know. I have never participated in one of these things, but figured it might be fun. I am already being called a liar and a windbag and the season has not even started yet:  "SirFWALGMan has decided to join the fray in the FFL. He says he's never played, but is a fan. He could be sandbagging... we'll see. Either way, I've added a link to his blog on the right, it's "Online Poker Thoughts", go check him out. He posts very frequently... and frequently posts long."  - Roberto Roundtree Rogelio    Poker Distractions  Now I might not care too much about Fantasy Leagues and all of that even if I love football. One think that is important to me though is winning! Yes! I think this has alot to do with why I like Poker. I think I have a good chance of being a consistently good and winning player. So I spent the end of today scouting out a team. From what I understand you need like 2 QB's, 3-4 Receivers, 3-4 Running Backs, a Tight End, a Kicker and two defenses. I do not know how many people you get to take overall maybe these are the limits? If Roberto is reading this maybe he can fill me in. I have chosen 9 defenses, 7 QBs, 15 RBs, 8 TEs, 14 WRs, and 6 Kickers that I like so far and ranked them in order. Hopefully this is enough of a pool to make a team from? If I need some more let me know.  The only other useful information I have figured out so far is that you should pick your running backs early in the draft. You MUST have two good RBs to succeed. I will continue my research. I probably will not do a full post again because this IS a Poker Blog, but you might get it slipped in every once in a while especially if I am crushing my opponents! Die Pagan Scum!   I like my choices so far and hope that I can get one of the choices I have made. It is the only one I really want. I am not going to say who it is, but I am going to get it as quickly as possible without jeopardizing my team. Wish the Boston Bullets luck this year! See I tied Poker into this post after all.

      Possitive affirmations as Sloe would say. I started warming up for the NL tourney to get into the 25K NL tourney by playing some $25NL. I was up to $70 at one point, and ended at $50. I had 99 and was raised $43 on a $6 raise I did. The guy has A4 offsuit, but I was not going to go away from my warmup table a loser for any reason. A $25 profit on the night is decent at my bankroll level. The table was incredable passive. I would try to bet .50 on my straight draws and everyone would fold. Thank God initially there was a maniac ATM machine who called me all in when I had a REALLY high flush. Not the ace, but it was good enough.   Now on to the NL tourney:  Round 1: 193 entrants. $965 prize pool. 8.7 entries into the 25K NL tourney on Sunday. If I win that one I am cashing out 15K. 10K for the wife to buy furniture (this will get her to stop nagging), 5K for savings, the other 10K is my working bankroll. What are my chances of winning? As good as anyone else I would say. Our table starts with 9 players. I am taking it easy. Getting crap cards also. The first  person has already gone out on our table. I like NL! I just bet $60 to try and steal a pot. Everyone stayed in. This is going to be a good table if I can keep my excitement down. Down to 192 players now. Sweet. Pair of 4's for me the SB. Nothing on the flop. I lay it down. Good thing because the J's just trippled up. Not to mention the flush on the river. The eight high flush takes it. I LOVE this table. K9 on the button. Three hearts on the flop. Ouch. Folding. Folding to a $125 bet. Too early. Too much. It is down to 186 left. I am slightly below average stack. Being a little more aggresive. Probably want to take it easier. The top 11 pay off, with the top 8 getting the entry into the Sunday Tourney.  Level 2: Start with $865. No luck so far. Not a big deal though. I will make my moves when it is time. I am used to starting with $800 usually, so the extra is like winning a hand. Called $60 with KJ and the flop is 234 garbage that makes A6 a straight. I am out. AA. Pocket Pair. A jackass calling J7d to the river when I raised him $800 before the river. Man I am pissed.  So I play 2 $25 NL's and 1 10/1 NL after I get these lousy cards. My luck does not improve. I dropped $52 in a short period of time. Really not good. My stack which was doing well from my NL limit is back to $316. I then go on the most incredable run of cards I have ever had. I was double tabling and ran my $25 in .50/1 up to $65, and a $25 NL up to $42. Sweeeet. The .50/1 was the hot table. In less than 1/2 hour I made the 40BB or so. I was dealh 6 flushes draws in a row and made 5 and won the last on a pair made on the river. This is how good this table was. I swear I won 10 hands in a row. It was scary. It is now 12AM so I am trying to leave the table. I just cannot lose so I do not want to leave. I am up to $70.75 since I started typing this. I leave when I lose enough to go under $70. Might get blinded out now! 9-5o on the BB. Folding to a raise. The SB will knock me out next hand unless I win it. 5-9o now. Heh. Scary! And Sir is out with $69.75. Hold on! I am four to a straight! Damn. Would have missed it. heh. Sir is going to sleep.

      I took a night off. It is for the better. Wife is really getting mad at my playing. Sometimes if I am having a losing night I try and stay up until I get even or make a little. I need to stop doing that and just call it a night.  The Poker Gods must have missed me because I have played all of 3 minutes this morning and am up $10 at this point playing .50/1. Not bad. Wish I could make that BB per hour all the time!  One of my readers had a decent idea (Piper_bt). He says and I quote "It would be nice to know some of the Bloggers names on different sites". If anyone wants to send there site names I will either create a new section here to keep track or post them next to your Blog name or something. It is kind of fun to get someone saying "Hey, are you SirFWALGMan from the Blog?"  Tonight is my official Poker night. I have agreed with the Wife to limit myself to Monday and Thursdays and sometimes on the weekend. I am going to play a little NL at 9ish, and then enter the Sunday Night NL Poker Qualifier for one dollar. If I win that I get to try the 25K Sunday Night NL game. It starts a 9:00 on Empire. Anyone who wants to harass me come on down.

      Level 1-3: Kept an even keel. Was up $500 on AA, and a flush caught on the river. I am slightly over average.  Level 4: Got some good cards. Trips. I had Q high and A high, and got called to the river with both. I even had the guys jump in to see my cards. I am now up to $4500.  Level 5: Switched tables. Got KK and got trips on it. Bet it up. Got 1 caller. Ended at $4800. Now back down to $4400 on 55, and some other misses. Blinds are 75/150. Average stack is $2294. High is 8K! 119 left. Top ten get the qualifier and 11-13 get like $10.  Level 6: Blinds are 150/300. No action yet. Playing solid and getting enough cards to stay near the middle of the pack. Folded K2s to a raise. Fours spades on the flop. Red. Red .. and .. Red. Saved alot of money. Can not beleive Q-10 is raising, but maybe I am too passive? 101 left. 12:26AM. The time sucks since I have been up 3 nights in a row to 3AM and worked 19 hours yesterday. Folded A-8. Not interested in going in on anything less than 20 in blackjack right this minute. That might change in a little bit. Only 99 left. A milestone? Have not played a hand this round. Sweet. Two large stacks are beating each other up! One stack just went up to 11K! Get me off this table!!!! KJ beat K6 and I folded K7. Ouch. I told you all, 20 or above in BJ. Blinded down to $4110. Average stack is 3K. I am still in the right area for now. Only 91 left. People are falling like flies. Q-10 in the BB. Folded to me. Only win this round so far.  Level 7: Bet KQ up. AA got a pair of 8's on the board and I am dead. Down to 2K. Aggresion is not always good? Bah! I should have won that!!!! GRRRR!!! I should have slowed down when the 8's showed up too. I did slow down. But it was 2 BB to the river.  AQ suited. Lets see if this does anything besides kick me out of the tourney. Ok. Won $600 on that one. $2385. That last hand pissed me off, but I am not on tilt yet. heh. Deep breaths. I notice sometimes when I have the nuts I forget to see what is going on around me. I need to be more careful before I raise someone. I knew he had Pocket Rockets and I barely even looked to see the 8's until the river. Then I am like... whoooahhhh what am I doing!   "The Hammer" should I play it. Probably. But I cannot afford the fighters. Crappy flop for 27. What a surprise. Only seventy five people left out of the original 270.  Q7 suited. Was going to play but got raised. Flop sucked for it anyway. I have suited connectors. I have a good feeling about these. 7 and 8 of spades. I had four to a straight but nothing happened. I probably could have stolen it. I just got four flush draw cards in a row. Passed on all of them. Not chasing it right now.  Raise A-9. Crappy flop. I have to fold. Win a small pot with K9 suited. Take someone out. Down to $1400 on a straight draw. It was my blind so no choice. I think I am in trouble. I might be able to get back in it with a good hand. I need to figure out what to do. There are 65 people left and I need to make some money with 200/400 blinds. Damn 8's!!!  My A8 buddy just lost a huge pot. Ha! Does not mean anything if I do not get some chips and stay in longer than him.  Level 8: 300 and 600!!! Damn! I am out in like a few rounds if I do not get cards.  Waiting for a few good cards and I am going to play them and hope for the best. The blind is almost to me. I feel its weight. K4 clubs. Raised. I have a caller! Out of the tourney. I am 60th place and pissed off. Beat by AJ. Damn! Nobody made a single card.   *** UPDATE: Finally found someone on Empire who reads me. Shout out to lich52! He played a decent game of 25NL. Our table had several maniacs to start. I got my stack up to $50 with him there. After taking a big pot from the Maniac, I told him the story about the guy on tilt who I baited into calling me by raising exactly what he had. A couple hands later I get trip Ks and bet 7.01 which is everything he had left. He pauses. Thinks and then calls me. I think he had the J. Another J came on the river giving me the boat just to rub it in.

      No No No it is not me this time my friends. Someone else. I want to show you how evil I really am. I am playing $25NL. The guy to my left has kicked my ass a little, I am down from $50 to $37. I am not too happy with him. Deep breath. Wait for my revenge. He goes all in with AQs. He did not have to do this. The pot was $16 and he had a chance to steal it. Instead one person calls him with K9 and makes KK99. He was extremely pissed. So what does he do besides whine. He goes all in again the very next hand with A10o or something. Good hand yeah. Not as good as 99 when nothing hits though. So 99 brings down a huge pot, and the former $90 big stack is now down to $14. Here is my part. Bahhahahaha! I call a normal .50 bet with 9/5. Actually I think I was the BB. The flop is 9-J-5. Now I know this guy could have JJ but I do not think so. So I decide to tweak him and bet exactly what he has left. I mean I waited .. said to myself "If I bet his exact amount the guy to my right will fold, and he will call me because he is on TIIIIILLLLT!! If anyone recognizes the signs it is me. He played into my hands. Sir is the spider. Making his kill. It makes up for me getting shanked by 2-6 when the flop was 266 then A then J. I went all in like a rube. Idiot! Freaking two pair! Moron! Oh well. I am back to a good number. I am a little over $300 right now. Hope to make it to $325 or so tonight. We will see.   Slow playing KK right now. Raised to $3. Looks good. Flop is A34. Have to fold to a $5 raise. Damn! Oh well. I am hanging in there.   One question to you all. Do you think slow playing monster hands is a good idea? I never bet up my AA, KK, QQ, sometimes maybe QQ or JJ. Never AK suited, AQ suited. I know I can steal $2 pots, but when my flops make it I can be devistating in NL. Anyone have any thoughts on this?  UPDATE: AA played slow. Flops A-3-5. Two aces bets $4. I call. A 5 on the turn to make my boat. He bets $9. I raise. He calls.  Now he is suspicious. Damn! I get two bucks out of him at the end just because of the size of the pot. Nice.  Got sucked out for $6. Was going for Ace High Club Flush!!! Missed it. Oh well.  Still at $68. Just waiting for my 1$ hold em entry into the $5000 friday night tourney. I really would like to be in that!

      The Night started dismal. I was playing .50/1 ring. My A-10 trumped by AK, trips by trips with a higher kicker. I could not make a flush if my life depended on it. I folded a $30 pot. This was a BIG mistake. I had a trip tens. It would have cost me $3 to see it to the end. There was a straight and a flush draw on the board and people were going after me like crazy. In hindsite this was a bad fold, not because I would have won, but because the amount I would have to put in was MUCH less than what was in the pot.   I then decide to try a 10/1 Tourney. I play really careful until five are left and then I make two mistakes. One was calling a big bet pre-flop with a small pair. I told myself not to call any raises and then clicked the button anyway. Had to fold on the flop. The second mistake was when the board flopped QQ6. I had the 6, but someone else had the Q. Bad move on my part calling them. Damn!  So then I played some $25 NL. The deck slapped me in the face. I COULD not miss. 66 became 666. Boats. Flushes. Everything was running for me. One hand I remember and feel sort of bad about. KQ Spades. Flop is A-10-3 spade. One guy bets out three bucks. I type "No way you have it!". I call. Next card is a 6 diamond. He bets out $10, I raise him another $5. He calls. Last card is a 4 of spades. He bets $5 I raise $19, he has the smarts to fold. I felt bad for taunting him, but I guess it worked.   Overall good night. I had a few losing sessions, so I am back under $300 to $295 after tonights wins. Overall I think I am playing well. Not going over my head. Steadily growing my stash. If I have some more good NL sessions I will be up to 1K in no time. Still want to do well in my .50/1 and tourney. I want to try some multi table tourneys. Empire does not have alot to choose from though. The $5/1 is never full when I look.. and the rest are entries to other contests. These are good, but I have to win two tourneys to get anything I think. I may try one of the big ones just for the hell of it. Would be nice to win 50K! heh.

      I was on the craziest most intense Gamboolerz table for three hours last night. It was a hell of a ride. Here are some of the highlights.  Big stack likes to bully people around. He had like $180 and liked to go all in. The flop is AAA and I have KK. I slow played it. I know this is probably stupid, but I have come to the conclusion it is better to trap someone with the absolute nuts, then scare them off with something less. Anyway, the pot was a decent size and he goes all in with Q high. I mean he put his $180 into the middle. I called him with my $40 because I did not believe him and I got lucky and won a huge pot.   He was in another one where he puts his whole pot in against $60. Two other people call. I fold. Freaking $180 pot. The big stack has something like AAKK. The first called had a pair of threes. Not sure what the second guy had. Guess what comes on the turn and river? 33. Heh! He said "I just had a feeling" .. So I stand up for him and say "Well, he had pot odds, he only needs to make his trips one out of 120 times and he is ahead.". Ok. So my math is a bit off but it was like that all night. I ended up about $50 for the night. The people at the table were really nice. We even would warn each other not to go in sometimes when we had the absolute nuts. Not all the time, but on occasion.  I am still up in the air on what I think about NL. I think treating it like a tourney, and only playing one per session is a good idea. I think playing it like a tourney, and waiting for the NUTS is the best strategy. Peeking at pots when it is cheap works too. I let someone limp in for .50, and the flop is 442, and he has 24! Lucky I only lost about five bucks on that one. I vary my strategy, in that sometimes with some people you just have to call without having the absolute NUTS or else they will walk all over you all night long. Other times it is never right to call. It seems like NL is all a game of waiting and good timing and luck. You can get the NUTS and only win a buck, or you can have a pair of twos and win a nice pot. It is definatly a RUSH!!   I am thinking I need to get on Party instead of Empire. I see all of the Bloggers play together on Part and frankly I am jealous. Ok, I am probably not going to play in most of there games.. maybe some of the multi's or something.. but I never get to play against anyone I know!! Wahh Wahh Wahh!

      I want to talk about state of mind a little in the context of Poker. Normally when I play Poker I start out very calm. I might be a little excited to play. Now excitement can be your worst enemy. Have you every felt the little anxious jump? Maybe your leg is shaking a little. Your a bit excite or nervous or jumpy. I think a lot of times this little feeling can spell your doom. It is sometimes a tell of wanting to make things happen. Poker seems very much a game of calm. I suppose this is why many people mention zen and meditation when talking about Poker. Basically I think you need to find your center and wait for the cosmos to give you a turn. Forcing things to happen will cost you. So I am going to take a few breaths and jump back into a nice NL table. I am up like 8 bucks and am waiting for my cards.   Just as a side note: It really sucks when your K high flush gets beaten by A, much better the other way around. Earlier today this happened. I do not think you fold a K high flush in NL, but it still sucks. I was on a table. I got the K high. Someone bets 8 bucks into me, I raise another 8, they go all in, and that's the end of me. Damn! I hate it when the chips are supposed to slide to you and they somehow go the other way, that is disconcerting.

      I made it up over $300. I am now standing at $302. I did this by solid .50/1 play and the deck smacking me in the face until I cried. It started off badly. The cards were cold. The good cards never made there potential.. AK beaten by 6's. Some bad play on my part being too commited to a few draws when the pot odds were not there. I was down to $4 of my original $25 buy in. I got a few hands to hold up and bring me up to a safe .50/1 level of like $10. Finally I got 5 hands in a row that were something like 2 x 4 of a kind, Flush, and two pair. Ended up at $37. The four of a kind flopped Q88 and I had the Hilton sisters. I just bet out instead of playing sneaky guy. I got called by two. Next card was a Q to make my 4 of a kind. Possible flush. I bet again. Last card is a K. I check. Get a better. 3rd guy calls. I raise. I get both of them to donate an extra two bucks! Yeehaww!   It has been nice to be playing solid poker and getting the cards. I have had 1 losing session in the last 10 .50/1. Probably because the competition sucks. I also had a losing session playing multi table. Now any of you who have been reading this Blog know multi table usually makes me ill. Dizzy. stressed. bad. I was able to play this time without feeling any of this. I lost, so I was probably not playing as well as I do when single table, but it is a step in the right direction.

      Ok. First of if you have not done so already, go to the Cards Speak and read the write up on NL. It is very good. It had a few ideas I had not seen. It is very well written unlike my drivel.   If you remember I was trying to get to $200 in my bankroll for this weekend. I am now almost at $300 and probably have a chance to make that. I played two excellend NL tables. One I was up to $61 at and then I switched tables and brought this one up to 116. Nice job for NL. I had people calling my flushes with nada. I got lucky and had a K high flush call his whole stack into my A high flush! Bahhhhahahaha! I just could not do wrong. One thing I would like to say about NL when you get a stack over $100 in a $25 NL. You can really bully people around. You can make $4 bets on Q high nothing and win. Just choose your places to do this, bet consistantly, and make them buy it. You can get alot of blinds this way if you want. Not sure how this fits in with playing the premium cards only, but being a bully is fun.

      Well I did not do any damage, but I did play higher stakes than I should have. Tried a little 2/4 last night. I definatly do not have 300BB. I actually really should not be playing .50/1 by those definitions but thats all there is. One of these days I will get a little self control.  It was a decent night. I placed 3rd and 6th in tourneys. I was down in .50/1. I played a little NL. I am not patient enough for that game. It is losing it's allure. I killed the 2/4 game I was in. Not alot of good hands, but good callers. Ended up $76 or so. So my roll is now slightly over 200. Sweet.  Almost forgot. I only had one good hand in my 6th place tourney finish. It was a tight table. One of my early hands, I am the BB and limp in with K8. The flop is KKK. I checked into $200 of bets. The next round was another $200. They checked around to me and I bet $15. I probably should have bet like $100 since the pot was large.. maybe $50. I did not want people to fold. Oh well. That was the only playable hand. I went out on Q8, flop Q85. Turn 6. River K. Beat by a straight.

      The Blog is healthy and apparently alot of people view it. Not sure why. I find it pleasing on some level though. Here are some statistics:  .78 cents a share valuation on Blogshares.com.  International appeal with 53 US hits, 9 Canadian, 1 Sweden (HDouble?), and 1 Australian.  Average browser resolution is 1024x768. Good screens to read the Blog on.  Unique visitors over all time is 260. I get about 5-10 unique visitors per day. I also average around 40 repeat visitors per day. This was a very surprising stat since I have only every heard from like 5 of you.   For whatever reason peak usage seems to be on Thursdays. Need something to get you guys over the hump?   I find these stats totally meaningless but good for the ego.   I wonder if any of you like the live hand-by-hand play reports I do every once in a while when the mood strikes me. I prefer to be more profound if I can, but the play-by-play I think gives you a look into my thought process in hand selection and game play.   One other thing I wonder is if I play aggressively enough. I am always the guy at the table with the K on a 55K flop that is thinking: Does he have the other 5? He must? I mean he is calling me right? He is not chasing an Ace? Nahh.. he must have the 5! Aggresion is funny. I used to be VERY passive. Never raising. Always calling. I then started playing more aggresivly on the advice of a Blogger. I forget who now, read my Archives. I think it is called something like "I like Agggresion". My idea of agression now is raising pre-flop with a good hand. Betting down to the river. I still do not raise alot. I will rarely every get it up to 4BB even if the other guy lets me. So I guess I am agressive for me, but maybe still not there. If any other Bloggers want something to write about I would like to hear there idea's on how to play aggresively. It is a facinating subject.

      I might be playing a little less. The wife is getting on my case. We will see. She says I play too much poker. I think she really does not like to see me happy. The truth is probably somewhere in between.  Anyway.. started a 10/1 tourney nicely tonight. I had AA. Round one. I bet 4BB or $60. Most people fold. I get a nice flop. 10-9-4 rainbow or something. So I try and push the guy next to me out by betting $100. He calls. Q on the turn. Now I am sorta worried on the straight. So I bet $250. Calls. Ends up with a 2 at the river. I put him all in with $450. He calls me!!! He must have put me on AK. He flips 10-J and loses. Now was I too agressive? Probably. But he never raised me. I guess he felt pot committed and thought the 2nd high pair would be a winner? Go figure. So I have doubled up to $1600 in the first round. Going to try and cruise to the money. Make more moves with good cards or at the 4th level.  Got an A8 diamonds. It was raised to me. I call. Flop is a scary 10-10-8. I check. Everyone checks. Next card is a 9d. I check. Second guy checks. Agressive guy bets $175. I call. Second Guy Checks. Last card is a 3s. Now I would have liked a diamond. I am scared. Agressive guy checks. I check. I win with 10's and 8's against AQ. Up to 2K. No need for me to make any moves until the end now.  Ended up in 3rd place. Called KQ against A6 and could not make a card. Called A8 against a pair of 3's and could not get a card then either. Man!  Playing some .50/1 now. May break $150 tonight! May not. We shall see. Good signs. First hand everyone folds to me. I win .75 with 10-5o. I guess I want a table that calls more though. Six people in the next one. We will see.  Lost a few bucks on a flush draw that never made it. Probably a bad bet because of there being only 2 people in. Need to think before I act.  K2s gets 3 callers. Diamond flop. Nobody stays in. This is a WEAK table I think. I think I need to be more aggresive against this table.  Played AQ aggresive. Someone flops a KK and I never improve. Oh well. Cost me $4. Should have known this tight ass had something.  Table has changed over. Hope it is better for me. $8.50 called to the river and everyone folds. I think the table is better. Got screwed on 2 Aces by 3 4's. He played with 4-5 offsuit. This table is getting better.  AJ stood up for a $4 pot. Ace High. Bet a pair of 10's to see what if someone had the Aces. Got called and folded. Played 10-9 for a quarter. Do not really like straight draws for some reason. What do other people think? Anyway, flopped 10-9. Couple of 7;s showed up, but played it anyways. Won a nice sized pot. Up to $26.25.  Played a flush draw. Then became a straight draw. Had pot odds. Missed it. Cost me a few bucks. Got AK now. Raised. Now I have to fold it. Flush flop, as well as some betting on the turn. Nothing paired up. Good fold I think. $22.25. Up and Down. Round and Round. Family guy is making fun of Mr. Peabody. Like it.  This table is definately much better. Just not getting the cards. Yet. Folded 4-2 rag. Nothing to play. 5-2. What a rag! I am the BB. Watch me flop 552. Oops, not getting the chance. It was raised. 8-10-J anyways.  Soooted connectors. 6-7. Nada on the flop. Cya. $21.25.  A6 sooted. I like this one. I feel good about it. 4 to the flush. Have Aces. Aces and Q's. Lost to AK!!! Screw me! $18.25. Aces and Queens with a K kicker. Where is my 4th club damn it! I hate kickers.  8-J diamonds. Let's see what happens here. Flopped trips. I bet them. Is this a mistake? Do I milk people more? I got one guy to the river. Hmm.. Maybe I did misplay this hand. $24.50 now. Yo-Yo night for me so far.  9-3 suited. Have 5 callers. 4 to the diamonds. I am betting it out. Lost. $22.50.  A-10 suited. Is this a raising hand? Lost this one too. Almost made a straight. $21.25.  Pair of 6's.. Set? Nahhhh.. Folding out. 6's and 2's on the board. Someone has a 2! Yup. A-2 wins it. Down to $21.  Someone takes a monster pot with 77 when it flops 227. AK finally holds up for $8. Up to $27.25. It is nice to be on the upswing for the moment. I called the raise to my AK. Should I have re-raised? I was comfortable with calling and then betting out when I made the pair of aces.  Folded A-10 suited when the board is 55J. Trips takes it. 6-7 suited. 4 to a flush and straight. Missed both of course. $24.75. Call .50 on an A-7. Like a bigger kicker if possible. Folded it. $23.75. yuk yuk yuk.  A3 checked into as the BB. Folded on flop. Would have gotten a straight to the 6. Winning hand. But I do not lie runner-runner straights. AK again. Raising it. K on the flop. One bet. I raised it. What the heck! I have the K with the kicker. I bet it to the river. I win! What a surprise. $29.25. Finally a noticable amout ahead. Ok. it is only $4 but I like it. Moved a tad over the $150 mark. See if I can keep it. Futurama has a spoof of Star Trek Vulcan Love episode.  K2 suited. Flop is a rainbow rag. Not going any further with this hand. $28.25.  Q2 played with a 1$ raise before it got to me. Made the flush and the ten bucks. $38.75! Had trip 2's if I did not fold. Damn! Oh well. Aqua Teen Hunger Force is going off the air. I like that show. I used to hate it.  AA -- Raising it up! I got table moxy now so I am getting people to fold. AA wins $7. I am up to $45.75. Things are on a roll now baby! Rapid Angle always calls me to the river. He is great. If you see him on Empire let me know. Played 4-10s. Beat by the kicker. Tried to fake the flush when the spade came. Nobody bought it. This is good for me. I am going to make money at this table. My 99 just boated up. I paused. Then bet. One guy was too smart, the other one raised me, I raised him and walla $50. I am going to sleep in 12 minutes. I am going to play it slow until then. Fight to the death on futurerama. Fry can either die or get to make love to a crab lady. Ouch.  Gonna play a Q9. I do not usually play this. Maybe I should? Folded to a possible flush. $49.25. Sigh. Q7 suited. I love the flush draws. Called a raise. A and some rags. Good time to fold. $48.25. So much for low aggression. Have the low end of QJ10K flop. Damn. Someone MUST have an Ace. I fold. Someone does. $46. J-10. Playing alot of hands for low aggression. Two pair loses to a straight. Had 4 to a flush on that too. Screw me! Down to $43. I should bail. I have 4 minutes to lose some more though. Some people do not realise you should fold AQ when it makes nothing. Oh well. It cost that guy 5 bucks to see he lost to someones jacks. 94 sooted. I know I suck. I had to fold them when the wrong suit rears its ugly head. All diamonds. Pair of sixes again. This could be a good last hand. cmon. Let me check. Damn! Have to fold. $42. Did not make it anyway. KK wins it. Ok last hand. Bad hand. 24 diamonds. Ok. Leaving with $40. Up $15 for the session and a $9 win from 10/1 tourney. $161.50 total. Not too bad. Almost back up to my buyin.  BTW - I went to Blogshares and now lay claim to my blog!   urlLink

      WARNING: This is an attempt to recreate a story that the Blogger ate. The original was excellent and I am kicking myself for closing the Word Document before seeing if it was online. The one thing I hate about rewriting is the rewrite is never as good as the old one in your mind. NEVER! Anyway enjoy the second rate version. I finally got it back to at least a readable form.  DISCLAIMER: All of you that think I am the cool guy, with the rock hard abs and women on each arm must not read any further. In reality I am the computer nerd stuck in his basement with no lights on until 3AM playing .. err .. Poker. I know this will come to a shock to all of my female readers and you probably will never read my Blog again but I am prepared to suffer for my art.   I was over at Bad Bloods site reading about the much anticipated release of Doom III. Blood mentions playing the previous versions of Doom  and Doom II. I can relate. I have spent many sleepless nights in loving arms of a computer game. He neglects to mention the granddaddy of them all: Castle Wolfenstein, although I can see him playing that also. All of this brought back a funny Doom related story that I am inspired to share with you all for some reason.  My best friend John was trying to start a new business. What he was doing I do not know.  Being a good friend though I offer to let him crash at my place rent-free for a few months until the business takes off. He ended up spending more time at the pool than the job. I do not want to give the impression that John is a deadbeat because he is not. One tip for people wanting to start a business: Summertime is not the right time, especially when there is a nice young talkative blonde lifeguard named Julie. Does anyone know the percentage of businesses that fail due to flirtation?  I met John on a BBS system. For those of you youngins out there, the BBS was the modem predecessor to the Internet. It had it all: message boards, chat, porn, all the good things of today’s Internet except at 1200bps. One night around 11PM we decide to fireup a multi-player session of Doom. Our systems were hooked together through a NULL modem cable and some wire. Really high tech stuff.   For those of you who have never played Doom it is a very loud game. There are missile launchers, gattlin guns, and all kinds of monster noises. Do not even get me started with the BFG. It stands for “Big Freaking Gun” and it lived up to its name. If you heard the whirring sound of it warming up you were already dead. It also probably did not help that my speakers were on the floor.  So we are playing for a few hours, having a great time, speakers blaring, when I hear a WHAM! Of course I thought this must have come from the game and did not stop for a single beat. BANG! BANG! BANG! Ok. It was not the game. Must have been the door. Who the hell is knocking at my door and disturbing my game? How inconsiderate! I hide my guy in some remote part of the world to avoid being killed and go answer the door.  At the door is every young twenty-something’s fantasy come true. There is a real cute looking blonde girl standing there. She is wearing a skimpy nightshirt looking very fine! Her pert .. little .. nipples .. but I digress. Now, if you read paragraph one of this post, you have probably figured out by now that I am not going to get any. Well, I did get something, an ear full of curses and things better left unwritten. Apparently she had work in the morning and I was keeping her up. Cmon lady, it is only 3AM! Needless to say the game ended quickly.   The next morning she tried to get her revenge. She came upstairs at 6AM and starts pounding on the door. Now little did she know she was messing with a guy who fell out of a bunk bed at age eight, woke up briefly, and went back to sleep. I am literally the sleeping dead. John on the other hand does not have my great ability. He got up and answered the door. She said something to the effect of “How do you like that” and left. Bitch? Or am I being sensitive?  So that is my Doom contribution. It just so happens that my name on the site comes from a grandchild of Doom called Quake, or more accurately “Team Fortress”. I will leave this for another day though.

      Tonight has been fun. I was going to play a 5/1 SNG. All the tables were full, so I did a 10/1. I find the competition to be basically the same from 5/1 through 20/2 so far. Possibly a few less maniacs. You usually do not see 4 people out in round one at 20/2.  I bought the NL Holdem book (listed at the bottom) and have been trying to improve my game. Basically he says “Before level 4 only go in on ultra-premium hands”. I.E. JJ or better. AJ or higher. Nothing with any loss potential.  So I put it on deal me away and prepare to wait until level 4. The game would not let me wait. I got like 3-4 AK, AJ, Hiltons, etc.. before level 4. My Hiltons held up against AK. My AJ’s flopped good stuff, or my table image was good enough that I caused many people to fold with my 4BB raises with good hands. So around level 4 I am middle of the pack. The competition is especially good and tight up to this point. I get crappy cards from then on in. Only like two hands worth calling. One call I made was KQ against 66, and lost. I folded K10 and would have won that one.  As the blinds got more expensive the maniacs came out of the woodworks and gave me 2nd place. I basically folded to 2nd place. It was a nice win.  I am now in a .50/1 tourney. First hand Aks. Get’s raised around. Flop is A-rag-rag. I get two callers. Turn is a rag. Last card is a K. Had both callers to the river. Made $10 on my first hand. I then got Aks a little later. By now any raise I have people fold. So I am hovering around $33 right now. Folded Q5s, the turn would have tripled my 5’s. Oh well. It was a good fold if you ask me.  I am at a nice table. They let me check a straight draw to the river. Sweet. Did not make it, but did not cost me either. Bet I would have gotten 6 callers if I bet at the end with that straight. At $32.75 now. Just waiting for my next hand. Folding a lot.  Had 99. Raised coming in. Knocked a few people out. Three left. 8-10-Q flop. Not so good. Checked around. Three on the turn. Bet by two. I call. I do not have pot odds, but wanted to see the last card. Jack-Baby! Oh yeah straight! No flushes. Possible higher straight. I check knowing the twos is going to bet. I raise. Both people call me. Straight beats two pair. It has been a good night. $40.25 right now with KQ. Caught a straight on the river. So did my partner. We raised it to 4 bets. Got one sucker in with us and went up to 43.50. Lost with 10-J suited. Down to $43. I am going to play a few more hands. Stop if I fall to $40, or get a nice few hands to push me up to $50+.  AQ gets me a win. Sweet. I cannot tell you how many times I have lost with this. Up to $45.25. Like it. It is soooooo nice to have a really winning night. One that I do not screw up with bad play, higher pots, or some other stupid idea. I like the idea of playing a 5/1, and $25 on .50/1 every night. If I am doing really well, maybe do another 5/1 tourney or something. I think if I stick to this plan I will steadily grow my bankroll again. I may stay at .50/1 forever though. I like these people! Only $50 left to go until I am back up to my re-buy level. Hope to hit $500 this month maybe. Not going to push anything this time though.  Bluffed someone off of a hand. I had Q-10. Flop was 77K. I wait a little. Then check. A K shows. I Check again. He bets. I call. A 5 comes up. I decide to screw with him and bet a buck. He folds like a blanket on laundry day. Up to $43 (or down if you read the prior paragraph). Since he bet out I put him on a small pair. Smaller then 5's it seems.  A-9 puts me back up to $44.25. 66. Cmon Set! Satans helpers? Missed the set. Oh well. J-10 off suit. Nada. Rags. Rags. Rags. 9-3 .. Sooted! Cmon, It is ok to play. 744. Ok. I am not that stupid. Besides, only one heart. I like 4 hearts in my flush draws. Also like alot of callers. 10-2 diamonds. I told you I like flush draws. Raised. I call. Had to fold on the flop. Hilton Sisters! Go Girlfriends! Slow betting. Nobody has anything? Raised the bitches. Everyone folds out. Oh well. $1.75.  Back down to $41.25. Getting blinded down a little. One nice win and I think I call it a night. Table seems even tighter than when I started. Only two in on the flop.  K8. Getting impatient. Not a horrible hand. Like a better kicker however. Flop is 4-5-8. Turns into a straight on the board to give me a tie. 77 does not do anything. 55 on the next hand. Presto! Lets have some magic. Crap. 10-10. A queen appears. The other guy has the Q. I am down to $37. Up $12 for the session. Not too bad. So net-net up $37 for the night. I will take that.

       I feel like I have been droning on about the grind every day. Probably gets fairly boring to read. It is kind of boring to me. Ahh how I wish I had that 1K back.. oh well.. I will try and post some nice content for all my loyal readers. Althought the RSF was kind of cool I had never seen one on Empire to that point.   Grinding away last night. It was a weird night. A flying squirrel gets into our house when I am playing some .50/1 or NL. This is around 1AM. So I put the game on pause, and go and chase this little rodent around my son’s room for an hour. I finally figure out I am never going to catch the bastard, and my juicy .50/1 table is waiting for me. So I call the local Animal Control Officer. Apparently he is on vacation but they would be more then willing to recommend a service. It ends up costing me $350 to get someone to come and catch this guy. Unfortunately he cannot find the tricky flying rat. So I go back and hit the tables for a little more. Actually ended up being a good night. I had some good games on .50/1. The night started really badly. I just could not put two cards together. I did get 3rd in a 5/1 tourney. Promptly went out on the next hand after. I forget what I had. It was a decent hand to go all in on, but I missed it. I played some 25NL and broke even in that for the night. Played a 20/2 tourney. Came in 4th. The next hand after that the 3rd place guy goes all in and loses. I may just stick to 5/1 tourneys and .50/1 for a while. I had a fantastic night in .50/1. I doubled up my first stake and won 15$ on my second, and 3$ on my third. I had one bust out because everything I got never hit anything. I had AK and the flop is some 2,4,9 rags and never got better. I had a flush beaten by a higher flush when the final card was the 4th spade. The rest was rags and flops not connecting.    So at 3AM the rodent makes another appearance, this time in my bedroom. We call the animal control guy back, and he finally catches it and tosses it out the window. I did not look outside the window today to see if he could really fly. Oh well.    Anyway, the bankroll ended up about even for the night. I think I was maybe up a few bucks when all was said and done. One good thing about losing my bankroll is that I have become much more interested in playing 10 sided, instead of 6. I always liked 6. It seemed to me like my better hands would hold up, my flushes would hit more, it was just an all around easier and more profitable situation. Now that I have been forced to play more 10 sided games I am liking them. In 6 sided I would probably see 2-3 people in on any hand. Possibly 4 if the table was decent, and occasionally all 6. In the 10 sided (at least at .50/1), I was on tables where all 10 people were in on the flop. So the net gain is 10SB instead of 2SB. This is nice. Yes. I like this. On the turn in .50/1 you can take 5-6 people with you. Sometimes more. Six sided your usually down to 2 others. So 5BB vs 2BB. Sweet. I think my attitude towards playing with a lot of people was flawed and I have adjusted my thinking.  Once my bankroll is in a healthy range again I am going to try some 2/4 10 sided instead of ½ 6 sided I think. Here is to better times!

       Well,   I think I will end with a winning session at $25 NL. Barring any accidents. It all came down to one good hand. KK. Cowboys. Cowboy up baby! I bet them hard at the pre-flop. Got raised all in by #3, called by #4. Everyone else folds. Get a nice flop. No high cards. Bet hard. All in for #4. Call. Tripple up on the turn. River is nothing. Sir is up $35 in about 5 minutes. Sweet! Now only $965 to go! Wahhhh! heh. Oh well.. Nice to have a good session.   *** UPDATE: Left the $25NL with $66 in hand. Nice little session. Then went to a .50/1 for some safe small action. First hand is Poket Rockets. Raised full 4 bets. Flop is a dangerous 223 with two clubs. This round is bet up to 3BBs. Next card is A. Sweet! Someone caught there runner-runner flush. Made about $40 in 1 hand in .50/1. Maybe I have been avoiding the 10 person tables for no good reason. I really like playing 6 sided, but hmm..

      It is really frustrating starting over. It is kind of like trying to start a fire with a stick and some flint. The $100 that I bought in for doesnt help against any kind of variance. If you lose a couple of sessions you are buying in again.   Anyway, not too much to report. I need to have a good session and just walk away. I was up 20$ in 1/2 and pissed that away. Was up $15 this morning in NL and pissed that away. The call I ruined it on was really bad. Had 10's on the flop. High Card. So I bet the pot trying to push people out. The turn was a Q. And the river was a 8, to make my enemies boat. It was really stupid to call this. REALLY! About the only good thing that has happened in the last couple of days is a nice RSF.&nbsp; I will post the hand history but it was easy to play. I flopped 4 to a flush, hit the NUT flush and then made the RSF just to rub it in. Someone said Part gives hats for this. I was on Empire, No Hat! Was I falling for a newbie joke or something?   Anyway, cards are running cold. Getting fed up. I think I might go back to how I built my bankroll in the beginning. Play some easy 5/1$ tourneys and try and jack it up a little. I really hope I can get a nice winning session. Not much. Just a few bucks to feel better.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Well, I finally did it. I blew my bankroll out. On the good side it was only $50 to start with. On the bad side it took a while to get up to 1K. Spent a few hours yelling and screaming, and sleeping, and being depressed. Got over that. Feeling sorta bummed about killing my entire bankroll, especially when there were some good times to stop doing so. Like when I brought it up to $600 again with some good play. I think it is good that this happened for my long term career however. I think doing this just cements home the fact you need to play at levels your bankroll can support. I did the "Higher Level Fixes All" thing too many times for my own good. I guess I was fortunate in some ways that I got away with it 2-3 times, but the fact that I now know I can lose it all is a good thing.  Anyway, I am going to cash in another $100 this week sometime. Jump back on the horse. I think I am going to play a little less. I think I was playing so much that the challenge and excitement of the game was dimished somewhat. Not to mention the wife giving me a hard time. Going to work on making my game solid again. I played some really solid poker on my downfall, and some bad poker also. I like the solid play. It resulted in small downturns as I lost blinds and folded quesitonable hands, and big upswings as I milked my good cards for every dollar they deserved.  I am going to try and get into the August Freeroll. I am not sure what I need to do to qualify, but that would be a nice win, and it does not cost anything. I know coming in 3rd was somewhat luck and somewhat good play, but if I can do it again, it would be a nice start to me new run.  Wish me luck in my climb again! I am starting at -300 instead of +800 now. Not very good, but I am excited to climb back on the horse and play solid Poker again.  I might as well share some of my asperations at this low point. I *think* it should be possible to make $2000 a month playing poker at some point. I think I need to get my bankroll up to like $5K-10K or something first. Then I can play some more worthwhile levels of Poker.  It is a nice dream. The extra 2K a month while not enough to support me, definatly goes a long way to making the bills. It should be a pretty easy goal at some point in time. Once I get there I can see what the next goal would be. I think it *might* be nice to do Poker as a career, but I am not sold on that yet. It is nice to have a good IT salary coming in every month, but I also have been a bit less amused with the whole IT thing lately. It has gone from something that was enjoyable to something I have to do to pay the mortgage and support the family. With all of the outsourcing and downturns in the industry it has not been a fun few years. I have been more fortunate than many others in IT, but who knows how long that is going to last. It would be nice to have a good backup career. The wife says I can do it as soon as my bankroll reaches $360K! I guess that will be my next goal. Talk about a sweet dream! I would guess this would take a very long time (if ever), but we will see. You need some goals and dreams to play this crazy game.  Anyway
