      It was a seemingly normal day when Jordan awoke, little did he know an evil wizzard had cursed the fair city of Vancouver with diabolical spell of infernal heat. Jordan and his girlfriend Princess Jxenna (who he had recently rescued from the evil clutches of The Pitt Deamon) were planning a day of rocket skating near the great ocean. However they were side tracked on mission of foreign relations in Jxenna's home country. When they arived at the great ocean (trying not to melt from the extreme heat) They realized that a band of thieving Kenders (under the guise of busking jugglers) had stolen all of their water! With quick thinking Jordan spotted a spring of eternal refreshment, but a magical barier prevented them from getting near it. Jordan tried his limited magic on the wall of energy, but to no avail. With a sigh they continued on, barely conscience from the lack of moister in their bodies. They came apon a beach on north end of the great bay of English where they rested for a big. Again Jordan tried to conjour some clean drinking water, but his lack of energy eas affecting his abuility to polymorph the amount of sand needed for the spell. As they rounded the bay, it apeared that a great battle was going on, so they were forced to take a detour around the long way, they turned off their rocket skates to avoid detection. Finally after what seemed like forever, they aproached the great world of science. But there were soldiers everwhere, Jordan wasn't sure what they were looking for, but he was pretty sure he didn't want to find out, so with great stealth, they slipped through a shortcut undetected. They finally reached the great buck of stars, the legendary potion shop. But it was closed up (probably because of the soldier occupation) But as the were about to give up, Princess Jxenna discovered a seceret opening in the wall, which led them to well of eternal life. They finally had enough energy to board the train from the sky, and were magically wisked home.   We were lucky this time... this time...  To Be Continued...

      Fred found himself at a bowling facility in maple ridge. Which was an odd thing, because fred had no idea who he was. He ended up bowling with several good looking girls, and split a pitcher of beer with the hottest one of all. So even though he had no idea what was going on, he didn't seem to mind too much. The first game went well, he broke 100, and all was good, except for the time he discovered his super powers by throwing the bowling ball right through the pin stacking machine, and caused the whole system to shut down. The strange anal woman who worked there couldn't even fix it. So part way through the game, Fred the guy and his possy of female bowlers moved to another lane. Which worked out better, because he felt more "disco-ie" in the middle of a crowd. He soon realized that as hot as Lilly was, she was no threat to him, neither was Ree, How ever this Sheera chick seemed to have some super human strength, something about being the sister of the master of the universe or something. However she didn't become a problem until the second game. Fred still isn't sure if it was a curse, or just the amount of alcohol he had consumed by that point. But he started to suck. It seemed as though there were strange magnetic forces at work pushing his ball away from the pins. By now fred was getting quite hungry so he and Lilly had a couple of burritos that he found in his backpack (which he didn't even know he owned). Not knowing anything about himself was a strange feeling, but he tried not to let it bother him. After a short round of meditation, Fred got his game back, and Beat the curse, for he started kicking butt once again. Which worked out well for him, for it seemed that ever time he knocked down all the times in one shot, he got boob kisses from his band of female companions. Fred wasn't complaining. Near the end of the night his hands were getting sore, so he started pushing buttons on the bowling machine, weird noises started coming from the gears, and the smell of electrical smoke could faintly be detected coming from the back, so Ree stole a bowling ball, and they headed for door as fast as they could.  Fred still doesn't know who he his.  The End.

      It was a bright sunny day and the wind was blowing that perfect way that makes you think back to your childhood. The trees were whispering, the birds were chirping, and Jordan the great galloped home across his kingdom on his valaint steed Crackers. He was returning from a visit to princess Jxenna in the far off kingdom of Pitt Meadows. Suddenly the sky grew dark. Lightning flashed causing the trees that surounded him to apear angry and evil. Thunder shook the land, and Crackers reared up. Jordan, calming his horse, unsheathed his sword with a firy spark. Jordan knew what awaited him at his castle, he had seen this evil before. So with a crack of the reigns he raced across the stormy woodland!  Jordan the Great slowly creeked open the large wooden doors at the entrance to his castle. Inside he could here the fiendish sounds of his foe's hidious battle music. The walls dripps with a sticky green ooze that stunk of week old hash. A burning sensation seared it's way down to Jordan lungs as he noticed a bluish haze that hung in the air like a dragon had just battled his last knight. Barely able to keep his coughs and gasps from alerting the intruders, Jord crept on, tightening the grip on his sword.  Jordan the Great rounded the corner to his thrownroom. His jaw dropped to the floor and his eyes widened. Nothing could have prepared him for what he saw. Skinned animals lay strewn about the room, their intestines spilling out onto the floor. Goblets of human blood lay everywhere, atracting flies and other pesty creatures. And there in the center of it all were the two evil masters behind the plots of so many dastardly deeds done in Jordan's kingdom.  The two creatures were no ordinary goblins. They were Master goblins. Covered with tatoes, and powered by the blood of countless villagers.  Jordan stepped out of the shadows and bashed his sword against his shield cause the dastardly duo to spin around with a start. "I say foul beasts" Said Jordan. "Get Thy putrid carcus from off my holy thrown!" The Goblins screams obsenities in goblen tongue. Jordan could speak enough goblin to know that didn't care to know what they said. Putting his shield on his back, and grasping his sword with two hands, Jordan assumed an offensive stance. Thine king is offering thou a chance to leave this holy place with thine lives. Said Jordan as one of the goblins swung at him with a huge bone he found on the floor. The goblin screams, "YOU DIDN'T LEAVE YOU DOOR OPEN! WE HAD TO BREAK IN!" Jordan quickly parried the attack, and with an upward thrust, sliced of the beasts right arm. The other goblin who had remained silent untill this point, peeled himself off the thrown, and charged at our hero. this one was a fool and with a simple lean to the left was avoided. The clumsy goblin fell to the ground where his feet swiftly detached from his legs with a punctual blast from Jordan's sword.  The goblins howled in anger and scurried off to the bowls of the basement. Though Jordan had not completly taken care of them, the smell was begining to leave, and that was a start.
