      Today I was told that I have not been considering what she feels. Which is so wrong, but you can not convince someone of that. The fact of the matter is, I have not had a chance to show her that I consider how she feels, because she won't talk to me!  Why do people punish themselves. If she really cared enough to be upset about the fact that I am not considering how she feels, she would tell me how she feels. I think rather, she is moping and blaming it on me. Because, really I haven't done anything wrong. Or if I have, she won't tell me what it is.  Fustrated about the situation... Back to waiting.   The opposite of talking isn't listening. The opposite of talking is waiting.   Fran Lebowitz (1950 - )

      Today history was made.  For the first time ever a private non-government sponsered manned space craft exited the confines of earth and entered outerspace. This is the very beginning of the private manned space industry. I believe 100 years from now, this day will be in the record books.   urlLink SpaceShipOne

      Surrounded by fabulous fantasies about your right to do alright, when alright isn't good enough for you.  Surrounded by frivolous failure which doesn't matter, because no one expects more from you.  Surrounded by the failure to fantasize, you're scared because your fantasies don't come true.

      Did I misread, or misunderstand?   I thought there was an unsaid communication.  I don’t mean a declaration,  I mean a conformation.  I thought there was a moment of certain confidence,  where neither of us were on the fence.  I even thought the past made sense.  I thought truth was made clear and it was sincere.  It was almost as if we’ve always been here.   I thought, for a moment, there was no exaggeration,  just the truth of the situation,  which left us in complete infatuation.  For me that moment was intense,  because I dropped my defense,  and shared that moment without hesitance.  It was a moment without fear,  because I knew this feeling could not disappear.  Did I misread, or misunderstand, because …  Now I am in a state of frustration.  No, more a state of disorientation,  because I don’t know what happened to all this communication.  I don’t know what a moment like this represents,  or even if they exist,  or even if you understand all of this.   Did I misread, or misunderstand?

      I finally met L. We had talked on email for two weeks first. She looked surprised by my appearance. But she seemed to like me.   L is way too good-looking. Really,&nbsp; she is an absolute knock-out. The kind of girl that sticks out in any room. I am definitely&nbsp;intimidated by her, although I do a pretty good job of hiding it. I wonder how well I will get to know her.   My quick thoughts&nbsp;about her:  -She is gorgeous.  -Seems smart  -Almost seems like a pretty-girl  without  pretty-girl syndrome, which I have never seen before  -Certainly kind  -Got the feeling she does not want to settle down with anyone & that she doesn't trust people.  -She must be hiding some  pretty-girl craziness   -Finally, seems to good to be true - really really hoping that she is true.   Happy, anxious (but a good anxious)&nbsp;and worried.   (BTW, haven't heard from G in five weeks. I worry about her)

      My day is going well, I am writing a report today, which is kind of dull. For lunch, we went to this place called Big Joe's. It was awful and I am not feeling well now because of the food I had. Joe (I assume it was Joe) is an big&nbsp;old Italian who like to swear allot, he probably weighed 250 - but not fat, muscle. He said things like "What do you MFs want?" and "Do you want to F with me?"&nbsp;and "How the F am I supposed to make a living if you MFs don't order anything to drink!?". After getting his initial string of profanities out, he went on about his life and how he was a professional wrestler and an Actor. He says he acted in JAWS and wrestled with Hulk Hogan. He also said he as 82, and I KNOW that was a lie, he wasn't over 70. He kept calling my Irish friend who was with me "Irish Boy", and going on about how all Irish people love him, and that he was all over Ireland in the Marines (Side note: The marines were never in Ireland). Long story short, it was a very interesting lunch, and I enjoyed it&nbsp;because it made the day unique. I know it probably sounds like I am not telling the truth ... but that is the truth. Everybody has to eat there once just to experience the place.

      The tiredness collapses around what I thought  blackness seeps through the honeycombed walls  and envelopes the sharp corners of the mind  the thought closes its eyes  and folds, and bends, and cracks  till it resembles the softness of paper  wrinkled 5,186 times  like over-exaggerated origami  from the stomach of surrender  which turns and grinds  against your desire  to just go home

      Hello L,  How are you today? I don't particularly like Mondays but today has been pretty good. This morning has been really productive and I have made some other people happy by solving their problems. Which is always a good way to start the week.  I met D last fall I guess. Through a mutual friend named G. He went to high school with D and was my roommate at college. In fact, when I first met D it was to check out his apartment to see if I liked it, which lead to me getting an apartment across the street. D is a good guy, real easy to get along with. How is he to work with? I went to his engagement party this weekend, which was pretty cool. He paid for everything, all the food and beverage. I learned that D is not shy when it comes to gasoline and fire.  Do you like working at A? What do you do there & how long have you been there? I have had my job for a year. Which, I am embarrassed to admit, is now the longest job I have ever had. It is kind of nice though, because now I know all my co-workers very well and people don't really give me a hard time about anything. Which is all I can really ask for. I am excited to say that I paid to golf on Thursday at the Annual CTS Hackers Golf Tournament (CTS would be my division). Now, don't get the impression that I am any good at golf at all, but anytime I can get a day off work to spend it outside with all my friends . I will take that opportunity. That was a little off-subject, but that's ok.  What little I was told about you seemed like a wonderful person. D has a great impression of you. Please feel free to email me back, I work near the computer all day. D has suggested that the four of us go for coffee some time this week. I am always eager to meet new people, so I think it is a good idea. But whatever you feel comfortable with.  Have a great day, Duane  . . . 40 emails back and forth & two days later . . .  Well, I have enjoyed our conversation. About ... I don't really know. :)  I hope that you are feeling better than you were this morning. Have a great vacation. Try and take a day trip somewhere or something. And please say NO to your other employers. Maybe we can get together with D and K one day soon and meet one another. Should I give you a call or something?  Talk to you soon, Duane  :-) I hope you have a great rest of the day and week. If you would like to e-mail me at home here is my home address. xxxxxxxxx@hotmail.com Talk to you soon. Make sure to smile  :-) L

      What you give me  =================   what you give me  is something to hold on to  the truss that holds heaven  bearing too much weight  with amazing grip  not of the future  or the past  of a place called now  where nothing is important  except my desire  and what you call  comfort   what you give me something addictive  temporary like your smile  a calm sand storm  which tears with tears  trusses  fall apart  hit the ground  grip the ground  I collapse  as if the ground hit me running   what you give me a pathway  through this mess  of insecurity  sickness  puke  my life  you take it away  and amplify it  and give it back  in pieces  small enough to choke on   what you give me is hope  familiar hope  my hope  you took  used  gave it back  used  old wrinkled smelly hope  hope without hope  hope without you

      I haven't quite decided what kind of stuff I am going to write into this blog, weblog, web journal ... whatever it is called. I don't have the motivation, time, or energy to write in it everyday. And sometimes I just don't want to write down what I am thinking because I know it is a passing thought and it really isn't worth the effort. Never-the-less, I have read some other blogs where they write down there daily activities and thoughts, and it is pretty interesting.  Well, I think for now I will continue to write how I have been writing. And for definition sake: I have been writing when ever I think it is worth the effort to type it out. It may be just one of my hobbies, or interest, or something stupid I found on the web. And sometimes it will be deep thoughts about nothing (which is pretty much what I am writing now). Other times I will write about how I a feeling about a situation, and that can be anything from sadness, to anger, to joy. And finally I may write about situations and random occurances. Whatever.  Situation:  I just finished talking to L (I won't use names because I am paranoid and I am worried that somehow these people I write about will read this). We have been friends for a long time. She just broke up with her boyfriend. It was kind of weird this time though, it was as if I thought I could now move in on that. It was difficult for me to be objective when she was telling about why they broke up, because in the back of my mind I was happy for selfish reasons. Even though I could never ask her, I have often thought about what kind of couple we would make. To be perfectly honest, she is the only girl who I have ever met who I feel I understand why she does what she does. She has never surprised me, and in every situation I would of done just as she has. She didn't even have to tell why she broke up with her boyfriend because I knew. Even though I have only met him once. There is only one reason why L would break up with him. And I knew that, but I asked anyway. They never seemed very natural to me anyway.  But, come to think of it, none of her boyfriends have ever seen natural. Even E, who she was going to marry. I'll tell you, if they were not engaged I am not sure we could have become as good friends as we are. Not that we are really really good friends, I only talk to her every couple of weeks, but we have good talks and I can tell there is a mutual respect there. And it feels nice to get respect from someone.   I wonder if she knew me better, would she still respect me. All my instincts (which have failed me before) tells me that she would. I wonder if I should ask her on a date. That would be so weird. I can not imagine me and L sitting there at a dinner table, trying to search for what to say. Both wondering to ourselves if this is a good idea or not. I would try and be funny, but there would be so much tension it would be hard to get laughs. Even still, I wonder if she would say yes, just to see if there is something there. I wonder if she knew me better would she like who I am. I wonder if I could even think of her tenderly.   We sure do make good friends.

      On July 1, 2004 the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft fired its main engine to reduce its speed, allowing the spacecraft to be captured by Saturn's gravity and enter orbit. The spacecraft began a four-year tour of the ringed planet, its mysterious moons, the stunning rings, and its complex magnetic environment.  During the Saturn Tour, Cassini will complete 74 orbits of the ringed planet, 44 close flybys of the mysterious moon Titan, and numerous flybys of Saturn's other icy moons.    urlLink Saturn Today   ---------------------------  Doesn't Rhea look just like our moon?

      As an American I am asked to pay taxes, obey the laws, and vote. I am sure there are some other things in there, but those are some big ones. Well, the next presidential election is coming up and I need to decide who to vote for (not that it matters because Massachusetts will vote Kerry either way). So I ask myself, "How did the president do the last 4 years?"  Well, that is a complicated question, and many people think many different things. But I like to break things down to very very basic fundamentals that I know are true. For example, I can not watch Fahrenheit 9/11 and make a decision on that, because (although making some great points) I do not know if what he proposes is true or not. Just because it was in a so-called "documentary", that does mean that I have to believe, or that I should believe it. On the other hand, I shouldn't believe the other side when people say that everything in that movie is false and made-up. Well, that doesn't matter anyway because I am not using any of that to make my decision.  This I do know is true (and I can not find anyone to tell me different):  Our military, our "boys", my personal friends, are in another country right now fighting a war that I can not find justification for. War is bad. It is the worst element of mankind. We are killing each other. Killing loved-ones. Killing somebody's father, son, … daughter. In this case, destroying cities and wrecking families. Families who have done no wrong. American mothers are crying because they lost their only son, or husband. Families are being raised in America without a parent, because we decided to go to war.  All of this is happening, and I can not tell you why. I do not see any threat we have abolished. I do not see the WMD's that Colon Powell showed us on CIA satellite photos. I do not see barrels of toxic poison which Saddam was planning on releasing into America. Or giant missiles aimed towards Massachusetts. Or even ties to the Taliban. They told me that Iraq was a threat to America, and that is why we have to go to war. Nobody has convinced me that Iraq was a threat. (*think to myself* There are no WMD's!? Of any kind!? At all!? Are you f-ing kidding me!?)  And what do we have now? Just a beat up country, who hates us, and wants us to leave them alone. Who wants us to stop killing them. But we can not do that, because that would be more inhumane, to come in wreck a country without a good reason, and leave without helping the innocent citizens of Iraq to rebuild their ruble. The only possible valid reason for this war is to remove a tyrant from a position of power, but I do not see that a good enough reason to go do what we did, not in this case.  So, what can I do about what I see as a travesty. Nothing really, but I hold our elected "Commander & Chief", the current President of the United States, our leader who we gave our power to, responsible for this. After all, it was his final decision to send in our glorious military. He may have had bad intelligence, he may of acted appropriately under the circumstances, and he may have had every best intension to do the right thing. But I don't think it was the right thing, and as an American I have the right to hold him accountable for the bad decisions. Whether he admits they were bad decisions or not. If it was the CIA's fault, well, there is nothing I can do about that, I wish I could vote for the CIA as well. But the only power I have to my vote, and the only vote I can cast is for the president.   So unless someone can convince me that that our military is in Iraq fighting a war right now that is justified, then I can not vote to re-elect the man who did this. The man responsible for all of this unnecessary death and destruction. Only problem is … John Kerry … Jesus Christ, give me a break!

      I am looking forward to the day when:  People don't dare talk down to me. I can do what I want without catching any grief. I have a productive work atmosphere. I have a girlfriend who challenges me, but is not a challenge to me. I don't have to worry about money. I have no boss, just co-workers. I am considered an expert in what I do. When I don't have to deal with dickheads who think they know more than me. I am not treated like a fucking kid because I look young. People start to see that I understand so much more than they give me credit for. I am treated with more respect.   How can I get these things? I think I need an original idea that I can make money off of. I know everyone is looking for that. Unfortunately, I know none of this is going to happen while I am working at my current job. (Except for the maybe the girlfriend thing). But I tell you, if one more person talks to down to me, like I don't what they are talking about, I am going to tear their head off. It is not my fault that they do not know how to communicate what the hell they are talking about. Morons. What happened to the days when I had respect from my peers. Dumbasses don't know anything.   I am driving to PA this weekend. 12 hours there and 12 hours back. I think I will think about the 5340RF (a machine at work) and come up with an original idea that will help everyone. Then I will come back from the long weekend, stay at work at night, and work on this idea. I say at night, because then I do not have to deal with everyone else's bullshit. And then I will break it loose a few weeks later, and everyone won't know what to say. They will say to themselves  "Jesus, I really underestimated that kid" .  Fuck them, these assholes don't know anything.
