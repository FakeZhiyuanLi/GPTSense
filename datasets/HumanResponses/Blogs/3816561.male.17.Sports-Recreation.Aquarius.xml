      Fading fast into what I thought was real Crashed and burned and broke the seal Of your approval on how I live And treat my loved ones when I misgive  The information's wrong, and the number's fake But take me in and forgive me for old time's sake Don't turn away again and leave me breathless Where I'll have to claw for air against the curses Don't leave me alone and grow your fame Among the masses while I lay here maimed..  Why do you resort to hiding the obvious When I can plainly see it's never the truth You'd love to think you could play me as an instrument But your thoughts are astray and you caught what I meant  Your "maturity" of late seems to be more juvenile Than I ever was when I went into my denial And blatantly slashed away at the figurehead You stand for...the love and lust you made of regret  I held back from your eyes like black caverns of dark Through which only the brightest light can be sparked By the embers of the dying fire I'm still kindling in me And will keep forever more until you decide to leave  But the past will catch up to me, eventually or now I don't think that I'm prepared for this, I just don't know how I could get beyond the whisper of your name in the breeze The confident air you have when you say mine with ease  Your feelings have changed and I can't tell if they're deformed Though I know the way they've changed has made me intrepid Resolute I am but still I falter at the grace of your touch And that thought..my dear..is simply just too much     And that is titled "Falling Upon A Blade". Fun stuff. I was listening to three songs the entire time I wrote this, and they are "Broken", "Silhouettes", and "Pulmonary Archery", by Seether, Smile Empty Soul, and Alexisonfire respectively. I was also talking to my ex, Michelle, and it was..interesting, to say the least, but I'm proud of the work that came from those feelings and thoughts. I'm trying to be better for her. I'm trying to be mature about it, and I want to be there to help her when she's down. I just hope I'm strong enough.  So, I went to Warped Tour on Saturday, and lemme tell you, Senses Fail was fookin awesome. It rained while they played but it didn't matter, and my best friend's girlfriend said she was getting into the band because I was into them so much. Love them. Warped was pretty good, cept when I got seperated from my group and went to get some food. I met a few friends from school and one of them was a girl I'd had a minor crush on for maybe..the last semester or so. Hung out with her and then found Matt, he found Kevin and them, and we all stayed for..oh, maybe an hour after, then we left.  I wanted to see Bad Religion, but they played after we left *pout* "I want, to conquer the world, give all the idiots a brand new religion!" I love that song.  So..in other news, Spider-Man 2 comes out tomorrow and I can't wait! I've been wanting to see this for so long now. I can't wait to play Spidey-2 as well. YEAAAH!  Comin' in a million broken miles..like poison for my veins..  So, this ends another edition of a day in the life of me. Now be a bullet laced in anger as the razor cuts the soft spot on your heel.
