      Many people always asked me about my Hong Kong experience and are intrigued on who/what/how and why I ended up there- what I did/learned ..so here is my story..(Oh and the title will not make sense until future entries..)sorry in advance for the poor spelling and grammar..  It was 1996/Economy was stagnant ..well you know.....I had been in NYC for 6 years and was bored! I had played the bar and club scenes, dated and had a blast..now I was ready for the big NEXT in my life.  FAST TRACK BACKGROUND  I was working as a designer at a large American fashion brand and ready to escape...I loved the people  and  worked with all very talented people(even the girl who brought in a lock her boyfriends bleached blod hair and pinned it on her wall, of course  you can imagine how that relationship ended- another story!but we follow up with Ms Wong later in HK!)...The owner of the company a Diva in her own right was very inspiration and a prefectionist! No problem whatever she wanted we would do...she called the shots...Unfortunately so did my immediate boss(Andrea Stein)/ crap love life/overly agressive and always needing encouragement(a tad insecure)..well ever monday morning I had to sit with her and listen to her weekend sexual escapades  in detail - drawing diagrams of how the guy went down her  etc/use you imagnation...actually she did that part  outside the fitting room while waiting for it to vacate! And of course If she wasnt by her phone and it rang I had to answer it incase it was the weekend man calling...and if they didnt call right away she was an emotional wreck and on edge..you know the fashion types... Of course this wasnt a bad experience, just one of the many memorable experience of my life working in NYC before Hong Kong.  I got a call from a head hunter (Samantha Page- Sam for short) one day informing me that she had sent my resume to a company overseas who was interested in seeing some of my work..could she send it to them, but she couldnt tell me about the company/location until she got confirmation they were interested....Of course that night I fell asleep with visions of working in a design studio on London, Paris or Milan.... A week passed and Sam called me to tell me they liked my work very much and would like to talk to me on the phone..I was so excited...Europe I am nearly there...Not so quickly..actually The company was based in Hong Kong!!! Well there went my gradoise idea of living and woking on Europe..WOW ! I had never been to Hong Kong...nor partic new much about Asian Culture(that would be evident later on...more later)..I had nothing to lose ..of course I would talk to them... I talked to a Ms Elaine Chan, HR Director and Alex Wong, Design Director of this Asian private label retailer called GENERATIONS(GAP of Asia!) I was excited and interview went very well...explained to them my background/work and experience...A few days later I called a call and was advise they wanted to meet me immediately and that I was on their short list and to do a present a project to them..Only problem was  they wanted me to come to HK within the next two weeks.  I was so excited and on an adrenaline rush that I pulled together a very strong project, as well as, now I dont recommend this in all circumstances, but I left for HK without telling my boss I wanted time off...just got up in the morning called her told her I needed to take a few days off due to a death... I didnt look back..within 20 hours I had arrived in Hong Kong...it was nightime and all I could see was the lights...Got to the 3 star hotel in Kowloon/ a fax was waiting for me to explain my itin for the next two days...store visit and mtg scheduel...I got up in the early  morning as sun was setting and asked the concireg how I got get to the Victoria Harbor to see Hong Kong Island...Kowloon(Tsim Sia Tsio) was  already awake..it was like a large flower blooming....things were just opening and moving all around me..Well I found my way to the Harbor (where many elderly and not so were doing Tia Chi- Asian Stretching exercise.  I was not prepared to see what I did that morning...When I looked across the harbor I saw this shinny/modern dynamic metropolis- the energy was bouncing off its skyscrappers...one more futuristic than the other - HSBC Bank Bldg, China Bank Bldg/ Luxury high rises of Midlevels and Happy Valley and the peak with its huge mansions perched on the side...This is the only second time in my life that I felt something special stir inside me....First time was my first visit to NYC on Earth Day 1990(interviewed for exec training program with Lux retailer )and now in Feb 1996  I  had this feeling again ..but this was different, this time my talent brought me here ..So how did the interviews go..well one week after I got back from HK I had a job offer and two weeks later I started working for Generations as  Designer Manager...My first day on the job was at Premire Vision (Europes largest fabric/trend show)..From that day on my life would not be the same ever again...  PARIS -   stay tuned for more when I have time to write..

      As we all know we live in  a world where we are always seeking the next thing...We always want to just get there..life is forever moving at warp speed - So what I am trying to get at...well I am a successful creative professional who is looking and searching for all things that will make me happy..The only problem is that I dont know what makes me happy..nice toys, beautiful apartment , cute dog ..boyfriend..friends..travel..designer clothes...trendy restaurants...relaxing asia inspired Music(listening to now...from Kee Club in HK demo CD)...Manadrin Oriental...Phucket Beach....yoga..pilattes....weights....Kabbalah, Buddism...the list is endless, but havent found the right combination..That is not to say I am unhappy..but I feel there is something in my life that is missing.... Just spent a month in Asia..mostly work, but took a week off to hit the beaches of southern thailand with  a friend- friend ended up not being able to make it...bought a bogus 1st class ticket from a miles dealer via the web etc..but that is another story... So needless to say I spent a week in a a 5 star beach resort  ALONE! Although the place looked like Paradise it was hardly so...I am not sure how many of you have gone on vacatin alone....usually its is no prob for me..althought I dont do it that often..but this one was different...The next day  I got up and went for breakfast - ALONE - no prob do it all the time when I am travelling and kind of like it..Still weened on to my Blackberry it was my only companion...Any walked into a room full of couples ..mostly newledy weds..Here is me this good looking(well I happen to like myself) 30's something sitting all alone with my blackberry to talk too..It kind of made me insecure..were they all looking at me..indeed they did when I walked in...but were they talking about me..feeling sorry for this single guy..Actually they need not, but I did feel alone...by myself with no one to share this moment with ..to laugh and comment about th eother couples in the room.  The beach and pool was no different..Thank god I could order lunch to my lounge chair etc....I realized I needed to make the best of the situation in being alone ..Opened up the Book on the Kabbalah ( the one Madonna recommened-OK so I am gay!) and began to read...By the second morning I decided to ditch the Blackberry(locked it in the safe) and went to breakfast relaxed and alone.. But this time I didnt care so much...besides I had my spiritual reading- oh and did I mention that I rotated the reading with The Davinci Code which I had copie dteh audio version onto my Ipod/got up to chap 40/guys voice annoys me/esp when he mimics women's voices!-- The nite before went to bed early...One thing that really bothered me about the hotel and others I have been to in the past is that they dont cater to SIngles and/or getting people to meet each other....Needless to say the yoga class never happened as it couldnt get up to 6 people to participate - MInd u by the looks of the people at the hotel they never worked out!! Ok so I am being a little bitchy, but it is true! Anway  I decided to take things into my own hands and arranged for the next two days to have private lessons - NO i am not a yoggi! but thought it would help me relax and it did...also helped me get rid of backpain....another story! So I layed in the sun/ took long walks on the beach/yoga/read/lunch at neighboring hotel Aman Puri  and lots of sleep- and one trip into Patong(maninparty hub of Phucket).  Luckily I had one friend(ex-trick from Shanghai) whom I hooked up(had sex) with a few times...Athough by the second time we hooked up I realized we had nothing in common...Also felt guilty as the manager of the hotel was his boyfriend..I guess the manager knew what was going on..as wasnt so friendly..Anyway dont blame him/ Agan another story... So within 4 days I had finished the book on the Kabbalah(th eone Madonna recommended!), was very relaxed and started to realize the guy I had recently broken up with in NYC was not such a bad catch..sure he had his problems, but compared to all the crazies I met during my month in Asia..(more later)was not so bad afterall... Maybe give it another go..So my mission was accomplished ..on the 5th morning I woke up and walke dintop breakfast and realized that after being at the hotel for 4 full days not one guest had said a word to me - although everyone was too much into themselves..By noon I was at the pool..and it was very hot...but not wanting to jump into the pool because there were 3 not so attarctive couples making out all at each end of the pool...It would not look good if I started doing laps inbetween/... At that moment I realized I need to get the fuck out of this paradise and back to reality..My flight was not our of Bangkok until Sunday so I could have the weekend in Bangkok...I immediatley called the Sukhothai (Lux boutique hotel Thai style) and get a weekend special rate..arrange my early departure and left..The minute I landed in Bangkok I felt I was no longer alone... I was back in civilization for single people...No time to waste I checked into the hotel(of course a limo picked me up at the airport) / unpacked and organize my itin for the the evening/ I called a friend who live sin Bangkok, but was out of town in Beijing..he advised me  of two places to go...Telephone and DJ station...The hotel was 5 minutes by Taxi from the Gay areal..and the minute I got there I felt I  was no longer alone... and what happened the rest of the nite is another story!   But going back to the begining I may not know what makes me happy, but I will say one thing being happy  at that moment was to be around fun/positiv energy..something I did not find in my stay in Phucket nor in the Kabbalah - but pls dont think I am shallow...I am still looking for more....
