      I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, a lot of bothersome, head-hurting, not-enough-booze-in-the-world thinking, and I just might be depressed.&nbsp; Not just over this nonsense with Rainy, although that's plenty depressing on its own, but the larger picture, life in general. I haven't been really happy in a long time, I generally feel like I'm plodding through life doing what I'm meant to be doing without being able to enjoy most of it. Moving into the apartment was a nice pick-me-up, I felt better for a while there. Then I got the new job, and new things usually kind of bring me out of a slump. Other than that, I've been going through the routine of living without really feeling like I am. I've been so stressed out, having to find the new job, and then the madness of working 70 hour weeks between the two jobs, and getting sick and having doctors' bills and all that. I started having panic attacks again, and drinking a bit more heavily than&nbsp;I can claim is healthy. And the things I think when I'm drunk, when I'm honest with myself, worry me. I'm either setting myself up for another fine life fuck-up, or I need to make some serious changes to the&nbsp;life that I am currently living.&nbsp; I've already changed a lot of things, in the hopes that it's a smaller thing that's been bringing me down, because I've been aware of these less than happy feelings since before we moved into the apartment. I thought maybe I was depresessed because of my job at the video store, so I quit. I thought maybe I needed a change of scenery so I moved to Connecticut. That was miserable. I moved back home because I was even more depressed out there than I was at home. I got&nbsp;a new job, and that wasn't really good either. I figured maybe I was depressed because I was living in the basement again; I'd felt better about the living situation in Connecticut but being so far away from my family and Jasmine brought me down, and working in warehouses was awful. So we moved into the apartment, and that was a little better at first, but I still felt depressed, and lacked any motivation for sex. No sex drive is not something I can live with. So, I stopped taking the pill, since that's notorious for causing loss of libido and&nbsp;I don't&nbsp;need to take it anymore anyway. Things have gotten a little better since then, but I still feel... disinterested. I'm running out of possibilities for what is making me unhappy. So maybe it's chemical, I am bi-polar and unmedicated. I have health insurance now, so I guess I'll try and find a therapist and see how that goes. But since&nbsp;I want to give therapy a sincere try this time around, I need to find one who is kink and queer friendly, and that complicates things all the more. There's no point in talking to a therapist who isn't going to understand the situations I'm in.  I've been thinking lately that I want to move closer to my family, to be near Dev. I'm finally in a place in my life, maturity wise, where I think I could have&nbsp;a positive influence, if I were around more often. It's taken 8 years for me to reach that point, and I think it would be good for the both of us. But there's Jasmine to think of, and jobs, and living spaces. Money gets in the way of absolutely everything that I want to do. I can't afford an apartment on the South Shore, Jasmine just started working for this new company last year and wouldn't be willing to move down there with me, I don't even know if I want her to. I think I may have rushed into my relationship with her in the beginning, I've been living with her pretty much since my mom kicked me out, when I was 20 and still not done growing up. We've been planning on getting married, but now I'm having second thoughts. I don't know if it's the right thing, I don't know if we are going to stay together. She loves me completely and wants to be with me forever... I'm having doubts. I just don't feel the same way that I did before, maybe it's just that love can't be burning and passionate forever, but I feel less in love with her. I love her very, very much, but I don't know if I'm in love with her. I want her in my life always, but I don't know if I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I can't bear to tell her how I'm feeling, I don't want to hurt her again. I've gone back and forth on this so many times over the last six years. I've broken up with her a couple of times, only to get back together a couple of days, sometimes a week or two, later. Always when I'm very depressed. I assumed in the past that it was that whole fucking my life up impulse, the desire to destroy anything good that I have so that I can sink into my depression, but this is different. This isn't world crushing, wrist slitting depression. This is just a general unhappiness with my life. I don't want to put her through all that again, breaking her heart. But I'm not happy. I've been trying to fix every other thing that could possibly be wrong, in the hopes that something is causing me to be depressed which is causing me to feel unhappy with our relationship. I think I said something to that effect once, without coming out and saying that the final possibility is our relationship. I said it had to be something, whether it's situational or chemical, and I was working on finding the cause. Things ar so complicated now. If we break up, I don't think we should live together. I've been on the North Shore all this time because we've been together and this is where she lived and now it's where we work. If we weren't together, I would want to move back closer to my family, I'd probably have to live with them while I get situated down there, which would be a disaster. Dev would want me to stay there and not move again, my mother and I cannot coexist peacefully in the same home, and there's really no place for me in that house anymore. Jasmine would be left with this aparment, which she says she can't afford on her own. If it weren't for her credit card debt, much of which is my fault, she could afford this place easily. I'd feel terrible, making her move into this place and then taking off... she's due for a promotion at work, if it comes with a raise that will make life easier. I jus don't want to hurt her any more.&nbsp;I don't know what to do. I've been trying to make this work for about 2 years. Sometimes things are good, and other times I just want to run away from all my thoughts. I go through times where I feel&nbsp;I want to be with her forever until the world ends, but somehow I always come back to this, feeling it's not meant to be. So, I'll try therapy and maybe that will fix what's wrong, my brain has never been very good at producing the happy feelings, maybe I need to be medicated. Maybe I should drink less. We'll see, I suppose.

      The comic is pretty good, it seems to be only the beginning of a story. The art is splendid, I bought 2 copies so I can pull out some of the pages and use them as posters. It's a very large magazine about 4x the size of a normal mag. so the full page illustrations will work nicely as small posters. It's an odd magazine, more like a photo book (mainly ads) than an actual magazine. Lots of pretty people, and nudity, which was a nice surprise.  Going into Harvard is like being bombarded with input, there are all the people, the sights, sounds and smells, so familiar to me, that bring back so many memories of summer nights howling at the moon. I walked around a bit, some of the shops have changed and I couldn't find the comic book store I'd wanted to go to. I was accosted by a young man who wanted to discuss the Democratic agenda with any young people who would listen, he tried to get my phone number, for purposes related to his cause he claimed, but I balked at that and gave him the email address I never use and rarely check. I wish I had time to become involved in politics and pressing for social change, but I barely have time to work and sleep. There are so many causes I'd like to be able to take up but I just don't have the time, energy or attention span to be an activist.&nbsp; I picked up a copy of the local homeless newspaper, Spare Change, on my way out. I didn't have time to read all of it on the ride home, I'll go through it after I shower. It was icky hot out there today, and I like a fool thought the overcast sky meant it might be cool.

      Foolhardy as I am, I'm heading in to Harvard Square on a shopping mission today. My objective: aqcuire a copy of Vol. 29 of V magazine.  When I called yesterday, I believe the man I spoke to said they did in fact have it in stock at the Out of Town News, but I was a little unsure as he had a thick accent from I'm not sure where. So, why oh why would I go into the city on the last day of the DNC for a silly fashion magazine? "The Return of the Thin White Duke", that's why. A fantasy comic written by Neil Gaiman, illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano featuring the image of David Bowie as the title character. Those 3 names make this comic worth braving my way on the T, which I have come to hate, to go into Harvard Square, which I have fond memories of, to take ten paces out of the terminal to that overstocked little newstand in search of a damn fashion magazine. I may poke around in some of the other shops once I've aqcuired my magazine; my collected copy of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac has gone missing and I want to read it again.  Emotions update: I've almost become angry enough at the situation with Rainy to tell him to fuck off and not bother calling. If he were any kind of friend to me, he wouldn't be so willing to drop me for a girl who's showing the early warning signs of spousal abuse. I don't know if he's aware that's what trying to control who he sees and talks to is, so I may have to talk to him again just to point out that fact. Nice, normal, stable people don't check their significant others' email behind their backs and block incoming mail from their friends. They've started going to councelling, which is a step in the right direction, but clearly I am not their problem, not the only problem, anyway, because if I were they wouldn't need councelling. Making me go away would have been fix enough, which I knew it wouldn't be. Of course, if this is a bad-control type relationship, he may be already too mired in it for my trying to enlighten him to do any good. Probably, it'll drive a wedge into whatever friendship we actually had left. But, as a friend, it is kind of my job to try. At this point I just kind of want this mess to be over and done with, I'm tired of thinking about it. I may attempt to actually talk to her, see if a more amicable solution can be reached between the two of us, but I'd be surprised if she hasn't blocked communicae from me to her. Out of respect for Rainy I was holding my tongue after the one email I sent to her, despite seeing her online everyday, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of respect being passed my way, so we'll see. I'm not really one to just sit back and take things like this. A good friendship, like the one we had, will always be worth fighting for, and I'm not quite ready to admit defeat.

      Well, I had quite a lengthy ranting post done out but I guess the blogger erases things if you accidentally put a . in the time spot. Rather bothersome, and I was just finally getting to a point, and feeling like it wasn't a complete waste. Some angry words, machismo and a lot of grumbling. I don't remember it all. The essential sentence was: There's really no contest, a choice between a girl he'd fucked in the past and the woman he is currently fucking and wants to continue fucking. Not much of a surprise in retrospect.  And there was a lot of babble about a photograph with the words "I think about you all the time, but I don't need the same..." written on the back. There's been no great spans of time that I've gone without thinking of him, I find reminders of him everywhere; the Cure plays on the radio, there are Subway shops around where I live now, every other customer at the convenience store has bad teeth. The way the air smells after it rains in the summer. Guitar. His picture, safely in my wallet these last 5 years. I doubt if he's got a photograph of me anymore. I really only have the one, that I can find. The one that goes everywhere with me. Before there was a picture of Jasmine and I, or even of&nbsp;Dev, in my wallet there was a picture of him. I'm so tired, I don't want to think anymore.

      I don't even know where to begin. As far as I know, the whole mess started a couple of days ago, when I chatted briefly with Rainy online. We'd been lovers, years ago, and good friends ever since. He moved away to Colorado four years ago, and we kept in touch. I went to visit him once, which was a disaster. I was all out of sorts emotionally, I'd broken up with Jasmine shortly before the trip and in hindsight it was so I could have sex with him, which I did. Things were hard between she and I when I came back, but eventually smoothed out and we've been back together and happy pretty much ever since.  Anyway, Rainy asks me if I got the email that Mel, his fiance, sent me. I hadn't, so I check my email and there is a link to the pictures of their trip out East. I curse at him for not telling me he was coming home. We usually spend a couple of hours together, just having a meal and talking, when he comes home once a year. This time around, I was really hoping to meet Mel, as he's intending to marry her and I wanted to get to know her. It seems to me now that her sending me that email was basically her way of saying 'See, he's mine, and you can't have him.' He and I hadn't spoken much in the past few months, so it seems like she must have been holding in some pretty unpleasant feelings if she felt the need for such a dig. I understood, I thought, when he explained that she was uncomfortable with him seeing me. I was a bit put out, hurt, but understanding. He tells me he wants to know what I've been up to and what's been going on with me, but he has to go, so email him. I do. I give him the run down on everything that's happened in recent memory, and discuss the issue of Mel not wanting me to see him. I don't hear from him for a couple of days. I get an email from Mel, quoting from the email I'd sent Rainy, basically asking why we can't just let the past be the past and not keep in touch. I'm furious, naturally. I write a long well composed response, explaining what friendship is, that he and I aren't intimate anymore, that she's got no business telling him who to be friends with and I ohsogently explain that she's got trust issues. I attempt to blind copy the email to Rene, and that's when things get interesting. She's blocked emails from my account to him. Realizing that, I call him. She answers the phone, so I know she's there. He's basically limited to yes or no answers to keep her from guessing that it's me.  "Did you forward the email I sent you to Mel?" No. "Why is Mel emailing me, quoting from the email I sent you?" I don't know. "Did you block emails from me on your account?" No. "Have you gotten any emails from me in the past week?" One. "You need to have a little chat with your girlfriend, I'm pretty upset." I'm sorry. "Are we still friends?" Yes. "Are you sure? Absolutely definately we are still friends?" Yes. "Good. It's good to hear your voice again." (Silence) "I'll talk to you later."  I felt better, he was still my friend and things would work out.... And then, they didn't. He sends me a long email telling me how great a friend I've been to him, basically listing all the reasons why we should stay friends, but because he wants to marry this ... girl, he can't. And please don't call him. He'll call me once more if I need to talk about this. I'm too forgiving. I write him back a long, rambling D-style email, telling him that he's hurt me, he's foolish and that sooner or later he'll realize the mistake he's made and we'll pick up where we left off. I think I'm even nonchalant about it. My heart is breaking, my girlfriend is upset and I'm sure she's worrying that I'm still in love with him and ready to leave her to go try and win him back. She's insecure too, but tolerably so. Endearingly so. And I have to admit, where Rainy is concerned, I've given her reason to be. I've basically cheated on her with him four times. The first three times we were technically not a couple, one of those times I don't even know if she knows about as we were so drunk that half the time I don't remember that it happened. The last time was the mess in Colorado, where I had broken up with her, but really, it counts. That's the big one, really, me flying halfway across the country to go fuck someone else. I wonder sometimes why she stayed with me after that. I'd proven so untrustworthy. Maybe she's too forgiving, too.  So now, I wait. I wait to hear back from him. I feel like I'm seventeen again. Obsessed, depressed and half crazy over all this. And then there's the *snip*  other bit. That added on top of everything else... it's actually what I've been most upset about today. Fuck Rainy; I've had some misinformed ideas about somethings, and it's fucking with my head now. *snip*  It was towards the beginning of our relationship; Jasmine was supposed to hang out with Rainy and I but ended up spending time with her ex, who was not keen on letting her go to me. *snip*  Meanwhile, I think I've been blown off, I can't get Jasmine to answer the phone anymore and I become enraged. I go off to meet Rainy, in a fury, and we go to a motel to fuck. This was the first time we'd had sex. I've felt bad about it, bad for both of them, pretty much ever since. I put Rainy in a very awkward situation, I think he might have been afraid to refuse me, though he tried, and even though we were still  technically  not a couple, I felt like I'd cheated on Jasmine. I'd never had that feeling before, that awful I've-done-something-wrong feeling. When I found out later what the situation was, I felt even worse. She'd sort of downplayed it at the time, told me that what happened wasn't exactly consensual, but skirted around certain details which, having recently learned them, have pitched me into a whole new depth of feeling like an asshole.  Jasmine and I are kinky. I'm the dominant one, she is thoroughly submissive. On occasion, I rather enjoy to beat and slap her until she cries, it's a big turn on for me, fucking her while she cries. One of those occasions was less than a week ago. Now, I have this awful, icky feeling over it. I know what goes on between us is consensual, she reassures me of that from time to time because I tend to become frightened of my own sadistic side. I like to take things to a very deep level. But, when all of this happened, these things so long ago, it would seem the person who attacked her felt it was consensual, up to a point. And she wants so much to please me, how can I really know how much she enjoys and how much she tolerates for my pleasure? I feel like a monster. I'm a monster and my longtime best friend doesn't want to know me anymore.  I've been thinking so much on this lately, I can't help but wonder if it's for the best that Rainy and I sever our ties.... There is so much history between us. That's both a reason for and against, I suppose. I've known him longer than most of the rest of the people I now call friends. We have such a comfortable way between us. We see one another only once a year, but it feels like we just pick up where we were last time, as if it had only been a day. We went to a bar one year, and out to breakfast the next, and it could have been the next morning from the way it felt. I've just loved him so long, I can't bear to think that I won't ever know him anymore. I just feel wretched. We were so very close, and shared so much with each other, good and bad. But then, he's also the person I tend to cheat on my lover with. Granted, that was a long time ago and the feelings I have for him aren't really sexual or romantic... but then, they weren't the last time, either. I don't know. I just want the world to stop. I want to cut. I swear, it's this fucking haircut. I changed my style back to what it was when I was sixteen or seventeen, long on the top and shaved around the sides. I've invited drama back into my life by cutting my hair. I'm so tired. I want to stop thinking, and feeling, and being a damn drama queen.   *Note: The *snips*  are bits I edited for privacy, after thinking on things for a while. I'm not likely to forget them, and strangers stumbling upon my diary don't need to know the whole story.

      I want to piss on Trent Reznor. Not just piss on him, but conquer him. I want to find him, tackle him, beat and whip him until he's bloody, tie him up and fuck him  like an animal,  and when he's lying bruised and quivering on the floor, I want to piss all over him to mark him as my conquest and leave him sobbing and stinking. His music is so powerful, so overwhelming, it compels the spirit to&nbsp;new heights. He seems so charismatic, so vibrant and strong. I just want to degrade and debase him. Make him beg for mercy. He needs to be overpowered. I want to be the one to do it.

      It seems I haven't drank nearly enough to have any thoughts. My mind is usually a jumble of worthless mess, but I hate to leave the just-started blog with nothing but a flat opener, so I guess I'll just&nbsp;reveal some of my favourite stories about the horrific things I've said or done. Stories about me never go out of style.  &nbsp;  I'll start with a story that emphasizes&nbsp;how egocentric I am. We throw parties about once a month, or had before I got sick and&nbsp;we went to LR. Anyway, at the one party that Behn came to, there was a good lot of us sitting around chatting, alcohol had been consumed, video games had been played and we'd reached the "let's see who can talk the loudest until everyone else gives up and just listens" portion of the evening. Normally, I win hands down because no one can talk incessantly without letting others get a word in edge-wise quite like I can. Behn was giving me a good run for my money as he is also accustomed to being the center of attention. I finished whatever the hell it was that I was rambling loudly about, and Behn interjected while I was taking a sip of my drink (sneaky bastard)&nbsp;to start a story that began something like, "I'll never ever forget the time D...." Many of Behn's stories begin this way, at least while in my presence, because I am clearly one of the most interesting people he knows. Anyway, it was as Behn began this story that I very happily announced, "Yay! We're talking about me again!" and then let him tell whichever of his favourite D stories he was starting. I have a keen desire to know what other people are thinking about me at all times and I'm equally delighted regardless of whether what they think is good or bad. All that really matters is that they're thinking of me. I don't particularly care what people think of me, so long as they are. To be forgettable would be a travesty.  &nbsp;  So, as for the story that Behn was telling, it might have been one of many, or many meshed into one. Amoung his favourites&nbsp;is the 'technically, they aren't people' comments I've made, so I'll explain that next.  &nbsp;  "Human beings have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46. In most cases of missing or extra chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, the infant dies not long after being born. The exception to the +/- chromosomes =&nbsp; death equation are persons with Down Syndrome. People with Down Syndrome have an extra chromosome number 21, and can generally live long and healthy lives, though typically with obvious defects and disadvantages. But, because they have 47 chromosomes instead of 46, they are technically not human... which makes it ok to eat them."  &nbsp;  Behn was always rather horrified by that thought, and assured me that I am in fact evil and going to Hell. Now mind you, I don't believe in Hell or any of that nonsense, but I will acknowledge being evil. Either way, he loves to tell that story.  &nbsp;  More recently, I heard about a family somewhere local to me who had a child that was sick in the hospital and died. Sometime after the death and autopsy of the child, his parents received notification from the hospital that they could have the remainder of their child's remains back. The hospital had, without the parents' knowledge or consent, kept most of the child's internal organs for additional testing and autopsies. The parents then had to pay for a second burial of their child because the child had already been buried and they wanted all of the body buried together. The parents are now sueing the aforementioned hospital for holding their child's innards without their knowledge or consent, causing them emotional stress, as well as adding the financial burden of a second burial. Having recently had some medical issues of my own, troubles concerning health insurance and medical bills and Free Care not picking up the tab for things I was assured they would, a thought occurred to me: If the child's health insurance expired when he did, and the hospital continued to do tests for weeks afterward, it's not impossible that his parents could receive a rather hefty bill for the autopsies, lab tests and doctor's fees for services performed after the child was deceased. If the health insurance is no longer valid after death, they could be facing a pile of bills for all of those unauthorized port-mortem tests. I nearly laughed myself sick at the thought how much worse that would make the whole ordeal.  &nbsp;  I'm determined that the extremely tender and delicious meat that Jumbalaya's uses for it's Buffalo 'Chicken' Strips is in fact breast-fed baby. It's just not chicken, chicken has never been so delightful.  &nbsp;  I think I may have consumed enough alcohol.

        I've contemplated on a number of occasions, generally while drunk, setting up a blog for the inane, melodramatic&nbsp;babble that spews forth from my mouth whilst intoxicated. So here it is.&nbsp; It probably won't be thoughtful or insightful or remotely interesting to anyone but me, but then, I am my own best and most favourite audience anyway.

      After talking to my Temptation a bit today, I've decided not to tell Jasmine what transpired this weekend. He thought it ill-advised, no good could come of it. He has no intentions of telling his lover about it, he said he's chalking it up to drunkeness,  something that happened and is done. In my conversation with him, I'd wished that I didn't have a conscience and could just pretend it hadn't happened... and shortly thereafter the guilt went away. I just stopped feeling it. I know already that this relationship is doomed, that she and I are not going to be together much longer, so why put her through added unpleasantness in the meanwhile by telling her about this. I feel some remorse over how calculating I'm being, thinking in terms of how much money I need to be able to strike out on my own, rather than how the next few months are going to affect her, the person. I feel badly that I'm going to keep such secrets so as not to disrupt my plans. That's just where I'm at in my head. I want to succumb to the evil in me, to stop caring about other humans and just exist for my own selfish pleasure. I want to fuck him again. I enjoyed it, I want it to happen again. I doubt if he feels the same, and would probably find the turnabout in my attitude alarming, at least, but we'll see what happens. I entirely accidentally left something behind, something that I'm hoping will go unnoticed until I can retrieve it; it's a bit of a telltale item. And I think I will attempt to retrieve it soon. Perhaps suggest drinks while I'm there. Something has finally snapped inside of me. I'm regressing back into the heartless, thoughtless monster I once reveled in being, rather than the crippled abomination I've become. But it's late and I'm still sleep deprived, we'll see if the remorse doesn't come back in a flood when I wake tomorrow. When I have to face her tomorrow night. But now I know, for certain, it is the relationship that is making me unhappy.

      Blogger is starting to piss me off. I had a huge post that got deleted because there was an error. Basically, I'm a fucking asshole and I cheated on my girlfriend, with a dear close friend of hers. It was a long story and I don't feel like typing it all again. There is something very wrong with me and I need to end this relationship before I hurt her anymore. I'm going to end up homeless and drifting from couch to couch. I hope she kicks my ass when I tell her because I fucking deserve it. I'm such a rotten bastard, I can't believe it.

      I had a long talk with Melissa tonight, just about this that and everything else. A lot about my past, as usual, the things I'm trying to let go of, about the death of relationships and the rebirth of people. I feel like I need to be alone for a while, unattached, and get to know myself as a human being. I need to be nearer to my son, and to find myself. To find the person in me. I think that I may be her about 5 years ago, the things I'm going through and the way I'm feeling. Her past is similar in a lot of ways to mine, and to my present. I told her how I feel about my relationship with Jasmine and she expressed some dismay, we are very good together and it's sad to think that it may not be working out. She had a very similar experience in her relationship with Jenne, needing to find herself and not be defined through her relationship. We talked about taking lovers for granted, knowing that no matter what you do today, they will still love you in the morning. I just feel so all over the place. Last night I was content, today my head is full of unhappy thoughts. I don't want to put Jasmine through any more misery, any more of my indecision and confusion. But I need to feel happy. I am in need of repairs.  Devyn called me in tears tonight, he got in trouble at day camp. I didn't quite understand the whole thing, but I think he was being picked on and he lashed out, per usual. They sent him home with a note about it and my mother is being unbearable again. He's so unhappy, I just want to make it better. He won't talk about what's bothering him and he gets so angry when I try to persuade him to tell me. If he gets into trouble tomorrow, Mom says she won't let him come up for the weekend. I think that will only make things worse and I may take him regardless. He needs to spend some time away from all that. He got himself so worked up and upset that he got what sounded an awful lot like a migraine, from the way he explained it. Eight year olds should not get migraines, that's just not right. I need to do something for him, I don't know what, but something. I need to help him. I remember all the things he's going through; I had the exact same experiences at his age. Everyone hated me and I was always fighting and unhappy. Every morning I said I was sick to try and get out of going to school. I wanted to die all the time when I was there, I just wanted to lie down and not live any more. A child should never have to feel that way. I want to make his pain stop, if only for a weekend. Poor little Monkey.

      I came home last night at about 6:30 and Jasmine wasn't here yet. I messed around with my guitar, trying to fix it so the amp plug works right and the amp doesn't make a horrible feedback noise. I couldn't do it. On impulse, I went to the local guitar shop and bought a new guitar. It made me very happy. I have had my guitar since I was 12, I think it was about time for a new one anyway. Listening to the difference between the piece of crap I could afford to buy on a paper route and my new Ibanez, I'm glad I got it. The neck isn't so big that my little hand doesn't fit around it and the sound is just lovely. I spent about two hours practicing last night; I'm about to start in again in a little while. I'm just so happy to have music back in my life, to play and learn and make good sounds. Not that I'm smashing yet, but things are coming back to me, I'm remembering songs I used to know and learning more of them. It just relaxes me, I don't feel stressed out or worried while I'm playing. I'm focused and enjoying myself, for a change. I usually am so distractable, so disoriented, but everything seems clear when I have the guitar in hand. It's good for me, I wish I had taken it up again sooner. Or never stopped to begin with.  Part of the reason I wanted a new one was this whole letting go of the past business. That guitar has been with me, been abused by me, through so many little truamas, I wanted a guitar with no history. A fresh start. And, I wanted to own something that isn't black. Everything that I own pretty much is black; my clothes, my old guitar, my couch, my sheets, my hair, everything. I like black, I look best in black, it's simple and makes choosing things easy because I can eliminate anything not black. Don't even have to bother looking; it's not black, I don't want it. I wanted my guitar to stand out in my life. Everything else is dreary, I want it to be my shiny colourful beacon of hope. It's candy-apple red. I had wanted a bright purple, but the only purple guitar I saw in the store was over $500 and I didn't want to spend that much. I'm still not sure if this is going to be a lasting commitment or if I'm going to give up again in a few months. For right now, it's making me very happy. I'm working on relearning a couple of Nirvana songs, just about everything I used to know was by Nirvana, because I was obsessed, and they are ridiculously simple. It's basically the same three or four power chords at different locations on the neck. The hardest part is learning the rythym. I am rythymically challenged. I think I'll work on getting some of the simpler ones down, then maybe move on to some more current stuff, things from the White Stripes, maybe. Seven Nation Army doesn't sound very complicated. I feel so motivated, so inspired. It's almost disconcerting, I'm not used to enjoying being alive, having something to really look forward to. Dev is coming to stay with us Thursday night through Sunday, if he can behave himself at camp through the end of the day tomorrow. He's been behaving himself very well so far this week, according to my mother. It seems he's excited about getting to come up here for a few days, he's been on extra special good behaviour. I'm glad he's looking forward to seeing me.

      Well.. Rainy and I have said our goodbyes. He emailed me back tonight, telling me that it's good and healthy to let go and that sort of thing. Telling me that he does appreciate how good a friend I'd been. It feels sort of hollow. Not that I think he doesn't mean it, but just that I know that this has affected me a lot more deeply than it has him. I'm the over sensitive one, no matter how badass I try to pretend I am. He said that, too, that I'm sweet, as hard as I am on the outside, as tough as I try to be. I'm sweet and I'm good. I don't know if I believe that or not, but I know I feel pretty deeply and I suppose I might be sweet at times. I don't know. I still want to stop feeling, it's more trouble than it's worth. He said my initial reaction to his decision hurt him, which I really didn't understand. I thought I was pretty alright, I wasn't giving him a verbal beatdown or anything. I said I thought he was being foolish, that was about as bad as it got. I guess I didn't take it seriously, I figured he'd come to his senses. I still think he might, maybe not until years from now, but I think sooner or later he is going to realize that he ended a friendship he claims to have valued when it wasn't necessary. By then, he probably won't be able to find me even if he tries, which he won't because that's not the sort of person he is. That's the sort of person I am. Best just to lay it all to rest, I suppose. Keep on walking and never look back. I don't know what to do with all this emotion. I tried to play my guitar today, but I couldn't find my tuner and I can't tune by ear yet, so it just sounded awful. I spent about an hour fiddling with it, trying to tune it, I suppose that's better than not touching it at all. It needs to be fixed; the plug where the amp cord goes is still not connecting right, despite my best efforts. I had such a feeling of accomplishment and ambition when I figured out what was wrong with it and fixed it and had Jasmine solder the wires for me, but it's still not working right and I'm out of ideas. I may have to actually take it to someone for repairs and I'm not keen on that. It's my baby, I want to do it on my own. I'll have to give it another try tomorrow. Aside from the migraine towards the end of the night, works went well enough today. Not really a lot to comment on, I guess. I am starting to hate it when people ask what I've been up to because I really do just work, drink and sleep. There's not much to talk about. I went to the beach the other day, and dinner the other night, but there's not a lot to be said about that either. Or maybe I just don't think anything is noteworthy, I don't know. I need to sleep again.

      We went out to dinner last night, Jasmine, Dan, Jenne, Melissa and I. All in all it was a fun time... until sometime after midnight when things got more angsty. Dan had left and I went into one of my long soliloquoys about my tragic past and specifically about Behn. It had to do with why I don't miss drugs anymore; some of the funnest stories I have about drugs involve the time that I lived in Behn's bed and locked myself out of his room all the time without my shoes and wandered around his dorm high or drunk until I found people to be near. There was a lot of drama going on, Melissa and Jenne talking about things between them, in their past, and Jenne played some songs she had written about their breakup. She's really an amazing musician.  When Jasmine and I got home, we had some sort of conversation that was high in emotion and left me feeling drained and miserable. It had to do with the way that I desperately cling to people who are leaving my life, Rainy and Behn were mentioned by name. She tried to explain how unhealthy it is, the way I try to stay mired in my past, and that I tend not to appreciate the things that I have that are good because I'm too busy obsessing over the ones who won't love me. I've always been this way and I don't know how to change. I'm trying. The things she says differ a bit from the feelings that result in me. She's trying to help, to bring me out of this depression, I think, but what I hear is "you're a terrible, neglectful person." I always end up feeling like an asshole, no matter what happens or how good I try to be. I'm so defective. I'm still hanging on to all these miserable feelings, still feeling vindictive over things that happened more than half my lifetime ago. I can never get a happy feeling to stay, it always turns bitter and wistful, because I know that sooner or later I'll just be sad again, and knowing that brings the sadness on. I need to let go of the past, stop trying to dredge it up again and again. Let the people who drift out go where they will. I emailed Rainy saying as much, that I think it's time for me to let go and that I don't really think it's doing him any good to know me, that I don't think it ever did. I have so much guilt over the way things were between he and I for so long. I tried so hard to make him a villain, because I need villains to blame, but he's really just decent and sweet. I told him he doesn't need to bother with calling me, if he intended to, that it just time to move on. I'm going to miss him so much. I think I'll carry this pain quietly inside for a long time. Then, I cleaned up my phone book in my cell phone. Deleted Behn's numbers, he never answers or returns calls anyway. If he wants to find me, he knows where I am. He'll probably be glad that the incessant voice mails have come to an end. I just wanted him in my life so much, I was willing to let the times he had for me be only few and far in between. Jasmine says he mistreats me, dissapearing this way and causing me so much sadness. I think I do it to myself. I think I need that. To hurt myself all the time, and people are the tools I use to do it. I deleted Rainy's number as well, I won't be trying to contact him again. I had thought that maybe I'd stay out of his life except for his birthdays; in nine years I've never once missed his birthday, if all I did was to tell him to have a happy one. I'd thought maybe I'd just send him a box of dried roses on his birthdays, that's significant to our past. It's not a good idea, I know that now, and I won't do it. I'm done causing trouble for him, he needs to have a happy life without me fucking it up. I feel like I'll never be happy again. I need to sleep. I only got a bit of fitful rest before getting up for another 10 hour workday. I didn't really eat today either, I've got to start eating again, even if I don't feel like it. I have to make things better in my head, I don't know what I'll do if this gets worse. I'm holding so much in, I have so many little secrets, and no one to confide in. Sleep is important.

      Devyn got himself kicked out of travel camp for fighting. He'd been sent home with a warning on Friday, went in on Monday and got suspended, went back on Wednesday and was terminated from the program and suspended for the rest of the week. He starts regular camp on Monday. I took him to the beach on Friday, to get him away from my mother, and we had a lovely day together. It wasn't very warm out, but we went swimming in the cold ocean anyway; we had a lot of fun fighting against the waves and body surfing. It was one of the best days I've had in a long time. We just... played. It was good. I felt like a kid again, just me and him and the great wide water. I go to the beach so rarely these days, I don't know why. Water is my element and I've always loved the sea; the smell of salt and the crash of waves feels like home to me. It was just perfect. We went back to his house and played a game of chess, and he didn't throw a tantrum when I won. We played Jumanji and he won and it was all good. We just had such a good time, talking and being together. He makes me so proud, how intelligent and sensitive he is. And cunning. I think he got himself kicked out of camp on purpose. He said that he was glad in a way, because the other kids all hated him and he didn't want to have to see them anymore. I told him that wasn't the best way to go about it. Everything was great... until my mother came home. She's just such an insufferable bitch so much of the time. She started giving him trouble, ranting about how much trouble he's been causing and basically trying to make him feel bad. I think she does these things when she sees someone is having a good time. Whenever anything good is happening and she's not a part of it, she tries to ruin it. She's been this way since I was a child. Just mean. I tried to keep the peace, but she and I have never gotten along anyway, so she just turned her nose up. If she hadn't come home, it would have been perfect. Devyn told me that he wishes that he could always be at school when she's home and that she'd go to work at night when he's home. He never wants to be around her. I feel worse and worse about the situation every day.  I enrolled to take a night class in business math this coming semester. I'm looking forward to it. I need to learn things again. I need to excersize my brain.  While we were at the beach, I spent some time alone playing in the sand. I wrote Rainy's name, and Behn's name, in the sand and let the ocean wash them away. I've got to learn to let go. Rainy isn't coming back to me, and Behn rolls in and out like the tide. I can't expect to keep them anymore. So I'll let the ocean take them where it will. I'll just love them quietly in my heart and try to get them off my mind. It's better that way. Let go off the sorrows and the past and learn to live now. All is for the best, everything is as it should be in this, the best of all possible worlds.  I wish I could believe that.

      I'm feeling a bit better today, not as horribly down as I have been lately. I actually spent some time with Jasmine tonight, being  snuggly  shall we say, and it was good. I've still got these feelings, these hesitant not quite right feelings, but at the very least I'm not feeling the need to damage myself today. I got about 6 hours sleep last night, that might have helped. I've been working both jobs for a total of about 16 hours each day the last 4 days, and sleep has been hard to come by. The one night that I had the opportunity to sleep for more then 4 hours, I ended up sitting at the computer drinking beer and reading Dear Abby until about 3:30 when she woke up to pee and asked if I was ever coming to bed. She's trying to take care of me lately, make sure I get some sleep and eat things. I was telling her how depressed I've been feeling lately, without really getting into specifics, and I said that maybe it was my period. She said probably, since I get all depressed and miserable and melodramatic every month. I honestly hadn't realized. I knew that the bad times were cyclical, that I always come back to these bad feelings, and she said that every month I get horrendously depressed and rant about how horrible a person I am. She said I wasn't like this when we first met, but that over the course of the years she's known me my PMS has gotten worse and worse. I wonder if that is an effect of the pill; I wasn't taking it when we first met. When I get around to seeing a therapist, I'll have to mention that.  I emailed Mel the other night, to try and get her to talk this problem out with me. I emailed Rainy and told him I'd emailed Mel, and that he's taking too damn long to get back to me. I'm impatient and this is upsetting me. We'll see what happens. Mel is online now, I sent her an instant message but she hasn't responded. I don't think she will. At the very least, I've tried. My initial reaction was relatively relaxed, after the excessive crying. It surprises me that I told Rainy that things would work out and eventually he'd realize his mistake. That was a bit forgiving and relaxed, very unlike me. The current obsessing is much more my style. I'm actually pretty close to giving up. If he really cared he wouldn't be doing this anyway. I guess I can't always have what I want. It's just so unfair. And the irony of Rainy trying to respect the feelings of a person who clearly doesn't give a fuck about how anyone else feels... it's something. I should probably go to sleep now, I haven't been doing that enough lately. But I don't have anywhere I have to be tomorrow, so I can sleep as much as I want. I may have to babysit some cats, but that's about it.  I got the girl who lives downstairs a new cat, to keep her cat company. I happened to know someone who needed a home for his kitty because he can't take her where he is moving and Melissa has been badgered into getting another cat for Cleo to play with by her ex, so I picked up the cat today and brought it to her place. When I left her apartment earlier the cats didn't seem too keen on hanging out with each other, but we're hoping in a couple of days they will warm up to one another. If not, I may see if Jasmine's mum likes the new kitty. She's a skinny little thing, but fluffy. Soft grey fur in two shades, and a very sweet demeanor. She's the only cat I've ever taken in a car that didn't cry the whole time. She was obviously unhappy about it, but she didn't complain. If this doesn't work out, I don't know what I'll do about the kitty. Her owner is moving in two weeks, so that's not really a lot of time to find her another home. I would consider keeping her myself but she is long haired and that will just reak havoc with Jasmine's allergies. She's allergic to everything, but long haired cats are worse than short hairs. I want to get a Devon Rex, they are supposedly easier on the allergies. And they look like aliens.  I think I'll look up class schedules for the community college. I want to take a class, but I don't know what.

      I don't know why I keep putting myself through this, why I keep trying to cling to a past I know is dying. I'm so tired of people drifting in and out of my life; the ones I long to keep all seem to just float off into the ether.  Behn, Kayt, Rainy, Alex... there comes a point where it seems there's nothing left for us to say to one another and they just sort of dissapear. I know roughly where they each are, but they've ceased to be a part of  my  world. I tried to call Rainy, he wasn't home earlier and now his phone is busy. It was busy all last night, too. I called Behn again, left him a message just saying it's me and that I miss him. Over the past few months, I've left him a variety of messages, ranging from manic to depressed to angry, all telling him to call me. He won't, he's gone off the edge of the map again. I've gotten used to him dissapearing, and dissapointing me. Jasmine wonders why on earth I bother calling him a friend, his unreliability and tendancy to vanish are well proven. But when he comes back, when he's in my life again, he's such a delight to be around. He's a fop, an over dramatic, showy, self-absorbed fop, and I adore that in him. He's also been one of my closest confidants; one of those people I trust enough to tell my secrets who is removed enough from my day to day living that I don't feel like I'm burdening them with information that will plague them. When I've really needed him, he's been there for me. I need a friend I can confide in right now, and unfortunately none of my accessible friends are really ideal for that. They are all too close to Jasmine, or insensitive to all the subtle nuances of my heart. Behn lived through some very hard times with me, and took care of me when I needed taking care of most. He let me move into his dormroom when my mother threw me out in our freshman year of college, he kept making me eat and tried to limit my drug intake as best he could. He held me when I cried, and poured out all my misery over him, and like a gentleman rejected all of my desperate, depressed advances. I used to say I wouldn't have any friends if it weren't for the ones who refused to sleep with me. Without them, I'd have an even longer list of people I'd fucked and not spoken to again. It was Behn who first came up with the whole "D and the Technicolor Blowjob" bit. My standard greeting for a while was, "Hi, can I give you a blowjob?" No one ever said yes. I doubt I'd have done it if they had. It was a way to make myself grotesque to people, to thwart any possibility that they would be interested in me from the get-go. It worked fabulously, unfortunately. I think I may have missed out on a lot of good connections because I was defending against them preemptively. Behn had known me a little bit before all that began, before I set up camp at the commuter cafe hollering at random passersby to come watch me swallow things. I'd lost my gag reflex for a while there and had discovered that I could swallow chains and other long, flexible objects with relative ease. My favourite thing to swallow was Stink's wallet chain. It was a 26" chain, probably about a quarter inch thick and I could feed it down my throat and into my stomach. I could feel it in my belly if it was cold, which it usually was. Stink was another one I'd fucked, who I can only assume has forgotten me. It was Valentine's Day, he was someone else's boyfriend and we were having an anti-Valentines party that Friday the 13th that went well into the morning hours of the 14th. We talked about it once afterwards, we were both really stoned so I didn't understand most of what he said then, but I think it was something along the lines of thinking that I was really super keen and he wished he had met me before he fell head over heels in love with this other girl he was dating at the time, the one he cheated on with me that Valentine's Day. I've had that conversation with a few people; they think I'm super-neato-keen, but.... Behn's 'but' was that I reminded him of his exgirlfriend, who was also super-neato-keen, but crazy. Rainy's 'but' was that I was insane, I think. Fair enough. Melissa's 'but' was that I was a girl. Jasmine's 'but' was that she just got out of a bad breakup and she wasn't ready yet. She eventually succumbed to me, after months of my being attached to her at the hip, whether she liked it or not. She'd come home to her dorm and I'd be hanging out with her roommates waiting for her. She'd go to class and find me peering down or peeking around a corner at her. She'd go to meals and I'd be waiting at the door for her, usually to borrow $5 so I could eat, too. If she didn't answer her phone, or if the line was busy too long, I'd call her roommates and get them to tell her to get off the phone so I could call her. I stalked her, plain and simple, until she gave in. She was flattered by the attention, I don't think she'd dated anyone quite as unwell as I was. I wonder about that now, look back on it and I wonder if maybe she fell for me because she didn't have any other choice. She was fragile, from the breakup and just from being Jasmine, she's delicate on her own. She wasn't in a great state emotionally and I basically pushed my way into every aspect of her life. I held her hostage with my affections. She and I have talked about that, I've told her I doubt sometimes if she's in love with me or if it's that I took her in a frail state and forced my way into her life. She kept trying to tell me she didn't want a relationship, didn't want to date anyone, and I kept saying 'ok, we'll just fool around' and we'd fool around and spend all our time together, and eventually I think she just grew attached because there wasn't much other choice. She couldn't get rid of me so she learned to love me. It's that syndrome where hostages fall in love with their captors. She kept saying then that she didn't want to get involved again, that she never wanted to love again. When she finally confessed that she was in love with me, she told me that she didn't want to be, that she'd tried not to let it happen; she couldn't help but love me. I was  charming .  I'm such a wretched creature, I always have been.

      I'm sinking deeper into this depression, pushing myself into it, I think. I've been thinking too much, about too many different things. I've been listening to the Cure a lot, because it makes me sad about Rainy. Thinking about the past, and how I've been and what I might do in the future. I think sometimes that I just have to create drama, that I still, after all this time, just can't bear to let myself be happy, or at least content. I've had some worry constantly since we moved. Since forever, really, I'm always drumming up some sort of trouble, even if it's only trouble in my head and I don't let it out, or downplay it when I do let go. I've been thinking a lot about Jasmine, and my feelings and what to do. What would I do if she and I weren't together? I don't know if I would date again for a long time, I think I need to spend some time by myself, not defining my existence through another human being. I've always had an obsession, a lover or an unrequited love that I've followed around like some sad, wounded puppy. Jasmine has been the best companion I've ever had, the first person I think genuinely appreciates and loves me as I am, for who I am, and doesn't just keep me around for a warm body to fuck. That's probably unkind. I was more than that to Rainy, I think, but there wasn't that same love. We were great friends who fooled around once in a while. And it's not like most of the people I've been with sought out to hurt me. I kind of made it that way, wrapping myself around them whether they liked it or not, most of them just took me since I was offered. And I'm impossible to leave, I just don't allow it to happen. I'm just so needy, I've always needed looking after and taking care of and someone to blame for everything that's wrong with me. I'm just broken, I'm malfunctioning. Jasmine is the only person I've been with that I feel has improved me in any way. She's empowered me, and helped me find a bit of self-esteem. I love her dearly, but I feel like if something should happen to her, or should we break up, I could actually live without her. Not like I wouldn't care or that she doesn't matter, but that she's helped me become a strong person, one who doesn't necessarily need to cling to another for support and survival. I've never had that feeling, of actually being able to take care of myself without someone holding me up. Not that I ever had such an intense or long relationship; I was never with anyone who actually took care of me, but there was always that feeling that I'd die without them, that I would wither and fade inside and never be whole again. She's helped me feel self-sufficient emotionally, even though I've dependant on her financially for some time now.  I noticed my scars again, the other day, I've been giving them a lot of thought. They're so faint now, it's hard to make them out. None of them are clearly legible anymore; there's the jist of an E, the hint of a G, nothing else really noticable. Most of them just look like lines, scratched in a long time ago. Most of them are, really. I get paranoid about them sometimes, less now that they've faded. Unless you're looking for them, they are kind of hard to see. They probably register subconsciously, and that's about it. I know where to look, what I'm looking for. Jasmine found the E on my right wrist, I don't think she could make out anything else, and she didn't ask what it had been. I like to think that I'm past all that, that I'm not going to mutilate myself anymore, but I've been wanting to so much lately. But, I don't need visible marks and I don't need people asking questions. And Jasmine would get upset. She made me promise, the last time I cut, that if I wanted to do it again that I would tell her before I did. I forget what I'd been so upset about then, I was just always upset, and I tried to hide it from her then. But, she pets me, and she could feel the cuts and she asked all about it. She told me to tell her and because I never like to talk about how I'm feeling I don't want to have to tell her, so I just don't do it. That was a long time ago, at least three years I think. And then, when we were in Connecticut, I'd left her alone and went out clubbing after we'd had an argument, and she cut herself while I was gone. I was furious when I came back, it wasn't fair for her to cut if I'm not allowed. So she agreed not to do it anymore. I haven't felt this way in so long. There are so many of my self destructive little habits that I'd abandoned so as not to upset her and I find myself wanting them again. Hurting, drugs, cheating and drinking too much. The drinking I do a little bit, not to such an excess that she's upset over it, but I will say I've been drinking too much for my own good. It's hard sometimes to resist the urge. Making myself bleed has always been a release for me. Just let the pain ooze out of the wound, it makes it better. Having a physical focus for the emotional upset.  I feel tempted a little too often to cheat, and I don't know why. I'm not particularly attracted to anyone lately. Just every now and again I get it in my head that I ought to go out and prowl. Or worse, seduce one of our dear friends. We don't have many friends that I wouldn't be willing to sleep with, if I were in the right state of mind. But I doubt that I would enjoy it, even with the two that come to mind most often when that urge comes up. All our friends are guys, pretty much, and I don't really want a guy. I think I would just feel more empty. I have no reason to want to cheat, other than to fuck things up and cause myself more unhappiness. Not a very good reason. The only real reasons would be the depression and spite. There's nothing, and I mean nothing, that Jasmine wouldn't do for my pleasure. Why do I do this to myself, day after day, sit and think thoughts to make myself unhappy? And she keeps saying things lately, jokingly accusing me of wanting to cheat, or of wanting someone else. Keeps telling me that I don't like her anymore, that I'm going to leave her. I say that I'm not cheating. I'll tell her I do so like her, or I ask why she would say that. She's been talking a little bit about what will happen after we break up, how I'll go find some prettier girl. So many little things she says, and I wonder if she's right, if I do want to leave her. I think that's where this all started, this time around. She kept saying it and I started to wonder if she was right. Is that why I am unhappy?  I used to think about leaving Jasmine for the freedom. Not the freedom to fuck around or more personal space, but the freedom to destroy myself as slowly and painfully as I liked. She's the reason I don't do drugs anymore, having laid it out for me early on that she  will not  be with someone who does drugs. At the time, it was a relatively simple choice; I agonized over it anyway. I chose her, as I didn't really feel the need for drugs anymore, she'd filled my life up and I didn't always want to ruin myself. When things got bad before, I always leaned towards wanting to use again. I wasn't ever a junkie or anything like that, a little pot here and there, pills and acid were my main thing. But she's a believer in the whole gateway business, one leads to another and it gets bigger and bigger until you're a toothless junkie giving handjobs for crack. It took a long time, a couple of years, for me to stop saying, and feeling, that I didn't do drugs because she wouldn't let me.  I think now that if I had the option, I wouldn't want to anymore. I miss the acid, sometimes, rarely I miss pills, but I don't think I want to go back to that. I never liked pot, at least not after I'd tried acid, but I smoked it fairly frequently when unhappy, just a little at a time, enough to make me feel less.  I don't think I'd do it again, but I never know what I'll do. I liked pot to start with, and I didn't really intend to branch out and try other things, but I smoked some stuff that was laced with acid, and after that I couldn't get a good high from pot unless I'd done acid pretty recently. I'd moved to acid because I didn't like the way pot felt anymore. It felt like the world was falling down on me very slowly, in waves. Or that I was gradually coming to some grand and horrible conclusion that never quite arrived. It was the most terrible, expectant feeling. The feeling on acid was just hysterically elated. Manic, insanely awake and excited. My face would hurt the day after from grinning like the Joker the whole time. No, I don't think I want drugs anymore. I just want the chaos that comes with them, the out of control feeling. The fuck up. The bad feeling, like I'm just not a good person. That's really all I'm after, confirmation of my evil. I spent so much time firmly convinced that I was a monster,  a heartless, inhuman monster without a soul , to quote my own mother, it's hard to accept that I might be anything else. I think sometimes of how simple it would be to turn what I have with Jasmine into a nightmare. A subtle transition from kink to abuse, she's just fragile enough that I don't think she'd resist. I don't want that, I guard paranoidly against that, it's a constant worry and fear. But there is that base instinct in me, that ingrained unkindness. I spent a lifetime learning to manipulate and debase people. That was a different life, one I don't live anymore. All I have left of it are fading scars. And a particularly unpleasant frown.
