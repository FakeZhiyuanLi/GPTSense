       After cleaning yesterday, we went to Bed, Bath, and Beyond, where we ended up purchasing a whopping  three hundred seventy eight dollars .&nbsp  We got some fancy sheet sets and bedspreads for our extra long twin beds.  Hermax called this morning and woke me up.&nbsp  It's kool though.&nbsp  But ya it sucks because he's going to Disneyland with his cousins tomorrow...and I'm going with his brother and roselle and my mom and our guests on Friday.&nbsp  How gay.&nbsp  We're going to the same place except at  different times .&nbsp  Oh well.  Every time I talk with Hermie on the phone, it's so  awkward .&nbsp  When we say goodbye, I want to tell him  I love him  so bad but its so hard for me.&nbsp  I tried to think of why I'm like that.&nbsp  I came to the conclusion that I am subliminally terrified of how he would react...&nbsp  It's funny because I'm so  sure  of my love for him.&nbsp  I know that I love him and that he loves me.&nbsp  And I look at other people who  claim  they're in love but it's obvious that they aren't.&nbsp  I think he has the same problem as I do.&nbsp  We want to say it but it's so hard.&nbsp  Every time we hang up, I always say to myself that next time we talk, I'm really going to say "I love you."&nbsp  And I always  chicken ut  at the last minute.&nbsp  I mean, it's not like we haven't told each other before.&nbsp  Oh well.&nbsp  I just wish I could verbally reassure him of how I feel.  Guess where I'm going tonight?&nbsp   Drew's  house for choir practice.&nbsp  Everyone knows what happened between us (the whole cussing me out thing) but he acts as if none of it ever happened.&nbsp  I don't really give a shit anymore.&nbsp  And plus, as much as he annoys us, I must admit that I  miss  having him around.&nbsp  Everyone konws that I'm NOT the kind of person to walk away from a friendship, no matter what went wrong.&nbsp  Jenny Qin reminded me that friendship is  also  about accepting one another's flaws  .            flooble said that I am

       Vacuuming . Laundry . Dusting . Bed Sheets . et cetera.&nbsp  Today is a day of  cleaning .&nbsp  That's basically all I've been doing since I woke up at nine thirty this morning.  My mom used to work with extraordinarily  prominent  women when she lived in the Philippines about sixteen years ago.&nbsp  These women have kept in touch with her over the years, even with the Pacific Ocean between them ( literally ).&nbsp  So now that these ladies have retired, and with much money at that, they have decided to come here to  America  for the first time.  Naturally, my mom and I are their primary hosts, as they do not wish to travel all the way to New York to be shown around by their very own relatives.&nbsp  They are due to arrive at LAX  tomorrow , when we will pick them up.&nbsp  Over the course of the next two  weeks , we will escort our guests to many well renowned places such as Disneyland, Catalina, and Universal Studios.  Tonight I will be attending a preliminary potluck meeting for my church's annual Children's Beach Camp.&nbsp  There, we will discuss the following events:   Vintage Car Show/Mini Carnival (beach camp fundraiser) ~  Sunday July 18, after church in the parking lot.   Actual Beach Camp ~  only 2 days...Saturday and Sunday August 7-8 at Mother's Beach.   I have yet to decide what I will be bringing as my potluck dish.&nbsp  Perhaps some  eggrolls   .
