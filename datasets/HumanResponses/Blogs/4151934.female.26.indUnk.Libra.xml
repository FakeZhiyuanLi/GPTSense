        I think blog is a much better tool for reflections than the previous EED module's. It is simple, user friendly, Uncomplicated and can be picked up within minutes. It is therefore more condusive for posting stuff.

       This is my first attempt at blogging. Isn't blogging kind of like writing a journal? A reflective journal on your journey through learning. Isn't it amazing what technology can do today! Your views are up for everyone to see. Thank God this blog is only for stuff related to work.       To be honest, if it wasn't because of technology today, I would never be doing this journal. Firstly, this blog is a pretty convenient thing to use. It doesn't take much effort to post something up. Secondly, I type A LOT faster than I can write, almost at the speed of my thoughts. If the lecturer had asked me to WRITE this out using conventional pen and paper, you would definitely not be able to see this piece of writing. BWAHAHA.... right.. ahem... so I'm not too sane in the morning. Forgive me all you morning birds... I'm a creature of the night... though with the medication I'm currently taking, I'm not a creature of anything. :P      Just to introduce myself again, this is Elizabeth Wok. Yes, my chinese name is Li Jun, unfortunately, if you were to call me by that name, I really may not respond to you. Not that I'm stuck up or anything, just that erm... haven't used that name since my first year in ACJC in chinese class.       PLEASE. if you can, do call me Elizabeth. How did I come up with the name Xylandra?       Well, this name "Xylandra" was inspired after the first X-men movie. They had X-men and X-avier. So I came up with X-ylandra. The fact is, I love plants, and I have green fingers. No, no, no, my fingers aren't green, I just have a way with plants. They thrive in my presence. :D      ok, my friends inform me that I'm the only one typing so furiously. Well, that's because actually, I'm a friendly person at heart. Now, you know so much more about me. HAPPY?       good .  signing off now.       The ramblings of Elizabeth
