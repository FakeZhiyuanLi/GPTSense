      Have you ever been really really angry and spell really with two l's just because its wrong and you are ticked off? Well I had planned last week to TP houses (with frends) of select teachers from the local high school, tonight. And everything was going swell. Untill this morning i get a call at like 8:30am (whats odd is I got up early for no aparent reason at all) anyway this guy is offering me a 1 day contract of survey work for a global shipping company. It pays Great!!! Wohoo like 17 bucks an hour, but the catch is I have to show up a 8am the following morning, which is normally like no problamo but now that i have to work in the morning my parents wont let me go to Dairy Queen so late(my cover for operation TP). You want to know another bit of nearly useless information. Since i typer the whole thing out I am no longer angry about it. But am wondering if my friends will get arrested for the first time, and I was not there because God didnt want me to get arrested. Hmm somthing to ponder. He has seemed forgiving enough so far(keeping me from entering the gates of hell and all).
