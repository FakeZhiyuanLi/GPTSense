      Beware the storyteller, to often a liar does it conspireto make the soul cold, in lies does it enfold. Let no love shine your essence is not divine, forget, forget, f..o..r..g..e..t.   I have forgotten but I'll not believe the echoing lies swarming as flys to a carcass. GET OFF ME! I am free. Yet, I have forgotten, and more lies are begotten. Dead I am yet I am not caught between what was and what will be I am not free for these things exist conceptually only. Yet are very real when I hold on to what's gone or dream of dawns to days in which I cannot play. I have forgotten today. Forgotten today? Forgotten today!   Now! I remember the glowing ember that beats and repeats, and heats, it treats me with the gift of rhythm. Remind me of the moment of movement, with out premeditation, pure inspiration, an installation of authenticity, felicity. Bring me back to my center, I enter gratefully dead to what was and what will be, now I write history! Instead of history writing me,  now my future is not just a projection of my past, now I write free at last!   steer clear of me fear for if you draw near the piercing sound of loves laughter shall echo in your ear. Go ahead and lear fear do your judgments bring you cheer. My vision remains clear, your darkness is just the back drop for my light for as I see with loves sight, there is an end to the dark nights.   These times ain't about hocus pocus or dooms day locusts it about staying focused on our feelings. To climb past glass ceilings and set minds reeling, peeling back layers of lies that left us lying with flys feeding on the wounds to our truth our life, our love.

      Aloha, translated literally means: In the presence of(Alo) the divine breath(Ha). This statement is used as hello, goodbye, and I love you. Aloha Now.

      I soften my gaze to see clearly the haze, blurring formerly dividing lines inspiring rhymes of unity. Where rigidity turns to hilarity where if we just change our viewpoint then we can anoint ourselves with new understanding, demanding different behaviors, because in this instant you've become your own savior.   So rip yourself from the web you've woven. Isn't it time you claim youself stolen, from a world that keeps holden, old thought forms passed of as norms unconsciously we conform, awoken by a storm of our own creation, a synchronized place, to taste divine grace, witness the true face, like mace it will burn, illusions it will turn causing us to learn of our connection to life. Break free from the strife.   We've gotta take time to unwind our mind and find the first knot that got us caught in this perpetual tangle. I have come at this from so many angles, callin on all the angels. I have dangled of cliffs, repaired psychic rips, busted of clips into my own ego trips. Flipped scripts until it clicked that life is a circle, no one point on it is better or worse we are all equidistant from the center, the symbolic sun where all life begun and because of which will end only to begin again.   Mental Conflicts keep sending us sailing on a turbulent ocean, perilous waves of pitching emotion, no solid shores of which to be holden. Till we return to the shore that is golden. Turning trash into treasure pain into pleasure. Remember, remember?   Only ways things stay the same is that they change. Duality is just a mind game. Awareness burns through both opposites cop to it, and realize you will that you just swallowed the conscious pill.   Soon your sittin at the souls windowsill free to chill in your Zion I. Becoming a being in the world but not of it, knowing how to love it wholly. Hack back in but being aware of the agents vibing invisible contagents, memes based in fear and illusion, schemes created to continue the confusion, elude them, and transmute them, we will uproot them, We are the ones we've been waiting for. Can you feel the sands shifting are you listening.

      Well this is just another movement of the mind, another space another time to find my inner divine. Alowing that light to shine and bear witness to the quickness with which it shapeshifts my reality. Transcending duality, the sacred fallacy we are but aren't living in.  See there are levels to what is true quite often differing from me to you. On the level of unity no opositions exist, over this truth your mind may trip, for to grasp this you must rip from the illusion that there is something that you are not. In this world so many are caught.   Identifying with the lying of the ages believe the body cages, the soul. But in truth does the soul enfold the physical. Now were getting mystical.   Knowing no boundries it confounds thee, because we identify with another lie that we are our "mind". The mind much like a mirror the less is on it the clearer, thus we draw nearer to the light of our source. Illuminating our course. The soul is the horse we are riding, but mentaly denying, and so we start crying feeling disconnected when we could be conntented to be in ease at one with all we see. All we have to do is be.   In line with the souls perspectives guided by divine directives, Illusions we will rout, collecting our clout, we will shout our love from above and below and let people know that peace never left us.

      Hello...Glad you could be here. What is that wieght your carrying on your shoulders. Don't know well, that would be the wieght of the world view you carry. Let go of what you can't control, namely everything outside yourself. What is yourself? Remember to breath this too will pass. Remember to breath this too shall come again. Another reminder from the mirror.

      Another breath I take make no mistake I know where I have faked myself out. Want to scream and shout about how I have been lost and found again. How the mind does bend from enemy to friend.   Where we tend to focus is what we'll find flowing to us. So I put my mind in the spaces where love can bloom light can zoom to cast out doom cause the two can't occupy the same place.   I give thanks to grace for the clarity to see, allowing me to be free to create consciously. Thank you love for clearing the clouds, illuminating the shroud that is so loud as to drowned out the still small voice.   The on going choice I see I remember I be.
