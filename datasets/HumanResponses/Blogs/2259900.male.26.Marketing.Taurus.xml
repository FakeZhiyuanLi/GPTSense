       urlLink MSN Search -- More Useful Everyday : MSN releases a preview version of their new search technology. They've been making large strides to compete with Google and Yahoo. I'm not sure of their algorythms or the factors that play into how they search. If anyone has any insight into this please share!

      Yahoo now offers a Search Term Suggestion Tool (STST) to help you broaden your keyword selection search. Though it offers no indication on how many people are searching under each term each month as does Overture's STST, it still gives users a way to say something in a little different way and hopefully find what they are looking for.  Here's an example of a search and at the top there's a section called "Related" that offers suggestions.   urlLink Yahoo! Search Results for dna testing    Other Search Term Suggestion Services:    urlLink Overture's Search Term Suggestion Tool : This can be adjusted to find individual country results by going to:  urlLink Overture International  and looking in their Advertiser Center.   urlLink Google AdWords Keyword Suggestions    urlLink All The Web results for dna testing    urlLink AltaVista results for dna testing    urlLink Word Tracker    Each one of these keyword suggestion tools return slightly different results and gather their information from slightly different demographics and locations. Choose the one that's appropriate for you.

       urlLink MSN Hotmail Takes on Google with 250 MB of Email Storage : Ahh yes. Rightly bellows Alex, "Oh, the power of Google!" Truly there is much at work here behind Google's announcement of it's 1GB of email storage. Yahoo jumped up screaming, "hey, Email! That's what WE do!" and extended to its account users 100 MB of space. Long gone are the times of trying to up-sell 2MB web mail users. Thank you Google

       urlLink Yahoo to test its New Homepage - PakTribune : "Yahoo has begun quietly testing a makeover of its home page, as evidenced by trial mock-ups seen by some Web users over the past few weeks when they accessed the portal."  Yahoo! is stepping up to Google's announcement of it's 1GB storage space for it's Gmail users. They've announced that they'll give 100 MBs to their Yahoo! Mail users sometime this summer.   Yahoo! also recently revamped their Messenger Service to include the popular LAUNCHcast internet Radio and a Y! Search field at the bottom of it, something that's a new innovation when it comes to Instant Messaging.  They not too long ago also added a product search on their engine, a feature that mimics Google's product search Froogle. Yahoo's toolbar has for several months now included a "WebRank" that is an obvious knockoff of Google's PageRank, however, it acts more like Alexa's toolbar ranking in that it determines the ranking by aggregating Yahoo toolbar users' browsing patterns.   With these changes and others, Yahoo and Google are begining to look more like each other and are pounding out the way we interact with the web. A little competition here is very exciting...I'm liking the improvements on both sides.  Yahoo also rolled out today a new mail interface that matches its Messenger and that allows 10MB of email transfer and 100MB of storage. Thank goodness! I have been over my limit for several months. Kind of Yahoo! not to close that account. Kind of them to increase my storage to 100MB. Thanks Yahoo!

       urlLink WebmasterWorld News and Discussion for the Independent Web Professional   I have this forum set as my homepage. Great news and discussions on things that are most important to a webmaster...or anyone doing anything online for that matter. Many times when I "Google" something I need help with I find my way to a discussion going on here at WebMasterWorld. While all of them do not directly solve my problem, many of them do and those that don't often send me to another website that does.  You can join the Supporters Forum or just broswe the open discussions. I often find that the juiciest posts that I want to read are restricted only to supporters. You're choice. I heard, not sure though, that the Supporters Forum discussions eventually trickle down into the regular discussions.  Happy posting!

      Aggregators that run on your PC are pieces of software you can download from a website and quickly and easily install.  There are literally a few dozen different aggregators but here are some of the ones we're familiar with and you can easily download and try:   urlLink SharpReader RSS Aggregator : "SharpReader is an RSS Aggregator for Windows, created by Luke Hutteman."   urlLink nntp//rss : Bridging the worlds of NNTP clients and RSS feeds, nntp//rss is an application that will enable you to use your existing favorite NNTP newsreader to read your information channels.   urlLink NewsGator  is a "news aggregator" that runs in Microsoft Outlook. It allows you to subscribe to various syndicated news feeds (such as weblogs, news sites, etc.) and have news from these sites be delivered right into your Outlook folders. There are thousands of sites which syndicate their content in RSS format, and many more being added every day. You can even read NNTP newsgroups with NewsGator.   urlLink RSS Bandit : a .NET RSS desktop feed aggregator.   urlLink Vox Lite  allows you to keep up-to-date with all your favourite sources of information that support the RSS protocol.   urlLink BottomFeeder  is a news aggregator client (RSS and Atom) written in VisualWorks Smalltalk. BottomFeeder runs on x86 Linux (also FreeBSD), PowerPC linux, Sparc Linux, Windows (98/ME/NT/2000/XP), Mac OS8/9, Mac OS X, AIX, SGI Irix, Compaq UNIX, HP-UX, and Solaris.   urlLink FeedDemon  makes RSS newsfeeds as easy to access as your email.    urlLink NewsMonster  is a news, weblog, and RSS aggregator that runs directly in your web browser. NewsMonster offers a superior web experience and outstanding integration with existing websites and weblogs that support RSS. Even sites that don't support RSS can work with NewsMonster.    urlLink Radio UserLand  is a unique and powerful web publishing and weblog tool that is used and praised by many of the world's most accomplished web authors. With advanced features such as an integrated news aggregator, Radio enables users to do far more than is possible with the hosted-only weblog products offered by others.   In general PC based aggregators have a cleaner, more elegant interface and offer more features than web based aggregators.  They also store your feeds locally so if you're traveling you have an archive of things to read.  Web based aggregators require a connection at all times.   If you purchase an aggregator make sure it can import and export OPML -- a standard for sharing the feeds to which you subscribe.  Without this you might be locked into a software package.  Yes the Feedster aggregator imports and exports opml.

       urlLink News Aggregators: All About Delivery : "Just has you have a browser for the web, there are browsers for RSS.  These browsers are called News Aggregators or 'Aggies' because what they do is aggregate, i.e. gather and present new information.     Summary to date:  RSS is a way for you to have new information sent to you automatically.  The reader has complete control and can turn off any feed at any time.  This means there is never spam.    Within an RSS feed there are multiple chunks of information called posts.    An orange XML / RSS  (  )button or a text link like 'Syndicate' lets you get a site's feed.    A News Aggregator lets you view your collection of RSS feeds."

       urlLink Its All About those Little Orange Buttons... : " Any website, weblog or even any ecommerce site can provide information to you as an RSS feed.  Even Amazon is publishing RSS feeds now, as are the New York Times, Yahoo News, Harvard, Microsoft and millions of others.     When a site has an RSS feed or feeds available you might see something like one of these:   Syndicate This Site (XML)  (RSS)    What these text labels and icons mean is 'This site has an RSS feed and here's the URL'.  And if you see one of these then you can subscribe to that site and have its content delivered to you.   Not sure if a site has an RSS  feed?  Click here to use our FeedFinder which automatically discovers RSS feeds for a site.     Sites don't always label RSS feeds consistently so sometimes you have to really look for them."

       urlLink What Is RSS ?   RSS or 'Really Simple Syndication' is an Internet standard just like HTML (i.e. the web) -- with one key difference -- delivery.  When you use the web, you're constantly browsing, searching ... seeking information.      With RSS new information -- information that you select and information you can turn off at any time --  is automatically delivered directly to you.   This information is called a Feed since it feeds direct to you.  An RSS feed is sometimes indicated by [an]orange [XML] icon...    Within an RSS feed there can be text, links pictures and more just as you find on the web.  The different 'chunks' of information within an RSS feed are called posts.   Analogy: Think of RSS as 'Tivo for the Web'."

       urlLink Yahoo! Help - : "What are your guidelines on spam?"   Again and again SEO firms attempt to "trick" the search engines into raising their clients' rankings to increase their sales. Sure there's a need for this, however Yahoo! and other search engine giants continue to change their algorythms to eliminate bogus websites from their listings.  One point that Yahoo! tries to make again and again in their guidelines is to create page for humans, not for search engines. Tricks like duplicating your website with different urls, redirecting your visitors to other places, and using extensive linking to inflate rankings are becoming more and more under attack by the search engines.  Find legitimate ways to increase rankings and sales.

       urlLink Search Engine Results VS PPC : "Too many on-line marketers are overlooking natural search engine optimisation..."  "...across the top four search engines - Google, Yahoo!, MSN and AOL, which hold over 90% of the market share - more than 60% of users chose a natural search result over a paid search advertisement as most relevant to a sample query."  This means that Internet promotion is never over until you have good search engine rankings.

       urlLink How Often Should I Submit My Site To The Search Engines? : Again, the answer seems to be now that search engines are more advanced it's not necessary to be submitting your site once a month or everytime you make changes to it. Trust in the power of the web. You'll be okay.   "So the answer to your question is, it depends. If you're talking about Google, don't submit your website at all. Just do a few link exchanges with quality sites that are already ranked well with Google and let Googlebot 'find' your site automatically.  If you're talking about Inktomi, Altavista, and some of the others, using their 'Express Submission' services can speed things up considerably, but it isn't really necessary.  And remember, once your site is indexed in the search engines, re-submitting it will simply be a waste of time and/or money."

       urlLink Submitting/Resubmitting to the Search Engines : "How often do I need to submit my site to a search engine?" Well, Jennifer Laycock from About.com does a great job of dispelling some myths that linger around from the days of less advanced search engines.  She points out that though submission is very much overrated these days simple tactics like getting listed in human-edited directories sudh as  urlLink DMOZ ,  urlLink Yahoo! ,  urlLink JoeAnt , and  urlLink GoGuides  will give engines a good place to find you when they get around to indexing your page.
