      Well, I haven't posted in a bit but that's simply because I haven't done a goddamn thing. Firstly, I'd like to say well done to the GB team in the Olympics today because they have finally started to win some medals (think we got 4 today and if an appeal goes through we will have 5!) after a poor start including Henman's first round exit to Novak. Secondly, lets wonder what is going to happen 2"MOZ" (ie.results day). I'm not expecting a disaster (touch wood) so I'm planning on going out and celebrating afterwards until I can only just remember what my results were.....hopefully, hopefully, hopefully Thirdly (sorry, this should have been the firstly but I forgot), a congrats to This Charming Man on his anniversary day, I'm just waiting for the musical treat he was thinking about making!  I should be writing more than this with 4 days stuff to use but I can't think of anything, I'm too engrossed by the genius of Mark Silverman so I'll leave you with some uplifting lyrics: of course maybe it's because you're as ugly as they come maybe cuz you're fat or maybe cuz you're dumb or maybe it's because you smell the way you do that jesus loves everyone except for you

      Well, I had my driving test on Thursday and I'm glad to say I got a whole 5 majors less than last time (unfortunately that still means I failed though). Got ANOTHER test booked for Saturday 18th September at 8:40 in the morning so hopefully the roads will be empty and it will be 3rd time lucky. Also gives me a much needed opportunity to pass before Tom! Costs 48 pounds instead of the usual 35 on a Saturday though so if I stop posting on here its probably because we can't afford our phone bills. On Thursday I got to go the David Giles' album release night at The Dry Bar, Manchester- posher than the average pub and seemed to have a revolving roof by the end of the night ;) Friday morning was most definitely the morning after the night before but I made sure I recovered in time to go to The Railway Inn in Greenfield- cosy little pub, not quite as good an atmosphere though- lack of hecklers may have been something to do with it! On the way back to James' house I was (un?)fortunate enough to meet the inspiration for  urlLink http://www.chavscum.co.uk/  I'm really tempted to buy the Von Chav t-shirt from their shop. If you prefer political satire though then you need to look at this website (an imitation of Labour's brilliant plans in case of a nuclear attack)  urlLink http://www.preparingforemergencies.co.uk  Hope you all have a good weekend but make sure you don't forgot to buy This Charming Man an anniversary card.

      Well today was another non-event as expected and I feel like I'm wasting away a bit here. Today should liven me up a bit with my driving test (stay off the roads around 2pm) followed by David Giles' album release party which I am meant to be doing backing vocals for, hopefully accompanied by Emma's backing triangle (or whatever she can get hold of). Im really thinking that tomorrows test will simply be a waste of another about 35 pounds- some divine intervention will most probably be required if I'm going to pass. I suppose "Things Can Only Get Better" compared to last time but if I believe that then that would need me to have confidence in not getting stopped half way through for dangerous driving.  Normally its times like this with nothing going on when I find something trivial to get excited about but I'm having trouble even doing that. Just had to occupy myself with watching I Spy With My Little Phi on VHS but that just compounded my boredom even more- the characters are just too unrealistic, especially Eddie Holkenwaenk who the producers seemed to make progressively out of touch with the real world as the series progressed.

      Well, today was an anti-climax with Shilley not turning up which left me stuck in the house with nothing to do. I could have bored you all with the gory details of his defeat but now I'm left having done exactly the same as every other day- I think I'm beginning to realise what Bill Murray must have felt like in Groundhog Day (without the embarassment of starring in such a shit film of course). Hopefully I will be able to escape from the confinements of my house tomorrow but the chances are that by tomorrow I'll have lost the energy and will to bother and put it off till Thursday instead.   Last thing I remember   I was running for the door   I had to find the passage back to the place I was before   Relax said the nightman   We are programed to recieve   You can check out any time you like   But you can never leave  urlLink

      Well, today has been pretty shit so I've not got much to write about but want to keep this blog going- hopefully it will get more interesting soon. All I have been doing is driving around trying to prepare for my 2nd driving test on Thursday, after getting 6 majors (yes that's SIX! majors) in my last test. Seemed alright till monsoon season came and I was left attempting to drive in 4 inches of water which isn't an easy task. The only other thing I've had to do to fill in these empty hours is arrange my racket matches against the 3rd member of Wham, Daniel Shilley, in preparation for my thrashing by Tom (despite the fact he hasn't played in 2 years).   I don't wanna talk   If it makes you feel sad   And I understand   You've come to shake my hand   I apologize   If it makes you feel bad   Seeing me so tense   No self-confidence   But you see   The winner takes it all

      Well, some people had been asking to hear some of my poems (I don't know why?!) and Simon had got Hovis thinking I was even going to recite one until I corrected him. Maybe now you can see just how shite my poems are you can understand why I wasn't going to recite them but behind my computer at least you can't see me blushing. I rang the charming man at work today- he's even more charming on the phone (no wonder Deano met up with him!). Was disgusted to find out nobody else has called him, you people obviously don't understand how hard it is to be paid for doing nothing. Must say we didn't talk for long- he did have some work to do and I needed to watch the Gunners beat Utd 3-1, helping me to win 27.50 - arrrggghhh, why hasn't the fucking pound sign worked since I put XP on my computer. Is it cos every OS sucks? Yes Tom...even Linux. Listening to Charmless Man now I think I've realised some lyrics will, be very appropriate for this blog "And yet he tries so hard to please, he's just so keen for you to listen, but no-one's listening"  Ahh well, we will see :(

      Don’t go out looking for happiness, it’s at home If you search the world for love you won’t find it, it’s inside Be content with what you have and yet strive for more Encourage your human nature but deny the jealousy It will eat you up inside until you have less than you started with  Allow yourself to laugh, anytime, not just if it’s appropriate Allow yourself to cry, but consider others, it will affect them too Encourage others to laugh, but accept they may not want to Just let them know the expression of depression is the worst form of art  When boastful, look at the sky and realise you are miniscule When invisible, look at those who love you and realise the effect you have When following a crowd, let them guide you but not tell you When alone, trust yourself and yet consider others  Forget religion, if you will waste your life on it Love religion, if it gives your life meaning You know how you feel, you don’t need others to tell you You know what you want, don’t be convinced otherwise  Finally, forget this advice, it’s YOU who makes YOUR life worth living Don’t rely on someone else It’s YOU who knows what YOU want from life Don’t let anyone stop you IT’S YOUR LIFE Have fun…

      The king and queen are overturned The pulse of the challengers quicken Their chance finally here One of the claimants to the true prize glances down His pretences false, his great hope to remain believed The faces of the onlookers remain solemn Will the hearts of some overcome the others' carefull planning? Are some digging their own grave with useless spades? Challengers are struck off one by one Unwilling to take the risk To gamble everything they have worked for all their life Some think of their families back home Deciding those are riches that cannot be won Finally, only the most ruthless challenger remains He may have won this time Claims this WILL be the last time But he'll be back again To waste his money and lose his life    Playing poker

      I used to believe in perfect lives I don't anymore  I used to believe in happy families I don't anymore  I used to believe in karma I don't anymore  I used to believe in God I don't anymore  I used to believe in everlasting love And now I believe in it more than ever Even if death isn't a beginning I know it isn't an end

      Yes- I am quite shamefully and blatantly ripping off  urlLink Tom's  website but anyway- its not my fault I have no imagination at all. No doubt this blog will soon disappear into internet oblivion once I realise it will just be me reading it but I need something to entertain me over the long summer months. You never know, I might even post some of my poems on here if you are lucky enough! A quick congrats to Simon for his great update of the Blue Coat wikipedia page which is just getting better and better although is still unfortunately missing and article on legends such as Mr Ranguala (sp?) and Mr Armishaw (pictured below, right- next to a Gillingham shirt)   He has let himself go a bit by the looks of it!
