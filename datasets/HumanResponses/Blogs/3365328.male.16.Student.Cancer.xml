      The latest and most difficult exam I've had so far is English Literature!  This exam involves 1 hour and 45 minutes of incessant writing within two questions, one about a text you have studied (in my case 'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck) and another that involves comparing four different poems in a giant essay. I think I answered the question on how Steinbeck portrays the futility of dreams well, but I ran out of time slightly on the poem question which forced my conclusion to be a sentence long. My english teacher would be proud.

      Another R.E. exam today, just as much fun as the last one. On a better note, however, I got the Franz Ferdinand album! (See what I did there? ^_^) It really is quite good. Now, listen to music or revise English Literature...Hmm...

      Yet more examinations at school, including German listening foundation tier (mostly easy) and Religious Studies: Christian Perspectives. I have never had so much intense fun in my life.

      There is a very good text-based online game I play called  urlLink The Land of Drogon . It's lots of fun, and requires no downloads. Give it a try!  I wrote a review of it here:  urlLink My Drogon Review   Give me a shout if you see me!

      Yesterday I spent the whole day painting a picture in Art. Don't really need to say any more.  Today, I turned up for Citizenship, which involved lots of essay questions but little difficulty. I also had my German speaking test, in which I got repeatedly asked about food. For the role play I said that I wanted to be a chef in the Hotel, for the questions she asked me lots about what food I likes, and in my presentation I also said lots about it. So much so, that if you listen to the tape of the test my catch phrase appears to be 'Es hat gut geschmeckt!' (It has good taste!) So, yeah. It's looking like a C.

      Today was full of two exams. The first, ICT multiple choice, was the easiest test I will probably ever get. For a start, even a chimpanzee with a pencil and a vague idea of scripture could average about 25% marks... And it was all stuff I knew already, not got taught at school.  Then I had my french speaking test. The role play was easy (You went to a football match last weekend...) and the presentation went OK, but the questions didn't go brilliantly. Either way, I averaged a B so I'm happy.  When I got home, I found nobody was in and I had no keys, so I hung around in the back garden for 2 wrist-slashingly dull hours. It was as fun as having your skin eaten off by a flock of enraged buzzards. Anyway, life goes on...

      Later that day we had to come back and take part in the 'Drama and Dance Showcase' at school. Our play had been cut down dramatically (about half) and we found ourselves in the second half of loads of drama and dance groups. The theatre was completely packed out with parents and teachers, so us actors were relegated to the balconies, complete with no chairs. Bugger.  Our play came round eventually, and we did another good performance, except for the fact that one of my group members said a line from 5 minutes ahead in the play and everyone carried on from there, effectively losing a third of our piece... But we carried on regardless and got the audience laughing lots again, so it all worked out in the end. I got some nice compliments from people claiming to have cracked up at my acting, or cheeered up after a fortnight of bad moods, etc. I feel so loved.

      Today I got in to school at a punctual 9.30, half an hour late due to buses and traffic. On arrival we began to rehearse more and more, and I discovered not only did I get to wear a suit jacket, but also wield a Samauri sword, wear a crown made of leaves and scream very loudly! What more could a humble drama student want?  Anyway, eventually exam time came and we put on a great performance. We got many more laughs than I had expected, which was all good. We had one mistake that was smoothed over not too badly, my northern character's comedic persona went down well, and with any luck we could be heading for A*s!  Well, you can hope...

      I do Drama at GCSE level. What fun! My final exam is tomorrow, so today was our last proper rehearsal. After much waiting around for the unlucky bunch who had their exam today to leave, we got to rehearsing our play. 'It Started With a Kiss' by John Godber is about a group of yound adults going to a college in northern England to be drama teachers. There's 6 people in th play, and I play Rich. Our bit of it lasts half an hour (in order to get a big enough part for everyone for the A*s to start flying).   We rehearsed by ourselves for a while, then eventually the teacher who said she'd help us turned up and we performed it all the way through, props and all. We got plenty of laughs (my brilliant comic acting contributed to this :D) and it all seemed to go well... We'll see when tomorrow comes!

      Today was Book Handing In Day at school. I turned up hoping to have a nice chat with my friends and say goodbye for now, as I won't see them until mid-August at the earliest. When I got there, I handed in all my books and got all the subjects ticked off until Maths, in which my teacher claimed he didn't have my book. So off home I went (No mean feat in itself - I live about 40 minutes away) just to find that I didn't have the textbook at all. I grabbed some cash to pay off/bribe somebody with and went back to school, bumping into Vicky on the way, who sympathised with me and said that all the teachers had left to do something else. When I got there I told the receptionist that I might have had the textbook in my locker before the lock on it got changed, so she summoned a random caretaker guy who took my name and made some dodgy comments about not paying for the lockers and told me to go home.   And so it stands, I can't officially sign off until they find what happened to my textbook or they demand money for something which they probably stole back themselves anyway. I can't wait for college.

      My parents went to see Nelly Furtado in concert yesterday, and decided to take me and my sister along too. After waiting outside for the doors to open, accompanied by cockney touters selling tickets to clueless foreigners, we went in and after a while the concert began. I say the concert began, but really I mean the first support act came on. Honeymoon weren't too bad (I remembered their name so if they suddenly become famous I can claim to have been a fan from the beginning.) The second lot were crap. I don't care how famous they get, they couldn't sing and they had to resort to stealing other people's songs to get any attention.  Then eventually Nelly came on and did lots of energetic songs and dancing and things. She also induced some of the younger fans to be inorexably drawn towards the stage with their hands on the air, probably high on more than just adrenaline. Later she also demonstrated her mastery of many languages (human and otherwise) by singing a whole song in Portugese, as well as making random noises to the audience and getting them to copy her. Overall it was a quite enjoyable concert, even if my legs were knackered after having to stand for ages to see over people's heads. :)

      It's my birthday today! I'm now 16! I'm now legally allowed to lots of things, like buy cigarettes, and...  ...lottery tickets! ;) Most people gave me money, which is no bad thing I suppose. I'm also getting lots of clothes from my Dad (have to look super-stylish for college) and a personal organising thing from my Mum (for when I forget to go to college and my efforts in style are rendered pointless). Went out to Pizza Hut for some food, I'll probably organise some bowling action for next week with my friends. Go 16!

      One of my favourite games of all time (and also voted Best. Game. Ever. on GameFAQs), Final Fantasy VII, is getting a sequel done by Square. As a film. This is no bad thing as FFVII the game had enough story to fill a whole novel, and since the sequel is a film, it will be all done in pretty CGI graphics.  The flashy looking trailer, among other information, can be found here:  urlLink  www.adventchildren.net   There is also a forum suitable for obsessive fanboys/girls, so everyone is happy. But will the film have summons? ^_^

      At my school, at the end of every Year 11, the year has a Prom. Everyone turns up in smart dress and just hangs out. My year was no exception.  Having aquired my stylish suit only the day before, I was dropped off to find most people already there. Many people had come in big flashy limos that all looked the same and so they were already in an ecstatic mood. When I got there, I found I fitted right in as everyone was wearing suits and dresses, with the exception of a couple of 70s pimp outfits. So we all met up and chatted, before eventually filing in. The main area was generally dimly lit with a dance floor in the middle and chairs round the sides, but the DJ made sure it was well-illuminated with crazy flashing lights.  My intention was to hang around by the side of the dance floor chatting to everyone, but after a few songs and watching loads of other people do the same thing, my plan collapsed entirely and I started dancing for quite a while. In fact, I can't even remember how many people I danced with...I at least remember these though: I danced with Lauren (pictured  urlLink  here  on the right), who could inject a huge amount of energy into even a funeral, Lucie (also  urlLink pictured  far right), after Richard (again, picture urlLink  here  ) executed his sneaky plan of breaking up a whole group of girls, Jessica, who dragged me off the side for about 30 seconds, Vicky (pictured  urlLink  here  bottom left), with whom I took the piss out of every black american artist that was played (and Eminem), and who refused to let me go for about 7 songs, even when her friends started dragging her off ;) (not that I was complaining), and then Lauren and Laura at the same time...I was in demand, I tell you. ^_^  After dancing continually for ages and managing to lose my jacket in the process, I finally ran out of energy and had to sit down for the last half-hour feeling very strange. I started chatting to people again, and by the last song Lauren had got me singing a duet of 'Angels' with her, so my time wasn't comletely wasted. Then, everyone began to leave, I found my jacket on the other side of the room on a chair, and I said some goodbyes to various people who hadn't disappeared too quickly. I regret not bringing my camera, as I'd have loved to get some pictures of it all, but with any luck some people who did can scan in a few for me. I also didn't get to dance with everyone as much as I'd liked to either, but that's physical limitations for you. The whole evening was immensely enjoyable nonetheless, though, and a brilliant way to end our secondary school lives.

      Digitiser was an excellent part of the Teletext service from the early 90's to about a year ago. It's excuse for existence is that it covered computer games, but it was so much more, John!  It was littered with funnies every day and was literally the first thing I looked at when I woke up. Of course, I only discovered it in it's later years, seeing as I didn't watch Teletext much at the age of 5. Alas, Digi is now gone, but it's legacy lives on!

      Yesterday was time for English Paper 1. It was OK, I did a leaflet and things for it, except that on the question worth half the marks of the paper I numbered the question wrongly. Hopefully kindly examiners will ignore my silly mistake. If not then someone should slap them. Today, however, I did German Reading at foundation level. Even then it was fairly hard and I may not even scrape a C for it. Never mind...

      Yesterday morning, at 6.30am, I saw Venus crossing the sun (or as cleverer people call it, the Venus transit across the sun). Instead of burning my retinas by looking directly at the sun, and turning into some kind of blind cripple, I used a telescope to shine an image of the sun on to a metal plate. Now that's science!  In other news, various other tests have been waving their stapled pages at me, namely Science, French Listening and Geography. Hopefully I've done well enough in each to score me some fine-looking grades. If not, never mind. Life goes on.

      I've just finished watching Battle Royale, a very insane film. It's about a class of school kids in a future Japan, where the adults fear the many children who play truant 800,000 at a time, who under a new government act, get sent to a remote island. There, they are handed random objects (some of which are weapons) and told to kill each other within 3 days down to the last person, or all of them will blow up. And to top it all off, the 'winner' of the last battle royale and a random psycho are thrown in as well. The bloody chaos that ensues involves lots of killings, accidental deaths, deceit and lots of blood!   Needless to say, you should watch this film in all it's eastern glory. Only the japanese could make this, I tell you...  And to top off why you should see it, thanks to their censors working overtime, you won't find it anywhere in the USA! Ho, ho, ho...

      The past week has been pretty uneventful, other than a bit of last-minute revision and my seeing the latest Harry Potter film (Quite good, especially compared to the other two). But the week has gone far too quickly and now I'm left with a fortnight of hard exams looming ominously over me... Ah yes, and I got a leather jacket.

      Wow, for the past week or so I've done nothing but laze around waiting for college to arrive, and sleeping in until midday...  But tomorrow, I go on holiday! Off to the south coast of England (Portland/Weymouth if you must know) to frolic in the sea, sand and clothing deficient females. This means a lack of new posts for another week or so, but we'll see how it goes. You might get lucky. :P

      My Dreamcast broke yesterday.  After a few years of use and a few hours total of travel, the console finally gave up under the stress of my newly bought games. It now fails to leave the boot screen, or even display the swirly bouncy logo thing. So, after declaring it dead, me and my friend did the only sane thing uinder the circumstances.  So, after we'd pulled it apart completely, screw for screw, with the aid of a screwdriver, and casually strewn the complex-looking parts around the room, I decided it was time to buy another one. A bit of a waste of £10, but then again, I could always sell the GD-ROM drive for £5 like I saw someone do on Ebay. :P

      I went to see Farenheit 9/11 today, and found it both enlightening and entertaining. As most people know, and the U.S. President would rather you didn't, it is a film by Michael Moore about how corrupt, wrong and generally messed up the George 'Dubya' Bush administration is.  It starts off showing how old Dubya shouldn't have won the election at all, and how his family were involved with not only running the state in which it was all down to, but also the whole vote-counting process. It then goes on to the actual Trade Centre attack, and how he carried on his publicity stunt regardless. Then it goes on to talk about Bush's reign of fear-inducing, and finally the war itself. At the risk of spoiling it (can you 'spoil' a non-fiction?) I'll leave it to you to witness some of the more humourous ways Moore illustrates his points, and the quotes from various officials that range from the disturbing to the downright comical, but if you are A) american, B) not entirely convinced George Bush is a bad president, or C) willing to pay money to see a fat american guy make congressmen run away screaming, then you have to go see this film!  Now watch me take this drive... ;)

      I've been bowling for the last two days (not continually) and I've discovered it uses a surprising amount of muscles, all of which now ache mercilessly. On top of that, I had to set up a bank account, get a library card, have a dentist appointment, walk back to the bank, then go home. I'm worn out and tomorrow my plan is to lie in bed all day and play games.  Later on I'm off to the shops to find some old Dreamcast games, after being inspired by an article on Teletext's Games Central and realising I bought a Dreamcast and have about 3 games for it. If I can, I'm getting: Crazy Taxi (arcade driving thing), Dead or Alive 2 (Tekken with, err, interactive fighting arenas.), Confidential Mission (with a lightgun at some point, it's fun shooting the TV), Ready 2 Rumble (2?)(Boxing game with big hair), Soul Calibur (Tekken with swords), Virtua Tennis (...Virtual tennis) and Metropolis Street Racer (It has London in!).   That's tomorrow's activities sorted!

      The other day, I was on the bus and it got to a stop that is usually heavily populated, and sure enough on got a couple of women. After about a minute of non-moving bus, I realised there was a problem. One of the women had given the bus driver half a 'saver' ticket, (which suggests a used ticket - the driver rips off one half, usually) which had been refused. She then got into an argument and started swearing alot at the driver, who promptly started radioing the next driver to tell him not to let on the offenders. Listening to the irate conversation, I heard one of the women say such witty retorts as: 'How old are you, ninety-twelve?'...  And they say people aren't as good at maths as they used to be...

      Today I went to the Introduction Day of the college I'm off to come September, Strode's. We got given goody bags with pens and notepads and leaflets in, then we were told to wander round different subjects hearing about them. I first went to Drama out of sheer curiosity (I don't plan on taking it, but my subjects only filled 4 of the 5 sessions we had). That is, once I found it. Not much happened there other than some talking about the course and a video clip of drama in action - in this case a play about scizophrenia. Then I headed off to Physics, in which the teacher there lectured everyone about potential energy after the compulsory briefing of the parts of the subject. I also met Aaron there, and later Prital, friends that I haven't seen since primary school, which was interesting and rather a nice surprise.  Maths was next, and I had a teacher that viewed GCSE Maths as child's play and even A level Maths with Statistics as 'bottling it'. Then onto Computing for a boring yet informative lecture, and finally English literature. That was fun, as the English teacher spent the whole time showing us how minor punctuation in the language can strongly affect your interpretation of it. Examples being headlines of american newspapers (see if you can spot both the intended and possible meanings):   IRAQI HEAD SEEKS ARMS  PROSTITUES APPEAL TO POPE  TEACHERS STRIKE IDLE KIDS  Ah, the misunderstandings solved by the humble comma. :)  All in all a useful and fun morning out, can't wait to go now!

      I am officially on holiday now, on the sunny south coast of England! I've been mainly hitting the beach (not literally) every day, and getting irritating amounts of sand and salt all over me. But I'm not bothered, I get to waste away the days floating on the sea on a rubber ring! Not to mention the endless bikini-clad ladies on the beach...  On a side note, if you don't own the Kings of Leon album Youth and Young Manhood, then go steal it from your local library or something. It's the best!
