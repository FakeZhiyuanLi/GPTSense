       So we are now settled in Hampshire and Jim has got a fab new job that is paying twice what he was on in London and with no rent to pay! yay! Hopefully our worldwide travels will be not too far away.   Jims parents are off to Rome tomorrow on the trip we all booked for their 25th anniversary and it is getting me excited about our own trip to Rome.  I haven't got a job down here yet and actually I am not looking. I am feeling so unwell a lot of the time that I just don't think I could hold down a job and so it seems silly.  Well that is it for now. A local wildlife photographer is coming over to show us some of his slides. He leads Jims dream life - he is off to Ethiopia, Namibia and the Himalayas this year alone and his pictures are out of this world. I only wish I could offer Jim that life but we have to live in the real world!  Speak soon......

       I got offered a job last night and decided to turn it down for several reasons, the main one being that the reason we are getting out of London is to be out of the rat race, and not be so stressed anymore. The job was about an hour away from where we'd be staying and the money wasn't good enough to mean that making that effort would be worth it. This job is only a stop-gap until we go travelling, and will give us more money so we can travel for longer, but I don't want to take the first job that comes along if I don't think its completely right. Anyway, after telling tea MD that I didn't want the job, he slammed the phone down on me, which was nice. Certainly made me sure that I'd made the right decision!  So it got us thinking about our options and what the best thing to do is. We have to keep in mind that this travelling is something we really want to do, but we have to make sure that we give our highest priority in this life (having children) all the chance we can. We have to keep that in the forefront of our minds for any decision we take.  So to the choices...  1.  Go travelling now       Pros:               We get to go travelling earlier         No looking for a job until we get back         We get back earlier so we can have kids earlier             Cons:               We can't go travelling for long         We'd have to go back to work much earlier than we wanted         Not much return for all the effort we have made        2.  Go on holiday now and find a job until December when we get back       Pros:               We get to have a relaxing holiday now         Can work for six solid months after we get back         Doesn't waste time looking fror two jobs             Cons:               Eats into our savings - 2 weeks holiday is going to be about at least a month of travelling         Have to move Italy trip until December - weather not as good        3.  Find work now and go to Italy in September, and then travelling in the new year       Pros:               No changes to plans         Go to Italy when weather is nice         Have budgeted for this             Cons:               Have to find work now with no break from the stressful work we're trying to leave         Have to find work twice - wastes potential earning time        Now I've written those down, we can discuss them a bit better I think.

       So I was wrong about the Scilly Isles - the biggest island has loads of cars, loads of shops and loads of pubs. Not what I though at all... Still, there's cars only on St Mary's - others just have tractors!!! Doesn't put me off though - means that there's always a fallback if we get bored or something like that. Just pop over to St Mary's on a boat and back in civilisation!

       Hello, Jimmi is making me write on this website as a log of our next year which (we hope) will be a most eventful one! We only have 8 days of work left now as we have Easter in between and I can't wait.  We have so much to do before we move - all our stuff needs to be packed by next weekend and we have hardly started. I am panicking as it is going to be hard work - even more so if we don't have everything packed in boxes - grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Anyway, I am sure things will come together.....  I can't think of anything much to write now as it is just boring London. I am going to try to go for a last swim in our pool tomorrow as I suspect it may be several years before we get to live somewhere with that facility! If ever!!

       We think that after that we might go and work on the Scilly Isles for a bit doing some "normal" job in a hotel, or gardening, or something like that. They have quite a lot of jobs going in the summer months which we'd do so we could live there for a bit. Its more about experiencing what its like, the kind of life we think we want - the simple life really! I can't imagine what its like down there, with cars only on one of the islands I think and one pub and one shop on the biggest island! Rachel says it pretty amazing down there though, and looking at the photos, I would have to agree. Looks absolutely beautiful, everyone knows each other and it just looks so peaceful. We'll see how things go - as always, plans change so much all the time.

       Talked about our travelling again earlier - I keep getting worried about it not happening. I just get disappointed if I set my heart on something, and it doesn't happen, especially after so long thinking about it. Got Rachel to talk about the worst case so I could think what we'd do - always need to be prepared for the worst don't you?  Anyway, all turns out okay. Even if we don't get a job before we go for our month in Italy that makes enough money to actually save after all the bills we still have to pay, we will have enough to go for about three months or so round south-east Asia. That's really cheered me up I can tell you.

       After a rush of blood to the head we have quit our jobs and decided to move in with Rachel's parents. My parents are coming up next weekend to move all our stuff down to theirs, but leaving the stuff at Rachel's we're really going to need, like our TV, etc. The weekend after we finally leave London for good - not great timing as the day we want to leave is the day of the London marathon, meaning all the roads around us are going to be closed.  I can't tell you how much we're looking forward to it. Been in London for 7 years now, and that is just way too long for me. Had some brilliant times up here though, but won't miss it one little bit. Its going to be strange living with people again after our time in our own little flat - but all the benefits of living there rent free are going to soften the blow a bit! Being able to go for walks in the country, having no stress jobs, and most of all being able to see our family much, much more often is just what we have wanted for a long time.  Still doesn't mean I like packing though!!!

       They recommend the  urlLink Great Escapade  ticket. This gives you unlimited stopovers and transfers up to a maximum mileage of 29,000 miles, including one Pacific transfer and one Atlantic transfer. And its travelling with good airlines - Virgin, New Zealand Air and Singapore Airlines. So we reworked our route slightly to allow for this, and it made it even more amazing!!!! Here goes:     London  &darr;  Hong Kong  &darr; overland   Singapore  &darr;  Bandar Seri Begawan  &darr;  Singapore  &darr;  Perth  &darr; overland   Sydney  &darr;  Queenstown  &darr; overland   Auckland  &darr;  Fiji  &darr;  Raratonga  &darr;  Tahiti  &darr;  Los Angeles  &darr; overland   San Francisco  &darr;  London

       Well, potentially anyway... These things take some time to actually decide, but we have worked out our preferred route we think!  This is it:     London  &darr;  Hong Kong  &darr;  surface  &darr;  Bali  &darr;  Cairns  &darr;  surface  &darr;  Sydney  &darr;  Wellington  &darr;  surface  &darr;  Auckland  &darr;  Los Angeles  &darr;  surface  &darr;  San Francisco  &darr;  London

       we are having a bit of a problem in that we don't know how long to stay in each of the places - I mean, how can you possible know how long you want to have to sight see, live a bit and travel from one airport to the next? That is why we were originally planning on flying as little as possible. We have to pre book all the flights on our round the world air ticket. We have vaguely decided on 4.5 months in south east asia, 3 months in australia, 2 months in n.z, 6 weeks in norfolk island, fiji, rarotonga and tahiti and a month in usa - dunno - any ideas????

       I spoke to a lady at Virgin Atlantic who has given us a final price on the tickets of about Â£996 inclucing all taxes each. They would only book us the first flight out to Hong Kong and then we would confirm all the other dates later (ie max of 11 months before we fly) so hopefully beofre we go we can confirm most of the others but at least we can get our 1st flight confirmed.  We have also now definitely decided to do the intrepid Essence of China northbound trip and as soon as we have booked our flights we will be booking the trip yay
