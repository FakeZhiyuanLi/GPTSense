      Her hair glistened in the rain like nose hair after a sneeze.  His thoughts tumbled in his head, making and breaking like underpants in a dryer without Cling Free.  She had a deep throaty, genuine laugh like that sound a dog makes before it throws up.  His lawn was a light green like goose poop.  The water pouring off the waterfall shimmered like a new born naked mole rat.  Mhe model had a pouty look on her face, like she was constipated.  Her hair was light brown brown like diarrhea.  His grandma's stew had small chunks in it like vomit.  The ballerina rose en pointe and extended one slender leg like a dog at a fire hydrant.  It hurt the way the way your tongue hurts after you accidently staple it to the wall.  The bikini model had a thin layer of water on her that shined like a greasy-foreheaded teenager.  He was deeply in love. When she spoke he thought he heard bells as if she were a garbage truck backing  up.  His new car was white like puss.  Her golden wedding ring glimmered like urine in the sun.  Hope you liked them, Will :-)

      ok bq 3, as you know will come out hopefully the fall of this year. i'm so excited! book of quotes 4 will not have little girl at the store. i'm very sad. the reason is that we won't be seeing her anymore. i am moving up a choir. it was fun quoting her tho. her very first quote was " eww! don't buy that. it just screams UGLY!" good times, good times. yours truly, slooky McGriffin
