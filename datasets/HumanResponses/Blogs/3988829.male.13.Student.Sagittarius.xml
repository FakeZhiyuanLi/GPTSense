      It was Friday afternoon, after school. I was at Whitcoulls (a bookstore), flicking through a copy of ' Shoot Monthly' , my favourite football magazine. I went straight to the last few pages where the Letters to the Editor were published. I was nervous. I scanned through all the letters until I found... MY NAME! Yes! My e-mail had been published! I blinked, rubbed my eyes and pinched myself. Was this really happening? Did the editors of Britain's&nbsp;best football&nbsp;magazine really think my email was good enough to be published along with a few other outstanding letters and emails? Without a second thought I went straight to the counter and bought it. Let me explain it a bit, just in case you're a bit confused. A few months ago (June, actually), I sent an email to  Shoot Monthly  because every month, they chose a 'star letter' (the most outstanding, creative or emphatic letter sent that month) and the writer of that letter received a cool football. So when I sent the email my real intention was to win the ball, but who cares as long as it's published? This was surreal. It felt like lifting the World Cup. Well, not really, but it was still pretty cool. To read my letter, get the August 2004 issue of  Shoot Monthly.  My letter is on the&nbsp;second to last page, and the subject is 'CLAUDIO WAS GOOD'.

      Ah...it's the day I dreaded. After such a&nbsp;illustrious start to the season, winning all of our first five games, our unbeaten record ground to a halt when we were beaten 3-2 by Green Bay High today.  Maybe I underestimated them or something. Two different referees were meant to control the game; the&nbsp;coach of the home team manages the first half and the away coach manages the second. But our coach&nbsp;was injured&nbsp;so the home referee had to referee both halves.  It was terrible from the start. After only about 10 minutes of playing a&nbsp;Green Bay striker latched onto&nbsp;a well-played pass and&nbsp;thundered the ball into the net. I was sooo so so close to reaching it; it virtually brushed my fingertips as it whizzed into the net.  About three minutes later they&nbsp;scored again, this time from a corner. One of their strikers was clinging onto me like a barnacle so it really bugged me. As the corner came&nbsp;near me, I pushed it outwards with my hand but an opponent rushed in to score and make it 2-0 to Green Bay at half-time.  By now I was desperate. I have never felt like this before because we have never experienced losing or drawing; only winning. I remembered that legendary goalkeeper David Seaman lost his first Junior School League game 26-0 (it's true!), and this spurred me on somehow. I also remembered those games where one team is leading 3-0 at half-time,then the other team comes from behind to win 4-3 (like the FA Cup one between Manchester City and Tottenham). This encouraged me also. There was a growing hope inside me that made me realise that it really was possible to come back and equalize, maybe even win. But sadly, it was not to be.  In the second half, we scored to reduce the deficit to 2-1, I was practically leaping with joy. But then, Green Bay scored again, a goal that most spectators thought was offside. Some Green Bay guy kicked the ball up and another Green&nbsp;Bay player raced up (this was the point where he was supposedly offside) and vollied it way out of my reach, into the goal. My team mates were screaming 'offside'. The referee wasn't even listening. The score was 3-1 to Green Bay, and now the dreadful realization creapt over me. There was no way of equalizing now.  However, we scored again to make it 3-2, but by now both teams were exhausted and there were no more goal scored. Green Bay were celebrating a sensational win; we were licking our wounds and hoping to bounce back.  This loss was quite a stinging blow to all of us as we have never lost before. But&nbsp;all we have to blame are ourselves, because I think we got a bit big-headed after our winning spree. Hopefully we can refresh ourselves and win our next match!&nbsp;

      So finally the holidays are over. No more sleeping until 8am, no more unlimited computer games, no more freedom. It's time to pack our [school]bags, rub our eyes and return to the 7-hours-of-torture-a-day routine. But not everything is gloomy, because there's the prospect of soccer at school! Our team (AGS-13B2) played some fantatstic games last term, winning ALL of our five games. Our best ones were the 7-1 thrashing of Kings College and the sweet 3-1 victory over rivals AGS-13B1. So due to our fantastic record, we have been promoted to the B1 Championship League. Yaaay! It really would be something if we won the championship. I reckon we have a very good team, skilled players in each position and the right team spirit. These factors we will take into account during the season.  Our next game is away to GreenBay High, t will be great to see how that trns out.  P.S. I'm the 'keeper

       'Arsenal are unbeaten champions 2003/04!' If you haven't heard that headline before you must have been living in a bomb shelter for a few years or something. Arsenal, oh Arsenal - who dares to cross their path? Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham... you were all demolished and left struggling in Arsenal's wake (ha!). BUT... even though I support the Gunners and consider them the best team in the whole world,&nbsp;I strongly believe they will not be able to go through next season unbeaten. Yes, I'm serious. All good things come to and end, no? Seeing the rise of Chelsea and Man U's hunger for revenge, it looks like they'll have a bone to pick with Arsenal next season. It is time for Arsenal to stop concentrating on the domesti league and... WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE! Yes! They must step out of England (literally and figuratively) and win that bloody Champions League. It makes me sick when I look at pictures of Manchester United after winning the Champions League in 1999... the happy faces of Peter Schmeichel, David Beckham et al. So Arsenal - go out there and show them Europeans what you're made of!
