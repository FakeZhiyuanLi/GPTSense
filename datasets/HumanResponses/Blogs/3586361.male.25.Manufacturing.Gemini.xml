      I just read an interesting little tidbit. You can use melted crayon to color your soaps. That's neat, I'm going to have to try that one next time.   Also I think adding actual cucumber and avacado to the soap wasn't such a good idea. I imagine it'll make the soap go bad much quicker. I'll have to see, but in the mean time I don't think I'll be passing this batch out to anyone.   I'm going to try to use a higher percentage of olive oil in my next batch of soap, and hopefully, find some coconut oil.

      So I tried to make some soap tonight for the first time. Here's all the ingredients I used:  22 ozs. Olive Oil 11 ozs. Corn Oil 11 ozs. Vegetable Oil 22 ozs. Shortening 1 1/2 cup cucumber and avacado 25 ozs. water 8.5 ozs. lye  I stirred itfor about 30-40 minutes but it seemed a bit runny, but I'll have to wait and see what it looks like tomorrow. I hope this works out, I'm having difficulty finding recipes so I'm doing the best I can at math and making up my own.

      Ok so this whole soap thing is really working out for me. Do I detect the next career of the week? Eh, perhaps not, maybr just selling a few bars here and there on the side. But who knows? I really do enjoy it, and it's so creative -- exactly what I need to feel... "whole" I guess. Anyway. I tried some of my paprika/cinnamon/cloves combination a few weeks ago. It may have been too soon to try it because it sort of got this gooey film on top, sort of like excess oil -- it doesn't seem to be bad, I mean it hasn't burned me yet. So I've handed out a few bars hoping to get some feedback.  Meanwhile, my first experiment with coconut oil might be my best bar yet. I added sugar to the water before mixing the lye -- it turned the water a light brown color -- but it did seem to make the bars slightly translucient, which looks really nice. I'll have to try more sugar though, next time, see if I can amplify the effect. Also the green color (obtained from mixing 1/2 block of blue candle wax color and 1/2 block yellow color) is fantastic! I'll post some pictures as soon as I set myself up with Flickr. The bars came out of the mold so perfectly I couldn't believe it. This was the first time there was no excess moisture at the bottom of the bars, it seems I mixed and let cure just perfectly. Unfortunatly though I think this will be my last batch of soap for a while, since I now have more soap than I know what to do with. I guess I'll have to send more bars out to my guinea pigs....er....family.

      Found some Coconut Oil at Wal-Mart a few weeks back and I finally got the chance to try it out tonight. Here's the recipe:  18 oz. Coconut Oil 14 oz. Corn Oil 8 oz. Olive Oil 50 oz. Vegetable Oil 12.2 oz. Lye 29.7 oz. Water  I was hoping to use more Olive Oil than that, but I didn't realize I had used most of it in the last batch and I didn't feel like going to Wal-Mart to pick more up. Besides, I just wanted to see the effect of Coconut Oil -- so really just another test batch. I also added sugar to the water before adding the lye -- about a 1/4 cup -- I read somewhere that that makes a clear bar of soap. I guess I'll find out. I also used half a yellow and half a blue candle color cube in the oil to make a nice dark green color. Does the soap cure lighter or darker? I also think I'll add some Spearmint essential oil that I've had brewing up, see how those work. It seems that it's better to use dried flowers and herbs instead of fresh -- the fresh ones I tried went real bad.

      Having difficulty with the odor of my soaps,among other things :) I decided to do some research on Essential Oils. Then, discovering that they are a bit too expensive for my taste I decided to research making my own. To my delight, I found several things (mostly from occult websites that use essential oils in "rituals") about how to make your own. Basically you just take herbs or dried flowers and mix them with some oil and let them sit in a warm dark place for anywhere from several days to several months, depending on the plant material you're using and how strong you want the odor to be. I now have some Eucalyptus going, and I'm about to make some Mint. Hopefully this works, I'd hate to spend more money than I need to on this stuff.

      Well the crayon did not work. As soon as it hit the soap it solidified. But I just read  here  that you should add the crayon, candle wax color or beeswax when you melt your solid fats. Hmmm I'll try that next time. So I just used Cinnamon, Paprika and Clove to get a nice tanish brown color, looks decent. Also I think if I crush some dried peppermint leaves I can get a nice green.   I'm still having trouble with the smell though. I would have thought all the spices I used would have at least help get rid of the "fatty" smell I'm getting. But they didn't do much.

      Made a new batch of soap tonight. Recipe below:  60 oz. Olive Oil 15 oz. Soybean Oil 15 oz. Corn Oil 32.2 oz. Water 11.4 oz. Lye.   Forgot to add sugar to the water, so hopefully I'll remember next time. I'm still waiting for the batch to trace as I write this, once it does I'll add some Vitamin E and half a melted red crayon. Maybe some Paprika if the red doesn't turn out like I wanted it to.
