      lowz.  I'm actually at Tribune right now...hahaz ya you heard it right. I'm actually attending one of these crappy good-for-nothing sessions-slash-meetings. We NEVER do anything. Just sitting around doing stuff that not necessarily has to do with Tribune. Crap. Might as well not come right??? Aniwaez...*perks up* tomorrow's the last day of school!!! Then I have an angklung camp on 31st May and 1st June but since I'm going overseas, I'm only coming on the first of June. So I get the best of both worlds. Then 3 days later on the 4th June to 5th June I have a Tribune camp, at the end of which there's a Tribune Concert Nite. Thank goodness it's only among the CCA. Imagine me performing at assembly in front of Kak Fadz!!! Can die man...wait...that's a bit the duh right??? Yepz. Aside from that, I have three literature projects and one Malay project to do. FOUR PROJECTS!!! I'm still going overseas you know. I guess it basically takes up the whole of my SPLENDID June holidays. I have been overwhelmed with unrivalled joy beyond wurdz. Sheesh...and I'm still in Sec One for goodness' sake!!!!What do they take us for? Machines that never go out of power? Machines who work they metal asses off??? Honestly...and they say they're from RGS. It brings such honor to the name, doesn't it???Hm?   gtg sulk n die.  Buhz.

      arlowz...   i gtg for rd lang in ten mintues time so I better be fast. Dad says that since I'm gonna drop music, I wil drop one of my CCAs that I like. Angklung is too lovable, and Malay Society is compulsory so I'm goonna quit Tribune. Dad says that if I still don't change my attitude then, he'll pull me out of the school because he says taht I'm not living up to the reputable name of the Raffles family. Ah, the pros and cons of having a father from ri. I got in because of him but I can also go out because of him. That doesn't make any sense at all. And he expects me to be sensible. Sheesh. Look, i may appear quite carefree on this matter but it bothers me a lot. Duh. It's a matter of my expuulsion from my dream school or not. It's not even fair...it's not rg's fault. It's just me. It's not fair to me or to the school or to even him. And btw, he hasn't found out I lie to my teachers. I seem to not care that I handed in my Geog and Maths and Malay assignments late and that O'm getting just-pass grades for every single subject on earth. It's because I do the same at home. They scold me, I'm irritated becuase I don't have a chance to speak up on what I believe in, and then that maakes us both angry like hell. I just switch off whenever I get scolded. He's thrown stuff at me before and he's punched me bafore. What the hell of a difference does it make? Sheesh. My frineds all think that i just can't be bothered. Even my mum thinks that way. I tell you, my parents just aren't normal. I think i have to go now, sorry for such a short entry which wastes my time and your time. I shall call you Fran, short for Francsesca. I like that name. Ok, REALLY gtg. Signs off.   Bye and thanks for being the only one who understands me Fran aside from Maria my fave cousin in the whole wide world. I luv my blog. And Fran. And Maria. Wow, ending so long. BYE!!!

      Sigh...  I'm supposed to be at Miss June's class right now but I don't wanna go home because I still haven't found my watch yet. It's lost, see, and I didn't tell Dad that it is, I told him that it's under my table every day of the week so I won't forget it every day I come to school. He says there'll be something for me if go home without my watch. Something bad, duh. So it's simple...Id on't go home. He said that I could skip Miss Jun'es class whenver necesesary so I'm skipping lah. I thought dah banyak dah skip so cannot skip agen tapi he said juz skip after interrupting me when I tried to explain dat dah banyak dah yang I skip. Pasal ah. NOt my problem. I'm like so damn fucking pissed lorh. Btw, nobody else knows bout this blog excpet for me coz I juz created it yesterday. And also because of the censored address. *smiles*   Oh fuck they're having a teacher's meeting now, right in the three adjoining classrooms to mine. I can hear the tecaher's voice but I can't hear what they're saying. Shit man...at least I've made some kind of improvement right??? I mean my Maths assignments used to be always late arh but now at least some of them are on time...but my tests...sighs again. THey assess us on our tests, projects, performance tasks, and even Service Learning and Leadership skills. Rp what. Can die, might as well be rip. Eh, RIp. Paul. Sigh. Wonder how he's doing at school. Must be doing great. All Chinese peeps do. Malays just often fail tests. In my case, always fail tests. I mean, WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH ME???  Last term it was homework, now it's test. Next term? Next next term??? Must be crap like leadership skills aren't there lah, attitude is wrong lah...and I wanna be an SL summor. Can go to hell. Bukan SL jer dah pressure dah...jadi SL mesti ada consistent grades. Me? Consistent?! Nak mampos keh?! Dah lah tak consistent...attitude pulak salah. Alahai. Sighs again. Benci ah skolah ni...smorang bago2s adalah orang ni yang asek fail jer. Tak pernah aku pass satu pun Maths test. Yang dapat tinggi-tinggit pun tak guna...cuma homework jer. Test sebab aku tak mug...tak beljar. Pertama kali I masuk skolah ni, PSL aku cakap passal fail banyak test arh abih I heard some other people brodding about thier chem test or whateva... ader jugak yang tak mahu pergi skolah ni lagi. Eh tak pasal2 pulak aku tulis Melayu?! Aper ni??? Sigh. Dah pukul 2.00 dah. Masih kat bilik darjahn ni sendirian.   Eh...Kak Fadz ader boyfren! Dari ri lagik. Danial nama dia. Diorang slal dok sama2. Ituari CIP tu kat Ri. Eheh flirting like hell man...but Kak Fadz is taller than Dani...I thought Dani quite short??? No izzit? Twitch. Takder ada bunyik jer tadi. Seram arh. No lah jj.

      aloz  it'z my first time writing at blogspot. I used to be on diaryland but blogspot rocks more than diaryland!!! I can't say the s word coz some diarylander might come over and...do bad stuff to me. I'm paranoid,see. Ok, I'm supposed to be at Tribune now but I was half an hour late and the tyrant Ms Chia was there. She scolded me before and I swear her spit flew onto my cheek. Geez...she needs to go for anger management sessions for like forever...sheesh. Not that we'd miss her or anything. That old hag always says no to what we tribuners do. It's supposed to be the student's voice, not the freaking teacher's voice. Goddammit she wears too much makeup. Her mascara could like bury the Great Pyramid. Ok that was lame but never mind.   Oh my god... I'm like so damn tired lorz. You know last week I didn't even have one day off but i think last week was the best damn week i'm gonna have in ages. I gort a sayang in sec 2 here in rg(Kak Syazwani) and my other boy sayang Paul ;P kept calling me. He's so damn cute! Btw he's from ri. So now you know who Paul is and why I'm so damn crazy about him. I have like so much to say but to keep the suspense I shall start from the beginning. ON Sunday last week all the Malay peepz from rg and ri had this Malay Society CIP thingie. We invited some kids from Mendaki to come over to ri to have a day of fun. Btw, they're all orphans so we had to be super-super nice to them. I was a facillitator(all the sec-ones were) which means I had to look after all the kids in my group. They were from P1 to P6. THe lil ones loved me and they liked to jump on me suddnely to make me scream. Naughty fellers. Haz.   Dani said we could come the latest by 8.30 a.m. that Sunday so i did. Kak Fadz was there too and I almost wore the same pans as here. Phew. She had her shirt tucked in and so did i! Bzzt. Kak Atiqah gave my shirt and I changed. Then we gort into our groups. The first thing we did was play Wacko. Paul kept calling my name and since his name was the easiest to remember I kept saying his name too. I think I shall cut my hair soon. Suddenly. He changed into his shirt soon but he didn't get out of his ri pants. So exact orz. Then the kids came and we split them up into Sports and Aesthetics. So sad Paul was in Aesthetics but I was in Sports. It lasted two hours and then it was time to eat lunch. Finally. THe kids were all bugging me about lunch and saying that they didn't wanna play anymore. Btw, everybody kept mistaking me for one of the kids. I was really quiet lor so I guess it was like sort of true. SORT OF. Paul came back after lunch and we ate and ate and ate. Before we started eating, we had to wash our hands...according to Kak Fadz. She said cuci makan sebelum makan wifout realising and then she was paise lah when her group member I think pointed it out to her. SO i washed my hands...rite beside her coz she was supervising the sinks. Den when all the kids were gone she put her arm on my hip and then asked me if I'm tired. Yuck... this sounds censored lorz. Then she put her face close to mine and then asked me if I'm tired or not and I said yea. Duh. I was so high after that...so embarrassing...*blushes bashfully*. After lunch was prayers and then the movie screening. The kids told me they wanted to go to the toilet and they were girls but I ahd no idea where the girl toilets in ri were. So Paul went with me and showed me. He waite duntil I came out with the kids!!! Then we went back to the hall to the movie screening. After the kids were given goodie bags, we went back to the halls for a telematch between all the groups. My group got 2nd. Kuning rox aniwaea. Then the sec 4s did some persembahans. Dani knows how to breakdance! So do some other ri guys but Dani's the best. Kak Fadz likes him... I think... and maybe he likes her back coz they were always sitting next to each other. *smiles* Kak Fadz sang I think. But her voice was really soft. According to my dear friend Natalie Tai my voice sounds like Kak Fadz's. COz I'm sick mah. Supposedly. *smiles agen* Imran can't sing, he so syiok sendiri...but he didn't care so I guess it was kinda cute. Hey btw I dun like any ri guy cept for PAUL!!! The others are so kental. Poor Raphael. He's a chs guy who's in my third lang class and I used to like him until Paul came along. *makes face* Hey during the concert Paul sat just beside me! Isn't that cool now??? Yurpz. Paul rox my sox...which are so low I can't see them if I look at someone else's view. *smiles* K gtg now...5:30 liao...the softball peepz are finishing soon. Kak RosFarina is in softball...and Kak Faz too!!! Btw Dani's in art. gym according to Arina. Hey guess what there are 3 coms at home and all of them are gonna have access to the interenet. But I carn use them now coz they're [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]. *smiles* gtg...agen. Cya!

      Lowz...  Sheesh! I dunno how many times I had to retype the hello into a suitable one that I like. *Grumbles*  I just came back from a holiday in Melaka last Sunday night. It was SO boring!!! The most fun thing we did was to swim in the salty sea, where my lil bro lost his goggles haha. We were wrestling for the inflatable ball we'd brought along and everyone was watching. Sheesh...haven't they seen two siblings fight before??? Heck, don't they even know that if two siblings fight it means that they care for each other a lot??? *Mutters*   Sorry I'm being such a grump. I just feel like being a grump even though I'm not really in a bad mood or whatever...guess it's just a mood swing. Ah, the pros and cons of being a teenager. *Sigh*  Aniwaez, while I was swimming, I was being very childish and babyish. I don't knwo why. It's really embarrassing for me to talk about it right now...but I didn't seem to care what other people thought if I behaved that way then. *Shudders*   We stayed at the beach resort we always stay at when we go to Malacca: Tanjong Bidara Beach Resort. It's really not those kind of luxurious man-made ones with presidential suites and all...on the contrary, it's quite the opposite. It's all natural, and the couple that runs it has already had 4 children, I think. So they hardly have any time to maintain the resort. The result: cockroaches on top of the cupboards, in the toilets, dead lizards on the ground with blood oozing out of their bodies and ants crawling all over them. Really...if they can't man it, then they should just close down. But it's such a pity...it's been there ever since before I was born and now I'm selfish and snobby enough to say it should be closed down. Besides, that's the only way that the family can earn a living and support thier family.  But I pity them...the resort's failing. All sorts of people used to stay there...Dutch people, German people, French people. (Dad showed me the gusetbook and I noticed that his comments were the most 'chim'est of them all:P) The resort's really quite close to the sea...which means that they would keep having to put rocks on the edge of the beach to prevent the water level from rising and completely submerging it. Then the resort would lose all appeal...it's only appeal is the sea. If rocks completely cover the beach, how the heck are the people gonna get down and up them??? Pity really....it's a nice place and the people are decent enough. Dad always gives them humoungous tips. I saw him giving the manager, also the father of the family, pushing away an apparently huge sum of money in his hands back to Dad.   Yup...that was about all the fun I had...I dunno about everybody else but I don't think they had fun either. To make matters worse, the morning that we had decided to swim, it was raining. How irritatingly frustrating. We especially came out of the house at night so that we could swim early the next day. Sheesh.   By da way, I was Dad's navigator in the car. There were three cars in all belonging to my uncle and auntie respectively, including our car. Since the others were quite unfamiliar with the roads in that particular are of Malacca, Dad was chosen to lead the pack. Which meant that I was absolutely essential so that all three of the cars wouldn't get lost. But...*smiles sheepishly*...I did fall asleep at times. Who could blame me??? The roads there were very long. Of course I had to fall asleep some time right? I'm not the driver. When I fall asleep, Mum takes over. But really now. Dad says that she's not such a good navigator as I am...Ok I admit he didn't say that...it was only that whenever Mum navigates, she sometimes gets blur. Which results in heated squabbles between my parents.   Sorry if I've written too much.I still have one more thing to say. On the journey home, we stopped by this diner at the side of the road. Then there were so many cute guys there who tried to attract my attention. They said I was pretty when I walked past them. I was trying really hard not to let my butt swing as I turned my back on them. God this is embarrassing...but at least they were cute. Hee.   Sorry boys...I already have a guy. :D :P His name is Brenton and he's an ACS(I) guy. Look, my fingers ache from typing too much so I'll tell you the story...some other time. To keep the suspense. HAHA!!! INURFACE! O% relevance...anyways, I gtg.   2dals!
