      I didn't watch The Swan. However, I have a friend who was working as part of the show, so I was curious about how "ugly" the girls were when they started, and how "beautiful" they were when they finished, so I went to check out the website.   As I glanced at the before pictures, I was confused...none of the contestents were particularly ugly...in fact the majority of them, if not all, looked just fine to me! I mean, granted, the pictures weren't the most flattering, the hair was messy and no make up and around the house clothes, but overall they looked just fine!   Then I saw the makeovers...and they just made me feel so sad. They look so different! They are not even the same person! I just felt so sorry for these women...sorry that they couldn't find peace with who they were, sad that they now looked so different then how they were born. I mean, I am sure they are happier, but my goodness, I can't imagine living my life in a body that was no longetr my own. I would just feel so sad, like I wasn't good enough before, and I only am because I was surgically changed. Many of these women weren't jusr "enhanced," they were changed. And they weren't even ugly in the first place! Sigh.

      I am in such a good mood right now! We are leaving to pick up Mom and G-man from the airport in 10 minutes!   The downstairs bedroom is done, and it looks awesome!  And, I went to the dentist (which is my second worst fear, after sharks,) and guess what? No cavities!   Oh, Happy Day!

      We spent all day clenuing and shopping and getting ready to finish the guest bedroom. I am so excited! It looks so awesome already, and we aren't even close to done! I can't wait to describe it to you, but that will have to wait until tomorrow...its a suprise for Mom and G-man, since they will be the first to use it when they come to visit tomorrow!  Belle is such a begger. She begs for food, even if she doesn't like it. The other night we made popcorn, and gave her some. She didn't like it, spit it out, and then begged for more.   Today the whole time I was working in the kitchen, she sat there lookin' all pretty just beggin' for some scraps! Cute puppy!

      I just finished reading Deception Point by Dan Brown. Another intriguing read! Once you read two of his books you can figure out his recipe real quick...a strong heroine, a romantic hero, a quick paced hunt, and a villian who is least likely to figure out...Unfortunatly, perhaps because of that, I was able to figure out the villian in this particular novel.  What I really like about his books are all the little pieces of trivia and knowledge that he hides in each story. You learn alot of little things along the way that are really cool.  If you haven't read any Dan Brown, I highly reccomend them. Find the one with the topics that interest you the most...but I think you'll find that if you like his style, you'll like any of his books. He is a great story teller, and his short chapters and quick pace make his books easy to read and hard to put down. I'll list below each of his books and key polt points:   Deception Point : NASA, Politics (US Presedential race), Spy technology   Digital Fortress:  NSA (National Security Agency), code breaking technology, the debate between personal privacy and National Security.   Angels and Demons:  The Vatican and its rituals, Religion versus Science, an ancient brotherhood known as the Illuminatti whose goal it is to destroy the Catholic Church, and sculptures around Rome.   DaVinci Code:  sequal to Angels and Demons. Art (DaVinci's), Religion (and its suggested role as a political tool), The search for and history of one of the most quested thing in religious history, and of those who know what it truly is.   Happy Reading!

      I went in today and got my classroom all checked out! All of my stuff is packed up and moved into my new classroom and now I don't have to go back until August! Of course, I have tons of organizing to do when I get back! But I have a whole summer before I have to think about that!

      Hi all, Well, Its Tuesday already and I am home sweet home!  The rest of my trip was nice...I was able to see a lot of my family on Sunday...Aunts, Uncles, cousins...  Of course, seeing people is always nice, but I feel so awkward...like I never quite know what to say to people.   Family can be a funny thing...a bunch of people that you are supposed to know and care about becasue you happened to be born in the same family. Typically, if families live close together, then you know and love eachother because you are able to spend time together. But when you have family that lives far away its like, "Well, your related, so we should all get together..." Yet in a sense, many of these people are strangers to me. I have know idea how they would feel about me if they knew me day to day.   I have one cousin, though, who I have always got along with very well, and feel pretty close with. Once she and I sat down and began talking it was like we'd never been apart. She always jokes that we are long lost sisters seperated by birth. Whatever it is, its nice to have someone I can feel comfortable with.   It was also nice to see my other cousin, that I feel pretty close to as well. We drove to the reunion together. I don't know this cousin as well, but I feel like we could be friends if we spent more time together.   On Monday, I got to see my mom, brother and sister. I must say, it appears that my sister is doing really well. She looks good, she is always so confident, especailly at work, and I know she is trying hard. It was really nice that I was able to drive back to Michigan with her (4 hours in the truck...thats a lot of bonding...)My brother and I had a heart to heart...which I hope turns out to be a very positive thing!  Mom and I got to talk a lot, which I always love. I sometimes marvel at how lucky I am to have such a close relationship with my mom!   I am also glad that dad and I were able to make the trip together. It was a very special way for us to spend Father's Day!  So thats my trip...it was short but fun!

      Well, I have had quite an interesting day! Last night, dad and I arrived at our hotel (which dad strongly suggested that we book ahead of time,..I guess he was worried that all of the hotels on the side of the freeway in Ohio would be packed due to the Friday night crowds???) Anyway, our room was clean…but tiny!!! Two queen beds, each up against the wall, with like 16 inches between them….if that!!!  Anyways, we woke up and went to see my great Aunt who was in a nursing home recovering from a fall. She was so glad to see us! I swear, her mind is so incredible for her age!  We had lunch at Skyline Chili (pause a moment to reflect and give thanks) and then we headed up to my Aunt’s house. This Aunt, Aunt R, is hosting our family shindig tomorrow for Father’s day. We helped her put mulch in her garden area…a lot of work but fun, in a way! I know I am such a suburbanite… I get a kick out of these farm things;   Then we headed up to the farm (have I mentioned that I love cordless keyboards?).  Grandpa seems to be doing well. He gets h Short of breath really quick, but his mind is as sharp as ever!   The farm itself never ceases to amaze me. All of the bunnies running through the field, all of the life! Also, the farmhouse is cleaner then before now that Aunt R has been living here, which makes it more pleasant to stay. Also, we saw a deer running across the runway after we took off…which leads me to…  My uncle J took me flying! It was so neat! He let me fly the plane as well, but I had a lot of trouble maintaining speed on the turns. God, though, I really do love flying!!! Someday, perhaps, I will get my pilot’s license!  Anyway, I better head off to bed. Life here on the farm starts much earlier then I’d like!  Night all!

      Well, I arrived in Michigan this morning...got maybe one hour of sleep on the flight. I am at my moms house, dad is up visiting the Henry Ford Museum. We plan on stopping by to see my brother before dad and I head down to Ohio.   I am tired. I am going to take a shower.  Its so weird being here. I feel so at home here, it is hard to believe that this  house is on the other side of the country. I don't know if that makes sense, but its like I forget I'm in Michigan and instead it feels like I'm right down the street, like I never left, because I feel so comfortabale here.  Anyways, Safe and sound...

      Well, the last day of school has come and gone, and I am not too sad about the whole thing. This was a tough year, and I am excited to move on to something different...a new chapter, shall we say?  I have SO much to do though. My classroom is a war zone. (But remember...it has to get worse before it can get better, right?  Moving classrooms is SUCH a pain though. Sigh. I need to find away to be better about it. More organized. We'll see. Thats always my "down the road" project.  I wonder what my excuse will be when my Masters is finished?  Anyways, I am leaving tonight to go back to Ohio to visit family, so even though my classroom looks like, well, frankly, the way my bedroom use to look in high school (without the dirty underwear,) I realize that I can't do anything about it until next Tuesday.  Now, I have to pack, becasue my plane leaves in just 6 hours.  I will try to keep y'all updated via my journal here. I appreciate the comments! I thought I set the thing to accept comments from everyone but apparently you need to sign in as a name to leave comments. Hmmm...  Off to pack...

      I feel like i don't know what to do with myself. it is the second to last day of school, lunch time, and it is all almost over. Even though this was a very hard year (I can easily say my hardest teaching year yet...of course, this is only my second year teaching....but my fourth class if you count student teaching...plus all those years I aided...) Anyway, even though, it is still always hard to say good bye.   i can feel my self slipping into a sad funk...where I just feel tired and heavy and I just want to curl up and cry.  I am sad becasue the year has to end and i have to say goodbye. I am sad becasue i don't have J and BJK, my best pals ever in teaching, to share it with. I am sad because I got my report cards back from my principal and she had a "improvement suggestion," when i worked really hard on them...and besides its the end of the year comments...she didn't tell me she wanted me to put something on each report card to suggest how they could improve...I didn't know that was expected on the last trimester.   I am overwhelmed because my class is a mess and there is so much to do.  And there is the bell...

      It is 9:45, Pacific Time, on Saturday evening, and I am done with my report cards. 30 report cards, 42 grades for each card, plus comments (and do you think I could just do simple, concise comments? of course not!)   Background movies: The Parent Trap and Hercules  But I am done (ok, to be completely honest, I do have a few grades left...like 6 people didn't turn in their final science project...but that will be quick.)  Sigh. So I finished, and called my team possible teacher who is always there for me to exclaim my good news and she had the hallelujah chorus all cranked up and ready to play for me. Sigh.   You know, report cards are tough, because there is only so much you can do ahead of time.  But I must say, I am very sore. I am sorer then I can believe from my game yesterday, and now my neck and back are in agony from bending over the table all day.   And yet, I feel good....  I am going to go eat some tomato soup with goldfish pasta and veg in front of the TV.

      www.cbs.com has finally posted the teams participating in the Amazing Race 5 which begins on July 6th.  There are 11 teams total:  - 4 dating couples, 3 of whom are younger and the older couple met on the internet. (all boy/girl couples)  - 5 Family couples - A father/daughter team, 2 cousins (both girls) 2 twins (both girls), 2 brothers (both boys), and one married couple.  - 1 set of best friends, girls  - 1 male/female couple who were previously engaged.   You can read their bio's online if you are interested.   I think the most interesting couples are the ones who are dating, but not yet married, becasue you really see how they handle each other, how they handle their stress, how they handle each others stress, how they work together, solve problems, and support eachother. I bet it is a real eye opener for their future. Married couples tend to know that stuff, although maybe not to this degree, but the extreme behavior is more shrugged of as a part of the other person...I don't recall it ever coming up with married couples that, "Oh Iwonder if our marriage will survive this" while the datng couples are always like, 'I've learned a lot about him/her, I don't know if we'll stay together", or, "this has made us so much stronger." kind of talk.   Ok. I am tired. I don't think I am goign to spell check this one. Sorry y'all.  sweet dreams

      Well, Its almost over. Last year, I was a wreck at this time at the thought of saying goodbye to my class. I have mixed feelings this time around.   Anyways, we had field day today, which was a lot of fun! We had eleven different events, many of theme a series of relay races, and a few water activites. i am so glad that we did this...these kinds of activities really boost morale on a school site. Too bad we don't have more of them anymore!  In the afternoon, we had the teachers versus 6th grade soccer game. I didn't sign up because the idea of playing softball terrified me - last year at my *other* school we played kickball, which seemes a lot less... dangerous.   But, my kids strongly encouraged me to play, and it makes it a lot easier to stand out in left field praying nervously and anxiously that no ball ever comes your way, when you have 30 kids screaming your name from the sidelines.  And yes, some balls did come my way. And no, I didn't field them very well at all. the upside is nothing really went past me. I was able to stop everything so I didn't have to chase it. Let's see...one time it rolled out and I scooped it up and threw it to our short stop...when really I should have thrown it to second. Another time, it was a pop fly right to me and it hit my glove but rolled out :o(...but I recovered and threw it quickly to the short stop...albiet it a little to high...and the third time I was able to again catch it on a roll (after both the short stop and the thirdbase man missed it) and send it back to third...unfortunatly the runner was already safe.   The upside is that I had 5 at bats, and I hit the ball each time. (one time was close, though...two strikes and a foul before I hit it.) I got out at first twice, but the other three times I made it home...securing 3 of our 17 total points. The sixth graders ended up with 16...and admittidly there was a certain player on our team, playing first base, that gave up quite a few outs to the sixth graders.   It was a lot of fun, and I was quite pleased. Of course, now I am exhausted...i fell asleep on the couch at 7:30 in the process of thinking about how I really should get up.  I have the sinking suspicion that I am going to be a little sore in the morning.

Ever been to this site?  http://www.politicalcompass.org  Check it out....it has a six page quiz that determines your political views on a two dimensional coordinate grid (as opposed to the traditional, one dimensional left/right.) It takes into account economic and social factors.   How did you do?  I'll post mine in the future.  "Its the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine...."

      In order to honor Donald on this his 70th birthday, a few facts about my favorite duck in uniform:  Donald Duck made his film debut on June 9, 1934, in The Wise Little Hen. This is why this date is chosen as his birthday, although it is listed as the 13th, due to the reference in The Three Cabelleros, and March 13th in a sketch called Donald Duck's Birthday.   The Walt Disney COmpany officially recognizes only 3 birthdays: Mickey and Minnie on Nov. 18th, 1928, and Donald Duck's, June 9, 1934.  Donald's middle name is Fauntleroy.  Below is a description of Donald Duck, from: http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characterstandard/donald/donald.html   One of the most popular of the Disney cartoon characters, Donald Duck made his debut in the Silly Symphony cartoon "The Wise Little Hen" on June 9, 1934. His fiery temper endeared him to audiences, and in the 1940s he surpassed Mickey Mouse in the number of cartoons reaching the theaters. Eventually, there were 128 Donald Duck cartoons, but he also appeared in a number of others with Mickey Mouse, Goofy, and Pluto. His middle name, shown in a wartime cartoon, is Fauntleroy. The original voice of Donald was Clarence "Ducky" Nash, who was succeeded after 50 years by Disney artist Tony Anselmo. A daily Donald Duck newspaper comic strip began on February 7, 1938.     Donald Duck has a good heart and always has good intentions. Well, almost always. Actually, it's his second or third intentions that are the good ones, but by the time they surface Donald's already off and running in the wrong direction. He refuses to let anyone or anything stand in his way. It doesn't matter how much humiliation the world dishes out to him, Donald will take it and come back for more. He's a loser, not a quitter, and he'll go down fighting. This is a duck with one short fuse, and an amazing (if unintelligible) command of language, and when things don't go right, he goes ballistic. Yet after the storm is over and the tantrum is through, when faithful friends soothe his brow or his conscience finally catches up with him, even Donald can admit that there must be a better way. If only he could figure out what it is.   Hot-headed Donald is a little man in a big world that's trying to keep him down. Call it fate, or call it lack of self-control, nothing goes right for this duck: even his best intentions often go awry. Of course, by the time his best intentions surface he's probably already chasing after less noble pursuits. As stubborn as he is temperamental, he won't give in, even when he's up to his beak in trouble. Then watch out. Like a lot of people with a temper problem, he's blind to his own faults but quick to see them in others. He can't understand why life seems so much easier for pals Mickey and easy-going Goofy. It's not fair. Still, Donald will keep struggling to get what he deserves in the world. Favorite sayings: "Oh, yeah?" "Hiya, toots!" "Aw, phooey!" "Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!" "Nothin' to it!"    Happy Birthday!  And by the way, I do think his birthday is pretty east to remember: 6/9......

      Well, I found out at lunch today that I have a release day tomorrow, so aside from the daunting task of making up sub plans when at this point in the year we have absolutly nothing to do, I'm stoked because it will give me a day to work on report cards and get stuff ready for the cumes.   5 - Number of school days left 6 - Number of Work Days left 1 - number of students who conveniently wasn't at school today to present his project. 2 - days till cutie leaves for his trip 8 - Days till I fly back East with Dad to visit Gramps for Father's Day 8 - Days till I get to see my mom, gman, and lil sister and brother since we're flying into the airport near them.  16 - days till mon and gman come to see ME! 36 - days until I leave for New Jersey 9 - times that I've ridden Tower of Terror at DCA  Lates!

      Well, Belle's swelling went down. She seems much better now. She's resting next to me but she was jumping and playing before when I went to pick her up from Grandma Bea's. Still not sure of the culprit, but probably a bug bite of some kind.

      Last night at about 1:30, I wake up to my puppy thrashing around on the bed. Usually, she jumps up, takes a minute to settle, and then snores her way to dream land (cute puppy!!!!) But it took her forever. She jumps up, spins around, plops down, jumps up, tosses her head back and forth, and on and on and on....now being half asleep, I don't know quite how long it took me to realize that this was abnormal for even my playful puppy.   So I call downstairs, and my cutie comes up, and sure enough, Belle's mouth is swollen something like 5 times its normal size. She looked like she had a tennis ball in each cheek. Poor thing!!!  Allergic reaction to something, we are guessing. She is breathing fine, and of course has no trouble eating (although I don't think that there is anything that would stop Belle from eating). Last night's Benedryl took the swelling down and I just gave her one this morning. She's really tired though. She didn't even jump up on the bed to give kisses this morning.   ****Report Card Update....  All of my report card grades are done except for B and J's writing grades (becasue they still haven't turned in their reports) and the reading grades. Math, Social Studies, Science, Art, Music PE, the 14 different behavior grades, and all 11 writing, listening and speaking grades are finished! yipee!!!! I should be able to finish them today in class while they work on a writing assignment.

      You know, I am already second guessing my posts here....Maybe they're too serious (Can you believe that I've been told that I'm too serious?..... (o: )...Maybe I'm posting the wrong kind of stuff. Sigh. I've never been good at making decisions. I second guess a lot.   I think I'll skip Jamba Juice this morning. I have so much to do for report cards! They aren't due to my Principal 'till Monday, but I have to turn in my Honor Roll Certificates by Thursday. Arg. So I need to know who made honor roll. Arg.  Let's hope my kids brought in their reports (I had to send a bunch of them back home because of terms such as "political upheaval" and "Sutter was an affable man." Yeah - my fourth graders wrote that! It was fun pulling the back and saying, "You wrote this? Wow! Can you read it to me? Ok.....ok now what does affluent mean?" (I must admit it was fun seeing them squirm a bit in this case....I don't know how many times we've discussed all year to do things in their own words!!!  Well, I'm off to work now...I have more second guessing to do.

      Ok, I was going to wait a bit until I dove into the heavy stuff, but as it just so happens, my blood is boiling today by a conversation we had in the lunch room, so, guess what? I am going to vent. here. now. And you know what? I am not going to defend my position right now. I'll do that later. For now, I am just going to be totally emotional. Love me or hate me...here goes nothing.  There are these two people in the lunch room who totally antagonize each other. One is super liberal, and the other is super conservative. They constantly get in fights, however, Mr. Conservative tends to do it in good fun, although he is more staunch about his opinion, while Ms. Liberal can get overly emotional...She can dish it but she can't really take it.   Usually, their conversations are a lot of fun for me, since I love arguing stuff like that, playing devils advocate, looking at both sides, and since I am either the most liberal conservative that you'll ever meet, or the most conservative liberal (I haven't decided yet - my political skewings resemble a scatter plot with absolutely no correlation) then I most often find myself cheering on both of them (or thinking they are both completely wrong)  Normally, lots of fun.   Not today.  The topic? Abortion.   Sigh. Now, just to make it clear, I am prolife. That is my current opinion, and I must admit a very strong one. I was very passionate about it in high school and did a lot of research so that I could argue the pro-choice position, wanting to be clear that I understood both sides, and in doing that, it made my feelings towards being prolife even stronger. To this day, I feel very strongly about it. I am sure, in a later post, I will make clear all of my feelings on both sides (yes, I do have flaws in my beliefs about abortion...for example, if abortion were illegal except in cases where the mother's life was in danger, then even more babies would be born and overpopulation would increase - as if humans don't already over run the earth (see Ishmael - Daniel Quinn)....ok see there I go....) Alas, I digress...  I can already see the wheels in your head a spinnin'   Okee dokee...I'll try to relay the incident without commentary, because I have commentary for just about every line of this story, as I am sure you do to, especially if you are as passionate about this topic as I...And if not, perhaps you know the feeling regarding another topic that you are passionate about...  so I didn't hear how the conversation started, but I started paying attention when Mr. C says, "Ok, I understand that your prochoice because the women has the right to choose what happens to her body. But let's say the medical technology existed that could take the fetus and hook it up to a machine so that it could continue to grow and develop into a normal baby?"  "So?" Ms. L shoots back.  "So would you be for that?"  "No. I wouldn't. Its my choice. If I didn't want the baby then that's it. The woman should get to choose what happens."  Mr. C - "Even once its out of her body?"  Ms. L - "Look, you aren't going to change my mind about this. Its the women's choice."       So I am sitting here in shock thinking... You could be so selfish as to say that not only are you unwilling to carry a child you created through pregnancy, but for whatever reason you should have the choice to say whether it lives or dies, when there is a possibility that it could live?     So, I pipe up and say, "Too bad the baby doesn't have that choice." (urg...Should I have kept my mouth shut?)  Ms. L kinda looks at me, shocked, because I usually don't say anything at all (believe it or not, I am rather quiet at work. - yeah, stop laughing, I really am!)Then she says, "Well, yeah, because then they'd grow up in some orphanage or foster home or something like that."  And I look at her incredulously and (see what's I'm on a role its hard to keep my mouth shut...I was so angry...) I say, "Are you kidding? For a healthy newborn baby? There are waiting lists for those types of adoptions!"   She shrugs and looks the other way, and Ms. Parrot, another staff member who tends to repeat whatever is said by the last person, says, "Yeah, its my uterus. Whoo hoo," with her fist raised half heartedly in the air. Thanks for the convincing argument.   Anyways it pretty much got quiet after that, and Ms. L got up a few minutes later and left. So I spent the rest of the day half feeling bad that I opened my mouth because I really like Ms. L and don't want her to think bad of me, and half angry at what she said.   (Hmm, I bet at this point everyone who reads this is going to say, " she better not use my name on that post of hers!!!) Yeah, and don't worry. No one at my school has this address.   No wonder they say don't discuss politics...Its all fun and games until someone loses an eye...or pokes at someone's heart.  SO that's it. I am going to repost my conversation with commentary below,if you are interested. Man I sure get worked up about these things. Wink wink...   Mr. C says, "Ok, I understand that your prochoice because the women has the right to choose what happens to her body. But let's say the medical technology existed that could take the fetus and hook it up to a machine so that it could continue to grow and develop into a normal baby?"    Could you imagine if this technology existed? How many people would just do it so they didn't have to carry the baby to term? I wonder if they could make some sort of law that stated that if you were going to use this procedure as a way to opt out of abortion, then you were immediately signing away parental rights. Wow. Then people could adopt fetuses and bond with their growing child. Ok way over the top here!     "So?" Ms. L shoots back.  "So would you be for that?"  "No. I wouldn't. Its my choice. If I didn't want the baby then that's it. The woman should get to choose what happens."   Mr. C - "Even once its out of her body?"  Ms. L - "Look, you aren't going to change my mind about this. Its the women's choice."       So I am sitting here in shock thinking... You could be so selfish as to say that not only are you unwilling to carry a child you created through pregnancy, but for whatever reason you should have the choice to say whether it lives or dies, when there is a possibility that it could live?     What ever happened to making the choice and taking the responsibility of having sex seriously? If you have sex, then you know that there is a risk of pregnancy. Shouldn't you be accountable for your actions? Don't you make the choice to potentially have a child when you choose to have sex? When I say I am prolife, I am talking about in cases of consentual sex. The lines blur somewhat in the case of rape, and also when the women's life is in danger.         One more thing. If you are so close minded that you refuse to listen to others points of view and comment rationally on them with your opinion, then why have the conversation? Its funny, she's always bagging on him for being close minded.    So, I pipe up and say, "Too bad the baby doesn't have that choice." (urg...Should I have kept my mouth shut?)  Ms. L kinda looks at me, shocked, because I usually don't say anything at all (believe it or not, I am rather quiet at work.)Then she says, "Well, yeah, because then they'd grow up in some orphanage or foster home or something like that."  And I look at her incredulously and (see what's I'm on a role its hard to keep my mouth shut...I was so angry...) I say, "Are you kidding? For a healthy newborn baby? There are waiting lists for those types of adoptions!"   Ok. Enough for now. I can see the angry emails pouring in. For those who made it this far, thanks for letting me speak my mind. For those that are angry, I completely understand, its a very passionate issue, and for those that are chuckling because I am making a big deal about the issue, well, hey...We all have something that stirs our hearts, right? I hope so.

      Friends and Family who are reading this:  Please let me know if you do not mind if I use your first name in my posts. I am trying to be very careful in not using anyones name in a post unless I have your permission. (or if there is a nickname I can use...) i have closed my website from being listed on the main site (Blogger.com) so I am pretty sure the only people who will read it are people I give the address to. Eventually, people may be able to google search, but really, what would you google search for to come across my particular account? (Ok, maybe in about 6 months after I've posted alot you could search "Disney" "Donald Duck" "Survivor" "Kate Winslet" "Gwen Stefani" "Harry Potter" "Rainbows" "nerd" "books" and "Another essay on why Golf is a waste of time and should not be considered a sport" to find me, but how random is that? (o:     Just to recap, I will NOT use your name unless you say I can, but if you don't mind, it might make posting for me easier. No big deal, just let me know.   Thanks, Bj

      My dear friend and recent high school grad did relay for life again this year and asked us to help her out. We'd never done it before. Basically, the event runs from 10:00 AM Saturday to 10:00 AM Sunday. You form teams to raise money for the American Cancer Society ahead of time. During the actual event, your team participates in a Relay around a 1/4 mile track. You are supposed to have one member of your team walking around the track for the whole 24 hours. (Guess who did the 3:00 AM shift? Hint, he's usually up anyway!)  Anyways, after a trip to the doctor for me, we got to the event around 4:00 and stayed until 10:30 the next day.   I am going to post the email I sent out explaining the details.   One complaint...this event would have been REALLY awesome if we could have brought dogs...our puppy would have loved it! (Unfortunately the site did not allow pets.)    Email Thanks to everyone who supported us in our efforts this weekend for Relay for Life. It was a very successful event! Our team raised 1,750 dollars. The event’s goal was to raise $95,000. Well, as of last count, the event total was 175,000…a smashing success, I would say! And the money is still rolling in as internet activity continues and hasn’t been added to the total since Friday.      Also, our team, We Are Family, won a certificate for having walked the most laps of any youth team (Youth teams being a team with a majority of college students or younger…) Quite exemplary considering the we had only five walkers to relay at the start (from about 10:00 AM to about 4:00 PM) and a different team of five walkers (including me!) to relay from 5:00 PM to 8:00 AM the next morning  … diligently keeping our relay rings traveling around the track. (Not to mention running the snow cone machine during the day and making various trips to get ice and In N Out burgers, of course!     It was a really neat event, and there were some amazing stories of hope, strength, survival and memory. Of course, the American Cancer Society appreciates your contributions, but know that there were many, many individuals out there whose hearts were full of gratitude for the support and love you were able to give them.      You’ve made a difference.      We’ll keep you posted with any updates…     Thanks:   “We Are Family”

      Take 2. Arg. I had a whole long nice post written out...the longest yet, and somehow it disappeared...So I shall try again.  (when you read that last sentence to yourself, pronounce again as if it rhymes with rain...Sounds nice, doesn't it?)  Ok, so Friday night we went to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban on IMAX. Now just let me say that I love this book...It is my favorite of the five, and so I knew I would be critical of it. That being said, I thought they did an excellent job of adapting this story to the screen!!!!  I am going to tell you about my opinion of the movie below. There are spoilers for the movie and the book, so be warned, particularly is you don't know the story at all!   ******Spoiler Warning*******  Favorite Part:  The time turner sequence  Best effect:  The way they showed the Dementors effects, especially on Harry.  Well Done:  Michael Gambon taking over the role of Dumbledore after Richard Harris's incredible portrayal of the headmaster in the first two films. The transition was good, and Imust admit, that Gambon's portrayal seems more like how I imagined Dumbledore, a little more spritely, a little more energy.  Most cheesy:  While all of the actors are growing into their roles well, one area I believe needs a little work. Daniel did very will displaying many of the emotions required in this film, particularly anger.  However, there was one scene that was kind of off. Harry is sobbing under his invisibility cloak in Hogsmeade, and Hermione goes to comfort him. As she pulls the cloak of, his facial expression is far different from the sobs we heard moments before.   Part that was most like how I pictured it: The scene with Harry and Sirius down by the lake, surrounded by Dementors, and the figure across the lake who uses the PATRONUS curse to save them...as well as the corresponding time-turner sequence.   Part that was least how I pictured it: The physical space between Hagrid's hut and the castle...I didn't picture it quite so steep and rocky...I pictured it more as a gentle sloping grassy field. I don't remember such a striking difference from my imagination in the other two films, so I need to rewatch them to see if they show the route to Hagrid's hut in the other films.   Somewhat disappointing: They don't show the letter Harry's godfather writes giving Harry permission to go to hogsmeade...the first caring, parental thing ever done to Harry in his conscious life (of course, as we know from reading Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore does many parental acts for Harry...But he doesn't know about them yet...)  this isn't a major complaint because I feel like they did a decent job of showing his new role in HArry's life by rearranging some other sequences. But the letter part was so moving to me in the book that I wish they would have included it...Of course, they still can in Goblet of Fire briefly...For example, "I can go to Hogsmeade...my godfather signed the form."  VERY DISAPPOINTING: They don't explain who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are. They show there name on the marauders map, but they don't explain who they were. Nor do they explain why Sirius and Peter were Animagi in the first place. I think this really should have been added...It would have fit in well in the sequence where Harry says goodbye to Lupin, and added only a few moments, I think key, to the movie. Oh well.  However, I hear they did hint that Harry figured it out...Although I didn't see this part (a, shall we say, medical situation caused me to have to leave the theater immediately after the film, thus being unable to watch the credits). The credits are shown on the marauders Map, and when that part of the credits is over, the map is tapped, "mischief managed" and you hear Harry whisper "Prongs"  Gee, I guess I'll have to go back and see it again to find out...  Anywho, I guess that's it for now. I hope that I am not missing anything.   In the meantime, here is a cool website to check out: The Harry Potter Lexicon   http://www.hp-lexicon.org/index-2.html

      Well, it is official. I am moving down to first grade next year. And I won the lottery so I'll have the kindergarten classroom.   Of course, everything fluctuates when actual enrollment comes in, as I discovered last year of course.   Way more on this later, trust me.

      OK...OH MY GOD! OK...  To preface this, let me say Madonna was my original obsession. For those of you that don't know this, Madonna was my first obsession..and if you besome a loyal reader of this site, no doubt you will notice I have a few others... (hee hee). But yes, Madonna was the first. Growing up, age 7, 8, 9...I was totally enamored with this incredibly confident performer who could sing (in my range!) dance (I still can't...Unless you count Dance Dance Revolution) and write (as I always loved to do!)   Plus, she was huge! Everyone knew her! It is almost hard to imagine her, of anyone, being a normal person, because she almost always is a persona...She always has these images that she is trying to portray...Which is part of why I think I was so fascinated by her...Because I loved looking between the lines to try to figure out who she really was...  Come to think about it, that may be exactly what she was trying to do...  So on Wednesday, I got to go see Madonna perform. Could I have been more excited? We had good seats...We were in the highest section at the Pond (you know, like the 400's) but only the fifth row back...and we were all the way over by the stage on the side, just far out enough to be able to see the screens. We were probably as far out as maybe row 5 to 10 in the floor section! I mean, you could actually see her clearly and recognize her!  And what an amazing show. She sang some awesome songs...A fair mix of her new songs as well as her old ones. She knew how to get people up on their feet, and step to the beat, boy what will it be...  But the most amazing thing was just seeing her...I mean, THE Madonna, it was almost surreal. Incredible.   A night I am sure I'll never forget.  "This used to be my playground (used to be) This used to be my childhood dream This used to be the place I ran to Whenever I was in need Of a friend Why did it have to end?"  - Madonna

      SAVED! was a perfect movie for me to see as i myself am going through the whole religious debate...more on this later....  A satire about Christian teenagers in high school, I thought it was a funny, witty look at people who are reaised to believe one way, and the circumstances that make them rethink what they've always been told to believe...(all too often I am afraid some people rarely if ever think about the beliefs they have...)   In any case, I really enjoyed the film. It is very funny, and, i hope, will make a lot of people ask themselves some questions. (Of course, those that probably need to the most probably won't see the movie...I wonder if I could sneak into Harvest Crusade and play it on the jumbotron?)   I liked the whole thing, but I did think it got a bit slow at the end.   So there you go. My movie review. WOuldn't exactly be writeen up in the paper, now, would it?  Imagine  -John Lennon  Imagine there's no heaven, It's easy if you try, No hell below us, Above us only sky, Imagine all the people  living for today...   Imagine there's no countries, It isnt hard to do, Nothing to kill or die for, No religion too, Imagine all the people living life in peace...  Imagine no possesions, I wonder if you can, No need for greed or hunger, A brotherhood of man, Imagine all the people Sharing all the world...  You may say Im a dreamer, but Im not the only one, I hope some day you'll join us, And the world will live as one.

      Ok, when I first heard about this I thought that blogging (weblogging...keeping on online web log or journal) sounded really cool. I could write short little blurbs about what's on my mind and people who want to know me better could read them and amuse themselves at the insane and ever evolving processes of my mind...  I could recommend books and movies, say my piece about all of those shows that I am addicted to (you know, like those Survivor updates I always tried to do...), think aloud about al of the religious and philosophical debates that are floating around in my mind, and complain about things that bug me...Which is always fun to rant about.  And I freely admit that I am may be the biggest nerd ever...  So I found this website and decided to give it a go, and see if I can actually keep up with it. Unfortunately, I could not have picked a crazier week to begin, because unlike the series of boring, monotonous weeks that I usually pass through, this particular week had some amazing stuff going on...you know...those events that you look forward to for weeks? So how on earth do I begin when there are already major cool things I want to write about...such as the Madonna concert on Wednesday, seeing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban on Friday on IMAX, and going to RELAY for life on Saturday and Sunday? I know...Unbelievable week, no?   For the sake of easier reading, I am going to do separate, short entries for each of those awesome things I did this weekend.   SO here it is, my first entry, and I think it went rather well, don't you?

      So...after an almost two month hiatus I finally went to Disneyland yesterday. Yes. My first summer visit of 2004. My friend and I got there around 4. The rumors were true; attendence was very low. We were able to ride (more like walk on) to Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Mansion, and its a small world by 5:30. We met my cutie out in front at 6:20, after seeing the all new Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln (which is severly lacking without the two brothers and Golden Wings songs.) Then went over to DCA to see  it's tough to be a bug and, of course, Tower of Terror (I have now ridden the California version 10 times. I know. There are people out there that have ridden it way more. but still. I am keeping count.)  Sigh. My Disneyland fix. Its staring to wear off....want....to....go....back....

      Apparently, laws about beach access and organizations protecting beaches in our country rage battles all the time.   Is the beach something that can be privatly owned?  Can a beach limit its hours of use?  Is it appropriate to charge an entrance fee for shore access (not parking)?  Is using a beach a natural right for all?   These are just some resources I found today. I am sure there are much better resources out there. But I am tired.   &nbsp;  State of the Beach:   urlLink http://www.beach.com/stateofthebeach2004/home.asp    In Hawaii:  Hawaii's beaches belong to the people. All beaches (even those in front of exclusive resorts) are public property and you are welcome to visit them. Hawaii state law requires that all resorts and hotels offer public right-of-way access (across their private property) to the beach, along with public parking. So just because a beach fronts a hotel doesn't mean that you can't enjoy the water. It does mean that the hotel may restrict certain areas on private property for hotel guests' use only. Generally, hotels welcome non-guests to their facilities. They frown on non-guests using the beach chairs reserved for guests, but if a non-guest has money and wants to rent gear, buy a drink, or eat a sandwich, well, money is money and they will gladly accept it from anyone. However, that does not mean that you can willy-nilly cross private property to get to a beach. Look for BEACH ACCESS signs; don't trespass.   Florida:   urlLink http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/landuse/Vol151/spain1.htm    In California:   urlLink http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=prc&group=30001-31000&amp;file=30210-30214    In New Jersey:   urlLink http://www.gsenet.org/library/11gsn/2004/gs040712.php#BATTLE%20FOR%20BEACH%20ACCESS%20RAGES

      Ok, I know the concept of Karma, or things going full circle, or people creating their own luck is not a new concept, but man, to a feel like the gods were trying to pound that into me this trip!   Here are a few things that happened on my trip that kept these thoughts on my mind:     On the first leg of my trip, I sat down in my window seat, and the lady next to me asked if I would mind switching seats with her husband, a few rows up, so they could sit together. Of course I switched, and gathered up my things. The seat I switched into turned out to be the first row past first class, and it had about as much leg room as an&nbsp;emergency exit row!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; On the second leg of the trip, from Minneapolis to Newark, as I approached my row, I notices an older gentleman seated in my seat. He had misread his ticket and sat in the wrong window seat. So he didn't have to get up, I offered to just take his seat. As it turns out, because I switched sides, I was able to to see NYC out the window!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; On the airplane I read a Reader's Digest Article about making your own luck.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; In NYC, I came across several friendly people. In the subway, while we were looking for the appropriate platform, a nice guy came up and asked where we were going and if we needed help. Later on, in NYC, As I was getting my camera out, another man stopped and asked if we needed directions. All in all, I found people very friendly in New York. They were willing to help, and friendly, and let me tell you what a difference it made when you just smiled and said thank you! Treat people well, and they will treat you well, back!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. On the plane ride home, I met this rather unhappy young man. He was on his way back to California to visit his brother and he hated it. California was full of pretentious people who felt they were more than they are. Everyone thinks that they are somebody. He grew up in the same town I lived in. I felt really bad for this guy. It was obvious that he had a very negative stereotype about California people. Thus, whenever he met people that fit his stereotype, he filed it away. In other words, he sought out those types of people.  &nbsp;  Lesson Learned: If you believe people are genuinely good, then, for the most part, you will meet good, friendly people. That is what you will seek out.  If you treat people with kindness and respect, they will respond in kind, for the most part.   And to combine those two lessons, if you believe that people or genuinely good&nbsp;hearted, then you will treat them with kindness and respect. They will return your friendliness, and as a result, the majority of people you meet will be nice.   This seems fairly obvious, I suppose, but it was just really driven home to me this trip as I watched how people interacted with each other!  Sometimes, the effects aren't so obvious as they were on this trip for me. Sometimes you may be very friendly, and you don't get a kind response. It happens. I read in a book somewhere before I went to Washington D.C. that there were a lot of homeless people there. The book basically said it was up to you whether you gave them money or food coupons or any other hand outs, or nothing at all, but it urged you to remember that these were people too, and if you didn't want to give out anything, of course that was logical, but to still treat them with respect. A smile, or a simple, "I am sorry, I don't have anything to give you." or anything that acknowledges their presence is better than ignoring them. Everyone might not agree, but since I've adopted this philosophy I've felt much better. Maybe it doesn't make a difference, but to me it does. I smile, I make eye contact, I say no thank you to people trying to sell stuff on the street, and sometimes I get a smile back. But you know what? It doesn't seem scary anymore. It is still sad, but not scary. I don't know if it makes a difference, but it feels better that ignoring people.   "Treat others the way you wish to be treated" - The Golden Rule  The golden rule is best interpreted as saying: "Treat others only in ways that you're willing to be treated in the same exact situation." To apply it, you'd imagine yourself in the exact place of the other person on the receiving end of the action. If you act in a given way toward another, and yet are unwilling to be treated that way in the same circumstances, then you violate the rule. - Routledge  "Everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect" - Cinderella  The Universality of the Golden Rule in the World Religions   Christianity  All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye so to them; for this is the law and the prophets. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Matthew 7:1    Confucianism  Do not do to others what you would not like yourself. Then there will be no resentment against you, either in the family or in the state. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Analects 12:2    Buddhism  Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Udana-Varga 5,1  Hinduism  This is the sum of duty; do naught onto others what you would not have them do unto you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mahabharata 5,1517    Islam  No one of you is a believer until he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sunnah    Judaism  What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellowman. This is the entire Law; all the rest is commentary. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Talmud, Shabbat 3id    Taoism  Regard your neighbors gain as your gain, and your neighbors loss as your own loss.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tai Shang Kan Yin Pien    Zoroastrianism  That nature alone is good which refrains from doing another whatsoever is not good for itself. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dadisten-I-dinik, 94,5  Humanism:  "(5) Humanists acknowledge human interdependence, the need for mutual respect and the kinship of all humanity."  "(11) Humanists affirm that individual and social problems can only be resolved by means of human reason, intelligent effort, critical thinking joined with compassion and a spirit of empathy for all living beings. "    Native American Spirituality:  "Respect for all life is the foundation." The Great Law of Peace.  "All things are our relatives; what we do to everything, we do to ourselves. All is really One." Black Elk   Roman Pagan Religion: "The law imprinted on the hearts of all men is to love the members of society as themselves."  Shinto:&nbsp; "The heart of the person before you is a mirror. See there your own form"  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Hi all! I just got back from New Jersey, and I have a lot to tell you all about! I really don't even know where to begin! I had an awesome time, my friend was very welcoming, and I saw so many incredible things.   Here is a list of the things that I was able to see on my trip:    Rent, on Broadway, with an incredible cast including Matt Caplan, perhaps the best "Mark" I have ever seen, Jeremy Kushnier as Roger (whom my friend had seen previously in Footloose), Jai Rodriguez (from Queer Eye) as Angel, and Melanie Brown (of the Spice Girls) as Mimi. An incredible cast and an incredible experience. After the show, I was able to meet Jeremy and Matt, get Melanie's autograph, and snap a picture of Jai. The theater itself was small an intimate, especially from our vantage point in the orchestra section.  Times Square: In many ways, it reminded me of Vegas, with tons of people on the streets and all of the bright lights. I love big cities. The sidewalks were&nbsp;lined with artists, people from every walk of life, and the smell of the food carts made NYC feel very&nbsp;distinct.&nbsp;  My friend showed me&nbsp;Clifton, the town she grew up in, and Montclair, where she went to college.   I went into Astoria, which is in Queens, to a Greek restaurant. There are a lot of Greek stores and restaurants in Astoria, and a lot of Greeks hang out there. (So of course, my friend had to take me so I could get a glimpse of her culture...Until she can bring me to Greece that it!)  Mid and Upper Manhattan, including Rockefeller Center, Madison Square&nbsp;Gardens, radio City Music Hall, Times Square&nbsp;in the day time, and Madam Tusaud's (spell?)  Central Park, including the Central Park zoo and the Alice and Wonderland Statue. (I would love to spend more time just chillin' in Central Park!)  The Empire State building, including the observation tower.  Atlantic City, New Jersey, which was perhaps, a page out of my fantasy book. I have been obsessed with beachy/boardwalk towns since reading about them in The Babysitter's club series when I was a kid. Seeing Atlantic City's Boardwalk was just like I imagined.&nbsp;The pier with the rides and the ever so romantic water's edge Ferris wheel,&nbsp;arcades and food shops lining the boardwalk, and the sandy&nbsp;beach. Sigh. Plus. There are casinos right&nbsp;along the boardwalk!  The famous Egg Platter Diner, with its&nbsp;number of Egg novelties to choose&nbsp;from. I had an omelet with cheese and Taylor ham.  Liberty science&nbsp;Center, which is a children's science museum in Liberty state Park, New Jersey. (You can take a ferry from Liberty State Park to the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty and Ellis Island, but you have to be back by 4, where as you have until 6:30 if you leave from battery park in New York.)  Hiking at Bushkill Falls in Pennsylvania, which was very nice and tranquil, and very cool&nbsp;to see how beautiful the east coast can be away from the city.   Point PLeasent, a popular beach and boardwalk in New Jersey. Unfortunately,&nbsp;this really put a downer on my boardwalk fantasies. The boardwalk itself was cool. Lots of neat little shops, arcades (with slot machines that gave out tokens that you could collect prizes with, like tickets, that kids could play on. Also, there were adult prizes, like candles and clocks and stuff, and adults playing&nbsp;on these machines like it was a casino. Even the game ones that were not slot machines...You'd see adults playing two at a time collecting tickets. It was funny. Not adults playing games, thats totally fun, but playing all serious like, "with this last quarter I might get enough tickets to buy myself that set of non stick frying pans!" kind of serious.) But the Real downer was this: THEY CHARGED, PER PERSON, TO ENTER THE BEACH.&nbsp;There was a fence along the boardwalk, and every so often there would be a set of steps leading down to the beach and next to it a person in a booth collecting $5.50 per adult. Outrage. (oh, also odd, you weren't allowed to change your clothes. There were signs&nbsp;by the bathroom saying you weren't allowed to change your clothes in there. Odd. So lots of people spent all day in their bathing suits.&nbsp;(some&nbsp;brought coverups, some didn't.) Hmm, I wonder&nbsp;is&nbsp;if the state of&nbsp;New Jersey knows that a common cause of yeast infections is wearing warm, wet bathing suits all day. Not a pretty picture.   Lower Manhattan. We saw Battery Park, The&nbsp;Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island.&nbsp;(Let me tell you, plan on spending your whole day at Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. Seriously. There was A LOT to see at Ellis ISland!&nbsp;  Ground Zero. All rubble was cleaned up and the actual sight is prepared for building. Building 7 is already being rebuilt (not one of the&nbsp;twin towers, but the last WTC building to fall.) They built an observation fence all along the east side of the trade center and lined it with the history of the WTC as well as a memoriam to those whose lives were lost.  The New York Subway System - ah - like a dream come true. Did I mention how much I love subways???   As you can see, it was a jammed pack trip. I&nbsp;was able to get to know my East Coast friend much better and&nbsp;see so many amazing places.&nbsp;  I can't wait to go back!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      ***spoilers!!!***  So I tuned in to Amazing Race (Just FYI - Due to my being in New Jersy it is possible that I won't watch Amazing Race until I get back...so dry your eyes...my update will come...)last night after our trip to the Orange County Fair...  Coolest Destination: Buenos Aires to the grave site of Eva Peron.  Team commentary:  Brandon/Nicole - Uh, neutral...they didn't mention their love for the Lord our Savior this episode, so that weren't as annoying as the first time around.   Charla and Mirna - Silghtly less anoying. Mirna is a wuss. I still can't believe she made Charla carry the 50 pounds of meat last week!  Jim and Marsha - I am probably rooting for the father/daughter team the most. I feel so bad for how their race started and they seem to handle everything well.   Linda/Karen - pissed me off that they were so low as to play the currency exchange trick. I mean come on, I suppose its fair, but there are dirty and rude ways to play the game....  Bob and Joyce - I really like how they work as a team. They did well on the perro challenge working together.  Colin and Christie - nothing really stands out....  Marshall and Lance - same thing...  Chip and Kim - I like them okay...they seem like a good team.  Kami and Karli - I like the twins also. I feel bad that they took the taxi cab issue so seriously, becasue they had a good alliance with Chip and Kim...lets face it...everyone wants to win!!!  Alison and Donny - eliminiated!!! Yes!!! I don't think I could have watched Alison be such a bitch to Donny for the whole season. I just hope he gets smart, dumps her, and moves on!  If you want an episode synopsis, go to cbs.com and click on Amazing Race.  Next episode Tuesday, July 20th 10:00 pm

      Well, we finally got the game today, which gives me one day of playing time before I leave. It is pretty much the same game as before but with new songs. On my first attepmt of Pap Don't Preach, I got 50001 points, 100% greats. (of course, I was on easy judging)  It has more characters, as well as three new venues (but two have to be unlocked.)   The cool thing, which I haven't tried yet, is the Medley Mode, where you pick 3-5 sings and then sing clips from them in succession and get judged. I may save this for when I come back.  Also, really cool, is the short song mode...for when you have a lot of people playing, becuse you can sing any song but a shorter version.   Well, I still have to pack tonight...and sing...

      You may have to sit down to read this. This Friday, I am going to see Rent. On Broadway. In New York City. Ok, calm down, now, I know that that is already exciting enough, BUT.... there is a reason we are seeing in on Friday and not, say, next week. You see returning to the roll of Angel until July 17th is none other than Jai Rodriguez from Queer Eye. Take a deep breath and try to contain your excitement...we don't want to alarm the neighbors.   Ah...sure we do!

      So I wake up early this morning to head out to buy Karaoke Revolution, which is being released today. Grrr... Apparently, this game is not popular enough to warrant same day shipping, so guess what? Its being shipped to stores today. Which MEANS that I may not get to play Karaoke goodness until I return. Sigh.   40 minutes until I can register online for next semester.

      First, a gripe. Why are they putting the Amazing Race on so late at night???? Its a great show! One families could acually watch together!!! Grrr...   Lucky for me, I have TIVO, so if my updates are behind its because I didn't watch them yet!   If you missed the premiere...they will rebroadcast it on Saturday, July 10th, at 8:00 PM...don't read this update if you don't want to ruin it!  ***MAY contain spoilers***  So I watched the first episode of Amazing Race. I don't hate anybody yet. I really like the dad daughter team...that dad is one tough man...I felt so bad that their race had to start with an injury like it did. I am glad that it got taken care of, but I just felt so bad for him...I hate when people get hurt.  Amazingly enough, both teams that missed the detour clue made it without being eliminated. A big drawback but at least they made it. The zip line looked like so much fun!  I think as I get to know the characters better, my updates will be more interesting..then again, there isn't much strategy with predicting...its not about voting off like in survivor.   However, they do have an itnteresting twist...the whole yield thing...aparently, you can,  one time in the game, require another team to wait at the yield point for one hour. Unfortunatly, it seems like the team getting to make the choice has to be ahead, and they must choose a team that is behind...so I am not quite sure how that will work...we'll see.  I truly hope that the couple that got voted off really have gained strength in their relationship while they did this adventure together! Erika was right when she said being with a nice guy was more important.   Amazing Race next episode: Tuesday, July 13th 10:00 PM (ARG! WHY SO LATE???????)

      YES!!!! Karaoke Revolution 2 comes out next week! I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO excited! They were going to come out with an expansion pack, but chose instead to publish a new, stand alone game, which probably adds $10 to the price...but thats okay, I am so excited anyway! The 2nd game has all of the original characters (thank goodness my girl is still going to be rockin in the new game!)  Here's a list of the new songs: Baby One More Time   Born To Be Wild   Cry   Drift Away   Every Breath You Take   Friends In Low Places   Genie in a Bottle   Heartbreak Hotel   Here Without You   Hot Stuff   I Believe in a Thing Called Love   I Hate Everything About You   I Will Survive   I'll Make Love to You   I'm With You   Irresistible   It's My Life   I've Got You Under My Skin Jesse's Girl   Lady Marmalade   Let's Get It On   Miss You   My Girl   Papa Don't Preach   Perfect   Rich Girl   Rock and Roll All Night   Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay   Sweet Home Alabama   The First Cut is the Deepest   The Joker   Toxic   Virtual Insanity   We Are Family   White Flag   urlLink

      You know, it occured to me on Sunday that 4th of July is one of my favorite hoildays. You can spend the whole day outside. You can swim, barbeque, and relax. And pretty much everyone that you are going to meet is celebrating as well. You don't have to stress about wrapping any presents. There are patriotic songs to sing. Fire works. Community events. People wear red white and blue, spirited colors like a school pep rally...except that we are all on the same team. Its a pretty cool feeling.   I spent one 4th of July in London. It was odd to not have everyone celebrating...until we got down town...there was a huge celebration going on...lots of whistles blowing, happy people dancing in the street...one of the coolest gay pride festivals I've ever attended. So we still got to celebrate on 4th of July!   I was worried thhis year about Belle, and that all the loud fireworks would scare her. However, she did just fine... Probably because she was so tired from going to the HB parade and then to the barbeque that she pretty much slept through the whole evening. Plus, we did have Karaoke Revolution up pretty loud...

      Ok, for those of you who have checked out the website, none of this is news to you, but I want to give my prediction as well.  The 6th Harry Potter book is titled, "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince." JK Rowling stated on her website that this book was at one time the title for book 2, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and that there are clues in that book which are very significant to the story. She has also said that the Half-blood prince is not Harry or Voldemort.   My prediction. The Half Blood Prince is either a descendent of Slytherin or Gryffindor...most likely Slytherin, which would be interesting indeed considering Salazar Slytherin's insistence that Hogwart's be a school for only full-bloods. We shall see.   Knowing JK Rowling, I could be completely off...she does have a way of surprising me!

      So, Mom, G-man, cutie, and myself went to Vegas on Monday and returned on Friday. We stayed at the Rio, which was nice because the rooms are bigger...plenty of room for all of us!      How'd we do in the Casino?     Ok, well, we didin't play all that much, and we're not exactly high rollers, plus I was carrying around some bad karma from our stop at the outlet center...but my baby did win $60 on a nickel slot machine. That was fun. Overall, we broke about even.    How were the Casino games?   I was very dissappinted to discover that my old Monopoly machines were removed and replaced with new monopoly machines that paid off significantly less. Sigh. We're not supposed to come out ahead? On the bright side, many of the major casinos now have penny slots (granted, you can bet $1.50 or even $2 on the machines if you play like 15 lines and bet 20 per line...) but you can also just bet like 25 cents, 5 cents, even, if you want, 1 cent. I always look for the ones that have bonus games, because, well, I am a sucker for bonus games.    Other things worth mentioning at the Casino:   It seems that casinos will no longer change pennies and dimes for you. So our change jar that we fill up and usually change in Vegas is still full. That sucks big time. I don't know if this is true of all casinos, though, so if you find one that is still smart enough to change pennies and dimes, please let me know.    Let's talk food. Best Buffet?   Still, hands down, Carnival World Buffet. Believe is or not, they have made it even better since I was last there. Yes, they have. For those of you that don't know the glory and awe of this feasting wonder, let me explain. The Carnival World Buffet is located at the Rio hotel, which is west of the strip, just past the 15, on Flamingo Drive. The Carnival World Buffet always has a line, which gives you thirty minutes to continue to work up your appetite. Once inside and seated, you may be a little disoriented, and not quite know where to begin. This is because there are about 10 different buffet stations within this one buffet. It is best to walk the entire lengteh of the buffet, as to take in all of your options, as well as speed up your metabolism with this brief hike so as to burn calories faster and consequently, be able to eat more. There is a salad bar, A pizza bar, A seafood bar, a fish and chips bar, a sushi bar, an Asian bar (including teppen yaki and Pho,) A Chinese bar, A mexican bar, an Italian bar, a Barbeque Stop, And a classic American buffet bar (with, you know, the whole turkey-mashed potatoes-macaroni and cheese-stuff,) and of course, the dessert bar. And to be honest, I am probably missing some things too. And as if my day couldn't get any better, they had crab legs. Sigh.   urlLink     Best Buffet Deal   Texas Station. Off the strip, North west of downtown, is our favorite of the Station Hotels, Texas Station. This hotel/casino has a movie theeater, bowling alley, and kids club, great slots, an excellent food court (Fatburger, Baja Fresh...) and also a really cool buffet. Like a mini Rio, this buffet has about 6 stations serving a variety of foods, including mexican, pizza, chinese, american...and these really yummy desert bars that are cookie based topped with chocolate and butterscotch chips, nuts, and cocnut. yummers. Best part? Dinner is only $7.95. Now I ask you, where can you get your drink meal and dessert for that price this day and age? (Not to mention soup, salad, and as many entrees and desserts as you want???)   urlLink     Coolest Attraction Experienced This Trip:   Star Trek Experience at the Hilton in Las Vegas. This attraction is so cool. Well worth doing at least once. I am not even the biggest star trek fan, and I LOVE this attraction. I have done it twice now. I can't explain more, because it is something that you have to DO. If anyone told you about it, they would be selfish and destructive as the key to the attraction is not knowing what is going to happen. Sigh. Such an amazing thing. FYI, I am referring to the original attraction, which is now called the Klingon Encounter. We also did the new one, the Borg Assimilation, which was great as well, but not nearly as awesome as the original. By the way, when you purchase your ticket it inculdes both attractions. Hint: We found out that if you go to the Ticket's Tonight booth above GameWorks (between the Giant Coke bottle and the M &amp; M factory next to MGM grand, you can get half off tickets for the Star Trek Experience (which we didn't expect since it isn't a show...) Again, I highly reccomend...even if you are not a fan of the shows!!!!    urlLink     Dam   Yup, we saw Hoover Dam. I am always amazed by this whenever I see it. It is truly a cool thing in many ways. OF course, the whole time I was there I had Ishmael speaking in my ear..."Man trying to harness nature....man   is   nature...is this such a good idea???" Sigh. We had a dam good time, though.    Most Daring thing I did:   Wear my new skimpy bikini in public at the Rio pool. I didn't move alot, however. No one needs to see that.      News that broke while I was away:     Um, we released control of Iraq, Um we turned Saddam over, Ithink, and uh, oh yeah...JK Rowling released the title of the sixth Harry Potter book!

      A trip to Universal Studios last Tuesday inspired me to watch  The Great Outdoors  with John Candy and Dan Aykroyd. I have never seen this movie before. Now, I suppose that to most people this movie would fall under the category of comedy. But let me tell you, when you have a Roman (Aykroyd) in your family, and you've been on vacation with him, this movie hits a little to close to home. Thus, for someone like me, this movie falls under the category of horror.  I think my first, last, and only camping trip with my Uncle Roman will prove to be a good case in point. Although in the movie, Roman shows up unannounced, my Uncle Roman was invited along - on a previously planned camping trip with my family and our family's friends. As a matter of fact, it was our friends idea in the first place.  As most people know, when you reach a campsite, you stake it out and decide as a group how to arrange the camp, set up the tents, and create your weekend community. (You should be cringing right about now.) Yes, my Uncle Roman pulls ahead of the rest of us (refusing to stop for more than a five minute lunch on our six hour drive to Mackinac Island) and arrives at the campground an hour ahead of time. We arrive to find that we have been assigned 3 side by side rectangular campsites, and mu Uncle Roman has his van parked and his giant tent set up smack dab in the middle of the middle camp site. (Reminder: He was invited along and he chose which campsite to use) Due to his set up, we weren't able to set up in a circle, and we had to walk around the van and tent to visit each others sites. If you can't envision it, trust me, it was inconvenient, annoying, and rude.  There were numerous other examples of my delightful Uncle Roman on this trip. His potato hashbrown tomato casserole (that was an unusual shade of pink when he finished with it) that he insisted everyone "try" (and his definition of "try" was about 2 cups full splattered on to a paper plate). His argumentative response to asking him to at least park his van on the outer edge of the camp site. Oh and of course, who can forget the repeated visits we got from our neighbors at the camp ground as they politely, and repeatedly, requested that Uncle Roman turn down his TELEVISION that he had set up in his tent to watch late at night in the middle of the campground.  Ah, those family vacations!

      Well, folks, this is it. We are on the downhill stretch. The final Dark Tower book will be published in September (I believe on Stephen King's birthday.) I am so excited. I almost ready. I just finished Bag of Bones (really good!) , so I have read every novel Stephen King has put out, as well as Richard Bauchman. I have not read all of his short stories, but I read "Everything's Eventual," and I will read the other short stories that pertain to the Dark Tower series.  I also plan to reread Insomnia, since I read it so long ago, and it strongly relates to the Dark Tower series.  So my plan is: reRead Insomnia Possibly reread Salem's Lot. Read The Mist (short story from Skeletan Crew) Read Little Sisters of Eularia (spell?)  - short story from Everything's Eventual And then....duh duh duh...  read the dark tower series from start to finish. (rereading the first four.)  I am so excited.  After I finish theh dark tower series, I don't know what I am going to do. There are still quite a few works (his non fiction, his screen plays such as storm of the century, which does...loosely... relate to the dark Tower so I will eventually read it...but after the Dark Tower series I may need to take a King break. or else, I will run out of King material!!!!  Laterz!

      Well its been a while since I've updated. I know, no Amazing Race or anything! Oh well. What have I been up to? First and foremost, trying to put this house into some semblance of order.  Which, I am discovering, is a much more difficult task than even I had imagined. Those of you that have owned homes have some inkling of what I am talking about, I am sure. It is difficult though, because it isn't as though i moved into an empty house. So trying to find room for all of our stuff, along with all the stuff that is already here, is a fairly difficult task. (And considering the size of the house, well, you can just imagine.)  Anyway, the way things have pretty much been going is I clean out one room, moving everything into other rooms, which then causes those rooms to need cleaning out. However, I am trying my darndest to keep moving in one direction. (Once I get a room cleaned out, I don't move anything back into it.)  Originally, I tried to just make all the rooms presentable. But there is just too much damn stuff.  I finally got one of the bedrooms compleatly cleared out upstairs, so I am moving all of by brother's and sister's things into that room. Hopefully it will all fit. (They also have a bunch of stuff in the garage that may eventually get moved up into that bedroom so we have more room in the garage so that maybe things like the tool kit can live there instead of on the floor in the family room. Sigh. see what I mean?) My dad's stuff is all being moved into the den.  You may ask, "why don't you just call the fam-damily and tell them to get their stuff?" Well, suffice it to say that my brother and sister just aren't in a position to come and get their stuff and bring it anywhere. And I am not comfortable with just throwing it out. But I do need them to come and look through it and make sure it isn't all crap (which it probably is) and decide what they truly want to keep. At some point they'll have to get it (particularly is I ever decide to have children, they might enjoy having a bedroom of their own).  Ahem...(let me repeat...) eventually THEY"ll HAVE TO COME AND GET IT...hint, hint.....  Other than that, lets see, I went and picked up my teachers manuals so I could start to look through them. We spend like four weeks on addition. One page in the science book consists of, "The wind can blow hard. It can blow a windmill to make electricity. The wind can be very strong." And the first two weeks are a review of the letters of the alphabet! Life is grand.  Well, thats is for now. I think I'll do  summary of the last few episodes of Amazing Race (my view of the teams, a little commentary on the plot, nothing too deep.) And maybe some Big Brother assessment. We shall see.  Mostly, I want to get working in the Living room before it gets too hot.  ::::hugs::::

      People are weird.  I, however, think I must be the weirdest of all.  I have always been out of touch with my peers.   At various times in my life, I consoled myself with thoughts such as, "Weird is normal, so normal is weird."   But at some time in my life, I am just going to have to come to terms with the fact that I am very, very different. Sometimes that is okay, occasionally, it can bother me big time.   Is that weird?
