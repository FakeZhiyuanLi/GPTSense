      Congrats to me. I'm a illegal alien. All thanks to the company PRO for this achievement. This points to the question of racial discrimination and company policies in Dubai. Though a liberal country, the labour ministry and it's policies are often critised for it's in-humane treatment towards the working labour class. Employees find their basic rights "over-ridden" by tough and inexplicable labour laws. Personally, I think it's a sham. While the countries' top visionaries "dream" globally, little attention is paid to the expat communities.

      Why do all the dumb "extro" blonds in a typical school end up as secretaries or in administration jobs in an MNC? Ah, the very essence of masochism in a typical male brain. Called "thought discrimination" as coined by Freud; "fate" as proclaimed by the spiritualists.  Anyways, these pretty things bring immense joy and are great stress-busters in a typical "heated" office environment. But hang on, there are exceptions. Ever heard of the movie "Legally Blond"?    Detouring to Dubai news, visa applications and processing has now become online. The government relies heavily on the internet. Is it becoming too heavy? A much welcomed move, this would reduce the much despised queues and leads to faster processing. Whatever it maybe, I'm still awaiting my visa and there seems to be no change in the application status. If only the PROs' were "responsible".

      Where does a typical Gulf Mallu go on vacation? Kerala, of course. And with him goes numerous goodies for family and friends.  Big, bright, red and yellow boxes with carefully stringed pink ribbons. These are freighted by air on special discounts offered by airliners. "Sourcing" says the typical mallu. If you have sources in the airlines, you could ship twice the mass limit. Why?    The Oxford says "Vacation: Leisure time away from work devoted to rest or pleasure." So does the gulf mallu "vacation"? Typical statistics say 10% of mallus' do actually vacation, which is quite a growing minority, wherein, few choose Kerala as the departure point. The rest could be found loitering, wandering, running errands and what not at various places in their home-town. The typical gulf mallu vacation is a very carefully planned and scheduled event. Following the Santa Claus' trail, no homes are missed. All goodies delivered. No one is forgotten. Lest one invite hell upon himself in the form of gossip and back bite. Why all this trouble? Considering the stress and strain, the working conditions one encounters in the middle-east, the gulf mallu must be entilted to not just a month, but months of vacation and stress-busting. God save the gulf mallu!

      So...I've decided to begin my foray into the blogging world. All thanks to the internet and blogger.com for this adventure.   Morning begins quite well with the usual bowl of cornflakes and apples. I had decided years before to keep the doctor at bay. The american beheading is the news of the day. I guess his fate was sealed the moment he was kidnapped and held hostage, so why the hue and cry. Probably, be another role-play by the CIA, with a "civilian-contractor" label on his head. The american leaders handled the scene pretty well. No negotiations they said, despite, all the requests and pleas by the poor man's family members. Here,  One is reminded of the selfish indians whose relatives were held hostage during the Indian Airlines episode; pressured their government into releasing terrorists from indian jails.  Yes, we indians lack courage and character. Through all the bragging and barking, we fail to realize that India plays host to an ancient civilisation - the once fearsome warriors that ruled nations.   After all the pretty sights in the papers, comes the commuting time. Much awaited; much depressing. Cya tomorrow, as Vala says.

      Ever imagine virus on a mobile phone. 29A has it all! This hacker group has invented a new virus called "Cabir" which propogates itself via blue-tooth tech. The virus spreads itself by wire-less signals, ofcourse. The aftermath; one would have to constantly recharge the battery, as most of its' power is spent scanning for other blue-tooth enabled devices. Interesting. So we could now look forward to norton anti-virus for mobiles!

      So..the US Army is finally downscaling its size. After months of debates and furious oppositions, the Army has learnt nothing from it's experiences but defeat. Saddam Hussein might have been removed, but the resolve of the Iraqi people has only grown. America can no longer blind the world with its "reasons" for the war.

      How I wish to be urbane...The essence of the civilised world. The mark of a man. But how does one develop an urbane character? Travel. Social experience, as the term defines. It's a challenge to find an urbaner. Arduous to find a female urbaner. Simple conclusion: Travel. Socialise. Thus, developing ones' skill in language and culture...one becomes urbane, refined, polished in etiquette and social deportment. How I wish to be urbane...
