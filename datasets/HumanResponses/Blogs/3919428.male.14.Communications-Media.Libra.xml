      The second day was pretty empty. Woke up at 6:30 to eat "breakfast". After we all had put cheese on the bread we headed to the bus for another lovely 15 hours of riding the bus. That day i decided to put on my hat!  urlLink My hat  Boy did i have fun with my hat! Like when i felt like crap i could hide my face in it, when i was tired i could use it as a pillow! I love my hat.  So after 15 hours of listening to wannabes squeak we finally made it there, to the Czech Republic. You could tell that you were close in Poland, when the mountains started, those were nice mountains, i liked those mountains.  We reached our camping an hour late but it's always like that. Before arriving we got notified that a group of germans were already there, i was thinking "oh yay, perhaps they're normal" but when we reached the camping i noticed a group of german guys waving to us, my heart stopped. But when i looked left i noticed the girls, all was dandy once more.  Since we were late we had to head straight to the so-called diner. And hey, the food was great as it always is in the Czech Republic. After we(as in the 66 people) had left the diner we walked passed those nice little german guys and heard wicked quotes like "ESTONIAS SUCKS". It was funny, not because i enjoy being insulted, but because they're English could match a 6 year old. But the german girls seemed quite okay so everything was dandy once more...  So me and my 2 classmates entered our totally Ã¼ber wicked camping house. When we entered one of the four legs of the table fell off. At that moment we knew that our house was special.  After we had unpacked which in other words means thrown our baggages in the corner we went to check what's going on outside. The germans or somebody had organized a disco there, it was nice with fucked up trance megahits. I hate trance, i'd rather listen to N'sync than trance.  We had a stroll around the site, we had a pool on our camping site. It was said to be one of the biggest outdoor pools in the world, sweet.  After strolling about the first beers were bought, they had only one sort but thank god it was Staropramen. The only beer i actually like(of the ones i've tasted) The big group of people we had gathered near the pool just to chill out. We had some beers and some people started smoking, personally i hate it, i find nothing good about it, tastes like shit and ruins your health. But hey people do it.  At some time our teacher passed us, thank god she rocks. One of the limited samples of teachers, the ones who remember that they too were once young.  Me and my 2 mates stayed up until there was still something happening on the site. Too many little things so i'm not gonna write about them. It all ended at about 4:30 in the morning,(although everyone had to be hushed up in their rooms at 11:00) so we decided to get some rest too.  Good night.

      Today was another one of those&nbsp;get up early, eat shit, ride for an hour and play tennis days.&nbsp; I got home, dropped dead on my bed as usual and continued behind the computer after 5 minutes.&nbsp; Even though i was exhausted i was still hyper about my new radio job. Yes, for those who don't know, i'm an internet DJ. I recently got my own show on FNR Radio  urlLink http://fnr.uk.to &nbsp;(we're moving to a dot-com address though). Had some fun with the station today, broadcasted off-time to a small audience(but a new audience!).   Later in the day, out of the blue Sigrid aka Siku(whose blog address i cannot publish for i dont know it) reminded me of the old cartoon i used to watch all the time. CAPTAIN PLANET ... he's a hero...gonna take pollution down to zero, stuff like that.&nbsp; With the planeteers, and the rings and everything, earth, fire, winnnnd, water, heart ... captain planet...&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.turner.com/planet/static/ &nbsp;anyway it brought back good memories, and later in the day i remembered that i had a&nbsp;huge crush on the winnnnnd chick back then.   Later in the day with the tune of "captain planet, he's a hero" in my head i went to watch Chicago, not the movie or something sleezy like that, the real show, the real thing. I have to admit it was great as i expected, even with the rain, and who cares about the rain anyway, Estonians are used to rain.   Later on siku gave me the link to some  urlLink http://www.johntitor.com  guy. I read it, what a load of crap ^^ Why the hell was he on forums when he was a mega mighty captainplanetish timetraveler. I mean surely he had heard of blogger by then.   DJ JoeraZ(me) says: and by 2036 im gonna be fuckin' 50 already so i wont give a fuck about time-travel  Linyi(siku) says: haha  Linyi says: ..  Linyi says: fuck.  Linyi says: i'm gonna be&nbsp;51  DJ JoeraZ says: oldie oldie

      Barabing! I'm back, whoosh.  This blog is mainly for the Czech sheila Crystal who wanted to know about her country that she doesnt live in... awkward.  Let the games begin.   Day 1    &nbsp; Woke up in my bed, yawned my last yawn in Estonia and dragged myself up to get dressed. Very much like me i set the alarm clock 30 minutes earlier so i could simply have time to waste. After making a small breakfast i noticed the taxi guy alredy arrived with 30 minutes spare time, he probably had the same problem as i did.   So when the time had come i dragged my bags to the taxi. After a fast ride with the unorthodox taxi driver i reached my bus station where some people were actually waiting, BEFORE ME! That's simply insane, i'm always the first losah to get there.   So there we were waiting for the bus, we were told that some other school was picked up before us, our hopes were high. As the bus slowly came to a stop we noticed... those are fuckin' 7 year olds! I was stunned for a second but i still got on that bus. Sweating like before a trial and biting my nails our bus reached it's third stop near the third school. What a relief, older people! So we were fully, 66 people, 30 of them like 7-12 but that was okay.&nbsp;   The bus was a doubledecker of course.&nbsp; On the higher level there were.. the 7-12 year olds, some wannabe babes and "sk8erboys" and us, as in people from our school, thank god for us. WE were at the back of the bus, there were 8 of us there me,&nbsp;3 of my classmates and some girls who were one grade higher than us. There were also 2 more people from our school but they were&nbsp;@ the front with the idiots.  The lower level of the bus consisted of teachers, and the people i ended up being with @ the trip. I would've done anything to get to the lower level, not away from my school, no they were nice and fun, but away from those fucking wannabes. The back of the bus as in us met with the lower level(only the&nbsp;girls then)&nbsp;some time on the first day, it wasnt hard to notice that they were different from the regular gray mass, like us. So in a way they were our saviours.   After like 18 hours we reached our hotel in Poland(bylastok) because we werent gonna drive 36 hours straight. Me and two of my classmates got a room there and soon after settling in we went outside where we met up with the other 5 of our school.   The interesting part of it    &nbsp;  So this is the part where 50 year olds say: "so young!" and so on. That's why i name it the interesting part.   Luckily none of my relatives read this blog so i have nothing to be ashamed of.   Even though i had brough a bottle of vodka from Estonia along especially for Poland it wasnt enough. Because it could only be enough for me and my classmate, the third in our room wasnt a drinker and there is nothing wrong with that. The 8 of us knew that Poland wasnt like Hungary or the Czech Republic were alcohol is just handed to you but luckily we met with some older people who were also Estonian and happy enough to buy stuff for us.  Back to the hotel, we started off together but then people in my room went back to it to start with our part. We started with the 0,3 l vodka, since there was so little of it we made drinks with it and man oh man that was enough! Maybe because i hadnt drank in a year or so or maybe because the vodka i brought was like a mix between 40% and 80% (a) After we had finished with that we had one left so we went strolling about the hotel, we had nothing to fear because the teacher from our school was a person. Which means that she remembered that she was our age once. We met up with the people from the lower level of the bus(just the guys that time), went to their room, had some fun, stuff like that, they were kind enough to give us a beer, in return we gave them some vodka. Which ended up with us still having a can of beer and an almost full vodka bottle in the morning. No hangover, no nothing, just some regular fun ;)   &nbsp;

      Everything's just hunky dory today !  &nbsp;  I woke up happy today, rather late, but happy. Probably because i'm going away to the Czech Republic tomorrow so i can leave this shi..ny nice place.&nbsp; I'm loving it, although i do keep on worrying that i might forget something. Maybe if im bored(and when the Titanic reaches New York) i'll blog from there, i wouldnt count on it though, and i doubt anyone cares because i continue my long path of no readers. I am almost enlightened, almost(!) but i still have much to learn about getting some comments.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I know i still have to order a cab but that's easy for an experienced guy like me! Meanwhile the sandwiches i made today were perfect! Phew, i was seriously worried. And everything is packed but i better repack.  &nbsp;   take me down to the Prague city where the beer is cheap and the girls are pretty, take me home!

      Weird enough i just found out pats! is something like boom! in dutch. Some friends from belgium noticed my nickname Patsy and told me that, thanks guys, i feel so much better now. Pats! &nbsp; So i decided to update for my own amusement since nobody actually reads this blog. Mm yes. &nbsp; So today i woke up like happyman from happyland but to be perfectly honest the day has been under average. Practically everything i've done has well softly said sucked. Even the sandwhich i made sucked and that says a lot. I mean if u make a sandwhich what can go wrong. &nbsp;   You put on too much butter  You forget to put on butter  You forget the topping   I probably put on too much butter..   What else is notable.. bumhats, i forgot..   Oh yeah and to top it all off i cant get that song "what's your number" out of my head. Damn this DJ work!

      On wednesday i woke up at 8:30 as on the other training days. I think it's simply sick and foul that i have to wake up early in the morning in summer, take a cold shower, drag myself to the bus stop, then ride for 30 mins, then get on a goddamned trolley and reach the tennis courts. Meanwhile at the trolley stop i took a small nap to catch up on my sleep. Only the fact that some old friends had also appeared to the courts that day cheered me up. I'm sad to say the training was well fucked that day, not only did i play like i was born yesterday, i played with this girl named Jennifer whose patience has limits. Respect to her for only whining twice that day. When i look back at it all, it probably wasnt the sleep that made me play like a 2 year old, it was probably her. I just get nervous every time i play her cause i know whatever i do wrong will be used against me in court! Anyway blah blah got soaked by rain stuff like that, couldn't care less, moving on.   After training i waited for some time because i had time. Now normally im used to taking the "special" cab home from the courts but the second way would be to ride back to central town and take a bus. Of course i never do that, but after training, when i was waiting crazy girl nr.2 came over. She normally takes the same bus that i get home with from central town, so she wanted me to go with that bus. Well sure i said "okay, why not" but deep in my evil mind i never actually planned to go there! But then she just waited with me in the hall and followed me so i had to go back to central, isnt that great. Anyway i normally thought of her as just some girl from tennis, well stuff changes. I seriously think she's just some mentally troubled girl from tennis now. Maybe it's because she always says what she thinks and what she thinks is simply looney. Okay she's not that bad but i do admit she scared me a bit. While waiting with her @ the bus stop in central i noticed some funky white doves. I liked those funky doves. I tried to catch one but it flew away. Bastard, still a funky bastard though.   Weird enough today(thursday) i had to wake up for another early morning training! Just got home. Going to town was a bit uncomfortable this time mainly because i had 3000 cash in my wallet. Why? Because i'm going to the Czech Republic on Sunday and i just got the money for it yesterday, so i'm carrying it in my wallet. Seriously all i thought about was: is the wallet still there? Happily home now, the wallet is safe in it's bed! It feels good to be back home except for the fact that the senile old coot of a cleaner is here. She's a woman in her 50-s or something who is supposed to be the cleaner of our house. Not a maid or anything fancy like that, just a cleaner. She seriously gets on my nerves so bad. With her fricken carrot voice. Doesn't know how to handle animals either, always shouting at our dogs, poor dogs. Although the worst part of her is that she cant shut the fuck up. Seriously, we pay her 2 times more than we should and she comes here for like 8 hours every week(one day) and spends 5 of it talking or drinking coffee. Even my grandpa dislikes her, and that says a lot!   Maybe i'll somehow manage to take a picture of her but in the meanwhile here's the cat that ran in my yard a few nights ago.  Due to the fact that the picture was taken in the middle of the night, you can only see the eyes, or well the 2 dots.

      Figured i'd get into the blogging business. In summer especially with this weather people do tend to get bored. And when u get bored u do stuff you normally don't, like wrestle a pillow or sing with your dogs. In the end in my case i just end up behind the computer. Oh sure i used to write poetry and songs and i still like singing BUT both of those became more like a job than a hobby. Simply because i cant do something without trying to make something out of it. Like when i wrote poetry at first it was for myself, then i started publishing. Then i just had a voice in my head: "write mortal, write, people are waiting!" And well duh yeah blogs are also published but atleast with blogs i dont have to worry about the rythm of my text or whether the last line rhymes with the previous one. I dont have to make up stuff like "Two sparks of deep love fire" i can just write "today i went out and got ambushed by a bunch of bums, how is that fair?!" Too bad where i live nothing ever happens, but hey last night when i was looking out of the window i saw a cat run in my yard!   So if you have read this far i bet you want to know: "who is that creep?"  Let me introduce myself. I'm just an ordinary kid so to speak. I dont pay taxes and i live off my parents' money. Yeah sure there's puberty to worry about, bad skin stuff like that but all in all life's not as bitchy as it will be in a few years ^^    I'm not gonna hide the fact that i can speak english better than an average American. But yet, i'm not English, i'm not American by far(although i am a big Michael Moore fan). I'm actually a 14 year old from Estonia(i'm just 14 going on 15). If you have made it this far you're thinking "wtf is Estonia". Here's a geography lesson for you: Estonia is in the western part of Europe, east of us there's Russia, if u look south you see Latvia, high above there's finland and to the west there's Sweden where people named Tobias live. Now many people who "know" stuff about Estonia(who arent our neighbours) think that we speak Russian here. May i be the first to tell you that's a load of bullcrap. I admit Estonia has been occupied by Russian forces in the past but that ended in 1989(or 1992 or something when the tanks finally left Estonia). The national language of Estonia is Estonian, always has been, always will. Estonian is nothing similar to Russian. It is in a group called Finnish-Ugri. Finnish and Hungarian are also Finnish-Ugri even though Hungarian is something very different. Anyway so much about Estonia then.  So far we've covered  1. Why am i doing this 2. Who am i 3. What is Estonia  If you're still reading, you're doing good dont worry!   Now about the address of my life which is ppffft.blogger.com or something like that. Ppfft is a sound people make when they think somebody is talking bullshit or when they aren't pleased with something. I like that sound, especially to spam in chatrooms.  [supermofo] I've got a golden Ford Sierra ! [entermynamehere] ppffft ^^  The name of my site is "Life's interesting?". I find the name very appropriate because sometimes my life can be interesting and sometimes i think why the hell am i here anyway?   Well i think that wraps up the introduction. Maybe if i actually start to like this i'll post stuff all the time but at the moment i'm just gonna post when i feel like it or well as i said before: when i have nothing better to do.  Blah blah be good, toodley doo and lame stuff like that. Priit   do not judge me by my name, foreign heathens!

      UPDATE! Im in living hell.  I know i know i should write about what happened in the Czech Republic, i should've wrote about it a long time ago but i guess back when i had the chance i was too lazy. Now something worse has happened. I'm in the country. I've been in my countryhome for almost 2 weeks(makes 2 tomorrow) and im dying. Now @ the end of summer when everybody comes back from the country i'm here. The thought depresses me. I miss everything back in town, i miss my friends, my radio, goddamn it i miss my computer. All i have here is a laptop and GPRS. Anyway the first days here, well i thought, oh yay the country. Yes i was sad because had to leave town but i was okay with coming here because of the renovation work that had been done to our country home. A week passed and i was beginning to get annoyed with it all. A few days later i popped. I cant take it anymore, yesterday i was so depressed i wrote songs. I haven't been poetic for a year :/ And the place im at  isnt so bad, it isnt about that. THERE IS NO ONE HERE. Just me, my family and some animals(who i have to clean). I have no crowd to entertain here so i entertain myself. I just do dumb stuff and use Weebl and Bob quotes. I sing to myself sometimes :| Not a day passes without me wanting to get back on the air at the radio station i love. I keep on watching music shows on television to find bands im interested in broadcasting. I always try to think of some way to make FNR radio more well known.     urlLink My station   I have 1 more week to last... must... stay... alive
