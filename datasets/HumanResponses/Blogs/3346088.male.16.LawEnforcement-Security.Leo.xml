      dude here are two GREAT ideas for books....some people dont appreciate talent when they see it   HiitsmeAlx: a bunch of midgets are being flown to africa right, they need them to work in the mines or something HiitsmeAlx: but then their plane crashes and they are stranded on an island HiitsmeAlx: but then that island was used for nuclear testing HiitsmeAlx: so some of the midgets shrink or grow HiitsmeAlx: so then theres big midgets and littluns HiitsmeAlx: then one of the midgets can make weapons HiitsmeAlx: so he like takes a tree and makes a cannon HiitsmeAlx: but then one of the lazy midgets isnt paying attention and he shoots a hole in the rescue boat HiitsmeAlx: oh yea and they can see the shore of america, but since theyre midgets sharks would eat them HiitsmeAlx: so they cant get there  YEA that one will win me a nobel peace prize  k heres my other one   HiitsmeAlx: a bunch of midgets, get sent as slaves to some new continent they just found next to asia, but they only leave one big person in charge, so the midgets kill him, and they build a MIDGET TOWN, and all the doors and stuff are smaller for midget size, so then the big people try to come back and take their city, but they cant use anything because its all too small for them and the midgets end up beating them in war   heres what lindsey came up with... OXISunKissedIXo: this one little girl was sheltered her whole life OXISunKissedIXo: and then one day she hooked up with a guy that works with her dad OXISunKissedIXo: and she gets aids OXISunKissedIXo: so shes like screw this im gonna live life to the fullest sice im gonna die OXISunKissedIXo: so she runs around the country robbing banks and killing midgets OXISunKissedIXo: and in the end its ironic cuz shes running away from the police and she is slowed down by a PARADE OF MIDGETS  OXISunKissedIXo: so the cops catch up to her and she kills herself     sorry i wasted your life...

      heh overal the show was good, but there were bad parts, like there were so many freakin people into metal it was lame. they like stood on the sides of the freakin pits and kicked people and then went back to the sides like little bitches.god they all sucked and like the pit sucked because no one wanted to go in, and it was empty for like 30 seconds at a time it was so lame.  But yea anyways the good parts were as i lay dying and in flames. the first band that played was all wack called the dog and pony show or somethin, it sounded like a porno movie. yea but of course as i lay dying was freakin awesome at playing, and then in flames was funny. he could sing in like perfect english, but he had the fattest accent in the world so yea it was worth the money at least and now im all freakin tired and crap so im gonna sleep

      ok yea so on sunday i went to lindseys house with ricky and my family, and yea that was pretty interesting. lindseys niece is soo annoying holy crap i wanted to kick her ass so bad but i had to restrain myself and then yea lindseys family wanted me to do karaeoke so we just hid in this little room the whole time, and we played darts and i freakin own in darts, i could be an all american dart thrower. yea so then after we hung out at lindseys she came over to my house and we went up on this giant hill to watch the fireworks, but by the time we got there they were already done and this guy thought he was all cool so he called us laggers, and yea then lindsey had to leave so i went home and then we talked on the phone...and yea i bet more happened but it happened so long ago i cant remember  mmk monday i didnt do anything except play games and be bored and then i talked to lindsey on the phone  tuesday uhh was ok lindsey me and ricky all went to the mall, and i ended up not buying anything cause i was all poor and stuff but lindsye got a game and some books so yea she probably hates shopping with us now, mk then after that i went to wrestling and got hurt which sucked for..  wednesday, the big day of the week. man my back was hurting bad and my band had its first show at this tiny bar and diner thing, so yea i LOAded up on medicine (i took over 3000 mg of ibuprofin in like 5 hours) soo i was pretty high on that crap all night, and then yea me and lindsey tried to stay up till 4 30 on the phone and then all my cable went out at like 3 i was so pissed i couldnt watch tv or go on the computer or talk or anything, holy crap that was so lame. oh yea but about the show, man so many people came to see us it was such an awesome show , i almost hit these people who came in the face because i was swinging my bass around so much, but yea the sucky part about the show was there wasnt enough space (for the audience or our band) and the PA system kept cutting out which was pissing us off, but yea all in all it was good, you guys should buy our demo it sounds a lot better than it did at our show  mk and today tried to go to the movies, but no one could go so now im just sitting here having another day like monday, but i guess its allright mmk yea tomorrow is the last day ill be with lindsey before she leaves so im sad about that, but im sick of writing so later everyone

      hey um i havent updated in like 3 weeks but who cares barely anyone reads this stupid thing anyways, i only write in it because im whipped but whatever lol so yea in the two weeks lindsey was gone i really didnt do anything, the coolest thing we did was me ricky and megan went to the movies, and we saw parts of three different movies, and only white chicks was any good, and then we almost got in a fight with megans mom over bush and yea that was pretty cool i suppose, but yea then like after 2 weeks i finally got to see lindsey, but like only for 3 hours so that was really gay and we played this game but it had a computer and the computer cheated for lindsey so of course i lost, and yea then i had to say goodbye again and it was lame so yea then i left for a week to go to lake shasta, which was pretty good but it had like the worst timing for a trip ever but yea the day after i saw lindsey i spent like 10 hours in a bus driving up to sacramento, and then another 3 or 4 hours the next day driving to the lake...those days sucked really bad...and then we got to the lake, and yea for the rest of that week i didnt touch real ground at all, i was just on boats floating in the middle of the lake for the rest of the time, but yea it was cool...so what i did up there was i went wakeboarding, but i sucked really bad and i couldnt even stand up on the board but yea i almost got it the last time i went, i bet if i went again i could probably stand up but yea the best water sport thing we did was tubing, where like 3 people got dragged behind a speed boat in a giant rubber tube at like 40-60 miles an hour, and like you hit the wake the boat made and went flying, and thats where all the cool stuff happened... like one time i grabbed onto galen and we hit the wake and we both flew out of the boat and when we hit the water our heads collided really hard and yea we both felt like we almost passed out thank god for life jackets, and then yea one time we hit a huge bump and me and galen fell out and it was only chris left inside and i guess they hit another bumb and the tube flipped over on chris and he was probably dragged underwater for a while before he fell out...and yea some other cool things happened i just cant remember now...and then yea we also did backflips and stuff off of the house boats into the lake which was pretty fun because i could do a flip and im proud of myself...but yea after all that i had to spend another freaking two days in a bus and it really sucked but not as much as the trip up there casue i slept alot, and yea then when i got home i got to see lindsey for like 4 or 5 hours which was cool and we watched some movie where the steal the SAT scores, i think its called perfect score or something, and yea then she left but it was cool we talked till almost 4 until her dad got all pissed and yea we were close to the record, but you guys wouldnt understand, and then yea today her and emerson and ricky came over and we played egyptian war and kent and i sucked today i didnt win at all and then yea then we played james bond on x box, and i owned i definitly made up for my suckyness during cards, and then yea i cant remember what we did next...but then we went to the movies and we saw harold and kumar go to (whatever) white castle and yea its such a stoner movie, if your a guy you will like it but if your a girl you might not i dunno go see it its way funny...and yea then we got in n out and then lindsey came over and now im here mmmk thats all for now
