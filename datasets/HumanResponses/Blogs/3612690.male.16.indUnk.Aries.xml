      How funny. Right now I am awaiting for my father to come and pick me up so I can live with him.   I just returned from a visit in Ontario with my mum and her husband.... whilst there I got caught stealing CDs from HMV.  When we got home, my mum started blabbering on about stealing blah blah. Then, my fucking step-father buts his fucking nosey nose in to the thing. I said something [I don't remember what] to my mum, then he started staring at me trying to intimidate me or something. "Shut up, you..." he says. So I said "say it."  Needless to say, it escalated from there. I ended up calling him "a fucking asshole" and I said I wished he would die. "He's leaving tommorow!" he proclaimed. I talked to my dad on the phone and we arranged things.  In the morning, I was packing up my drums. My mother wouldn't let me take 3 stands because she claimed they were given to me and my brother, therefore I couldn't take them. I asked my brother if I could have them.. and he said yes, because he doesn't even play drums. Despite this, my mother still wont let me have them. While we were arguing about it, she started pushing me. I kept telling her I would call the cops if she kept doing it. When she pushed me one time I grabbed her hand and said "stop it."  Now I'm waiting for my dad. Hopefully my brother can sneak me my stands or something.

      I just got back from drum camp. I was there for one week.  At first, it was bad because I didn't know anyone  then I met some people and it was good.  it kind of alternated.  There was a really cute boy there.   :sigh:  :)

        I feel    Gonna start drumz camp tommorow. Gonna be thinking about Steff whole time. I hope she doesn't think I'm a stalker and that's she just she doesn't because she wants to be nice. IIIII...... I'm being too mean to myself. Gotta think positive. Take it at face value. Just live and love and be happy and O God. I wanna be happy.  I want us to be happy.

      I used to think something. Now I don't think I think that anymore.  xfkcu: I thought she was into me but I don't think so :-( Iove and pistoIs: why? xfkcu: I dunno. Gaylen showed me messages and she was like "I want him" (reffering to me) xfkcu: and we talked a lot and she was always like "haha. you make me so happy." xfkcu: but lately.. I don't get that vibe anymore. xfkcu: oh well.  Now I just realise I was making stupid assumptions. Sigh.
