       urlLink Chicago Tribune Swiftboat skipper Kerry critics wrong   What else is it going to take to diffuse the false allegations made by the opportunist Swift Boat Veterans for Truth? Here is an account of the events in Vietnam these men question as told by William B. Rood, an editor for the Chicago Tribune, who was a swift boat commander on the same mission where Senator Kerry's actions earned him a Silver Star. Mr. Rood   fully debunks   the SBVT's claims and  between his account ,  the account's from the men who were on Senator Kerry's boat ,  and   Navy records  it is crystal clear that the SBVT is nothing more than   a sleazy smear group   bent on nothing more than clouding the issues landscape to keep voters' focus away from the Bush Administration's failed tenure in office.  Click on over to the Chicago Tribune to read the full account. You'll have to register with them, however it's free.  If SBVT is so interested in the TRUTH, maybe they should focus their efforts on finding out where President Bush was during 1972/73 while he was supposed to be serving in the National Guard in Alabama.

      From the Chicago Tribune:  Harkin Calls Cheney's Words and Actions    'Cowardly'     August 17, 2004 DES MOINES -- Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa pushed the name-calling in the presidential race to a new level Monday, calling Vice President Dick Cheney a coward for not serving in Vietnam and cowardly for his criticism of John Kerry.  Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, recently said that if elected he would pursue a more effective and "more sensitive war on terror that reaches out to other nations and brings them to our side and lives up to American values in history."  Cheney, in campaign speeches, has been mocking that reference to sensitivity. Harkin, a former Navy fighter pilot, said, "It just outrages me that someone who got five deferments during Vietnam and said he had `other priorities' at that time would say that."  He said President Bush and Cheney are "running scared because John Kerry has a war record and they don't." He said of Cheney, "What he is doing and what he is saying is cowardly. The actions are cowardly."  "When I hear this coming from Dick Cheney, who was a coward, who would not serve during the Vietnam War, it makes my blood boil," said Harkin. "He'll be tough, but he'll be tough with someone else's kid's blood."  Republican National Committee spokesman David James dismissed the criticism as shrill and negative.  Cheney received five student and marriage deferments of military service. Bush was in the Texas Air National Guard.  Copyright © 2004,  urlLink Chicago Tribune    Finally someone gets pissed off and says so! It takes someone with the stones of Tom Harkin to tell it exactly like it is. Day by day the message is getting out that the emperor has no clothes...and not much of a brain either.  By the way, can you think of a worse job than spokesman for the Republican National Committee? This guy's wife must steam clean him before allowing him in the house each night.  Kerry/Edwards in 04

      Yesterday I watched President Bush lean on a podium, cock his eyebrow the way he does, and ask Senator John Kerry if he would have gone to war knowing then what he knows today. Mr. Kerry responded to that question saying that he would have given the President the authority to go to war, however he would have done such things as exhausted his options with the weapons inspectors first and would have build a true international coalition. Mind you Senator Kerry’s decision is based in part on having actually served in a war zone, took enemy fire, made decisions under fire, and received wounds in war.  It seems like whenever President Bush and Vice President Dick ‘Deferment’ Cheney question Senator Kerry’s policy or votes, the Senator usually responds in some way. Now I have a few questions for President Bush and Vice President Cheney and since they’re not real good at answering questions:  1) Mr. President, why did you resist appointing a commission to look into the 9/11 tragedy and then why did you and your administration not easily and full cooperate with the commission early on.  2) Why you have to be shamed into appearing before the commission and only relented to appear if Vice President Deferment could appear with you?  3) Why didn’t you and Vice President Deferment swear on a bible to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? By not agreeing to swear doesn’t that give you a license to lie?  4) Why are you not bothered by someone in your administration outing a CIA agent? That’s against the law; are you and yours above the law?  5) Mr. President, why didn’t you go to war with the adequate troop strength as suggested by the Army Chief of Staff General Eric K. Shinseki?  6) Why did you invade Iraq without completing the invasion of Afghanistan by extinguishing al Queda?  7) Why did you let Osama Bin Laden go at Tora Bora?  8) Why did you send American men and women into a war zone without adequate supplies?  9) Why is your Coalition of the Willing made up of over 80 percent of American forces (140,000 versus 27,000 forces)  10) Why have the casualties been overwhelmingly American (over 88 percent)? Wait, I took math in school – I think I can answer that question.  11) Mr. President, why didn’t you take the medical physical you were required to take in order to be allowed to fly during your ah hem, military service in the early 1970? By not taking the physical you were disqualified from the piloting duties you signed up to do, thus costing this country thousands in wasted training dollars.  12) Mr. President, where were you doing those months that can’t be accounted for in your military records? Without a solid, straightforward accounting many Americans believe you went AWOL – don’t you care?  13) In a debate against Vice President Gore in the 2000 election you said that your tax cut would be targeted toward middle and lower income Americans. But the richest Americans received the bulk of your tax cuts. Did you Flip Flop?  14) Your administration wrote and lobbied for a prescription benefits bill that costs $150B more than it was advertised. Why did your administration threaten the job of the person who had the real cost figures?  15) Why are prescription drugs primarily more expensive for senior citizens now, after your Prescription Drug Bill was passed, than before?  16) When you said you would fix the educational system in this country, why did you offer an unfunded mandate based on testing, rather than addressing the multitude of issues surrounding education in this country?  I plenty of more questions, however I think it take everything you have to answer these 16. Get your research staff and spinmeisters working on these – I’ll have more for you at a later date.

      One reason columnists and comedians will be sad to see President Bush go is because of the loss of actual quotes to write and joke about.  He's a cornucopia of material. For instance yesterday the President spoke to a rally in nearby Annandale, Virginia.  As reported in The DailyPress.com (Hampton, Virginia):   "Bush criticized Kerry's plan to eliminate the tax cuts for those making more than $200,000 a year, saying that the "the rich in America happen to be the small business owners" who put people to work.    Bush also said high taxes on the rich are a failed strategy because "the really rich people figure out how to dodge taxes anyway."    Kind of reminds you of the clip in Fahrenheit 9/11 where the President talks to his supporters, "...The Haves and the Have More," at a black tie dinner. If I follow his logic we should do away with many of our laws because criminals figure out to dodge them anyway. Hmmmmm.   However there's a statement in the last paragraph of the story by a Bush supporter at the rally.  Talking about Kerry supporters who were protesting at the rally, she said,   "I just look at them and smile," she said.  "They're damn lucky to be in this country because they would be backslapped if they lived anywhere else. I just pray that they will open their eyes."    I have to agree with her that it is a privilege to have the freedom to express ones feelings, but I get the feeling that she's one of those people who think it's OK to express ones feelings as long as you agree with me.  Otherwise...'we'll find you...'    To read the complete article click on over to the following link.   urlLink

      I can't think of a better way to initiate my blog than by posting the exchange President Bush had with an American Indian reporter at a conference for minority journalists. Go to this link:  urlLink http://www.majorityreportradio.com/weblog/archives/000581.php  and get ready to both laugh and scratch your head.  When one reflects on all the gaffes and poor decisions (wrong, misinformed, uninformed, corrupt, cast with a blind eye, etc.) this president has made, I honestly wonder how anyone can:  1) Be proud to have voted for Bush 43 2) Speak up for him today 3) Vote for him tomorrow 4) Claim him as one of yours  In my years of voting eligibility I have never supported a candidate who was the embarassment that Bush 43 has been and currently is. In 2000 I said that I couldn't vote for a candidate who was no smarter than I. In 2004 I say that I not only can't vote for him, but I will communicate information and arguments to hopefully open voter's eyes. I hate to paint whole groups of people with a broad brush, but in this world of sound-bite attention spans I advance the following: In the 1980s I came to the conclusion that the Republican Party was the party of 'I Got Mine.' George W. Bush is the poster child for that party characterization.
