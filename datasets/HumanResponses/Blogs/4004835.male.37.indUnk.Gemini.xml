      I was talking to Mrs. Slidge, and she is having a difficult time trying to figure out why Bush appeals to so many people.  She points out that Kerry is engaged in a lot of activities that most people would normally find pretty cool -- snowboarding, hockey, electric guitar.  Bush, on the other hand, keeps falling off his mountain bike and apparently hasn't mastered the fine art of watching football and eating pretzels at the same time.  Yet, Kerry is the one criticized for being a weenie.  I think we all know who the  real  weenie is.

      This is classic.  The Bush Administration today released its projections on GDP, saying that they expect real GDP to increase to 4.7% this year, and slowing to 3.7% in 2005.  This projection would normally make sense, as last quarters GDP was 4.5%.  Of course, the projection came out a few hours after they announced that  this  quarters GDP is 3.0%.  On top of that, they project that the deficit is a record $445 billion, an increase of $71 billion over last year's shortfall.  And they are spinning this as a positive!  According to the Bush Admin, the  original  projection was for a deficit of $521 billion!  So, although the deficit is the  worst it has ever been , they are proud of themselves because  it could have been worse !!  In his acceptance speech last night, John Kerry said:  "They say this is the best economy we've ever had. And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist. Well, here is our answer: There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better." This is  exactly  what he was referring to. The Bush Administration gives us a record deficit and then attempts to tell us that we can't do better.

      The new campaign motto for President Bush is the extraordinarily weak "We're turning the corner.  There's no turning back."  Well, Mr. President, I know what's around that corner.  It's a pretty seedy part of town.  I, personally, would like to go back and get on the Interstate.

      According to the  urlLink Associated Press , George Bush has a "narrow" lead over Kerry in the electoral votes.  My own tracking poll shows a quite different result, with Kerry leading Bush  229  to  196 .  Bush actually went down 5 points today due to ARG's poll of West Virginia, which is now too close to call.  Not sure what the AP is using to determine their vote total, but one thing is certain -- since I started my tracking poll over two weeks ago, Kerry has never been behind Bush in either the votes outside the margin of error, votes where one candidate led the other in the poll by over 10%, or votes where the margin of error was discarded altogether.  --UPDATE--   urlLink Zogby   just released their battleground state polls.  Kerry picks up 9 votes to give him  238 , and Bush loses 20 votes to drop to  176  (in polls where the results are outside the margin of error).   Bush lost his votes in Ohio (with its 20 electoral votes), which had been slightly in favor of him, and has now fallen within the margin of error.

      The  urlLink Daily Howler , the premier website monitoring our  Media  (although  urlLink Media Matters  is another great website at exposing the Media's ability to lie baldfacedly with no shame), gives its take on the supposed "flip-flop" of John Kerry voting to authorize the war in Iraq, but voting  against  the $87 billion appropriations bill:  "Kerry’s votes were 'contradictory.' But if that’s true, what can we say about President Bush? After all, Bush decided to go to war in Iraq, then threatened to veto the $87 billion bill to funds the troops, helping bring it down to defeat the first time the Senate voted on it. Was that conduct 'contradictory' too? This must be the most obvious question on earth, but typists like [Joe] Klein aren’t going to raise it. Lazy, inept and deeply programmed, Manchurian typists—typists like Klein—only produce Approved Press Corps Scripts. When Kerry votes against one form of the $87 billion bill, that is puzzling, disturbing, 'contradictory.' When Bush helps defeat another form of the bill, that is ignored, never mentioned, quite acceptable. Readers, it’s all about typing up Approved Scripts, then heading off to swish cocktail parties where other flunkies tell Joe Klein how brilliant and savvy he is. Yes, President Bush initiated a war, then worked to defeat the spending bill that would have supported the troops! There was, of course, nothing wrong with that conduct; Bush favored a different form of the bill, and he was working to pass it. But guess what? Kerry also favored certain forms of the bill, and if the Senate had voted with him on his 'no' vote, they would have been forced to craft a new bill that might have been more to his liking. There was never a chance—never a chance—that the troops weren’t going to be funded."    Indeed. One question the Media should be asking is, "Why did President Bush threaten to veto a spending bill that would benefit the troops?" As I mentioned in my previous post, my gut feeling is that the bill provided too  much  for the troops, and not enough for Bush's benefactors.

       urlLink LadyLitBlitz , the author of a fine blog on writing, has asked whether we are going to have another "hanging chad scenario" in Florida, due to a recent report about Florida touch-screen voting booths not working.    My take?  Probably.  There is a lot of  urlLink talk  about how shoddy the voting machines are, and it doesn't take a professional conspiracy theorist to notice that a lot of the voting machine companies are run by Republican donors.  Add to this the inherent mess that is Florida, and you can come to your own conclusions as to the potential of another clusterf*** on the magnitude of the 2000 election.    And as I noticed in a previous post, what if things are  so  messed up in Florida that they do not submit their electoral votes to Congress?  Well, we end up with Congress selecting the President.    Great.  First the Judicial branch selects the President, then the Legislative branch picks the President.  The only option after that would be the Executive branch picking the President -- or, as I like to call it, a  dictatorship .    But surely that's just conspiracy theory.

      Only one poll out today, and that is for New Jersey. The poll was conducted by FD Public Mind and has Kerry leading Bush 45%-43% with a 3.5% MoE.  According to Public Mind:  "John Kerry has been relying on George W. Bush to give people a reason to vote for the Democratic ticket. While Bush's troubles have surely rallied the Democratic base and some Democratic-leaning independents, Kerry will solidify his position in New Jersey only when he gives voters a reason to vote for him rather than just against George Bush."  There have been previous polls in New Jersey, conducted by both Rasmussen and Quinnipiac University.  Qunnipiac polled New Jersey in May, and found Kerry leading Bush 46%-43% with a 2.9% MoE. Rasmussen followed two weeks later and found Kerry leading Bush by twelve points.  Qunnipiac's June poll showed Bush losing three points, giving Kerry a six point lead (46%-40%). Rasmussen's June poll showed Kerry remaining steady, with Bush picking up two points (giving Kerry a ten point 51%-41% lead).  Public Mind's thesis is that Kerry needs to give voters a reason to vote for him, rather than vote against Bush. It appears to me that Kerry has been holding steadily with ~45% of the vote, and Bush has been fluctuating (between 40% in the Qunnipiac poll to 43% in the Public Mind poll). This leaves ~15% of the voters without a decision. Those who have already chosen Kerry seem to be sticking with him, whereas Bush is gaining and losing support.  Kerry's speech tonight at the Convention will be the first time that most people will get to see him and hear his ideas (the media's strategy all along, as I pointed out on another blog a long time ago, has been to ignore Kerry). This will be his best opportunity to convert some of the undecided voters. He must be very effective, because he will not get this kind of exposure (barring scandal, real or manufactured) again at any point in this campaign.

      Only two polls out today: Kentucky and North Carolina.    No change in the totals, Kerry still leads  244  to  201 .    Bush maintains his lead in North Carolina, and some have pointed out that this spells trouble for Edwards since it is his home state. As I mentioned earlier, the states to worry about are the big fish -- Arizona (10 electoral votes), Florida (27), Minnesota (10), Missouri (11), Ohio (20), and Tennessee (11) . These states combined have a total of 89 votes, which are enough to give either candidate the necessary 270 votes. Ohio in the latest poll is slightly Bush (47%-44% with a 2% MoE), the others are all within the MoE.

      Vice President Dick Cheney   urlLink blasted  Kerry and Edwards today for voting to authorize the President to use force in Iraq, but voting against the $87 billion appropriation bill to fund the forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.    Having seen this Administration's track record, which mostly involves rewarding coporate benefactors at the expense of the citizens (and soldiers) of this country, I am led to wonder exactly  what  was appropriated in the $87 billion package that Kerry and Edwards voted against?    I am going to look into this issue -- my gut feeling is that it was probably nothing more than free money for Halliburton, KBR and the other scavengers making money off of the Iraq conflict, at the expense of the soldiers.

      The argument over whether or not Kerry will be strong on national defense against terrorism has the anti-Kerry people engaging in a spectacular display of 'doublethink' (defined by George Orwell as the "mental capacity to accept as equally valid two entirely contrary opinions or beliefs").    The thesis of the argument that Kerry will be weak on national security is that he will do nothing to protect America unless it is approved (or possibly even ordered) by the United Nations. As the Kerry haters point out, it was Kerry  himself  who said this:     “I’m an internationalist.  I’d like to see our troops dispersed through the world only at the directive of the United Nations.”      Of course, what they fail to mention is that Kerry made this comment to the  Harvard Crimson  in 1970 (which, as I last checked, was thirty-four years ago).    Kerry, when reminded of this by Tim Russert, stated:   "That's one of those stupid things that a 27-year-old kid says when you're fresh back from Vietnam and angry about it. I have never, ever, ever, in any vote, in any policy, in any speech, in any public statement advocated any such thing in all of the years I've been in elected office. In fact, I say the following and I say it very clearly,   I will never cede the security of the United States to any institution and I will never cede our security to any other country.    No country will have a veto over what we need to do to protect ourselves. But, that said, I will be a president who understands, as every president of the last century did, Tim, that multilaterism is not weakness, it is strength, and we need a president who understands how to reach out to other countries, build alliances." Here's where the doublethink enters into the picture. The anti-Kerry will side will use this response as another instance of Kerry "flip-flopping", yet will continue to believe that Kerry will cede national security to the UN.     However, by saying that Kerry is a "flip-flopper", they are outright admitting that Kerry will  not  cede security to the United Nations -- but they insist on continuing to promote that canard as well.    Doublethink is a very effective tool to control the masses, as Orwell pointed out.  Obviously, the Right understands this.

      New polls out for a lot of states: Florida, Louisiana, Ohio, among others.    There are two polls out for Ohio.  The CNN/Gallup poll has Kerry leading 51-45 (MoE: 5), and the Columbus Dispatch poll has Bush leading 47-44 (MoE: 2).      I'm going with the Columbus Dispatch poll solely because of the number polled -- the CNN/Gallup polled 639 "Likely" voters, while the Dispatch went with 3,047 "Registered" voters.    Kerry still leads for polls that lie outside the MoE,  244  to  201 .    In states where the polls lie 10+% points, Kerry leads  181  to  131 .    Ignoring the MoE entirely, Kerry leads  275  to  241 .

      Taking a day off after traveling all weekend for a party.    I will update the electoral vote tracking poll tomorrow (I believe some new polls came out over the weekend).    Listened to most of the Yankees-Red Sox series on crackly AM radio this weekend while driving - that must have been one heck of a series.

      A few new polls came out today: California, Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania.    For those polls where the results are outside of the margins of error, Kerry loses four electoral votes, leaving him with a  239-181  lead over Bush.    Kerry, however, has had a great jump in those polls where the candidates score 10%+ over their opponents total, jumping 89 votes to give him a  189-122  lead.    Ignoring the MoE altogether, Kerry leads  297-230 .    Kerry's 189 votes in states where he polled greater than 10% than Bush leave him needing 81 of the 118 swing votes, whereas Bush needs all 118 swing votes  plus  20 of Kerry's votes.    This election looks like it is going to boil down to the big states that are still falling within the MoE:  Arizona (10 electoral votes), Florida (27), Minnesota (10), Missouri (11), Ohio (20), and Tennessee (11).

      Today President Bush is out  urlLink courting the African-American vote.   The thesis of his address is found in this statement:   "Does the Democrat party take African-American voters for granted? It's a fair question. I know plenty of politicians assume they have your vote. But did they earn it, and do they deserve it?" Did the Democrats earn the African-American vote? Yes. They earned it during the Civil Rights movement era when they challenged the ideals of those former Democrats who had gone over to the Republican party and were fighting tooth and nail to prevent African-Americans from enjoying the rights and liberties that all white Americans enjoyed.  Do they continue to deserve the support of the African-American community? Conservatives like to espouse the idea that Liberals (aka Democrats) are engaging in "keeping the black man on the plantation" -- by driving up taxes, they are forcing African-Americans to live in poverty, thus ensuring that the Democrats will have a base of voters. This idea is pure hogwash, and is insulting to the African-American community, and ultimately it reeks of the patronizing philosophy conservative elements in this country have had toward African-Americans throughout the history of America ("they're such children, slavery actually  helps  them because they wouldn't be able to survive on their own").  This thinking is pervasive. Bush's speech to the Urban League can be boiled down to its essence -- "You don't know what's good for you. We do, so you should listen to us."  Isn't it about time we let African-Americans make their own decisions?

      According to  urlLink ESPN , union officials have told the Montreal Expos players that the decision as to where the team will be playing is near, and that it looks as if the team will be relocating to the Washington, DC area.  If they do move to DC, I hope that they change the team's name to the historical Senators (or Nationals, as they were known before that).  Although, the "Washington Expos" kind of has a ring to it.  It is the 80th anniversary of Washington's victory in the 1924 World Series.  The  urlLink Washington Post  is doing a great series on that season, I highly recommend it (on this day in history, the Nats split a doubleheader with the White Sox, leaving them 1.5 games out of first behind the Yankees and the Tigers).

      I was talking to Mrs. Slidge last night, and we both feel that the Republicans are going to win this election solely for the reason that they don't plan on losing the election at all.  We've all heard the conspiracy theories as to how this is going to happen -- postponed elections, rigged voting machines, etc.  In doing my Electoral Vote tracking poll, I began to wonder what would happen if no one candidate got a majority of the electoral vote. Well, according to Article XII of the Constitution, in that case the vote goes to the House of Representatives who then pick the President. According to Artice XII, each state gets one vote.  I looked at state representation by party and this is the quick breakdown that I found.  Republicans have majority representation in 24 states, and Democrats in 14. That leaves 12 states that do not have a recognizable majority.  A candidate would need 26 votes to become President. We can assume that Bush would start off with 24, so he would only need two of the swing states, whereas Kerry would need all 12 in order to win.   Now, this is where I begin to get a little hazy on Election Law. The House would have to decide which candidate is the winner if neither candidate gets a majority. One way that would happen is if a third candidate captures a state. I don't really see that happening.  Now, suppose a state refuses to submit their poll results to Congress in time for the votes to be counted. Say, a state like Florida with its 27 electoral votes. We could conceivably end up with a 268-243 electoral result, meaning neither candidate has majority, and on the vote goes to  Congress.  If it is obvious that Kerry is going to win Florida, could they refuse to submit the vote, hoping to try their luck getting two states to vote for their candidate in the House?  I have a feeling that this would also go to the Supreme Court, and we'd end up with another 5-4 vote.

      I have, purely for the sake of curiosity, created an Excel spreadsheet which I am using to track the various state presidential polls.     At this point, I'm really only interested in the number of electoral votes Bush or Kerry has gained in states where they have the lead  and  exceed the MoE. Keeping that in mind, I am also tracking the number of votes each candidate has in states where they exceed the opponent by 10+ percentage points, as well as a tally of votes without regard to the MoE.    I will be posting the results hopefully on a daily basis.    As of today, Kerry leads Bush  243-181 .   There are 114 votes in states where the two candidates polled within the MoE.    In states where the candidate has a 10%+ lead in the polls, Bush leads  122-98 .    If you do not take MoE into consideration, Kerry leads  262-223 , which is still shy of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election.    UPDATE:  I went in and modified the Ohio results with the Strategic Vision poll (which is a Republican polling group).  They give Ohio to Bush, which changes the results to  243-201  within the MoE.

      Some slight movement today, following the release of polls for Colorado, Nevada and Pennsylvania.  Bush lost nine EV overall, giving Kerry a  265  to  167  lead.  Kerry had some drift out of the >10% category into the 5-9% category, shifting 21 EV altogether, leaving him with 164 votes in the >10% category (a 21 point drop in the last seven days).

      Research 2000's poll of North Carolina has put that state into a statistical tie, moving 15 EV from Bush to the "at-large" pool.  Kerry now leads  265  to  161 .  This marks a 35 point drop for Bush in the last five days.  Kerry has been at 265 EV for eleven consecutive days now.

      ARG's poll for Ohio came out today, and the race is a statistical tie. Bush had been leading outside of the MoE in Ohio, so this takes Ohio's 20 EV out of his total and into the kitty, giving Kerry a  265  to  176  lead over Bush.  Bush was last at 176 EV on 8/2.  Kerry has remained at 265 EV since 8/5.  There are still 97 EV at large -- Bush needs 94 of them to have the majority.  It will be interesting to track the totals after the GOP Convention, to see if Bush will have the same bounce that Kerry did.

      The SBVT have made several claims about Kerry, including that he lied about his wounds he received to win his Purple Hearts, that he lied about enemy combat when he won his Bronze Star, that he lied about killing an innocent VC to win his Silver Star, and that he lied about being in Cambodia on Christmas Eve, 1968.  Kerry received his first Purple Heart following a firefight on 12/2/68, for a shrapnel wound in the arm.  According to SBVT veteran Louis Letson, "I know John Kerry is lying about his first purple heart, because I treated him for that injury."  Kerry's commander, SBVT veteran Cmdr Grant Hibbard, said that the next day, Kerry arrived at his office and nominated himself for the Purple Heart.  Hibbard says that he told Kerry to "forget it", because the wound was just a scratch on his forearm.   Letson is outright lying about this incident, as the official military record shows that he did not treat Kerry (in fact, he did not even serve with Kerry). According to the official record, Kerry had shrapnel removed from above the elbow.  This also contradicts Hibbard's statement that the wound was a slight scratch on the forearm.  Also, a soldier cannot nominate themself for a Purple Heart.  This can only be done by the commanding officer, in this case, Cmdr Hibbard, who later recounted, "I do remember some questions on it. . .I finally said, OK if that's what happened. . . do whatever you want."  Kerry was awarded the Purple Heart three months later, after he transferred to Coastal Division 11.  The SBVT claim that Kerry also lied on another ocassion to win a Purple Heart.  SBVT veteran Larry Thurlow, another Swift Boat commander, alleges that Kerry received a Purple Heart for wounds Kerry received in the butt while trying to blow up a rice supply with a hand grenade.  This statement is misleading, as according to the official record, Kerry received the Purple Heart for wounds received in his arm followin a mine explosion.  The record states that he also had shrapnel in his butt from the early grenade explosion, but the Purple Heart was not awarded for that, it was awarded for the arm wound received in the mine explosion.  Several SBVT veterans have come forth to say that Kerry was lying about enemy fire in the incident when he won his Bronze Star.  These SBVT veterans include Van O'Dell, Jack Chenowith, and Larry Thurlow.  These men did not serve on Kerry's boat.  There are several eyewitnesses aboard Kerry's boat that refute their claims.  The first is Jim Rassman, who was rescued by Kerry.  He claims that reports that there was no enemy fire is "a pure fabrication...the fire was strong enough to knock out Tommy Belodeau's machine gun...I was in the middle of the firefight."  Rassman also relays, "While returning from a SEA LORDS operation along the Bay Hap River, a mine detonated under another swift boat. Machine-gun fire erupted from both banks of the river, and a second explosion followed moments later. The second blast blew me off John's swift boat, PCF-94, throwing me into the river. Fearing that the other boats would run me over, I swam to the bottom of the river and stayed there as long as I could hold my breath.  When I surfaced, all the swift boats had left, and I was alone taking fire from both banks. To avoid the incoming fire, I repeatedly swam under water as long as I could hold my breath, attempting to make it to the north bank of the river. I thought I would die right there. The odds were against me avoiding the incoming fire and, even if I made it out of the river, I thought I'd be captured and executed. Kerry must have seen me in the water and directed his driver, Del Sandusky, to turn the boat around. Kerry's boat ran up to me in the water, bow on, and I was able to climb up a cargo net to the lip of the deck. But, because I was nearly upside down, I couldn't make it over the edge of the deck. This left me hanging out in the open, a perfect target. John, already wounded by the explosion that threw me off his boat, came out onto the bow, exposing himself to the fire directed at us from the jungle, and pulled me aboard."  The pilot on PCF-94, Del Sandusky, also refutes the SBVT claim by saying, "It was a hellacious firefight, I don't know how these guys could stretch the truth like this."  It's not just the testimony of those on Kerry's boat that casts a huge shadow of credibility on O'Dell, Chenowith and Thurlow.  According to the official record, submitted by Elliott, "BOATS RECEIVED HEAVY A/W [automatic weapons] & S/A [small arms] FROM BOTH BANKS…ALL BOATS AND MSF RETURNED FIRE…PCF-94 [Kerry's boat] PICKED UP MSF ADVISOR WHO WENT OVERBOARD…PCF-94 TOWED PCF-3 [Chenowith's boat]"  O'Dell and Chenowith had been on PCF-3, which according to Thurlow's recollection, "was in shambles but they were still shooting too hard to assess any damage."  Furthermore, Thurlow himself won a Bronze Star in this encounter, for actions under enemy fire.  Elliott, the commanding officer, puts it best.  Although he now says that Kerry did not deserve the Bronze Star because he lied about enemy combat, he said previously, "I simply have no reason for these guys to be lying, and if they are lying in concert, it is one hell of a conspiracy. So, on the basis of all of the information that has come out, I have chosen to believe the other men. I absolutely do not know first hand."  In other words, in order for Kerry to have won the Bronze Star even though there was no enemy fire, Kerry and the crew of his boat had to lie about the incident, Chenowith and the crew of his boat had to lie about the incident, Thurlow and the crew of his boat had to lie about the incident, and Rassman had to lie about the incident, when they all made their initial reports to Elliott.  Another allegation that the SBVT has put forth was that Kerry lied about the events surrounding his Silver Star, and that he shot an unarmed VC in the back.  This is the subject of some controversy, because the person who submitted Kerry's name for the Silver Star recanted his original SBVT testimony ("I still don't think he shot the guy in the back.  It was a terrible mistake probably for me to sign the affidavit with those words. I'm the one in trouble here."), and then modified his original allegation by saying that he had never received a report that Kerry had shot an unarmed VC, and if had received such a report, he would not have submitted his name ("in connection with his Silver Star, I was never informed that he had simply shot a wounded, fleeing Viet Cong in the back").   Elliott, of course, has contradicted himself on this very issue prior to this, as he said in 1996, "The fact that he chased an armed enemy down is not something not to be looked down upon but it was an act of courage. And the whole outfit served with honor..."[T]here was no question that it was above and beyond anything that we had seen down there in that case at that time frame...It just so happened that this one was so outstanding that the Silver Star was eventually awarded."  So, Elliott first said that Kerry shot an armed VC, then said Kerry had shot an unarmed VC, recanted that statement, and finally ended up with, "Nobody ever told me that Kerry shot an unarmed VC."  Regardless, all of that is immaterial, since the Silver Star was not awarded for the killing of the VC, but rather for Kerry leading two counterattacks against ambushes against the Swift Boats (the killing of the VC happened during one of the counterattacks).  From Kerry's Silver Star citation, "Unhesitatingly, Lieutenant (junior grade) Kerry ordered his boat to attack as all units opened fire and beached directly in front of the enemy ambushers. This daring and courageous tactic surprised the enemy and succeeded in routing a score of enemy soldiers." It says "many enemy weapons" were captured. Later, 800 yards away, Kerry's boat encountered a second ambush and a B-40 rocket exploded  "close aboard" Kerry's boat. "With utter disregard for his own safety, and the enemy rockets, he again ordered a charge on the enemy, beached his boat only ten feet away from the VC rocket position, and personally led a landing party ashore in pursuit of the enemy." Kerry was cited for "extraordinary daring and personal courage . . . in attacking a numerically superior force in the face of intense fire."  And Elliott himself defended Kerry on this very issue in 1996, when he said that Kerry acted properly and deserved the Silver Star.  Even as recent as June, 2003, Elliott called Kerry's Silver Star "well deserved" and his action "courageous" for beaching his boat in the face of an ambush.  Lastly, Elliott also said, "I ended up writing it up for a Silver Star, which is well deserved, and I have no regrets or second thoughts at all about that. . .. (It) was pretty courageous to turn into an ambush even though you usually find no more than two or three people there."  An interesting claim that SBVT makes is that Kerry lied about being in Cambodia Christmas Eve 1968.  Kerry has made several references to that, including in his own journal for Christmas Eve, 1968.  This is a very hard allegation to deny, since there is no official record of this happening, since the US to this day claims that they never went into Cambodia, but thousands of soldiers report otherwise.  Kerry claims to have a hat that was given to him by a CIA operative he shipped into Cambodia.  This is an example of forcing Kerry to prove a negative, which is logically impossible.  Other SBVT veterans (who did not actually serve with Kerry) have claimed that Kerry ran away from combat.  This is debunked in his fitness reports and by eyewitness testimony of his crew:  "In a combat environment often requiring independent, decisive action LTJG Kerry was unsurpassed. He constantly reviewed tactics and lessons learned in river operations and applied his experience at every opportunity. On one occasion while in tactical command of a three boat operation his units were taken under fire from ambush. LTJG Kerry rapidly assessed the situation and ordered his units to turn directly into the ambush. This decision resulted in routing the attackers with several enemy KIA.  LTJG Kerry emerges as the acknowledged leader in his peer group. His bearing and appearance are above reproach. He has of his own volition learned the Vietnamese language and is instrumental in the successful Vietnamese training program. During the period of this report LTJG Kerry has been awarded the Silver Star medal, the Bronze Star medal, the Purple Heart medal (2nd and 3rd awards)." -- George Elliotts fitness report of Kerry, 12/18/69  Gunners Mate Fred Short put it succintly, "I've seen his mettle in action. I know he's a cool character under fire."  So, who are these SBVT, who want to expose the "truth" of what Kerry was doing.  They are an interesting hybrid of Republican operatives, and veterans who are angry at Kerry for embracing the anti-war movement following his service in Vietnam.  They both have a huge axe to grind -- the Republicans because they don't want John Kerry and the Democrats to win the presidential election, and the veterans because they are angered at Kerry's twin betrayal of adopting the anti-war movement, and normalizing relations with Vietnam along with John McCain (another subject of their attacks).  The most interesting thing about the veterans is that they cannot keep their stories straight.  Most of them, during Vietnam (and prior to Kerry becoming anti-war), had high regard for his service (as can be seen in Elliott's fitness reports).  Adrian Lonsdale, who said, "I don't like what he said after the war.  But he was a good naval officer", sums it up nicely.  Lonsdale, who also said, ""As far as I was concerned, the war was won over there in that part for that period. And it was mainly won because of the bravado and the courage of the young officers that ran the boats, the SWIFT boats and the Coast Guard cutters and Senator Kerry was no exception. He was among the finest of those" in 1996, is among many of the SBVT to "flip-flop" their position on Kerry.  Now he says, "...he lacks the capacity to lead."  Admiral Hoffman is another SBVT who has made many critical remarks about Kerry's service, but now "acknowledge[s] he had no first-hand knowledge to discredit Kerry's claims to valor and said that although Kerry was under his command, he really didn't know Kerry much personally."  The two big stars of the SBVT right now are John O'Neil and Jim Corsi, who have co-written teh book "Unfit for Command".  O'Neil was handpicked by Nixon's hatchetman Chuck Colson in 1972 to "take down" the anti-war activist John Kerry.  O'Neil has claimed to have served with Kerry, but he did not even arrive in Vietnam until two months after Kerry left Vietnam.  Although he did not serve with Kerry, he still has made statements like, "I saw some war heroes ... John Kerry is not a war hero...He couldn't tie the shoes of some of the people in Coastal Division 11."  O'Neil is an interesting conglomeration of both the Republican side of the SBVT, and the anti-Kerry veteran side of SBVT.  O'Neil is a partner in the same law firm with Tex Lezar, who ran for Lt. Gov. with GW Bush in 1994.  Another partner served as GW Bush's General Counsel.  The other co-author of "Unfit for Command" is Jim Corsi.  Corsi's credibility as an objective participant has been destroyed by the unearthing of statements he made on the website FreeRepublic, including:  # Corsi on Islam: "a worthless, dangerous Satanic religion"  # Corsi on Catholicism: "Boy buggering in both Islam and Catholicism is okay with the Pope as long as it isn't reported by the liberal press"  # Corsi on Muslims: "RAGHEADS are Boy-Bumpers as clearly as they are Women-Haters -- it all goes together"  # Corsi on "John F*ing Commie Kerry": "After he married TerRAHsa, didn't John Kerry begin practicing Judiasm? He also has paternal grandparents that were Jewish. What religion is John Kerry?"  # Corsi on Senator "FAT HOG" Clinton: "Anybody ask why HELLary couldn't keep BJ Bill satisfied? Not lesbo or anything, is she?"  The GOP arm of SBVT includes Merrie Spaeth, who assisted in the organization of the group.  Her late husband was Tex Lezar, who was a partner of John O'Neil.  According to the IRS, the groups biggest funders are Bob J. Perry and the Crow family.  Bob J. Perry has donated over $5 million in the last four years to GOP and conservative causes.  Harlan Crow is a trustee of the GHW Bush Pres Library Foundation.  Other Swift Boat Vets include Andy Horne (protoge of former Republican Senator Phil Gramm), and Bill Lannom (whose own mother says their antagonism toward Democrats dates back to FDR).  The IRS reports payments from the SWVT to Robert Hahn, operator of the Free Republic Network, and Tom Wyld, director of PR for the NRA's lobbying arm, and their website run by William Franke, a St. Louis businessman with ties to Ashcroft and the Missouri GOP.

      Two polls out today, for Oklahoma and Michigan.  No change in the overall numbers, Kerry still leads Bush  265  to  196 .  There was a slight change as Kerry's numbers are slowly drifting away from the ">10%" column and into the "5-9%" column.  The next wave of polls should be interesting, as it will encompass the end of Kerry's bounce from the convention and the beginning of the post-convention era as the two candidates begin to actively campaign against each other.

      Here are two charts that show some interesting trends.  The first is the graph of Bush's approval ratings mapped over the raising of the terrorist threat levels. As can be seen, whenever Bush's ratings take a downward turn, the threat level gets raised and Bush gets a little bump:   urlLink     And in this graph, we see how Bush's approval ratings have been somewhat similar to the rise and fall of gasoline prices:   urlLink     I have posted these without permission, I certainly hope  urlLink PollKatz  and  urlLink JuliusBlog  don't mind.

      The GOP desperation grows.  Now they have their own  urlLink "documentary"  which apparently details Kerry's "flip flop" on Iraq.  Oddly enough, to me it shows that Kerry was mostly concerned about the lack of inspections in Iraq more than anything.  And it clearly shows the result of the Bush Administration's campaign of misrepresentation and distortions of the truth.  Kerry was in favor of the war, as we all know, because the Bush Admin gave our represenatives a ton of bogus information.  He then voted against the $87 billion proposal (the same proposal that Bush had threatened to  veto ) because it did not contain enough funding to adequately stabilize Iraq after combat operations were over.  Of course, this is not just a 527 that is pushing this video of quotes taken out of context:  Republican National Committee (YEMVZQVNHD)    310 First Street SE    Washington, DC 20003    US  Domain Name: KERRYONIRAQ.COM  They are  real  desperate now.

      As I suspected, the 7/26 FD Public Mind poll of New Jersey was most likely an outlier.  That poll had made New Jersey a close race, with Kerry having a 2-point lead over Bush.  Today, Quinnipiac released their New Jersey poll, giving Kerry a 49-36 point lead with MoE of 3.5.  That gives New Jersey's 15 electoral votes to Kerry, and brings his lead to  265  to  196 .  That leaves Kerry five votes shy of the necessary 270 to win.   As I mentioned in the previous post, the idea that Kerry received no "bounce" is odd, seeing as how since the convention he has gone up 36 votes while Bush remains at 196.  I certainly would consider a 15% improvement to be a "bounce".  The other thing to notice is those fifteen votes from New Jersey go into the "leads state poll by 10%+" category, or what I view to be "committed" states.   In these state polls, Kerry leads 189 to 131.

      I've been thinking about the raising of the terror threat based upon the information found in Pakistan, and while I agree that the timing of it is suspicious, I think everyone is missing the major fundamental problem with our homeland security.  The perceived problem, as I see it, is that the Administration is lying once again. This is because the information was presented as "new", when it was in fact information gathered by al Qaeda prior to 9/11. Given the track record of the Administration, it is easy to assume that they gave out this "new" information in order to scare American voters.  I don't think that this is the  real  problem.  To the Administration, this three year old information  is   new.   In other words, al Qaeda was planning attacks  three years  ago, and we are just now finding the evidence of those attacks (the initial surveillances of financial centers, etc.)  Al Qaeda can do a lot in three years, which was just short of the time it took to plan and execute 9/11. If we are just stumbling upon the planning stages (and I use the term "we" loosely, since apparently it's Pakistan that is doing the legwork that the Bush Adminstration keeps taking credit for), God knows what else al Qaeda has been planning, or how close they are to execution of any attacks.  The Administration has focused so much of its efforts in the wrong direction (just as they did prior to 9/11) that they are failing us in the "war against terrorism".  We need to end this war against a word ("terrorism"), and begin fighting a war against actual terrorists ("al Qaeda"). Until we do that, we are in  real  danger.

      No "bounce" for Kerry?  Well, if you ignore that Kerry now leads Florida outside of the MoE (according to Zogby), yeah, there's no "bounce".  Zogby released new battlefield state polls today, and in those polls outside of the MoE, Kerry leads  250  to  196 .  Actually, there really is no "bounce", since both candidates went up (Kerry went up 12, Bush went up 20), but Zogby predicted that any bounce would be slight -- "Only a slim margin of voters is undecided so the conventions aren't likely to cause major swings of support." He also predicts that Bush will see little to no "bounce" after his convention.  Kerry's support in states where he polls >10% higher than Bush has been eroding steadily over the last two weeks (he had 189 EV in this category on 7/23, but today is down to 153), while Bush has been fairly steady in that category (no change from his 131 EV in the last week and a half).  The middle category (polls where a candidate outpolls the other between 5% and 9%) has been relatively stable (although Bush's margin in those polls has gone from +9 EV to +2 EV).  In those polls where the difference is  less than 5%, Kerry has had a    huge  jump. On 7/23, Kerry led Bush 58 EV to 49 EV -- today he leads 115 EV to 11 EV. Keep in mind, however, that almost all of these polls (if not all) lie  within  the MoE.

      There is a debate raging right now about whether the Bush Administration is using "terrorist threats" in order to intimidate the American voters into supporting President Bush over the challenger, John Kerry.  In his press conference announcing that DHS was raising the terrorist alert level, Tom Ridge said:  "This afternoon we do have new and unusually specific information about where al-Qaida would like to attack." Specifically:  "Reports indicate that al-Qaida is targeting several specific buildings, including the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in the District of Columbia, Prudential Financial in northern New Jersey, and Citigroup buildings and the New York Stock Exchange in New York." Certainly, this was done in the interest of American safety, correct? Certainly, the Department of Homeland Security would not be calling a press conference in order to point out that President Bush is tougher on terrorism than John Kerry?  "But we must understand that the kind of information available to us today is the result of the president's leadership in the war against terror." That certainly doesn't prove that this is all smoke and mirrors intended to promote Bush as the better candidate against terror, especially with the  new  and  unusually specific  intelligence about a terrorist attack against US financial services.  The  urlLink Washington Post  casts some doubt, however, to the "newness" of the information:  "Most of the al Qaeda surveillance of five financial institutions that led to a new terrorism alert Sunday was conducted before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and authorities are not sure whether the casing of the buildings has continued, numerous intelligence and law enforcement officials said yesterday.   More than half a dozen government officials interviewed yesterday, who declined to be identified because classified information is involved, said that most, if not all, of the information about the buildings seized by authorities in a raid in Pakistan last week was about three years old, and possibly older." Another classic bungling by the Bush Administration. In an attempt to showcase how strong the President is against terror, he actually showcased that we are at least  three years  behind the curve.

      In polls outside of the MoE, Kerry still leads  238  to  176 .  This makes a -1 vote change overall for Kerry since 7/23, and a +9 increase since last Friday.  Bush has lost -5 votes since 7/23, and has changed -20 votes since last Friday.  Yet, everyone still says that there is no "bounce" for Kerry. I don't know, but adding 29 points over a weekend is indicative of something.  In polls where one candidate outpolls the other by +10%, Kerry leads  153  to  131 .  Big drop here for Kerry since 7/23.  He has lost -46 votes, although its a -21 vote change since last Friday.  Bush, on the other hand, has picked up +9 votes since 7/23, and his vote totals are unchanged since last Friday.  So, in states where it appears that they are committed to a candidate, Kerry has made up some ground (+25 points) over the last two weeks, while Bush remains at the same spot he was on July 23 (and Kerry has nearly halved Bush's +55 vote jump on 7/23).  In polls ignoring the MoE, Kerry leads  279  to  229 .  Kerry has dropped -18 votes since 7/23, but only -1 vote since Friday.  Bush had an overall -1 vote change since 7/23, and no change at all since Friday.  So, since last Friday, Kerry has picked up 17 votes inside of the MoE.  It looks like Kerry was polling very well up to 7/23, and then dropped a bit in the following week, and is slowly making the ground back up. Whether this constitutes no "bounce" is up in the air until some more polls roll in (there has not been a lot of polling data  since  Kerry's acceptance speech).

      The Democratic National convention is over, and John Kerry has won the party's nomination to run for President of the United States.  In his acceptance speech, he layed out his positive vision of the direction America should be going in, and why he is the man for the job.  And what is the Bush campaign response to this?  Are they going to outline their own positive vision of America's future?  Are they examining the core issues and values at hand and establishing their policies and agenda?  No.  Instead, they are going to  urlLink make fun of John Kerry .  I once made a comment that the Bush Administration's position on Iraq was akin to a bully beating up a developmentally disabled child, and then getting caught.  The bully will make up story after story, excuse after excuse, until ultimately ending up with some inane justification, like "He made me beat him up!"  Meanwhile, all of the bully's defenders have long since shook their head and walked off in disgust.  This is along those lines.  I am reminded of a middle school class president election, where the bully's strategy is to make fun of his opponent.   It usually starts off with cutting comments about the opponent's clothes or hairstyle, and ultimately ends up with ridiculous claims -- "He likes to sniff other people's butts in the locker room!"

      I was doing a little research into Gus Triandos, and I came across this blockbuster trade that went down on 11/18/1954 between the Orioles (who had just finished their first season since moving from St. Louis) and the New York Yankees.  The Orioles traded Bob Turley, Don Larsen (who pitched a perfect game for the Yankees in the 1956 World Series), Billy Hunter, Mike Blyzka, Darrell Johnson, Jim Fridley and Dick Kryhoski for Gus Triandos, Willy Miranda, Gene Woodling, Harry Byrd, Jim McDonald, Hal Smith, Bill Miller, Kal Segrist, Don Leppert and Ted del Guercio.  This was an important trade because it brought a lot of new blood into the Orioles franchise and helped the team to establish its own identity.

      The  urlLink Washington Post  has an editorial about baseball in Washington.  The thesis of their argument is this:  "...the San Francisco Giants, playing in a glamorous new stadium, are on a pace to draw 3.2 million fans this year. Meanwhile, the Oakland Athletics, in an old stadium not well suited to baseball, can expect to bring in more than 2 million for home games. And keep in mind that these two stadiums are only about 17 miles apart, not 35 or 40 or whatever distance would separate a Washington area team from the Baltimore Orioles." Of course, they also mention that both teams are playing  good  baseball, which really isn't true of both the Orioles or the Expos.
