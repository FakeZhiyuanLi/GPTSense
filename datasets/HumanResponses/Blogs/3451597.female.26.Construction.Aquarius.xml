      Ok...So all is well I won't have to use this time to go on an American Idol rampage. But seriously, I am so happy that Fantasia won. I've been on her side since the very first time I saw her in the audition process. She deserves every opportunity that comes her way --she earned it!  Well I am heading to Miami tonight for a long weekend. YEA!! I've never been so this should be fun. My friend from college, LJ has been down there for a week for a conference. We'll be staying through Monday. I really wanted to go to Miami during my week of vacation that I took in March, but it didn't work out then. Needless to say, I'm really excited about this. Another one of my friends, SS from high school will be coming down on Saturday. It should be a good time.  I haven't been on a plane since high school (at least 8 years) so I'm kinda anxious about that. With all the new security measures in place since I last flew, not knowing what to expect can be a little bit much. Plus just the general idea of flying is not really something I like to think about too much. I don't know if I can say I'm officially scared to fly, but if there were an equally time efficient alternative way to get down there, I think I'd go for it. I mean, if something goes wrong up there...well you don't have too many options as a passenger. Let's not even talk about the motion sickness! Ok...let me get off that subject.  I'm sitting here at work, just trying to pass the time with hopes that the day will move quickly. I have the most amazing set up...I pretty much get paid to sit at a desk and do next to nothing. I am an office manager...but NO ONE ever comes in the office --ever! No one comes, no one calls, no one cares. I'm just here  in case   anyone ever does need me to do anything. It's really weird. I am in the office alone  a lot . The only other person who ever comes in is the Construction Manager, TH. If it weren't for TH, I'd never see another human being during my 8 hour day. He's really cool and we have a nice time talking when he comes. For the most part, he's outside on site or on another project so his time here is limited.  Most of the time I spend my days surfing the web...until my eyes hurt. Ok...so sometimes I do actually do things, but it never lasts long. I may have a project to work on and once it's finished, the next one is far off.   Some may say this is great (which it is on days when I'm tired), but a lot of the time, it's boring. I'm not being challenged, not utilizing my talent, and not really learning much. I'm certainly getting restless. The position is only guaranteed through the end of the year and then I may have to move on. I think by then I will be ready to  really  do something. I will miss the convenient location and minimal duties at times I'm sure, but I have to grow sometime.

      I just want to go on record as saying that if Fantasia Barrino doesn't become the new American Idol tonight, I will be fired up. I mean what else does this girl have to do to prove that she is a star and was born to do this? Yes, I realize that she doesn't   need   this competition to succeed, but it's just the principle. She's been consistent each week and on last night's final performance show, she KILLED Diana! While Diana was busy putting on her pageant performance and singing off key in the process, Fantasia was reinventing old songs and taking new ones to unanticipated heights. Did she and Diana  really  sing the same song because it sure didn't sound like it! I can't wait for that girl's album to drop...I'll be the first in line.   For those of you who don't like American Idol: You should be glad that I didn't start this blog until the last week of the show. I can get pretty worked up over it. :-)

      Well after years of being intrigued by other people's lives I figured it was time to start talking about mine. I am shorty mellow and I'm a 26 year old female living in Maryland. I'm a college grad with a degree in Mass Communication(which I'm not using at all.) Of course this fact and many others prove to be a point of frustration for me...but we'll get into that later.  My passion is MUSIC. I love singing and I also write songs. If I could do anything I wanted to do...it would be writing songs all day, and going on tour singing background for somebody.  I seem to be one of those people who is blessed with meeting all the right people, but for whatever reasons, I don't capitalize on the opportunity. I've been surrounded by talented producers, major (free!) studios, and great musicians...so why hasn't this thing jumped off for me yet? Well, I did have one song placed on a major project..a grammy-winning gospel group. But to be honest, that whole thing is a sore spot too...after a re-write of MY idea, getting a small percentage of the song and not getting paid on top of that, I'm not so excited about that or that group any more.   It's occurring to me more and more that I seem to be the hold up in all of these situations. I think FEAR is the dominant factor in all of this. Fear of what? Failure? Success? I'm not sure. The fact that I try to push my singing on the back burner is another hindering factor. I know I can sing...well at that, but I just get extremely nervous in front of people. Nervousness leads to it not coming out the way I planned or wanted it to. I feel like if I'm not gonna do it right, don't do it at all --but of course that's no way to get over stage fright. So that leaves me here ---a talented writer and singer who's best performances are reserved for the privacy of her own home. I'm working on it though.  I've also recently bought a guitar. I think that this will help me along with my writing and provide some funny stories as I learn.  Well I suppose that's enough sharing for now...good to be here.

      I watched this last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. I always thought Pac was a very interesting and insightful dude, and this just confirmed it even more. If you have even a remote interest in Tupac, you should definitely check this movie out. I did not watch the special features yet, but I am anxious to hear more from him. It's just sad that we lost him so soon. I think I'll have to break out  Me Against The World  today.

      The rude incident from yesterday morning(plus one more in the afternoon)really threw me off and I didn't talk about the nice weekend I had. I spent some good quality time with my sweetie. He got off of work early on Friday, so he stopped by my office around lunchtime and ended up staying until I got off. We left and went to my house and chilled for a while. We listened to music, a old tape of me rapping at my family reunion (don't ask), and generally acted silly.  We left my house and grabbed some food from this fast food Italian spot and went back to his house to eat. We watched  Mystic River  while eating. I liked it. We pretty much just watched T.V. and played around the rest of the night (I had planned to stay over Friday and Saturday nights).  On Saturday there was more chilling involved. We woke up, he went to the grocery store and then made pancakes. We relaxed for a few hours and then I went by my house to check the mail and grab a video tape. On the way back in, I picked up Chinese food for dinner. We ate and chilled and watched T.V. You will notice that we do a lot of "chillin', acting silly, and watching T.V."   On Sunday I got up and went to the grocery store to get some things for lunch this week. I came back and we...chilled and watched T.V.!! lol During the course of the day I ended up taking a little nap. Later that evening we went to 7-11 for some dessert before I went home. I came back home around 8 and got ready for Monday.  We didn't go out to dinner and a movie as planned, but we both enjoyed ourselves anyway. It's good when you enjoy someone's company so much that you don't mind being in the house all weekend together. I think I caught a good one. :-)

      People really get on my nerves. Not all people --just the ones I seem to come across. This work environment is really getting on my nerves! Since I seem to find myself alone the majority of the time, and my office is in the cut, people seem to forget that I exist. Therefore by the time I left work Friday I discovered that a steel fence has been put up blocking the public from coming into a restricted area --and me from leaving my own office. I ended up having to cut through the construction site (a big no-no) in order to leave. The guys gave me a hard time, which really annoyed me because they thought I was just some random pedestrian wandering onto the construction site. But there was no other way to exit AND I work there too!! What I was going to do on Monday crossed my mind, but I just figured I'd deal with it then.   So I come in to work this morning and head straight for the "guy in charge" at the construction site. Me: With this new fence up there is no way for me to get into the office.  Him: yeah *while shrugging shoulders* Me: *waiting for some sort of answer/option*  Him: *blank stare*  Me: *After realizing that  was  his answer* So...how am I supposed to get in?  Him: Uh...you can cut through here. That's probably the way you have to go because that fence will be up there for a while. Me: Yeah, I had to go out this way Friday, but--  Him: Yeah you can just go this way   He cut me off before I could tell him that someone gave me a hard time for walking through the construction site on Friday. So I'm sure he thinks I'm stupid for asking, when that is obviously the  only  way to go. He already rubbed me the wrong way, but fortunately I've never really had to deal with him. We see each other and say hello and that's it. I've never had to ask him for anything. Since I did ask, believe me, I really needed his help. So don't stand there and look at me like "What are you asking ME for?" or looking like I'm speaking in some foreign language that you've never heard before. You do work here don't you? Is it too much to take out a few moments of your freakin' day to help me get into my own damn office?   Apparently it is.

      The weekend definitely went by too fast for me. The weather wasn't all that great either. I'm just counting down until the week is over yet again. *sigh*  I watched 2 movies over the course of the weekend.  Nora's Hair Salon  and  Monster .  Nora's Hair Salon  was actually a lot better than expected. I really just got it out of curiosity and a lack of TV programming to watch that night.  Monster  was really good. Charlize Theron really got into that part. She was totally unrecognizable and showed her true acting chops.  Nothing much else went on this weekend....watched movies, spent some quality time with my boyfriend, and went to church. It was a good weekend, but too short. Next weekend my boyfriend and I are planning dinner and a movie. The thought of that will help me get through the week. :-)

      All I really want to do today at work is...nothing. I am just counting down the hours 'til I can go home and relax. There is a good chance that I'll actually have to do some "real" work today. I really don't feel like going out on site and walking through every floor and stairwell in a 7 tier parking facility, looking at every nook and cranny and noting things that need to be fixed. Of all the days for me to be out on site creating a punchlist, this is the worst one possible. Plus, the hardhat is not going to fit over today's hairstyle. LOL

      I just came back from Miami yesterday and I already want to go back. I was scheduled to leave from BWI on Thursday around 7pm. I left work around 2, did some last minute shopping, and came home. I was done packing so I just sat at home waiting to leave. Now I haven't flown since high school which was way before all this new airport security, so I didn't really know what to expect. I also didn't know that I shouldn't be sitting at home chilling 'til 5:00 waiting to leave for the airport. Originally, a friend SS who travels often was going to drop me off at the airport. She said she'd pick me up at 5:00. Once I decided to go ahead and drive myself, I just stuck with 5 because I thought my friend was in the know. So I actually left my house before 5 to get on my way.    I get out on 95 and of course there's crazy rush hour traffic. I get a little worried that I may not make it. No, I convince myself, you  will  make it! I get into the aiport area and tune in to their radio station. I find out just which parking lot is full so I can make my way to the empty one. I park, get my bags and go to the airport shuttle bus stop. I make it onto the first bus that comes and by this time it's about 6:15. The bus stops and stops AND STOPS (as it should...but I was blown anyway) and finally we arrive at my terminal.   I go in and stand in line for about a minute when I realize I can check myself in by computer. So I go over to the self check in, swipe my credit card input the necessary info and wait for my boarding pass to print. Wait...Error Message "We can not process your request. Please see agent for assistance" Ok...at the same moment the man next to me has the same problem. We alert the ticket agent and she jumps right on it. She looks up our info and says that check-in ends 30 mins before departure. By the time I stepped over to the self check-in, I was about a minute late! The agent tried to override the system and manually check us in, but no go. We have missed the flight. "No you haven't missed your flight", I convince myself, "you are getting on this flight!" She looks up the next available flight and says that she can put us on standby for that flight. Since it's a holiday weekend, our chances of making it on that flight are smaller.   A group of guys come up behind us trying to check into the same flight. The man next to me tells them that they have missed it. The ticket agent tells us the time of our standby flight. 6am....6am? You mean as in TOMORROW? NooooooOOOOOOO!!! So we accept the standby tickets and all disperse to different ticket counters to try our luck at landing another (cheap) flight for tonight...no luck.  I finally ascend out of the depths of denial and realize that I am in fact NOT going to make it to Miami tonight. I also try to grasp the concept of not making it at all since it's a very busy travel weekend. A ray of hope did come from the ticket agent at Southwest airlines. She tipped me off that many people miss that first flight out in the morning because it's so early. My chances are good that several seats will be available. My ticket counter (American)opens at 4am. I have to be there then. I checked into the Red Roof Inn very close to the airport for the night. There's no way I'm going back home and risking missing it again. I didn't even move my car because I didn't want to deal with that god forsaken airport shuttle either. The hotel van will be leaving at 4am for the hotel and you better believe I'll be on it.   I suppose the fear of missing my flight grabbed me because I didn't sleep well at all that night. I got in the bed around 10:30 and slept lightly for 2 hours. By the time 12:30am hit, I was WIDE awake. I watched TV for a few hours, roamed down to the vending machines and waited for 4:00 to arrive. Around 3:40am I go down and check out and load my bags into the van. To my surprise the van was full of other travelers. Long story short, I made it on my flight. I arrived in Miami around 8:30am and the airport already looked like a party.  When my friend LJ and I first decided to do this, we didn't know that Memorial Day weekend in South Beach was HUGE for black folks. It was basically an all Hip Hop weekend packed full of parties, pool parties, basketball tournaments, concerts, club events etc. I've heard it referred to as the "new Freaknic". Well we didn't know, but it sure looked like everyone else did. Girls were decked out in their best club gear at 8:30 am!! Heels, short skirts, tight pants, and hair in place. They weren't playing. The fellas just enjoyed taking all the sights in. The funny thing was that I knew the view would only get worse as the weekend went on.  My first celebrity sighting was as soon as I arrived at the airport. Biz Markie was standing around waiting for his bags I guess. Nobody seemed to notice him, or really care. He was standing in the middle of everything not being bothered at all.   Now my friend LJ, had been in Miami all week for business. She had the company paid hotel room at the Deauville Beach Resort through Saturday morning and then we'd move on to the Doubletree in Coconut Grove. I caught the Super Shuttle to the hotel and on the way the driver informed us that where we were staying was far from the action this weekend. I was quite fine with that because I had the feeling I'd be avoiding "the action" most of the weekend. I like to have fun, but females parading around half-naked and guys drooling, gawking, cat calling, and taking pictures and video of them was not my idea of it.  LJ was on her last conference-related outing and had left me a key at the front desk. I went to the room for a minute and then took a stroll to see what the surrounding area was like. On my walk I bought some flip flops and enjoyed my new surroundings. I also passed by an interesting character who informed me that "evil father god was the reason I was born" and told me on the way back that I "could have a penis but evil father god probably doesn't want me to" Thanks lady, I'll keep that in mind.  I went back to the hotel and changed into my beach gear. I went out to the BEAUTIFUL beach and got some sun. I could not believe that I was actually out there on the most beautiful beach I've ever seen --chilling. The water was a beautiful aqua and I was sitting on white sand. I got in the water for a few minutes, but mostly just chilled and listened to my iPod.  I came back to the room and the lack of sleep from the previous week and night caught up to me. I got in the bed around 2pm and didn't get up until LJ came back after 6pm. I literally had to make myself get up out of that bed because I had fallen into a deep state of rest where I could be awake and talking to LJ one minute and then sleep by the time she went to the ice machine and came back. I did manage to get up long enough for us to go to this Cuban restaurant down the street and grab a bite to eat. Delicious!! We walked around a little and then came back to the room to figure out what we were going to do that night. After a while I could feel myself drifting again. The next thing I knew, it was morning.  We got up and decided that we'd get dressed and make our move to the new hotel. We would figure out what we were going to eat once we got there. We packed up and caught a cab over to the Doubletree. We were able to check in early and got a really nice room. The room was handicapped and it worked out nicely because it was very spacious. We decided to take a walk around Coconut Grove to see what was around. We walked to the stores in the area and ended up at Cocowalk. Cocowalk is and area packed with restaurants (ie Cheesecake Factory, Fat Tuesdays and Hooters) and stores. We ended up eating at this Spanish place. My salad with shrimp was just o.k.  We bought jewelry at Out of Africa and several things at the Gap where I had my second celeb sighting. I'm busy looking at the racks when LJ says, "Isn't that Macy Gray?" I turn just in time to see Macy and her kid(s) walk by me and up the stairs to Gap kids.   We came back to the hotel and relaxed for a while. We decided that we were going to explore Miami public transportation and make our way to Bayside Marketplace to do some more shopping and eating. Around 5:00 as we are online mapping out our route, my girl SS (the airport drop-offer who arrived in Miami on Saturday) calls. She and her friend wanted to hang out with us that night. SS said they were eating and she'd call as soon as they were done. I'm sure you'll see in future posts that SS isn't the most timely person I know so we should have just gone on with our plans. So LJ and I drop the Bayside idea for now and go lay out by the pool. We wait for the call and to make a long story short, SS and her friend arrive at our hotel at 9:30. What happened between 5 and 9 I'm not sure.  Anway, we head back to Cocowalk to hang out and get something to eat. LJ and I are very hungry by that time because we've been waiting on SS and company to show up. We went to this place Margarita Momma or something like that to eat. As we are out on the deck eating, there are djs setting up for the night. Apparently this is a restaurant by day and club by night. The music out on the deck is getting us in a dancing mood. We decide to head inside to the dance floor after eating. The four of us go inside and nobody is dancing. We just go ahead and dance figuring eventually someone will join in. No go. Okay, well there was that 5 minute span when there were actually other people dancing, but that was about it. Maybe it had something to do with that wack DJ who didn't know how to blend songs. He'd just totally switch up the mood/tempo/rhythm..whatever from song to song. I didn't get it. SS's friend was tired so we left and they dropped us back off at the hotel.   LJ and I made plans to wake up early Sunday, head to South Beach and hit the Bayside Marketplace. Once I woke up and looked at the clock, it was going on 11am. So much for that early start. We got ready, finished looking up our route information and headed on a walk to the Coconut Grove metrorail station. It was a long walk in the heat. We stopped on the way and got some italian ice which basically saved us. We made it to the station. We hopped on the Metrorail and headed downtown to Government Center. We walked to the bus depot about a block away to wait for the bus to South Beach. It was actually a pretty easy trip down...no problems.  We got out and walked around a bit. It was wall to wall of my folks. It was a huge meat market. We stopped and grabbed a slice of pizza and ate outside at a table on the sidewalk. As we sat we people watched and caught some eyefuls. The guys who missed the plane right after me also came by. One of them looked at me, smiled and said "We made it!" Yes we did.  We went out to the beach area and it was CRAAAZY! Collins Ave was just taken over. We were everywhere. It was really a mad house. Needless to say whenever more than 3 of us are gathered there will be a strong police presence. I can say that I didn't see any illegal or rowdy behavior while I was in "the action", but I was annoyed just the same. We headed over to the vendors at the edge of the beach and I wished I hadn't already eaten. Talk about some good looking/smelling food! BBQ ribs and chicken, Fried chicken, pork chops, and fish. Jerk chicken, plantains, rice and beans, veggie fried rice, frozen drinks, hot dogs, burgers, pizza, and the list just goes on. It had me drooling even though I had just eaten.  We got out on the beach and the first thing I noticed was the lack of black people in that particular section. Then I noticed the lack of females in that section. Then I noticed the unusally large number of chiseled men in Speedos in that section. Then I noticed the rainbow flag. Oooooh okay! Now I get it. LJ and I thought this would be the "safest" place for us. We could enjoy the beach in peace without somebody yelling "Hey ma! Where you from? Where  yall partying tonight? Can I take your picture? You need a ride?" We were right. We had a beautiful time just relaxing. We also saw an aquaintence from college there. It wasn't really a surprise to see him in that section, but it was just interesting that we did. I had a great time.   Once we left the actual beach, we stopped at a booth to get a henna tattoo. We both got them on our lower back. I got a sun and LJ got some sort of design. They are cool. We had passed the Bayside Marketplace on our bus to South Beach, so we decided to hit that on the way back in. We got to a bus stop near the edge of South Beach before you get to the thick of things. The walk there was quite annoying just trying to get through all the people...not to mention the stares and stares and stares. YUCK!! You would think that I'm anti men from the way I'm talking, but I'm really not. I just don't like that whole meat market vibe. You get it at the club too. Why would you even want to entertain someone's advances that are based solely on the fact that you are a breathing female who happens to be walking down Collins Ave on Memorial Day weekend?   We caught the bus over to Bayside and did some souvenier shopping and ate at Hard Rock Cafe. On the way home, we had to take the Metro Mover back to the rail station. The Metro Mover is an automated people mover system that's much like Disney World's transportation system. It was a fun ride back to the Government Center. We hopped on the train back to Coconut Grove. We had to figure out a way from the station to the hotel because we didn't want to take that walk again. We were tired and more importantly it wasn't safe at night. We asked the security officer how to get back to South Bayshore Drive and he told us about the free bus. He told us where the stop was, but that we should wait until we saw the bus because there were some "knuckle heads" in the area who like to prey on tourists. So we chilled with the guy until the bus came. He told us that all Metro security guards are either active or retired police officers. He is a homicide detective and proceeded to tell us about Miami and the different areas. So a little before the bus came, he walked us down to the stop.   We got on the bus, and I asked the driver if he could tell us what the closest stop to the Doubletree was. He just shook his head like he didn't know. I was annoyed. First of all because I'm pretty sure if you drive a bus that goes down the same street as the Doubletree you'd know, secondly because I don't even think he was trying to know or hear what I was asking him before he shook his head and thirdly because he offered no kind of apologies or excuses. So what do you know, we're riding the bus and pass right by the hotel. There is a stop about a block away that we got off at. So you mean to tell me you drive this bus day in and day out around in circles, pass the Doubletree a million times each day, and you don't know where the heck the Doubletree is? Give me a break!!  We got back to the hotel and I got my things together. There would be a cab waiting to take me to the airport at 7am. So I made it to the airport and printed out my boarding passes. I checked my bags, got through security and went to my gate. I had a long wait before my 9:30 departure and I couldn't wait to get on the plane and sleep. I bought a snack and waited for the boarding call. Once the time to board had arrived, we were informed that there was severe weather in Atlanta and we were on a ground hold. Why did I have to have a connecting flight in Atlanta? So I tried my best to wait it out, but I did have to catch a few zzzs while waiting to leave Miami.   We were allowed to board about an hour and a half later. As we got closer to Atlanta I felt more and more nauseous. I made it without incident though. Because of all the delays, I had to rush right off the plane to board the final plane to BWI. I was hoping to have some time to get over my motion sickness. On the way to the plane I had my third and final celeb sighting. It was Aries Spears from Mad TV. I made it to my gate and I got right on and got ready to sleep. I arrived back at BWI around 4 I think and after a food stop, I made it home by 6.   It was a great trip, but now I'm tired.

       Ok...so I haven't been keeping up with this like I'd hoped. Oh well...where do I start. Well do you remember&nbsp; how I was talking about this great/not so great job I have? Well I just found out this week that my days are numbered. I have about 3 weeks left before they kick me to the curb. The project is winding down and I knew this day was coming, but I&nbsp;was given&nbsp;the impression that it wouldn't&nbsp;be until the end of the year. So now I gotta start the whole job hunting thing again. My only ally, TH had to break the news to me on Monday. He really just told me as a heads up so I could start planning my next move. Thanks TH...at least someone&nbsp;around here shows me a little consideration. He also told me that he'd talk to the genius who suddenly decided to let me go and ask for&nbsp;more time.&nbsp;Overall I guess it's not so bad...I was ready for a change. Like I said before it is about time for me to really do something. I just don't know what made them realize all of a sudden that I'm not doing anything and my position really is pointless. Why did it take a year for you to realize that? It was good while it lasted.     &nbsp;   In other news, I began my guitar lessons. My friend KH and I go every Tuesday evening and take lessons. Our teacher, CC is really cool. He has been playing for 15 years and is trying to tailor the lessons to our musical tastes. We can bring in songs that we want to learn and he'll build around that. We have only had 2 lessons, but I am really enjoying it. The hardest part so far is coordinating the fingering, but I'm slowly getting it. On my own I've tried my hand at learning a few Tweet songs. I never realized how simplistic her guitar playing is until I pretty much figured out 3 songs in one evening (and remember ---I suck!). I really hope I continue to do well so that I can use the guitar while writing songs, but my fingers hurt!     &nbsp;   My brother will be in town this weekend for his 10 year high school reunion.&nbsp;Have we&nbsp;really been out of H.S. that long?! I'm getting old. I will get to spend some good quality time with my 2 year old niece while my brother and&nbsp;sister (in law)&nbsp;are at the reunion. That should be an adventure. I bought a pool and we'll just wing it from there.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;
