      May 24, 2004  Players will be glad to hear that today we have expanded our RuneScape hiscores list to show the top 500,000 players in every skill. We have made this change as the competition was getting extremely fierce for a place in the hiscores in certain stats. You now have a greater chance of being able to see how you rank against your friends and enemies in your favourite skill!

      May 18, 2004  City life doesn't suit everyone, which is why Rantz and the rest of his ogre family have set up residence on the east coast in a cosy little cave with a nice view of the sea. However, independence comes at a cost. There's no more easy meals for the family and they currently have a hankering for Chompy Bird, a favourite delicacy of ogres.  Rantz is keen to start the Chompy Bird hunting season, but can't get started. He's all fingers and thumbs when it comes to making ogre arrows for his huge ogre bow. Is there someone kind and experienced enough with fletching to go help him and his starving family? Find out if you have what it takes in our new Big Chompy Bird Hunting Quest!

      June 29, 2004  Oops, it seems the friendlist server has run out of memory. I'm working on increasing the memory allocation now.  If you login at the moment your friendlist will appear empty, but don't worry it hasn't been lost, the server is just offline and will be back very shortly.

      June 29, 2004  We've added a couple of new options to make it easier to keep the contents of your bank arranged. (if you want to.)  1) At the bottom of the bank screen you will see 2 new buttons marked 'insert' and 'swap'.   'Swap' mode is the mode you are used to, whereby when an item is dragged to a new slot it swaps places with the item already there. This works exactly the same way as before.   'Insert' mode is a new option. In this mode dragging an item to a new position causes it to be inserted at that point, and everything else is moved up one space to make room. This is useful for instance if you get a new rune, and you want to place it next to your existing runes without having to manually move everything else.   2) It is now easier to move items a long way across your bank. Now if you drag an item to the top or bottom of the bank window, the window will automatically scroll up or down for you. This makes it much easier to move items several rows at a time. (note: this particular feature has actually been online for about a week now, but wasn't mentioned before so is here for completeness.)

      June 29, 2004  King Roald of Varrock has recently found communications with the Temple guarding the Eastern border of Misthalin have been abruptly cut off. Anxious that something may have happened to his close friend Drezel, he is seeking volunteers to go forth and discover what the problem may be.  Those in search of adventure should make their way to see King Roald in Varrock palace immediately, to set forth on the Priest In Peril quest!

      June 28, 2004  Today's update makes a variety of small improvements to RuneScape.    Bigger friends list for members!  As a new members benefit, you now get twice as much space on your friend-list. Giving you a total of 200 slots.    Multiple hit-splats during combat.  If a player or monster is being attacked by multiple opponents, or is taking damage very rapidly, the game will now show multiple damage indicators at once. This makes it much easier to see how much damage is being dealt. Note: the total damage received is the same, it's just shown more clearly now.    Npcs better at retreating.  We've improved the intelligence of the npcs a bit, such that if they are being attacked from beyond the edge of their wander zone, they will run away rather than just standing there stupidly.    Music+sounds work on more machines.  We've found why the music+sounds sometimes wasn't working when you select the SUN java plugin. We're still working on reaching 100% comptability, but a few more people should find it works for them now.    Fixed dragon-spear special attack.  We've fixed the bug which meant attacking a player with the dragon-spear special attack didn't give a pk-skull in the wilderness.

      June 24, 2004  The number of people playing RuneScape is still increasing rapidly, with a record 36,000 simultaneous players last night.  To help cope with all these new players we've added another 3 game worlds. Due to popular demand we've put some of the new ones in the UK this time.   The new servers are as follows: World-23: UK - free World-24: UK - members World-25: US - free   Enjoy!

      June 23, 2004  Today we have released an updated version of our RuneScape Windows client.  Use of this alternative client is entirely optional, and it doesn't add any extra features compared to playing through your web-browser at our website like normal. It does however allow you to play without all that browser clutter, which is particularly useful for low-memory or low-resolution machines.   The client can be found in the new Extra Files section on the front page. Unofficial downloads from other sites may contain malware, so to keep your account safe we recommend you only get the client from www.RuneScape.com

      June 21, 2004  Todays update is just a small one to make a few minor tweaks to the game. Some of the more noticeable changes are:   -The stone border around the edge of the game window is now narrower. This is to make the game fit better for people running at 800x600. The actual 3d view area is still the same size however. There is just less wasted space now.  -The chat scroll is now slightly brighter, to make chat easier to read.  -When you click to use an item, it now has a white outline to show that it is selected.  -Fixed several cases where using 2 objects together only worked one way around. (the order objects were clicked in made difference)  -Fixed a bug which meant the Iban-staff could be wielded at level 49, despite stating a requirement of 50.  -Fixed a couple of digsite bugs where it sometimes didn't recognise you had the required items.  -Fixed a bug with the treasure trail puzzle-box where it occasionally didn't recognise you had completed it.  -Lots of other minor changes and fixes.

      June 17, 2004  It has come to our attention that a number of our players are receiving fake emails claiming to be from Jagex, offering players the chance to apply to be player moderators.  Remember, Jagex does NOT send out emails to players EVER! If we want to send you a message we instead send it to your message-centre here on this website, and then notify you about it next time you login to the game.   We have our own message centre system and so have no reason to use email to contact you! Email is fundamentally insecure and easy to forge which is why we never ever use it to contact players.   If you are a player and you receive any email from us, it doesn't matter how genuine it looks, or what it says, you should always assume it is a fake!   Please do NOT under any circumstances reply to these emails, just delete them immediately, they are not from Jagex and are an attempt to steal account passwords.

      June 16, 2004  One of our hosting providers has accidentaly rebooted some of the key servers that run the game and the website. We are in the process of getting everything back online.  Unfortunately the servers power was basically pulled without warning, so some didn't even get a chance to save their data to the disk. This means the last 15 minutes of your activity may have been forgotten if you were playing at the time.   Apologies for any inconvenience caused - please bear with us while we restore everything back to normal.

      June 14, 2004  We have changed the way we are handling player reported bugs in order to more swiftly investigate and fix them.  The correct way to report RuneScape bugs now is to use the 'Bug reporting' section of the Customer Support menu (accessible via the Secure Menu). Here you can select the type of bug you are reporting and complete a form which will give our testers all the information they need to investigate the problem.   Within the Bug reporting section you will also be able to view the list of currently known bugs and their current status. You should check this list before sending in a bug report to make sure it's not an issue we are already aware of.   We have removed the bug forums on the RuneScape Forums and the bug categories within the Feedback section of Customer Support, as these are no longer needed.   Hopefully you won't need to use this section of the website very often! If you do come across a bug though, please give as much detail as possible. The more information you provide, the quicker we can track down and fix the problems.

      June 14, 2004   Special Attacks   Today we have introduced some special attacks to a variety of members only weapons. The dragon weapons, excalibur, rune throwing axes and magic bows now all have different special attacks. There are many types of special attacks, from temporary boosts in stats, to strikes dealing extra damage.   In the combat interfaces of these weapons you will now notice a new special attack bar. If you click on the bar, then your character will initiate a special attack and use up some of your special attack power. Different special attacks use up different amounts of power. If you do not have enough power for a special attack, then you can't do it. Your special attack power will slowly restore over time.   Expect more types of special attacks on future weapons.    Mining and thieving from stalls   In Runescape Classic, if two people managed to get ore from a rock at exactly the same time, or steal something at the exact same time from a stall then they would both get it. This previously didn't happen in Runescape, making it much harder to gain resources in competitive situations. We have now changed it so both people will get the resources.    Treasure trail clues   Two more npc types now drop treasure trail clues; happy hunting!    Strange fruit   Strange fruit now heals more run energy than it did previously.

      June 14, 2004  We are very pleased to announce today the introduction of In-Game Player Moderators!  These moderators are trusted RuneScape players who have been hand-picked by Jagex Staff to help keep the game a fun and safe environment for everyone else. As well as being normal players, they also have the privilege of sending in priority abuse reports, and can also mute players who are breaking our chat rules.   To help you spot moderators in-game, we have added two crown icons which will appear next to a moderators name in the chat log when they speak:  Player Moderators - Grey Crowns Forum Moderators - Gold Crowns  The Jagex Team

      June 8, 2004  Today we updated agility to be much more effective at helping you restore your run energy. The previous effect wasn't very noticable so it's been improved. The same agility level now decreases the restore time by approximately 50% more than it did previously, so should hopefully be a bit more worthwhile now.  We also fixed the following bugs:    -Fixed a bug with fishing, where the animation didn't always run in the right place, and where large crowds in one place made the fish vanish.  -Made random-event npcs appear on top of other players in crowded situations so you don't accidently miss them.  -Fixed a bug with the chat/friendlist sometimes failing to work reliably if you tried to use them and smith at the same time.  -Fixed a bug which caused the client to ocassionally lock up.  -Fixed a bug with the welcome screen sometimes displaying the wrong message.  -Fixed a bug with the cinematic camera scenes sometimes pointing at the wrong height  -Lots of other minor fixes

      June 2, 2004  At Jagex we take a great pride in our online community and it has always been our policy to take a hard line on anyone who is offensive in our game as we want to keep runescape as pleasant a gaming experience as possible.  Of late though we have been receiving a large amount of in game abuse reports, many falsely reported or in the wrong category. We would like to take this opportunity to remind all players that if you misuse the abuse report function we will ban you from sending in reports. However please don't let this put you off sending in legitimate reports because these are greatly appreciated and will help to make runescape a better and more friendly community for all players. Can we remind you of things that don't warrant a report:  A low combat level player offering to sell valuable items.  Players selling over priced or under priced items.  Non offensive language e.g. noob, froob, choob etc.  Starred out language e.g. where the chat filter has done its job and starred out the offending words.  Please bear this in mind before reporting a player.

      June 2, 2004  Hundreds of years ago a mineral was found that had the ability to absorb, transform, or focus magic. For many years the knowledge of this material was lost, but now there has been talk of the rediscovery of this ore and the machinery to work it. See if you can reacquire the lost knowledge of elemental ore in the new Elemental Workshop Quest!   Thieving Changes We have also reduced the amount of time you are stunned for when you are caught thieving which should be good news for the kleptomaniacs amongst us.

      June 1, 2004  If you are noticing that the game suddenly seems to be lagging or taking longer to download than before, it's a temporary effect caused by everyone prefetching the music and maps all at once.  The huge number of files the server is sending to everyone combined is slowing it down a bit, but once everyone has them things should return to normal.   I've just temporarily slowed down the rate at which the server sends the maps and music which should reduce the in-game lag a bit, but it will probably still be about 24 hours before things calm down to normal levels. After which point I'll speed the download rate up again.   Of course the whole point of this update is to prevent this sort of problem repeatedly occuring everytime we add new content in the future. So if we can just get through this one last big update things should run a lot smoother from then on.

      June 1, 2004  That's right! Saradomin, our resident deity of order and virtue has deigned to allow himself to answer a few questions sent in by players in Letters 20. As usual, those wishing to know what the gods of RuneScape have to say to their followers (and just players in general too) should make their way immediately to the Library of Varrock to see what mysteries and secrets may be revealed this time...

      June 1, 2004  Today we have replaced the update system that RuneScape uses to grab updates from the server.  The new system has 3 main advantages:   1) Whilst this update will take a while to load, It will make all future updates much faster to download, up to 10x faster. Before if we updated a model the game redownloaded the entire model pack, now it just grabs the changed ones. You won't really see this improvement until our next update though, because for this update your system has to get all the models in the new incremental format.   2) For non-essential files the game will now let you login and start playing even whilst they are still downloading! For instance you can login before all the models have arrived, and if the game needs one it will just quickly fetch it as necessary. This means new players coming into the game can get started much quicker. However if you prefer everything to be 100% ready before login, then just wait for the "extra files" counter on the title-screen to reach 100% before logging in.   3) The game now prefetches maps & music whilst you are playing, so when entering a new area for the first time there will be less of a delay for the map to load, and the music to start. Again you won't really see the benefit of this straight away because currently your computer will be missing quite a lot of files, but once you have fully downloaded the current update you should experience much shorter delays in the future   I'm sure some of you are thinking, "Well that's all good, but what we really want is content updates." Don't worry we have a new quest just around the corner, which we will release as soon as we are confident the new update system is running smoothly for everyone. There's a lot of new code here, so we just want to be certain it's working properly first.   Thanks Andrew

      June 1, 2004  We have made some further improvements to the Hiscores system in addition to those made last week, with the introduction of a new way to see the hiscores. Now when logging into the secure area of the site you can see a special set of hiscore tables with only you and your friends names in them, making it easier than ever to see how close you are to beating your friends in a skill.  You now have the perfect excuse to delete everyone on your friends list who is better than you and be the best in your circle of friends... unless everyone else you know does the same thing!

      July 27, 2004   Brimhaven Agility Arena   The enterprising Cap'n Izzy No-Beard invites you to the Brimhaven Agility Arena, entry is only 200 gp! The entrance is the bamboo hut in the north-east part of Brimhaven.  The Agility Arena is a huge cavern of platforms connected by traps and obstacles. There are many different routes to get around the agility arena, you are much more likely to fail the obstacles on some routes than on others, some ways can not even be taken until you reach a certain agility level.  One platform is marked by a flashing arrow, try and make your way to it. Every minute a different platform will become the one with the flashing arrow instead. If you tag more than one pillar in a row then you will receive a ticket. You won't get a ticket at the first pillar but you will for every pillar you tag after that. If you miss a pillar then you will miss out on the next ticket so try and get as many as you can! You can save up these tickets and trade them in for more agility experience or for some items which you can't get anywhere else.  There is no agility requirement but players with low agility will find it difficult to get any tickets. As your agility level increases and you can take more routes through the arena and you start to fail the traps and obstacles less you will begin to get significantly more tickets.   There be booty to be got, ye landlocked landlubbers!    New Potions   2 of the things you can get from your agilty arena tickets are new herbs - Toadflax and Snapdragon. These are the potions associated with those herbs.  Herblore level 34: Toadflax + Toads' Legs = Agility PotionEffect: Raises agility level by 3Herblore level 63: Snapdragon + Red Spiders' Eggs = Super Restore PotionEffect: Restores stats including some prayer   Party Room changes   Party pete will now periodically clear worthless junk from the drop chest. He will leave anything which he thinks has some value.If there are lots of items in the chest, you now get a greater chance of getting something in a balloon.It is also now cheaper to pull the lever or get the knights to dance.

      July 27, 2004  We've unfortunately just had to permanently ban 80 players for bug abuse. In this case for taking advantage of a bug which made it possible to get a certain quest reward repeatedly rather than just once.  We would like to remind everyone that we will not tolerate players who abuse bugs in RuneScape, and serious abusers will always be banned. If you are in any doubt on our rules, please take the time to review them again.  These days we produce detailed logs of all activity on RuneScape, so even if someone abuses a bug we don't yet know about, when we DO find out about (and we will), then we'll check back through our historical logs and ban them anyway. It's just not possible to get away with this abuse anymore.  It pains us greatly to lose 80 members in this way, and we just can't believe that 80 players have just chosen to throw away hours of work, by deliberately abusing a bug! There was no chance of getting away with it. Why did you do it?  So please do not risk your account in this way. If you do find a bug in RuneScape, the right action is to immediately report it through our bug report form in the customer support section of the website, and then to avoid doing it again.  Finally we would like to reassure our users that we are very, very careful not to ban people who have only gained from a bug accidentally. The players we just banned were all players who abused the bug repeatedly, many over 100 times in order to try and gain an unfair advantage. Players who reported the bug to us were given more leeway, although even if you report it that doesn't give you excuse to then go and use it repeatedly until it's fixed.  Be safe, and dont abuse bugs you find. Report them immediately!

      July 20, 2004   Quest Journals   We have now greatly improved the in game quest interface. Clicking on a quest in your quest menu will now bring up a journal recording what has been achieved so far by your character on that quest.As well as giving an interesting record of your characters past glories, we think this will be very useful for people who start a quest and then stop doing it for a little while. This will give them a good reminder on what point they are up to.It will also be very useful when we release the sequels for quests for people to be able to reread the story so far.      Chompy Bird Hats   As some of you will know, once you have finished the Big Chompy Bird Hunting quest you can start to get ranks as a chompybird hunter. This rank is based on the number of the birds you have killed.There is now a hat for each rank of Ogre bowman and upwards. Each hat looks different so other players can see roughly how many chompybirds you have killed. Get your hat by showing the notches on your ogre bow to Rantz.

      July 13, 2004  The priest Drezel has a special request for any adventurous sorts to search for the Druid 'Filliman Tarlock' and brave the terrors that infest the swamp of Mort Myre. Those ready for the awaiting challenge should prepare themselves for the Nature Spirit quest!

      July 13, 2004  The gloves that can be bought from the shop in the new priest in peril area have temporarily been made a members only items as a result of the Nature Spirit update. This means that at the moment they can not be traded to free players and that free players who own a pair of the coloured gloves can not wear them.  Please note this was not intentional and these gloves have now been made a non-members item again. We have updated the code and we will be uploading it very soon.  Please do not send in queries to our customer support staff regarding this matter, just remain patient, and those free players who own a pair of the gloves but at the moment can not wear them just keep hold of your gloves and you will soon be able to use them again. This fix will be uploaded as soon as possible.

      July 2, 2004  We apologise for the temporary downtime of a few of our game-worlds today. These servers are now back online.  The problem was caused whilst attempting to install 2 new servers at one of our hosting sites. When the hosting company plugged the 2 new servers in for us, the circuit overloaded which unfortunately caused the other servers on that circuit to reset.   We are informed that the other servers on that circuit have now been transferred to another UPS, so it should be ok now.

      August 4, 2004  As you have all discovered there are 4 new emote animations, these are Glass wall, Glass box, Climb rope and Lean. You will initially find that you can not use these emote animations. To unlock them you will need to wait until you get the new mime random event (see main news story titled "New Random Events!"). On successfully completing a mime random event one of the new emotes will be unlocked. You will need to successfully complete 4 mime random events in order to unlock all 4 new emotes.

      August 4, 2004  Today regular visitors to our website might notice that we have massively overhauled the front page!  We know some of you might be used to our old layout, but we think that once you are used to the new design you will agree that it is easier to navigate. We have tried to make the front-page make better use of the available screen space, as well as making the most accessed areas (for example the worldmap) easier and quicker to get to.  The layout of the manual has also been improved, and lots of new information has been added, including a few new sections for you to discover yourselves!  You will also be glad to know we have added an all new exclusive wallpaper to our extra files section, which has moved towards the bottom of the main menu.  Finally, Mozilla Firefox 0.9 users will be pleased to know that we have improved compatibility with that browser, so you will now be able to login to the secure section of the site with less hassle than before.

      August 3, 2004  We have had to move worlds 19,20,21 and 25 to a different location, because the company that was providing bandwidth for them previously has suddenly ceased trading. This meant we had to arrange an alternative at very short notice.  So we could get them up and running again as quickly as possible, those worlds have now been moved to one of our other existing providers.  Their new home is 'nlayer'. We already had a few worlds there and were very happy with their reliability/performance, so in fact the relocated worlds should hopefully run faster than ever at their new location.  All the worlds should now be functioning normally again.

      August 2, 2004  We've had to temporarily take our CET worlds offline to move them to a new bandwidth provider.  Unfortunately our old bandwidth provider for those worlds gave us absolutely no notice that they were ceasing trading, and so we've had to arrange an alternative at very short notice.  The worlds are being moved across now, to a different cabinet in the same buildling, and should hopefully be back up shortly (within a couple of hours I hope). I know this isn't the best time of day to be moving servers around, but we were somewhat rushed by the lack of notice. Sorry for the inconveniance.  The CET worlds won't work meanwhile so, please use another world, and I'll post again as soon as they are back. ThanksAndrew

      August 2, 2004  Players may be thrilled to witness the addition of new random events today. The events you may come across in your usual routine of playing are as follows:   Maze  You might get teleported into a magical maze by some mysterious old man, but don't worry. Find the centre and you'll be released, along with a reward. The quicker you manage it, the bigger your reward! You will then be put back where you came from.   Strange Box  If you're given a Strange Box by a mysterious old man, open it and answer the easy question to receive a reward. Be warned though; if you spend too long without opening a box, or get a question wrong, they will start replicating in your inventory, so you will have more boxes to solve. You will only get a reward when you have cleared your inventory of boxes. The only way to remove a box from your inventory is to answer the question.   Mime  There's a mystical theatre hidden away which you may get teleported to. (Coincidentally enough, by an old and mysterious man). All you have to do is follow the Mime's performance by repeating his actions and you'll be released back to where you were previously along with a reward.  Note: If any mysterious old men teleport you to the maze or the mime they will do it immediately. If they instead stand there shouting your name, you should respond like normal. Ignoring old men in the hopes they will teleport you to a maze will not work.

      August 2, 2004  Zamorak, our much-maligned deity of chaos and destruction, has informed us that he has some answers to players questions in our new edition of  Letters 22 .  We say 'informed', we actually mean 'threatened to suffer a horrible fate involving honey, rope, and a particularly vicious swarm.  Those intrigued to know what secrets might be revealed, and who wish to spare us honest, hard working Jagex folk his wrath, should make their way immediately to the Library of Varrock - please don't hurt us Zamorak!
