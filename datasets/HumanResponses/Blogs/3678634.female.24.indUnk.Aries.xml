      After reading what Lindsey had said - I too have something to get off my chest that has really been bothering me.  It has really balled up in my chest and carrying it around has become such a burden, and it has been weighing me down. As I write this I become really nervous. I have been afraid of telling anyone because I didn't want anyone to think little of me.    Breath in breath out.  OK, here is goes.  A)I have seen Vanilla Ice's movie, Cold As Ice. AND... B)I think he is good looking. As I say this, I am laughing my head off - but I can't deny a good jaw line.  I'm guilty. The only thing that kind of stammers me is that his real name is Robert Van Winkle.  Bob Van Winkle....  Anything that rhymes with tinkle...I have a problem with.   I know this may reach an all time low for many of the worlds standards. But I can now stand a little bit taller.     Word to your mother.

      The skys at night are big and rainy - clap, clap, clap, - deep in the heart of Texas...  I get up this morning to go run and it is doing the same thing it has been doing for the past serveral months - raining.  Record rains have hit Dallas, Texas.  Normally we would be in the 90's - but it looks, smells, and feels like the northwest.    I live by a creek which I now call the roaring rapids; the running track is all along it - so, yes I didn't run thins morning. 2 strikes.  As I got in to work today I parked near the D-train next to the boxter, bmw, and the benz. I am a corporate marketeer - but I don't have the lux. car. And I ask myself - "Do you really need that" and I reply "no, I would rather save money and travel while I pay off my house".  And the i's think to me's self... Maybe I should make more money... But thinking like that is a slippery slope. I am lucky to have this job and work with people I like.  So...I like, no I love my  urlLink Jeep  - I'd rather put my cash on something else...  Anyways - back to the D-train...I parked actually underneath it - certain places around Dallas it is like the monarail - spellcheck?  As all the commuters swept by - a huge rush of rain fell on me; I wish someone else was there to enjoy the humorous momment - buckets-o-water on my head.   I almost started tap dancing and doing a rendition of "Singing in the Rain" from - you got it, "Singing in the Rain".  Instead I got my size of China umbrella out and walked into work.  It kept my head dry, but my  urlLink Stuart Weitzman  got soaked.     All in all it was a great morning.

      Well the alarm went off but I didn't.  I even ended up over sleeping - lovely.  Does this make me a bad person?  I do have an excuse though.  I stayed up too late sick.  I have become  urlLink lactose  retarded in my old age of 24.  I had some dairy last night and was sick to my stomach.  Anyways - I will go run and lift weights yada yada yada this evening.    dang dang dang.

      Man, I am happy - my friend LG and I talked and it has been a long arse time.  She is awesome.  I wish I had taped all the idiotic things we did.  We are dangerous together - thats the fun of it.  She has a awesome heart to and has done some really cool things at her young age.    She will soon come back to the USA from Spain - she has been living/working over there for a year. I wish I wasn't house sitting and or dog sitting - I would have gone to celebrate the 4th with her - dizang.  Her grandfather is pretty much funny as hell.  I don't know the context but yelled "chicken shit in the moonlight" and i rolled.  It rings true with "Unkie goergie" too.  We are drunk on life.  I love that - i need to get back to that.   No one will find that funny - except  urlLink Lindsey . JC loves you.

      All right, I did it - I got up - ran and took a shower, ate break', left for work. Normally I watch news in the morning before I go to work, but now I can't - so I get here to work and find out that they have already handed over Iraq.    Opportunity cost.

      Traffic in Dallas is interesting.  Weather if you are in the city on the highway, in the 'burbs driving...it takes about twenty to thirty minutes to get anywhere you want to go.  You can go to one side of say, plano, to the other side - in the same time it takes you to get from plano to downtown. When I was young I imagined everyone had their own highways that went to anywhere they wanted to go.  right.     I am frustrated.  I have been working on a newspaper advertisement for awhile and I am not happy with the layout - my brain is not working today. It will prob go to 7-10 newspapers nation wide, so it needs to be general.    I hate to admit to this, but I was watching the Ashlee Simpson show and I saw someone I knew from college.  They live in the same area I guess bc she went over to his house.  Take this for example.  I see people everywhere I go that I have known either from high school, college, or from random events.  I was hopping on a plan to Atlanta a couple of weeks ago at 8 in the morning and saw an old friend who now lived in Atlanta.  I was in Austin eating at the hole in the wall bbq joint and boom, two more people.  Then out of everyone in NYC, two of my friends who moved there who don't know each other are next door neigbors in a highrise of about 500 people.  Everything is connected. I am like Kevin Bacon.  I found two more peeps I knew from HS are getting married.  REALLY funny to think that these two are marrying off.  They must have matured over the college and post college years, bc I can't see these peeps getting married.  I think love, marriage is very honorable and awesome.  But to me...it is forever.  I would be really sad if I were to get married right now - being in love is one thing, but marriage is different. It is a lot of compromise and sacrifice.  I guess I am selfish and onesided in my thinking at the momment.  People say when ya know, ya know.  Well I need a blinking neon sign from god pointing down to the appropriate one because I am pretty dumb founded when it comes to guys liking me. I'd like it to be easy, but nothing ever is for cav.  I will not see Michael Moore's new film.  I was in a film class and we went through his former films, although interesting and disturbing, were extremely biased and untrue.  The professor, even though extreme libral - still was a man of honesty -ha - and went through and picked his facts - that turned out to be opinions - which is a lie.  So in my mind, why go see a film that is based on an opinion of someone who is willing to break down the USA.  If you don't like it, leave buddy.  See how well you could do in...say....Chad or Sri Lanka.

      So I watched this show on the travel channel tonight about log cabins.  I have decided I would really like one. I wouldn't need one as extravegent as some of these were, reaching to the 65 million point. I would be happy with one big room, bedroom, bath, kitchen - there ya go.  Somewhere to lay my head. I have wanted one for a long time and there have been times where my family thought about building one in Colorado on our land.  The thing with that is that I would want to be near a river or a lake.  I am picky.  I love Texas, but colorado feels like home.  I know it like Texas.  I have been a lot of places and done a lot of things, but i think the best summer/time of my life was when I lived in Taos, NM for a month, then went up to colorado - Rocky Mtn Nat'l Park area, picked my Mom up at the airport and chilled there for 3 more weeks.  I loved the nights - the stars and the cool breeze and the smell of pinon pinewood in the fire.  I was there with a random group but I remember Will bc we shared rooms and none of the other girls cared about getting out.  We would wake up and go for a hike, see a bear, eat some breakfast - then we would drive out to eagles nest and fish on the cimeron valley.  Catch some huge german browns.  I caught the biggest trout ever, but I was so far out I couldn't show anyone; but some of that is why it is so special to me.  We would go to the sage brush and dance, but I was too ashamed/embarrassed to danced when asked.  Why? I don't know. I saw Rumsfield on memorial day - he winked at me.  In colorado, in the evening, hop in the tahoe - get some A&W rootbear and a bucket of chicken and go out to the pasture and watch the elk grase til the sun went down and just talk - really talk - or not talk at all - being still is so important.  I think you really know someone when you dont have to talk at all - make sense?  Wake up go over trail ridge and have brunch at grand lake - go into town and walk around. I am trying to put into words how happy and what great memories I have had over the years doing that stuff. I become very nostalgic and teary eyes discussing this.  It saddens me that what I like to do most is what I do least.  I have so many things put upon me I feel I have to do - bc its what is expected.  I think many struggle with this.  Maybe in a couple of years if I have no commitments, I may venture up there.  His plan is perfect - his will ya know.  Mandy is having a small party tomorrow night at her new place.  She is a chef and knows wine.  She formally worked with some people at tony's wine cellar, so we will be doing some tasting I guess.  Those guys are always fun.  I like meeting new and ramdom people.  Broaden my horizons.  My friend loaned me this book out and when I initally got it, I was full force.  Now I read a little of it and I want to go to bed.  I am not disinterested, more like I am burned out.  I had read several books in a row - bang bang bang - so I think I need a break.  I will finish it though, sooner than later.   Next weekend will be the 4th.  I was invited to go to LA, but I need a weekend to relax for once. Sorry Bregan, I would love to see you and Cali, but it is not looking that way.   I am going to go dream of a mountain stream and a cabin with my name on it.  That would be the greatest gift ever.

      I found out Dani was assulted by a frenchman, he punched her in the face while no onlookers helped. Dang french people. It's ok though, she kicked him where the sun dont shine. The police didnt take a report, however they did flirt with her.  Thanks Nice, France.   Here is an important thing to ask yourself. "What you think about God is the most important thing about you." I truly believe that - more than anything I think you can find out about a persons heart with this statement.  In your deepest heart, what do you perceive God to be like? Some people's ideas are not compelete. Until their view changes, their convictions will be dulled.  Been there. People know God intellectually, but not experientially. And heck, some people don't know him at all.   Here is a little something I read tonight and loved...  Ask if you have not received. There is nothing more difficult than asking. We will have yearnings and desires for certain things, and even suffer as a result of their going unfulfilled, but not until we are at the limit of desperation will we ask. It is the sense of not being spiritually real that causes us to ask. Have you ever asked out of the depths of your total insufficiency and poverty? "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God . . . " ( James 1:5 ), but be sure that you do lack wisdom before you ask. You cannot bring yourself to the point of spiritual reality anytime you choose. The best thing to do, once you realize you are not spiritually real, is to ask God for the Holy Spirit, basing your request on the promise of Jesus Christ (see Luke 11:13 ). The Holy Spirit is the one who makes everything that Jesus did for you real in your life.   "Everyone who asks receives . . . ." This does not mean that you will not get if you do not ask, but it means that until you come to the point of asking, you will not receive from God (see Matthew 5:45 ). To be able to receive means that you have to come into the relationship of a child of God, and then you comprehend and appreciate mentally, morally, and with spiritual understanding, that these things come from God.   "If any of you lacks wisdom . . . ." If you realize that you are lacking, it is because you have come in contact with spiritual reality—do not put the blinders of reason on again. The word ask actually means "beg." Some people are poor enough to be interested in their poverty, and some of us are poor enough spiritually to show our interest. Yet we will never receive if we ask with a certain result in mind, because we are asking out of our lust, not out of our poverty. A pauper does not ask out of any reason other than the completely hopeless and painful condition of his poverty. He is not ashamed to beg—blessed are the paupers in spirit (see Matthew 5:3 ).    ---- More insight.  Be determined to know more than others. If you yourself do not cut the lines that tie you to the dock, God will have to use a storm to sever them and to send you out to sea. Put everything in your life afloat upon God, going out to sea on the great swelling tide of His purpose, and your eyes will be opened. If you believe in Jesus, you are not to spend all your time in the calm waters just inside the harbor, full of joy, but always tied to the dock. You have to get out past the harbor into the great depths of God, and begin to know things for yourself—begin to have spiritual discernment.   When you know that you should do something and you do it, immediately you know more. Examine where you have become sluggish, where you began losing interest spiritually, and you will find that it goes back to a point where you did not do something you knew you should do. You did not do it because there seemed to be no immediate call to do it. But now you have no insight or discernment, and at a time of crisis you are spiritually distracted instead of spiritually self-controlled. It is a dangerous thing to refuse to continue learning and knowing more.   The counterfeit of obedience is a state of mind in which you create your own opportunities to sacrifice yourself, and your zeal and enthusiasm are mistaken for discernment. It is easier to sacrifice yourself than to fulfill your spiritual destiny, which is stated in Romans 12:1-2 . It is much better to fulfill the purpose of God in your life by discerning His will than it is to perform great acts of self-sacrifice. "Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice . . ." ( 1 Samuel 15:22 ). Beware of paying attention or going back to what you once were, when God wants you to be something that you have never been. "If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know . . ." ( John 7:17 ).

      So, G'ma had angeoplasty and her arteries are clean and clear - they sent her home.  They don't know what the heck went on. She must be just getting old. But that was good news.  We all went over to her house and had Dickie's BBQ. While easting we watched TV. My dad is OCD with the remote controll.  It is almost hilarious. It was almost like a little kid complaining that he wanted candy when he couldn't find fox sports.  My Uncle Bob, Aunt Joy and Christine were over too.  They got to experience the OCD first hand. They thought it was funny as well funny. I think my uncle may suffer from the same problem.  My family calls the remote control the clicker. In college people laughed at me that I called it that. Ha.   Zim had lasik done yesterday - maybe I will get that one day.

      Somebody pick up my pieces I'm scattered everywhere And put me back together And put me way over there. Take me out of contention I surrender my crown So somebody pick up my pieces It's just me comin' down. Well, I sure thought I had him Lord, I know he had me " What I thought was heaven Is just falling debris Well, I may not be crazy But I got one hell of a start Somebody pick up my pieces, I think I'm fallin' apart. Don't follow my footsteps, Step over my trail. The road is too narrow And your footing could fail And the fall to the bottom Could tear you apart And they'll be pickin' up pieces Of you and your heart Don't follow my footsteps Step over my trail  The road is too narrow And your footing could fail And the fall to the bottom Could tear you apart And they'll be pickin' up pieces Of you and your heart, And they'll be pickin' up pieces of you and your heart.  Have you every been that low?  Where on the way down you get hurt even more? And you are not willing to take anyone with you, even if they love you? Not sure if that makes sence to someone outside my brain. Makes clear sense to me.   I am together, but i am not TOGETHER.  I think I have allowed too many things to slide that I thought didn't matter.  Its funny how I can care so much, but care so little. I think I thought things would work out, but I think the ball is in my court to make some changes.   Lord, help me to succeed. Its hard when you have no accountabilty in the flesh. I can't see mine, but I know he is there.  It would be a lot easier if I could see him and hear him like i hear the radio.

      I wanted to share this.  I really would love to live my life like this. Keep on striving. In the words of Mother Theresa...  People are unreasonable, illogical and self-centered. Love them anyway! If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives. Do good anyway! If you are successful, you will win false friends and enemies. Succeed anyway! The good you do will be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway! Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable. Be honest and frank anyway! What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight. Build anyway! People really need help but may attack you if you help them. Help them anyway! Give the world the best you have and you’ll get kicked in the teeth. Give the world the best you’ve got anyway!

      Last night was a blast. Lotso laughs, but it made me realize things are going to change after this summer.  My closest click will finally two years later go all different ways. Heather is moving to Colorado to go back to school, Aimee is getting married, Zimmer is getting her MBA and prob go off with Brian, Shannon will finish up law school, Mandy and I are moving north… We will see each other and play but won’t ever be the same.  And Kristin, where the heck are you – you flake.  One thing is for sure, change happens. I don’t mind that at all.  Change is awesome.  I don’t like things necessarily to stay the same.  I like the fact I never know what will happen. I think that gets me by sometime.  I am ready for some change….bring it.  We played some funny games last night – mostly games that use cards. Everyone has their own number and once the question is asked, everyone puts a card face down who they think it is. A lot of the questions were who was mostly likely to…blah blah you fill in the blank.  There were some hilarious, rank, and random questions.  Oddly enough, if the cards dictate my life, I will be potentially famous, last to marry, but have a lot of kids, and make some doe.   I think I did pretty well being that most of the other questions were nasty. We did the games at the beginning of the night, so we made fun of what our “futures” hold the rest of the evening.  Note: guys are attracted to a pack of girls with one wearing a veil.  Its almost like they can’t have what they can’t have….or it is a challenge.  Are all guys like that?  Nah...  Mandy saw an old guy she used to date last night.  He was precious and had the most beautiful smile.  He gave me a good vibe. Is that weird to think some one is a good person just from a short initial smile and meeting. He was a dentist…. That’s prob why he has nice teeth. Wanna check my mouth out?  Dragon Fly is a funny place to go. Great place to people watch.  I like going out nice, but twelve dollar drinks add up especially when you are buying. Blah.  I think I could appreciate it on a date or more intimate setting – with less people. Too many famous, uppity people, silk shirt men and boobs.    Saw Grandma tonight. She seemed restless.  She never asks for help and complains that no one will help her up at the hospital.  Not her fault I guess. She grew up where everyone has taken care of her.  Her mom, father, husband and children take care of her every step.  I couldn’t live like that. I love serving others, but I like to take care of myself.  Some guys like taking care of girls and some want girls to take care of themselves.  I think there is a happy medium.   I know I don’t want to have to take care of a guy 24/7.  I say that now, but I have never been in love.  That could change everything.   I think love has been on my mind because Aimee and Steve are ready to just get it done. They need to get married…dated close to 6 years.   I think knowing someone that long it a benefit. I think people date too short and get married too fast sometimes. No wonder the divorce rate is high.  People mistake love for lust and aren’t friends. Recently I look at the Reagan's relationship.  I'd love that.   I think I have become lactose intolerant. My stomach has problems anytime I eat or drink dairy products.  Thats fun, isn't it? I have only drank skim milk my whole life.  Danielle grew up drinking whole - if you ask me might as well drink puss. Now I should get on some calcium suppliment.

      It is 2:30 in the afternoon, but it looks like eight o'clock at night due to rain.  The tv and lights keep coming off an on. Welcome to my weekend.  Zim came over last night to see the pups. As anyone would she loved them; how could you not.  I would like to get a picture up to show them off, but I haven't figured that out yet.  We also went out back and picked some flowers. The hydrangeas, gerberas, and verbena are going to town. Looked like a bridesmaid’s boutique.  After the pickin’ went up the road to legacy and grabbed a jamba. Sara got a bag and I eye shopped.  I saw something I liked but saving for a house, saving for a house, saving for a house.  I have to keep telling myself that.  When I got in last night, I came to find out my grandmother was in the ER.  She has been having some congestion, chest pains, and breathing trouble.  So, they emitted her and they think she may have had a heart attack earlier in the week.  She looked pretty good last night, just tired. They will do some angioplasty to see what is really up.  She turns 79 on July forth if I am thinking correctly.  She lived by herself in a new house she got after Grandpa died.  It’s nice because she is only a town away, where my aunt lives.    Family. It is sad to me that some people never really get to know their grandparents, aunts/uncles, let alone their parents. I like that everyone lived in the greater Dallas area. I do have family out of state, but truthfully I know them like endeared acquaintances.  Don’t get me wrong, I love them but they haven’t become a priority. I don’t mean that to sound trite. Do you get what I mean though?   Dad had to cancel his golf game and fathers day for that matter to be at the hospital.  He is a good son. I am sure this whole thing stresses him out physically and mentally because he is thinking about what happened to his dad, health, etc.  Worry about nothing, pray about everything.   Tonight I am going to a surprise bachelorette party for one of my best friends. Aimee.  Hmm, the chances of her reading this are slim to none, so I will elaborate.  We got a limo and are going to hang around uptown. Aimee loves rockin music so I am sure we will go dancing – the limo doesn’t even come til eleven, so we will play games, have drinks, etc.  I was asked to bring panties, haha funny word, that represented me…  Girls are silly aren’t they?  Aimee will have to guess who they are from.  I couldn’t really find any that were dead on “me”, but I think I got close: Black lacey briefs with red bows on the hips.  Those will be fun for Steve….and your welcome. They get hitched end of July – and I’m in it – love to see these two folks together.  He is 34 and she is 24 – but you would never be able to tell.  I desire the camaraderie they have.  God’s will thankfully.  Steve is a great guy. His humor is totally him.  Get this, he named his stomach after his uncle….Kenny. He is an avid fisherman, so two thumbs up.  They are trying to buy a house; I hope they come out my direction.  Progressive dinner anyone? Joke.

      You know what they say, blog sweet blog. Here is my first one.   Now that I have one, being a marketing and advertising genius I am going to let everyone know about my blog so they can add their two cents. Cross my fingers.   When I look at that word 'genius'...well it looks wrong. If I were webster I would spell it genious. There are a lot of words that look wrong to me. Maybe I am not a genious.   Anyways, I would like to welcome you to Club Cav. Pull up a chair, put your dancing shoes on and stay tuned.

       urlLink    I am thinking about getting lasik. Here are some interesting facts:  The external muscles that move the eyes are the strongest muscles in the human body for the job that they have to do. They are 100 times more powerful than they need to be. In a normal life-span, eyes will bring you almost 24 million images of the world around you. Eyes utilize 65% of all the pathways to the brain. Under the right conditions, eyes can discern the light of a candle at a distance of 14 miles. Eyes can process 36,000 bits of information every hour. Eyes are composed of more than two million working parts. And they are the most complex organs you possess except for your brain.  I have a black speck in one of my eyes. Not very many people know it, but I was once told it was a sign for something. Anyone know?  urlLink

American by birth.&nbsp;My friend&nbsp;brought her friends from her international MBA program&nbsp;- and these cats were really cool. Spanish, French and Mexican.&nbsp; Since I will be traveling in September I found some good places to go.  We had some interesting talks about theology, samba dancing and chicken curry. The exhibit was ok but I just like going to the dma because it is structurely awesome. Did I mention my crush&nbsp;is an architect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyways, the lines are really clean, modern and natural stone.

      So I have a date tonight, no not with the crush, but with some friends. Going to the  urlLink DMA .&nbsp; I always love going there on Thursday nights; live jazz music, drinks, silent auctions,&nbsp;free exhibitions.&nbsp; Something about live great music brings the art alive - kind of like a great glass of red wine with a medium cooked steak.   I want to see Bearden's work. He grew up in Harlem...His&nbsp;painting have a lot of stories&nbsp;and have seen a lot of eyes.&nbsp; The Jazz will bring them to life.   I have not painted in a long time, well because the stupid excuse of being busy.&nbsp; Since I have moved home, I do not have the room and I have not made it out to any studios. Once I get moved in I will have a whole room.&nbsp; It will be nice.   Not very many people know I can paint.&nbsp; I don't tell anyone, but I don't mean it to be a secret. To be good at it, like anything, you have to do it all the time, practice.&nbsp; I really feel that I have gotten behind.&nbsp; It is like running a 5k when you haven't worked out in a long time - you strain and your movements are not controlled.   I also love sculpture.&nbsp; Something about building a beautiful object from hand it amazing, did i mention my crush is an architect?

      The VH1 show from ‘A to Z’ has inspired me to do the following about myself in third person.&nbsp; For those who do not know the show, they take a certain someone and&nbsp;discuss random details from their life from A to Z....&nbsp;  &nbsp;  A is for Adrenaline  She is always&nbsp;game for a good adrenaline rush. She finds these&nbsp;rushes in live sport games,&nbsp;spur-of-the momment trips,&nbsp;big fish, good conversations&nbsp;and driving too fast with the top down. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  B is for Bra  Lauren hated puberty and for some reason was embarrassed about the whole thing. She did not want to wear, discuss, or even think of the word ‘bra’. Once shopping, her mom had blackmailed her into coming to the lingerie department.&nbsp; Once there, she called for the lady to ‘measure’ her daughter. In an act of rage, demon possession and astonishment, Lauren kicked her mother in the shin.&nbsp; She was grounded for a week and made to wear bras for the rest of her life.  &nbsp;  C is for Ceiling Fan.  As a child in the eighties, Lauren had an affinity for acting out Star Wars, the movie,&nbsp;with her older brother.&nbsp; They had attached a rope to the ceiling fan and tied it around their wastes in attempt to jump from the banister to the couch. Yes, they were reenacting the Return of the Jedi scene where Luke and Leia would jump from one sand hovercraft to the other in effort to avoid the ‘sand monster’ – which was identified as the 'carpet'. They were unsuccessful however; crashing down and bringing the ceiling fan along with them.&nbsp; Mom could never trust Lauren with a ceiling fan again. Never.  &nbsp;  D is for Dimples  Her&nbsp;parents always wanted a daughter with dimples,&nbsp;they prayed, and got Lauren. She&nbsp;can’t go anywhere with out someone commenting. She is an eternal cabbage patch kid. Her office has a mirror wall and sometimes she finds herself looking at it while she is on the phone and starts laughing because she doesn’t realize they show with every syllable pronounced.&nbsp; Her coworkers see her doing this and think she is vain and make fun of her. Funny.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  E is for Easter.  It is her favorite holiday and many times, has fallen on her bday.  &nbsp;  F is for Fall  No not Autumn leaves Fall, but fall, as in, on your face.&nbsp; Lauren things falling is&nbsp; hilarious.&nbsp; It can be anyone, but it is especially great when it is her or someone she knows. Lauren is graceful and light on her feet, but sometimes she is in too quick of a hurry and trips and falls, only to find her laughing on the floor. Leave her there until she quits.  &nbsp;  G is for Gleek  She can gleek, she is like a snake with venom.&nbsp; Not very lady like, but how intriguing, yes? Rrright.  &nbsp;  H is for Heaven  It is a sure thing.&nbsp; Her name is in the book.&nbsp; She is going, going, gone.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I is for Idiosyncrasies  Lauren has several habits that have formed over the years.&nbsp; She winks at people. Driving, at the bar, at church, in pictures,&nbsp;you name it. Chronic winker. She also pops her shoulders, twirls her hair and&nbsp;bites her bottom lip. &nbsp;   J is for Juicy Fruit  Again, as a child – she could not quite get the vernacular of the English language. Her favorite gum at the age of 3 was not in fact juicy fruit, but juicy poot. Her parents still to this day, love pointing that out.  &nbsp;  K is for Kiss  Her first kiss is worth mentioning.&nbsp; After snow cones and flash light tag at dusk with the ‘boy next door’, Lauren found herself listening to classic rock. A song called “strangle hold” came on and he started kissing &nbsp;her, how romantic. Lauren has now come to find out that song is by Ted Nugent-even more&nbsp;romantic. Still to this day, she thinks that long guitar solo is worth a make out session.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  L is for Laughing  She thinks there is nothing better than a huge laugh. Laugh, meaning in terms of&nbsp;the noun not the verb. She loves it when it leaves her hurting and gasping.&nbsp; She is a SCL. Silent clapping laugher.&nbsp; Lauren is a silent laugher; she makes no noise when she laughs. Lauren is a clapper, when she is laughing or finds something funny, she proceeds to clap. You may know other SCL’s.&nbsp;   M is for Mountains  Although she thinks the ocean can be nice, Lauren loves the mountains. Everything that goes along with them she loves:&nbsp; trees, mtn. streams, animals, the air, river, skiing,&nbsp; high altitude, trout…also men don’t always shave there – she likes a fresh cut, but loves 5 o’clock shadow.&nbsp;Bring the stubble on.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  N stands for night.  She is a night owl.&nbsp; She&nbsp;has been known to stay up and watch Conan O'Brien&nbsp;and then read a book.  &nbsp;  O is for Octopussy  Thats her favorite bond girl. Joke.&nbsp;&nbsp;O is for one, because&nbsp;she believes in one true love. Ahh.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  P is for&nbsp;&nbsp;pooper scooper.  She has to use one all the time so her neighbors won't turn her in and get her a ticket from the dog home owner association nazis.&nbsp;&*%$&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Q is for Queso.  She loves spicy food and can always handle a bowl of chips, salsa and queso.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  R is for Read&nbsp;  Lauren reads a lot. Too&nbsp;much sometimes.&nbsp;She doesnt like fiction, but she will read history, theology, law, politics and humor... She is a gulf of endless knowledge - self proclaimed of course.  &nbsp;  S is for Sleep  Lauren is recently the new owner of a townhouse, however it has rained so much, it is behind on construction. So rather than extending her lease, she has moved home to save some cash – but it is at the expense of her sleep.&nbsp; She doesn’t get much and when she does, it is not good.&nbsp; Her mattress is in storage, so now she has to sleep on a hard queen with her heat radiating dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  T is for Teeth and Telluride  Lauren loves great teeth to the point she sometimes fixates on them when someone is talking. White, straight teeth…she is admittedly a teeth snob, a tooth snob? &nbsp;&nbsp;As for Telluride,&nbsp;she had family out&nbsp;there and she would like to live there.&nbsp; She should get to know some dentists in telluride.  &nbsp;  U stands for Under  She believes and is for One Nation Under God and she likes underwear and Australia. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  V is for&nbsp;Vu  As in deja vu.&nbsp; She doens't dream often, but when she does, it&nbsp;always ends up happening in her reality.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  W is for wisenhiemer. She is very sarcastic to the point some do not get her humor.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  X is for Xtreme&nbsp;language&nbsp;  In conversing and getting tongue tied, she has made Xtreme language. She takes two words and makes a new one.&nbsp; Two of her more famous words are&nbsp;'wenis' and 'idiass'.&nbsp;&nbsp;weasel and penis.&nbsp;&nbsp; idiot and ass.&nbsp; They are best used together:&nbsp;Kyle is an idiass wenis when he does that.  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Y is for YES!  Oui, ja, si, sim, yes is her favorite word.&nbsp; Yes yes yes!   Z is for zapatos.  She can speak spanish and she likes shoes.

      Work has been incredibly busy, in a good way I guess.&nbsp; I am really looking forward to Europe. Drinking vino, seeing friends and walking. Yes, just walking.&nbsp; I love that, I can go for days.&nbsp; Looking at sites, churches, statues, people, window shopping…  I will be staying in my friend’s loft which I will really enjoy.&nbsp; I am not a big fan of hotels because they are not easy access.&nbsp; You have to walk through the lobby and such.&nbsp; I always like renting out a place because it feels more like home and you can have more people over for a longer amount of time. Plus it is Parisian style. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I will be attending a  urlLink French wedding .&nbsp; I hear they are events unto themselves.&nbsp; It is a huge part of the cultural.&nbsp; I can already see the wedding party walking down the cobblestone streets of  urlLink Tropez , similar to pacino in the godfather. Je ne peux pas attendre !&nbsp; It will be so nice to see old friends.&nbsp; Friends that I have not seen a couple years. &nbsp;People are coming from all&nbsp;over.  &nbsp;  It’s the best when you see old friends and you pick up like no time has passed.  &nbsp;  May I blab for a bit? Thanks.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My friend dropped by the shoes for the wedding.&nbsp; I like heels, but these are 3.5 inches tall.&nbsp; I am at least 5’9. &nbsp;I can already see me being taller than all the groomsmen.&nbsp; Lovely.  I have never dated anyone shorter than I am.&nbsp; It has always just ended up that way. I will look like a celery stalk walking down the isle.&nbsp; The wedding will be fun, I love these people.  &nbsp;  Let’s just hope the plane ride will not be crazy.&nbsp; After reading today’s news I am quazi concerned.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Just in from peeing in my pants (well, not really) from laughing so hard.  For the last several weeks, once a week, I have been meeting up with my French friend, Julie (pronounced Shoolee), for lunch.  By the end of the lunch, I swear, we appear drunk by our laughter and our actions - but we are anything of the sort.    In vision two young tall female professionals in suit attire all the while executives all around are having their power lunches and discussions about their 401k’s and on going litigations. Thirty minutes into the meal we become zany and incoherent of anything around us. The thing that T’d me off today was this fly bussing around our table. I have to say it was ‘bugging’ me, so it needed to be killed off.  So I swing/snapped my napkin (like a towel in a locker room) at it and almost hit a lady’s head. Had to be there.   Next thing you know Julie is going off about her wedding (in St. Tropez – going to in September) and how the French Consulate have messed up her papers.  Note I thought she said convolute, we ended up calling her Consult. I enjoy hearing her talk, because I always have to end up clarifying what she said and in return she tells me it in French. I have a mean French impression that even has her stunned although it is not comprehensible – I may try it out on you sometime. Oui, oui?   Julie and I went to college together and her first year in the USA was her freshman year. Combine freshman year mentality (although I was mature) and a girl that doesn’t know American slag and you get a game I know as…Guess what this means/here’s a word for...  Olivia: Julie, your last name sounds like boner.  (small laughter) Julie: Vout doos tat mean? Cav:  You lived in Paris, so you saw the Eiffel tower, right?   Yes, she comes to America and she gets a nickname that is a bodily function. Let’s call it a tradeoff.  So yeah, I am guilty of teaching her trashy vernacular, but hey, she needed to know. She is now marrying an American man. You have got to love America and quazi southern ivy league educations – you meet great people and ‘learn’ all the important stuff.  Back to the lunch – she drives like a mad woman in her lex…so when she slows down to look at something you know something it up.    Julie: Tat looked like a cut oof arm... Cav: What about the alarm? Julie: (shows with action, a cut off arm) I swear I just saw an arm. Looks like an arm with fingers. Cav: Well, heck turn back around and lets go look.   Turns around...  Julie and Cav: (Laughter)  Cav: It is just rolled up frayed carpet.  Maybe Julie was drunk, you never know, she is French.

Yes, I know 'alot' is not one word, but two. On this blog it will be one.   So, donnot tel me I'ev speelled some thing rong. I all ready know these.

      I got this in an email and thought it was funny because it won't happen, but having thought about some of the facts is discusses, I could see how it could be true in one way or any other. This will ruffle some feathers maybe.  For those of you who don't live in Texas and want to move here, come on, we have plenty of room for you.   If Kerry is elected President:  After listening to all the gloating in the press and seeing the liberal whiners along the inauguration route, the folks from Texas would probably decide to take matters into their own hands.     To wit:    #1: If he gets elected, let Kerry become President of the 49 United States.    #2: Texas will SECEDE FROM THE UNION asguaranteed by our right to do so when we joined the Union.   #3: George W. Bush becomes the President of the Republic of Texas.   Will we survive as a Republic? Well, let's see... NASA's in Houston (so, we basically control the space industry).     85% of the gasoline in the United States is refined in Texas City.     Over 65% of the defense industry is located here. (The term "DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS" would take on a whole new meaning.)  Oil - we can supply all the oil that the Republic of Texas will need for the next 300 years.   Natural Gas - Again we have all we need. Maybe we'll sell some to Mr. Kerry.     Computer Industry -  HP, Texas Instruments, Dell, Compaq, EDS, Raytheon, National Semiconductor, Motorola,Intel, AMD, Atmel,Applied Materials, Ball Semiconductor, Dallas Semiconductor, Delphi, Nortel... All located and headquartered here.   Health Care - We have the largest research centers for Cancer research, the best burn centers and the top trauma units in the world.   Education -  Between U.T., Texas A&M, TexasTech, Rice, TCU, SMU, University of Houston, Baylor, University of North Texas, and Texas Women's University we ought to be covered.  Ivy grows better in the south anyway. Not to mention 5 medical schools.   Labor - Lots of workers here (and just open theborder when we need some more)   We have control of the paper industry,plastics, insurance, etc.  Defense - In case of a foreign invasion, we have the Texas National Guard and the Texas Air National Guard.  Agriculture - We are totally self sufficient in beef, poultry, hogs, chickens and vegetable produce.  *Gotta mention that we have an abundant supply of the best-looking ladies in the whole world. And any snide remarks about our women being "corn fed" will get your butt kicked--by our women!) We have Faith in God as our Supreme Creator and Savior. Texas will have "In God We Trust" on the front and back of its own money. Texas will have prayers at all sporting events. Texans will have the Ten Commandments posted where ever they want. Each school day will be opened with prayer. We've got mountains. We've got beaches. East Texas is forest. West Texas is desert.   There isn't a thing out there that we need and don't have. Now to the rest of The United States under President Kerry : God bless you all...truly...and good luck!       Signed, The Citizens of "The Republic of Texas"

       urlLink    Have you been able to see the 'hidden picture'. My friends, that is a bunch of bull dicky. I have never been able to see anything in these pictures.  I think it is a big marketing fad sham, similar to a pet rock, where people want to make money. I have stared at these posters, mostly in the 90's at my friend's houses (I would never own one - too psychodelic crazy for my sophisticated jr high school room that was a sports trophy shrine which I had created for any entering guest to see. Plus my mom the designer/snob said no. I love you mom.) Note: Post college, I have since given these trophies to Goodwill. Having just stated that, I ask myself why?  That is a good question to ask yourself - What would a homeless or less fortunate person do with several first place volleyball trophies? Sell them? For drugs? Oh, what have I done!?   Anyways, back to the poster - yes, it is a sham I have decided. Or people who smoke the illegal substances made them up to go on their naughty trips to escape the world - wake up buddies, no escaping.  You really shouldn't do that stuff, it has a snow balling effect, next thing you know you are peddeling second hand, first place trophies on the side of the road.    &nbsp; urlLink

      I wish it wouldn't be weird to date a friends old boyfriend IF the break up was mutual and on good terms. Why do people have to be so weird about that? Life's too short.  Anyways - I am a "sexy minx" as I was told that at a bar by some guy whom I will probably never see again, since he has moved to go back to grad school.  Funny to think that he and I - if I accepted - would be going to the same school, living in the same time. Life's too short to think about that. What is a minx?  A fox? Is it even an animal...  I am in a wedding next week and the dress - that I had to buy - is 400, plus alterations - I will never wear it again. Thanks a lot Stanley Korshak.   Also, there are 14 bridesmaids.

      I think it is odd that I know two, and potentially three people who have been on reality TV shows.  First being Shannon - I went to church with her growing up - She was on the first bachelor and every other special about it.  Wow, thats something to be proud of.  I saw her in Dallas at a party after the hoop-la and she was "pretty cool" -wink wink.  Second, there is P.J.  who recently won For Love or For Money - I met her while being in my brother's wedding - they went to college together - so watching this was quite funny.  Note, she broke up with her boyfriend here in Dallas to move to LA to do that show bc "God told her to" - hmm.  And then, Clay - who has been asked out to LA by producers... He went in for the interview and they were like well...thats it - if you don't have anything interesting to tell about yourself, then it was nice meeting you.  Clay:  "Well I am a 25 yr old virgin." Producers: Gasp with delight and titillation of the story line...  Oh clay, clay, clay - my sweet friend - do not let the rest of the world tease you over this. Depending on the type of reality show, he may not be a virgin much longer. gee.  He seems not to care though, he hates his job and thinks it would be interesting.    I will keep you postedd

      At work, I get vendors bringing me gifts a lot - tickets, free lunch at so and so, coffee tumblers, etc.  Well, in the office today was a box of  urlLink jelly belly  specialty beans.  So, I grabbed a few and went about my business popping them in my mouth every now and then.    Ya know, when I think jelly beans, I think cherry, lime, cotton candy, ya know fruity flavors - ha.    A very odd flavor came across my taste buds.  I spit it out - green. SO I went to go see what flavor I had gotten.  There were several greens to choose from: lime, watermelon, sour apple, etc. To make sure, I took each one and ate it however not experiencing the nastiness.  Then I see it, yes, jalepeno flavored jelly beans. Poor little jalepeno jelly bean - such an outcast.  Everyone else is being eaten.    Ok, I love spicy food - in fact I can eat peppers by themselves.  I will however not eat them with a candy coated shell.  Yes, I just wasted a blog discussing these.

      Here is something I wanted to share. Worth the read.  "For one who was born and grew up in the small towns of the Midwest, there is a special kind of nostalgia about the Fourth of July.  I remember it as a day almost as long-anticipated as Christmas. This was helped along by the appearance in store windows of all kinds of fireworks and colorful posters advertising them with vivid pictures.  No later than the third of July – sometimes earlier – Dad would bring home what he felt he could afford to see go up in smoke and flame. We'd count and recount the number of firecrackers, display pieces and other things and go to bed determined to be up with the sun so as to offer the first, thunderous notice of the Fourth of July.  I'm afraid we didn't give too much thought to the meaning of the day. And, yes, there were tragic accidents to mar it, resulting from careless handling of the fireworks. I'm sure we're better off today with fireworks largely handled by professionals. Yet there was a thrill never to be forgotten in seeing a tin can blown 30 feet in the air by a giant "cracker" – giant meaning it was about 4 inches long.  But enough of nostalgia. Somewhere in our growing up we began to be aware of the meaning of days and with that awareness came the birth of patriotism. July Fourth is the birthday of our nation. I believed as a boy, and believe even more today, that it is the birthday of the greatest nation on earth.  There is a legend about the day of our nation's birth in the little hall in Philadelphia, a day on which debate had raged for hours. The men gathered there were honorable men hard-pressed by a king who had flouted the very laws they were willing to obey. Even so, to sign the Declaration of Independence was such an irretrievable act that the walls resounded with the words "treason, the gallows, the headsman's axe," and the issue remained in doubt.  The legend says that at that point a man rose and spoke. He is described as not a young man, but one who had to summon all his energy for an impassioned plea. He cited the grievances that had brought them to this moment and finally, his voice falling, he said, "They may turn every tree into a gallows, every hole into a grave, and yet the words of that parchment can never die. To the mechanic in the workshop, they will speak hope; to the slave in the mines, freedom. Sign that parchment. Sign if the next moment the noose is around your neck, for that parchment will be the textbook of freedom, the Bible of the rights of man forever."  He fell back exhausted. The 56 delegates, swept up by his eloquence, rushed forward and signed that document destined to be as immortal as a work of man can be. When they turned to thank him for his timely oratory, he was not to be found, nor could any be found who knew who he was or how he had come in or gone out through the locked and guarded doors.  Well, that is the legend. But we do know for certain that 56 men, a little band so unique we have never seen their like since, had pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor. Some gave their lives in the war that followed, most gave their fortunes, and all preserved their sacred honor.  What manner of men were they? Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists, 11 were merchants and tradesmen, and nine were farmers. They were soft-spoken men of means and education; they were not an unwashed rabble. They had achieved security but valued freedom more. Their stories have not been told nearly enough.  John Hart was driven from the side of his desperately ill wife. For more than a year he lived in the forest and in caves before he returned to find his wife dead, his children vanished, his property destroyed. He died of exhaustion and a broken heart.  Carter Braxton of Virginia lost all his ships, sold his home to pay his debts, and died in rags. And so it was with Ellery, Clymer, Hall, Walton, Gwinnett, Rutledge, Morris, Livingston and Middleton.  Nelson personally urged Washington to fire on his home and destroy it when it became the headquarters for General Cornwallis. Nelson died bankrupt.  But they sired a nation that grew from sea to shining sea. Five million farms, quiet villages, cities that never sleep, 3 million square miles of forest, field, mountain and desert, 227 million people with a pedigree that includes the bloodlines of all the world.  In recent years, however, I've come to think of that day as more than just the birthday of a nation.  It also commemorates the only true philosophical revolution in all history.  Oh, there have been revolutions before and since ours. But those revolutions simply exchanged one set of rules for another. Ours was a revolution that changed the very concept of government.  Let the Fourth of July always be a reminder that here in this land, for the first time, it was decided that man is born with certain God-given rights; that government is only a convenience created and managed by the people, with no powers of its own except those voluntarily granted to it by the people.  We sometimes forget that great truth, and we never should.  Happy Fourth of July.  Ronald Reagan President of the United States  I think we take it for granted - our american heritage. We are blessed. We have become discredit due to  the media - muy mal propaganda. If you don't like it, leave I say. As for me, I'm proud to be an American.  And a Texan - ha. Had to add that in.

      So, I have been house sitting for my brother.  It's a fairly new house but it has domed ceilings, and it is darn big and when you are there by yourself everything echoes. I think my mind was playing tricks on me because I swear doors kept coming open that I didn't open etc. So I ended up sleeping on the couch in the den. I also got freaked out because my cell kept going off and I could never remember where I put it - but since the house echoed it sounded like it could be anywhere.     They have two dogs - Daisy the  urlLink Gordon setter  and Trixie the pit bull chow mix.  All daisy wants me to do it throw the ball down the long hall and all Trixie wants me to do is pet and love on her.    Between the echoing, door opening, dogs...I didn't get much sleep last night.

      Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit daa ya dada yaa a then a dad ado da a a.  Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit daaa doo dad dada dooo do daad daaa then I see the look in your eyes. Turn around, bright eyes. Every now and then I fall apart Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart – and I need you now tonight…. And I need you more than eva…    Funny, that’s a great song to belt out -  Gotta love  urlLink Frank the Tank .   Luke Wilson is good looking.  I have seen him in Dallas once when he was dating G. Paltrow - at  urlLink Whole Earth Provisions .  He is an attractive man, once again it was the jaw line.  I would think I could be friends with Owen and Luke – we have the same humor – at least as it appears to me in movies and interviews.    Another person I saw several times when I lived in uptown was Steve Nash.  urlLink Go Mavs .  I saw him at some neighborhood pubs and drivin’ around in his Mercedes.  We looked at each other, there was a connection. I am not so much attracted to him, but I love true athletic ability.   But that will never be – today he signed a 60 million dollar contract two with the suns.  But wait, alas, I my have a chance; my sister in law’s cousin owns 50% of the suns. I will have to fly out to Phoenix.  Anyways, too bad for the Mavs, I would have liked another season to watch Dirk and Nash.  The gossip is that we will get Shaq. Hmm.  Today was another revealing day at work. Another VP was let go.  Good guy, hard worker – but gots to do whats best for the company and for the VC’s. Go Team.  That’s enough of that. I am excited to see where things go.  I locked in the interest rate for my house Monday – good thing because Greenspan upped the antie or is it the annie.  Why don’t I know that?  I wish it would stop raining here so they can finish the house.    As I watch this movie, everyone is so scared about being with the same woman/man forever.  I think that is awesome, being with one person –  forever. As for me, I can't give my heart to a lot of people, messes with my head. Plus there is no better a gift than to give someone yourself totally and eternally.  BUT where the problem comes in, is that you have to search the right one out – continual disappointments and sadness – but hope is an awesome thing.  Plus it keeps things interesting.    I need to go to sleep.

      Another thing to admit, I listen to talk radio on the way home from work AND I am only 24, call me an old soul.  They were discussing the election and brought up a great point that I agree with...   Here are the five questions that I believe could save America. Answer these questions honestly...memorize them...ask them of your friends:  1. Do you believe there are people in the world who want to destroy our country and our way of life?  2. Do you believe they would do it if they could?  3. Do you believe they can be stopped?  4. Do you want them to be stopped?  5. Who do you think is more capable and willing to stop those who seek to destroy us: John Kerry or George W. Bush?  Answers to those questions will tell you alot. I believe the answer to each of them is obvious. Healthcare, SS, taxes, etc are important - BUT those issues don't matter when people's lives are lost - it is about being protected and surviving.  It was good to think about.

      is no more. I must mourn the perfect black high heel pump.  I know it is stupid and it is JUST a shoe, but I spent a pretty penny on them knowing I would get some good wear on them. It had the perfect toe and the perfect heel, the perfect comfort and the perfect leather.  My eight year old jealous dog chewed it to hell. My seventy-five pound, going grey, gordon freaking setter ripped my precious to shreds.  She has done this before, not to shoes...to my perfect sunglasses. After that I decided not to buy nice sunglasses.  Yes, eight years old. She knows better. But she gets these jealous fits of rage when I close her into my bedroom and play with the new puppy. Sigh, yes I probably would get jealous too, but I would never go for the shoe. gasp.  So now, I just have half a perfect pair. Yes, I know what my dog was thinking upon seeing them. "HahAAA, ruff, She wears these all the time. I will chew ONE so she can at least have one to remind her to never lock me out!"  So lesson learned, never leave my shoes on the floor. But I think, "I leave my shoes out all the time and she doesn't chew them. Why these Devil dog, why theeeeeeeeeeeeeese!"  I still love my dog. She and I had a talk about it, I showed her to the shoe. She was embarrassed and cried and wouldn't eat until I loved on her.  Maybe I will just use the one shoe as a planter or if I ever break my right foot, I can wear  that  one. Dang it!

      Mo j ito, Lemon 43, water, port, salsa/chips, chicken, stories of love and laughter. Dinner was good as always. Cuban this time. We ended up staying again for after dinner drinks. These were after the pre dinner and dinner drinks. Our tolerance is up, not even tipsy. Or were we?  I love them. We have been through thick and thin. Death and life. Pain and satisfaction. We always pick up where we leave off. I’ve poured myself out to them and they to me. They know me, but they don’t  know me . I am different from them. After all these years. Doesn’t mean I view myself better or worse. It is what it is, I feel it, and I am. I see things differently. It is an interminable and panoramic view. I am in the moment, yet I am separate; I understand yet there is an even larger detail to comprehend. Maybe they feel the same way, feeling different. An on looker may see me as the same, but my heart is different. I see myself as an old soul. My distinction is a subtle, but it is eternal. It is written on my heart. I am different. I don’t mind, I am thankful for the distinction.  On my way home after the night, I call each of them, individually. I make them feel. I tell them they are special, not to worry about the issue of the day and that I am blessed. Blessed to have them and just thanks….thanks.  But where. Where is my call on my way home. I want to  feel .  I love. It is what I do. It’s why I am here. I learn when I love.   If I could love the way you love me. If your word, in my heart, was the only thing I used to fill me up. I want to place my feet where wounded walk, and where you learn to love no matter the cost. I want to go, I want to walk your road.   I am walking that road, learning that love. Can be a narrow path; Real love. When you love no matter what, you run the risk. To love is to be wounded. I am wounded because I am different. Because I see. Because I wait. Because I am. I am wounded because I love.  Being wounded creates beauty. Beauty of the heart.  ‘Ladidadida It’s the snoop d-o-double g. turn that shat up.’  This very moment I am making some cd’s for my friend’s move. All different tunes, because thats what I got - I like it all..  I have had some guys make me some cd’s. Sweet easy gifts. I think it tells a lot about a person. Choosing music tells ya about a person or maybe I read too much into it. I have been known to be analytical.  “You can do it, put your back into it.” – Ice Cube I can dance like a black woman to this song. Fun, reminds me of college.  “Fooled around and fell in love” – Elvin Bishop Ha - love that song. . “something” - the beatles dang sexy, kiss me  “please forgive me” –bryan adams loved this song back in the day, kiss me  “tell me something good” – Shaka Khan aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah, sing it sister. Bring it.  “dirty laundry” – don Henley I remember my mom blasting this  “someone saved my life tonight” – Elton john I can belt this song, sugar bear.  “all right now” – free could possible be my theme song, always gets me going, played very loud.  “whiter shade of pale” –moody blues reminds me of summer, classic  “maybe im amazed” – paul mccartney reminds me of todd dammit  “creep” – radiohead played very loud, great song to run to.  “Beast of burden” –rolling stones prty prty prty prty prty, love the stones.  “Cry to me” – Soloman Burke Ahh yeah, bring it on baby. Cry to me and lets make out and then some.  “Take a load of annie” – the band feel good song, on the back porch with a beer.  “whose gonna drive you home” - the cars top down on car, driving, trying to feel sorry for myself, but never seems to work  “Mysterious Ways” – U2 I always try to contort my body into weird positions, did I mention I can do the robot really good. I mean good enough to get paid.  “I know what you want” –buster rhymes jean grinding music  “dirty” – Christina Aguilera something empowering about this song, can’t put my finger on it.  “Hypnotized” – Nitorious BIG ha, this song makes me laugh, but I can hit it wid’it.  “Can’t deny it” - Fabulous w/ Nate dogg I am again a black woman when I hear this song, I go into a transe and the butt dance comes out.  “Get it on tonight“ Montel Jordon Don’t be deceived by the singer, this is a good and sexy song. Play it loud.  “here in the real word” – alan Jackson classic country ballad, good to sing the chorus to.  “Amarillo by morning” – George Strait Sing it george, sing it.  “hey good looking” – hank Williams Cracks me up, but you got to love it. So retro.  “take me home country road” john Denver never lived in the country, but man, take me john Denver, take me with this song.  “50 dollars and a glass of crown” – Bleu Edmondson band This just makes ya wanna paint the town. Better live.  “Baby’s got blue jeans on” – Mell mcdaniel this just makes me want to have a cow bell and priss around in blue jeans.  “Louisiana Saturday Night” – mell mcdaniel I don’t know, but this song cracks me up, but at the same time very endearing, if a song can in fact be endearing.  “Your lying cheaten heart” – patty loveless This is like ‘the finger’ song  I’ll still be loving you” –restless heart Just a damn good love song, old school style  “hears a quarter. Call someone who cares” – travis tritt in your face sucker *(&amp;^(*%.  Name some songs and how they make you feel....

      1. Name five things in your refrigerator.  2. One random thing you like.  3. Name three things around your computer.  4. Name five things in the trunk of your car.

      either you get it or you don't Our natural inclination is to be so precise— trying always to forecast accurately what will happen next—that we look upon uncertainty as a bad thing. We think that we must reach some predetermined goal, but that is not the nature of the spiritual life. The nature of the spiritual life is that we are certain in our uncertainty. Consequently, we do not put down roots. Our common sense says, "Well, what if I were in that circumstance?" We cannot presume to see ourselves in any circumstance in which we have never been. Certainty is the mark of the commonsense life—gracious uncertainty is the mark of the spiritual life. To be certain of God means that we are uncertain in all our ways, not knowing what tomorrow may bring. This is generally expressed with a sigh of sadness, but it should be an expression of breathless expectation. We are uncertain of the next step, but we are certain of God. As soon as we abandon ourselves to God and do the task He has placed closest to us, He begins to fill our lives with surprises. When we become simply a promoter or a defender of a particular belief, something within us dies. That is not believing God — it is only believing our belief about Him. Jesus said, ". . . unless you . . . become as little children . . ." ( urlLink  Matthew 18:3  ). The spiritual life is the life of a child. We are not uncertain of God, just uncertain of what He is going to do next. If our certainty is only in our beliefs, we develop a sense of self-righteousness, become overly critical, and are limited by the view that our beliefs are complete and settled. But when we have the right relationship with God, life is full of spontaneous, joyful uncertainty and expectancy. Jesus said, ". . . believe also in Me" ( urlLink  John 14:1  ), not, "Believe certain things about Me". Leave everything to Him and it will be gloriously and graciously uncertain how He will come in—but you can be certain that He will come. Remain faithful to Him.  . . . it has not yet been revealed what we shall be . . . —1 John 3:2

       urlLink    Trying to take a picture of ourselves again waiting on the valet, probably tooki 10.  Not a very good picture of us, hot and greasy, but I wanted to say I had a good time.  I will go to a Fire Side any time. Lots of laughs from old relationships, mens bathroom, shower heads in Italy, and the best damn cheesecake ever.  Te amo.   urlLink

      And let me tell you, sometimes you don't. Oh man. I bought some raw almonds last week from whole foods and I had been grabbing a hand full every now and then.  So yesterday, coming back from the weekend, I decided to get some. I grabbed the bag they were in and I notice they look a little different, namely they looked as though that had been eaten by tiny miniature squirrels or beavers. I am talking the size of a thimbles, little teeth marks and everything. The raw almond exterior looked as though it had been pealed, by a peeler.  So, being the scientific person I am, I put some placebo almonds out to see if they would be disturbed, and discarded all the bad almonds in the bag. I came back today and the placebo almonds were undisturbed, but the almonds in the bag were yes, chewed on. Ah gross.  I couldn't not find the mircobeavers, but alas, they must be nocturnal. Yes, I know what you are thinking. They live inside the almonds during the day.  Anyways, I am grossed out, I have been eating almonds with worms or bugs or something in them. Sad thing is, I also may have killed some petite rodents.

      Answer my questions:  1. Whats your name?  2. If you had to describe yourself on a shirt and wear it around everyday, what would it say on the front?  3. What would it say on the back?  4. If you had 1 buck for everytime you did something, what would that something be?

      I have been pretty nostaglic the last few weeks, hence the pictures. But things are changing and a new time is coming around the corner. Which isn't bad, but I am sure I wouldn't feel this way if we didnt have the times we did.   It came sooo fast.  In 5 more years I will be thirty - that is quite funny to me, yet exciting. I can remember starting high school like yesterday and with in that same amount of time, from then till now - I will be what I view as middle aged. HA. So much to do, so much to see, so much! adventure!  This really wasn't worth writing about, but it was on my heart...
