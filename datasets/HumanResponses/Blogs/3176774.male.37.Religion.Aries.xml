      The early hours are closing in on me.  I have done nothing with this site.  As far as I know it gets no visitors save for those wanders who hit the right search term..  I'm going to change things around.  See if I can take it back.  Take it for myself.  Forget what I was trying to do.  Number one I wasn't trying very hard and #2 others are doing it much better than screencue was.  So take it back.  Maybe you can start blogging stuff that matters to you.  Don't be afraid.  Its not like anyone will read it anyway.  I look at these sites that take a stand.  I need to follow their lead.  You have to take a stand.  So a redesign is on its way.

      is as it should be.  A trip to the supermarket to see an incredible raven haired beauty and tempt her to catch my eye.  Alas to no avail.  I returned home with skim milk, a box of flakes and a few apples.  The apples were pink ladies.

      Steavie stands in for the actors who don't make it to rehearsal for one reason or another.  Now don't start any nasty rumors.  We are on track.  It will all come together.  We just need to get upstairs.  Yeah I had big plans for screencue. But it takes much work and I am basically not interested in a lot of extra work.  Just give me money.

      Rev G in the House!! The last rendition of ScreenCue was okay, but you are right, that info was out there already. I like this blog stuff. I was going to start one for the classes I teach at OKCCC but I don't really want to put that much time into it. So...seen any good hail lately. Those pics were amazing! Off the subject...what does Stevie do at rehearsals? And lastly, how does a duck pay for lip balm?  Later

      You say you liked the site as it was.  I have a feeling you were its only visitor.  I am not sure it offered any useful information that is not already available through someone else's mailing list.

      You're right. I'm not a sister. I think? Oh great, now I'm not sure. The old ScreenCue was in my favorites so I decided to take a visit. Low and behold a new, completely different ScreenCue had been placed here. If I'm intruding, please feel free to take all my privileges away. :)

      It seems someone has joined the family forum.  Someone who is not a sister.  Well they could be a sister.  I mean you can never be 100 % sure of anything.  Perhaps I should give this person blogging rights.  It might make for some interesting content.

      Is spelling an indication of ones intelligence.  If it is I am stupid.  I mean stupid.  Arts fest this week.  Eye appointment on Monday.  Maybe I will be able to see for a change.  I have broken the 200 barrier for a week now.  Keep on.  I should use the spell checker.  It will save face.  Will people forget how to spell because of spell checker?

      Rev G, so sorry I did not make it to poker.  The other kids started getting a bit tips and the conversation changed to sex.  Before I knew it it was the witching hour and I turned into something otherworldly.  Don't count me out on the next poker.

      I remember well.  I was dragging my canoe down the Allegheny River, when suddenly I was attacked by a thousand savages.  I pulled out my trusty bowie knife and carved a path through a wall of human flesh, all the while dragging my canoe behind me.

      The duck walks into the drug store, gets some lip balm, walks up to the counter and the cashier says, "Will you be paying cash or credit?" and the duck says, "No thanks, just put it on my bill"

      Sorry about the lag, had the kids all weekend and I kind of shut down when I'm with them. How did you get a gmail account? I tried and they said, "We're sorry. Gmail is in beta test mode and is only being given out to select individuals." Boy I guess I suck. First OU rejects me then Gmail rejects me. I'm starting to feel worthless. At least a raven haired beauty didn't reject me. At least not today...so far...although the day is still young!! Rev G, out.

      Find your pace and be the show. You own the show. YOU OWN THE SHOW! From sneaking in and watching bits and pieces of the play, when you and Doug are on - nothing seems funnier. On a different note, i have been asked to officiate at a wedding this summer. RevG sporting a hawiian choir robe and marrying two people by the pool. How fun can that be? Referring to the title of this post....They also make a good picante sauce. RevG out

      Hey RevG...I have an audition on Thursday for a speaking part in a modified sag feature.  I am not sure what that means but I like the pay scale.  The part is a cheeseball southern lawyer.  Cheeseball?  Hmmm.  You think I can pull off cheeseball.  I set up the video cam in the living room and have been rehearsing the sides.  A video camera setup in a single white middle age mans apartment living room seems so "One Hour Photo"

      I think I told you already but just in case, I have my first official rev duty this coming Tuesday. I will be marrying tom and melody harrington again. They get married every two years on their anniversary and this year they picked me to officiate!!! I smoke cigars on two occasions: poker nights and anytime I feel like it, :-) as for root beer floats, I don't really like mixing ice cream with fizzy liquids. We need to hang out!!

      Of the three day weekend actually feels like day two to me because I worked some on Saturday  But yesterday was very pleasant.  And today shall be as well.  The show is over.  It went well.  It had its challenges.  Some thought I could not do farce but I think maybe they have changed their minds.  I hope so.  I had fun.  I think I will bike around the lake today and then maybe a little poolside action.  The life of Riley.
