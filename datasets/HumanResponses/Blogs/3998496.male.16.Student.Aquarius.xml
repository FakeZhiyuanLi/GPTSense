      Hey, SorryI didn't post yesterday but i was really busy. Anyway today was probally the hardest day of my life. Everythink I saw reminded me of Renee. For thoes of you who don't know, Renee is my ex-girlfriend. I can't get her out of my head at all. All day was bad. I went to Office Max to get a ethernet card advertized at 4 bucks! i get there to find they dont have it. Plus I turn my head to see a girl who looked like Renee. Thats quincidence number one. So I go to get somthing to eat with Rochelle. The lady in the booth next to me has a lip ring that looked exactly like Renee's. Thats number 2 for thoes of you keeping score. But wait Bob there more. I come home and my friend calls me asking if I'm still with that chick (Renee). Got the entire day was like Renee fest. Plus to top it of, Me,Cherynn, Dave, Chris, and Rochelle&nbsp;are sitting in my car when Rochelle breaks one of my green neon lights. Now I owe dave 24 big ones. So I come home at like 10:30 and get online. Elaine is chewing my ass out cuz of a shity day she had. So then I tell her how today was like a Renee fest. And the boom! Renee is online. So we are talking and she claims to be thinking of me but not in a romantic way. Already seeing this not go my way. So she leaves and like I tell her&nbsp;like I think of her everyday. I wonder what shes thinking right now. So im going to bed ill talk to you all later.

So anyway, after that I got a message from chris. We are going to Elaine's casa today. So we leave around 2:15 to be there by three cuz we though we were gonna have to walk. Yet my father comes to the resque and drives us there. So anyway we get there to prepare to walk to albertsons. The only thing we are missing is Shiela. Well she takes ferever to get ready. Damn anyway she shows up with a brother that has a car so we got a ride.  So we get to albertsons when me and Elaine go off to find some stuff while Chris and Shiela go off to get Strawberrys.  So we meet up with all the stuff and go to the self check out. We check out and as we are walking out Elaine goes " My Yohoo!". Turns out we had left it behind but it was to hot to walk back all that way so now I owe Elaine a thing of Yohoo. So we get back to Elaine's house and kick back a few when I yell out "Body Shots" Me and chris get no actions but the girls fucken go at it. DAMN, to hella hot girls giving each other bodyshots. (Even a lil more) So me and chirs left now im here talking to you im done BYE.

      Ok sit down and shut it for a sec, So yesterday i was going to my final day of contract summer school. I get off the freeway onto stevensen. Im going down the street when my breaks fail and I colide into a poor lady infront of me. So I pull over to Omar street. I get out to find that my hood and side pannel are buckled and my front headlight is gone. The first thing I do is apologize to the lady. She was so nice about the whole thing. If i were in her shoes I would have lost my cool. (Thank you for being so nice if your reading this) So I see that her car has minimal damage done to it. So we ask for each others insurance information and all that jazz. So I call my mom who i thought was gonna kill me. turns out she was understanding. No police report was filed, no one was hurt. So it turns out the car will take about a week later and $1500 to fix. And by the way this is all because Dave like to pull my parking break when while im driving. So no car for me i am going to bed now bye

      Wow 3 days. Ok im going to tell you about the past weekend. So thursday was Ozzfest 2004 at the Shoreline Ampatheater. IT FUCKEN ROCKED. Throwdown, God Forbid, Otep, Unearth, Lamb of God, Lacuna Coil, Atreyu, HATEBREED, and last but cerntinly not least SLIPKNOT! I got there about 8:45 and waited in line. So i get in when Mike Chueffo called me. he was with Robert Rios and Harris. So we hung out when we met of with Casey and Aaron Johnson and Keven. My dad finally left and thats when mayham broke loose. I let out so much anger in the pit. All the stress of presenting an image was gone. After that Roachelle called me so we met up. I met her friend Merced. She was pretty cool. Merced wanted to see Atreyu so we made our way to the front of the crowd. They fucken rocked so hard. i didnt think they were gonna be so good. By the way jake got to crowd surf during Atreyu. So after them we waited fer fucken Lamb of God. That pit was crazy. So me and Casey whent to get fucken something to drink cuz we had seen Hatebreede before. (They sound just like there CD). Then the 9 gods were on. It took the stage crew like an hour just to set there tottally awsome equipment up.  Then we had to wait another hour fer them to come out. I swear between the pot being offered to me and being squished I could not breath. Then we see Joey come to the stage. he start up Liberate. then the rest of them hit the stage. It was the best experience of my life. I am not detirmend to see them in concert just them. It was funny Chiffuo wanted me to go in the pit. I said no but i was pushed in 5 sec. after he went in. So after me a Chiffo meet up and I find out he looses his wallet. He lost it in his back pocket. (Dumbass) So me and chiffuo get food. We miss black lable socity and suberjoint ritual. We make it back in time fer Dimmu Bijoru. They were ok, I didnt really like them. Me and Casey were just chillin when we relize that Kevin is fucken high off his as. This dude fucken had one of thoes tall ass fish bone coctail glasses. He thought it was a sword. So this chick comes up to him to ask for the "sword" so she can make a bong. Well to make a long story short. We lost a good sword. So neway me and Casey were making fun of Judist Prist cuz rob Halford is gay. He takes it in the but and like it. So I see my friend Chris Ayadia. He was with his gay friend that was trying to pick up on Roachelle. So kevin starts thowing grass on the dude to piss him off. Dude get up and fucken gets the shit kicked out of him and his best friend. (WORSHIP THE DEVIL) by the way thats an inside joke.  I DONT REMEMBER ANYTHING THAT HAPPEND FRIDAY  SaturdayMe and Michael kicked it. justin came over and so did tony. We hung out fer a while. Then tony went to elanes house. So me mike and justin go to justins house. he got the shit chewed out of him from his mom (not telling y). So we went inside justin like got ready fer the day cuz he claimed that he was not going home. So yea we picked up tony and elane and Elane goes "Jason take me to my friend chicken". She didnt ask she just told me. So yea start to piss me off plus Mike kept makeing fun of my driving. So when they got out of the car tony juped in and i took off. Yes I LEFT THEM THERE. No i dont regret it. It shows i cant be pushed around. So yea thats the end of that day.  Let see sunday, I studyed fer my Geometry final fer tommorw wish me luck guys.
