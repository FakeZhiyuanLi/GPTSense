      i jumped the bandwagon of carrie wannabes everywhere.  here's to a successful display of whatever it is i used to scribble on cinema tickets, old school books, tissues, dinner receipts, envelopes, binded B5's etc.  welcome to the tour.

      i know, usually in every writing there should be a proloque. i know, in my head i've been playing various ways to start the opening for this blog. some maybe notions of what i hold as the basis of future discussions in this blog. but at the moment i lack time. but i still want progress. this blog is preciouss.....  i start with a poem, then.  this poem is the opening to a book i used to scribble in.   how my pen ejaculates   my pen, the substitute for a quill, vomits enormous nuances in a universe of lexicons, a lie is divine.  It has come to me that the size of the handwriting imitates the girth of the pen or is it not the will of the author?  quivers to the heart are not shot by the pompousness of appearance it is by the delicacy of manner child-like idiosyncracies that thaws prejudice                 Who should resist?  Nibs that go through throats    are just as fatal as scythes that severe heads.

      i have given some thought of introducing, and describing myself.   but how do we view ourselves? can we be honest in describing ourselves? there are a lot of things that we hate about ourselves that some times we choose to see only what we want to see. and in every flaw, we'll try to paint a silver lining to it. well, at least i did.  sometimes i am confused of what i am with what i want to be. which is more important?  people say love yourself, never change. but what if the things you call your attributes are on the negative side? and, if attributes are subjective, for example, your looks, your social behaviour, your idiosyncracies, your pet peeves, do we really have to bother to change at all?  what if what is negative and what is positive is also subjective? they say that some man's food is another man's poison.  how do we differentiate with what people expect of you with what you want? if your desire is to be respected and loved by the society, do you not have to conform to what is acceptable in society?   i would say that the way the society (or 'those people around you') views an individual is also a basis in which one views himself. besides, we need reassurances.  that is why we need mirrors.  have you tried combing your hair without a mirror?  it is not the mirror, however, that combs your hair. it is you. the mirror only serves to reflect you.  so i brushed aside the idea of introducing myself. let my mirrors do it.

      Dear Pam(ela),  (poster girl for the anti-development coalition)  I have just returned from a very relaxing holiday in Pulau Perhentian. The place was nice, with crystal clear waters and white sands, something of a rarity when the case is water in its natural context.  	Our accommodation was a low key, laid-back affair, hut style structures with thatched roofs or ‘touch-the-earth-lightly’ cabin-like structures. In this pristine environment and maybe one of the few surviving earthly paradise such attitudes of not replacing anything, of leaving things as they were, are the most desirable. Such high value is this masterpiece of God, as if a single stroke of men’s brush, no matter how tiny a speck it is, would disrupt the beauty of it.  	A different scenario greeted us when we ventured to the other side of the beach. A permanent, heavy, concrete structure stands in all the shallow grandeur of a so-called ‘upper-class’ establishment. This bit of paradise raped by a bulky foreign body. All in the name of ‘development’, or ‘proper design’, or even - ‘design’.  	In Petaling Street, Kuala Lumpur the ad-hoc nature of the stalls (though it is dictated by the needs of the hawkers), the myriads of sights and sounds, sometimes pleasant, sometimes repulsive, nevertheless rich, all contributing to the spontaneity and immediacy of the place, which makes it attractive in the first place, is ‘improvised’ by means of a paved walkway and a tensile roof that incidentally veiled a part of the façade, and sometimes can prove to be dauntingly hot.  	Another street that has gone through a similar situation is Campbell Street, where the paved street reduces the once bustling thoroughfare (and foreseen by the authorities-that-be to have commercial potential) to a dry environment, where the pedestrian actually seldom walks by anymore, because the seemingly neat paving deters hawkers from doing business there. Thus the street is deprived of pasembor stalls, cendol stalls, cobblers, ottu kedais – street activities that liven up the local streets of Penang. Such delight it is to stumble upon these little treasures when walking in the streets. Besides, they make the streets occupied, a commendable anti-mug device. When they are gone, the streets are a horror to walk.  	To top it off, this process of beautification pushed rents up, and many existing tenants are perturbed, as business are also dwindling, for customers that used to park next to the shops for a quick purchase can no longer do so as car access to the paved street is limited. A banner that says ‘No More Campbell Street in Little India’ is a testament of the local’s sentiments of non-approval of what has been done, or, despite what the negative outcome of what has been done, what repetitively would be done elsewhere.  	Does ‘improvement’ means beautification? Would an ornate door handle work better than a plain one? Does development means quantity? Would many cars show development instead of a carefully crafted, efficient one? Is ‘development’ equal to grandeur? Is a thatched, indigenous, humble, traditional structure less ‘developed’ than a heavy, off-scaled, bulky, structure? 	 It has come to me that a ‘proper’ design, or even ‘design’, nowadays means exaggerated forms, flashy materials and quantity. To design is to make something ‘prim and proper’. By ‘prim and proper’ I mean, to have something put up standing. ‘Improvement’ is always gauged by materialistic means.  	Let me demonstrate a point. In a brief calling for a ‘pasar malam’ venue, a designer would set up concrete, permanent structures as stalls, where the hawkers would do their business. An absence of anything structurally tangible would mean that the designer hasn’t ‘designed’ anything, thus the allocated commission is not well earned, not worth commissioning a professional architect in the first place.   Responding to a similar brief another designer would just indirectly set up the space as to conjure ‘place’, maybe through mounds suggest territoriality of each stalls (which are to be provided by hawkers themselves, as to promote ‘spontaneity’) and lots of elements that makes up a conducive tropical open-air environment like water features, mists and lush greenery.  But the latter designer, due to the absence of a certain physicality of ‘structure’, is to be deemed ‘not designing’. To find ways of cleaning the Segget, to devise ways that would ensure its perpetual cleanliness, or revamp the city so that it would not pollute the river is seen as ‘not designing’. Designing, it seems to me now, is to build a physical, concrete, mega structure that covers the whole of the unsightly Segget.   It is not to say though, that the architect should not build, for it is what is expected of the architect, it is the job of the architect. Just that, we should build accordingly. Where a ‘no-touch’ approach is desirable, or ‘don’t touch anymore’ approach is desirable, we should oblige accordingly.  If the making of the space has to be realized through concrete mega structures, so be it. If the making of the space requires an evocation of ‘place’, and not necessarily through structures, then likewise, so be it. The problem now is that for every problem the solution that we always took was to build big and bombastically. For instance, to solve traffic jams we build bypasses. To secure an area we build perimeter walls. To clean a dirty market we demolish it and build a new sparkling one.  Development should not be necessarily through state of the art, bulky, grand buildings, but the achievement of certain sophistication as to decide on ‘appropriate building’. On the improvement of quality, rather than an improvement in quantity, in size and shallow grandeur. The quaint, rather than the bombastic.  With warmest regards, Khairil.

      I wrote this after i read Twelfth Night. Such an influence! This is my take on Shakespeare (i am not even close to being close!), depicting a snippet of an ancient but fond memory imbedded at the back of my head. This piece shall be revised for the better.   Scene 4  (part of): At the junction near the State Mosque, night time. The junction is illuminated by a lampost, with the mosque barely visible amidst trees.   Cast :(Sebastian, Viola, Sir Andrew)   Sebastian  (to Voila):  That bag thou bear might usher thee the night’s spirit away.   Sir Andrew  (chiding in, valiantly): If I could help it not. Come, let me bear thy burden, lest thy spirit it take not.   Viola  (carrying an apparently heavy bag): Nay! This burden is naught for thee to bear, for this bag I give, I  give also my heart. Thus let the bearer of my love bear also the burden of this bag.           Sebastian  (taking the bag from Voila): Then let this bearer of thy love bear also thy burden.      Hand me thy heart.

      i used to ponder why is it that i choose (is it really choice or is this just a consolation to myself, still remains a mystery till this day)to remain single for so long. maybe because i'm surrounded with so many groups of friends. i call them 'crowds'. what i lack from one 'crowd' i harvest from another. in time i will be completed myself.    i gather from all around me, things that nourish and make me grow. Things that support me. I turn to them  for emotional support for intellectual stimulation for spiritual guidance for familiarity of environment for a confidante for encouragement for loyalty for competition for a secured relationship for insults for physical affections for sexual intercourse for meaningful conversations for quality time for warm embraces for shared interests for opposing opinions for a mentor/patronage for precedence for example for envious remarks for assuring praises for reality counter-checking for financial assistance for a chaperone for marriage counselling for recreational activities for constructive criticisms for transportation for enlightenment for verbal knowledge for visual delight  I think, that it is unfair to expect so much from a single person.               I think, or to be more exact, i re-think, that with  love , you can actually get from a single person,  all of the above.

      nowadays the paradoxical is very cool.   take for example : "i am a liar"  the statement cannot be true. because, if it's true, then he cannot be lying. so he is lying that he is a liar. If it's not true, then he is still lying, because he is saying an untruth.   like the end is the beginning is the end is the beginning is the end (from smashing pumpkins)  like a museum for commemorating death that celebrates life. how ironic.  enjoy  urlLink this.

      i love conversations. my idea of a perfect evening is a group of friends hanging out together, at a cozy eatery having nice, warm food while it's raining outside, and having a nice chit chat, instead of a night out at the club, where you end up all sweaty and tired and your body smells of smoke.  or a moment with a confidante, telling each other secrets or your present state of mind. from these conversations you get a wealth of (useless?) verbal knowledge like say, why is a country so reputedly rich like Brunei maintains a low profile.  i have many memories of such meaningful conversations.  these sessions of 'meaningful conversations' come from:  i)meaningful conversations  talks about family, about how we view ourselves, anecdotes from our past, about our ambitions, about our plans  ii) meaningful person  a person you have a liking to, who wins your favour, or simply your best friend, your confidante  iii) meaningful groups of people  an ensemble of people, that with a certain combination, intentionally or unintentionally strikes up a memorable evening  iv) meaningful places  on the rooftop, the water tank at the academic building, secret loft in a dormitory roof, on your backs, underneath the stars on the cricket turf, railway stations, alfresco dining areas, cozy eateries (like A&W PJ, Hua Mui Cafe at Jalan Dhoby JB, lounge at The Regent BB), your communal living room, your freshly-mowed lawn while having a nice small barbeque.  thus, in the end, i come to realize that what i call 'meaningful conversations', does not mean 'conversations'. sometimes non that was being spoken is remembered. it is the scene. how i walk from that scene feeling content. it is not made up of merely 'conversations', it is the company, as well as the ambience.

      two things why today i am suddenly (?) nostalgic.  today i woke up greeted by the prospects of a yummy day. the rumbling of thunder, overcast skies, smell of impending rain.   rain.   i love rain, or, the aftermath of rain. i think in every idealistic picture of bliss that plays in my head would include rain. If it rains, it means i get to wear my yummy clothes. snug, fuzzy, warm cozy clothes (ie sweaters and long-sleeved t-shirts, the highlands would be perpetual bliss!).  and to complement this state of fuzziness with something hot. like hot chocolate. i remember myself making my sister a cup of hot chocolate while waiting for my turn to hog the phone after midnight. such coziness!  picture these (with background drizzle):   i) sitting in a thatch-roofed wakaf, sipping hot black coffee and having 'ubi rebus'.  ii) strolling down a street off Orchard Road with a friend and admiring rows of conserved old shophouses in Singapore, at night time.  iii) sneaking out to have a walk with a friend while everybody else is cramped indoors with books to prepare for next day's exam. (heck, ANY midnight strolls with a friend, then)  iv) reading a book on the most comfortable sofa next to a fireplace (people, i am allowed to imagine) reading English Patient while on the radio, sings Norah Jones.  v) be animated by the falling of raindrops through your bedroom window with Anda Bunga's 'Tentang Seseorang' as the soundtrack.  vi) be drenched from head to foot, sitting in a restaurant and a caring friend insists that you eat something hot because he/she is concerned you might get hyperthermia.  and it is saturday.  when i was younger i used to get up very early on Saturdays to watch Saturday morning cartoons (the reason this is such a big deal is that i'm  not supposed  to wake up early, it's a no-school day!). My siblings would frolick a little bit around the house, eat cereal breakfast and frolick some more while waiting for the programme to start. the finale of the event would be eating  dadih  from the pasar tani.  those are the good ol' days. *sigh*

      Dear Chris Martin, (wounded Trojan who will make a comeback)  My Birthday was a blast!! They got me a cake, and played 'Allah Selamatkan Kamu!' on mp3. afterwards they played 'YMCA', in which the lyrics at the opening of the song says "young man!" - they were playing sarcastic songs for me!  I really thought there would be no 'rumbling*' involved, for the cake was set in the studio, where a no-mess clause reigns (and a seminar was on the next day). i actually danced to the tune of YMCA in spite of this.  But suddenly i was dragged out of the studio, brought to the toilet (cleaning was easier) and *clobbered with eggs,  serbuk kunyit  and-  -and oh! even pee! before the plastic that held the pee was smashed on me I vommited my birthday cake out unto the protagonist's quiksilver t-shirt and he threw up back on me, and vice versa, and it continues until we are both covered with vomit, spit and pee. we actually had this taped, thanks to the technology of digicams.  at the end of it all, the mess was cleaned, the seminar went well, i got heaps of sms and calls from well wishers (including Celcom) and another fond memory is added to my bank. this i shall look back with a smirk on my face.  too bad you're not here.   With warmest regards,  Khairil

      yesterday was my 25th Birthday. on special occasions i like to do special things. like patriotic things(?)   I am particularly interested in the way it is depicted how Indonesians treasure their language. My only exposure to the culture of the Indonesians is through their music and movies, a current rave in Malaysia. I have never been to Indonesia, though i have the privilege of conversation with some, courtesy of my parents entertaining guests from there at the house, and an exchange student at my University. What I will always remember from one conversation is how he describes the journey to Bandung - "seperti sebuah kisah cinta, (love story) gitu". This bit of poetry in a normal conversation.   In countries like Indonesia and Thailand their identity shows through and through. Here I feel we are stripped bare layer by layer. Our love for the future should not erase the past.  Pokok yang menjulang tinggi masih berakar di bumi .  Ilham aku bertitik tolak dari drama Lantai T. Pinkie karya A. Samad Said, menggambarkan satu memori ketika harijadi aku beberapa tahun dulu.   drama: Bastille    Babak 4:  Di hadapan Rumah Tumpangan Ah Kow, salah sebuah unit di deretan rumah kedai Cina Peranakan lama. Terdapat sebuah beca tempat Nyai duduk menunggu penarik beca. Semua kedai lain sudah tutup, dan cahaya hanya dari ruang laluan di depan rumah tumpangan.   Watak:  Nyai Sunarti, Puteh Su.   Puteh Su:  (Baru turun dari rumah tumpangan, membetul-betulkan rambut) Wah Nyai! Semalaman tak nampak kelibat kau. Ke mana kau?   Nyai Sunarti:  Aku pergi menonton wayang gambar.   Puteh Su:  (Berminat) Dengan siapa ya?   Nyai Sunarti:  Teman-temanku, lelaki.   Puteh Su:  Wah! Apa kau tak takut Tuan Delarossa?   Nyai Sunarti:  Ah! Kedua-duanya pun berjawatan besar, berpangkat. Aku fikir hari jadiku ini, biarlah aku bebas sebentar dari Tuan Delarossa.   Puteh Su:  (Dengan nada perli) Wah! Kau bermain politik ya Nyai?   Nyai Sunarti:  (Ketawa) Ya! Politik! Cerita politik boleh bikin wayang! Tapi cerita semalam pun bagus juga, Su. Baru saja mula, aku sudah mahu kencing.   Puteh Su:  Kau mahu kencing?   Nyai Sunarti:  Ya. Terpaksalah aku tahan.   Puteh Su:  Tapi kau kata kau bebas?   Nyai Sunarti:  (Tersentak dan berfikir sejenak) Aku...aku menahan kencing.

       which part of all this is crazy logic, you ask?  bear with me.  Death. sometimes taken as the ultimate solution to problems we have in life. recently a dear friend wrote of bouts with the angel of death. i wish him well. is it greener on the other side? what other side?   The President’s Commision, 1981, stated that   An individual who has sustained either i)                    irreversible cessation of circulatory & respiratory functions ii)                   irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain including the brain stem, is considered DEAD. ( Charles A.Corr et al, 2000)  this is the secularist/scientific definition of death. These definitions, however, are based on purely functional aspects of the body’s mechanism. In these secularist Western scientific definitions the existence of a ‘soul’ is somewhat ‘overlooked’.  what do poets and philosophers think of death?  Death is man’s encounter with the reality of his mortality. A question of one’s control of his own life.  It is considered by some to be a change or migration, rather than an extinction. It is a natural law, death is a corollary of birth. Death is simply an absence of life, a state of non-being, a converse of birth. It is a return to a state of unconsciousness. These are but a few ponderings on death. It is strengthened by accounts from the deemed wise and enlightened few.  Aristotle called death a kind of destruction or perishing that involves a change from being to non-being. Death is seen to involve a change in the very substance of the being. When a human dies, two important consequences follow: i)                    there is no longer human present - instead, there is only a body or corpse ii)                   there is no longer a person present – there is only the person’s remains  Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, gives this account of death when he was sentenced to death:   This thing that has come upon me must be good; and those of us who think that death is an evil must needs be mistaken. For the state of death is one of two things : either the dead man wholly ceases to be and loses all consciousness or…it is a change and a migration of the soul to another place. And if death is the absence of all consciousness, and like the sleep of one whose slumbers are unbroken by any dreams, it will be a wonderful gain…For it appears that all time is nothing more than a single night. But if death is a journey to another place, and what we are told is true – that all who have died are there – what good could be greater than this? What would you not give to converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer? It would be an inexpressible happiness to converse with (heroes such as these) and to live with them and to examine them.   In this instance we can observe that Socrates posed the concept of death open to be contemplated. One could see death as the end, or the continuation of a journey.  Consider these ruba’iyat of Omar Khayyam :   Although I have a handsome face and colour, Cheek like the tulips, form like the cypress, It is not clear why the eternal Painter Thus tricked me out for the dusty show-booth of earth.    When the cloud washes the tulip’s cheek at New Year, Get up and make firmly for the wine-cup, Because this green spot that today is your pleasure-ground Tomorrow will all be growing out of your dust  Oh wise elder, get up earlier in the morning, Look closely at that boy sifting dust; Advise him, ‘Gently, gently sift The brains of Kaikobad and eyes of Parviz.'                                                                                                  (Peter Avery et al, 1979)             From these stanzas we could see that Khayyam metaphorically envisioned that when a person dies, the substance of the person dissolved to become one with nature, or a ‘return’ to its original state (in this case with earth, for Muslims believed man was created from this element) and continues in some form or another.            One underlying structure that we could sense in all of these philosophical descriptions of death is that there is a ‘soul’, and that the physical body is just a vehicle in its journey, from the realm of the non-being to being and back.              What part of all this is crazy logic, u still ask?   to be continued.

      an interval on the discussion of death. this one is a favourite in my 'pillow sessions'. a conversation i had a few years back, when i was young(er) and naive. and i think it's a staple with  jiwang  couples everywhere. which answer means that Person 2 loves Person 1 more?   Person 1:   kalau aku mati kau nangis tak ? (if i die, would you cry for me?)   (Version A)   Person 2:   Nangis.  (I would)   (Version B)   Person 2:   Jangan cakap pasal mati.  (do not speak of death)  cast in your votes.
