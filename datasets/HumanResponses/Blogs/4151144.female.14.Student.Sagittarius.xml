      What is a love letter? Is it a good idea to write one or just keep your feelings to yourself? What do you write on the paper? You have more than enough to say to fill the paper with lines and lines of thoughtful words. But what exactly are those thoughtful words? Are they  " I love you." ?  Or maybe  " You are my everything. "  Who knows? But I think it's beautiful. I live for ink and mushy feelings.

       Kayla called me. I just got off the phone with her. The conversation drifted slowly through the subjects of her boyfriend Dustin and how much she misses him. Whice all in all lead me to think of Trent. She refers to him as  "my man ". I must say I do like the sound of that. But in all reality he's not  "my man".. well not yet atleast. Let's not forget that he's 17 and lives on the other side of the state. But as lame as this sounds I'd be willing to make it work. It would be my first ever relationship, if that's what you want to call it. I don't know, it's not like me to be like this. It's just..when we danced. Oh lord, when we  touched .   I wrote him two letters and sent him a picture of him and I together. I told him to call me sometime. I hope he does. I hope he writes back also. I miss him so much. He if calls I think I just might ask him out. But don't quote me on that. I'm not going to say that he's  "the one".   I hate how everyone feeds me this crap about there being someone for me. Screw that. There is not someone for everyone. Atleast not for me. The only one that I could ever want to marry is Lucas. But he's out falling in love with someone else right now. Wait, I take that back. He's always out falling in love with someone else other than me.  But still he says he  "cares about me".  Then why did you say no? Oh yeah, you have a girlfriend.

      They can tell me what to do. But they can't tell me how I should feel. Pain, happiness, anger, hopeful, scared, nervous, dare I even say love? It's all mine. I can do what I want with it. If I want to scream with fright I can, can't I? Can I miss someone? Could I actually go that far? Do I really feel attached to that person that I wish to be with them forever more? But feelings change. Maybe for the worse. There is always the chance that you'll be pushed away. Slammed against the walls of rejection. With no mercy for your heart. The person you feel so dear about doesn't even know what type of pain they have put upon you. But you can't tell how they feel. You can't even begin to guess. The only way you know is if they say so. But are you even ready to take that chance? Are you ready to fail?

      How can you really tell someone is a fake? Who has the right to say their fake? Why would they care if someone is fake? Who's the smarter one, the one who makes the comment or receives it? Why would someone waste their time labeling someone else when they know they are just going to get slammed by the person they made the comment to? Does it really make the other person feel joy? If it does, do you think they have a sick handle on happiness?
