      Well, the cat and the dog have now met, and it wasn't pretty. The dog went wild and so did the cat. Neither have a scratch on them, but you would think they should both be very injured. Unfortuneatly, Mom tried to save the cat during the fight, and the cat bit her finger. So then it was off to the hospital of her shot and some antibiotics. So everyone is OK, but something has to be done about the two animals living together.

      Well, we just got back from Brin's first trip to the the vet, and she's happy and healthy. Brin did very well, she doesn't mind having people touch her so the vet was no problem. We are taking her back to get fixed on the 26.  Well, poor Brin's crate is too small for her, so we are going today to get her a bigger one. I will post some pictures of her in it when it's all set.

       urlLink    Well, we brought her home yesterday. It was late when we got back with her, about 10:30. She was very good in the car, we used a harness that buckles her into the seat, and she didn't seem to mind it. She LOVES cats. Poor Hoshi. The cat is now in the porch, and the dog in the rest of her house. The dog just wants to play with her, or eat her we're not sure which. Oh well, eventually they will have to get used to each other. The crate we got her is too small, so we have to get her a different size. She whined and whimpered last night, but eventually she fell asleep. She already knows to 'sit', 'speak', 'kisses', and sort of knows to come. She is very cute. We think there is some great dane in her, as well as some chow chow. The people at the shelter also said she may have had puppies recently.&nbsp; urlLink
