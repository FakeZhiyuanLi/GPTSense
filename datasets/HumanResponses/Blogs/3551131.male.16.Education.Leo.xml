      Hi!! Two days since i have last posted. Quite a long time. Feelin much better today, although a little sleepy. In fact, very sleepy. Didnt have much sleep. Worked on my projects till quite late. Then i had to wake up early this morning. Earlier than usual because i had to follow other people's car to school. Mum's not around. She's at Penang attending cousin's wedding. Kinda missed her. She's not really like this often. Aih..  I went to Cheer 2004 yesterday. Fantastic! Once again, Shirtliff won. Two years consecutively. Not bad huh? 2nd place was Dynamitez and 3rd was Adele. Shirtliff, i tell you. Superb, flawless, synchronized, consistent and energetic. Good choreography and beautiful stunts. I loVe em'! Dynamitez was not bad as well... IN fact even more energetic than the Shirtliffs, but they screwed up their last stunt if im not mistaken. Or they will probably win. Adele, another team same from Xavier was good for a newcomer. I tell you if there is a best supporters award, it definitely goes to Xaviers definitely. The crowd from them, piercing i tell you. Screaming all the way. But it cooled down when Xavier had performed and came back crying because they screwed up some stuff. Atmosphere there was energetic. Met up with some old school friends there as well. Lotsa people.  Ahh...Head perfect was announced today. No gona post much comments as i can see the situation at the chatbox has kinda...flared up. LOL... Chill everyone. Nevertheless, im sure lots of you guys who arent prefects will not understand and jus say it stupid to be dramatic over such small stuff. Well fair enuff.As i will think the same if i werent a prefect also. hehhe... BUt not a very good thing to point out at this moment though as everyone is still not chilled over the stupidity of our form 5 prefects. Not to mention the ego. There definitely an ego about the size of a watermelon in them, no doubts about that. Back to Head prefect, Adi's the head. Made his debut today. Not a bad speech. Havent seen any responsibilities or head prefect jobs doing from him yet. Definitely can see some humility or some say.. 'Cowardness'.. But i don really call it cowardy. Truly understands why he does certain stuff. Anyways, praises for him for putting the form 5 on duty and off week for form 4. LOve it. hahahha.   Well.. a friend had an some 'pms' prob today. Got to be the bad mood mocked victim. As usual, im always being insulted as if i don exist anymore in this world. Nobody notices much as they hear me get it all the time. Well im kinda irritated by that behavior. If bad mood, jus lemme know..'hey.not in a good mood now'.. will be perfectly fine. But no...JUst had to scold someone. And here he comes! Kelvin..Nows my chance to let everything out on him cos i dowan anybody else to hate me as only Kelvin knows the real me inside. Then late in the evening, sees him again. Asks for help.. tried to help.. got another mock instead. This is what i think. Some ppl jus really got egos much bigger than their oversized head and thinks that theyre perfect and everyone else in the world are cheap dirt. Selfish thoughts and unappreciated help replies jus pisses me off. As of my opinion, these are all spoil brats who are darn stubborn who ask for help. And when they get stuff that doesnt go their way, then they dislike it and jus insult you for it. They assume you think you are perfect. Well, hear me out...I DIDNT FORCE YOU TO TAKE IT!!! IF YOU THINK YOU ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO PERFECT, THEN FIND YOUR OWN WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Fook out...

      Well..elections are over. Pretty stupid if u ask me.. To ask students to vote for the head prefect. As if its the president of a student's body which is gona give a shit about the students affair. Stupid Aiza. Thinks that the students are gona really be serious in this la. Kiss my ass! Brainless git. And i actually looked up to him. And the students. Keep on chanting for Adi non-stop. Macam la they think he is the right man for the job. some only support him because he is their friend while some are just protetsing against Form 4 as THEY are the responsible ones. No idea how im gona work if his name is announced.   All this fuss about the elections, the worries, the strategies... All comes from three stupid gits who think that it would be 'challenging' and rather funny for the other candidates. Just three. Isnt it ironic? How three mindless screwed up assholes can mess up an entire school discipline board? And all they have to say is ' whats done is done..sorry' Sorry my ass! _l_ . Unless there is another way of changing things around, the rest is nothing but utter nonsense if u ask me. Don really see any future for the board.. It really bothers me. I want to do some homework also cannot. Kept on thinkin bout all these and when these things comes to my mind, i get pissed. Then no mood to study as exams are a week away. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sprained my back today during volleyball. Probably because i have only gone to one training in 3 weeks! CRap! summore im in first team. stupid. Just when im given the oppurtunity to gain some shine in my life, some stupid crap comes in. Everybody is after me because im so called the lousiest in the team which i willingly admit. But still..First team.. Damn cool for me. Argh!   Physics project was quite a success for my group. Actually its not even a group work. its a pair. Once again the great hero is sick. So sick that he had to go home early and still can go ice hockey at 9.30pm. So much for getting sick. Like how the Malay saying goes 'Hendak seribu daya, Tak hendak seribu dalih'. I can come up with lots of excuses im reluctant to do something. Anyways, i gtg now. wana watchin Malaysian Idol..hehe.. Fook out...

      Ahh..Feelin much better already. Still gotta blow my nose every now and then, but im ok.. Anyways..today is another project day. Go to shyan place again.. sit around.. and as always..another group member din come. Says that he's got things to do. very bz. got sej proj to pass up. lotsa hw. Talkin as if we aint got the same amount. In fact more.. Sigh..Excuses... Supposed to make a car this time. A car that is able to propel the furthest among all the groups. Problem now is... WE STILL HAVENT COME UP WITH A CAR!!! Shit.   Anyways.. Elections tomorrow. Four candidates. Adi, Teck Eng, Teck Kuan and Praveen. Well, im Teck Kuan's campaign manager and i really think he can do stuff. Well this is the time when im gona be really down to earth because im gona make some comments on every one of them. Adi.. Well, He's a friendly guy, humble, someone who really has got his supporters and was nominated cos  some jokers from the prefect board think it would be challenging and fun. Means that he is not nominated for his capability to be head, leadership skills or anybody thinkin he is the right man for the job. He's still Form 3. He's got lots more time to gain his experience. So, take it easy.   Teck Eng. He's da big twin. He was a leader for his team at camp, Gangstas! (I was part of the team), has some leadership qualities, quite humble although not all the time and has a look of a leader. However, he can be real cocky at times, playful, very friendly, clicks well with everyone, but sorry to say..i don see him as a head prefect. NO offense..  Praveen.. another elected friend of mine. He's da macho man! Drives girls crazy with his abs, olahragawan btw, has good communication with people and has a stronghold of supporters ranging from form 1 to form 5! Nevertheless, he is another playful one, not really serious at everything he does although he can be, but i do not see any leadership qualities in him. But he definitely has got a huge bunch of supporters.  Teck Kuan. NOw He's the right man for the job. Well known for his sense of responsibility, commonly known as 'Future-Head-Prefect' among his friends, he is the person with the right capabilities and suit the position head prefect best. And also like wat is posted outside his class.. Vote For TK = Vote For Amy . Shows that she's all for him. and not to mention his nice ass which drives girls crazy! Despite of these values, he's got an ego that can swell and he doesnt realize it. Can be too responsible if he gets overexcited and he's a blur guy. BUt he is a guy of a rational mind and therefore.. VOTE FOR TECK KUAN!!!! i gotta say this.. im da campaign manager..but watever i said is true..  Anyways, it was a pretty bz week. sticking up the posters and planning the speeches as well as promoting Tk. think it was kinda fun. especially when we stick the posters in the girls toilet.. in the cubicles as well! LOL!!! we thought it would be kinda funny to jus stick their faces there so that when the girls enter the toilet, they would see their faces. hahaha.  We had our last round of campaigning today. was quite a bz one. missed quite some classes. Teck Eng had announced his full support for Praveen today. This done so that people voting for teck eng would vote for praveen instead as Teck Eng will be voting for him. This is probably because that he thinks Praveen is the better man for the job. Well.. Jus the matter of opinions.. So supporters of TEck Eng, Vote For Praveen!  I am glad that those mindless fools who messed around with the nominations had realized that they made a mistake. Because if they dont, they are either blind or stupid. I guess thats all for now... VOTE FOR TECK KUAN!!! Fook out...

      Hey.. Im back! Im back! Im back! Finally!!! Ahh... Home sweet home.. Aint nothing better than this. Genting was ok. Didnt do much. Just hang around. No theme parks, No rides.. Just me and my couz lepaking around. Brought my Playstation along. LOL! Desperate for something to do. hehe... Played some pool and bowling as well. Lotsa Singaporians and Chinese(as in from China). Saw some chun chicks around.. And watch Harry Potter!!! Woohoo!!! Finally!!! After more than a week... The movie was ok. Storyline changed a lot. As well as the landscape of the school compared to the last two movies. Lousy director. When is Hagrid's hut down the hill? I mean.. It was just next to the school in the second movie. Lame... I expected a younger lookin Lupin though... And Hermione's pretty... hehe...  Sigh... Tomorrow's school... 1st day of the new term. Another chance for a new beginning. The mark of the Mid term exam which is two weeks away. Gotta study hard i guess.. But with the unfinished projects and hw from the hols, im gona have a lil prob. Once again, its all the mad bitch's fault...Hmm...Don't know if ive changed myself much during the hols. Had hoped this 2 week hols would fix me up for the better.. from the sense of attitude..well.. i shall see when i get back to school.. this whole month will be one stressful month for me..and a busy one for me as well...Not writing much for this time...gettin late.. wana sleep.. havent got a good sleep for the past 3 days...and HAPPY BIRTHDAY to da LOW bros!!!!

      Ahh... Friday. The last weekday for the hols. The day that i always look forward to. But not this friday. This friday brings me worries, shortage of time and dreadfulness. Relatives from Penang gona reach KL by 5 in the morning.. OMG!!! Freakin early.. And after that... Off to Genting. My so-called 2nd home. Owned by my so-called Uncle Goh Tong. Freakin boring goin to Genting. My parents wana watch some concert up there. I practically live there. Ask me any shops u wana go, any route you wana know.. Ill take you there. Its like the Marauder's Map of Genting in my head. I know all the shortcuts there as well. All the fun stuff up there also played like a hundred times already. So... BORING!!!  I was talkin bout exams with a friend jus now. Apparently, this friend of mine was kinda frustrated when it screwed up. Im pretty sure you guys know how it feels.. You made an effort to do well. Studied hard. Did your revision. And then suddenly, the paper really cracks your head. Keep on pressing your head to figure out the answers. At the end of the exam, you feel kinda disappointed because all your hard work goes down the drain. Then, this is the time when you get really pissed. Well, of my opinion, it doesn't goes down the drain. In fact, you should feel happy even though you don't get good results because you know very well that you studied. And you feel proud that you actually made an effort. You study for yourself. Not for your parents or teachers. School is to gain knowledge for future use. The stupid Malaysian education system made it look like we study to excel in exams. Makin us like book slaves.  Thats all for now... Just wana update everyday while i can. Don think i will be updating anytime this weekend. If i do, oh wellz.. its good then. Enjoy yer hols while you still can. Not gona last long... Fook out...

      Arghh... Two tuitions in the same day. Can you believe it? Physics and Add Math. Damn bloody tiring. Summore stayed at friends place for awhile after my afternoon physics class to do project. And nothing came out. Chatted most of the time. Didn't exactly do a lot of work. Had a nice time chatting though. Damn troublesome this physics project. En.Ariff thinks that we're rocket scientists or something. Do three experiments for your project. Ask him how to do it this is how he will reply with his accent, 'I already gave you the instructions and the formulas. It is up to you to work it out.' No fireworks, no chemical reactions, no ready made stuff.. All construct on your own. Nice and friendly teacher but NASTY... If experiment failed, straight away 15 marks deducted. No comments. SSC...  Anyways, changed my layout again. The last one was rather shitty. At least this looks better. Got SOME people trying to get me to join xanga. More skins, can add media player and more codes. No way man! Im sticking to blogspot. If not, Ill build my own site than joining xanga. hahaha... Im still working on my pictures section. Cant seem to get the perfect size to fit into my sidebar. Photobucket sux in resizing pics. Unfortunately, i don have adobe or any other photo editing programs. So, having some probs now.   Haven't completed any of my projects yet. Gona have a rough week when school reopens. Spent all my time on workin on this blog. Terrible... Tryin to buck up. Summore got my debate. Not yet prepare anything yet. Oh wellz.. Im not speaking. Just sitting at the corner figuring rebuttals for my team. Ahh.. Should be ok i guess.. Time net sux btw. Stupid internet service. Gives you problems all the time. And its freakin expensive! Only uses it when my Jaring has got some prob. 56k sux. Area no steamyx. Using Maxis line for my house phone. I like Maxis though. Service quite good. As in.. If your phone line got some prob, they come right away. Thats why i like 'em... compared to Telekom which takes ages... *yawns* ... Gtg now..kinda sleepy adi. Fook out...

      Ahh Tuesday... 3rd day of the week. Approx 5 more days till school starts. Im not lookin forward to it very much. Kinda dreading it. See Mazura's face, the homework and the exams. Sigh...Life... Why does it have to be so cmplicated? Why cant it just be simple? War goin on, men raping women, ppl killing each other, children suffering from various diseases, and issues of racism going around...And Malaysia is supposed to be a multi-racial commmunity.. All these stuff..for what? Aih..humankind.. We are supposed to be brothers and sisters taking care of each other. Not victimizing each other for our own sake. Anyways, im gona add another section called 'picture of the moment'. Everytime i blog, i will change te pic. It can be any pic. Celebs, school, friends, family, Me hehe.., groups, bands...Jus anything. Well gtg now.. Wana go do some channel surfing..hehe.. Fook out

      Sigh...2nd post...not bad eh? Added a chatterbox at the side there...So..Pls do not hesitate to post anythin there..No Restrictions. Also fixed a jokes corner right below the chatterbox so that my blog won't be so dull. Sometimes the jokes are a bit lame. But bear with me alright? Anyways, woke up around 10 this morning. Lazy to get up so decided to start my Julia book. Read half of it adi. Then went to Ampang for some Yong Tau Foo. Yummy...Nice food, but the place is rather unhygienic and rowdy. Oh well.. Cant be too Choosy when it comes to food. After that went for a lil drive around Old Klang Road. No idea why. Then come home and go online till now. Freakin Hot out there!!! Aih..Damn sad at the moment. Still haven't get to watch HP3. Cinemas freakin long queue all over the place. There goes my 1st day record for the HP movies. Heard that it is quite nice this time. Pretty Hermione. All grown up. Hehehe... Got myself a lil running nose this morning. Damn irritating now. Gotta keep on blowing my nose. Nothing much for the rest of the day. Just stay at home, watch TV or go online. Gotta finish my projects. Damn lazy to do though. Argh!!! Stupid Mazura. Go and ask the exam unit to give us projects to do. Like we got nothing better to do only. Well maybe la... But still... Projects?... I rather go to the gym and embarass myself out with the treadmiller. I hope I spelt treadmiller correctly. Anyways, there seem to be a fella tryin to be Mazura on MSN as well as friendster. You guys should go check there profile out. Damn funny. Spoke to the Mazura fella on MSN. Must be a Chinese guy la. Hmm... If any of you guys know where can I find an audio player to add at my blog, lemme know alright? gtg now. Drop a word or two at my chatterbox pls... Fook out...

      Harloe EVERYONE!!!! Im Back! Hehe.. Back to blog that is. Ahh.. Its been two weeks since i last updated. Been quite busy. With exams, projects and stuff. Its beyond imagination. Never really thought i could do all these. Went through an ordeal in this two-week period. Don really remember anything that i did during the week before exam. Bad memory. Hehe... No matter. The thing is... Im back. So you will see some new crap posting up  again.  Exams are excruciating. Never thought Form 4 could be so tough. Its supposed to be my honeymoon year. This should be the time when every person live out their teenage life best. Not sitting down and pouring over books that arent gona make any changes in my life. As if they are to meant to teach us survival skills and to be streetwise. I definitely dont see how memorizing morale values and its specific explanation is goin to help us to cultivate them. Mindless gits. Those people doin these in the education ministry. Anyway, i got 39/40 for my math objective paper. YAY!!! Never really expected that. But its still good. Hmm... I still got four more papers left for the week. Physics, Chem, Add Math and Acc.   Arghh!! This is boring...probably the most boring post of all... sorry..not really in a mood..cant thinkin of anytin to talk about. I do have lotsa stuff...but jus cant think at the moment..Fook out..
