      Can't get moving today. Like a slug. Nice and sunny out tho. Early afternoon. Feel like being in Hawaii, lying in the sun but not getting a horrible sunburn. I've never been to Hawaii, but lately have been attracted to the '50's kitchsh of it all. Well, you know how it is. Or perhaps not. Perhaps you are highly 'motivated'. I find that I am not. My friend Natalie related an image to me, about how her mum would ride (a horse) through pineapple fields when she lived in Hawaii. You know, my body's okay, energy wise, it's just my mind. She had a hard week. She wants a day off, and I try to tell her 'tomorrow, just wait till Saturday', but she just kind of sits down, staring blankly into space, and passively refuses to get up again. Sigh. Just one of those days. Hope you all getting a bit of this sunshine.

      Hello my loyal readers (hgrhm!!)! Today was a much better day, I'm in a good mood, and put down your parkas cuz hell hath not frozen over (hmmm...did I take 1 or two of those pills?...). I managed to have a nice full day of school, and I've still got energy. I have a lot of catching up to do, but I'll be okay. Yesterday I heard Jack Kerouac recite some of his poetry over the net, and the sound was great and it was actually quite moving to hear him ask for a 'ciggy-boo'. Been listening to Ella and Glenn and Andre 3000. I've got to watch it though, I know I'm gettin' a little high over nothing. I should tend to my boys now, though (the chinchillas). They are huddled together, always a heart melting seen. I'm looking forward to their soft little noses pushing at my hand, looking for treats (raisins, their favorite). It's chilly out there tonight, so I hope you all are tucked in tight. All I have to offer you is my constant, jaw-dropped-open-and-drooling confusion. That's all.  you're faithful life servent, Karolina

      I sit here with bleeding thumb, a casulty of my failed attempt at making a 3D model for a class. I'm such a clutz, and I really don't think things through. Had a big cry session in front of Mother last night--about my general lackings, so it lasted for hours as you can imagine. Really I want to pull the covers up over my head and sleep this thing through. Thing is, I'd be in bed for years. Oh Well. I'm not going to have any of my work ready this week. Watched some tv. Ho hum.

      Hmmm...Alright, it's January 2004 and I've already had many an embarassing moment. My latest--a public emotional breakdown at school where I was struck by one of those crippling depressions which land you on the bathroom floor, immobilised. I'm learning about clay and I'm learning that my mind gets tired quick and then I make stupid decisions regarding how long to let my slab of clay dry before I can slap it into a form, and I can't seem to throw or do anything with clay. I'm a loser and socially inept but I've got two great cats who, for some inconceiveable reason, seem to like me. I cannot speak very well, which makes everyone think I'm sort of stupid which pisses me off and then gets me thinking, yea, maybe I am sorta stupid, and then I think how stupid the concept of 'stupid vs. intelligent' is and how I don't seem to be able to articulate my dislike for the vague and destructive concept of 'intelligence' and then I think, am I just really stupid and lazy? And then the voices say 'yes, now shut up because we don't like the sound of your voice.' and then I go to the psychiatrist who tells me I just need some confidence and then he bills me and I can't stop going cause I've got no self confidence and then and then and then.

      Well, I dropped out of school this past week (again!). I think I'm going for the world's record here, since it is the third time I have officially dropped out of an academic institution. I think I'm okay with it though. I've learned that I simply can't endure the institutional setting, no matter how un-institution like. I've decided to do nothing, for the first time in my life, to put as little pressure on myself as possible. I'll go swimming, spend time with my cats, and if I can, maybe try to write, ya know, just live. I haven't really "written" in years. My psycho gave me some antipsychotics this week, and I took one and passed out. Since then, I 've decided to do without for the moment. He also increased the effexor by 75mg, which is too big a jump, and so the nightmares have been pretty nasty. The literature says I'm supposed to 'inform my doctor' if I have nightmares (they're epic dreams...no break and play out like a novel, the same characters and a story line...they're usually dreadful). Well I've informed many doctors of this side effect, and they don't seem too perturbed. Is there anyone out there who also experiences this side effect?

      Notice how when some people are struck by a temporary depression they immediately stop what they're doing, and set about finding someone/something to blame so they can rid themselves of any trace of discontent (WHO'S TO BLAME??!!). Heaven forbid you're the only one around when this happens, because you have a big fat target stampped on your chest. I'm more of the avoidance clan, hiding under the bed at the first sign of life approaching. Not that one's better than the other. I have almost every personality disorder in the book. Now how about that? How can 'special needs' status accomodate me for that? I fear for my life. I fear I will take it, a knife to the heart, because it is a heart that is full of self-loathing, leaving pools of strife in it's thumping wake. I'm someone who's spent a lot of time in the waiting room, waiting for help, waiting for improvement. I had a therapist who was convinced I was causing myself to be depressed for 'artistic reasons'. If the bitch could only see the violent thoughts that triggered through my head during her sessions, I think she would not have been so cherry cheeked and sure of herself. I fear for those whom she's in the powerful position to 'counsel'.

      Wow, blogger has really become much more sophisticated since I last posted (awhile ago, admittedly). Thanks to the encouragement and kind words of a good friend, I've taken to writing again. This has been quite the week. I came out to said good friend (to Paul, the best of friends) but sort of different than you might expect...came out as not gay...it's a long story. It was truly a quantum leap for me, since I have had much difficulty being open, honest and genuine in the past. It felt so good tho, so much better than I ever could have imagined. I have experienced a new level of inner joy, can laugh with abandon, I think even my skin has taken on a healthier glow. I had my first session with a life coach, which I'm sure played an instrumental part in my opening up. If you're stuck in the 'therapy rut' I urge you to seek out information about life coaching (there's lots of it on the net) or to look up any of Rhonda (life coach extraordinaire) Britten's books and check out the Fearless Living Institute web page ( urlLink www.fearlessliving.org ). I had my last kayaking 'lesson' on small, polluted lake Wilcox (I didn't care, it was so much fun, and so nice to be on the water). I have experienced personal transformation since the last time I wrote. I look forward to sharing my life with you. Namaste.

      I would like to share the names of some of my favorite flowers that grew in the garden this year. I am drawn to the topics of bio-diversity and native flora, tho I've learned to appreciate the 'ornamental' garden as well.   Ruby Flax (McKenzie seeds)  I planted the seeds of this perennial wildflower directly into the earth in the spring, so I was quite surprised when I looked one day and saw a flower of the purest, most brilliant red floating above the fine, pretty foliage. That was a few weeks ago, and now there is an average of about 25 blooms per day. The small, ephemeral blooms only last a few hours a day, they don't bother to open at all if there's not enough sun. Sooo beautiful. I've never seen a shade of red like this.   Marigold, 'Canadian Sunset' (McKenzie seeds)  I planted lots of these in my vegetable garden. They are my favorite marigolds ever, such a profusion of the most perfect yellow-orange colour over fine, dark green foliage. They resemble little lights, and they are mesmerizing.   Marigold, 'Bonanza Bolero' (McKenzie seeds)  A French award winner, stunning bicolour. The colour pattern changes as the bloom opens, and looking down on a plant each flower is unique. Really pretty.   Night Scented Stocks (McKenzie seeds)  I, unfortunately, planted these re-seeding annuals in a container that was ultimately too small. I had to cut them back, so there is a small chance that they'll survive, and an even smaller one that they'll flower again. But the scent given off by the tiny white-purple flowers was heady and intoxicating. Very reminiscent of lilac. They only gave off scent when every drop of daylight was gone. There was truly a lack of scented flowers in the garden this year, which is a shame because I love scented flowers. Next year. It seems to me that newer plants/flowers, especially roses, are fairly bland when it comes to scent. I hear these flowers (the stocks) get better with each passing year, so I suggest planting them directly in the garden.   Begonia   I'm not sure what kind of begonias these are, exactly, but they are one of my favorite annuals ever. I spent one season planting these in a cemetery (as a job). There is a certain shade of luminescent pink flower, paired with a dark green leaf edged delicately with pink that is so beautiful my brain practically explodes on viewing it. These plants glow. They're surprisingly versatile as well. I'm going to attempt to pot some of them and move them indoors in a few weeks.   Sunflower, 'Sunspot'  My favorite flower, and I have many favorites. But this is the One. Well, sunflowers in general, not just this miniature one which is quite beautiful, and perfect if you don't have room to grow the 4' and up ones.   Hemerocallis 'Rocket City'  My favorite daylily EVER!! I planted this a couple of years ago in the front. This spring I moved it to a sunnier location in the back. The flowers were huge and profuse, and the colour was a stunning electric orange. Really, you need a pair of sunglasses to view these flowers. I looove them!   Gooseneck Loostrife  Like it's infamous cousin, the purple loostrife, this is quite the seductive plant, tho not nearly as invasive. I never see this plant in garden centres, and I can't figure out why. It's gorgeous! The foliage looks hand painted, and the delicate white 'goosenecks' that emerge in mid-summer aren't too shabby either. This is one plant that thrived this year, loved the wetness.  Hmm...I hear drops on the window panes, it's raining (again!). The weather has been so very strange this summer.

      In writing this message I intend to record my experience of recovering from a bout of intense emotional mayhem. I know that I am still 'reactive' and that I'm still not doing what's in my best interests with any constancy. But I am learning more about myself with each day that passes. I am thankful that I had this opportunity so that I may reflect on why I reacted the way I did, and how I managed to find myself amongst the chaos.  The first step I took towards finding perspective was to take loving actions. Very simply, I consider a loving action to be an action that will benefit one's overall health. I can take loving actions even when I'm lost in emotional chaos, by putting faith in the process, not the outcome. The loving actions I took were: taking a nice long walk by myself in the evening; thouroughly cleaning the kitchen; sitting outside quietly and listening to the noises of the night; spending time playing with and caring for my pets; working in the garden; singing along to a Sarah Harmer cd; tidying and cleaning in general; eating a healthful meal. By taking loving actions I was able to detach myself from my discombobulating emotions.  I then came upon a short teaching by Buddha and it gently reminded me not to fall into the trap of shame thereby perpetuating my self-loathing. It is quite a beautiful little teaching, and I would like to share it:  "Eleven advantages are to be looked for in the freedom of mind through the practice of love, by making love grow, by making much of it, by making love a vehicle and basis, by persisting in it, by becoming familiar with it, and by establishing it well. What eleven? One sleeps happily and wakes happily, one has no bad dreams, one is dear to both human and non-human beings, one is guarded by the gods; fire, poison and swords do not affect one, the mind concentrates quickly, the complexion is clean, one dies without bewilderment, and if one develops no further, one will reach at least to the Brahma world."

      About ten unripe tomatoes fell off the vine today. I've got them in the kitchen. They're pretty small, but I hope they ripen. One of my cucumber plants has almost completely succumbed to bacterial wilt disease (I thought those cucumber bugs were so pretty! I didn't realise they were killing the plant they are named after). My bean plants aren't happy--they're dying off now, and pretend they don't know me whenever I approach. Strange how I get so wrapped up and obsessesed by something, and then I drop it.   I've made yet another self-discovery--I'm absolutely-one-hundred-and-twenty-percent-full-on-no-doubt-about-it-out-of-my-MIND!! But in my heart, I always knew that.  Ethan I am writing to you now, practically as I type this.  toodles, C

      This post is in direct response to the comments left by Ethan and Paul. I apologize for leaving this general message, I will e-mail you both as soon as I am able. About 12 hrs ago I popped the last tablet of Seroquel that I had, which is an anti-psychotic but for me takes the edge off of my agitation, the most destructive of states. The result is a depressed and sleepy me.  Ethan: Thank you for your kind, encouraging words. I never, ever want to cause people to think that they must e-mail me every day. I didn't e-mail you either. It's okay, I am emotionally rocky (as if that wasn't perfectly obvious) and I'm always on this boat no matter the circumstances. But I do appreciate your thoughts concerning quelching the negative self-talk. That is a coping skill that does work, and indeed, I have been taught it over and over again. But again and again I choose to let my agitation overwhelm me. What I'm trying to say, is that I appreciate the reminder to use a skill that I can tend to overlook the times I need it most. Thank you, thank you. I hope you start to feel better soon (concerning your TB test situation).  Paul: Concerning your starting a blogspot blog to post comments on my blog, well thank you! But it reveals how ignorant I am of the technical aspects of running a blog. When I first started this blog, there wasn't an option to add 'comments' and I did it through haloscan so you didn't need to have a blogspot blog to post a comment. I figured blogger had just made life easier and decided to offer the option themselves. I guessed wrong.  Concerning your comment, yes, this too shall pass. And I agree, I don't like to claim the 'negative' states as being a part of me, whereas I have no problem doing so with the 'positive' ones. But I'm still very much confused and unable to picture the 'whole package of Carolyn'--and this constant struggle to overcome my despair and self-loathing seems pretty futile on these occassions. I feel as if even though I'm not 'doing anything' at the moment, that I have somehow failed. Anyway, I'm sure I'll gain some 'perspective' in the days to come. Thank you for your understanding and patience. I wish I had a better response for you.  Anyway, I'm going to try and distract my brain by diving into a Sandman comic book. Hopefully when I come to, I will have a different slant on things.  Carolyn

      Why? Why am I such a resounding failure? I just spoke on Wednesday night at the self-esteem group reunion, how my life had turned around, how I felt less volatile because of the solid 'pillar' I had managed to build for myself--my strong sense of who I was. And now it's gone. Bam! Just like that, in the blink of an eye. Am I sick? Am I a horrible person? Why can't I just be, without the torture of being kidnapped by my emotions. I feel I have alienated everyone, I feel abandoned, I feel like a real bad person. Fuck.

      Thos BPD related ads at the top of my page are starting to haunt me. I have real identiy issues--in almost every aspect of my life. I know my emotions are still out of whack, and it's hard for me to know what I'm thinking. I guess that's why some subjects tend to send me over the top. Hmmm. I'm on damage control today.  I would like to take this time to declare my love for Perry Farrell.  "the sea's a very easy place/ to disappear/ to drift away/ to fall asleep/ to make your peace/ I don't know if I'll make it home tonight/ but I know I can swim/ under the tahitian moon"

      I wrote the last 3 posts with growing humiliation and anger. I'm still unsure about them. I chose to write them, to post them, because they represent a very real struggle. Yesterday was the first day within a very important time frame that I hit an obstacle in the road. I am grateful that I've been given this opportunity to grow. I acknowledge myself for not abandoning myself (no self-harm was done). Please know that the 'people' I referred to in those posts are just aspects of myself emerging. They are the passengers on my bus. There are more that you haven't met yet, that I have never formally met. They will introduce themselves tho--of that, I am sure.

      I have contacted my inner counsellor and requested an emergency consultation. For the purpose of personal amusement, my inner counsellor will herein be known as Rhonda. Our session is being recorded by The Observer.  I am sitting in a small room, pink walls, two chairs sparse but warm. I am in a t-shirt and sweatpants with big holes in them. I’m slouching on the chair, arms and legs crossed, the lines on my face turned into a deep scowl. The door is open. Rhonda walks in, big fresh faced smile, taking off her coat and scarf as she enters the room, putting down her purse as she shuts the door.  Rhonda: “Good evening Carolyn.” I give a stiff nod. Rhonda pulls the chair closer to me, sits down, leans forward, folds her hands in her lap and looks directly into my eyes. Rhonda: “So tell me what’s up.” Carolyn: “I don’t know. I’ve lost myself. I’ve lost perspective. Any perspective I once had I now feel was just a cheap façade to keep me from seeing myself for the stupid shit that I am.” Rhonda: “Uh-huh. I want you to tell me what emotions you are experiencing. What are your feelings? Can you identify them?” Carolyn: “Uhm, I think so. I can try. I feel very, very, very irritated. I feel hurt, I feel deceived. I feel inferior and deeply inadequate.” Rhonda: “Good. Now I want you to tell me what you are thinking. What are the thoughts connected to these feelings?” Carolyn: “Hmmm. I think that I am not a rational thinker, that I have very little intellectual ability. Because of this, I have little to nothing to offer the world.” Rhonda: “Good, I’m glad you were able to connect your feelings of inadequacy with your thoughts of not contributing to the world. Now I’m going to ask you some questions, and I’d like you to answer them as honestly as possible. Why did you first choose to become a vegetarian?” Carolyn: “I chose to become a vegetarian because I feel a connection with animals. I think we share many characteristics that are widely thought of as uniquely human. Animals have the capacity to sense, to feel emotions, to connect with other beings. Animals have great capacity for compassion. It is through careful observation of their actions that their autonomy and uniqueness are revealed. I could not rationalize exploiting animals, or condoning the cruelty and disregard that so many humans have for them. I would never, ever wish harm done upon them, as I would never wish harm done upon humans. Few humans acknowledge, cherish and respect life, as I feel it should be acknowledged, cherished and respected.” Rhonda is sitting back in her chair, her legs crossed, a sly smile forming on her countenance. Rhonda: “I would like you to consider what this reveals about you as a person.” Carolyn: “Hmmm. I don’t know. I’m a sentimental idiot?” Rhonda: “No. Carolyn, you make decisions based on YOUR experience of the world. Based on the decisions you’ve made, do you think you are a compassionate person?” Carolyn: “Ahm…well….” Rhonda: “Do you think you are being true to yourself by asserting your beliefs, your values, by choosing to be a vegan?” Carolyn: “Well, I guess so, but…” Rhonda: “Okay. Do you think that compassion is the language of the heart?” Carolyn: “Yes.” Rhonda: “Do you see any value in compassion as a contribution to the world?” Carolyn: “Yes.” Rhonda: “Do you think you contribute to the world by being an intuitive thinker? By having the rare and precious ability to accept and express compassion?” Carolyn: “um…” Rhonda: “Answer from your heart.” Carolyn: “Yes.” Rhonda: “Now, I’m going to ask you some questions, and I want you to continue to seek the answers in your heart. Are you stupid?” Carolyn: “No.” Rhonda: “Do you have something to contribute to the world?” Carolyn: “Yes.” Rhonda: “Are you able to contribute by being true to yourself—by being compassionate?” Carolyn: “Yes.”

      Dear person inside my brain (you know who you are): Fuck you, fuck off, I don't need you anymore. You are oh-so-fucking-smart, and somehow you think that makes up for the foul energy from which you were divined and that you continue to manifest, to force to blossom by your soulful superiority. Fuck me in the brain ya little shit. You're driving me--insane.  That's it. I'm going to take a shower now. Don't worry. I know karate. I can take him.

      Hmmm. I'm attempting to sort my thoughts from my feelings but it's proving difficult for me at the moment. My little cat Twinkle is lying on the blanket I've placed on my desk, and that brings me a sense of calm and love.  "Oh good Carolyn. It's good that you've managed to calm down. Good that you've accepted your idiocy, your emotional immaturity. Good that despite the ultimate absence of intellectual capacity, you are still managing to live with yourself. Cause if you weren't able to live with yourself, I'd have to come up with a good excuse to miss your funeral. And that would just be such a waste of my time. Because any time I spend in connection with you is an ultimate loss to the universe."  Sigh. He is with me again. That voice that just doesn't stop. I can lower the volume, but what's the use? He knows I know that he's there.  "Or maybe I would go to your funeral. I could wear my mask of divine Love. I could shed a tear or two, wear that suit that's just been sitting in my closet. Yes, that is what I will do. Because I know the base aspects of who you are emerging at the thought, and that simply delights me! I don't appreciate that you are transcribing. You're just not fucking smart enough to accurately depict what it is that I am saying."  It is abuse, and I'm trying to deal with it by counteracting this voice with actions of peace and love. But I feel that desire stirring up inside me. That desire to cut deeply into flesh, to stab so hard I bruise my bone, to scream and bleed and purge the Virus from my system. And he would leave me. Not for very long, tho.  Let me cherish and celebrate the day. Let me fulfill a prophecy of Peace and Light. Let me know a deep love for life, from which Peace and Light will grow.

      I've been running around like a headless chicken this morning trying to get everything done for tonight. In about half an hour I have a tele-meeting with Jeannie. And then it's off to the hospital where I attended the self-esteem seminar--looking forward to seeing the ladies again. But I have to give a mini presentation on this book (doesn't sound like a big deal, I know, but when your speaking skills are as bad as mine, you gotta think of this in advance), and I made cookies, of course, little 'ol swell teacher's-pet-perfectionist Carolyn.  Ethan I will write you (that is not a threat). I gotta go.

      Last night I read my brother's past blogs (I still have to e-mail him) and found myself crying hard through most of them...not that they were sad. I was just experiencing that strange mix of intense joy and pain that has been releasing itself within me as of late. I saw how similar certain aspects of our lives are--how he has had many of the revelations that I am starting to experience and accept. And, oddly enough, we've experienced them in approximately the same time frame--he started blogging when he was 23 as well. In my opinion, we even express ourselves in very similar fashions. I hope that we will become closer on account of this. I feel a deeply innate connection to him. I will also try to get him blogging again!  This morning I worked on some of the homework assigned to me by Jeannie (my life-coach). Mainly on clearly defining my values, as well as my intentions. It is more difficult than I imagined, and my 'intentions' are at an early, confused, rambling stage.  I will share them once I have something that resembles a rough draft.

      To be at the dog park was difficult. Not that it's all about the people, lets have no illusions, it can't not be about the people no matter the number of dogs. There's been a rash of violence at the park which is actually the property of an elementary school. Terrible stuff, death threats to teachers, smashing the glass entryway and windows. Well, apparently the uniformed authority nabbed a few 13 year old kids playing in the playground with a large container of gasoline, a plastic slide already ignited. These kids need help. That got people talking about their children (their boys), and about how some of them had been bullied. But luckily, thank the heavens, they "grew out" of their timidness and not only stand up for themselves but "ya wouldn't want to cross them when they're angry." They were happy and proud that their children had gained a sense of entitlement, and encouraged their blossoming aggression. I'm not a mother, but if I was, yes, I'd be absolutely terrified to send my child into the world, especially with vulnerability exposed. But surely there is a better answer than deffensive aggression? I don't know, I don't claim to have any idea what I'm talking about. Just a thought.

      Last night under the moon when I didn't end at my feet but spread across the surface of the earth so that I was no more. This morning when I could actually hear the rustle of the breeze above the awakening suburban din. And now people are out, mowing their lawns. The sun is out, I'm grateful for that. My Babcia's favorite flower is the sunflower. My Dziadzio used to grow them with the vegetables in the yard. My mom and her sister and brother would fight over who got to keep the heads. I understand all this now. I had to go up and feel those petals, so bright and happy and trusting in the goodness of the world, as if where it stands is the finest place on the face of the earth. I would have fought for those heads as well. Border collie Risky's heart burst with joy this morning, and she tore around the yard like a puppy, stopping occasionally to madly dig a hole, or grab a stick, or roll around on the grass, or smell something new. She is getting restless, anticipating our visit to the park to meet with her friends, both the canine and human variety. Time to go.

      Balance. I need it. Don't have it yet.
