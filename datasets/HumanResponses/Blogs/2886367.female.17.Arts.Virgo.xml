       You say I'm a dreamer..    I feel so torn up inside. I feel as though I could curl up in a corner and just break down, and cry until life leaves my body but I don't, I can't, that's one controlled thing I just can't let happen, because I don't know if I would be able to make myself stop. I don't know what to think or say anymore. I don't know what emotions I'm feeling half the time that I'm feeling anything, and I don't know what to think about it. I'm afraid of sitting back and letting things happen and passing up the chance to make even a slight impact on how my life will run its course. I'm afraid of giving up.  But at the same time I'm afraid of sitting here in this white noise, with no direction at all, and waiting for something to hit me in the face.   Kind of like standing on a lonely corner beneath the musty light of a street lamp at 3am in a downpour, with the occasional car driving by.  Or like sitting in grandmum's attic after she died, lissening to oldies on her radio and watching the sun sink behind the hills through the dusty windowpanes, and being the sole person in the house.  Or sitting atop a very large hill and watching civilization crawl by without you, with everyone running around everywhere like frenzied ants, and you're perfectly still, just watching it all.  Or that you're walking down a congested hallway in school, but you're not "actually" there, and everyone just kind of warps around you as you make your way down the tunnel.. never really acknowledging you, never bumping into you.. just kind of merging almost liquid-like around you. You don't hear any noise, but you see everything. Like it's all in slow motion. Like the vision is sometimes slowly and sometimes fast spinning around you, and someone's got the remote and they're hitting the pause button and the fast-forward button at random intervals for random amounts of time. Like you're never facing the same direction for more then a few moments, and will never face that same exact direction again, because you're always being pushed to face something new.  I want to escape it all but at the same time I don't, I'm curious, and I want to figure it out. If I escape it will be like giving up. I don't want to give up. I want to finish school, and become a cartoonist/animator, and do all these other things.   I don't want to drive metal into my arms 'till they bleed, or go back to the hospital and sit in the sickeningly sterile white rooms and talk to the annoying clipboard people.   Its like everything's surreal. Like none of it's really happening.. but at the same time everything's moving so fast, everything's so painfully real that you've got to give it everything you've got to keep up and not be left behind.  I don't know.. I should probably sleep.. if there was one sole thing I would change about me, ever at all in the whole world in my whole lifetime, I'd get rid of the nightmares. That would be the one thing I could live happily without, and never regret, and never think back and say "Well I could learn from them so.. ".. but they're there, and they're going to stay there for as long as they like.   Wish I had someone to talk to but at the same time, I don't know what I would say. -.-  To whoever said I could call them whenever, or whatever you said, I thank you but I feel horridly disgustingly bad about calling people at 3am.. it just kinda makes me cringe [in other words, I'll probly never ever call anyone at 3am]. Thanks anyways.

       Shyin' away..    current music: [forgot the band] - take on me current mood: seething, stunned, meh  I don't deal with silence very well. If we're driving in a car, and there's absolute silence.. no music.. no nothing, I spaz. I just can't do it. I don't deal with friends hurting themselves and frying their brains very well either, or using such methods as "escapes." I can't really say much against it, though, because I chopped my hands up pretty good myself, but I can't just sit back and watch it happen and not say anything. Even if it makes me something of a hypocrite.  When they sit there and say "No its okay, I don't want help just more alchohol" I'm highly tempted to go ram my fist into their face. Alcohol is a sad escape. If you want to go get drunk off your ass, heave your guts up every morning and really insist on turning yourself into a brainless, liquor-addicted zombie.. just dont fucking apologize, unless you really intend to change your ways.. apologies mean nothing if you just say them out of the blue.  It makes me incredibly frustrated trying to turn someone away from that.   But its your life. Its your health. And its your choice.   It just drives me insane sitting back and watching it all.

       "You forgot again, didn't you?"   current music: anastasia - in the dark of the night current mood: wanderlust, restless, dejected  Methinks it hurt less when I was single then when I was in a relationship at all.. I'm starting to wonder if I should even bother trying anymore, to get people to acknowledge that I'm alive somewhere and still kicking.   As for now I'm gona go bike down to the cemetary I think.. tomarrow I might sit on bart all day and see where it goes. Just gotta give myself that extra kick in the end and poke my mind so I get off and go home, and not end up in some random remote location like last time, heh.  Ah, well..

       One of my fav. songs..     Hold Me Now   I have a picture pinned to my wall An image of you and of me and we're laughing With love at it all But look at our life now, we're tattered and torn We fuss and we fight and delight in the tears That we cry until dawn  Hold me now Warm my heart Stay with me Let lovin' start, let lovin' start  You say I'm a dreamer, we're two of a kind Both of us searching for some perfect world we know we'll never find So perhaps I should leave here, yeah, go far away But you know that there's nowhere that I'd rather be Then with you here today  Hold me now Warm my heart Stay with me Let lovin' start, let lovin' start  You ask if I love you, well, what can I say? You know that I do and that this is just one of those games that we play So I'll sing you a new song, please don't cry anymore I'll even ask your forgiveness though I don't know just what I'm asking it for  Hold me now Warm my heart Stay with me Let lovin' start, let lovin' start

       School needs to have one of those goverment warning labels. Y'know, those that say "Warning, this will majorly fuck with your life."   current music: buggles - video killed the radio star current mood: non.. "umphy".. I guess  So I guess my "umph" is gone. It'll come back, I'm sure.. whenever it feels like returning.  Bastardish stalker guy at school tried to feel me up, so I kicked him in the nuts. I don't know what he said, because I turned around and walked away, but I hope he's got major problems down there for awhile. His fault.. he shouldent have gotten so close.  Got an application to work at another vet's office while I was there earlyer with my dog. Ran into a chick I knew back in 5th grade - yeah small world huh - and she's working to be a vet, and it was really interesting.   Ah well.. back to finishing up my book. I got it at safeway, and it's surprisingly good.

       I know I lost, please let me suffer in silence.. I've said enough, please let me hide from the ghosts from my past for awhile..    current music: tears for fears - head over heels current mood: i feel exposed and its not a happy feeling  I know I've posted alot today but I've been thinking alot, and when I think I write, because to keep it cooped up inside just makes it worse. I spent a great deal of time talking to Bennett, and I caught myself thinking, if I grew my nails out and acted more like him would she like me more? Or am I fine just the way I am? He brought me around to the conclusion that I could never pull it off, and in my heart I wouldn't want to.   I don't know, I feel hideously upset right now, the whole sadist/masochist thing scares the hell out of me, and knowing that and admitting it makes me feel weak; the only view I have seen from it was mostly in red, from all the blood. All I feel when I'm around it is pain and fear, and I hate it. -.-  I don't know.. I want to draw but I'm afraid of what the pencil would show. I wish I could talk to someone but I don't know what I'd say.

       No Subject.. Just the usual crappyness..    current music: 3rd eye blind - jumper current mood: i want to curl up in a little ball and just forget about the world for awhile  I dunno, I'm actually kind of afraid of putting this rant down (if thats what you want to think of it as) because I'm afraid of what the people who read my journal will think of  me  and for some stupid reason it bothers me. And then I remember that a journal is yours to put down whatever thoughts or feelings or anything else you want.. regardless of what other people think. I can name at least one person who would respond to this whole post with "Oh my fucking god, why the fuck are you  still  whining? Just shut the fuck up, bitch." *sigh*  Today sucked.   .. I had originally planned on adding a bit more then that, to tell you the truth. But the motivation to write it (if indeed it required this.. "motivation".. in the first place) fled as soon as the sentence ended.   I do have one thing to say, though. Waiting all day for a phone call and then when night rolls around and the phone still hasent rung, and your head is muggy and you can't feel your eyes and you're hideously exhausted from seizures from the allergic reaction you had from the stuff they put in your eyes.. its damn frustrating.

       You'll Be Just Fine   current music: my mind indulging itself in the book i got from safeway current mood: out of it  All my emotions bottled up inside They peek out through scars on the backs of my hands I figure keep it all locked within and eventually it will all dissappear Just forget about it and don't worry 'till they stick the IV in your arm Its really not all that bad  Just put on a face everyday and hold it in place Don't let them see past it and you're set for awhile Don't let it fall you'll be fine for now 'till you seclude yourself in a corner and let it all break down Just don't let anybody see and you'll be just fine Take a walk in the rain No one can see the pain It can be excused for now Should've fought back A moment of weakness That's all they need The deed is done you can't reverse it Don't worry forget about it keep it all in  You'll be just fine.

       "I was just trying to create a dialogue.. you know, a conversation." "Normal conversations usually don't include you screaming at me for nothing."   current music: annoying people in class current mood: dazed, i feel like passing out  Apparently theres nothing wrong (at the moment anyway) with my eyes but theres a helluva good chance I could develop a detached cornea, something like that, later on..   Yesh.. well against all odds I'm at school, they put all this weird crap in my eyes so now their hella numb and dialated >  Ugh.. regretting going to school in the first place but whatever I'm here now so I gotta stay here -.-  If you ever wanna really torture me.. just tie me down and shine a bright light in my face.   *crawls away to rot in a corner somewhere*  Whatever the hell they put in my eyes is draining down my throat and I'm feeling hella shitty o.o

       [On the way home from con]"So have we left Santa Cruz yet?" [Long stretch of silence.] "We were in Santa ROSA, not Santa CRUZ." [10 minutes later] "Ohhhhhhhhhhh yeaaaaaaahhh.. " [[Hehe, I need more sleep 0_o]]   current music: marilyn manson - beautiful people current mood: happy, motivated, tired  Woke up this morning at 4am and found I've got an unnatural amount of motivation, and I'm unnaturally uberly happy, so I'm going to take advantage of these odd happenings and work on some things;  --getting liscence and a car --getting a job --honing my artwork more so i can become better at it --working my ass off so sr. year can hurry up and end --finding some free time so i can get my website up and running (which will probably never happen, with my procrastination issues lol)  Strangely I'm not as tired as I thought I'd be, I'm a little mulled but I've been thinking alot so thats probly why.  Anywho I'm in class, oughta go..      &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     urlLink Marriage is love.        Ahhh nuuuuu the tiredness is creeping back.. [[not sleepy-tired, just sore-tired ^^;]] My right eye hurts like a bitch, I think I might've gotten hit with something, but I dunno, because my vision is majorly screwed in that eye and its always fuzzy >

       L is for the way you look at me, O is for the only one I see..    current music: ani defranco - both hands current mood: contemplative  I used to have one of these awhile ago and then I switched to Dead/LiveJournal, and now I'm back to this, at least for posts that I'm reluctant to have some people read.  This weekend was election con, and it kicked alot of ass, and I didn't think I'd have as much fun as I ended up having. Late Saturday morning I was having some regrets about going actually, and was contemplating leaving and not staying the whole time [looking back, I don't know what I was thinking, and I'm hella glad I stayed].   I met alot of new people and managed not to get too overwhelmed with such a large group, and made some new friends, which was very good, that never comes too easily for me. I met a truely awesome person, Char/Charlotte, [dunno how to spell your name, I'm sorry ^^;;] and it was very cool, and very interesting.   Been very contemplative since I left yesterday, been thinking alot over events and such. Methinks after this I'm going to give up on guys, I'm tired of being violated and pushed beyond my limits,  and just stick to girls; as of date nothing truely horrible has happened when in company of them =)   I want to write more but I don't know how to put words to my thoughts. I think I'm going to find some way to stay home today, and just think stuff over 0_o   Thats all I spose; if your reading this feel free to ask about anything, I dun't mind ;p

      im afraid that no one will love me for who i am instead of how i act and the image i give them, im afraid that they will always end up walking out on me and leaving me in the dark because im not interesting enough or they found someone better, im afraid of opening myself up to them, that they might be able to use it against me sometime in the future, and im afraid to love because when they leave in the end it just hurts so bad  .. but im also afraid of not taking a chance, because to not love anything scares me most of all.

      current mood: offended, pissed off, tired (mentally, and with other people), confused, contemplative  Hum well my friend popped on and we started talking about what were doing after HS and I told her I'm going to be working all summer to start raising money so I can move out, to get away from my dad and all the shit he gives me, and for other reasons, and she FREAKED, she is the only one to have freaked when I told them this, and went off on me on how its a bad idea and disaster and evilness and stupidness and I'm not ready for it, its a big world out there, etc etc etc and proceeded to push her opinions and erase mine and get me to do things her way, and she got pissed off when I told her I can't, thats just the way things work.  I feel like someone smacked me in the face and called me an idiot for living the life I live, but things just kind of happen the way they do and sometimes theres just not much you can do about it. It offends me when people push aside that explanation and keep pressing for me to follow their opinions because they think theres a better way and sometimes there just isn't.  Should I not have said anything in the first place, and avoided the question entirely, then?

       "Well.. they're dead.. ish."   current music: meatloaf - hot summer night current mood: hooooooo boy, buncha moods.. happy,  nostalgic, lost, stressed, confused, the list can go on..   "Are actually planning on getting a cat o ninetails?" "I plan on it." "Barbs or no?" "No barbs. I'm a sadist not a hitman." "Good to know."  Hurrr... so he's  really  probably gonna get one. I'm a little scared. *L*  Also.. going to see Marina.. am I flying by myself? Cause I'm  NOT  flying 3000 bloody fucking miles ON MY OWN. *hides* But I didn't pay 300 for nothing.. ARGH stupid non transferable/refundable plane tix *growls*  Yesterday I went to see Dawn of the Dead with Liane, and that is the first movie to date that I have EVER been carded for. ARGH.  "You don't look like you're 17. Go away." "Lady, I'm 17." "I need to see some I.D."  I pulled out my school i.d., my medi card, and many other odds and ends. She ended up glaring, raving at me for a good 10 minutes and then FINALLY letting me get my ticket and move on, because there was a lot of people behind me. And Liane didn't get shit and shes shorter AND a year younger (no offense to you *hug!*)!! ARGHHHH some people..  Wee, time to go!

       "Are those mushrooms.. singing?" "Yes.. yes they are."   current music: really really slow, soft stuff from enya and other calming whatnots current mood: REALLY uber SQUEE fuckin happy, really tired, and disgustingly overwhelmed  Spent the day today in Berkly with Fonzy and met alot of his friends. And it was uber awesome. He came to the Walnut Creek bart and met my dad (who practicly interrogated him for a half hour on his name, number, address, where we were going, what we were going to do, bla bla bla, it was annoying, my dad was a real prick to me today, and to other people in general, I hate it when he's like that.. but ANYWAY), and then we finally escaped and hopped on bart and ended up in Berkly.  We then proceeded to a park and met up with some friends of his, and then went to a gaming store, and hung out there for awhile, and then went BACK to said park, and by this time the school had let out and there was a fucking LOT of people there, all running around and screaming and yelling and it was very.. "whoa".. and then we met more of his friends there and proceeded to migrate to another person's house  and then there was snuggling and zoning and sleeping and watching of the tv (i dont have a great interest in tv shows.. movies are great if they're interesting but tv.. nah.. so i zoned, and got bitten on, hehe) and some scandelousness hehe and then i had to go home  and im incredibly tired (and cold) but im also stuffed to the brim with so much anxiety that i feel sick, because the day in itself while fun was also grossly overwelming, and i felt very pressed with how freely i could express myself around people i didnt know, and also very stressed. so.. it was a good day.. but right now the panicy stressed seizureness is overwhelming the happyness, until it dies down and i can chill.. meybe ill go watch fox and the hound again, or 10th kingdom

        "Butter wouldn't melt in my mouth! Well.. it would melt.. of course it would melt.. but very slowly."   current music: kmfdm - apathy current mood: torn  Well this friday I'm either going to openly defy my parents and WALK to the fucking bart station, or be a crafty little bitch and decide to leave too late into the evening that I couldn't get home if I wanted to.  She says I can't stay there cause she doesn't know my friends and its a stupid idea but  I  know them, and if she took even the SLIGHTEST fucking interesting in my life and take ONE moment to look at me instead of THROUGH me, meybe she WOULD. But she won't. She says she fucking cares but she doesn't make the effort.  Personally, I don't want to walk to bart. I really don't. Thats a LONG way to walk. More then 10 miles, and my knees aren't going to put up with that. Nor do I want to just walk out and leave. As mad as I am at them I don't want to just up and leave, I guess I'm just stupid like that. But I don't want them riding bart with me and hanging around me in Berkly Friday, either. *shudder* Methinks I'll move them about till they just drop me off, I still need to ask Oni on which place I'm sposed to get off bart.. it will be interesting.  Also.. apparently Bennett can't go to NC in April? Crap. I do NOT want to fly 3000 miles by myself. I would die. Argh..   I should go to bed, I really should.. I didn't sleep  at all  last night, which wasn't cool. Meh.  Watching 10th Kingdom for the bajillionth time ^^

       Disturbing dream I had.. just when I thought I wouldn't dream anymore I did. Ugh.   My hands flew to my heart, hearing my father scream like that. The cry of his victim, the slamming of a door, and all was still. I was left with my thoughts.  Silent as I could, I gathered an extra shirt, another pair of pants, my knives, what little money I had left, and stole a loaf of stale bread from the kitchen. Stuffing the items into my pack, I slipped out the back door to the alleyway. I Tripped on last step, and my shoes scuffed loudly on the pavement. I winced, and bit back a cry of surprise. Twisting violently to my left to avoid collision with the neighbor's trashcan, I sped down the back path, flying around the corner a bit too fast and came skidding to a stop.   [...]  I was crouched down between the old sofa and the coffee table, my pack nestled between my stomach and my skinny legs, my hands clutched my knees as a form drew near. Mother's scowling eyes bored into mine. I flinched. Her voice, cold, like always.   "Don't expect pity, you stupid brat. Just get the fuck out of here."  "But.. my dog.. "  My own. Wavering. Control slipping.   "He's going back to the shelter. Or he's getting killed."  A pause. She knew my weak point, perhaps even better then I did. I sniffed. Blinked back tears. I loved my dog. More than life itself. But I knew I couldn't take him with me. I didn't have the money for his food, and he would probably end up starving. I looked back up to see her face, but she had gone.  [...]  Now I stumble along the small strip of concrete near the edge of a freeway. I have to concentrate, to avoid stepping out into traffic and getting hit by a car. My loaf of bread was long gone. Slipping to the side, I hopped the side rail and half rolled half stumbled down the steep embankment on the other side. A withered hotel was standing there. It's paint was faded. It was the kind that nobody would look twice at, and would rather sleep in their car then ask for a room. I knew better. I had no car. Knocking on the glass panes in the front, I gritted my teeth and tried to stand up straight. A man answered the door, causing a wave of fear to wash over me. I struggled to keep my composure and asked in a scratchy voice if I could use the shower, and the laundromat, to wash myself and my clothes.  "Be quick about it, else I'll charge you a full night's stay, and then some."  The price was rediculous, for such a rundown place. I took my pack into the bathroom with me, and locked the door. I showered, and then went to wash my clothes. I felt the man's eyes on my neck the whole time. It gave me a shivery, frightened feeling. I didn't like it. I thanked him, and left as fast as I could, not even bothering to let my clothes dry fully. They were still half damp. It was okay. I could dry them out later.  [...]    It creeps me out, its almost exactly like real life, 'cept my mum doesn't talk like that and my dad isn't going to kill my dog. But he still screams, and slams doors. This weekend I think I'm just going to escape to Berkly, and stay there overnight or something. I need to get outta here for a few days.   .. I need to talk to mum about it, hes on my case whenever she's out, which is conveniant for him because there's noone to tell him to knock it off and leave me alone. When summer gets here I'm gonna work my ass off to get monies so I can move out and get my own small place, I just wish he'd leave me alone.

       "But it's so long and skinny!"    current mood: squee current music: avril - skater boy  So today I went to Recca Con in Pittsburg, Sam gave me a ride both ways (thanks Sam! ^^) and it was cool, he picked me up around 1pm and we got there around 4 after stopping at Jack In the Box for curly fries and foodings. YUMMM curly fries are good =D Met up with Angela, Holly, Frannie, Sarah, Sarah's younger sister, and Sarah's bf. Wandered over to the dealer's room pretty much first thing and I got a wall scroll (Hack/Sign) for $12 instead of the original $15 because the dealer was cool and I didn't have enough monies.  Hung out on a bench for an hour or two and then I was introduced to Fonzy, who is an uber awesome guy, he was all decked out in spikes and straps and happy black shiny things too ^^ We had some weird sort of a dule with wall scrolls (he had one too, Lain I think) and then there was much flirting, and hitting upon, and Sam got many pics of us (or so he says 0_o.. camera = scary ^^; ), and I was told I was cute by several different people (why does everyone always say that? lol).   Then we progressed.. back to the main event room, and watched the cosplay show thing, which kind of sucked but only because we were pretty much in the back and Becky was on my lap and none of us could see/hear much of anything. After that was over I left to wander around, and by then it was late and things were winding down and I was contemplating getting myself lost (the con was held on a college campus) when I ran into Fonzy again, and I gave him 50 cents to get hot chocolate out of a coffee machine (how cool, they should have one at MV), and then we proceeded to make our way carefully down the steps to.. some sort of outdoor theater thing.  And it was dark, and there was much tripping over steps, haha, but it was still interesting, and there was kissing stuffins (yey!.. not much happened other then that actually but it was still cool ^^) and then people told me we were leaving soon so we wandered back up, and ran into Holly, who bought him some rice and stir fry, or something, and then everyone went back in to the event place to see who won the cosplay deal and he and myself went and sat on a bench and talked about random things, and then I had to leave *tear* and then Sam and I talked about sex on the way home lol.  And it was fun, and cool, and there's people screaming for some RANDOM reason outside.. and I'm waiting for someone to come online so I can talk to them. And yeah.  The end. ^^

      Another song entry..   Fatal Fury - Oh Angel  Whoa-oh, oh angel Come greet the dawn, it's a brand new day Whoa-oh, oh angel Let burn the passion that fires your soul  Each lonely night I get through without you becomes my victory Each empty night I fight against the light that is my destiny Yet, I know that having might don't mean you're right I can't be both cruel and kind When nothing makes sense I look up at the clouds in the sky They don't answer but I still ask why  Stand tall, you don't fall Even a wolf gets away Now and then run into the sun Sharpen your claws, bare your fangs and go on  Run your own race--why go for second place? Go on and grab a star You can survive, you gotta stay alive Heaven is not that far When you're on the edge you pledge to live just for today Ain't no sense livin' in the past Look ahead and you'll see that tomorrow has already come Time heals all wounds and love does go on  Stand tall, you won't fall Courage, you stumble and then So that you run into the sun Seek out those songs which have not yet been sung  People do fall in love Though they may swear that the pain won't let go forevermore I'll burn the flame of your dreams in my soul  Whoa-oh, oh angel Come greet the dawn, it's a brand new day Whoa-oh, oh angel Let burn the passion that fires your soul    Cramps suck. I oughta go to bed.

      i feel like its tearing me up again, same old feeling, only absent for a few years.. returns with a smack to the face.. it feels like im being shot over and over again in the chest and theres smoking holes boring into my heart but theres no blood to pour out.   i talked to my teacher (who is also my friend) today about what happened over summer, and i still think its my fault, if i had stayed home none of it would have happened, but i guess im just stupid like that, and then tomarrow she told me i should tell my mum about it. and im scared. im afraid. i dont want to go back on meds because shes going to think im an idiot and im fucked in the head. and im not. and nothing happened. nothing like that at all. im fine physically, and mentally im fine, aside from other things. im fine from it. im dealing just fine. im afraid to talk to her. shes going to flip. shes going to have a heart attack and die. i dont want to tell her.   but i should, because its worse not telling. its like im cheating them i guess. but i dont want them to blame themselves. -_- eegads.  meybe ill go play painkiller and shoot zombies. or draw.. or something. i dont know.  i want to leave but i dont, i want to lose myself in random places but that doesent solve anything, because when you come back to the place you left, all your problems are still sitting there waiting for you. leaving doesent solve anything. neither does dieing. drugs and drinking are stupid, they create more problems. cutting.. dont even get me started. i used to think that if i made the pain on the outside greater then that on the inside, i could forget about everything for awhile. and it worked just fine.. for the first 5 minutes.   well tomarrows going to be here in a little less then 3 hours. at least i dont hafta get up for school till noontime, cuz sophs have testing tomarrow =P

       When you feel all alone, and the world has turned its back on you..    I slept for several hours.. it felt nice. I'll probly go back to bed in a moment.   The people at the mental center let me go, they told me I was fine and I don't need to go back anymore. So why do I feel like my heart is being slowly ripped out of my chest?  I need to tell someone about it.. preferrably adult. Preferrably over 20. Someone who will lissen and not freak out. My mum isent going to believe me. Something as major as that, she will refuse to allow herself to believe, and will shut it all out. I don't want to get into a big mess about it.. I just want someone to lissen. I don't want to go to the police and track him down and throw him in jail, or anything major.. I just want someone to talk to. If it happens again I'll go to the police. I just wish I could talk to someone.. its tearing me up inside, I've been denying it so long and reality is starting to slowly crack the glass.   If I had stayed home that day, it wouldn't have happened. None of this would have happened, and everything would be just fine.  I miss peter so, so much. 0_o I saw him for a few hours on saturday, we went and saw Starsky and Hutch, and then I had to leave cuz my parents were going to San Fran and he had to go home for some reason. I haven't gotten to talk to him since. I feel like I don't exist in his little world unless I call him and say hi, and because I'm curse with horrible timing when I call people [you know it's true], he's always got people over and so he can almost never talk. Chilling with him for a bit this previous Saturday was the first time I got to see him since before Con. -_-  I don't want to tackle the world tomarrow. I don't want to try and hold my "just fine" face in place and try to keep everything looking just fine. I'm a wimp. I just don't want to struggle through it all again tomarrow.  Off to bed, if I dream.. I don't give a fuck.

       Look right through me..    current mood: wondering WHY my brain is still functioning when I haven't actually slept in over two weeks current music: the movie, save the last dance  Well.. mum has finally come to the conclusion that she wants to put me on meds because I've got some horrid insomnia [all thanks to being afraid to dream] and I haven't, technically, gotten any sleep since con, wherein I felt relatively comfortable with the people around me, enough that I could risk letting my mind fade and my subconscious rule.   I'm all for it, really, with the exception that I'll be too drugged to wake myself up [ha, since when have I ever been able to do that?] to get out of the dream.  Dilemma.  Knowing my rents, whenever I'm not cooperating, mum has this sickening knack of telling on me to her husband, who then gets nasty enough that I either leave or subside to doing just what she wants..   .. So I'll probly be giving in and taking the damn meds.   Great.

       Look at our life now, we're tattered and torn..    current mood: thinking ^^ current music: tears for fears - everybody wants to rule the world  What if we could change the way we were brought up -- the events that would happen, the words that would be said -- and all that jazz? Would it have an impact on how we look at the world now?  If you could choose your parents.. would they be different from the ones you have now? Would it matter? Is there any parental influence or is it mostly just society?  School changes the way we act; -- socially acceptable, etc -- is there a difference between private and public schools? Does it matter?  If we had never met another human being.. never had any past experiences to create memories and learn from.. never had to struggle our way through schoo and society [much like trying to run through a waist-deep pool of molasses]..   What would we be like today?

       "Go on in and lie down, the medication will take effect soon and you'll be dead shortly."   Bloody hell, I'm posting alot lately. Wanderlust hitting me in the head again, ugh. Meybe tomarrow I'll go out and do some quality go-pedding, now that I've got a new break cable.   Ah well I did say I'd post a dream here if I could find one.. so here goes something, I guess.  As the nighttime breeze blew around my body, sending cold, unwelcome chills down the length of my spine, I shudddered, my brain flashing through that brief, frozen state your mind enters as your ears take on the sound of sharp nails grating down the length of a chalkboard. My eyes teared up, my vision becoming blurry; I blinked, vainly trying to clear my lign of sight so I would be able to return to normal visibility. The space around me, seemingly frozen as if time had stopped, it's movements locked in a block of cement someone had carelessly discarded by the side of the road. As my eyes cleared my mind became aware of no other noises around me; the silence was deafening, the stillness of it all pressing in on my eardrums, until it reached an almost unbearable point and I wondered if my skull would burst from the intensity of the whole experience. Suddenly my world was moving, rapidly rushing upwards as my eyes rolled up into their eye sockets, my vision suddenly obscurred by the top of my brow, my breath seeming to catch in my throat. I panicked. My mind raced as adrenaline flowed down the tiny yet still vast pathways of my nerves, my body beginning to tremble.  The sudden pull of gravity laced it's fingers around my body, entwining myself almost inseperably within its grasp, slowly at first, but gradually building speed - how fast I didn't know - causing me to tumble backwards, the shadow of my landing already broadening on the earth below. My wings beat the air, desperately, uselessly, at a failing attempt to return to my perch. Had I had hands, my fingers would be extended, forever reaching towards the lost pieces of wood that made up my chair - always stretching to close those last few inches, but in the end they would never connect. In my mind, the outcome had already become the final answer - I would never regain my feet upon the landing in my past. My body refused to accept it. Chilly winds blew through my ruffled feathers, my skin turning to ice. A terrified shriek filled the air as the rest of me accepted my doom. The noise was like that of a doomed rabbit, flailing helplessly in an owl's grasp, it's red blood, hot and steaming in the cold night air, seeping through the raptor's claws to pool onto the ground now far below, it's life falling with nothing to grasp it back into the rabbit's now-stone cold being.  A dull thump, as though someone had carelessly dropped a stack of papers upon the floor, jarred my body roughly, carelessly. Flashing dots and bright lights made their way into my vision as the air was knocked from my lungs from the unforgiving landing. The lids of my eyes squeezed shut this time, myself making a feeble effort to regain my lung's stolen air, as my body tensed up with the remaining adrenaline and after-impact. Wainting until I was once again able to draw a breath, now-unhindered by terror, I slowly opened my eyes, the cat-like slits widening, becoming larger to take in more of the night around me. I blinked again, objects that before were nothing more then blurred shadows were now startlingly bright, almost florescent, painfully visible by my mind's eye. The once-chilly breeze was now nothing more then a slight disturbance in the air, tickling the delicate hairs lining my inner ear; gently nudging the whiskers sprouting out from alongside my mouth into slight movement. Regaining my feet, my paw pads feeling every crumb of dirt to the moistness of the soil, I cast a final glance around me. I began moving long before I realized I was doing so, my body flowing with time, hardly stepping out of beat. My shadow merged with those in the distance, no sound was ever emitted - there was no need for one to be, no purpose. The silence was welcome, anything else would have been regarded by my brain as decreetly annoying. As I padded off into the night, the slight realization that the quietness was not so deafening as before; moments later the thought faded from the edges of my awareness and fled out into the world.   Yeah that was kinda long *wince* I know I've got a better version somewhere. When I find it, I'll edit this one. Enjoy.

       "Your bones have been my bedframe, and your flesh has been my pillow.. "   current mood: still pretty damn tired..  current music: new radicals - you get what you give   I had a pretty crazy dream last night.. I  drowned.  And it was weird! Very weird..   Got about two hours, meybe two and a few minutes, of sleep. If this keeps up as it is I'm going to go insane long before April rolls around and I fly out to see Marina. *eye twitch*   I dunno what else to put, really. My computer is finally fixed *happy dance*.. and its running beautifully ^^. The guy that came to fix it was weird, I think I've seen him someplace before, I just can't remember. But still neat, cuz he helped me fix my comp, and I don't need to jab it with pointy objects anymore. Woo.  Eh.. back to drawing. And wondering when I'm getting surgery for my back. Or whatever the hell they're going to do.  Oh yeah.. my dog's tooth is half ripped out 0_o He won't eat, and he's very down, so he's going off to the vet's tomarrow.

       "Did you just burn your tongue on a cookie?" ".. Yes." "HA!!"   current mood: tired enough to half expect my brain to shut off and my heart to stop working current music: all the annoying freshman people in this class jabbering nonsense  I'm still alive. I swear. I'm just very tired. And busy. With school. But I'm still drawing. My computer died, a person is going to come out and take a look at it today and see if its fixable. *crosses fingers* I hope it is. If its not, mum said I could meybe somehow get a laptop. Tha'd be cool. And  portable . And I could take it with me to Marina's in April. And.. yeah. Stuff.  I told my art teacher I wanted to be a cartoonist, and she asked what I'd do the comic on, and my friend said I should do a daily (or every other day, or whenever) one-cell comic showing all the bad luck, accident-prone shit that happens to me everyday. ^^; Like yesterday.. I burned my tongue on a cookie. And last week, when the guy slammed the door into my face. Yesh.. so apparently I'm doing a comic about all that. When I get around to it.   I have... 3-5 drawings left to do before middle of next month for AP Art. *dies* Two are self-portraits *groans*, two are artist's choice (I'm doing a blown up cell of a comic [2 feet by 2 feet, unless I change my mind], and some weird background landscape thing), and the other two are yet to be decided. Oh.. one of them is the room and the person deal. Which I still haven't finished. Great. And then I still have to draw up that band logo for that guy.. *face plants* If my hand falls off in the end, I won't be surprised.  Mostly I've gotten over my fear of planes.. YEY! I'm starting to think of this visiting of Marina in April as one big "Ooooooooh, the ground looks like a patchwork quilt!" kinda thing. =D   Yesterday after my shower when I was getting dressed I noticed I've got a handful of scars still on both sides of my hips/lower back, and the door was open and mum walked by and asked what they were from -.- I told her probly from the accident last summer even though that had mostly to do with my front (stomach, arms, hands, face). Oh well ^^;;   My spine is all screwy from the scholiosis, or whatever it is, so I might be having to get surgery. Which will be interesting.. I guess.   Time to go, theres 10 minutes left in class and I haven't done a damn thing. *L* 'Course there IS a sub and I DID finish my assignment yesterday.. ^^;;

      last night/this morning i was fading in and out of sleep.. yknow that place where your unconscious but still aware yet not? and it was like i was sitting half twisted looking out my window, and my dog was outside, and my rents were standing there, and all of a sudden caspy whirled around and took off, and my rents were like "oh shit" and ran after him, and i layed there looking out the window for awhile, a long while, and they didnt come back, so i freaked and woke all the way up and got out of bed, got dressed, jumped on my bike and took off after where i thought caspy had gone, and i road all over the little housing comunity area for like an hour, or something, at 6-7am, and i finally gave up, and went home, and rents were there, with my dog, and they were like "where the hell did you go, you just got up and left and didnt answer us"  and the night before that i got up to get a glass of water around 2 ish, or something, and i saw, or thought i saw, a man in the other room, and he was bleeding, and i was startled and sprinted into my room and shut the door, and i think he died, and i dont know..    i dont like to dream.. i rarely have one that isnt freaky in some way shape or form.. i dont know why.. ive been getting to bed so late its early, and then getting up a few hours later, so i DO sleep, but im not sleeping for long, i dont know.. im afraid of it, and im afraid of mirrors.. thankfuly there are no mirrors in this room, save for the small one marina gave me awhile back, from woodstock..   i dont know.. im afraid, i wish someone would hold me for awhile, and give me that sense of security i havent felt in so long.. i dont know..

       I finished my story! Its kinda long though.. well printed it only makes a little less then two pages.. anyway.. enjoy! Back to work for meee *twitch*    	Going through the motions. That's all school really is, you know. A monotone rat race. Technical and robotic down to the very last breath. Like most of the other fools here, sitting beside me at these little wooden tables, breathing in, breathing out. Blinking occasionally to keep their eyes from getting too dry. Books, papers, and pens spread out in messy piles across the surface. Voices droning on, like broken-down record players that keep repeating those last few lines, over and over again. Teacher's sharp eyes quick to catch the lazy student. 	I sat in the back of the class, huddled into my old fuzzy jacket, my head fit snugly into my worn cap. My feet curled together under the little chair attached to these desks, my arms folded across my chest, my hands withdrawn into my sleeves. They were cold, I remember. My mind tick-tocking to the voices directed in my direction, as my body tensed up, like a time bomb about to go off and shoot fire and death everywhere. 	Maybe if the teachers had paid attention, maybe if someone had paused a moment, taken a second look and noticed the madness reeking havoc in my head, behind the glassy windows of my eyes, they would have seen the wrongness surging there. They would never see, their constant taunting only feeding the abomination already chewing hungrily on my brain. My limbs had moved before the next thought left the command center. The cold steel was already in my hands, and blood had sprouted wings and taken to the air. Honestly, I didn't know quite what to think about it. At that point, my mind was almost a complete blank - a malfunctioning machine with no "off" switch, no plug to be pulled. 	When my consciousness finally pushed and shoved its way to the surface, my soul reeled at the carnage around me. Rough, brutal carnage - that's the only thing it could have been. Any sane person would have screamed. I think I tried, anyway. It was no use - no sound came out. The room was swathed in blood. Worse yet, this horrific deed was something that I myself had done, and I had barely seen it coming, didn't recognize it 'till I was in the throes of its making, unable to stop until it was complete, because I had already started. 	I don't really remember all the shiny details that fell into place after that. They took me straight to the stone cold rooms and thrust my disgusted body behind bars. Later in the threads of time I was shown to a judge, and I recall my scratchy voice pleading guilty, begging them to believe that I was the one who had committed such a henious crime as the simple slaughter of helpless classroom puppets. The man looked appalled, and I was immediately sentenced to life in prison...at least until I was old enough to be executed. Lucky, or unlucky for me, it was against the law to execute a juvenile, and no amount of time in jail could account for all of the lives that I had taken that day. 	My eyes stared dully at the old rusted bars, sitting side by side, vertically, in front of my face. Memories bombarded my brain, launched by indestructable catapults that never malfunctioned. Attaching themselves to my thoughts, their claws enabling them to hold tight to my mind, refusing to let go, to give me a simple moment's peace. I had been in this filthy place for a little over a year, now. The food had lost all actual taste, if it ever possessed any at the start. It tasted of cardboard and moldy bread. The water was a dull, dry liquid that ran down my throat to my always-empty stomach. My stare was almost always directed straight ahead, for I flatly refused to risk even the slightest glance at my hands. Hands...that had done such a horrible thing. No, it wasn't the hand's fault...it was the mind's. The disease in my brain, putting those ideas into thoughts, and finally brutally shoving those thoughts into the cracked reality that everyone was struggling tooth and claw to move through. 	I remember, vaguely, the endless numbers of people they took me to see. High-ranking psychologists, shrinks, doctors. The immense x-rays and cat scans, relentlessly scanning my brain tissue with invisible lasers, prodding, searching, shifting through the mass of fat that occupied the space in my head, above my eyes and below the small cropping of my hair.  	No one came to visit. I never had any calls, letters, or packages. My family had erased my presence from their memories, if only with a thin layer of whiteout, yet it was as if I had never existed at all. I had died and was buried in an abandoned piece of ground, my grave body-less, and my tombstone blank. None to visit, to leave flowers there, to lay sorrowful words upon the ground over my empty coffin. Resting in peace, yet not, upon a hill that had never existed. Peace itself is an understatement - there would be no peace for my corrupt soul. Limbo had my name on the first slot in the sign-in heet, and was already awaiting my arrival. The Devil himself, dressed in his cloak of fire, his staff of spikes and his horns polished to shining would be there to greet me, shake my hand, and show me to my cage of flames, where I would be tortured unto eternity. I could wait to get there. I wouldn't mind taking my time.  	When reality finally kicked my brain into waking, several years later, I found myself in the cold embrace of the executioner's chair. Surprisingly, it was comfortable. Various doctors and nurses were standing around, with a couple of guards at the door, guns resting idly on their shoulders. Not that there needed to be guards - I was strapped wrist and ankle to the chair, and couldn't have released myself, no matter how hard my mind wished it. My mind snapped to attention then, as my gaze locked itself on the long needle one of the doctors was holding in his hand. My face felt hot and wet - I didn't know it then but I was crying. My voice pleaded with them, rough and unheard, not to shove that thin piece of steel into my veins. It was like talking to a deaf man. It didn't matter how loud I got, they simply weren't going to listen to me. The worst of it was I realized I had done wrong, and i also realized that there was no one to save me...and no one to care when I was gone. The last thights I had, the last feelings I desperately clutched to with aching fingers as the tainted glow of inner life faded from my body, replaced by the shadows of death, were of despair, and hate. I didn't hate the people around me. I didn't hate the judge who had condemned me to this fatal end. I hated myself. It was hated being run through with an electrically charged sword. A bazillion volts ramming into my heart that never seemed to end. In the surrealness of death, the hate was still there, to burn forever. 	The world is a cold, cold place. You'd have to be a deaf, unseeing fool to see it otherwise. You've always got to be running, over sharp rocks, hot coals, freezing slabs of ice. There are no carpets there. Even when you've lost your shoes you've got to keep going, try to ignore the never ending dagger that stabs your mind repeatedly as your skin is sheared clean off the bottom of your feet, without so much as Novocain to dull the pain. Running away from everything simply won't cut it. The day you return, all of your problems are there waiting, crouched and ready to spring, to tear your heart from your still-breathing chest. So arm yourself with your trusty sword and sheild, strap on your armor, and get out there lad, the world's waiting, and it won't be subdued with the decent begging and pleading your soul wants to offer for a decent, easy life. That's just not the way it works these days. The axel keeps turning, even when your limbs have stopped moving. You're either spending all your energy running ahead and living life the best you can as it is meant to be lived, or you've tripped and you're slowly getting crushed to death beneath the wheels. Unfortunately for you, there are no pause buttons.   ooookay.. back to work +_+ *drags body off to slave over more homework*

      current mood: BRAINDEAD... i think i failed my econ test, but i hope not current music: jim caroll band - people who died  sleeping is possibly the most annoying need in the world for humans.. that and peeing. it would be cool, if it was like the Matrix, where you had a socket and a plug, and you'd just plug yourself into the wall and recharge that way. Of course, when humanity died out and took the power supply with it, then you'd probably be pretty screwed.   My story, "Shooting" is due tomarrow, and i haven't finished it. I'll probably get it done in resource.. and I STILL haven't worked any more on my sculpture.. I hate to abandon it but I think i might have to, so I can focus and being triply sure I pass all my classes and graduate in June..   I think I will go watch Pirates of the Carribbean, for I can't sleep (took a nap after school, though) and I haven't seen the movie in awhile  Can't wait till Dawn of the Dead comes out on DVD ^^

      haha im still here.. and i havent said anything to my parents.. nor have i cut up my arm/hand again yet.. though i would like to bleed, alot, and very soon. that would be very nice. im also very tired. and carpel tunnel sucks. wee.. back to drawing and doing stupid things like jabbing wires into my hand  i duno bleeding is nice.. its good to bleed every once and a while.. it really is  i dunno lately i  want  to go back to the hospital ward, just to get away from it all, because i have nowhere else to go. i dunno. usually i think about escaping and visiting someone while im running around being lost.. but not this time. i dunno im too afraid im gona slip and do something really, really stupid. i dunno. sunday/monday were good. very good. very fun. but then the distractions left and i was back to thinking, and having nothing to draw my attention away to. believe me.. i spent today being a music whore. i rented kill bill and watched it 4-5 times. the movie would play, and id watch it, and as soon as the credits showed up id stop it and start it over again at the beginning. monotone. kind of scary. i certainly creeped my dad out.   i revamped my DJ and LJ, made a new icon, and updated fresh icons. i did colt's DJ background for him, and got that posted. i spent a little more then 2 hours on a picture, recoloring it and cleaning it up, to use as a background for LJ. I started another picture (angsty and depressing) and im almost done with it. i also ate something. a sandwhich. and i have a big glass of canada dry gingerale in front of me. i went to the store and got more shampoo, and a brace for my wrist, because carpel tunnel sucks. and i read more of the autobiography of malcolm x. i was being accomplished today. i did stuff.  tomarrow at 2pm dad and i (hes being a major prick right now but he DID tell me he'd give me a lift to the wind caves, so i cant complain, even though hes saying alot of things he shouldnt) are going to pick up bennett, bennett's gf diane, and peter, at bennett's house tomarrow, and the 5 of us are gonna run around in rock city while my dad does whatever the hell he does.. probly leave us there and come back later. i will have a distraction tomarrow. i will be back by 6 id assume, i have to work with the neighbors dog at 7pm. i wont have to sit here all day and contemplate stupid thoughts and get yelled at over nothing. it might rain tomarrow.. but were going to go up there rain or shine. it will be nice.  but i dunno. i hate to admit this -- i REALLY hate to admit this -- but i miss casey. it was one helluvan abusive relationship, but i miss it. he is, thus far, the only person that knows as much about me as i have given the world to know. he is one of the very few people who knows exactly how i will react to whatever i am faced with. i miss him. i miss being able to love on him, and getting love in return. my parents are there. but theres no parent-child bond you see in most families. it doesnt exist. i dont know. im confused. i miss him and i hate him. hate, for deceiving me for as long as he did and for all the things he said. but i still miss him. i dont know. i think when i start saying i miss him that there is something really wrong with me, i dont know.   i dont want to be suicidal again, it isent fun, but i dont know. i cut because i say i want to feel.. now i cut because i want to bleed. just bleed and bleed and bleed. i hate drugs but now i say i want to get my hands on valium, to stop feeling. i dont know. i thought i was getting better. i got released from the center, and everything was peache' fine. and then everything crashed back down, and i dont know how it happened. its like being on the stupid pills they give you, and then you get addicted to fake happiness and you figure your just fine so you stop the meds and your back to the start. your screwed. i dont know.   i want to be okay again i want to be able to say im good and actually MEAN it when people ask how i am i dont want to keep saying im okay but its always a lie, i dont know im just stupid i guess  if i go back to the hospital and they ask why im in there and i tell them because im being suicidal and cutting and they ask why and i tell them i dont know then it will be interesting and mum will look at me with the same guilt in her eyes she always has and run home to email the tons of people she knows and tell them every detail that happens and when these people see me next they will look at me with that same guilt or with a different face entirely and it will be awkward and i will be anti social and dad will study me like a scientist studies a new species always contemplating analyzing testing what makes it tick what bothers it how can you get it to break down and die i hate it when he looks at me like that its wrong and the doctors will look at me with their clipboards and pens and sterile rooms and big doors and long halls and it will be the same as always again  and i hate it

      i think i need to draw either more or less often  im going back to the center on monday (next) i believe, to talk to the lady. that will be interesting. shes gona be peeved at me, but thats okay.   when i go in i want to ask her about valium.  for the past week/2 weeks ive been thinking about getting myself put on it.. because i dont want to feel anything anymore, but i dont want to die. but then id be a hypocrite, or something, because part of the reason i cut is i want to feel. i hate drugs too. sigh.  i dont want to go back to the hospital but i dunno i think i should, im afraid im going to do something really really stupid and bad that i wont be able to undo it, and that will be it. i dunno, im really confused.  im feeling better, far less sickish which is good but meh i dont know, my mind doesent feel better, i keep wondering why i cant just shove everything away and be happy all the time, im getting sick of feeling like this and i bet people are getting sick of hearing about it.  well back to bed i guess.. nothing else to do and if i stay up much longer and keep thinking then i really AM going to do something stupid  i think i will set my alarm so i can wake up before mum goes to work in the morning so i can talk to her about how im feeling and what i think i need to do, and we can work it out  i dunno i wanted to tell her yesterday or last week but i knew that people would be coming here yesterday/today and i definately wanted to be home for it, and not stuck in a hospital ward..   .. i dunno im just being stupid i guess, stupid in the choices im making and stupid because i cant not think about all this stuff all the time, its almost always hanging over my head its a raincloud that follows me everywhere that i cant get rid of.. or meybe i can but havent looked hard enough to find a way to yet.  yea.. back to drawing. or something. i dont know. i feel like im stuck inbetween, parents are there but theres not really a parent-child bond thing going. its just kind of an acknowledgement. they feed me and give me a place to stay and keep all my junk and say hi in the morning and ask how my day was and goodnight in the evening. but thats it. we dont eat together, mostly because they dont tell me when they eat and just sort of do, and then when i come downstairs (usually around 6ish) to see whats up, dinner's finished, their watching tv and im fending for myself. which is fine but it would be neat to eat together sometime.   this summer my aunt (lives in nevada) wants me to live with her for a month, month and a half. im anxious about it, its weird i have no bond with these people but i end up missing mum sometimes. very weird indeed. so im going to stay with her and her husband (very nice, cool people.. they are part of my biological family actually, kudos to that) and help around the house, she has lupus and he has colins desease (not cancer, not yet). i think while im out there i might see if i can learn farreing (sp?), yknow, taking care of a horse's feet and such. they have many neighbors with horses so i might see if i can help out or get a job at a ranch or something. they also have two big dogs, a mastiff and a great dane/mastiff. dunno what to think about it yet.. its 8+ hours away which isent bad but i duno.. mixed feelings..   i should go to bed, i dunno, i just hurt so bad and i dont understand, i dont get why it hurts so much, no amount of cutting right now could make it stop, and im afraid to try, i feel like bleeding but if i try im afraid im going to cut a major vein and that would be hella stupid.. and i shouldnt be cutting anyway, i dont know..   when all the distractions have left i find that im no further then where i started off at.  sigh.

      ranty thing through music not directed at anyone  Loneliness it shadows me, quicker than darkness Crawls to the surface of my skin, visibly surrounded by it  Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  Surrounded by empty souls, artificial courage used And because so, once was mine I walk this maze alone  Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  The man's beside himself, man's below himself Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself  Chaos and hate shadow me, pain it fills me up Only one thing makes me feel, missing better half of me  Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  The man's beside himself, man's below himself Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself  Chaos and hate shadow me, hate it fills me up Only one thing makes me feel, missing better half of me  Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  The man's beside himself, man's below himself Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself

       Inspiration is good for the mind   This cold sense of freeness washes over me like warm spring rains, my mind becoming lighting and farther away from reality as my thoughts race through the never-ending fields of tall grasses and wildflowers, the wind whipping my hair about my face as my feet fly faster still..   .. O'er the hills yonder thunder rumbles in the sky, the air is cold and sharp, the clouds churn, roil and writhe in agitation as rain begins to descend, fat drops landing on my face and arms, washing away the senses of the world and immersing me into the surreal dimensions.  Herein lies the state of my current frame of mind, bound and broken within my old rusted shoebox of memories, my thoughts tainted and corrupt as razors bite my flesh and blood runs through my veins, bathing my skin in its redness, a color unlike those of all the world, impossible to duplicate and yet unique within itself.. pain flows freely through my mind, faster do my feet run, yet all the while my actions are lodged in a case of mollasses, motions slow and quick, matrix becoming real, everything fading to surreal as black and blue and purple shards begin lighting up my mind.

       Decisions, decisions..    Looks like im not going to North Carolina in two weeks, after all. I can't fly by myself because I have a major seizure disorder and I'd freak, and end up in whatever medical ward they have in an airport and noone would know what the fuck to do because I'm a random person and noone's around to tell them info while I'm sitting there freaking. Grr.   I thought about what would happen if I got Valium and took it while I was on the plane but if I was with someone else it would be fine, but on my own? I'd probly end up being too drugged to know where the fuck I was.   Ah, well.. Char said she might come down and visit in the next week/s, so that's a happy. Back to drawing, programming, and contemplating my escape.  .. Wait. Tomarrow I'm heading out to Berkly, if I still feel the way I do now, then on the way "home" will be a beautiful time to up and leave.. of course.. if I ever get it all straightened out they might never trust me on bart by myself again because I have a tendancy to run off like that, but oh well.. I'll think about it more later.   .. I need to stop cutting, its becoming an addiction again, a craving, like sweet cocaine that pollutes the mind and tears at the soul..

       I know I do it, you know I do it (if you didn't you know now), if you want to yell at me you're welcome to   Joined a community for cutters, and read people's comments on how they deal with such. I'm better then I used to be. I'm not suicidal anymore, I'm not flitting in and out of the hospital several times a month, and I'm not clinging to quotes on death and dying and answering every question asked with them. I don't want to die. I really don't. Death scares the fuck out of me. It really does.  I've still got scars. And there are some new ones. I'm mad at myself but not as disgusted as I used to be. I've just kind of gotten used to it. I know that's a sad thing to be, but I have. It's not so much an "escape" anymore as it is a "habit." Its an addiction. It helps neutralize all the pain and anxiety I feel on the inside, by giving me intense pain to feel on the outside instead. And at the same time it gives me anxiety about what other people will think, and how they will react to it. Kind of funny.  My test results came back negative. That's a happy. Then I came home and watched half of the Animatrix and decided I was hella tired so I went to sleep around 6, then Fonzy called and woke me up at 11, and I've been up since. But I'm sleeping in today, I asked him not to call till well after 12 noon. Wee. Then tonight I'm going to bed early so I can get up early Sunday, and take Bart out to Berkly to spend the day with him before YRUU.  Do I tell him about my SI issue? Does he have a right to know? Probably. I think he suspects. Meybe even knows. He's seen the scars. Does he care? What's he think about the whole deal? I think the only way I'll ever really know is if I sit and talk with him about it. This Sunday looks good. Or meybe when he calls me later today. It will be interesting.  Well.. I'm off to check updates and comics, and then probably go back to bed, unless I get distracted by something else. Yeah, I've got new marks that are going to fade to scars in a week or two. My ex walked by me today and gave me a glare, but its hard to believe he's still going to care. Dunno what to think about that.

       current music: neko no ongaeshi - kaze ni naru current mood: empty   Today was a really dull day, nothing happened. I feel completely empty inside, like there's nothing there. Like the people I know are just holograms and don't really exist. Like seeing my uncle in that coffin was all fake, and he's still alive somewhere, watching all of this with that smile he used to always have. He was a layed back, easy going guy. Totally unselfish, and he loved helping others.   He also smoked. His smoking gave my late aunt (his wife) cancer, which killed her, and was the cause of his massive heart attack/heart disease, which just killed him. At the reception at my cousin's house, after the funeral, my aunt, other cousin, and a couple other people stood outside and smoked cigs all night. The only thing I could do was stare, and wonder how the fuck they can put away so many boxes. Someday they're all going to die from smoking, too, it's jus so fucking depressing and stupid that they're smoking on a day like that, cigs were basically the SOLE cause of his death. Why can't they just not smoke for one fucking day?   There was also alot of beer. I don't understand what it is with people and beer. My cousin says its an "acquired taste." Probably like green tea mochi ice cream? I guess. Well they had 4-8 cases and all were gone before the night was half over. Sigh. I can understand why but eh.. I don't know.   I started out wandering around not knowing anyone and being lonely, and then my aunt stole me away to the front of the house and talked to me for a few hours, that was uber-awesome, and kind of amusing (yet sad, I'm completly against drinking) because she was getting really fucking smashed, and was downing one beer after another, and getting all wonked out. Before she was too far gone she said she was going to design a wolf yin-yang for me, so when I turn 18 I'm going to get it tatooed on my lower back. She is totally serious, so I'm really looking forward to it. It's affordable for me, so that was neat. Near the end she said I should get my eyebrow pierced, and I just stared at her and gave her a weird look and she spazzed out and was all "I'm serious! I always wanted to but couldn't since I'm a cop - so you should!" And I was kinda.. it's a lovely thought, but I don't think so. My rents were leaving about this time and she told them her idea and my dad laughed and walked off and my mum looked completly freaked out and was all "HELL no." Sigh. I was tempted to stay the night and spend more time with my aunt (she's the coolest lady) but I had to get home. Oh well. I'll see her soon.  ... And here I am today. I should go to bed actually, I have to get up in a little less then 4 hours.   .. I still want to cut, but I've been clean for -almost- a month now.. 2 more days and it will be a month! And I promised alot of people I wouldn't so I won't.. but the temptation is still there. I've got about 6+ vials of pills I used to be on in my cabinet.. I should get rid of those. I seriously doubt I'm going to drug myself to death but who knows. The night before my uncle's funeral I got scarily depressed and lost the effort to feel anything at all. I felt like I was dying inside but I just didn't give a damn. I'm much better now.. spending all day with Kei and his friend Perry and some other people.  Well I'd better go.. so that's all I guess.

       current music: Code Lyoko - Un Monde Sans Danger current mood: okay   Well I've finally convinced my dad to pay for McAfee AntiVirus for my 'puter, I installed it and found 3 viruses (sasser.worm, korgo.worm and sdbot.worm) and about 16+ trojans. But all my ports are secure from hackers. So my computer is now running happily and appropriately. Hooray for that.  Yeah.. I think I'm gonna go play Crimsonland now.

       current music: dealership - my box current mood: afraid, brainless, fucking exhausted, in pain   I'm completely freaked out about friday ~ which is tomorrow. Uncle's funeral service. Just because I've been to 6+ funerals doesn't mean I've gotten to like them any more. The last one I went to (my late uncle's wife's actually) I simply couldn't deal and walked out (which was/is, incredibly rude, oops) and wandered around in a downpour for two hours. I don't remember if I was crying or not, it was raining so fucking hard I just couldn't tell. The road on the way home flooded, I do remember that. And I remember getting sick from getting soaked to the bone. Oops, again. But that was a long time ago.  Apparently it's gonna be 90+ degs.. so all I've got to worry about is heatstroke. And my cousin (we're staying at her house inbetween the services) has dogs, and her husband's father has dogs, which he's bringing, so I'm going to spend almost all of my time with the dogs, which I don't mind in the least.. I'm not a people person anyway. I can't bring my own dog because he's not dog-friendly, but at least we're not spending the night up there. I'll miss him, though. He's all curled up on my bed right now.  In about 8 hours I'm calling the doctor's about my hands.. skin is coming off from already-skinned places, which is creating little holes in my hands. I also can't really feel any sort of textures.. and everything feels baby-soft, which is creeping me out.  I had a creepy/scary/yet-still-somewhat-neat dream so I wrote down all the major details of it (no real story really) and drew the layout of the buildings and things. If I knew how to program video games I'd make it into a game. Like Fatal Frame 2. Except instead of having a camera for a weapon you'd have a flamethrower that died out after 2 uses. Yeah. I'll put it in story/chapter-mode sometime next week.  Kei came over today, and we spent lots of time snuggling for which I was grateful, and I tried super hard not to break down sobbing, I managed somewhat I think, to zone out instead of such things, and then my brain switched over into dream-mode and I was back in my dream, and I guess about that time I must've twitched or something, and he asked me what was wrong and his voice jerked me back to reality. If you're reading this, I can't thank you enough for doing that. Yeah.. we stopped by Angela's so she could give me CD's (I still need to burn her music.. I will when I wake up) and then got a lift from mum on the way back, because it was just so fucking cold. Then Kei left when his dad came to pick him up around 9.30-10PM.  Aaaand here I am.. I'm really freaking out, I'm fucking terrified of this friday, I want to ask mum if I can bring someone with me for moral support but she's been in a scary mood since last week. 0_o I dunno I'll see... the time arrangements are extremely complicated for someone to come with us anyway.. so who knows. I'd like to try and manage it on my own but I dunno. I don't wana slip and do something stupid.  That's all I guess. My mind isn't functioning anymore and I've stopped trying to turn it back on.

      No sleeping now.. insomnia mostly but I'm just so worried about a few people that I can't bring myself to sleep. Thinking too much.   I used to be incredibly suicidal (Yes, that's where this post is going. It's going to be morbid, and depressing. If you're in a happy state of mind - or any state of mind, and are likely to be brought down by reading such things, then don't read it. I don't want to bring you down.. however.. this IS my place to rant, so rant I shall. Just a bit of a warning first.). Sickeningly so. I don't doubt that I worried my parents sick enough that they were puking their guts up all night and not eating for days. I remember one time my friend was here, and we were in the other room, talking, and she was leaving in 30 minutes, and I pulled a handful of knives out of my pocket (I *always* had knives, razors, or other sharp things. Always.), and started testing the blades to see which was the sharpest.  She trailed off on whatever she was saying, stared at me with this horrified look and asked me what the fuck I was doing. I remember, I didn't say anything, I picked one of the knives from the rest and promptly drove half the blade into the palm of my hand. I'm not talking lightly when I said it bled alot. She.. freaked. Not the screaming-yelling-holy shit you're gonna die-freaking. She just got up and walked out. I knew she told my mum, who was downstairs at the time, and I got in major shit for that, but it was.. surreal. Didn't hurt that bad really. That wasn't the last time I did it.  I have no idea where this post is going. No fucking clue. My friend wrote about suicide in her journal, she almost tried to kill herself again, and it made me think. I'm not all that depressed really. Just withdrawn. And insanely, inhumanly worried about her. And its kinda.. I used to be so hell-bent on killing myself that it was disgusting. I tried everything. I've been to the ER and the mental hospital more times then I can count. I'm not insane. I do have, however, and insane chemical imbalance boiling in my head, but that doesn't make me insane, in itself. I have lost, at least, or almost, a full bucket of blood since I started being suicidal (around the age of 7). The few things I did not try, however, were drinking/taking drugs or poisons (just shoving them in my wounds), slitting my throat/wrists/MAJOR arteries (never said anything about minor ones) and suffocating myself. I've done almost everything else. I've eaten foods I'm deathly allergic to ON PURPOSE and had to go to the hospital and get a tube shoved down my throat for a few days.   .. I'm not suicidal anymore. 10 Years of suicidal tendencies have tought me to accept myself, and not take anything for granted. Live every second to the fullest. It has also given me a VERY low tolerance for people who bitch and complain about their problems, but never lift a finger to try and make them better.   .. I can top off several reasons why I tried to snuff my life out like a candle in the rain. Abusive (mentally, physically, and sexually) childhood, which was the main thing. Not accepted socially, for reasons unknown to me. Other personal things that I won't list here.. mainly because they're personal, and its also 3.40AM and I KNOW I'm going to regret making this post. Because I KNOW it will make people worry, and that eats at my brain until I delete such horrific makings.   .. And its also REALLY close to 4AM.. and I haven't slept alot in the past 2 weeks (save for yesterday, waking up at 1PM was nice), and I've got some health conditions serious enough that won't let me tolerate a full night of zero sleep, because they'll probably make themselves worse ~ the main ones are my lung disease, heart issues, and brain stuff. The rest are minor enough that I don't worry about them much.. unless I lose my appetite, then I start to worry alot.   Thats all, I guess. Weird rant.

      I'm so.. so afraid.   If you're reading this.. please don't leave me. If you leave and all I'll understand and I'm not trying to blackmail you into staying but please don't go.. please.. I'd be back in the hospital in a hop-skip-jump. Please don't leave.. I'm so scared.  .. All the skin is falling off my fingers. It started with just dryness/peeling, and then it got worse and worse, and now it's coming off in huge chunks, it's creepy, the palms of my hands/fingers feel numb and I can barely feel anything.. rough surface, soft fuzz, wet grass. It's a creepy feeling.. and not a happy one. People stared at me all the way back on bart this evening, because I had taken off my gloves because my hands were hot. Some little kid pointed and asked a ton of questions and his parents kept trying to shut him up. Yanno kid, if I were you, and I saw someone's hands do that, I might be doing the same thing.   My lung condition is getting pretty horrible.. there's constant fluid in my lungs ALL. THE. TIME. Everytime I wake up in the morning and sometimes during the day I'm in the bathroom spending 15 minutes coughing up (or trying) the fluid from my lungs, so I can breathe. This morning it was bloody, but I think that's from my throat, it's getting pretty raw. I think I'll be okay..   I'm just afraid. I'm so afraid I'm making myself sick, and now I'm crying. I'm afraid of everything. The traffic light, the doorknob over there, my uncle's death, and a good handful of humanity. I used to not care what people thought about me and now it's everything - I find myself watching what I do/say in hopes that someone will accept me and not pick at my person looking for all kinds of flaws possible. It's not depression.. I don't think it is anyway. The world rolls by too fast.. the days should be 36 hours, not 24. Weeks should be 8 days long, and there should be 13 months in a year. Or a different number of months every year. Or half months. Or something. I'm finding it hard to stare the world down and accept that this is how everyday of your life is.. the same number of seconds everyday. Its a big concept. This is probably sounding corny.. and I'm pretty braindead, but its something that's always chewed away at my thoughts until I finally got the brainpower to smack it back down.. for a little while anyway.  While I was at Kei's earlier today his mum came in and asked about my uncle, and I said some stuff about the funeral service, and she asked how many I'd been to. I said, six. I don't remember what was said after, or what the responding expression was. The candles of the lives around me are getting snuffed out so quickly, a fat raindrop on a flame killing the light within. What happens when you die? Does it hurt? After your heart stops.. are you dead? What are those last few seconds as your life fades like? Last thoughts? What's the last thing you see? If you could know one of two things; when you die, or how you die, which would it be?   The human conscience is a very disturbing, wonderful, scary thing. Sometimes it runs the thoughts a little farther down the line then I would've liked, though.

      I stupid. So very stupid.  Uhhmm yes.. Kei came over this morning-ish and we chilled and whatnot for most of the morning-ish/afternoon, ate foodings and then biked from my house to the Dublin/Pleasanton bart, wherein I locked my bike at the station and rode with him on bart to Fruitvale.  At the Fruitvale station place thingy I got the sudden urge to leave. I've been having these urges for years, and this was the first (okay I lied, the  second ) time I got one this strong, and thus I tried.   Note.. "tried." Uhmm Kei stayed with me on the platform thing, and we hugged/held eachother for awhile, and I half-cried, and I am really, really embarressed about that, I don't like crying in front of people, I turn BRIGHT red and it's very embarressing (unless its dark enough outside that you can't see my face very well.. like it was on Friday with Marina), but it happened anyway, so I tried hiding my face in his shirt, I don't think it worked very well.   The train to go to San Fran came, and I tried to get on it, and he pretty much held me to the bench (I don't know if it was hugging or just plain holding me there, but it worked) and then the train's doors closed and it left, and I hadn't gotten on, and I was still there, and I felt (and still do feel) really bad, because I tried to leave again, I've been doing really good for so long, I'm not cutting anymore, I'm not suicidal, and then I had to go and try and leave again *sigh*  I dunno. I thought about it on the way home on bart, and I called Marina and talked to her for a few minutes, and apparently she was at group so she got everyone to say hello to me all at once over her cell, and it was kinda funny, and then yeah, I talked to her for a bit and told her briefly what happened and then she had to go but I'll see her tuesday/wensday, which is good.   Yeaah.. bart pulled into Dub./Pleasn. and I waited around for a half hour for my dad to get there, and on the way home he yelled at me for random mish mash that shouldn't be in arguements because it's just so fucking pointless (like how fast bart travels.. wtf?) aand now I'm here drinking water and listening to Peter and the Wolf..   .. and I didn't rant as thoroughly as I thought I was going to..   .. And I dunno, I still want to leave actually, although I  will  stay here for Kei, I hope he never goes away but if he wants to, I'll understand, but I hope he doesn't. I HAVE gotten better, I'm off meds (except for a temptation to throw myself back on them.. despite how much I hate prescribed drugs.. which is scary.. I need to think that one out later.. ).. and I'm not at the institute anymore.. I'm not insane. I've just got issues. *sighs*  ... well I lied, there's the thorough rantingness you all were looking for.   That's all I guess.. I'm really fucking tired, and I'm gonna put a movie on to half pay attention to before I get anymore stupid (and scary) ideas.. like sneaking out of the house at 2AM and just walking and leaving and...   .. Okay I'm done.

      .....   Really annoyed with myself, been seizuring on and off today, I feel like kicking myself, cuz of all the health issues I have. Stress really does a number on me, I'm mad that I'm not able to deal with it better.  Sometimes I wonder why my mum had to take the stuff she took, and why my body can't be just like everyone else's. I have so much crap wrong, with my brain, my lungs are doing absolutely  horrible,  its fucking scary, I've already missed a week of school because I was in the hospital with a tube down my throat. Sigh. But that's getting better.. which is good.   Eesh.. my knees/tendons/wrists, and all that other crap I really don't wanna list, because its complicated, and it embarresses me.. just don't ask. I'm not contagious. What I'm sick with isn't gonna get passed on to anyone else, through sex or otherwise. Which is neat.   Its still really annoying.. oh well. I've been better but this definately isn't the worst I've been. If I stop eating again then I'll be utterly screwed, it's hard for me to get back into schedule if I suddenly blow off everything and ignore it all. Then my levels get all fucked up and I'm in and out of the doctor's office 3-4 times a week trying to get it all worked out. Best not do that again.   However.. despite the fact I'm ranting my little dying heart out, I still appreciate my body, and I, oddly, don't regret much of this, it IS a body, it is MY body, you only live once with the body you get, so, enjoy it to the best of your ability, and don't let anyone try to swing you otherwise. :)   [[End of rant, because my chest is fucking up again and I can't concentrate.]]

      So.. came to school this morning to find the "caution" tape stuff marking off everything and motor oil sprayed everywhere. +_+ Rather interesting way to start the day, I suppose, although kinda annoying because the major hallways are marked off so everyone has to go around. 0_o   Yeaah.. finished the 15-page screenplay for extra credit.. I did a sort of condensed version of Lord of the Rings with spoofs and references to other films and all that.. ..   .. I should probly go volunteer to get my presentation in this class over with..   .. Now all I've got left to do are the stuff from AP Art (still gotta remember to get Gov's book back to her.. WHUPS!) and study for Econ >.>  Time to go..

      Woooo we got into Harry Potter early last night! AND we got our money back, which kicked ass.  .. Not much else happening, struggling tooth and claw throuh this week and the next, we've got "dead" week this week (I always thought teacher's would lay off and give us a chance to study without exploding our brains through our ears) but instead they're really laying on the crap at the last minute, I've got AT LEAST 10 hours of work to do and no time to do it, because almost all of my free time is put into studying for my finals, and finishing projects, and balancing a few jobs on the outside +_+   Well after today there's only 4 days of school left, and 3 of them are half days, so I think I can make it.. then I'll be graduated, and looking for (yes, gasp) more jobs, so I can earn monies to pay for college. I really, really want to get into the Institute of Art in San Fran (or whatever you call it), that is a gorgeous, gorgeous school, but it costs so much T.T Though I figure, if I work my ass off for a year with 3 jobs, I should be able to maybe raise -at least- $25,000, if that. That's my current goal, anyway.   Originally I was planning to move out as soon as I can but I'm not entirely sure I can do that right now, balance 3 jobs and still support myself and my dog and cat.. -_- I will  try , but I've got doubts, even if I found a really cheap, pet-friendly appartment. Sigh.  I think I'm gonna end up giving my presentation on Monday, unless by some freak accident I do it today.. I'm ready, my site is ready to go, but I'm incredibly tired, and I'd rather do it Monday. Procrastinating is a curse..   I've still got 6 pieces due for AP Art, I'm gonna work on those this weekend (I've got 2 hours left on the first one, if I really push myself.. each takes about 6+ hours to complete and do an acceptable job on), uhmm.. 2 10-minute films and another 15 page screenplay for English, 2 rather large tests in Economics (one is one chapter, and the other one is 10+ chapters, some essays, some graphing, and some worksheets), and a 6 page survery for reasource *dies*  Though on the good side, Lucas (one of the art teachers, she taught me sculpting in her free time) is giving me red clay for this summer to work with in my free time, which I greatly appreciate.. I've got a 3-7+ lb. dragon that's about half finished; I neglected it for 3 months because I was too busy, then lugged it home to work on it there, though I'm not quite sure where my dad moved it to +_+ He damn well better not have gotten rid of it *eye twitch*  I oughta go, and update other stuff... yarg.. forgot motrin during this morning's rush.. pardon me while i go curl up and die somewhere >

      The shallowness of people never ceases to amaze me.   This past weekend I went to berkeley on Saturday to meet my friend, Kei, and we proceeded to spend the day hanging out with eachother and since I look kind of boyish (he thinks its cute) everyone mistook us for a queer couple, and we got a bazillion stares, which we thought was absolutely halarious. [[He ended up asking me out, it was very cool, and yeah.. more on that later.]]  Sunday rolls around, and my friend of 7 years asks me how my weekend went. I tell her thus, and she flips out on me and pretty much tells me "you've gotten too weird, you have to change or we can't be friends anymore." Blink? Okay.. change how? "Stop wearing black, start mingling with people and don't look like a boy." Oh.. well if I change for you what will you do for me? "How have I changed? Stop making me look like the bad guy." Ah.. okay then.   I proceeded to tell her this is how I'm going to be, yes, I look like a boi, that's fine, apparently it embarresses her to hang out with me now, and she got really mad and told me I was a fuck up in the real world and I'd never amount to anything, along with some other shit about my schooling, which I thought was rather shallow of her.   Telling me "maybe your parents never taught you how to talk to people with manners but the way you're talking to me is really rude." And.. you're not being rude yourself?   This whole shitload started with her asking me how my weekend went. She DID ask. So apparently she hates my guts now, because I "won't change for her" (well, my appearence is like my thumbprint, it's how I express myself, and you can't take that away from me), and now she's really cold and is being a total bitch. Hmm.   She tried comparing me to my friend Catherine; "she's really jumpy and always happy and wearing bright colors and you're over there looking like someone died and saying 'screw the world.' " Ah. Well, yknow, everyone's different, it's not a crime. And, for the record, I'm happy too. I may not show it but that doesn't mean I'm not happy.   Geez. Apparently there's everything wrong with changing yourself, but whatever, I've got different interests and views than she does, and she (and other people) have almost always acted cold to me, and it bothers me that she's gone "just like that" after.. 7 years of "friendship," but that's just the way the world spins, I guess. Doesn't mean I don't miss her, though.  There's the bell.. I'd better go.

       current music: The Jungle Book (movie) current mood: irritated, tired, hot, sick  &nbsp; To say the least I'm remotely irritated, its as if everyone expects me to be the "weird kid" on the block.. weird clothes, multi-colored hair, anti-social... during one of the few times I show the slightest interest in being "normal" and actually trying to hang out with friends, or looking for friends, it's suddenly everyone's business to burn me and put me back in place. What happened to freedom of expression? Since when are there "places" in society, and since when is everyone so hell-bent on shoving one person off the top of the slide so they end up falling on their ass and sitting at the bottom?  Society&nbsp;truely sickens me sometimes.

      current music: prodigy - fire current mood: absolutely fuckin' nothin'  I'm back from Nevada. Wuppee. I'm going to the doctor's to have my heart checked tomorrow, or Tuesday. It's freaking out over the little things and I'm not even 20 years old yet. I either screwed up along the line somewhere or there's something malfunctioning already.  Rents decided I've got too much time on my hands (IE, I spend far too many hours sitting here and programming stuff for people, or random shit that I end up deleting days after I have spent half a month finishing it.. yes, I'm that bored), so they've decided to let me start up another hobby.. so I chose aquarium-keeping. Suprisingly, they agreed, and are even going to help me buy a 20 gal. tank as a starter, a  very  nice filter for it, and some gravel and decors., to get me started, I guess so they won't have to hear my tacking away at the computer for hours on end.. or they could just let me get a quieter keyboard, but that isn't quite the point.  Needless to say I'm rather excited, not jumping-up-and-down-joyful, but curious, and intrigued.. this should be fun.  Yeeeeup.. that's what's been happening in my little cupboard of the world. That, and I'm going to be working for a year so I can get money to attend college next year. I'm EXTREMELY excited about that. Woo.  That's all I guess, I need to go to bed soon.
