Bye bye beautiful    Don't bother to write    Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars    Face step, let down.    Face step, step down.      ...       Last year it was "Stacy's Mom" by Fountains of Wayne. I think we've grown up a little, don't you?      Tonight was fun. After a long, boring day of rain and laundry, I went down to the Olive Garden with my family. Despite the fact that they're all embarrassingly vulgar, I had a really nice time with them for a change. My brother is so cool, he makes everything better. When we got back from dinner, the rest of the family went out to the Knights of Columbus, while I waited for Emmons to pick me up. We drove and around and listened to (guess what?) "A Favor House Atlantic" a good many times before deciding to visit Pat at work. It's worth mentioning that if it were released this year and not in 1998, "REMember" by Corky and the Juice Pigs might have edged out Coheed &amp; Cambria for this important title.      Anyway, we eventually headed to the good old Center For Shopping to play Ultimate with all the kool kollege kids. These other Ulty players were there...they weren't with any of us. They were encroaching on our territory! We decided to play with them, and we had a good time. They're from Massachusetts, I guess. After they left, we played a while longer and headed to Dunkies to hang out and talk about various concerts and Ultimate happenings, etc.      I can't believe band camp is Monday. I'm kind of sad, because that signifies the end of summer. Oh well. I got a head start on my not shaving until the end of Marching Band season, so hopefully my pathetic facial hair growing genes won't be so pathetic. I'm gonna look like a doofus by September. Oh well, it's for the love of the gam-...marching band.       Boy oh boy is time flying lately. I guess that's a good time, I haven't had much time to think about anything, and when I do think about them, it doesn't really affect me. They're just kind of stored in the back of my mind. I'm really digging this, I'm actually able to be me again and not some zombie controlled by things that are out of my control. It's a good feeling. LIBERATION IS MINE!!!!

       Today was a glorious day. I awoke at 6:00AM, ready to take on the world. I was operating on three hours sleep because I was so anxious for what was to come. Emmons picked me up at 6:30, then we got Foley. We headed to Hannaford's to meet up with Bobby, Ryan, Pat, and Kory. After some last minute food purchases, we were on our way at 7:30AM. Emmons and Pat raced all the way from Sanford to Gillette Stadium. We hit 105MPH on more than one occasion on the way down, in the middle of the morning worker's commute. We almost hit at least 5 women who were driving and applying their makeup at the same time. Throw the two-way radios into the mix, and you've got yourself a good time.       We arrived at Gillette Stadium, home of the 2-time World Champion New England Patriots, at around 9:15AM. The parking line was pretty long; around 150 cars or so. I knew that I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't take advantage of this situation. I popped my "Zuppa Toscana" mix into Emmons' CD player and went to track 11,  Tank! . For those of you that don't know,  Tank!  is the theme to the anime series  Cowboy Bebop . It also happens to be one of the best jazz tunes I have ever heard in my life. I cranked the volume as high as I could without sacrificing any sound quality. As the intense jazz beats and sharp brass notes shot through the air like a brilliant flare of sound, people began reacting. People starting laughing at our stupid dances, other people were laughing at the fact that we had the balls to play a jazz tune at such a ridiculous volume in the line to the Warped Tour, admist a sea of hard core punk rock enthusiasts.      We eventually were directed to our parking spot, which was very nice. We got in the line, and stood there for about 45 minutes until we finally were able to enter the stadium. While we were in line, all sorts of people approached us for different things. A couple asked us if we knew any bands that were good enough to be a part of next year's Warped Tour. Some people went around peddling CDs for unsigned bands or underground record labels. This one guy came up to us, and gave me a pair of headphones. What I heard blew my mind. It was just incredible. I shelled over the eight dollars for their CD without hesitation. Emmons and Kory also bought CDs. The band's name is Facing New York, and they're from San Francisco. If you've heard of them, you probably think they're damn good. If you haven't heard of them, you probably will soon enough, they're that good.      Once we got into the stadium, we were disappointed upon our discovery that the festival actually took place in the parking lot, and not on the field. We had to slowly march through the stadium like a bunch of cattle. It took us at least an hour and a half to get from the security gate, to the huge fenced off area where the festival was being held. An hour and a half packed like sardines into the corridor of a professional football stadium. It's one of the oddest feeling I've ever had in my life. By the way, for those of you who haven't been there, Gillette Stadium is a very impressive sight. It's absolutely gigantic, and it's just nice to look at for some reason, for me anyway.      Once we got into the festival, we didn't know what to do first. We ended up going to the schedule, which was useless because we forgot it soon enough. We walked around, bought t-shirts, CDs, all sorts of different stuff. Eventually we got word that Story of the Year was playing on the Teal stage, so we headed over there. We made our way into the middle of the crowd, which was a big mistake. As soon as they started, people started pushing each other. 1,700 people in a very small area pushing and shoving each other. There was nothing I could do except go in whatever direction the people around me were going. I ended up separated from everybody in the group. I was all alone in this sea of people who were angry for no apparent reason. They just started acting very, very hostile. I did my best to blaze a trail through the crowd so I could get to an open area. My ribs still hurt from what I went through to get out. I also broke my toe in the process. I'm more worried about my ribs though; a broken toe won't do much, but there really might be something wrong with my ribs. What I went through was nothing compared to what happened to Bobby, but more on that later.      When I finally made my way to an open area, I headed straight to the Playstation tent for some shade. I didn't play the games, I just needed to get cool, and it was right there. I noticed a water stand a few yards away, so I hobbled over to it, all the while pondering how I was going to find everyone. To my surprise/delight, I saw Emmons, Foley, Ryan, and Kory standing next to the water stand, all looking like I felt. After refueling on the grossly overpriced H2O, we got to looking for Pat and Bob.      I don't remember much after that. I know I ran into Jen from work, which was cool. I also ran into Pat and Lance at the Dropkick Murphys booth. I went around for a little while, buying stuff for myself and whoever I was reminded of by certain band's merchandise. Eventually it was time for Sugarcult to play, a band I wasn't particuarly looking forward to seeing, but I tagged along anyway. They had a lot of energy, and they knew how to work the crowd. I even found myself headbanging here and there. It was a pleasant surprise. After they came on, we listened to New Found Glory's set from afar. It sounded pretty horrible. We would've gone over if Yellowcard wasn't coming up on the stage that we were standing in front of. Yellowcard is one of the few pop-punk bands I like. I'm not really into that particular genre of music. Anyway, they put on a spectacular show, and I even saved a beautiful girl's life during the show! She was crowd surfing and the whole thing went awry, until I moved over and caught her. I even got a round of applause and a few pats-on-the-back from the people around me! I might have gotten a hug or something had I put her down on the ground, but instead I just tossed her back onto the crowd. Oh well.       This is a bit of a side track, but it bears mentioning. There were literally hundreds of gorgeous women there. I felt like a kid in a candy store, only all the candy had sentry guns sitting over it, and if I went to touch it, I'd get cut into pieces!      Anyway, after Yellowcard's brilliant show, we intended to stick around for Coheed &amp; Cambria, who kick exponential amounts of ass. Someone didn't feel so good, so we ended up heading out. I'm very disappointed I missed their show, but at least I got their CD, which is really good. After we left the stadium grounds, we headed to the McDonald's that was down the road for some sort of sustenance, something we were all lacking throughout the 8+ hours we were there, because we were too damn cheap to pay for a $6.50 hamburger. After we ate, Bobby took off his shoe to examine his injured toe. Turns out, it wasn't injured. It was mutilated. We decided that we were going to take him to Goodall once we got back to Sanford.      The car ride home was very enjoyable. We listened to "A Favor House Atlantic" about 15 bajillion times, and Emmons almost killed us because he was laughing so hard at "REMember" by Corky and the Juice Pigs. Once we got to the hospital, we just kind of sat back while they took care of Bob. I went in with him when they took his vitals and all that, but we had to leave because we weren't related to him. I feel horrible about it, and for all I know, he's still there! Sometimes the hospital process really makes me angry. We should've had at least been allowed to keep him company while he was there. Oh well, I'm sure he's fine. I'm going to get a hold of him as soon as I can tomorrow.      Well, that concludes the day, I guess. It was a lot of fun, and I can't wait until next year!

         I really have no reason to be updating this right now. I'm just feeling all sorts of emotions at once. I'm happy because I'm going for my license soon and the Warped Tour is Thursday. Even though I decided that I wasn't going to drink anymore this summer (because I've done about 5 summer's worth of drinking this year), I think that I need to go out with a bang. I'm just going to beat the hell out of my liver until all I can think about is the impending cirrhosis that will surely be in my near future. Or I can't think at all. That would be fantastic. Is that such an odd thing to want? The want to stop thinking? Something good is surely coming around the corner, yet, negative thoughts constantly fill my head. I wish they would stop. I wish these demons would stop haunting me. It's all because I have no self confidence. I'm in control of everything almost everything around me, but I don't have the confidence to do anything at all. I'm so afraid of rejection, I'm so afraid of being let down yet again. I tell myself that I don't need to be afraid of those things, but they always seep back into my mind. I can almost feel the negative thoughts stalking me. Then I realize the fan's on, so I turn it off, and the wind stops blowing across my neck.  I've got things to look forward to for once! The Warped Tour is tomorrow! Band Camp is Monday! School starts soon!  That really relieved me.  Goodnight. Sealab's on. Whoo!

       My dad woke me up by hitting me in the head with a box. That was nice of him. I went back to bed for another few hours and woke up at 12:17 PM, EST. I made a bologna sandwich and only ate half of it. I've been thirsty for the past two hours, but I'm too tired to go downstairs and get something to drink. I'm still in my pajamas, and I've decided that I'm not going to get dressed until I get out of the shower. I have to work at 5:00. I'm beginning to dislike Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. I have time to do something, but I'm always too sore or tired or miserable to do anything. Then I have to force myself to go to work. It's not fun.  Oh well...I think I'm going to go to sleep, and let this wash all over me.

       Bah...what a night. Work was busy, but tedious. I had a hard time concentrating, for all the usual reasons. I'm beginning to consider signing up for a frontal lobotomy. Maybe jumping from my window headfirst onto the deck would work; maybe I'd get amnesia. I just want to stop remembering, stop thinking, stop all brain activity. I just can't, though. I can be fine for hours at a time, and then out of nowhere, it hits me like a ton of bricks. I just want to sit down and be left alone, but...You don't really have that option when you're at...Say...Work.  I had no way of getting home after work, and I was surprised when Emmons called me telling me to "Get my ass across the parking lot and play some friggin' Ultimate!" I obliged, but man am I regretting it now. It was pouring the entire time we were playing. Of course, just at the worst time, my arthritis acted up. This was bad, though. As bad as it's been since my accident. I struggled through the entire game, trying to run through the excrutiating pain. After a while, Gotch gave me a ride home.  I feel sick to my stomach right now. Probably from playing Ultimate in the rain, and because there's so much that's making me nervous. Now we're going in circles, because those are the things I want to forget...well, only temporarily. I want to remember them only when I have time to stew on them, but that's life. I guess I just have to learn to throw everything aside, but it's awfully hard to just throw an elephant to the side. What am I going to do with myself?

       Well hello there!  This is my new, improved, shiny, super fantastic blog! Alright, it probably isn't any of those things, but...this is what I'm using from now on. Nothing much to talk about right now, it's just another gloomy looking Monday. I'm just killing the next 1.5 hours until I have to go to work. Oh, the joy!  Looks like I've got a case of the Mundaze...
