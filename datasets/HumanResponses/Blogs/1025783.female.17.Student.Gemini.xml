       Lily's Lullaby- Part SIX  It was cold that evening. I stole out quietly, slipping out the back gate and crouching in a bush. There, covered in a black velvet cape I waited oh so quietly for them to appear. I shivered, my breath a frostly cloud as I looked up at the sky. The moon was covered by dark black clouds, the stars hiding out of fear. Tonight was a good night for following, hardly any light. A lone owl hooted softly in the distance, it's cry traveling softly in ripples across the forest. Then I saw it. Only a pinprick of light at first, then more and more as their torches grew nearer. Where were they getting the flame? I wondered silently. They voices grew shrill and mocking, closer and closer they came. I tried to crouch lower, digging my fingernails into the old soil. I saw them approach slow motion, like out of a nightmare. I had never been this close, I could smell their rotting flesh, almost feel their greasy, torn hair. They screached and bellowed. I saw Lily, oh my dear sweet Lily look up to my window. She looked almost saddened not to see me, and for a fraction of a second I thought I saw emotion. They had become more violent recently, once in a while ripping one of their own to shreds, leaving us the dissarayed carcas the next morning. This evening they went for Lisa Ann, the prom queen. Always a beauty, I watched as four of them jumped on her, I listened to her barbaric screams, I watched eyeballs being ripped away from their sockets, hair pulled straight from the head, I heard the loud crack of her neck as it snapped in two. I felt her pain as a silent tear slid down my pale face, falling quietly onto the grass. They grew bored of this, and after a few hours they retreated into the early hours. I had watched, noticing they never looked back once, but I still kept out of sight as I followed behind. Always keeping them just within eye reach. Deep within the forest we trudged. They grew silent, and lurched quickly, almost galloping to their destination. Then we came to it and I stopped dead. It had been so obvious, so cliche so apparent and we had all just forgotten. How could we have forgotten about The Mayson Residence, deep within the forest. Old hermit Mayson we had called him, it had always been a joke within the Windsor kids that one day they were going to storm his house and throw a huge party. How ironic I thought as I stood there, wind whipping my face as I watched them reel into the old castle. It was dilapidated, the stone and wood groaning from age and wear. The perfect place to hide I thought bitterly. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts, I didn't realize I had walked into the front lawn of the vast estate. I heard a window bang and looked up sharply. Lily leaned out of a second story window, gaping smile, eyes boring into my soul. "Meredith!" She called in a deep sing- song voice, eyes glittering blankly. She leaned out of the window, her arms thrust towards me. "Come join us Merry! You always were my favorite!" I felt my knees give out, I licked my lips- dry and chapped form the cold winter wind. "No" I said quietly, a whisper at most. I fell to my knees, looking up at her. I heard them running down the stairs, so did she. Her eyes bulged, she did not expect them to find me. I was her, her prize, her possession. I looked up at her smiling. "Another time my old friend" I said sweetly, and then spit at the ground below her. Rising, I looked up into her eyes and she howled a dark, monstrous groan. I turned around and ran, arms and legs pumping from adrenaline. I stopped to see them halt at the door, for already the sun had begin to awaken. They grew angry and frusturated, their bodies lurched with anger. They threw one young man I didn't recognize onto the lawn in front of them. He screamed and tried to make it back inside, crawling slowly as his flesh melted off his bones. His carcass steamed and hissed and bubbled and oozed and diluted grey flesh fell like rivers off his dying body. Then, all at once the horrible screaming stopped. I looked in shock to the others where they hid inside the doorway, the sunlight not quite up to the doorstep. They looked at me, smiling a knowing smile. They weren't crazy, I thought, just sick. I walked quietly back to the WIndsor Mansions, engrossed in thought. Somehow I would make them pay, somehow I would watch them all die, slowly and with a great satisfaction. I would watch as Lily cowarded under my wrath, and with her last dying breath she would call for me, and I would sit just out of her reach, smiling and singing her lullaby- just for her.

      I sat there Playing alone on the attic floor dust rolled by and I smiled The rain beat against the windows But the wind protected my pigtails and curls And you forgot So I sat there And found your secrets Hidden in the dust I sat there, angelic and so naive As the storm howled a warning I shouldnt have opened those boxes But I was so little Why did you box up such horrible manifestations I let them out, untied the string Down it fell, warmed over by dirt and old stories I was so little, much too young to learn of such pain But you forgot So I sat there Pigtails bouncing, eyes wide open I sat there

      Firelight fled up and down their wild faces And welled up in their eyes in orange tatters Soot polished their hands Their tanned muscles torn and ripped As they danced around the fire Their bodies cast dancing glows Embers fluttered like fire butterflies Slowly crushed into ash piles The fire roared and bellowed Licked and leaped Wild and crazy as the men around it

      Three little girls All cross legged in a circle They shook their heads and laughed and smiled Pigtails bouncing, eyelids fluttering Then the man came They turned, slow motion Fright crawled up their necks Blew in their ears Whispered in their bright blue eyes Dressed in black He walked silently over to them, and hovered They stopped giggling The pony tails silenced and hushed He smiled, grandly and flourished his cane "Tonight!" his voice boomed "Tonight is the night you shall LIVE!" he sang The little girls looked at one another  One stifled a giggle One tugged at a curl The other wiped dust of a Mary Jane His laughter cut out They looked up questionly Only to see a different man An angry man in his place Same clothes, same skin But different "Hello I'm Mary!" said the second little girl Looking up politely with eyes of cornflower "Hello Mary, I'm the Devil" said the bright, burning coals

      There's a place I call home Not many of you have been there Not many of you would understand I have sisters there In this home of mine Sisters that are deeper than blood That swim in the lakes My sisters and I We fly through the mountains And sit under the shade Of all the tall, tall pine trees This place I call home I can walk through the dust And sing songs and give hugs whenever I want Fires burn bright in my home Crackling and sputtering  In my home Animals call out in the midnight The stars sing back Glittering diamonds beckoning I sit here in society And miss the smells the sounds and the taste I miss my sisters But next summer When the sun is bright We will fly and run and sing once again In my home That they too can understand

       Lily's Lullaby- Part FIVE  I became obsessed with my new vampire friends. I never saw the other people in the household, and after a while they gave up on me and just let me do as I pleased. My own mother eventually ignored me, but I didn't care. It was sad how cold we had grown towards one another, but we all knew that we would rather our neighbor die then ourself. Then one night I knew what I had to do. I had to find where they hid during the day. Always from the east they came, but we had been over that area many times, it just opened up into miles and miles of forest. We had all stood on the brink of that hill during the sunny afternoon, shaking our heads in disgust because we all knew it was impossible to find them in that mess. But somehow, somehow it must be possible. I knew I would have to find a way to detect their hiding place, or we would all be driven mad by their nightly singing and taunting. So one night, I did the unspeakable. I followed them.

       Lily's Lullaby- Part FOUR  A month now. Dull repition had sludged into the Windsor Mansions. We spent our days filling up with supplies, maintaining our fort. By nights we ate quietly, listened to music or read in the library. I spent many of my nights hidden deep within the library. Fortresses of books hid me, but my real reason there was to learn. I gather books about science and medicing until one day I found it. It had been written a long time ago, by a man most likely put in a penitentiary for such radical ideals. His first page caught my eye.   Vampirism is a rare but real disease. Another name for it is pofiria. It causes changes in the blood formula: shortage of erythrocytes and iron. For a "normal" life the ill people really need blood, but not necessarily human. Receptiveness to the sunlight grows, which can cause burns even after a short period, so the vampires lead a night life, their faces whiten, bodies get skinny and so they look like classical bloodsuckers from books.   Physicians do not agree on the causes and development process of the disease. It is often said that it is being formed at genetics level, but alcohol abuse, hepatizes, some medical drugs overdose can also cause the disease.    I knew immediately that my childhood fear had manifested. Little darlings all over the world gave a silent scream as they shared in my pain. I knew, that somehow I had to stop the Windsor beauties from spreading, I knew that the vampires must be killed effectively and quickly.

       Lily's Lullaby- Part THREE  It was only two weeks after that first deadly night that we were fully prepared for their attacks. That first night was pure fear dripped drop by drop into a great basin stored by Satan. They had broken through the windows, running into the house- their bodies mangled and bloody from ragged glass. My father's body we found the next morning, or rather, what was left of it. They had clawed through his stomach, ripping out organs and using the blood to write profanities on the house walls in typical teenage angst. In the house they had reeled, our only reason for survival was of pure speed. All I remember is running, legs pumping heart stabbing and looking behind me. There were three of them immediately trailing me, bodies reeling and eyes glazed- maniac laughter boomed through the house. We lost some of the older servants, but my heart had grown cold and I only thought to Darwin that night. We hid in the basement, doors barred with steel as we listened to their moaning and unearthly laughter beat at the doors. We lay there, water dripping in little rivlets, dark shadows choking us, as they pounded against the great oaken doors. Their need for fresh blood drove them crazy, we could see through their glittering eyes. The sun eventually rose into another cold, frostbitten morning- and then they were gone. We emerged from our black tomb cold, wet and shaken. But we were stronger. From that day forth we experimented and through trial and tribulation found what they feared and what they dispised. My father's death was a model for what could happen to all of us, a vision that made us work all the longer. During the day we would run to the nearby stores just down the hill, ignoring decaying bodies and push our way into the delapidated grocery and hardware stores. Here we stocked up on the essentials- nails, canned goods, wood, tools. These are what kept us alive. We built up our fortress, knowing no other way to live. It was grim, but human instinct kept us from giving up. They showed up every night, always coming from over the hill facing east- brandishing torches that made their faces glow and jump with flame. Their routine never differed. ALways the same horrific, mechanical spinning and jerking that they called dancing. Always Lily looking up towards my third story window where I hid and watched, always her smiling that monstrous smile and singing to me. Her voice always seemed to reach me, shrill and so alarming, yet soothing. It made me dizzy, and sometimes I found myself yearning to be with her. The days grew shorter and shorter, and the nights stretched themselves into great black ribbons of hell. I found myself being driven slowly crazy as I watched them arrive by nightfall, so thirsty and so willing.

       Lily's Lullaby- Part TWO  I fell back from the window sobbing and shaking. I heard their laughter grow louder and it filled my ears like an unrelenting wave. We sat there in that cold, cold room just listening for a while, as it began to drive us all quietly mad. I looked over to see my father rocking back and forth on the rug. His eyes were glazed and he kept humming soft lullabies. "Pappa?" I called timidly? He looked at me, eyes darting and crazy. "Don't look at the window" He said calmly, and brandished an old wooden bat and walked out of the room. A thin whisper shook through me, knowing that I shouldn't look, but my mind got the better of me. My head turned slowly, eyes wide in anticipation. We had placed wood in front of the window, and as I turned I noticed it was stripped clean.  Lily stood rigid and placid, grinning from ear to ear just staring at us all. A shrill scream filled the room and I realized it was coming from my own throat. Lily's face changed, she grew angry and berserk. Clawing at her hair and eyes, her long sharp nails grew streams of blood from her molding cheeks. She pounded at the windows, and just as they seemed they were going to break she fell. It was too dark to see what had happened, but I heard the bat crack in half just as Lily's insane laughter mixed with the dying cries of my father.   *To be Continued*

       Lily's Lullaby- Part ONE  They come at night mainly. Throbbing crowds of them, gaunt and pale. Jeering, singing and always dancing. The dancing was the worst, running through your head like a broke- down movie. Their thin bodies jerked around like puppets on strings. We hid in the Windsor Mansions because they were afraid of them. Of course they were, those mansions had been their homes. They were the Windsor Children, once beautiful, once wealthy. All of the children were dubutants, scholars, athletes and prom kings and queens. Loved and despised, these angels had everything handed to them on a silver platter. And then the plague.  It started as a whisper, a mere rumor. Then one night it was breathing down your neck. It swept through the town of Windsor, killing the old and young, the sick and deranged. It left only the youngest and fittest, mutating them into something from hell. My family worked in a mansion, and we saw the disease coming so we hid. We hid in the deepest bowels of the house that only we the workers knew of. We hid as their once bronzed, toned bodies turned ash grey and limp. Their golden and raven curls fell out in thin patches. They ran around their castles  clawing their eyes out and frothing at the mouth. They ran around in splendor, knocking priceless vases and tearing countless paintings. Out into the roads they tore, horrible and gruesome monsters as a madness began to settle into them. And there we watched, the maids, butlers and gardeners who had know the inner workings of the houses and hid from the contamination that was induced from blood trading. I watched through cracks in the walls as the people I had waited on died of turned mad. It was a cruel sense of pleasure to watch them writhe, a grim satisfaction in being in charge and safe as the wealthy lost their once beautiful bodies and minds. After they left, we crept out from our hiding places, half- starved and scared mindless. The first morning we barricaded doors and windows, turning frantic as nightfall approached, for we all dreaded night. They always came out in the night, going God knows where when daylight broke. The first night was horrible. We sat there in a great dining room that had belonged to the McMasters. John, Debora and daughter Judy had dined there in splendor. That afternoon I had helped to burn the corpses ofJohn and Debora. Judy had been driven crazy, joining the others as the undead. We sat there, a group of ten maybe, huddled together bracing knives and bats. The sun melted, the room darkened and so did our spirits. My brother William sat up stiffly and flicked on a light.  The room filled with light and we could see clearly. That's when the singing began. We were a quiet, grim group until we heard singing off in the distance. We cast quick glances at one another, trying to ignore the horrible noise. Shrill, squealing voices like an out of turn piano. The voices came close to the house, louder and louder the shrillness became. I snuck a peak through the boarded up windows. Splashes of light crept through the boarded glass and allowed me to faintly see the outside landscape. There they were, dancing in circles in front of the house. Their bodies were sickly and thin, pale grays and whites. Their eyes glittered black, their entire pupil a deep tar color. They flaunted their decrepid bodies to one another, laughing at the moon and each other. Their laughter was horrible, deep and trembling, as if it had sprung from the devil itself. I spotted a girl I had waited upon, Lily. OUr eyes met at the same time and her mouth opened wide to reveal a mouth filled with fangs. Her lips curled back in a menacing smile and she began to slowly sing the lullaby I had once sung to her. "Lily my love, now you must sleep" Her body swayed slowly as she sang and her eyes glittered with cruel satisfaction. "Come out and play Meredith!" she called to me, thin arms beckoning.   *To be continued*

      I lived a good long part of my life feeling uninspired. Sitting there bland on the brink of imagination, tendrils of creativity just out of reach Something snapped then, I remember it one rainy afternoon The rain poured down, creating little rivers on the window I looked out of and then I found myself Thank you

       Summer Storm  Wind howls, shaking the farm like a monkey rattles a cage. It shrieks, and the old home moans in reply. The dust picks up, whipping around like a pair of jack rabbits. Dirt bites at the man like an angry dog. His eyelids shut and he licks the air- already damp and dark. The rocking chair on the front porch creaks with anticipation Dirt- creased eyelids snap open and survey  "Summer storm" he sighs The corn nods and sways in time.

      Our society wants so much to exist Reality is such a baled myth. We beat our heads to strive for conformity We sit in rows, and stand in lines because those are the rules. Take your rules my friend, throw them away and run away laughing Sprint off into the sunshine, skin bared, hair streaming and soul freed... Run away and never come back to my world of rows and lines and frowns.

      I'm tall and strong and proud of me. They sit and stare, choked giggles behind whispered hands. Dance along, sing under trees and under rain Are you so afraid of the climax, the thriller and the way of life> Don't be afraid of me. I'm tall and skinny and pale and dirty blonde and i have worries and problems and factors. Yes, I am a teenager and if you do pause on your heels to listen to my message, you probably won't take me seriously But I'm ok with that Because I know I make a difference I am tall, and strong and so proud of all I am.

      He used to call once and a while, just to listen to my exasperated voice and hang up. Of course it was him, I'm not stupid. His eyes never quite met mine after that, his arm never again accidently brushed mine. Crazy of course that I ever did care. I must still though, just enough to write this. I'm really sorry, but honestly- it's just me. Please don't be so sad.

      Broken Glass means nothing to me Shard by shard, tear by tear they drop Ranting, yelling, bleeding never made you notice Darkened room, I sit in a puddle of glass Candles flicker, but I can't feel their heat I left a rose for you But the shards cut it The rose bled and bled Crimson petals, tears of blood It's not your fault, but mine I should have never met you, it made me a rose- you are my glass Careful, don't come close or you'll hurt me again Pain, pain pain- feel it wash over me Your smile makes me want to scream now Your laugh makes me want to cry Go ahead, play the guitar, pause and cock your head towards the stars Breathe in the scent of roses, and perhaps I'll corss your min. You'll remember that night with a laugh, that night some silly school girl confessed her affection for you  what was her name again?

       Sweat and Sun  The record player drifted lazily, the heat radiated, created waves over the asphalt Music wafted over sweaty bodies, lolling dogs too lazy to bark, and floated up to the sun The heat hitting the music like a sledge. Windows open all the way People on thei doorsteps, licking shade from dark corners Swear poured into the sewers The men took their shirts off in protest, as the women eyed them jealously Long hair sticking to their back Someone began singing along in a slow, drunken voice "My baby, she's just fine" The sun rose with the temperature Heat washed over them all.

      One woman middle of the stage The club is pitch black, on lone spotlight glares down of her. She sits, poised on a black metal chair He black hair swept back into a tight bun Heavy white powder covers her face and neck, thick black eyelashes lay closed. Her mouth lay in a cranberry pout. Her dancer body lay wrapped around the metal, cold mixed with heat. A piano plays a key, the eyelashes open. "Showtime" The cranberries whisper

      His eyes, I tried, I really swear I tried to look past them. Look at his mouth, the hate, the lyrics, his hair so wild and mad.  But his eyes held me close, strangling me with all the anger they held. Im sorry, I whispered, as I ran away from those eyes.

       Inhale  The boy and girl are so in love Waves wash across as they both watch the sun melt. Water kisses her freckles, sand hugs his hair She glances over, just as the sun turnes a ruby red His eyes glimmer with sun and love. She nods, and agrees- it is beautiful. She takes her small white hand, and squeezes it. Laying her head on his shoulder, she breathes in. Dont forget to fall in love, she will later tell their children, don't forget.

      "She was so beautiful, a saint" They all nod and pretend to weep Women pretend to hunt for kerchiefs while checking the time. What to say about Lisa Ann... the preist pauses and looks down in the casket before him There lay a woman, who  was a beauty MOre than a beauty, just amazing But her spite and anger kept them away. He sighs, shakes her head "She was so beautiful, a saint."

      Merryweather Inglebrook with her golden pigtails and pink cotton dress Humming so cheerfully in a place full of grief. Don't you know where you are?? A woman grips her shoulders, knuckles white Merryweather nods, pigtails bouncing, eyes wide with suprise Momma's here!  She declares brightly, Layin' right next to Poppa! She turns around and runs behind an ancient oak, her giggles eerie and floating on the wind. The woman sighs, shaking her head. She turns around, her foot hitting a tiny plot. How sad she murmurs, A Young Child dead between her two parents She stoops over to read the gravemarker, the writing old with age:  Merryweather Inglebrook 1892-1899 Beloved daughter, lost with her parents  The woman taps her foot and sighs Such a shame Such a shame

       Shroud  The girl is bleak and cold Screaming got her no where, cutting made it worse God looks down, taps his foot tsk tsk tsk Why can't you be happy?? She shakes her head and curls up in a ball One by one she drops them in her glass of clear Plink, plink and fizz... times 120 Slowly, methodically, until the bottle is empty Her eyes are big and round in the water's reflection Plink, plink, fizz, fizz She sings to herself She wipes off her mouth, and goes to sleep IT will all be over in the morning, she sings She closes her eyes and smiles.

      I am you, and you are me We fly and sing and cry together. Your eyes, your lips, your nose all me, all mine I breathe and you inhale- you pain and I cry You will die, and my heart will break But my soul will rise and we shall fly and sing and cry together For I am you, and you are me Together- we are one.

      You giggle as though you know me, as if I'm here...but I'm away across cool clouds, and warm pillars, atop a golden castle soaring in the heavens- I glide with wings of silver and step upon leaves of copper and jade. My castle is away from humanity, away from you.  You giggle as if you know me, as if I'm here.

      Dream of the world. I watch your eyes drip with the dew of the Andes, your forehead sweat from Bora Bora, your body is scented with African dirt. Your mouth opens and you sing, arms flailing like birds, legs like a gazelles- you're so full of culture, so full of magic. Your song is too great for words, too beautiful to be tied down to one language. A thousand voices, a thousand tales, a thousand lives. All from your body- you leap and swing and bound and twirl- singing all the while. I sit perched on a rock, enraptured. SO this is why I love you.

      Why are we Afraid? Whats in the essence of fear that can silence a room, kill a man- stop the world? Why are some hysterical, and some irrelevant? Fear is not it, but rather manifestated by a little child late at night, slapped into the woman being raped, slammed into the man watching his child die. But fear is delicious. We plunder these feelings off one another to feel good about ourselves. Fear evokes emotion, emotion evokes passion. So why are we so afraid?

      Sometimes I get inspired Doesn't everyone now and then? It's nothing special to you, but to me it's the worl I judge people too quickly, I say things too fast Sometimes I'll just sit and watch, and do you know what I learned? No one feels, everyone just talks Achieve happiness, I once read Stretch like a cat on a Sunday Morning, laugh like a baby in it's mother's arms Love like it's the movies, the book said ...I'm workin on it

      She sat placidly on the old wood swing Swaying ever so slightly as the wind rustled through the weeping willow How fitting she thought, with a bemused smirk on her face That I sit here mourning under such a recognizable tree Her hair lay in soft curls, dampened by the morning rain She swayed in time with the swing, her toe gently touching the edge of the pond as she went forward It sent soft ripples out toward the center of the pool And She smiled softly to see it upset a waterbug Her tears dropped gently into the grass below Soft, glistening little diamonds buried warm in the soil Her head lay bent, her body defeated Her mouth opened slightly pale, cracked lips parted and uttered a whispered cry No sound came from that little girl The winds moved North, uncaring, unaware

      There was a time when you would drive me crazy I would sit there and rant and cry alone and be afraid you would leave I don’t want to waste time or energy on you anymore Yet you have me in a bind For you see, my life is tied to yours Too many strings to break now We’re stuck together, you and I And there’s nothing I can do Because I still need you

      She fell that night Down and down, faster and faster I sat there, as the sun fell And I heard her scream and cry I looked across the fields and meadows and hills And saw the people throw their arms up  I saw them flinch as the heat killed them all And I saw the Sun’s face as she killed all her children Her look of sorrow and remorse I sat there watching it all with grim contempt I am the moon; those were my children as well

      Their bodies grew sick and tired Pale and thin It was an age of famine, despair and plague They looked out of their windows From their quiet, dirty bed And saw still Everything was so quiet, so tired They were feeble Long ago had the tanned muscled laughter been silenced Long ago had they drunk wine and feasted on meat Today it was cloudy and cold Today they slept, and did not wake up

      The sky gave one last groan as it was sliced open by hell The heavens tore open; clouds were dissected and thrown aside The ground was heaved and tossed like waves The people mere specks of nothing Everywhere death, for life was found and promptly disposed of The devil sat there, legs up and crossed He smiled Welcome to My world

      Depression is nothing more than curiosity being quenched Life is full of questions, and as a child we yearn to have them answered As we grow however, we are burdened with these answers The world was once a candy- coated fairyland Glistening in the eyes of a child, laughter was essential Now the gray suited civilian is master Drab, superficiality seeps into our pores Our answers have been answered But did you really want to know Truth hurts enough to kill

      She walked down the road One giant black river Waiting to swallow her up and forget about her One foot after another she placed herself Her head wrapped up in a big black scarf Tears dripped alongside raindrops She wanted to be swallowed by that river and forgotten She pulled her coat closer to her thin body Shivered not from cold, but from loss The scarf fell to the ground It was lost in the raging river Her feet stopped placing themselves And she drowned in that black torrent It forgot who she was, why she came And she didn’t care Not one bit

      One sole man  The heat on the highway rose like tributaries Steam hissed as he spit on the yellow line One black, hot ribbon of road is what he walked on Going God knows where His suit was faded blue, creased with dust and work His shoes plodded slowly on the cracked asphalt Cracked with age and wear His hair had been neatly combed once, but lay in uneven tufts He stopped for a moment, standing bare in the middle of the road His wrinkled hand reached inside a dirty pocket and unearthed an ancient handkerchief He wiped his sweat -lined brow and surveyed the flat land with a careful eye. Sun beat down on the man and his road Silence beat down on the traveler and the traveled.

       Star Flight  He watched as the universe soared above, then closer and then past Stars rushed by and planets danced Sparkling diamonds fell within his reach His breath fogged the window of the ship And he quickly wiped it away To drink in more of the amazing heavens So whatcha do boy? The cop asked roughly I killed a man, said the watcher simply The cop shiftly uncomfortable and sidled away from the man Why would you do a thing like that? Asked the cop, raising his eyebrows and exchanging looks with another police man The inmate looked silently out of the rocket that was to bring him to a barren deserted planet for convicted felons He looked into the heavens, into the beautiful belt of planets and stars He stared wide and long, and at last broke into a big smile Where else could I see heave in all it's glory He said with a wide sweep of his hand towards the window The cop guffawed loudly So you're willing to give up your whole life for a three minute glance at some stars? The inmate looked silently at him Then looked back out at the winking stars This He said quietly This is my whole life

      I can sit for a while In a shady park Legs, crossed Hat on Slow breeze And I can watch as people walk by and children play and sprinklers catch light I can sit there So quietly and content The heat keeping me silent And I can watch But what do I see I see problems and worries and issues when I watch the adults I see selfishness and violence and ostracizing when I watch the children So I sit there quietly And just watch the grass and the sprinklers and the birds Saddened to think that we live in such beauty That we never notice

      It was raining Rivers and streams flew and leaped down the roads  Licked the windows and kissed the rooftops It had been raining on Earth for forty years The sun had not shone Leaving everything a dull, gray washed out color Little Becca Simpson sat in her classroom Hugging her legs against her chest, head against the cold windowpane Just staring out into the dark, cold morning But today, today would be different Just twenty more minutes Everyone was talking about it Today was the day the sun would shine, for just one hour Once every forty years, came the hushed whisper And today it would shine Becca would sit in the sun And hug the rays and bathe in the heat To be warm, to be really warm was all she wanted SOmeone shoved Becca A deep, hard shot Get out of my seat, Growled a voice behind her Becca ignored him, just an annoying little boy He roared in anger and grabbed her by her sweater Becca's arm shot out and hit the boy, but more came and hit her back They shoved little Becca Simpson in the janitor's closet Kicking and screaming she cried and pounded against the door Two hours later they remembered her and gasped It was meant to be a joke, just let her out right before the sun would come out But they had run outside and forgotten all about little Becca SImpson They had laughed and played in the sun Caught the brightness in their hands and watched it glow And when it had begun to rain again they ran inside the classroom, laughing and shaking sunshine from their hair,  only then remembering their little captive The little boys were wide eyed with fear as they walked slowly to the closet Brett Thompson, the boy who had shoved her unlocked the door and opened it slowly They was Becca, hung from the coat rack of the closet Little Becca Simpson driven crazy From the darkness and fear Little Becca Simpson who had hung herself Because she was sick of being cold.

       Delilah  Kaela flopped down against a tree trunk, sighing with contempt. Getting kicked out of school again was the least of her worries, it was more a problem of her dreams. They had started less than a month ago, always getting more and more realistic. Always the same girl, beautiful and regal with eyes brimming with sorrow. Always the crying and pleas for help. Kaela twisted her long blue ponytail around her finger, tighter and tigher until her finger turned red. Lost in thought she groaned as she heard the bell ring in the distance. Kaela scooped up her bag and sprinted home, narrowly missing students heading home after a long day of school. She used her key to get in, and was nearly knocked over by her oversized labrador. "Hey, you damn mutt" she said affectionately, patting his head and scratching him under his chin. She strode into the kitchen, dropping her bag on a chair and peering at a note tacked on the food projector. Her mother was in Reno again, with that new boyfriend of hers, Sam or Cam or something. Kaela sighed and walked quietly into the living room, switching on the monitor and flopping onto the couch. Cartoons displayed around her head, playing hologrpahic images beating each other senseless. Kaela closed her eyes, lulled by the afternoon heat.  She was back, in that world with her. Kaela opened her eyes and stretched her limbs yawning and looking around. "Please" said a voice quietly. "Please, you must help us Kaela," She strode out from the shadow of a tall building, beautiful and elegant. Kaela turned to look at her, and found she could talk. "Where am I?" She asked slowly, still sleepy and confused. "I've brought you here," The girl said quietly, "I don't know how long you will stay this time, but you're here and you must help." Kaela eyed the girl and her surroundings. She seemed out of place, for her setting was a dreary alleyway, complete with fog and crowded, dirty homes. "What do you want from me?" asked Kaela suspiciously. "It's your time," The girl said as she strode forward. Her hand slid into Kaelas, and the world began to melt, "It's time for you to meet your destiny."

       Silver Sun  It started a long time ago. She knew of it every since she was a young child, barely able to stand. Their ships had flown down, gleaming underbellies glaring in the hot sun. Naive young civilians crept out of their houses and cramped apartments, curious as wide- eyed children. They played music and marched gaily in the streets. Visitors! They cried with jubilancy. From another planet! Another cry rang out. Warm, stiff July breezes rose swirling dirt around the landed rockets. Too many to count, like silver sardines lined up in a row. Alice was there, just like all the others, pigtails curled up with red and blue ribbons, eyes glowing and streamers in hand. That had been many years ago, the streamers and ribbons and music all swept away by the July wind. They doors had opened up. Great steel fortresses pried their mouths open, leaving gaping black holes. The music and giggles died down as steamed hissed from deep within the shining metal rockets. They stepped back, slowly at first and then a stumbled run, panic flew through Alice as they emerged. Gaunt, tall skeletons, lean and musclular. A dullish rubber sheen to their skin was dulled in comparison of their rockets. Their eyes were insect like, and clicked and hummed. They twitched their heads, rotating them and moving their joints like newly oiled machines. Their limbs were long and thin, but strong like wire pulled taut. They wore no clothes, baring smooth strong skin. They raised their hands to the people, fingers outstretched and long. The humming and clicking grew louder, and more metallic. Her mother gripped her hand tightly and whirled to run away. A stinging metal shot fired through the air, hitting Alice's mother square in the back. Alice felt the impact and was pulled down with her mother. She screamed as her hand was pulled from her mothers. More metal zings followed, and Alice watched in horror as neighbors and teachers and former gardeners fell to the ground, gasping for life. She ran, ducking and dodging the falling bodies, blocking out the screams and chaos. Her streamer was torn from her hand, trampled by boots and heels. She tripped and fell, knocked to the ground by a falling body. There she lay trapped, for many hours until at last, all was silent. Alice lay crying, and for a child of five she lay very still and was very good. She knew that her mommy would be proud of her, and would maybe even take her down to the soda fountain that next afternoon. So she lay there, very quietly and very good. The stars crept out, shining merrily and twinkling down on the little town, that lay so quiet and still.

      He crept silently through the kitchen, down on all fours to avoid being seen. He was silent and dark, hidden in shadow. Quietly he crept across the floor, pausing only momentarily once in a while to cock his head and listen to the quiet hum of the stove. The back door was locked, and he grunted in frusturation. He squeezed himself through the dog door and tumbled head first into the wet lawn. Shaking his head, he smiled and walked slowly over to the pool. He dipped a foot in cautiously, teetering from the change of balance. The water was cold, and dark and the ripples lapped softly away from him, into the darkness. He fell into that black pool, plunging deeper and deeper. The moon got smaller and smaller and he smiled as he silently closed his eyes. Deep inside the house, the babysitter looked up suddenly from her magazine. "Johnny?" She called with bored concern. "Johnny, I can't hear you playing mister!"

       Carnivalé   The roads of his small, peacefull town whispered quietly that fatefull evening Shadows danced in the flickering candlelight in the frosty windowsills The cobblestoned streets were dusted with dry, crackling leaves jittering across that one, lone night He couldn't sleep, so he crept to the window The shade pulled back just slightly, revealing a slice of crescent moon The moon shone down upon the street below, it's faint glow lighting the old, weathered stones Silently, he watched as they approached Dark, massive structures and cages being pulled on bumpy old wheels Men and women, silent and unrecognizable teetered and danced and trudged along They made no sounds, save for the squeaky patter of the old, painted wheels A lone man walked in front Broad, tall, strong and powerful His face a mess of shadows The little boy watched silently above as they trudged through the town The man stopped at the center of town, the procession behind him coming to an abrupt halt. The shadows swirled and danced His hand rose up to twirl at a black moustache His eyes flickered in the candlelight A hiss sounded from one of the covered cages A low growl sounded from another A woman began to sing softly From within a covered cage The hissing and growling ceased The man smiled, revealing a showstopping smile "Carnivalé "  He whispered, his accent deep and thick The candles flickered out The Carnivalé  had come to town.

       Dreamcatcher  She was falling Faster and faster Past blurred faces and claws and fire and screams Yet she sat there so calmly Not the least bit alarmed Somehow she knew Knew it was a dream Just a light figment, just something she would get out of Of course she was right And as she awoke from her slumber She smiled a cocky, I'm too rational for you kind of smile She rose from bed and stretched Yawned and put feet with floor The Devil stepped out of the shadows of her room A dream, he said with a quiet whisper You may realize this is a dream, his whisper getting louder But what you do not realize, his voice now booming off the walls Is that time is forever in my dreams, His laughter piercing her ears Slicing that coy smile clean off her face

       Home  He sat that cold winter evening Back against a cold hard lamp post It's glow faint and seemingly far away His eyes looked out beyond an ancient furrow brow, seeing only cold swirling snow He sighed, a deep push of air that sent a white cloud spiriting away from him Larissa darlin, He said in a deep grieving voice Larissa, why'd you leave me here precious? A tear slid slowly down the face of a fresh mourner Mate gone, hopes and dreams with her The man, bent with age and sorrow curled into a ball Arms wrapped tight around his scuffed up pants A thin, wisp of a wind ruffled his hair Those ancient eyes looked up Back on Earth, an old woman, was alone in her home Mrs. Larissa Thompson sat in that lonely old house, grieving for her recently dead husband. Wesley She whispered timidly Pale thin hands wrapped up in one another Why'd you leave me here all alone? She shook and tears welled up in her eyes She swallowed, and the hands unwrapped themselves Reached under the bed, to where Wesley has kept the gun I'll be home soon Wesley She said in her quiet, but firm manner.

       Pale Assassin  His pale hands shook with cold and fear Trembling veins froze into tiny blue rivers His eyes shot through the heavy mist Making out a dark shadow of a man Coming towards him, knife in hand The old man stifled a scream and fell back into a black shadowed alley Falling onto cold wet pavement He looked up into the eyes of  his assassin Deliverance his pale lips trembled Deliverance is for cowards growled the murderer A silent scream filled the deep harbor docks that fateful evening As blood mixed with salt water The gas lamps flickered and purred with content.

       Wonderland  The sky twinkled overhead Sparkling little diamonds He plucked one gently from the heavens Smiled, and then smashed in to a pulverized mound. He looked upon the peaceful earth Sang to the people and the trees Then stomped and thrashed until all was still He then went back into his home and sat down quietly Opening his book he began to read Once upon a time there was a horrible ogre What a strange story he chuckled to himself....and popped a few children in the oven on broil.

       Special  Two tiny girls sat cross-legged Facing one another in the middle of the school yard Rolling marbles Plink, plink, pow! One of the girls shouted and wiggled with joy The other sat sullen and brooding The marbles rolled Towards the angry girl Shaking little piles of glass The wiggler stopped and looked in shock How did you do that?  The wiggler asked quietly The girl gathered up the marbles and stood up silently Her shadow blocking all sunlight from the wiggling little girl I'm just special She said in a whisper And walked across the playground

       All That We Live For  I was in the car One late winter night Highway lights Colors like shiny presents Blurred together in bright ribbons Mist fell deeply like snowflakes When I saw him there A young man, like all the others Homeless, just sitting on a bench Arms wrapped tight around himself Rags as clothes I sat in my car Heater blasting Radio on christmas songs I glanced over, as the bright lights caught my attention He and I looked at each other But unlike all the others  I didn't forget him Because he smiled And he meant it I smiled back, and we knew one another We were in the same place Just watching all the cars run past On their way to homes and loved ones I don't know why he mattered so much to me But that night I cried And my tears were for that man That had his arm wrapped around himself because he was so cold THis isnt a poem, a writing or even me trying to be creative It's me coming to the realization that we do live in Fairy Land And I guess this is just me being thankful SO thank you to my parents, my society and my friends And most of all thank you to that man WHo smiled at me like I was a real person

       Lily's Lullaby- Part SEVEN  The next few days I spent engrossed in thought. I knew I had to get rid of them, but how? I sat pent up in my room- only telling the others slight information. They dismissed me as crazy and generally left me alone. Then one night it hit me. I watched as their torches came slowly over the horizon and I knew what I had to do. The Mayson residence was their safehouse, their haven. To get rid of their haven would be to get rid of them. It was dilapidated, dying already. It wouldn't be hard to burn the hell hole to the ground. I spent that evening looking down upon the monsters, smiling and waving sweetly at Lily who howled and leapt and clawed at the ground and walls. I spent that night anxiously waiting until they left, trudging back to the forest. I slipped out of the house, provisions in my cloak pockets, kicking aside their now dead amusement from hours before. My foot got caught in the man's jacket and I pulled sharply. Something caught my foot and I fell to the ground hard, hitting my head on a sharp stone. I became groggy and everything blurred. The last thing I remember seeing was the dead man's face, leering at me, putrid stale breath choking me slowly. It must of been much later that I woke up. My head throbbed and I could feel the dried cracked blood on the back of my neck. Why was I still alive? I thought desperately. And where was I? I tried to rise, and felt a reeling in my head, and a dull pain through my body. I sat into a fetal position and had a look at my surroundings. I was in some kind of a barn it looked. The room was small and dark, furnished with nothing but a cold stone floor, some dry pieces of hay and a shivering candle. The one lone door was heavy oak, and had been most likely locked. Sure enough, as I rose slowly and walked stiffly over to it, I was unable to open it. I looked over to the candle, and my first thought of burning the house down came to mind. Good idea Meredith, I muttered. Never smart to burn a house down while you're locked inside. I looked all around the room in vain, trying to find a means of escaping before my captors came back. I sat down against one of the cold slabs of wall and sighed. A beetle scuttled in front of me. I eyed it, and my mouth began to salivate. A hand shot of, crushing the beetle in it's grasp, juice oozed out of it's decaying palm. The hand rose to my mouth, and I realized it was own. I swallowed the beatle ravenously, smacking my lips. My mind began to work faster, the room began to spin. Click, click, click- little pictures of what had happened began to form in my mind. My body seperated from my mind, both reeling and lurching with new rythyms and motion. Inside I was screaming, outside I was a beast. They had blood- induced me, Lily herself smiling broadly eyes blank and round like those of a great white shark. She had taken me as her prize, her toy. I was half awake when she pulled me to her. Her body was dead and rotten, chunks of flesh had dropped off, leaving molding pieces of bones and muscles filled with maggots. She pulled my face to hers and kissed me lightly on the cheek, her lips dry and cracked with blood. I pulled at her hair and her face in vain attempts to get away, but she just laughed darkly as her cold hands gripped my tighter. Her lips left a trail down my cheek, towards my neck. I felt her sharp fangs plunge into a big, fat juicy vein and for a brief spasm I shook with pain. My body crumpled after that, and I fell asleep- only to be thrown into this cell. It was complete I thought bitterly, as I snapped out of my reverie. I sat there, calmly watching my body lurch and grovel around the small barn, reeling and banging itself against the walls. I wanted meat, and blood and pain. I wanted to cause pain, and feel hurt seep within my pores. I knew it wasnt right, but then a deep laughter filled the tiny room. Maniac laughter that sputtered and kicked and growled. I looked around the room in surprise, only to find the laughter coming from deep within my soul...The monster had been born.

      Her hands ran across the keys Pail long stems pattered on the ivory Slow and graceful, like waterdrops The notes sounded from inside of her She closed her eyes, her body swayed so slightly I watched her intently Hands gliding over the piano She smiled Her eyes opened The stems drooped The waterdrops stopped and ran still Water running along slowly upon ivory hills She turned her head towards me And at that moment I would have given to world To give her my sight And to let her see how beautiful her playing really was But she will never see For her life is shrouded in darkness She will never see How inspired we all are by her

      Emotions hit like sledge blows Tears fall so easily when you're in love Pain is felt in each touch when you're alone Melody super imposed on skin That is what I view Your voice is a song to me A sweeping crescendo that makes my breath lift Your hands play an unspoken tribute to lovers all over the universe your eyes script life's climaxes And put them down on paper That is what I read  My heart is found in your lyrics My soul in your tune Thank you for living in my world That is why I love you.

       Memoir of Rhapsody in Blue  She sat enraptured Caught in the wave of sound It swept her out the room And into the hall It's beats pulled on her hair And lifted her off her feet Bands swam by Rocking and playing merrily Instruments floated in the deep She lay at the bottom of this music tide And let the music carry her out to sea Washing against her body, rocking it As though in a strange reel She moved her fingertips in front of her Keeping time of the sandy floor All the while the orchestra kept playing This beautiful rhapsody That she would never forget

      Immortality preys upon the wanderings of our innocent minds.  Unreachable, just out of thought and conscience it dwells. For faith brings us upon the boundary of this unthinkable pleasure Makes us question who we are, what morals we live upon If longevity were to become obsolete, infinity would prosper What time would be treasured, what memories replenished At the end of the day- you have to ask yourself Would eternal youth really be a thing of beauty Or an afterthought that holds us in the prisons of our souls.

       Prodigy  and she dropped her paintbrush on the palet Blood-red paint spattering her shirt Like a horrible incident She leaned on the edge of her chair to admire her work She viewed her subject as it lay now decapitated on her bed Once a lover, now a forgotten enemy She smiled with grim satisfaction The pen is mightier than the sword  she sang in a light voice And swept out of the room to create more masterpieces

      He sat calmly Almost serenely I guess you could call it The radio drifted in through the window Lazy and slow But calm and happy The news blared from the living room Another dead, another murdered said the solemn anchor All the same, he murmured and shook his head Good thing I'm not like them, he smiled And Sat on the cold bathroom floor- razor slowly slicing away his life Blood pooled in puddles on hard marble A man lay dead- to be known on the six o'clock as another death People would shake their heads And listen with grim satisfaction Good thing I'm not like that, they'll nod to each other And go about their lives in a rapt ignorance that keeps us going

      and the people turned their skys to the heavens, as the clouds roared with fury and the sky snarled it's head in rage. Tremors shook the earth like a rag, violently and without shame. Deep cracks flew through the land, fire rose and destroyed all life within it's path. Icy tendrils ran rampant through the northen hempisphere, freezing and torturing and sealing off the innocent. Trees were tossed in waves of havic, animals burned, villages plundered. A silent scream silenced by a giant hand. An eerie death filled the smoke-raped land. Apacolypse now uttered the devil softly to himself.

      they used to be friends once an immortal essence neither thought could melt their springs brought forth new life their laughter melded into something too beautiful they would dance together deep in the wooded trees figures running, blurred into oblivion captivation spread it's tendrils their love so innocent and child- like the trees would whisper and bend their branches wind hollowed through wooded pine love basked on a deep stone within a hidden pond Together, through the years they grew And though the stone fell to the depths of the pool And the woods slowly burned down Embers glowed with memories Water rippled with the laughter of an innocence lost, but not forgotten

      We had a summer Rasberry lips sticky with sun  Bees asleep on fat daisies We would sit there in our dandelion shade Citrus breeze licking the hot air Fat cotton clouds lazy as you and I And that was our summer Our summer of sprinkler mists and massive oaks Our summer of dust and dirt and pine and sweat Our summer of losses and counts and runs and water And in the midst of it Your hair caught in the wind Lips a deep plum from berries I'll catch you And hold you in a little glass box So I can remember our summer

       Lethal  The base slipped farther into insanity Music and heat filled in the gaps between the dancers Sweat and lust poured from their bodies As they all danced in the darkness Machinery melded with deep voices blared from throbbing speakers She swayed in the middle of the chaos Raven hair wild and long Eyes green and electric Pale lips parted and pouted She flew round and round Combat boots stomping the ground White arms swinging and laughing And to this She declared loudly To this lifestyle I dedicate me She laughed and raised her arms and spun in a circle To think she mused  That before I was a vampire I missed all this As she licked her lips and swayed her body in time with the music

      Step off the horizon Take my hand, and I'll show you my world she whispered so gently for a child of eight. He grinned fiercely and reached for her hand. She shrank back and looked at him wide eyed Promise she purred Promise you won't harm my dreams here He swept up her hand and kissed it gently Causing a crimson flush to spread across her cheeks Of course  he said deeply and with well practice Off they took And she showed him the world of a child The age of innocence And he smiled fiercely and raised his hand to her Down fell the laughter Slashed were her dreams Her land lay in ruins She lay sprawled in the middle And looked up to him with wide, shocked eyes You promised She said in a hurt voice Tears flowing into ash His shadow rose above her And he grinned  And turned his back and walked up the hill back to reality He cast a glance back at her and laughed Didn't anyone ever to tell you? His eyes burned Never trust the Devil

      Inspiration drops on the rooftops SIlent little tear stones Plinking so quietly on the cobble stone Inside our little girl curls nestled Deep inside a humble afghan Her eyes so widely peer through the frosted glass They watch the diamonds float down And begin to spin in those glistening snow globes She is fragile and beautiful They are pure and light Her window to the world Is light and dark But today it's merely our little girl reflecting on herself

       Forgotten  They're skin was long past rotting Like ancient leaves hidden under wet piles of dirt It flaked and slipped off their worm filled bones They smelled of death Of hurt and pain and nausia Long had their reign over earth begun Long had their souls been poured over ivory bones Their eyes were bloodshot and thirsty Lifeless and barren She was one of them A monster on the verge of sadistical And through the streets she roamed with them In search of fresh blood Ravaging, pillaging, forcing So the descructed became the desctructers And then she chanced upon it A young babe hidden in the rubble She slid into the room moaning Hair falling out of a dirty skull And heard a faint cry She turned slightly Her toothless smile turning upward into a pirate's grin She slid over to the wreckage expecting a injured prey But came upon this you infant Left behind So innocent it looked up at her with wide adoring eyes and burbled softly, arms outstretched She stumbled back in disbelief Emotion that had been long forgotten came flooding back She softling reached over Hands decayed and brittle And picked up the soft bundle Gazing at the object of innocence She gave a muffled cry and drew the child softly to her chest It's heat poured into her long forgotten heart Her children had been like this once too And then she remembered what it was like to love once again

      well....after a major revamping of my room, i must say I am thoroughly satisfied with the results. Classic black and white photos on red walls, red and white and gray sheets....it'll be lovely when it's done. Unfortunately, I have lost my journal...and am currently searching for it in utter chaotic unrest. If you have it, give it back you heartless creep, if you wanna help me look- come on over

       Chapter One             Perhaps I had lived to long to remember what childhood was supposed to be. Perhaps indeed, I had been man for far to long to have any boy left in me. Cora was the same. Her small body was fragile, especially for a girl of 10, but when I looked closely I could see the old woman inside, gasping for breath and hunching over so many burdens and so many memories. Cora and I lived in such a different time then now. Our time was 100 years ago, 1850 back in Wyoming out on Poppa's farm. It had been a happy time, an era of wealth, prosperity and a myriad of friends and family. Cora and I were but young children, mere babes as I see it now. 10 and 12, Cora and I respectively had helped Poppa on the farm, doing chores, cooking and greeting the unending river of friends stopping by in rushes of hugs, warmth and fresh bread.  I still recall those days with a satirical laugh.  Such naivity and freshness we had exuded, Cora and I often lament, such easy prey we were.            I remember the day he came. "Tall man!" Cora had whispered in a awed, hushed voice and she darted into the barn. I was gathering Chicka's eggs and sat down on a bench and wiped my brow with a dirty hankerchief as I had seen Poppa done a thousand times before. "What's this about?" I asked solemnly. Cora had a way of creating myths and fabrications, and thus I was not alarmed. Her dark brown eyes opened wide and she tried to measure this man's length with her pale, slender arms. "Bigger than the horses!" She crowed, brown eyes dancing and sparkling. She danced around and twirled her arms, sending tumbles of dark black hair tumbling out of her bonnet. "Coraline Maria Solden!" I admonished loudly, standing up and knocking over my basket of eggs. I yelped as they tumbled out, rolling over the hay and across the dirt. Cora laughed and we both plopped down on the ground to start retrieving them. I crawled around on all fours and was just about to scoop up the last little white treasure when it was picked up for me. I remember his hands being the first thing I saw, and already I knew something was wrong. Long, pale, sharp fingers. Fingers the color of milk, unlike the tanned, calloused fingers I was used to seeing around the farm. They transformed into long arms, covered with a stiff black suit. So long, so lean and so wrong for our sunny, informal home. I rose slowly, letting my eyes soak in the abberation. "Here son, you dropped this," The voice was stiff, as though mechanic and not oiled properly. I took the egg from the outstretched fingers, careful not to touch them for fear of catching the length disease this man obviously had. I looked up and gazed at his face. Pale as his hands, if not paler. Wavy black hair, black as Cora's tied into a neat ponytail at the nape of his neck. Pale lips, thin and parted slightly to reveal two perfectly lined points of white soldiers ready to fight. A thin, slanted noise pointing down sharply, black eyes, blacker than coals or midnight. He rose to at least 6 feet 6 inches, from his black boots to his coarse, brown felt hat, maybe more, for as a child I was inept at measuring distances with my eyes. I muttered a weak thank you and fell back in line with Cora, who looked just as forlorn as I. My father stepped out from behind the man, wringing his hat and refusing to look either of us in the eye. "Kids," He said in a fallaciously cheery voice, "This is my....friend Lukander Voss" Poppa tried to meet my eyes but couldn't. "He's going to be...staying with us for a while- he has business in town." Cora and I exchanged furtive glances. Business in our town of 5,000 consisted of a new plow or buying live stock- neither of which Mr. Voss seemed familar with. Mr. Voss coughed uncomfortably and shifted his feet. His boots scraped on the dusty barn floor, sending up a cloud of dust. "Well, I'm very happy to be staying with you!" His voice was loud, and out of place. I looked over to see Cora wince slightly, my reaction as well. As he and Poppa stepped out into the sunlight, Cora and I sat down heavily, leaning against Chicka's pen walls. She led out a whoosh of air and I merely nodded. As we look back on these times of trivial youth, we become furious with our past selves for not beingmore aware of the ominous feelings we were both having.

       Prologue   "Cool night," I whispered to her, shaking sand from my hair. She was next to me, silent and noble as a cliffside and merely nodded. "Do you think they know?" I whispered quickly, almost frightened.  Her form moved slowly so I could see her whole face. She sank one hand into the cool, damp sand and began to sift it thoughtfully through her fingers. She gave me a comforting smile- always so affectionate. "No, my dear,"she said slowly, as though words were a burden, "They have no idea. Let us rest now." I turned my gaze away from her and back to the ocean. Vast and powerful, it raised its mighty fists and surged great white stallions ahead, careening them dangerously into the mountainside. So quiet, I thought, so quiet on such a painful night. I kicked off my scuffed shoes, tossing them towards a blanket we had set up, then forgotten. My feet wriggled into the cold mush of sea water and sand. She looked over, shot me a glance and opened her mouth as though to ridicule, but then closed it promptly. Her mouth made a loud popping noise as it closed and I giggled. She looked suprised, but then laughed faintly, turning back to watch the ocean. I leaned against my palms and began to rise. "Parker," She said softly, "Oh Parker, where are you going?" I stood up, brushing the sand from my faded trousers and shaking my limbs as a boy of 12 does. "Just to go feel the water, Cora" I said in an almost pleading voice. Cora's eyes turned upwards towards me. The moonlight lapped in those dark, serious pools, "Oh...please Parker, just stay with me and wait." Her small form pleaded silently with me.I sighed loudly, an exasperated sigh but a defeated on at that. I dropped to the ground, sending a spray of sand into the dark night.

      There's a cure for you and me There's a little thing we never did see Deep inside each of us Is just a little bit of soul Worrying about everything will take it's toll  So my friend why do you worry About the constant scurry Life is full of it Can't you just take it all in turn Baby just watch the sun burn  A little sun and a little rain Take it all in place of pain The sun can cast a shadow But just take it as a pleasure Laying in shade is a happiness you can't measure

       For we Are the Fortunate Few   sometimes my view of the world seems slightly askew Sometimes I see dreams float away When they should have never been lost Sometimes I watch men and women weep For companions that should not have died Sometimes I watch the news To forget about my happiness

       Playroom  A childhood dream manifested into plastic happiness A playroom built for these little darlings Feast upon their innocent minds A cube of color, sound and light Designed to enrich and love Their own little room  They whispered Pigtails bouncing, shoelaces tripping Bright chrome doorknob opens into the womb Inside their toys giggle and breathe The door clicks behind them Hard metal sliding into the lock They giggle and pretend as the lights turn off A silent hand takes their screams Their pasted smiles cut off As the darkness turns into a growl What was supposed to be a electronic mother A safe living quarter Decided not to let her children ever leave again Better they stay safe in the dark, still and quiet then have to brave the outside world Their parents lay sobbing on the outside Pounding on the metal walls Begging for their offspring But the circuits shook their head and tapped their foot No, no she crooned Their safe, and so so quiet now.

       This is What you Made Me Do  When you wake tommorow When you come home and remember I wasn't there Nod your heads kids I bet you won't think otherwise CLick on the TV And Gasp when you see my yearbook picture I never did like On the Six o'Clock news She'll tell you solemnly about the young highschool student You saw me laughing The one with the bright eyes and crazy ideas She'll tell you, hands folded, make up painted on What a tragedy Solem lips, blank eyes Nod your heads kids Remember me

      I close my eyes after a long day Lashes brush my cheek as I try to forget Bright lights fire off behind closed doors As my brain tries so in vain to turn off A pale hand sweeps quietly over a memory Scoops it into the shallow fingers  And pours the nightmare off the bed There it lays pooled Shimmering dark and menacing As I lay curled and shaking  It tries so desperately to reach me Its apparent yearn for flesh is seen This flirtation with the obscene Has taken form And devoured my soul So i lay in vain As it creeps slowly, so slowly back into my bed To seep into my eyelids Shut, but not locked to the pains of you.

      I'm not from here A little abberation that was not meant to be found Differences in little terms I came here for a crime to be repayed Your planet Is my home's hell Feel guilty? No? Good We're all here to pay for our sins And to relive what we have done I'm here biding my time Sitting back in the shadows watching the turmoil Waiting until they let me go back home Waiting until I've served my time On your planet you call Earth But we call Hell

      And this This is the story of my life I sit here, hair tucked securely behind my ears, biting my top lip as I try to tell you what has happened Our existence, my life and yours and the man in the corner in the back of the bus They all matter and are discovered at one time or another by each other My life is just a facet of yours A simple thread of knowledge and date you can store and remember, or even forget So how do I tell you what has gone on in my presence? How do you describe torment to it's justice? How can you ever really capture security and the presence of instability? I want to share my story with you Will you listen to what I have to say More importantly, will you care The effect of myself on people is minimal If I were to never exist the world would still spin, the lottery would continue ripping people off and you would most likely still fail your math quiz tommorow So how do we know whether or not youre missing someone? How am I supposed to tell  the story of my life If I don't even know if it's the real version The fabric of life is full of wrinkles and holes Have I just slipped through? How am I supposed to relate to this world of complexity When I find myself searching for troubles of my own A story that has no beginning No middle And no end? So I sit here, friends and foes, without a means of retaliation All I know, is my hair is still tucked behind my ears, and my lip is still being bitten All I know is that I'm here, and my life is mine to own

      Too long had he felt his mother earth tremble and shake for too fortunate he had been to be sacrificed as one of he survivors The Great War, they had whispered among hushed, awed voice hidden behind dry newspapers and lacy hankeerchiefs Now, he, a boy lay amidst this great glory and did not find its glory to be so grand Boys who had made him yell uncle in sunny pastures just mere months ago now screamed in a real, unfiltered torment Limbs severed, the constant stink of rotting flesh Dirty, tattered clothes and courage was all that remained of his battalion He lay in a crumbling foxhole Dark and as morbid as the tomb he was sure to occupy soon Smoke-soaked, light blonde hair fell into his eyes Pushing it aside he remembered his mother suddenly and the tears fell down quiety from his clear sky eyes His mother's soft warm image caused him to shake and sob uncontrollaby Bringing his knees up to his chin he wrapped his arms around himself as they sky above darkened and more and more dirt fell in the hole in tremors Raising his eyes to the now dark sky He rocked back and forth as though once again a young child back on his family's farm On the other side of this world, a young man, not much older than our young soldier is given orders to barrage the enemy's barracks with deadly gas bombs As the murky grey air begins to settle into his little tomb, our soldier feels lethargy creeping into his limbs, as slow and silent as death itself.  One more silen tear and another brave boy has died for his country.

      And I'm coming back Back to when I was much stronger than you I'm picking up slack And running towards Everything you though you could ignore I've become much stronger Through all the hits you've dealt I've picked up that extra adrenaline That you thought you bottled up and stored away Now I see your illusions Now I can see who you really are And as I'm running past you and yours I see only blurs As your try to reach out and stop me All you grab is air Thank you Thank you for making me realize That I am so much more than this

      I'm just a girl Such a little, tiny girl Sitting on a park bench Wrapped up in dad's old Harvard Sweatshirt Eyes dropping tears onto the cement slab That I sit so quietly on Passerbys hurry past Eyes sliding from big department store to the next Not even noticing me Suddenly I'm in highschool Sitting at a desk, one of thirty five in a tiny classroom A teacher stands up front, eyes cold and hard Sliding from person to person Not even noticing me As I sit here with the same silent tears And the same old sweatshirt All my life I've just wanted to be noticed All my life I've just wanted to care

      I remember so distinctly being a scared, skinny twelve year old staring back at the dirty mirror in a Macy's dressing room. The glaring light beat down on my stringly hair and gawky limbs. I remember so clearly tugging at a pair of bell bottoms that were too big and not right and watching as a silent tear fell down my freckled cheek. You see, when you're little the world doesn't seem to care at all. I've grown up from that little girl into something more. Last night I sat cross- legged in front of my own mirror in designer jeans and a victoria secrets bra and pushed back a lock of hair. Biting my lip I came to realize that my body may have grown up, my hair may have become more stylish, and my friends increasingly more high profile and abundant, but I am still that little girl. To society I have always been an abberation. You've all tried to pin me down as one teenage experiment but I can't tell you the hours of self pity I have accumulated.I have popular friends, gorgeous amazing boyfriends, wonderful parents and a beautiful home but inside I still am deep within a dimly lit Macy's store, trying so hard to fit in and just be part of the teenage masses. I remember wearing those bell bottoms to the first day of sixth grade, so nervous and hoping just anyone would talk to me. I remember just as well going to first period and tripping in the door to have some 6th grade punk laugh at my shirt and pants and hair. I was gawky yes, but ironically the same boy commented on how pretty I was just last week. To all of you, I've grown into something pretty and funny and strong. TO me, I'm still stuck tugging at a poorly cut shirt and trying so desperately to figure out why you all laugh at me behind my back. When you're little, the world doesn't seem to care. When you're big, you come to the realization it just doesn't. So this is a story, a tale of a little girl who has grown into her body, but has yet to grow up.

      shhhhh just for one night lets let the night slow down just for one fateful evening let me place my hand in yours as we watch the summer sun set quiet down and realize words arent needed as we walk together  as the world goes spinning by come rest your head on my shoulder and we can watch the fireflys wrap your arms around me and tell me you love me just as the moon rises into it's final resting spot the sun may be jealous, but the moon will be the final witness of our last days together

      Friends! He said so gallantly Hands sweeping up the air and turning it to gold Welcome to my Oasis! His teeth grinned and his eyes winked a cornflower blue They shuffled their feet uncomfortably and looked around Convicts, murderers and and rapists stood huddled in a group Scarred, tattoed, dirty bodies stood awkwardly in formation My brothers! He called out in his starched, tailored suit Do not fear, for I have  saved  you! His coal black shoes shone silently like two patient puppies Sitting by their master's sides The men relaxed a little, one tittered softly, another lightly chucked his neighbor's shoulder and they looked at their surroundings in awe Welcome! His voice softened and his brillant twinkling eyes danced Embrace your new home His tanned long fingers parted and raised towards the heavens The men by this time were laughing and smiling, one had taken off his cap and flung it gallantly into the air My father! Sang one of the men to all the others I see my faith in God has paid off! He crowed to a particularly violent serial killer next to him The man in front of them grew agitated at this outburst The shiny new shoes clicked and tapped on the ground You realize you're dead then, all of you He said, eyeing them cautiously This is most unfortunate... His hands wrung and twisted the beautifully crafted browned fingers The men slowed their dancing and came to a halt, once again in the awkward configuration that they had begun in A brave soul, a young rapist, stepped towards their savior eyes full of trust and hope We've come to serve God he said in a small voice I can speak for my brothers when I say we know we've made mistakes but... Silence! Savior's voice grew sharp and tense, cutting through his gold polished air and dulling the shine of his eyes As I said before, I've rescued you! He grew excited, hands twisted more, sweat appearing on his brow You will not have to have faith in God any longer my sons! For I am your new savior! The assasins, slayers, killers and pain inducers of the world began to tremble in fear Their spokeman, a young man who had silenced the woman who had said no, now walked towards Savior once again  Where are we father? He asked submissively, eyes downcast and cap in hands Savior's eyes flashed, now as jet as the tailored suit Well don't you know boys? His voice was no longer welcoming, but sarcastic and cruel Oasis, Oasis! He said, maniac laughter bouncing off the walls The young man tried once again Please, father- are we in limbo? Is our fate decided yet? His eyes seemed hopefull as though he thought he had a chance Father looked down upon the men and began to chuckle softly Your fate, little soldiers is already done His hands, long and tan pointed downwards From here, we only go down and down, deeper and deeper The men began to tremble, fear began to pump into their hearts His million dollar suit seemed to gleam importance Normally I don't come up here for just anyone, but for a group of men as important as yourselves... His smile grew large, his eyes grew a dull film over the brillance How silly of me, I have yet to fully introduce myself He stood tall and made a most gallant bow to his subjects I am The Devil, and this, gentlemen is Hell....enjoy your stay.

      What it is to cry what pains have we reached in our lives To show this brushing of weakness to the pillars of society That seem so strong and brutal They're made of stone and are never to be broken  What makes a weaker man weep upon his eminent death when fate has already played a steady hand Such a subtle way of expression such a gentle thrill released through sorrow Sorrow, oh what a fitting word to describe these tears sorrow has been a dark shadow, hidden but always in attendance To the men and women who are the supports and backbones of this society to the shoulders who have felt such a heavy burden to keep us all normal and unassuming Your tears are dammed, hushed and dried your tears are the water we use to quell our starving minds a silent toast, watch as we raise our glasses to you, my silent friend who writhes in unvoiced agony a toast to your pain, a toast to our gain

      Cant think of a title- something like "dr. seuss on depressants?"  something from deep inside my head fills my heart with a resonating dread whispered rumors form into whispered tales they take shape and substance and float upon gales softly they drop atop my shoulder tiny but deadly, as they sit each a boulder their songs lick my ears and prob in my morals the yarns tell of stories, of old and new quarells they leave my heart blackened, my soul feeling week for they have left our outcome love, as very near bleak

      Ok so since I obviously am addicted to the computer I might as well make this my daily rantings too. Sister left today and for those of you who don't know her (be thankful). Valedictorian, graduated Stanford in three years and now anal as hell. So my foil and my foe is related to me- ironic. Luckily she's 9 years older (big age difference because I was adopted) and is the homeowner of some overly expensive apartment in San Fran with her husband who is brain blessed as well. As my parents and sister left for "quality bonding time" I decided to fake a headache and procrastinate packing. I leave for Kansas tomorrow, you know that state that's flat and Dorothy rocks out with that little dog, Frodo or Kiki or something. I'm going to visit relatives, which will actually be fun because I'm sandwiched in age between my two closest cousins- cool cats all around. All I can say is, farm boys + single Cali girl = ....good times

      I could run my head through these lies again and again I could pretend you care and actually meant to wave I could stare at photographs aged and frozen And I could simply lose myself in the past we never had I wish you would see I never meant to I wish that things had happened now I wish your smile was meant for me But instead I'm here instead of there  I realize now I'm meant for more I realize now I shouldn't have I realize now said words I didn't mean Now comes the time when I regret I regret I regret I regret....

      In life I feel like sometimes letting go Like sitting on the edge of a bridge, looking out onto a river Those men you see on TV who sit there sobbing Hope already down in the raging water below You see them shaking and feel a fleeting glimpse of compassion for them But I I relate to these men sometimes In life It's those cold autumn nights that leave you lost Sitting in a window seat blowing hot air onto frosted panes Look out and notice me In life It's just become easier and easier to sit down and bow your head Fingers clasped and eyes shut In life It's become simpler to use a excuse to come go home rather than to live under the stars In life, the world has been turned inside out, enveloping us all

      Out upon the evening sky Lay spread a tangible faith Lept among the stars it purrs A divine intuition too great to grasp  Here a mind lay in it's deepest recesses Poured from the blackest midnight Stolen from the pools of the deranged A horrific speculation too horrible to convey  As fog lifts its veil, her eyes are shown Look, they murmur, how her beauty does glow Like the brillant sky, her charm is unsung Her eyes, they whisper in hushed tones, are as raven as the night  But what they fail to see comrades Is the vacancy from within For deep within this hallowed place Lays a writing, wickled, screaming face

      I could write a poem for you A simple proclamation that shows my intent But how do you show,  show someone how deep they've gotten just how far into your mind and soul they've probed I want to thank you my friend and so much more for finding, finding me hidden in the dark and with those bright eyes and laugh that breaks the shadows off the walls Remember for years past and gone Don't forget bright lights, city nights and simple lessons together we learned, hand in hand I could write a poem for you A simple splendid ovation would not do you justice We stand tall and proud and together Thank you

       I do make mistakes  the biggest mistake of my life was letting you forget who we were the problem i can't let myself get past is how i can't get past my feelings and just let you go so i sit here, snowflake boxers and white sports bra, hair in a bun and chopsticks in hand, staring at what i used to have and hating myself for letting it go apologies are hollow, pleading is not enough so i am stuck in the middle, realizing my errors and knowing there's nothing i can do a simple statement, anything i could do i would just t remember what it was like to be cared about again

       Irony  A society aimed towards resolving the bad Shoots and fires and ends up hitting the innocent pedestrian passing out choir flyers Big tall men in expensive black suits stand tall and looming and rule us all But hide behind stacks of papers and sturdy oak desks Teenagers lash out against conformity And stand together in huddled masses to protest for their individuality Teachers are the foundation of our society, educating those who will save our lives and bring justice to this world Yet women sliding down poles wearing nothing are paid a higher salary Welcome to America, home of fake blondes, fake breasts and real problems

       A story to read before Dying  It's just a quiet thought written from the back of my mind A silly proclamation of my feelings in life scrawled on a notebook in the back of the bus I sit, knees propped up against the dirty plastic seat in front of me Notepad in my lap, pen behind tapping impatiently between two tired fingers Hair pushed back into a chipped hair clip, falls out of place as I fight a losing battle to keep it up Distractions come in the form of crying babies, fighting couples and the constant clank of an underfed engine But still my pen wears on, silent and strong as a soldier in battle I may get jostled, and my pen may slip But the words, they pour from me as they never have before These words, just letters written on a torn piece of recycled fluff My mind is whirring, faster and faster urging the pen to write on And so it toils, deep within this smoky, dark Greyhound I glance at the man next to me, a business man I guess He's not carrying luggage, or a briefcase of any kind, which intrigues me, so I will write of him He merely holds a worn photograph of a little girl in his palms Angelic and beautiful, she is caught mid laugh as the shutter snaps and the bulb flashes He cradles the picture tenderly and dearly He does not notice me glancing at it, for he can not tear his eyes from her A silent tear slides onto her smile, and slides down her chin and off the picture I look up suprised, for the man is now crying, shaking silently and still cradling his little girl I retreat back into my world of unstretched legs and broken hair clips And my battle wears on, as I write more and more of lost love or angry youth Once again my attention has hidden from me It laughs and jumps onto the lap of a young woman two seats up and one seat over Her eyes lay closed, and lines of worry lay forever etched into her skin Her head is shaved, as are her eyebrows She lays so silently, thin and frail No tears, no voice but just a quiet body being willed to survive I write of her because simply out of the respect I hold for her My attention leaps again, into the arms of a little girl running down the aisle Torn overalls and dirty blonde hair pulled into pigtails, I smile as I see myself so many years before She runs past me and I smile, and push back my hair instinctively She pauses in her youthful rush and stops in front of me, suddenly sending a draft of cotton candy and soil air towards me I inhale the smell of childhood and close my eyes for a moment They open and my little girl has moved on My notepad grows restless and shuts its pages My pen grows weary and retreats into my jacket pocket My hair grows frusturated and kicks the clip to underneath the plastic seat My fingers grow cold as the night approaches, and burrow into gloves they have discovered in my pack My mind grows old and pleads for sleep Knees still propped up by hardened plastic I wrap my arms around my body And glance out the window, down at the enveloping black highway below As I peer through that sticky, smudged window out into life I decide to just stay in my seat, writing and thinking about everything that is

       For all I've lost  As we turn off the radio that's already gone and thick with static As I stick my arm out of the window and let the air play games with it As we roll down the windows and let the hot air pour in As you press down just a little more on the gas As we don't look back and just see highway and each other As the hot sun overhead tries in vain to get to us As we realize that life is about lost moments As I watch you reach for my hand and hold it in yours As I let my hair be whipped and toyed As all the world seems to have merely fallen asleep in the afternoon sun As I watch you out of the corner of my eye As you lay one hand on the wheel, and one with mine I realize this is something I'll never forgot Thank you for making the ordinary extraordinary

      I don't know if this is going to make sense The world is faced with a growing aprehension Scrawled out on church doors and cult floors Are the writings of a society Obsessed with an idealistic man As a society from the dawn We are taught rules and regulations and beliefs From sturdy oak desks in private prep schools Some throw this knowledge away And travel the world in search of the truth The rest nod their heads with pasted smiles We call these men politicians

      ALright, an abberation from my norm...I was just reading my old blog and found a highly amusing, freshman "bored" list I made that makes me laugh...hahah! see? im laughing! hahaha...oh again! haha oh man its funny, here it goes:  Fun things to when you're hella bored  1.) Dress up in cheesy eighties clothes and sing along to Blink's "First Date" 2.) Put doll clothes on your dog (specially good if you have a four pound poodle) 3.) Put random pieces of clothing in the refrigerator and see how many people comment 4.) Play Monopoly with you parents and on your first turn run away and see what they do. 5.) FLush the toilet 23 times in a row...it gets really hypnotic 6.) Put on headphones and walk around the house pretending to listen to music. When your parents comment on the fact you have no cd player with you, look at them alarmed and go, "but where's the music coming from then?!" 7.) Sing along to Carol Burnett's "Little GIrls" and beat your barbies while doing it (for more realistic results, throw back a coupla bottles of Vodka before) 8.) See how many articles of clothing you can put on at one time. 9.)Sit outside on your driveway and wave at passing by cars...see how many people you can get to wave back. 10.) Ask your parents what this "sex" is that you've been hearing about at school...act dead serious, and really confused. 11.) Speak in old English, and when someone says something, exclaim loudly, "OFF WITH HIS HEAD!" and chase the person till they threaten to call the cops...then you run away. 12.) See how many different pop-up ads you can get in one minute on different websites, hold contests with your friends. 13.) Make pointless lists like I am right now 14.) Watch Disney Movies, and find all the similarites in them...there's a ton trust me. 15.) Play video games until you get a blister...it takes a long time 16.) Fill up socks with marbles and see how far you can hurl them. 17.) Hide behind a shrub or on a balcony and throw pebbles at passer-byers. If they look over, smile and say, "Merry CHristmas you bastards!" and then hide. 18.) FInd the top ten funniest/randomist words in the dictionary ex:lignite 19.) Make a top ten list of the poppiest pop songs. ex: Dream, he loves not; No Secrets, Kidz in AMerica 20.) Watch ALL of the Bond movies, and start quoting them on a regular basis.

      To my mother I have always been a disapointment To my father I am his little girl that grew up too fast To my sister I am a sad shake of the head And to her husband I am justification for marrying the above To my friends I am a little too large to nail down to just one little board To my grandmere I am a state of constant confusion that ceases to end To my aunts and my uncles I am just an expensive passerby To my cousins I am just far too above to actually try to pry And to you, you the reader I'm full of such anger I can't seem to fall out of myself So I thank, thank the public for trying to pin me down and find me wriggle away Do I dare? Do I dare disturb the universe?  Oh, I do...

      And I can be a female holden Full of forgotten dreams and double meanings I can be that dress left in the dark The one that doesn't fit  I can be a heroine brave and bold With a future that's unsteady I can be the love you never had Or everything in between  And I know That the longer I sit here the harder it gets to unwind So I ask For a question or answer that shows me why love is so blind  I am just a girl with a message Screaming in a silent room I am all the world trapped in one place Trying to be seen through it all  I am always complicated maybe exasperated and penetrated I am still five years old Feeling hurt and neglect and real pain  And I Know That you don't want to deal with the pain that I cause anymore So I ask Please pick up all you've broken and walk past all the lore  For I know That this world will get better but for now I am stuck in what's now Hence I ask Will you you stopping looking at me and just say what you mean out loud

      Forgotten friends lay dormant in distant shadows Laying hapless like earthed mermaids gasping for air Deep amidst the hallowed gloom Of their inescapable reverie They lie reminiscent of the days once loved Today is not day but in essence their night For they are the forgotten, the lost and the misplaced I left a comrade there As he slipped out of pocket I was not aware Fell as I ran towards the sun with my new belongings shiny and bright He lay like a torn photograph Being washed with acidic dark And as his photo slowly disengrated I didn't look back, though he had left his mark   I want to be remembered...

      I let you wash over me Eyes closed as that cool clean breeze whispers in my ear I let this memory of someone once forgotten Reminisce with all I had locked away They play a delicate, tangible tango Unaware of the repercussions their echoed footsteps create As much as this excites and exhilirates my body My soul has retreated to a melancholy corner Leave me broken While I can still pick up the pieces

      If all this music could just stop playing If the clinking of forks and the tipping of glasses could cease If the mindless laughter and pointless chatter were to die Maybe I could hear  If everyone would stop running and kicking up dirt If all the bright lights and sequined dreams were cut off If pretty faces and exotic places were to just disapear Then maybe I could see If all the problems were to drain away Then maybe I could start to live But what's life without a little drama?

      I leave tommorow for another couple of weeks at camp...but before I do, I think I'll leave you with one more lasting impression of me:  I live strong As my mother taught me to hold my chin up Up above their words and feeble hits As my grandmother held my head while I cried I learned compassion and strength don't have to clash I live for today And instead of holding back and biting my lip I take flying leaps and yell back at everyone and everything I learned from a young age that perfection is indeed imperfections learned I live in peace Because my sister taught me as a child to care about laughter rather than harm It's because of my empowerment And the idea of choice That I live I.  Live.

      My dreams, I'm afraid have grown worse. For in these reveries I find my death so eminent so graphic. It is with a culpable fascination that I hide them Each by Each by the stark of midnight. I take them out secretly One by one and revel in the juicy desire of pain I so badly yearn to entreat upon myself. Do not pity me, Friend. I would rather you merely observe and take part in this delicious perversion of  the human soul.

      Well, I'm off for another session of camp- So i won't be updating for a while...Try not too miss me too much, eh mates? Just got back from dinner with Grandmere (my grandmother) which entailed her opening the door, looking me up and down, taking notice I'm sure of my lime green running shorts and messy ponytail, and leading me in, shaking her head and muttering in German...oh I don't need to speak German to know what she was saying. Translation: Ohhhh Diane will never marry, for who would want to marry this tall, headstrong girl who wears shorts the color of LIMES?! Why can't she be more like her sister, the good, dependable, Stanford Grad who marries a computer engineer????  I'll tell you why, Grandma.....because I'm different and crazy and yes dramatic, and that's how I am and will always be :)  ::Yes I know I'm different I know it's true Behind hushed doors I'm talked about A mere controvesery sparked by intolerance Yes I know I'm not different Yes, I know it's true But in the end love I'm just glad I'm not like you And you And you...::

      Back on a break from camp, sleeping, eating and doing laundry (and I wonder why I left camp...)Anyways, camp is awesome- last session I was in a unit called Snoqualmie which consisted of 19 little 2nd and 3rd grade girls (h e c t i c) lets just say we had at least one bed wetter a night, one major sickness, about a dozen homesick girls and and least 100 instances of lost socks, hats or water bottles...but I still love it like no other. Most unforgettable camp memory so far? Last night campfire, it was probably in the low 40's in temperature so I gave up my sweatshirt and long sleeve shirt to the little girls next to me leaving me in shorts and a short sleeve sweatshirt :( However, I had a little girl curled up in my lap and one on each side with my arms around them, trying to keep them all warm. It would have been miserable, except as I was trying to distract them by singing "Lean on Me" softly and rocking them, Shelbi- the little girl wrapped in my sweatshirt in my lap- looked up at me and whispered in my ear, "You're the nicest person I've ever met" and then proceeded to fall asleep on me, snoring softly. I think right then and there I have never felt so fulfilled...so this post is dedicated to my little children, all 19 of them....may you always be loud, and crazy and just the little girls you are meant to be...  ::I've grown up they've told me Into someone repectable who never crosses the line I used to be just like you love A runner and singer Dancing in tune to shaken heads and tsk tsk tsks I might have grown up I might have grown old But in the end love I refuse to die cold::

      I've always been a stationary icon A memory of someone who used to dream My laughs come seldom now Quiet, tiny diamonds falling out of my pocket one by one My smile is always hidden Boxed up and put away with last year's Christmas decorations I've always been the girl known as nothing more A wisp of someone brave and bold And now that wisp is floating away I often sit on the park bench I stare at nothing in particular If i could I would travel the world picking up my lost laughter If i could I would travel the world and Retrieve my smile  I i could I would travel the world And find myself

      It's all about the velvet streets Lined with smoke encrusted metal tables Set so seductively with muted candles Laying quietly, flickering on the tops A simple scene filled with lust and thought Here the beautiful pale poets and intellectuals Lay in ancient chairs Black berets curled amongst the steam of fresh cofee  Under street lights purring a flame too lazy to burn bright Under the heavens melancholy and deep as the thinkers that lay beneath her And under the steep buildings full of mothers and old men waiting to die The few, proud citizens argue and triumph and laugh In this captivating city we call Paris

      You can grow up Older in ways and years Flare up with glowing eyes Let it all bother you and catch yourself in between But through it all In the end You are all you have

      Maybe as a child I was hurt Left amongst a crowded room of angry souls Torn and tattered to lie in the corner All the while smiling through plastic hopes Maybe you posed as a caregiver Threatening and screaming behind closed doors That lay locked and shut to all your friends and critiques. Maybe I deserved better Maybe you deserved less Maybe it was all a dream Maybe it was a nightmare to real to be viewed as such.

      On another quick break from camp...I must say though, I have missed this blog more than a lot of people I know. This summer has definetly changed me more than any other one thing. I got a lot more tanner, muscular, and grew up more than I ever though was humanly possible. I guess being in charge of 30 2nd and 3rd grade girls and knowing that they depend on you to sustain life is a sobering fact. I've made mistakes in life, hell I've been irresponsible and selfish and covered myself in lies and misleadings to make myself look better. But when you're carrying a little girl over a mile to the health center because your walkie talkie breaks and you're up a mountain and she's got a fever and is throwing up and shaking and feeling dizzy....then my friend, you grow up and you realize just how minimal and unimportant you, just YOU are. These little girls are the reason I came to camp. The reason I spend my senoir summer in the blaring heat stuck isolated in mountains with 80 other staff all in college cleaning and singing and hiking our brains out. This summer, I've learned to stick up for what I believe in, to look at the big picture, and hell- most of all, to care...
