      well, it's done. i paid my taxes. who knows if they're right, but I'm feeling much more confident now that it's all sent off. although, it did indicate that i won't get confirmations from the FTB or the IRS for 48 hours.   so, seriously, ellen uninvited us to the giants exhibition game tomorrow night. so typical. but, it looks like we're going to head out for pub quiz. which is still good. it's funny—mike and i have been in this very weird, goofy mood this week. we seriously spent the majority of monday evening sitting on top of the covers and basically making weird noises and faces at each other. totally dorky, but i feel so close to him.   speaking of, i was going over plans with my mom for our little massage trip this weekend. and thinking about mike and dad heading out for a mexican food lunch on saturday. i'm so insane that my brain flitted over to the following:  I wonder if Mike will ask my father for permission to marry me?  Seriously, do i need this thoughts in my brain? One of these days, I'll be OK with letting this happen in a logical time frame that I am not in charge of. one of these days, i swear...

      ugh!! i owe one thousand, two hundred freakin' dollars for my taxes? i didn't get much but i think i got at least $100 back last year, and now i owe twelve times that. eek!   i think i need to find a tax professional for next year. it would be quite nice to have someone to explain all this stuff. i hate it—i'm a rather smart, intuitive person and i've just never been able to devote the time to understand my taxes. it freaks me out. but, as i recall there's a ghetto little tax attorney guy on balboa, it'll be nice to give this to someone and have some explanation of the whole process.   thankfully [sic], i'm making less money this year and will hopefully be paying less taxes. ugh. all-around, ugh.

      i feel like i should be typing something. the t-mobile team is in the conference room in front of me. they've got crits up on the glass wall, so they're all staring in my direction, but not necessarily at me. but perhaps they are, i posed for one of the package designs, so one of the crits is me standing there holding a samsumg phone. that's what i get for being the 'average white girl' in the office. i always thought i was a bit unusual, but let's do a run down of the office demographics:   1 gay, french/jewish male 1 married, french/jewish male 1 ambiguous asian male 1 gay, blond male 1 gay, asian male 1 gay, blond male 1 divorced/straight, male 1 straight, asian female 1 straight, indian female 1 gay, malaysian male  and on top of it all our youngest male is dating the company owner. gotta love it. but, overall it makes for a very happy, fun group. there's lots of talk of theater and shopping and i often feel like my clothes really should be of some sort of brand name. it almost reminds of junior high when i was desperately pleading for guess jeans and that esprit shirt. nonetheless, a good group of people. :)

      ooof. so lazy. so i took last week off from the gym as a birthday present to myself. and now i can't seem to get back into it. i meant to go yesterday morning and again this morning. today—as got up to turn off the alarm and set it for later—i announced that it was "too cold" to go to the gym. seriously, i live in California. granted, northern california, but it couldn't have been below 45 degrees outside. i hope to go tonight and i packed a good, healthy lunch. if i'm not going to work out, i shouldn't eat like a fatty. :)

      holy crap. a client just called and i seriously had to walk him through how to change the font on a document he was using. egad! we went from using the edit menu to select all (i wasn't about to attempt to explain key commands) and then over to the formant menu, font, a good font to use and then an appropriate size. how in the world do these people become business owners?

      ah, the wonders of working in a private company. today we had 24 boxes of cookies delivered from a potential client. a potential client. someone we're trying to court is sending us things. unreal. These sinfully delicious delectables are now sitting in the kitchen awaiting the sugar-hungry designers. that's a lot of cookies! seriously. we only have 13 people in this office. 3 of which are out today. ridiculous. i swear i've gained weight working for the private sector.   yet, the extra five pounds is worth the amiable work environment. the holidays—while working for the state—were depressing. it was insanely difficult to get people out of their cubicles to join in any type of group activity. folks were either far too busy and holed up in their fabric-covered spaces or holed up in their fabric covered spaces surfing the internet. me, i wavered between the two.

      ooo—so that worked out quite nicely. i've changed the font to my liking and now have an incredible urge to teach myself html once again. i know just enough to get me in trouble. i understand the mechanics, but don't pay have the attention span to truly *know* every code. i always end up with tables cutting things in funny places and crazy fonts busting out all over the place.   but for now, i'll just concentrate on the ramblings part.

      ah yes, so i'm a reformed diaryland poster. i used to only feel moderately like a 20-something dork when i began 3 years ago. i stopped posting for a year or so and then revisited today. now, i'm an older 20-something dork on a site overrun with sugary teenagers, including those sugary teenagers who are trying so hard to be dark and brooding.   with that, i'll post this and see how it all works. i've got time on my hands at the office and a lot of rumblings in my head. this should be quite nice.

      OK, fighting a lack of interesting things to come up with by myself, I'll try out  urlLink Cheddar X .      Name 3 things you absolutely love:  Catching a quick nap on the couch when I know I should be doing something else. Mainly snuggled up under the green blanket when I really should just get up, brush my teeth and go to bed. It's all warm and comfy! Wow. that was just one thing. Second thing: My man smiling at me. Third thing: hanging out with friends after dark when it's still warm enough outside to wear a tank top and flip flops.    If you had to give 2 of them up which would they be (and why)?  Gotta go with the stolen naps and warm summer nights.    What is your all time favorite memory EVER?  It's not a momentous thing, but I always think about sitting on the quad at Davis with Mike. He's sort of on his side, absent-mindedly picking at the grass. It's nice outside, we just got out of class and have an hour to kill before the next one. We're not dating yet, but just chatting. I realize (finally) that he's an amazing boy and that I might like to date him.     What is the one thing that happened in high school that would make you avoid your class reunion? I suppose the drama from my junior prom. My ex-boyfriend set me up with a friend of his that was just a nervous weirdo. The following week anxiety boy accused me of trying to hook up with the ex all night. so obnoxious. but really, i actually liked high school. had a fun group of friends and got into just enough trouble to have a good night, not too much to ever really get caught.     What is your dream job, no matter how untrained you might be or unrealistic and bizarre it might be?  I've told people this before and they think I'm insane. I would want to be Rachel Ray from the Food Network. She has two shows: 30 Minute Meals and $40 a Day. She's just so freakin' happy all the time. Travels around the world eating food and singing karaoke with the locals.     What's one thing you think you're really good at?  I think I make a damn good batch of chocolate chip cookies. On a more serious side, I like to think that I'm a good, loyal friend.

      You've got to be kidding me. this world is going to come to a swift and painful conclusion.   I've been to Subway perhaps twice in the past month. And both of these auspicious outings have included a show of just how stupid the average American can be. In the first case, Mike and I are the only other people in the shop, waiting for a brash, middle-aged woman to order sandwiches for her and the three little league-clad boys (one of which thought it a good idea to add pepperoni to his tuna sandwich, but that's another story). After giving the meat and bread selections for the first order, the "sandwich artist" asks, "What size would you like? Six-inch or footlong?". This ridiculous lady counters with, "How big is a footlong?".   Seriously.   In almost any given situation, I like to be nice to strangers. I've been known to elbow my boyfriend when he swears in public, especially around children. But I couldn't contain myself. I laughed out loud. For a while. Luckily, the lady was so immersed in her decision-making process that she wasn't paying attention to me.   Anyway, that was a in early April. And I told the story to everyone. We all laughed at the stupidity of Americans. And then it happened again today!! Different Subway, different lady, but the same scenario.   Now, with a sample size of two, you can draw some conclusions. Do women lack the mathematical skills for such conversions? Are we too busy applying lip gloss and dreaming of shoes? I really don't know. All I can say is that I've never had a problem with it.

      goodness, I almost forgot.     Crazy Hair Girl: This girl looks to be about 17 and has this ridiculous blown out hair. She's super tiny so this hair looks like it occupys about fifty percent of her body. It doesn't help that she always looks confused...

      well, holy crap. the mail did in fact show up. About midday on Monday. A girl that i remember seeing on the fifth floor brought it down. She seemed very sweet and kept commenting on how nice our space was. I had the urge to chat with her—it would be nice to have a female "work" friend. I do all of my chatting with Scott who watches reality television and dates cute boys. Am I pining away for a friend upstairs? I must stop writing this down before it sounds like I'm stalking her. Just a passing thought.   Mike is STILL sick!! poor guy. this sinus infection just won't go away. he was able to sit in the Giants dugout last night with his new fangled press pass and he didn't even stay. that's how crappy he felt. In an effort to make his sickness better, I made chocolate chip cookies the lazy way. That is, i just spread it all into a 13x9" pan and cooked it. Much easier than doing 48 dollops that have to cook in three or four rounds. also, big giant cookie was a wonderful snack for breakfast!  In other totally uninteresting news, my fantasy baseball team sucks. I much preferred the random yahoo draft rather than the live draft we did this year. It's far too stressful and requires me to know stuff. It's really quite depressing to be the only girl playing and just sit in the cellar. It's like I'm just the insurance so that none of the boys will be last. I always think my team is so good and they're crap. boo.

      ridiculous. our mail is gone. it's disappeared. i go to our mailbox today and we have four items for the Fifth Floor, namely a People Magazine which i thought about keeping for my bus ride home tonight. So, i work my way up to the fifth floor in this freaky, old, 1915 building and find a door that opens. It opens into the post-dot.com boom sweatshop. Very nicely appointed, but it's like a typing pool with about 16 desks all in a common area with people just working away. No one really looked up when I entered and there didn't seem to be a reception area. I hand the mail to the only person that looked up and he didn't seem to know if they perhaps got our mail.   So, now I just went on a trek to ask the other building tenants if they might have our mischevious mail delivery for the day. I start at the sixth floor to work my way down. It appears to be an investment firm or something, the reception area is empty and the doors to the inner offices are all locked. I pace for a minute or two and then leave. As I'd already fitfully explored the fifth floor, I head for the fourth. Again, another set of unlabeled doors that I just randomly open. I find a receptionist that comes out of a dark conference room. I explain and she says that she hasn't checked yet; I ask her to call if she finds it. There might be one more company on the fourth floor, but I couldn't get to it from that section of the building.   Now, it is my task to call the Post Office. Like they'll be any help. I can't believe how much of my day is getting soaked up by one misguided postal worker.

      i realized i came to this page intended to write again about book club. it really isn't as nerdy as it sounds. Although i love that we come together to discuss literature, we also meet in between sessions to try out new bars in the city. it's good girly time and it's a nice to expand the network of friends.   with that disclaimer, i can ramble on about selecting the menu for my month. After being a GLOR member (that's Gorgeous Ladies of Reading [sometimes GLOD, d for drinking]) for nearly six months, it's my turn to host the monthly meeting. That means I got to present the three books for voting last month, it's held at my house, and the other girls bring the wine! The books I presented were  Middlesex  by Jeffrey Eugenidies,  Candy  by Mian Mian and  Tortilla Curtain  by T.C. Boyle. The girls voted for  Candy  by a landslide. And although it would be nice to create a theme for dinner from the book, I don't know what kind of dinner party works with weed and the dirty streets of Shanghai and Shenzen. So, I'm making my usual fare, something Italian!   Thankfully, I did some internet searching and found a spot on the Betty Crocker website that has dinner party menus. Strangely enough, my favorite is the  urlLink Pre-Prom dinner . Not that ten 25-28 year olds are going to prom. We're simply having food, a few drinks, some lit and some good girl bonding. In any case, I think I'm substituting my homemade foccacia for the Garlic Bread and probably going to skip the lasagne and just double the manicotti. Otherwise, it sounds pretty easy. I'll be able to make a lot of it the day before and really now I just have to decide between the lemon curd cheesecake or a key lime cheesecake. I suppose it really depends on if the craptastic Safeway by the house has key limes.   wow, that was a lot of typing for discussing a dinner menu.

      i've started my book club book too early and with ten days to go until our meeting, I only have 200 pages left. I read the first 75 in one day. so, in this hiatus from reading, i've been able to observe my surrounding on my daily bus pilgrimmages. a half an hour is a long time to try and not look at the person sitting directly across from you. i find that my neck gets sore from staring out the closest window.   i love that although i don't attempt to catch the same bus and—depending on whether i go to the gym or not i don't even get on at the same stop—i still see the same people. i realized today that i have come up with little names for them. this may not be interesting, but i'm going to try and list them all and see how many names i really have.    Poor Sinus Girl: She gets on at Masonic and always makes the worst snorking noises. it's not just a passing cold, i noticed it in November.    Smarmy Italian Guy: Gets on at Masonic also and his shoulder length, nice thick hair always looks like he put three gallons of gel in it. Saw him once on the way home instead and it must have dried out—hair looked gorgeous.   Unhappy Blond Lady: This girl gets on near Parker and could be very pretty but always has the most bitchy look on her face. Also, her boyfriend or someone calls every morning around 8th and Market streets. I also saw her in the gym once.    Dieting Woman: There's a woman that gets on before me that always has this big bag she carries with her. About half the time you can see her debating whether to get something out of the bag. She'll bust into a packet of rice cakes. No one debates about rice cakes unless they're on a sadistic diet.   Sweet Neighboor Lady: How could i forget! I see this woman and her son everywhere. Her son must be about four and she drops him off at school somewhere around Clayton. She gets off at the same downtown stop that i do. Her son is adorable—every time I see him he tells me his latest story about kung fu or how he was sick last week. I've run into them twice on the way to the grocery store and the other day I was reparking my car and saw them again. very cute.   Albino Girl: She gets on at Divis and has this short, curly, super-light blond hair. very pale girl, but always wears skirts and no nylons: proud of her paleness!   Very Short Lady: Although I haven't seen her lately, there used to be this super-short woman that was on the bus before me and gets off at Van Ness. Her feet don't touch the ground. Always smiling.   Gorgeous Hair Man: there's the nice man with mid-back length dreadlocks. He's so sweet and always offers his seat to women. Come to think of it, though, it's generally to cute, younger women. that's cool. can't say i blame the guy—it's a good way to strike up a conversation.   That's all i can think of at the moment. I'll add more later.

      erg. i've acquired this mean, nasty headache. and i'm whining about it because i'm usually a lucky girl who doesn't get them. Is this the world telling me not to be good and get up in the morning and work out? probably not.   it's a week now until heather packs up and goes on her 1,700 mile hike. i really have enjoyed having her in the house, but i'm also not unhappy to see her go. i've become so spoiled living with mike. we're so similar in the way that we handle money and daily trivialities that it's hard to adjust to something new. she never wants to watch the same movies we do and doesn't cook anything other than pasta. when i do eat with her, she—without fail—will mention that she wishes Joe were there. I know that she's just missing her boyfriend, but it really sounds like she'd rather od anything that have me at the dinner table. it's just so much easier to deal with a roommate when you sleep with them. not that i advocate shacking up with all your roommates, but i think living with a significant other is much better.    can i take that back? my significant other is now sick. again. the poor guy just got over his cold a few weeks ago. he really has been snuffly since we moved to the city. erg. i just wrote, "snuffly." it makes my 26 year old boyfriend sound like a toddler.

      lovely. 3:30pm rolls around and a email shows up from the boss man saying that we're all free to go home for the day. which really means that he was heading out, but i'll take what i can get. wonderful! i can head home and go to the gym and be a good little girl.   but, alas. since i am the queen of fed-exing i have to wait until all the packages are put together before i can leave. ridiculous. the main thing i'm waiting on has been waiting on a CD and printouts since 9:30am. how hard would it have been to get this done in the morning? i could be home!  boo.

      the only thing about an office of gay designers is that i often feel frumpy. i know they pay attention to brand name shoes and diesel jeans and all that. Every once in a while i get to work and realize that my pants are too short or i just feel like a nerd for some reason. it's not that any of my coworkers would ever say anything, but it almost makes me feel like i'm in junior high again. the past three years in the enviro agency world (and before that college) spoiled me. i was always the most well dressed person. mainly because everyone was over 50 and had pleated pants.   in any case, boo. i always wish that i had more confidence in myself. how does one acquire such a thing?

      ah, baseball, how i love you. went to my first game of the season last night. A's topped out over the Rangers 3-1. Mulder is just an incredible stud. The game ended at 2 hours and five minutes. It's so easy to go to games now. I can actually walk to Pac Bell Park from my office. For the Colliseum last night, I simply met Mike up the street at the BART station. Even catching the bus home last night at 10PM was a snap. gotta love it. Today is a $1 Hot Dog game, but it's at 12:35—and as much as I love baseball—I can't justify 6 hours of sick time for it. At least not yet.   there's nothing better than a hot dog, garlic fries and a souvenir beer. [i love that they don't specify what type of beer it is, just that it comes in a souvenir cup. found out later that it's MGD.]

      my goodness it's nice outside. if only we were going to the freakin' game tonight—ridiculous! oh well, pub quiz should be fun. I'll have to remind myself to watch the news tonight. it's always very helpful...they don't joke around for the Current Events category. The word "current" apparently means less than one hour old according to irish bars owners in the haight.  so, i was just reading over my posts, and i write about really boring shit. it's a problem with me. i really do worry about the fact that i don't ponder life questions. i don't have this inner drive propelling me to great heights. i don't know if i'm lazy or content or just simple. i've been given so many opportunities in this life. a stable and happy childhood, a loving grandmother that paid for my undergraduate schooling, an aptitude for learning, a fabulous group of friends [even as it grows and changes]. i am truly happy with what i've got, but what if i'm wasting it all?   it's funny. i've always excelled academically. i have good communication skills and get along very well with others, professionally and otherwise. yet, i'm happiest now answering phones. yes, it would be nice to have more to do during the day [thus, the blog]. but i truly enjoying being able to go home at a reasonable hour and not stress about work once i get there. i think that family and friends are important, not the brand of jeans i have. i think being happy with yourself is better than the prestigious title that requires an 80-hour work week. Of course, i would like to own my home home someday and i want to be able to put my kids [whenever they come along] through college should they choose to go. but, mike and i have been able to save approximately $30k in less than two years with our crappy jobs.    ah, life questions. i suppose the term inherently indicates that there are no simple answers.

      holy crap. so, apparently my zipper has been down all morning. yep, folks, that's three hours of me running around with my fly undone! Thankfully, they're nice, flowy black slacks with a wide waistband. I checked once I finally figured it out and you really can't see anything wrong with it. The only times I was sitting down it would have been either covered by my desk or by the coat I wore on the way in to work.   gotta love a monday morning.

      I can't even entertain myself with playing games on my computer. I have this poker game for OS X (none of the Yahoo games seem to work for me). And it just frustrates the shit out of me. I'm apparently very bad at poker. thank goodness its not even close to real money because I keep having to buy more chips. it's really very sad.   what's even more sad is that i've looked on the internet for poker playing tips, but I haven't really found any. then i thought about buying a book, because there's lots of those. i'm not sure i would want to read it though. i would feel like a terrible dork. it's this social game that takes skill and logic and i'm such a nerd that i try and learn it from a book.   perhaps the answer is just to stop playing around at work.

      ah, the lovely tense feeling when the boss is back in the office. a boss who claims that he had me make travel reservations for a different day. 'cause i would just write down the wrong day in my little notebook here. either way, one of us just cost the company about five hundred dollars (that the difference in fare). But, he's such a weirdo and will ONLY fly on united, for the miles. The fare is $1236 on United, but $443 on America West.   It was much nicer this past week when he wasn't around. I was super busy, but not stressed about it. erg.

      woo-ha, it's crazy around here! Lots of deadlines and people running around. Pam actually pulled an all-nighter last night. Who—past the age of 20—does that? She has actually been working since 8am yesterday. holy crap. but, i'm enjoying having the fun, team camraderie vibe while still being able to go home at 5:30 and enjoy myself.   Our ratio of mostly gay men in the office has shifted dramatically. We've got three female freelancers in to spice it up. That's now 7 men to 7 women. Plus, three of our boys are gone today. craziness.

      ah, poptarts. one of the foods I crave as an adult now. I never had them when I was little and now they just seem like a treasure. I keep finding things, mainly foods, that other friends had all the time and i have never even tasted until now. and i'm addicted.
