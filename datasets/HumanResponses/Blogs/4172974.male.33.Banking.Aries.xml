      I signed up for the RoadRunner Premium service getting high 4s - Mid 5 Down load times now and a 480 upload stream. (mostly staying around the 4.7 range... Going to ride the rest of this month out to see if the extra bandwidth is going to be worth the extra $

      Have not been online for the past week due to some Systems Know it all that came out on Monday and messed this whole side of the subdivision up... 5 hours lost work and 4 "forced visits" from Time Warner they still don't know what is going on. Can you believe that one of the techs actually went out and KICKED the cable box as part of the service? Anyways got a full plate have not been playing anything due to lack of internet and me accidentally placing my Doom 3 play disk in one of the hundreds of cd cases that I have.  Anyways will write more when I have the time and HOPEFULLY my internet will be up as well.

      Well due to doing the 'home-owners' stuff, and currently ripping my entire cd collection I have not had a chance to get into the gaming scene today. And I kinda blew off my best friend that lives in Ohio cause I was suppose to jump on and play some UO with him and I really wanted to try and find the 'soul cube' in Doom 3 not to mention I wanted to work on my Second Life club haven't had an event in a week due to work and Doom 3 coming out, and hell I have not even logged in to let anyone know why I am not in the game.  Second Life: Got plans for the Second Life club it is my goal to get from nothing to to top 10% of the game. It will be riddled with obstacles as I am totally dependant on other people. I am not a scripter and although I do know Photoshop I don't know jack about "designing anything" I tried to put a pic of my wife on a tee shirt and I made it look like something resembling a fun house mirror. But I do plan on learning how to script now (great another something to add to my already over ladened list of things to do. Got to work up a way to get people to 'dwell' for extended periods of time that is not going to 'counter productive' and break me of all of my linden. The weekly bonus so far does not constitute the funds that I exert when I have no other form of making money.... Got to put my mind to work here..............  Lineage 2: Have not logged into in over a week :(  Everquest: Have not logged into it in over a month ACK! looks like I am going to dump it its 13 - 15 down the hole every month :(  stopped enjoying the game a while back, I have NO idea why I ever resubscribed  H0rizons: thought I canceled the accont but was hit with a 3 month sub fee Friday, Made sure I canceled it now.... Although I love my dragon I just don't see the need the servers are mostly empty and you can't really do anything .... shame that game had good potential but as usual CS and lack of following through flushed it down the toilet.   UO: Im still pisst off from porting into the middle of the bone knight room and losing all of my stuff.   I can't believe that I was that careless but oh well you live and you learn :(  Doom 3: Got to get the soul cube GOT TO DO IT. I got the BFG today before I quit for the day. Didnt get a chance to fire it off, not even a test fire round :( ... Would of loved to have it when I was fighting those 3 ogres with rocket launchers for arms.. Thank Got they did not have that "great" of an IQ (gotta love dumb AI) but what the hell am I talking about still took me 5 -6 times before I finally killed them all.  Well that is in for now it is late I need to get some sleep got to pull a 10 hour day tomorrow :( ... DAMN someone send me the winning lottery numbers quick!!!!!

      I have been utterly hooked on Doom 3 since Thursday I have not even logged on to any other games. This game is utterly awesome! The graphics are incredible. I must admit in the beginning I was totally immersed in the game that when some of the demons presented themselves I kinda jumped. I have no idea how far I am in the game I am in the Delta Labs and just was put through the 'teleporter' and the graphics for the teleporter was weird to say the least resemembled most "worm hole graphics" but looked like you were traveling through a bloody bodily tube.. ummm yuck but cool!

      Well I have not been online very much since Monday when some genius Line tech came out and screwed this whole side of the subdivision up. I had to leave work 2 days to come back home and listen to a tech tell me that there is nothing wrong it has been a nightmare.... But on the upside I did decide to sign up for the Road Runner Premium service and now am averaging 4.7 downloads and 480 up which is not bad hope it gets faster so I can justify the extra $  Well, dumbass me forgot my mothers 50th Birthday yesterday DOH! and my dad decided to call and give me yet another piece of his mind today. In his eyes either I don't care about them, think only of myself, put our dogs in front of them, lazy, and new today horrible at time management. So I'm the bad son now that never goes and visits or never calls. (I do call but when I do call all I do is get bitched at cause I haven't come down to visit) ...... and of course when I do come down and visit it I get gripped at cause we don't stay longer than we do. So it is a no win situation for me, we got into it pretty good today, enough to ignite my wife and that was not fun trying to calm her down (she would defend you to her death as my boss put it, right or wrong)...... Now it has been some time since I have went to my parents house 8 months actually and they have come up a few times during those months. True I do live 3 hours away and should make time but I just dont have it right now! BUT YES I WAS AN ASS for not remembering my mother's birthday that I can't excuse :(  Got my brother phone mailed off finally via fed ex. He's been waiting on it for 2 months.... Ok maybe I do suck at time management....   My window box is still NOT fixed the replaced only parts of the box and the hardi plank does NOT match up and there it is riddled with nail holes, I am about fed up with it and about to tell them to just paint it and get out. I have never seen someone exert as much man power and time to try and take a short cut to fixing a problem just to make it worse. If they had rebuilt the box like it was suppose to then there would be no problem and it would be done but noooooo 3 trips from the framers and painters later it still looks like crap :(----------------- Ok who ever said that owning a home was better than a condo........ grrrrr  Damn I sound like I am angry all the time.. :( not the case just had a bad luck with cable/home builders/ and my folks.. but anyways my dogs love me :P  Been looking for a place to host a web site thought I found a really good one at ixwebhosting but they have a zero adult content clause in their TOS.. meaning that someone could not post a picture of a night at Mardi Gras ..... I am not into the whole porn scene but hey I also don't want someone that is hosting my site to be picking my site apart if I or someone else posts anything the would violate their TOS.... a shamed too cause I really did like what I had heard/read about them.... but I really dont have time to get a web site up and running atm. So maybe it was a good thing. Anyone got any ideas for a good hosting site?  Work is work nothing has changed I still hate it, but hey it pays the bills right?.... right  But that's all for now,  Me   this is my life as boring as it may be

      Well today I have spent most of my day ripping CD's to my computer (I have way too many cds!) I am currently debating whether or not to get an iPod. However with this many cd's the dilemma is to fork out the $399 + to get the iPod that holds 40gigs of music. I am in process of burning approx. 200-300 (didn't think I had that many) cd's that I have accumulated and I end up not listening to many of them due to the fact it is time consuming (ok I think I sound lazy here) to dig the cd out of its case and put in into my carry cd case (that I used in the car and in the stereo). So what to do? Still debating... Guess I will see how much disk space I use on my computer and go from there. My wife is concerned that the iPod will be intriguing to me in the beginning then will fall to the way side like the $1000 camera that I bought and have not used in a long time due to it being 'bulky'  Well I had 50 of my cd's ripped at a 'very high quality' rate 198kbs and found out they were using 2 - 3 kb more per song so I changed the settings and am re ripping them ARRRRRGGGHHH. I could not tell the difference between the 2 settings using the computer, home stereo and headphones so I decided to rerip the cds.  Been ripping and playing doom all day long. I still need to cut the back yard and see if the 'yard kids' are coming to do the front yard, hopes and prays they are or I will have to cut the front yard, which is not a good thing. I also need to bbq some ribs too, as well as clean out the garage, cut a flowerbed in the front yard, clean my office, clean and chemical the pool, medicate the dog without getting hurt ..lol, TOOO much to do with not a lot of time to do it..... story of my life lol  Signing off for now!   EDIT: 3:20pm  Jeeez im never going to get all this done. Got the 60th cd ripping now, BBQ started (ribs and chicken), back yard not mowed, yard kids not here ACK, garage not cleaned..... andthe days running out ACK oh I did do the swimming pool with out turning the water green, blue or red and no smoke either lol ... dog got ear meds (all I got was a busted lip--- you got to understand my dog is 15 months old and weighs 125 - 130lbs Great Pyrnees and he does not like the meds in the ear thing) Oh well will up date later  EDIT: 11:17pm  What a day been doing lots of stuff but does not seem like I got anything accomplished at all. still got over 1/2 of my cd's to rip got most of the other stuff done as well and now cause of work and still ripping not going to get to "Doom 3" it :( Gotta get sleep for work.. Well that was today Sunday August 8, 2004

      Hello world and welcome to my BLOG (what a name huh?). I consider this a journal of sorts and I have attempted to do this many many times in my life and either ended up losing interest due to a lack of time or just plain a lack of time.  In these pages I will without hesitation post my day to day activities as well give you a glimpse into my past. Although only 33 years old I fell I have done more in my life than some will do in a life time, albeit not all what one would consider the "norm"  Well enough blabbering lets get on with it. I will describe myself in my profile for the blog.  ****
