      Hey everyone.  These online forums are a lot more fun when you actually know the people you are talking to.  Anyway, just running around the internet and wanted to say hi.  Michelle

      Can you all believe this nice weather!!! I've lived my whole life in Iowa waiting for a summer where i didn't sweat to beat the band every day!!  Jay, I had heard about Nathan. I talked to him sometime in June and he had just gotten back from throwing at Wrigley for a bunch of MLB scouts.  Rebecca, as far as reading goes, I try to stay within the bounds of material that has glossy pages, magagzines, newspaper coupon sections, wall calenders and the like.  anyway. I need to go now and do something outside!!! It will be kinda hard. my boss doesn't like it when I go outside and play.  later, r knox

      Do you guys remember Nathan Johnson from high school? He is a year younger than us. Anyway he was drafted and signed by the Philadelphia Phillies baseball organization this year! He was picked 21st in the 20th round, number 602 overall. He is currently playing for the  urlLink Batavia Muckdogs   minor league team! I can proudly say that I played on the high school team with him for one year!!  Here are some related links:  - his  urlLink profile  from the University of Iowa  - an  urlLink article  and listing of the Big Ten players drafted this year.  - the Phillies'  urlLink draft listing   - the  urlLink Muckdogs' roster  - click on Nate's name, and you can see his picture in his Muckdogs uniform!  Anyway, I think it's pretty cool, knowing someone who got drafted - we'll have to see if he makes it to the big show!

      yeah to jay for being the "techie" of the group and setting up this little online party.  i have to say i was glad that so many of you shared my feelings on the reunion...i didn't want to go, but i felt kind of guilty about it, but now that i know not too many of you are going (i.e. only jay) i don't feel so bad.  and, jay, that's not a personal slam...i feel quite confident that i will see you soon outside of the atmosphere of crappy high school acquaintances.  ok i think that's it for now...until i think of something a little more interesting to talk about...i'm just trying to avoid studying for my LAST FINAL EVER at the moment (but let's be serious, i'll probably end up back in school someday anyway).  later rebecca  ps. anyone read "ethan frome"?  i'm into classics lately and finally read something i like!  it's a miracle!

      Ok, well there's a start. Now, let's see what we can make of this thing!  By the way, I feel like I should probably give a disclaimer: If anyone objects to my posting their email address or their comments from the recent mass e-mailings, please let me know and I shall remove it promptly! (If you don't know what I'm talking about, see the two posts below, especially the comment posts.)

      From: "Anne Selene"   To: see below Subject: Reunion anyone?? Date: Wed, 21 Jul 2004 21:09:54 -0500   Hello ladies and gents!  I am assuming that everyone has heard about the upcoming Oskaloosa Senior High School Class of 1999 reunion by now. (If not, let me know and I'll forward you the email) I was just wondering what everyone was thinking about doing...going, not going, having their own reunion, moving to Denmark, etc. I think it would be a lot of fun to see some people I haven't seen for a while (and probably won't see for a while) again, but if none of you are going to be there...well, that kind of blows that idea! And if you're now living out of state, that's no excuse; I don't live in Iowa anymore either! Ok, ok, North Carolina might be a little far. But anyway, I just wanted to throw an email out there and see who was interested at all in attending the reunion. In any case, feel free to email me and/or the whole email list about what's going on with you and your undoubtedly fabulous life :-) I hope everyone is doing well!  Take care,  Anne aeselene@msn.com

       Welcome!  Of course, contrary to the title of this post, this is not by any means the beginning of this group of people. It is more of a new frontier to allow us to keep in touch, on a group scale, and continue our friendships!  This will provide a central point for everyone to share memories, news, thoughts, questions, answers...anything you want to make available to the group! What's even better, is there are multiple formats you can post in, and multiple ways in which to post them! I won't take the time to explain it all here - I know that you are all smart enough to play around and figure it out, but here's a quick snapshot - you can post text, images, links, even audio; you can do these by way of this site, directly from the web, email, and even by phone!  So, I hope that at least some of you find this interesting, and that it becomes interesting and useful. If not, well, that's ok - at least I tried!  Let me know if you have any comments, suggestions, or questions!  ~Jay  urlLink mailto:jaycollman@gmail.com
