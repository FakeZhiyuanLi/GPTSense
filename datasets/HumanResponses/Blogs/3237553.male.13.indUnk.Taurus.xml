      Woohoo. There is loads to write today.   PIE @ NAN HUA   Today, we do not sell out much of our stuffs. Sigh. That is due to the products that we sell. Do ya know wat we sold? NOTEBOOKS!!! Who would buy them? We earned about less that $15 today. Business is bad. -.- Mr. Foo came by our store just now. He didn't give a hoot about it. He only payed attention to hot-selling stores like 1/6, 1/2 and 1/3.   Playstation 3 News   Hehe... Actually i got nothing much to write. My blog looks empty. So, i decided to write things that i like to fill up the spaces.   Playstation 3 supported by Foxconn  According to the Taiwan Economic News on 6 July 2002, the Taiwanese electronics giant Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd. (FoxConn) is aiming at joint development with Sony for the Playstation 3 console. Foxconn president Terry Guo announced that Foxconn, which is the largest privately held company in Taiwan for its turnover, has formed a Research & Development team for PlayStation 3 with Sony. [Taipei, July 6 2002]      PS3 console to be released in 2005  Japanese media reported on May 6th that the PS3 console is in development. The goal is to make new processor technology, called "grid" about 200x faster than current console technology. This is almost achieving their original goal of making the PS3 1000(!) times faster than the PS2. This goal was publically set by Mr Okamoto, the Senior VP and Chief Technical Officer of Sony Computer Entertainment, at the 2002 Game Developers Conference in San Jose, California.     The Cell - Power for Playstation 3 and ...more!   The heart of the Playstation3 will be a new chip (or rather chip set) developed by Sony, Toshiba, and IBM. The companies will collectively invest more than $400 million in the next five years to design a "supercomputer-on-a-chip" for the PS3. The name for this technology is "grid" (formerly called "cell") and appears to be targeted squarely at the possibilities of parallel and distributed computing over the internet. Grid computing is a variation of distributed computing, and presumably involves networked game machines sharing software, processing power and data. Okamoto also said that networking applications including downloadable software would be integral to Sony's Playstation3 console. A recent report (May 5 2002) from the Japanese News Agency Kyodo said that the Playstation 3 would work over superfast fiber optics connections and would be Sony's first console to run games without a digital video disc. Sony also is considering offering the new chip to other companies for use in televisions and electronics equipment, Kyodo said.     Excerpt from an IBM press release:   Code-named "Cell," the new microchips will employ the world's most advanced research technologies and chip-making techniques, including copper wires, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) transistors and low-K dielectric insulation, with features smaller than 0.10 microns -- 1,000 times thinner than a human hair. The result will be consumer devices that are more powerful than IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer, operate at low power and access the broadband Internet at ultra high speeds. Cell will be designed to deliver "teraflops" of processing power.     Present memory not fast enough for Playstation3   Kenshi Manabe, senior vice president of Sony Computer Entertainment Semiconductor division, said the Playstation3 will need memory with incredibly high speed and tens-of-gigahertz bandwidth. "I'm not sure that even what we have seen for DDR-II on the present (industry) memory roadmaps will be high enough performance for us."    "It's graphics, Jim... but not as we know it"  Richard Doherty, an analyst for Envisioneering, Seaford, N.Y., said that PS3 will not have a graphics engine as we know it. Instead, the Cell's architecture is likely to replace the traditional game console graphics processor model on which the Xbox and Gamecube are based, that use NVidia and ATI GPUs, respectively. The Playstation 3, as well as other applications that will use the Cell, will take advantage of the CPU's "self healing" capability. "Self-healing computers will be programmed not to go down," Doherty said. "Bus and processor areas are automatically corrected using a new meshed era redundancy technology." The Cell's compression engine, for example, will use a multi-processor engine to reconstruct missing pixels or other missing features due to glitches in a streaming PS3 game or video.     Sony's vision: PS3 as the all-encompassing home system?  If Sony's aspirations succeed, then the Playstation 3 will not be a pure video game console, but rather measure the amount of milk left in the fridge, record TV programs to hard-disk, automatically download new software, perform Tera-flop operations and a variety of other things. In short, if one can automate, computerize, network or electrify a process, then the PS3 should be able to take on the task.    "Playstation 3 Diet", anyone?  Today, a system like this sounds futuristic. A super-console, replacing TV, computer, game console and complete home electronics system in one wont be cheap. Rumors are making rounds that the PS3 will be sold in two versions, one that is the do-all Playstation 3 version with all the bells and whistles (perhaps including laying golden eggs as well?) and one that is, yikes(!), just a pure video game console.   Either way, the Playstation3 is still long away, and it may well be possible that the "super-do-it-all" version is eventually marketed under a different name. May we suggest Superstation? Or... Homestation? Here at psreporter.com, while not technophobic or fearing the future, we would feel more comfortable with a PS3 that does only one thing, but very well... to provide us with great video game experiences.   Â©2002 psreporter.com, The Playstation Reporter    News for Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Movie   Source: FF7AC Reunion    Dengeki Playstation:  Sephiroth mentioned "the Reunion" during the game, and now Kadaj says the same before the crowd at the shell house. Yazoo puts himself down, questioning whether they will be welcomed in "big brother's" town, as if realizing that they will not.  As for Cloud's relationship with Tifa. After Aeris' death, Tifa played a supportive role. The battles deepened their mutual bond, but they presently live apart. Perhaps visions/illusions of Aeris still live in their hearts. There is a reason the silver-haired youths fight Tifa. Is their goal related to a former battle?  Jenova might still be alive on the Planet even though she should have disappeared with Sephiroth. Each of the Jenova cells has a mind of each own and will reunite where the head is (The Reunion).  Present condition of the Turks: The Turks were a division of ShinRa, however, following the latter's downfall, they have in fact also disappeared. Furthermore, their direct superior, Rufus, is already lost. Many of the members are deceased. Reno and Rude seem to be the ones uniting the organisation, as usual.  According to the latest statement from Nomura, the movie is about 50% complete. The storyline is completed and voice recording for the scenarios are drawing to an end. They are now finally seeing the results of their production work. All voice actors have already been decided upon, and the voice actors used in the trailer with FFX-2: International are the actual voice actors. Also, it is indeed Marlene that introduced the TGS trailer. When asked whether Japanese and English voice-recording are being done simultaneously, Nomura states that English voice-recording has not yet begun.  There is definitely a relationship between Sephiroth and the silver-haired youths, given their similar hair and eye colour.  Dengeki: Will Cid and Red XIII be in the movie? Nomura: At present they have not been announced, but you will find it strange if they are not...  Advent Children is suitable to be played on the PSP as the screen is relatively large and the resolution is very high.  Dengeki: Roughly when will Advent Children be on sale? Nomura: We will be sure to put it out by winter. (laughs)    Famitsu PS2:  Before Crisis is 40% completed, and beta edition tests will begin in August. Fee is yet undecided. Producer: Yukimasa Ito (manager/producer with Square Enix's Handheld department) Co Producer: Yoshinori Kitase Concept and Character Design: Tetsuya Nomura Scenario Writer: Kazushige Nojima (now working for another company)  The title, which refers to the crisis of the Planet, was selected by Ito, Nomura and Nojima. The events will occur prior to the original Final Fantasy VII, and will have nothing to do with the plot of Advent Children.  The logo shows two new character designs by Nomura, the man in the logo holds a rod, while the woman holds a gun. Players will control these two characters in the game. The Turks have always been very popular among the fans and are now the protagonists. Some other secondary characters will also appear, such as Reno and Tseng of the Turks, as well as perhaps Barret or Tifa.  When asked whether Before Crisis or Advent Children will be released first, Ito laughs, saying that the timeline of Before Crisis is chronologically placed prior to the events of Advent Children. Thus, it can be inferred that Before Crisis will launch ahead of Advent Children. The handheld action RPG will appear in September on the FOMA NTT DoCoMo (900i-series).  Regarding the Advent Children logo/artworks, Yasuke Naora (Art Director) states that, as with FFVII, they leave room for interpretation. For example, the front wheel of Cloud's motorcycle, the silhouette of a certain person, the relative sequence of Jenova cells, etc... The design of putting the logo inbetween two people standing came to Nomura when Ito showed him the logo design and talked about the base arrangement (of cells). The CG concept from the poster suggests 'rebirth' and 'omen'.

      Sigh...   I'm so bored. Nothing to do at home except downloading Shaman King. The file size is 13.3GB ya know? So big.   Ok. Today, i gonna write the definitions of "mako" Wat is "mako"? Well, mako is the essence of the planet. Reactors are made to suck them from the planet itself as mako can generate electricity and other forms of powerful energies. Small amounts of mako can generate electricity more than nuclear. It is also safer, since mako dun explode. The bad thing is that if one falls into mako, he/she will get mako poisoning and loses all his/her memory. It's a bad thing eh? That's the end of it.  P.S.:  Mako doesn't exist.   falling...

But luckily, i got ticks for interesting concepts. Wahaha! I used colour pencil only. :)   Shinra   Yes! Now, 5 mako reactors are starting to function. This is good. :) If you dunno where the reactors are, look at the bottom-left corner of my blog. Enjoy!  I think u guys dunno wat is "mako". Well, i am too lazy to type the definitions of it. -.- Gotta go now.  Bye!   signing off...

      It's done. My design. But i will add more thing later on. Not now. I did my chinese and english paper 1 today. Basically, they are quite easy to do. Just pay attention in class and u won't fail. That is wat i did. Anyway, Kah swee forgot to bring his chinese dictionary today. I feel so sorry for him. But he only has himself to blame, as it is heavy and he is lazy to bring it. So the moral of this story is.....umm.... Aha! "Laziness is bad."

      Hmm... I saw my line dancing teacher who taught me before yesterday. She waved at me but i couldn't wave back as i was carrying two heavy grocery bags for my mother. :)   Thinking of the past   Just now i was thinking about things and stuff that i did in my former primary school. I remembered that the whole of P6 have to go to the hall and "dance". This is so as to select some pupils for a performance at the school's offical opening day. I purposely tried to dance very badly, so that i will fall out of the selection. But some of my friends are judges and sabotaged me by telling the teacher that i was good at it. Then, i got in. At that time, i hated it. Now, come to thnk of it, it is actually a blessing in disguise. If my friends hadn't put me in, I wouldn't have got to know friends like Valentina, Vivian, Sarah and gotten a better understanding of my other very good friends that also got selected such as Shengda, Sean, Brandon and Xian Wen.  The practice was quite unfair actually, since my classmates can hold a party and play while I practise in the dance room. Sigh...  As time goes by, i began to have a crush on val. Then i got her number from Vivian and we started SMSing each other. It was unbelievable but we sent about an average of 80 to 100 sms to each other each day. From this, i began to understand her and things like dat. During these days, time passed very quickly. This proved a theory of someone famous. That famous guy said before, "When you touch a hot pan, a second seems like an minute. When you chat with a hot chick, an hour seems like a minute."  How true.  So, things ended quickly and in a blink of the eye, we are already going to collect our PSLE results. Amazingly, Vivian got a high score of 275. Beat that! I got 242 and Val got 249, won me by 7 marks. Incredible. When it comes to the choosing to secondary schools, val wanted to go to bukit panjang government high but her mother forbid that as there is normal stream there and she feared val will be affected by them. So, she goes Nan Hua. It is good since it is a SAP school as well as the fact that there are no normal students in it.   For me, i wanted to go commonwealth to join my other good friends who went there but went to Nan Hua instead since go there will have a higher chance to wooing Val. Until now, I haven't taken any actions yet. I need to settle down my results 1st, meaning that it should have mostly As and Bs and no Cs. Who knows? Perhaps when I'm in Sec 3 I may take some actions. For now, it is just a fantasy... -.-   I fell into darkness and couldn't see the light. But i will find it, for her sake...
