      There is something about the sweet smell of rain in the summer.    Alhamdo lillah (Thank the Lord), we have had great rain in Dallas past month or so and it feels so good compared to many of the hot summer days we normally have here.  It makes my air conditioning in my office work a lot better :)  And many days it rains part of the day and becomes sunny rest of the day to reveal a very moderate temperature for the rest of the day, like yesterday.  Went jogging in evening and it was like in the mid 70s my gawd it was great!    But we may pay for it in August!!!  Oh well, I'll take it when I can get it!  No tubing yet, no vacation yet, nothing happening on that front...just normal stuff happening....-Mustafa

      So, the other day, someone at dinner asks me if I had seen this particular commercial.  Like, I have no idea what he is talking about.  Why?  Well, I have basically stopped watching live television.  I PVR it and watch later...meaning that I skip the commercials...push the forward button a few times and poof commercials all gone!  It has gotten so that even if I am right there at the time the show starts, I prefer to just wait about 5 minutes so I can have 5 minutes of buffer to forward...  What is really freaky (man I mean freaky) is sometimes I will be listening to the radio or even watching a movie and I want to reach for the forward button!!!  I am wondering what the heck is this I am listening/watching to?!?  Awright I am out. -Mustafa

      OK, so now are they coming out with low carb potatoes or something?  Everywhere you go, everyone you meet is on some sort of low carb eating regimen aw my gawd what is going on?  I am personally always fighting food demons and weight demons so I know about trying to lose weight etc, and for fun one time I did Atkins for 2 weeks and lost some awesome weight.   And then I ate some pizza and gained it all back! :)  So now I am sticking with tried and true - salads, exercise, and some painful late night choices like herbal tea instead of that gallon of Haagen Daz.    But can you imagine the money being made from all this?  I remember the high carb diets a few years ago and the high carb bars everyone had in their pockets.  Man, that is the kiss of death now!   OK, it's Saturday again, weekend again, wow, time flies. -Mustafa

      Hey, very exciting thing has already happened today - a friend of mine sent me a Gmail invitation so now I have a gmail account!  So I clicked on the link like right when he sends it to me and signed up.  I am gmailing!  Gmail is Google's new email and they give you 1 GB of mail (yes not a typo!) -  I plan on using it uh...a lot.    My office's air conditioner is not working well and after days and days of calling someone will be here today (supposedly) to fix it or at least look at it.  Let me tell u, in Dallas in summer, no A/C is a serious issue!  A Garage Sale is a distinct possibility this weekend.  Next weekend is booked and the weekend after may be booked also.  Where is this summer going?

      So I had to go all the way to Fry's Electronics today just to pick up one small SCSI adapter.  Do you get the feeling that they think you should feel privileged to be shopping there?   I don't know, the attitude their by their sales staff, checkers, etc. is so irritating.  Sigh....  And whats with the military tribunal at the exit?  Put some tags on the items do whatever you have to, but can we please stop the full body scans at the exit?  Just let me get to my car please.....  OK, whining off.  I will start slowly writing about some issues important to me soon, keep tuning in....well tune in... :)  awright, mustafa out.

      OK, so here is the deal,   We have a DishNetwork satellite system and we have a DishNetwork PVR (a digital recorder) so we can record channels.  So my wife and I have this issue because we generally both want to record shows on during prime time like between 7pm and 9 pm.  So we have to fight each other over who gets to record what.    Do I need to get a separate PVR for each one of us?

      OK, the week has started, and today promises to be...uh....very exciting.  I sold a couple of things on ebay and I had to figure out how to package it using FedEx cause the buyer wanted me to use his FedEx account number.  Well, that took me like an hour to figure out...well, morning is killed.   I need to re-arrange the frames in my office.  That will kill the afternoon.  Let's call that a day.   -Mustafa

      OK, so deciding what to do today...  The garage needs cleaning...the computer room needs cleaning...but I think we will....  GO TO SIX FLAGS!  Yeah, should be fun....but how long will the lines be?  How hot will it be?  Have to go to a function in evening....will we be back in time?  These are the burning questions of my life. -Mustafa

      Well, it's Saturday, weekend!  Kids have exams today (don't ask!) - so now I am wondering what to do this weekend - I got these new swim pant/shorts so I want to try them out - I HAVE to go swimming this weekend!    OK, maybe plan a trip to the Lake on Sunday.  Today seems like a cleaning day.  Boy, could it get any more exciting?

      OK, so we had to go to Houston for a wedding this past weekend.    That was the most socializing I have done in a while.  I think I need to get out more!  Mixing and making small talk - not two of my strongest attributes.    All in all it was fun, mixing momineen and others is interesting to watch cause we I think don't socialize enough with others and live in this microcosm of a universe that sometimes limits our "zehen" (minds).    We drove back late late at night cause we couldn't wait to get back to home sweet home!  But boy did we eat!  The whole weekend, I think I gained like 3 pounds in 3 days!

      OK, so yesterday was opening and day and we managed to get tickets and we arrived, uh, a bit early for the show to get good seats.  Suffice it to say, we were the first ones in line.  By a long shot.  Man, I felt so nerdy!  OK the movie:   The action sequeneces were breathtaking.  Very well done, well photographed, great special effects.    But in between the action, there was pulling teeth painful times of emotional blah blah blah and spidey crying and the girl crying and the grandma crying and the friend crying aw my gawd - GET OVER IT - and start the action up!    And the girl in the movie (Kirsten Dunst) - oh my gawd - has someone heard of make-up???  She looked horrible the whole movie and was painful to watch.  And oh yeah she was crying too.  I felt the director was trying to be too artsy and too cute with all the background and motivation and blah blah blah.    Another point - when spidey was flying around - it looked very cartoonish - the CGI has gotten really carried away so much so that it is hard to differentiate reality and cartoons and it all looks like cartoons...for example the helicopters in the closing sequence...straight out of toy story or shrek.
