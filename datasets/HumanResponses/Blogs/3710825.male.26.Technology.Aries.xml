      Some times a person is so confused that he doesnot know what is he doing here in this world..he just lives the moment and doesnot plan anything....I do a lot of such stupid things in my life... and that make life so much packed that some times i feel that i do not have time for myself..why am i living like a fool and again i do not have time to sort this out....        I remember when i was in school I had the best of the friends one can have and there used to be a great joy or some good feeling when we used to sit together in the play time and during lunch time etc etc.... then as I grew i still have friends but its kind of different probably i need to feel good for all my real professional friends but i kind of like the people who consider me their yar and take me for granted....any way i can change myself thus i too am bit professional( i donot know if this word suits here) when it comes to friendship...keep it simple....But then you miss that kind of a friend who is really reliable and the one who you can go anytime when you have a problem... but then i guess its time to live yourself that's to solve your own problems and have a peacefull life....

      Some times when i wake up i think that....yes today is my day and hence forth all those lazy habits must be a long forgotten dream and for the next five minutes i lie there planning my whole future.... well then after 5 min everything is gone and then the evil part takes control over the great brain... and after a while you feel that you are gone too deep and the shore looks like a distant dream...this is the flip side of the story...  Why.. why... why... why... why... i keep reading this everywhere and its keep hitting in my head all the while but then what the... whatâ€™s life with out all these hangama..       Life's been on a marathon and as the day passes its like we need to run faster and faster or the world would leave you behind...Gosh and this rat race has made gone from wild to crazy...and when it comes to some thing no one has time.. Well then i guess that's life... life is sooo.....
