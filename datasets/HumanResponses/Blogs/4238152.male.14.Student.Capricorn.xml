      Musings At Anderson By: Nofing  Of late, I’ve come to notice how seriously the school values their student’s opinions. This is especially so for the less positive, less pleasant and well, cruder remarks. Not that I’ve failed to notice over my past three years at Anderson but what Mr. Ang mentioned just recently made me sit up and wonder what really is their problem or our problem? In school, there are only two sorts of bright sparks – those at 3/7 and those at 3/1. Those in between are just  in – betweens . See, those at 3/7 are nice, respectable students who do their work and keep to themselves. Those at the other side of the rainbow however, are a darker shade of  black . They are bright no doubt and self – opinioned. They are the people PM Lee wants (don’t wait to be invited to tea instead take the…). Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for our brethren Dr. Chee Soon Juan. Ironically the situation is also the same at Anderson. However, the issue Mr. Ang raised was of similar nature. A secondary 2 student had been voicing his strong opinions on his online blog. Not that I am praising him but certainly there must be room for creativity and self – reflection? Of course, the nature and content of his online entries must be taken into consideration. To what extent was it crude and slanderous, which at the same time is very unbecoming of Andersonians. Certainly voicing out one’s feelings isn’t wrong or else esteemed writers like Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Brown would have been taken to task? However, cracking blue jokes and touching on controversial issues like what an extremely unwise Sheikh Haikel did would get you into unwanted trouble. As much as I wish to contend with the fact that airing one’s opinions is perfectly fine as long as one toes the line, it is disappointing to note that Mr. Ang also found usage of vulgarities and dialects of unprintable nature hard to swallow. I am one would enjoys the beauty of languages. The less refined bits are part and parcel of it not that it is encouraged but like the finer points of any language, it allows for better expression. I feel that instead of condemning these words and phrases alike, we must learn to accept them and realize that at times, it is that special word that bridges the gap. Of course, Mr. Ang’s cause for concern is understandable. Singaporeans are a refined lot like their British counter – parts where the f word is used without so much as a bat of the eyelid. Dialects are an art. They represent our forefather’s culture. Their way of life, which at that time was tough – going, and their manner of speech was likewise influenced. Many a time, I find it strange that people take pleasure in back – biting others. I do not stand for that. Instead, we must take pride in our words and actions. Others should not determine our lives; neither should someone else dictate our words and actions. We live in a society of freedom of speech where as far as I’m concerned is as fair as doing a “Chee”. I find it all contradictory – indeed there is allowance for freedom of speech but like the “Chee” incident, but like the governments stand on cults, it is fine as long as it does not put the country’s welfare/interest/… at risk. When I say taking pleasure in back – biting others, I am of course referring to Anderson’s latest case of defamatory remarks. Obviously, the culprit must have heard of Eric’s misdemeanors. The sad thing is, this guy hid behind a mask. By posting his comments online, he has placed fellow writer Eric and myself in bad light. Indeed we have committed offences of similar nature but we “claimed the credit” didn’t we? Though uncommon, his isn’t the first case that I’ve heard of. Its has happened on our level (sec 3) too but of course being kind and gracious and out of respect for the parties involved, I shall not give names. I feel that Mr. Ang’s take on student’s opinions is a little over the limit. Indeed, like the government, he has the school’s welfare at heart. But what about us – the student body? Has the school as a whole ever considered the plight we writers are in? We have no medium though which we can express ourselves, not online much less on paper. So, tell me please, where does that leave us? We are merely giving our 2 cents worth and also humoring our friends. Of course this shouldn’t be done at the expense of someone else say a teacher in this case. But certainly just some harmless comments about the teacher wouldn’t be in the red? Certainly, we will not make such statements without evidence but if there is cause and justification for it, why not? What the sec 2 boy did was definitely out of the question because from what I know, he made hurtful comments about teachers’ and classmates’ physical appearances. Obviously this greenhorn has lots to learn about being witty yet within limits or should I say lessons on maturity? I feel what he did was way under the belt. To discredit people is already putting one foot in the grave. To hide behind a mask, nailing the coffin. Perhaps, it is time for change, a revolution, and a better tomorrow as our beloved politicians love to proclaim with much enthusiasm though I believe it less and less each day. For starters, lets have a private online forum where only true – blue Anderson writers would be allowed. These might be a source of comfort for Mr. Ang because at the very least, our more meaningful remarks would be kept within ourselves. An interesting point to note is that every time such an incident crops up, Mr. Ang never fails to make mention of it but he only notifies us of the problem. What about his proposed solution? For three good years I’ve heard nothing but his ‘pressing issues’ even in sec 1 when I was none the wiser, he didn’t have any long – term solution. To spell it out simply, the school on its part is doing nothing than providing short – term solutions but in the long run, how effective would such a method be? From the way I see it, their methods are more of deterrence to would be  offenders  and nothing more. Such a tried and tested method would soon work off all its magic. At times, I really have this urge to grab my trusty pen and work my  magic  but my run – in with the school or more specifically Mr. Ang has  deterred  me. As you can see, all is not lost. The school’s tried and tested method still holds and hopefully so until I graduate. And when that time comes, I would say,” Au revoir Anderson! Never fret, it’s never too late to teach an  old dog  new tricks.”   Nofing is a sec 3 student would takes Mr. Ang’s opinions to heart ever since his run – in with him a long time ago and has been faithfully chronically the more meaningful happenings at Anderson.

      By: Nofing  Teachers have an inferiority complex. It’s very obvious – take a look at good old Mr. Ang. His catch phrase though I only heard it once, was “I know I look like a fool talking to you people on stage.” Real fascinating. And much recently, the most  respectable  Mdm. Neo joined those ranks too. Her catch phrase, “I know that even before I start (speaking) some of you will call me ‘ siao ’ but I have to do so for the sake of the class.” Sounds like a true blue PAP supporter eh? Now before I digress into PAP politics, let me make mention of Mdm. Neo’s most  commendable  speech all of which happened within the four walls with a hole in class 3 / 2. The bell was just about to go. I was as usual waiting to bid farewell being the most courteous student that I am. Today had been a most meaningful Geography lesson. Why? Because Shawn was seating with us and Bo Hui had apparently skipped the first lesson, lost count of time and didn’t even turn up for school, which, is a good thing. Shawn had served very well as my  personal entertainer  but in Mdm Neo’s undisputed opinion, he was a personal disaster. And disaster there was! Mdm. Neo took it t herself to berate the two of us. Quite simply, she stood at the OHP as she always does (because no one will think of having her near themselves) and for the ninth time looked as if though she was on the verge of an emotional breakdown, placed her marker down, glared at us (Rather contradictory, beats me too. But Mdm. Neo is most unpredictable at times) and started her little speech. “I don’t wish to say this but there are a few students who are very disruptive. They choose not to or cannot fir into society and form their own group or a delinquent subculture. They value things which society doesn’t value a lot.” Pauses to look at Shawn and I then draws some weird diagram on the OHP before continuing, “Things like rudeness and defiance,” pauses again to look at us. And so her speech goes, punctured with sporadic pauses now and then and also injected with Shawn’s cynical remarks and our laughter. Little is known as to why Mdm. Neo embarked on her highly controversial and questionable speech. Some kind souls who were most touched by her speech said that she was sincere for once. Not very credible but it’ll do. Shawn on the other hand had an entirely different opinion. “Sincerity will not melt stone.” That sounds more like my idea of the  catch phrase  of the year! Indeed Mdm. Neo must have been a sorry sight. But I beg to differ. One, we (Shawn and I) have come to a conclusion – That must have been a publicity stunt which further proves her mental instability. We don’t mean that in a bad way. All we want to say is Mdm. Neo seemed rather out of touch today like as if though she was leaving us (which I hope she would and also leave for good) and that speech was some sort of farewell speech. Two, we wish to thank her for her kindness and concern but could she please wake up to the notion of actions speak louder than words and help us ace our Geography instead? Or must she in what is supposed to be thoughtful and sincere insult us. Not that she came hard on but she played it cool with nearly 80% of her little speech directed at us. We applaud her for her subtleness but hope that as soon as  sows  learn to fly, so would she learn the true meaning of sincerity. This refers to being forthright and to the point. For example, Shawn and I were discussing the different ways to shut Mdm. Neo up. Suggestions raised included throwing the pen knife at her, flinging paper balls and last but not least, walking out of the class. Unfortunately, we were mentally sound and ran through those ideas once more and the verdict was – lets just sit here enjoy the air con and annoy Mdm. Neo. This might sound very passive in comparism to the aforementioned ideas and we can’t agree more. For now, we shall follow by example – that is to say learn from Mdm. Neo. She’s not the only one who can do things subtlety. We shall show her our appreciation by sitting together during her future lessons and see how long it’ll take before she yells at us and flings the OHP over (Now you know why she stands next to the OHP and not outside the class). Bearing that in mind, as good OP supporters, we shall declare, “That has been long enough” I know, I know, you’re referring to my article.  Nofing is still unable to get over the incident, having been influenced by Mdm. Neo’s mental instability; he now takes to drawing a flying sow wearing a cloak bearing the alphabets NEO on it. Of course we all know he’s a big fan of the matrix.

      By: Nofing  Just today, Ms. Yoong my English teacher for two years posed an interesting question to the class, “What does marriage mean to you?” I, on one of these rare occasions was at a loss for words. So much more when asked to express my opinion to the entire class? Having thought over this issue carefully, I, sad to say still have not come up with a satisfactory answer. When I stood in front of the class, the first thing that came rushing into my mind was, “How am I supposed to make my answer  unconventional ?” I thought and thought but nothing not even suggestions from fellow classmates could do the trick. This ranged from, “Marriage is the legal consent to have carnal knowledge of someone,” to “Marriage equals to free sex.” In a nutshell, this boils down to a naughty three – letter word – sex. Indeed in this more conservative Asian society of ours, sex is seldom an appropriate topic at the dinner table. However, to equate marriage to sex does seem to be a rather flawed equation. I’m sure that by reading the aforementioned opinions from  well – meaning  friends, one would doubt the company I mix with. However, before you present the verdict, lets be honest. At the tender age of fifteen, which hot – blooded male would resist the thought of sex; much less a lifetime of free sex? In comparism, if such a question was to be answered by the opposite sex, I’m sure the response given would have been entirely different. This might (I’m just guessing) range from, “ A sense of security,” to “everlasting love.” Honestly speaking, which girls wouldn’t want to dwell in such a fantasy, which is seldom possible in this fickle, demanding world? Having explored the possible responses from both genders, one would come to a conclusion that the meaning of marriage goes beyond moral issues but to fundamental ones like the biological make up of men and women alike. I do not claim to be an expert in this area but as far as I’m concerned, men being more  primitive , will definitely wish to satisfy basic needs before moving on to more complex needs and wants which require greater intellect which is why some men stop at brothels having barely satisfied their basic needs. Women, on the other hand are more sentimental. Apparently, this includes their basic instinct. I mean, it’s the way the human body is designed – do first, talk later. Which is why women would rather be loved emotionally than to have it expressed physically. However, this cannot be said for all women where there are exceptions of women leaving a marriage because the men cannot satisfy their basic needs. Then again, the same can be said for men where the few exceptions also wish to be loved emotionally and the physical aspect need not necessarily come into the picture. My purpose of writing this article isn’t to find the meaning of marriage but to discuss its effectiveness as an ‘O’ level examination question. Indeed this was Tuesday’s ‘O’ level English oral examination question. I believe that the purpose of the GCE ‘O’ level examinations is meant to test the proficiency of students in various areas of study. However, such a question when probed further goes beyond superficial issues like sex. It requires much thinking before answering not because it takes time to find a satisfactory answer which the examiner will appreciate but also to see if it conflicts with ones beliefs. Being a Christian by faith, I find it hard to provide an  unconventional  answer for such a question. In fact, to come up with a  decent  answer would prove to be a difficult task what more unconventional one! As a Christian, there are many  laws  so to say governing marriage. It is seen as a sacred process, which every Christian should go through only once in a lifetime. Which is why providing answers relating to ‘one night stands’ and answers of similar nature would not be right. On the contrary, it is stated that men and women are made for each other but to the extent of free sex? That might be testing the limits. I do realize that what I mention here seems to be rather contradictory with regard to my actions. However, one must realize that what I say outside does not go to the point of conflicting with my faith. No matter how ‘ out of bounds’  my statements may have been, one must realize that it only flirts around the surface, teasing it lightly and that is all. But to answer such a question, even at the best of my ability, my response is as follows. Marriage is the unity of two imperfect humans who regardless of their genders, can live together in harmony and accommodate each other’s flaws and appreciate them for who they are and not what they are or what they can provide. Marriage is more than an act of love but also a lifetime commitment. In the event of either party being unfaithful, instead of walking the easier route of divorcing, they should take the difficult but permanent route, which should involve professional counseling for both parties and the support of their families. Marriage is another stage in life, which further emphasizes the need for compromise. On a larger scale, this can be put to practice between countries where compromise amongst the parities involved can prevent conflict, which might lead to war. Therefore, marriage is not just an act of love but also a valuable lesson in life. Now, even as a Christian, I must occasionally  forget  myself and therefore the other type of response which if I don’t make mention of, I would certainly live to regret. When two humans in the heat of the moment tie the knot, this is called a shot – gun marriage. Superstars who include Britney Spears have acted out such scenarios. Of course when such an unfortunate incident arises, it will definitely lead to a divorce. However, there is a way around this. It is known as a one – nightstand for the fickle minded and a long – time (platonic) relationship. In both instances, the concept of legality is given a miss and this, might give the couple(s) involved a false sense of security. Whatever the case, it beats polygamy, which as you people should know is against the law. In conclusion, marriage is a must for law – breakers (committing polygamy) who want to have the best of both worlds – sex and breaking the law.     Nofing is still confused and is trying hard to learn a valuable lesson in life (compromise) without getting married. Obviously, he needs to find a balance between the secular world and his religion, which more often than not is impossible.

      By: Nofing  I’ve learnt the meaning of standing up for your beliefs. It all happened today. When I had a ‘baptism of fire’ so to say. It made me realize one thing – being with bad eggs will cause you to turn bad as well. It’s just so sad that I had to lose friends along the way. But as the old saying goes (or is it my  saying ) gone with the bad in with the good. Whatever the case, I’ve found out that I’m still good – At least where my beliefs are concerned. I don’t stand for calling others ‘fatherless bastards’; nor disgracing my family or myself; nor being so thick – skinned to the extent of having everyone walk out on you. I had better stop here before things get personal. But as you can see the person in question is none other than Ron. The stinking… …you know… … I’m amazed that he’s still around and still acting like as though he’s so cool. I find it getting more and more difficult to write things in perspective but I must try me very best before I disgrace the name of my family and myself. Now looking at things in perspective: Ron to me is a like a pool of water. He’s always the way people shape him and I will always stand by that. Oh yeah, and did I mention he’s a bully? I can’t help but question his credibility regarding his parentage. You see, humans have something known s a guilt conscience and will pick on others who are in the same boat because, like a smoke – screen, this would draw attention away from themselves. And Ron keeps on picking on Bo Hui and Wai Keat. Why? For the record, Bo Hui’s father died of cancer when Bo Hui was young and Wai Keat has a medical problem. I am not specially mentioning this two extremely pleasant souls to spite them or anything but surely one would see the irony of this all. Having been a friend of Ron for some time, I now know the reason behind his being retained and I’m none too surprised. In fact, I’m grateful for him because he has walked the beaten path and I now know how to avoid the same  ending  as him. With every passing word, I am feeling more and more ashamed of myself. Instances of Ron and his unfair treatment towards others have come flooding back. Connections regarding a case, which I missed out, have joined back to complete the jigsaw. I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to those whom I may have mistreated or whom I did not offer help to when Ron unfairly treated them. I also urge all there people to come forward and speak up against such injustice. To put it across bluntly, I do not want the level to be dominated by a  retainee  and his  sidekicks . The sad thing is, many of his so – called ‘sidekicks’ are in fact fair weather friends. I admit that I was indeed one of them but having straightened my thinking; I can now safely watch Ron destroy himself from afar. Enough of Ron; lets move on to further examine the different characters who ‘hang out’ with him.  Losers  No hard feelings please; this group of people are the misfits of society and to escape from being picked on by others, they join a group for temporary protection. I pity this group of people the most because their situation is akin to that of choosing between the devil and the deep blue sea.  Manipulators  Like I said earlier, Ron is like a pool of water. This group of people has a measurable intellect and uses this to manipulate Ron for their personal gains. I personally despise this group of people the most. I mean Ron is retained and that’s no need to further emphasize  this  by making use of him. Then again, he deserves it.  Man on the Street  The man on the street is innocent but finds Ron and company interesting. He or she will ‘hang out’ with them for a while until he loses interest and leaves the group. Now that the various groups of people who might be associated with Ron have been listed, I must as Mdm. Tang once said, “If you can’t be a solution, don’t be a problem.” I shall now attempt to find ways and means to end Ron’s tyranny or more likely the manipulators tyranny. Like I said, the people Ron mixes with define him. So I suggest we place Ron amongst a group of monkeys. As the saying goes, “Monkey see; monkey do.” In this case, theres nothing for the monkeys to see or do so they’ll just pass time scratching each other. (Wait! How can they scratch each other if no one teaches them to? But I’m sure Ron can teach them. After all  monkey see; monkey do .) For the losers, I’m at a loss for words. They are so pitiful yet at the same time they aren’t exactly the ones whom you would want to interact with usually. So, I propose we send them for an Adam Khoo course and see if they can change their believes. After all, I’m a loser so are you. Wait a minute that sounds a little wrong doesn’t it? For the manipulators, what can I say? I mean they constantly prey on the inferior lot of people. Therefore, the probable solution would be to isolate them on a far away island like Bali where they’ll be bombed by the terrorists who apparently are already manipulated by someone else. Like they always say getting a taste of your own medicine. And last but not least, the man on the street. Nothing new here; they’ll just look around, maybe be part of the group for a period of time before leaving. No harm done but while he or she is at not, why not try manipulating Ron? Its jolly good fun you know? I’ve said my piece, I’ve lost a friendship I wished I never had and I’m glad for that. After all, one should see the way Ron’s  ex  – classmates treat him – with such distaste like as though they had seen something awful like a  garbage bag , which leaves a foul aftertaste.  Nofing has not gotten over this and swears to fight it out with Ron to the end. Unfortunately, the after effects of sublime influence have made themselves known and he now spends his time giving new meanings to the acronym RON. Examples include, ‘Rotten Old Niger’ and ‘Retained Overaged Nitwit’.

      By: Nofing  We all know of nations fighting over territory. Over  landmarks  like  Pedra Branca , which further extends a nation’s territory. But classes experiencing border crisis? This unusual topic has been tackled by my fellow writer Eric and I’m here to present yet another case of border crisis. Take a bow Eric. The temporary classroom block if not good for nothing still serves a purpose – rattling the chipboard walls and see how long it’ll be before the partition drops. After all, the whole structure is  temporary  isn’t it? Perhaps more light should be shed on this issue of border crisis. As far as I know, it originated from Anderson, when students who sat near these partitions grew bored of the lesson (which is quite often, ands that’s saying something) they started throwing their weight against it. This caused the partition to rock violently and thereby disrupting the neighboring class’s lesson. It has proven to be great fun when one side bangs and the other returns the favor. And as humans evolved for the sake of evolution, so has the banging of these partitions. As in order with this year’s theme – magical, enterprising and wow, Andersonians have taken it to heart. A splendid example would be the mutilation of the partitions. Major Chong is a busy man but recent events have made him busier. You see, holes in these  so – called  walls are a  so – called  eyesore whereas in my opinion, makes the school look more like the  darker  side of LA. Indeed, such a scene is not appealing to everyone but  compromises  must be made right? So, instead of making holes in the wall, students have taken to removing the wall altogether. This in itself is magical – how often do you get to witness such a ceremony? Enterprising – if the school ever needs construction works to rebuild the school, here are some ideal ones. And wow – I mean, wow…literally; students are really getting the hand of multitasking aren’t they? Now, removing the wall isn’t too difficult. In fact, its part of the cause and effect cycle of banging it. The partition itself is only meant to allocate the space to each class and determine the class’s boundaries. Unlike bomb shelters, these walls are unable to withstand vigorous banging or rocking. And of course, when the glue (can you believe it? The school is so  enterprising . Temporary, really!) is torn apart from the wall, which has already began, the wall will have to fall due to an unstable equilibrium and gravitational forces. And being enterprising students, they must make the best of the fallen wall. So they’ll see which side has a disliked teacher/student and have the wall fall towards that direction. So far, there have been no incidents of such nature and I sincerely hope so since I’m sitting next to the wall but as a good student, I would now like to share some of there magical techniques on banging the wall, which will certainly make you, go “wow”.  Beginner’s guide to banging the wall  The good ‘ole way…  Simply ram your elbow  ala  a rugby tackle at the wall and marvel at Newton’s laws and the conservation of energy. Note, this method no matter how macho it makes you feels is ill – advised, as you will feel great discomfort in your elbow the following day.  Knock, knock, who’s there?  This method was developed by the normal stream of 2002 last year during reading sessions in the hall where they repeatedly slammed their reading materials on the floor much to the supervising teacher’s annoyance. This method has proven to be a hit among passive students who only want to make noise without having any fatalities. Like the normal stream have done, just take a hard object with a decent surface area of preferably 100cm2 and slam it against the wall repeatedly. Guaranteed satisfaction, which will make the DC, that follows more bearable. Last but not least…  The retainee’s method…  Yes, yes as a tribute to Ron who started this method, those who wish to follow suit needn’t worry about being retained; obviously, that requires more  skill . This method involves shouting vulgarities at the wall in the belief that sound travels through hard objects faster. Obviously, the nut head hasn’t been doing much reading up ( retained ?) otherwise he would have realized that the wall is make up of chipboard and sponge which doesn’t propagate sound but on the contrary absorbs it. Not to be defeated, there is a plan B. This involves throwing or banging (or a combination of both) either a basketball or chair at the wall. The result would be the students at the other side of the wall retaliate in kind or ask Mr. Ang to witness the event.  A few words of advise before I end this piece and proceed to fine tuning my methods of wall banging, one must realize that at the end of the day, the school is where you receive your education and not where you bang walls. Banging of walls or fellow students should preferably be done outside school.  Nofing has learnt his lesson and has stopped banging the wall. Unfortunately, those nut heads led by Ron on the other side of the wall have not learnt their lesson. He feels that those losers should go bang their heads against a wall or bang someone. She bangs, she bangs…
