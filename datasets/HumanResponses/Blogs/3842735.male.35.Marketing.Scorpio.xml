            "when will my fingers grow back ?" ...           &nbsp;    let me tell you the story of a father and a son and about what simple and uncontrolled rage can do and cannot undo ...        &nbsp;    one day, a father came home with a brand new shiny red&nbsp;truck ... he was so happy that he loved that truck so much that he cleaned and wiped it dry and covered it with a truck cover so dust and dirt wouldn't mess up the shiny red paint ...        &nbsp;    this father also had a son, barely 4 years old ... the kid was always in a playful mood, and this the father so loved about his son, that he played with his son every night sometimes roughly, sometimes gently ...        &nbsp;    one day, early in the morning, the kid was in a playful mood that he went out to play in the yard with his toy tools, hammer, shovel and pails&nbsp;trying to be a make-believe carpenter ... in his glee, he noticed his Pop's shiny red truck, how the red paint shined at him that he began to hammer the side of the truck with his toy hammer ...        &nbsp;    the commotion caught the attention of his father, in time to see his son hammering away and scratching and denting the side of his shiny new truck ... the father so enraged took the same hammer and taught of punishing his son for being naughty by pounding on the kid's hand ... the kid of course, cried and howled in pain and the father only stopped when he realised that his son's hand was bloodied and his son passed out ...        &nbsp;    the father immediately brought his son to the hospital ... while at the hospital, the doctors did all that they can do but explained that the damage caused to the boy's hand was so severe that they had to amputate the fingers of the boy's hand ... the father was so stricken with pity at his son and anger at himself for losing his temper that he could not do anything but stay at his son's side crying until he awoke ...        &nbsp;    when the son awoke, he saw the stubbly bandages on his fingers and saw his father crying, at which the son said "don't cry, Pops, i was a very bad boy and i shouldn't have scratched and hammered at your shiny new truck and i deserve to be punished" ... at this point the father even cried harder at what his son said to him ... seeing his father cry even harder and his bandaged hands, he said "it's ok, Pops, i forgive you for punishing me ... but Pops, when will my fingers grow back ?" ...        &nbsp;    in the story above, we need to be always in control and not let emotion cloud our judgement or actions for we may do something that cannot be taken back ...

      the alarm clock rings and a mad dash for the bathroom was the default instinct for the morning ...   i said to myself "you are late" while i make a schizo-change to my "professional" self ... "do i have the same colored socks?" while peering down my pants ...   a quick bite and an even quicker sip of coffee was all i could manage "i am late.", i said to myself again ...   up, up and away through the door like superman is to the window, i could have passed off as a wannabee superhero but not today coz "i am late" ...  traffic ain't that bad, my car was breezing through the city streets, i could have sworn that traffic was unusually light but i instead i thanked the high heavens for "i am late" ...  arrived at the office, "where is everybody?" as my voice echoed through the hallway ... the security guard answers "hell, it's a sunday, mister, you best be getting home, no work today" ...

      aw yeah, 4rth of July yesterday, an american independence day ... you would think this is something that i would not think about, huh ... well, kinda, if it weren't for my cuz (and 2 nieces), an americanised kaPangpangan having stayed in seattle for most of her life, who's crashing at my house now and a will smith film of the same name, i wouldn't give it a single thought ...  that is until, my nieces asked for fireworks ... "fireworks?" i said, "well, honey, there ain't no fiestas right now" ... "but unc, it's the 4rth of July" was my nieces' retort ... hell, i don't even know if the Filipino independence day is 12th of June or 4rth of July ... why should i bother with the Yank's", when two pair of soulful eyes are gazing right back at me ...  "ok", i said, "i'll make you a deal, we won't have fireworks, but we'll have cake and ice cream, how's that?" ... "but it's not gonna be the same, no loud cracks, no flashing lights, no fun!" said the elder of the two ...   lemme think "ok, what about if we sing and dance to it, we've got videoke!" ... "what's videoke?" ... "well, it's a Filipino invention where we can sing to music by reading the words flashing on the TV screen " i proudly said and beaming with pride that a Filipino invented a way of entaertainment that is now a household name ...  "ok, i think it'll be fun" said the younger of the two "i wanna sing ..." and we got down to some cake, ice cream and good old song's throughout most of the night until bedtime ...  while i was in the troes of a matchbox 20 song, i think it was "unwell", i juz couldn't help but think why us, Filipinos, don't take time out to crack some fireworks, watch parades and listen to good old patriotic songs anymore ... instead we drink beer, eat pulutan and belt out old and new hits from videokes, be it baptism, weddings, graduations, birthdays and even independence days ... is that our way of celebrating and giving homage to special days? ... or maybe we juz don't bother with it and videoke is more fun ... well, whatever it is, my nieces kinda enjoyed every minute of it and when they said that it was more fun than fireworks, i knew that the Filipino videoke bug has them hooked ...  maybe it's not that bad, maybe us, Filipinos, are onto something ... big time ...  oh well, next song, pls ...

      deja vu ...  deja vu ... Oxford English Dictionary defines it as the feeling of having already experienced the present situation, french for "already seen" ...  deja vu ... it's like something, a person, an event that happened now but in your mind you had experience that before ... it's like when you meet someone for the first time but in your mind you seem to know this someone from before ... or when an event happens to you the first time and yet you seem to have gone through it before like walking through a familiar street the first time ...  deja vu ...
