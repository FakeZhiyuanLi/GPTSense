      Apparently the keyword that has brought the most visitors to my site is &quot;toddler&quot. In these Michael Jackson obsessed times, I have to consider the sexual aspect of these searches, and frankly the idea of someone whacking one out over a twenty-two year old picture of me is hilarious.  Today I got the wrong bus back from work, probably something to do with my ridiculously high blood sugar levels. This bus delivered to me three more ill-advised Christmas houses, including the mother of them all. It has lights - still, flashing and animated. It has a Father Christmas on the roof. It has a Christmas tree. It has three enormous inflatables lit with spotlights. I expect on Christmas Day Donner and Blitzen will be flying in the sky above with laser beams on their antlers. Everyone on the bus looked at it as one might look as a UFO. It was astonishing.  Come to think of it, I think it might be legendary. Frog told me someone drove him to see a very similar house last year. Could they be one and the same?

      Firstly, a disclaimer: I'm not normally this grotesque. Well, not always. OK, I'm quite often this grotesque but I'm normally very charming about it.  The following is quite an everyday UK office story. In fact, the longer I stay in this office, the more I realise quite how true to life  urlLink The Office  is. Today two things happened in the name of  urlLink Children in Need . Firstly, King Tubby - the annoying halfwit who sits on my pod and twitters away incessantly - had his head shaved. He knew this was going to happen and yet he still came in with gel on his hair. Needless to say it was painful and he whinged a lot. This is King Tubby's forte.   Secondly, there was a doughnut eating competition. Seven people entered. Within the space of five doughnuts there were three of us left: Old Punk, Rugby Player and me. Old Punk, despite his slight build, was putting them away pretty quickly. Rugby Player was by now the hotly-tipped winner. I was calmly eating my way along in third place. Everyone was getting pretty whipped up, in that peculiarly smutty British way. My boss told me very sternly "Don't lick and don't wipe!" and then she turned red, burst out laughing and spent the next two minutes in embarrassed hysterics.  So, as we came groaning to our doughnut climax the scores stood as follows: Rugby Player was leading with 14 doughnuts in his belly and further one in his hand; Old Punk was second with his thirteenth partially digested; I was third and slowly masticating my way through my twelfth. Old Punk was looking smug, his goatee coaked in sugar and strawberry jam. In fact, he looked too smug, and very quickly the smile was wiped off his face as he started retching. He held it in all the way to the toilets. I think vomiting is grounds for disqualification, but he did damn well considering he turned up to work still drunk.  That meant that it was just Rugby Player and me. He was looking pretty comfortable, but I think it was just psychology. I was regretting having eaten a hearty sausage and black pudding baguette for breakfast and a good four ham sandwiches for lunch. But mostly I was regretting the previous twelve doughnuts. By now I was holding my current doughnut as far away from me as possible. I didn't want to see it, I didn't want to smell it, and I sure as hell didn't want to taste it. I looked at it.  It looked back at me, glistening and greasy. People were shouting at me to carry on. They were pretty frenzied. I looked at it. I stared. I stared at the crusted, sticky sugar and the leaking glistening jam. Rugy Player was sitting next to me waiting for me to catch up. I knew I couldn't eat another three. I couldn't even eat this one. What was I going to do?  I stared a few seconds longer. It felt like minutes. I could hear the frenzied voices of my savage workmates, faces daubed with war-paint jam and waving trays of sticky doughnuts at me. And suddenly my path became clear.  With a quick look up at my audience and a triumphant grin I took my fear, my doughy nemesis in hand and shovelled all of its sticky pallid mass into my face. Tucking the excess bits into my cheeks with my fingers I prepared myself for the final internal showdown. This was no longer about me and Rugby Player: this was about me, my gag reflex and the doughnut.  Screams erupted around me. I had delivered the ultimate horror they so eagerly desired. I chewed. I could barely keep my lips together. I chewed again, mashing down the same bits. I wriggled my tongue, trying to move the heavy mass into a better masticatory position. I chewed, struggling now. I gagged, my eyes googled, I held my chest. I chewed again. I gagged again. Rising to my feet I staggered towards the bin. What was this madman about to do?  I gagged once more, and delivering myself from the jaws of nausea, I opened wide my mouth, plucked out the entire soggy doughnut and consigned it to the bin. Turning, I shook hands with the victor knowing that while he may have eaten more, I had provided the thrill and the theatre and the debased grotesque spectacle that everyone had come to see.  If I have to work in an office much longer I will start mutilating myself with a stapler under the desk.

       On my bus route home from work tonight I spotted six prematurely festive houses. With a good six weeks still to go I think the most accurate way to gauge the growing Christmas mania will be to record the mushrooming of incandescent vulgarity on the streets of Worcester.  The Legionnaire's disease appears to be wearing off. I think it may have simply been a cold after all, even if my cough still sounds like a death-rattle.  It looks like Wigan and Millwall are also interested in buying Darren Huckerby, so he'll probably play against us at some point in the second half of the season and stick a hat-trick past Greeno.

      Dear Diary,  I am sorry I have not written in you for many days now. In Winter I find that staving off the demons of despair cannot be achieved by sitting in an English country garden; for some reason the cold and dark is their element, quite the opposite of what we are led to believe. I have therefore decided to re-christen these doleful beings  urlLink Moomins . Moomins, you see, are from Finland, where it is very cold indeed, and there they thrive. Furthermore, as a child I remember many sleepless nights bequeathed to me by their insistant and sinister working upon my mind.  So in the Winter I find that the most effective methods of suppressing the Moomins of despair is to remain active and engage myself in dancing, music, merrymaking and cavorting of as many types and variations as possible. It is with this in mind that last Thursday I took a day off from suspended animation to go to Hereford.  If, dear diary, you knew Hereford, you would appreciate the irony of my previous statement. It is a more pleasant town than Worcester, not  qualitatively (there is little difference in quality of experience) but quantitatvely: there is less of Hereford than there is of Worcester, and were there less of Worcester it would certainly be as pleasant a place as Hereford. But I digress. The irony of course is that Hereford is currently a  urlLink plague town.                                                                         Legionnaire's disease has struck and though, dear diary, I have little conception of its wicked workings, I am aware of two things. Firstly, its source on this occasion: allegedly the brewery of  urlLink Samuel Bulmer , whose ales (brewed under licence) and ciders I have enjoyed for many a year, has issued forth a noxious steam which has contaminated the very air of the town. Secondly, its preferred victims:  urlLink the elderly . So far the modest outbreak has helped to stave off the terrible consequences of Malthus' predictions by removing fourteen of them from the surface of the earth. It is confidently predicted that this year the pension queue at the central post office of Hereford will be greatly diminished. I am afraid, dear diary, that their fate may well also be mine.  We (Frog, Naomi and I) arrived in Hereford in good health, found an eating establishment of sound character and appearance, partook of ice-creams in the breezy November afternoon, inspected the Mappa Mundi in the unpretentious cathedral and browsed  urlLink a shop well-stocked with all manner of rare cinematograph projections.  It was a happy day. In the evening we returned to Worcester, as large and lacklustre as ever - the town, that is, not ourselves.  That evening the Frog treated us to the sincere and moving janglings of his rag-tag ensemble, the  urlLink Economy Prostitutes , and it was a lively show indeed. All things considered, diary, the day was pleasantly used. However, I awoke the next morning with a throat as rough as sandpaper and a needling pain in the sinuses caused by acute blockage which persisted all the way through the weekend. I finish this entry in a state of modest agitiation, wondering whether I linger in the foothills of influenza or of a more sinister debilitation altogether. It seems the Moomins of despair may yet have the last word.

      Finally, after much persuasion from James and the rest of the world in general, I have bought myself a little minidisc walkman. It's a neat little thing. Tonight I am recording  all my Wilco albums  onto one disc. How utterly obscene!  I had a good weekend.  Humble Boy  at the Malvern Theatre on Friday night started out a little bit drawing-room, but developed into a sweetly affecting reimagining of Hamlet set in a Cotswold garden. Norwich beat Milwall 3-1 on Saturday, and I went to a party dressed as a cowboy. Gran cooked a filling Sunday lunch and the people at the Austrian pub in town are starting to recognise my face. I was definitely below par in the office this morning.  If anyone in Worcester is reading, Frog's band, Economy Prostitutes, have a gig at the Marr's Bar (sic) on Thursday night. All proceeds will go toward buying a scooter for a man with no legs in Thailand. Really.  My next post will be a return to the normal aimless ramblings.

      As I was trying to get through another day of suspended animation in my air-conditioned, hermetically sealed office, I started browsing the company's intranet. A number of random clicks found this gem of a discussion. I had no idea civil engineers were quite such fascinating types.    Subject:  Blockages caused by re-cycled toilet paper.    Drab Weltering  Working on a reactive maintenance contractor - does anybody know of any evidence that would indicate that using re-cycled toilet paper is more likely to cause toilets to block than normal toilet paper. if this is the case would it be only certain types of recycled paper? Could it be that it might not degrade as well as normal paper?     Advise Badly  does the "poke through" test include for folding it double - just in case of accidents     Lads Return  Are you all mad???????????????   Turn All Mocking  When paper goes through the recycling process, individual paper fibers are broken into shorter lengths - this is why recycled paper is normally of a poorer quality than paper manufactured from virgin wood pulp. Logic follows that the poorer quality recycled paper is weaker & therefore more likely to disintegrate - however it is conceivable that a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper might make the paper thicker to counter act this. One criteria by which strength/quality of toilet papers are tested is commonly refered to as the "poke through" test, but I'm not sure how scientific/controlled these tests are or where you could find results for the strength ratings of individual brands.     Ash Windsail   There is a fair amount of research in the amount and type of "gross solids" (ie the floating bits) that arise in sewer systems. A software program has been prepared (by others) to help predict what may arise. Water (collection networks) have a fair amount of experience in modelling the movement of the sediments (ie the heavier bits of sand, grit, etc) as well as the pollutant loads if this is of help.     Hi-tech Neighbour Blaze  From my experience, loo paper is specifically designed to have low wet strength, i.e. it tears up easily when wet, this is helped by the little perforations between each sheet. the turbulance in the drain should shred the paper quickly. You are likely to get more problems when the loo paper is allowed to run out, and users resort to tissues or worse still, kitchen roll, which have high wet strength, and do not shred easily. Kitchen roll is virtually indestructible, and comes in large sheets.     Fin Jowls  Try Liken Rainbow at Brunel University. He does a lot of drainage research in this area.   All names have been anagrammatized to protect the innocent.

       In fact, he loves us all. He told us so at least twelve times on Friday night when we saw him - and the rest of the Flaming Lips - treating us to a number of rousing tunes, quirky bits of video art and giant balloons. The best, and indeed only, gig I have seen at Birmingham Academy. Heartfelt thanks to Dave for getting the tickets and James for reminding me when the gig was. It's lovely when a band cares about their audience.  Talking of love, my feelings for Norwich City FC border on adoration, especially when we play as beautifully as we did yesterday and come away with a 3-1 victory. And Ipswich lost 4-3. The world's a happy place. After taking him along to a couple of games I may also have converted Frog to the cause. He admires our attacking, open play, our use of the wings and our evident team spirit. He says he'd be happy to accompany my old man to the game in Coventry on Valentine's day. This beautiful thought will warm the cockles of my heart as I'm jogging around the streets of Rochester, NY, pursued by Courtney wielding a big stick when, if I were back home in Blighty, I could be watching the game too.  This is also the dawning of a new era for Junkopia. I have decided to embrace Blogger, the tool of honest web diarists the world over. I like the fact that it will organise my blog in all sorts of ways and archive all my old posts automatically, because I really can't be bothered with that kind of housework. I think of it as a hard working Filipino maid with inviting eyes. Well, maybe.

      Yesterday I went to Grosvenor Square in London. There's a beautiful building there: Georgian neo-classical with lots of red brick and white stone. It's called the Canadian embassy. I didn't get to see inside it. I had to go to the ugly 60's building at the other end of the square which is the US embassy.  While I was there a very nice man gave me some advice. He said "When you get a job in America you should wear an undershirt underneath your dress shirt." Apparently it's customary to do so and people look at you funny if you don't. He also put something in my passport called a visa.  I'm leaving this country in twenty-five days. Is America ready to recieve me? Is England ready to lose me? I don't know, but I'm going anyway.

      Further proof that  urlLink American comedy is in a bit of a hole  right now. The last "all new" episode of  Friends  I saw was five minutes of new jokes and a long trawl through the archives.  Will & Grace  is poor and there are plenty more where that came from. The only worthwhile US comedy I've seen is  urlLink  Curb Your Enthusiasm  , which in Bush's America pushes the envelope too far to be honoured with gongs. Thing is, it's the same style of comedy as  The Office , but  The Office  is "ethnic" (yes, I'm finally part of an ethnic minority), and so over here it's worthy as well as funny.

      I'm not allowed to get a job right now. So with all this wonderful free time I've been trying to do something worthwhile. A bunch of people I know quite fancy having their own blog, but don't think they've got enough to write about. Well, having thought for a while, I've made a group blog, and people seem to be using it. Lovely. It's called  urlLink One Thing I Learned Today  and it might be worth a look.  It has snowed here every day this month. You don't so much walk down the street as walk down a chasm of snow. There's enough snow in our back yard to build an igloo. I might well do so.

      OK, I promised. I'll deliver.  A great director once said (and I'm paraphrasing here) "All I've ever done is re-make the same film over and over." I can't remember who the director was, and I can't look it up because all my film books are back in England. But trust me on this one. He was a director, and he said something similar to the words above.  This stunningly badly-remembered passage can be very appropriately applied to the career arc of Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu. His latest film glides into the showroom very much like a mk. II  Amores Perros . It's more refined, shorter, more disciplined, lingers longer and strikes deeper than his much-lauded debut feature.  21 Grams is set in the US. (As an aside, I hope that this doesn't mean that Hollywood has already devoured the main practitioners behind the Mexican new wave and that Innaritu will follow a similar path to his compatriot Alfonso Cauron, who has so far managed to dodge back and forth between Hollywood and his indigenous cinema with  Great Expectations ,  Y Tu Mama Tambien  and the imminent third installment of the Harry Potter series.) It employs a similar disjointed narrative technique to  Amores Perros  as we skip backwards and forwards through time catching glimpses of the principal three characters' stories. Early on we see blood, we see the angry and wounded faces of the leads, played by Benicio Del Toro, Naomi Watts and Sean Penn, and we wonder what twists of fate could conspire to bring them here. 21 Grams is essentially a puzzle, a puzzle with a strong symmetry and, thankfully, a puzzle that solves itself before our eyes.  Late in the film, Benicio Del Toro's character, Jack Jordan, is drunkenly staring at a cheap print of a tiger on the wall of his flyblown motel room. It is a brief moment which conjures up the lines:    urlLink  Tyger Tyger burning bright, In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye,  Could frame thy fearful symmetry?    21 Grams is essentially a fatalistic film. The characters are locked into this string of events, and this means that its gaze is dispassionate. Addiction, extreme religion, terminal illness, emotional breakdowns are all observed with the same cool eye. No judgments are cast because the fates of all the films protagonists are set. Is it right that Naomi Watts' character uses cocaine to escape her pain? Is it right if Benicio Del Toro's character's parenting will bring up another man who makes the same mistakes? Is it right that Sean Penn's character leaves his wife? In 21 Grams there is no right and wrong, only the fearful symmetry of fate.

      Two weeks in and already we're settling into familiar routines. I've noticed that Courtney and I only really nag each other about two things (one each), apart from TV. I complain about her eating habits; without me around to cook for her she'd eat nothing but toast and takeaway. On the other hand she is dumbfounded by the way I happily wash my face with hand soap, or whatever's close to the basin, or just cold water. She tells me that there's a programme on TV in which gay men do lifestyle make-overs to straight men. One of the first things the gay blokes do (before they redecorate the straight bloke's house and throw out his clothes) is run into the bathroom and shriek about the lack of facial scrub.  It strikes me that our nagging of each other might reveal the root of the difference between European and American schools of thought. I, being European, think that all problems can be solved with food and a sensible approach to eating. Courtney, being American, thinks that all problems can be solved with the correct soap and a good amount of scrubbing. Guts vs face; Insides vs Exteriors; Digest vs purge. Stop me when you're bored, or if you think I'm spouting gibberish.  It's -10 Fahrenheit outside  again  today. That's 42 degrees Fahrenheit below freezing. When I finally convert these numbers into Celsius I'll be horrified, I'm sure.  I just did. It's -23 degrees Celsius. I  knew  it felt cold out there.

      This snow thing is still a novelty. It stopped snowing in the early hours of the morning and now the light breeze is knocking powdery flurries from the branches of the trees. It's distractingly pretty, and if it weren't below freezing outside I'd be wandering around gawping at it all.  Courtney and I saw the excellent  21 Grams  at  urlLink the Little  last night. I'll post some thoughts about it later. I also picked up a job application form. I wonder if they'd be willing to train me up as a projectionist? Ever since seeing Tyler Duerden's approach to projecting film in  Fight Club  I've quite fancied having a go myself.

      Main differences between US and UK supermarkets (that I've noticed so far):  1) They sell beer, but not wine or spirits. In some states (Massachusetts) they don't sell any booze at all. 2) There is a huge aisle in the freezer section specialising in ice cream, frozen yoghurt, etc. but the only frozen meat available is leftover turkeys from Thanksgiving. 3) Single cream and double cream are "Cream" and "Heavy Cream" respectively and are sold in handy measures of either half a pint or four pints. 4) Regular battery chicken eggs are bleached white, just like in Israel. 5) The only bacon on offer is streaky bacon. It's almost impossible to get hold of back bacon and to do so you have to ask for "Canadian Bacon."  Bizarrely, in the European cheese fridge I found a combination of Stilton and Double Gloucester (it's done in layers) called "Stilchester". Even more bizarrely, it's made in England.  As a Brit you also have to contend with the fact that certain foods reached America through different routes and will not necessarily have the same names. For example, what I call coriander was brought to the Americas by the Spanish and so everyone here calls it cilantro. Still, a keen eye, a good nose and the readiness to ask silly questions will just about see you through.  Apoologies to everyone for lack of email. I've written a whole bunch, but I'm having trouble getting my email program to send mail, even though it recieves perfectly. Go figure.

       urlLink I hope this is just selective reporting of a minor incident.  Norwich isn't exactly the most cosmopolitan of cities, but the fans did enthusiastically embrace the "Kick Racism Out of Football" campaign, so I'm a bit surprised that this should happen. Something definitely does need to be done about the "We Shoot Burglars" chant, though. I've heard it far too often (about twice in both matches I've been to this year) and it's not the kind of thing a good family club's supporters should chant.  It's all to do with psychotic Norfolk farmer, Tony Martin.  urlLink Here's the Mirror's tabloid take on him  and here's  urlLink the Grauniad's.    Clearly the man's a national hero, just like the Krays,  urlLink Nicholas van Hoogstraten  and Jeffrey Archer.

      I've got a few days (weeks?) of idleness before my Social Security number comes through and I get a job. I'm planning to use them well. I chomped through most of the Filth today, which I have on loan from Kelvin. I read the first few last year and was very impressed (mostly because it has quite a high tits and arse quotient if I'm being truthful) and I'm as impressed and even more confused having read to the end. Grant Morrison has lots to say about abjection and society's approach to transgressive behaviour and he says it as luridly as possible. Greg Feely is a confirmed bachelor with a comb-over, a ginger cat and a sizeable collection of porn under the mattress. One day he is visited by weird looking people who tell him he's not Greg Feely at all, but a bizarrely toupeed inter-dimensional binman, Ned Slade, agent of an organisation called the Hand. It is his job to clean up the messier, seedier and downright perverted side of human life. Through the twelve issues he battles against corrupted cell-sized organisms that force humans into perverted sex acts, giant flying sperm which fertilise women to death and a male US president with enormous breast implants and astonishing lapdancing skills. And at the end it seems Greg's simply been rolling around on his kitchen floor all the time.  There's some business involving agents of the Hand cleaning up comic books. They enter the two-dimensional space of the books, alter the course of the plots and then re-write the "Continuity Pages" so it seems nothing's amiss. At times it feels like the same has been done to the Filth. There are little elisions in the books. Tiny chunks go unexplained and at the end you feel like there was something at the edge of your vision all the way through; always there and never properly seen. Kelvin's missing an issue, so that might explain some of it, but the missing bits really are part of Morrison's style and scheme. I wonder if the Filth has its own continuity pages sitting somewhere waiting for release?  By hook or by crook I will get to the trashy soiled bottom of this one or my name's not Ted Mudd and I'm not wearing a lime green toupee over my unwashed comb-over.

      The plane touched down safely, my support group (Courtney, Kelvin and Meg) were waiting to coach me through the first 72 hours of acclimatisation and the shock news is... it's not all that bad over here.  I've already found a couple of places that feel welcoming. Cibon, down the road, has a poncey name, but it's quite a comfy drinking establishment and it plays jazz. The Little, Rochester's arthouse cinema (sorry, "Movie Theater") feels like the arthouse cinema I used to sell tickets for in Canterbury except it's got more screens, better decor and popcorn.  So, without further ado, my first movie review of the year: Bubba Ho-Tep. I find it best if I know absolutely nothing (or as little as possible) about a movie before I see it, hence I avoided everything I could before watching Kill Bill. I went in knowing it involved Uma Thurman in a yellow leather jumpsuit, some martial arts, and that it was directed by QT - so quite a lot really. I went in to Bubba Ho-Tep knowing it starred Bruce Campbell and had something to do with Elvis, JFK and Egyptian Mummies.  Sometimes knowledge is useful, sometimes it is simply baffling.  Lantern-jawed Campbell plays the King, who is ekeing out his lonely final years in a Texas retirement home, his days flashing past in a blitz of jump-cuts and hazy fades. Together with Ossie Davis' JFK (dyed black by the FBI and with bits of his brain replaced with bags of sand, apparently) they come to realise the ancient Egytpian mummy of Amon Ho-Tep is stalking the corridors of the rest home, keeping himself alive - albeit barely - by sucking the souls of the feeble inmates.  Campbell, after what seems like years of TV movies and blink-and-you-miss-him feature film cameos, grabs the role of the King with both hands, and although he's out-acted by Ossie Davis in the film's quieter moments, he comes into his own in the action sequences. When it comes to killing a scarab beetle with a bedpan and a two-bar electric fire no-one is better than Bruce. Not a soul. He gets his mouth around the old Elvis catchphrases cheekily littered through the film with the same relish as his "Hail to the King" stuff in the Evil Dead movies. Brucey is just like Elvis, a great big old ham cooked in Coca-Cola and served with a side order of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  But strip away the layers of ham and slapstick and Bubba Ho-Tep is a sad movie about two old men sliding towards death. JFK is not JFK. Elvis is not Elvis. He is a confused impersonator called Sebastian Haff. In their desperation to save their souls they forget to check who their souls belong to in the first place. As Elvis/Sebastian breathes his last breaths it is the soul of Elvis he is glad to have saved, not that of Sebastian Haff. Was there ever anything more than a myth to save in the first place?

      Courtney and I - in what must count as a shocking display of un-Americanism - went to see Bertolucci's  The Dreamers  last night. An intelligent and provocative film, the responses it squeezed out of the audience of twenty or so offered what I think is an insight into the collective consciousness of the nation.  Without spoiling the film for anyone who intends to watch it (and by all means  do ) it deals with the political scene in Paris in 1968, cinema, sex, and incestuous relationships through the eyes of three students. During one beautifully edgy disrobing I caught a nervous cough firing out from behind me. It was a mellow, deep, throaty cough; the kind of cough your Dad coughs. You'd expect the owner of this cough to have seen a thing or two. One would presume (he was there with a woman of similar age) he'd been married for many years and is no stranger to the sight of naked female flesh. He had also sought out an art house cinema and an  urlLink NC-17 rated film . Why, then, was he unnerved by a little post-pubescent petting?   The Dreamers  is not a comedy, but it has its comic moments. Courtney and I were the only ones laughing. Did people just not get it, or didn't they find it funny? No-one walked out in disgust, but the cinema drained pretty quickly as soon as the credits rolled. All of which leaves me wondering: is sex a taboo outside Los Angeles and New York?  In comparison, when Pasolini's  Salo  was re-released in the UK a couple of years ago I saw it in a packed cinema.  Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom  is far more graphic and very disturbing. It features killing, sexual humiliation, shit eating and torture. Certainly many sat in shocked silence through much of the film, but there was no awkward coughing. The audience stayed riveted until almost the final credit had rolled, and while they didn't leave the cinema in a jovial mood, they were talking animatedly. Clumps of them hung around in the cafe to dicuss it some more. There were many criticisms of the film, but no-one was unable to deal with what they'd just seen. There is a stark comparison between that audience of two years ago and the audience of last night.  I am waiting to be proved wrong, but right now I get the impression that the mainstream American attitude to depictions and discussions of sexual matters is analagous to that of a five year-old who blushes and covers his eyes when the couple in the old movie he's watching start to smooch.

       urlLink Britons 'spend more on alcohol than fruit and veg'  claims the Money section of the Guardian. What terrible news! We must be a nation of dispomaniacs!  1kg carrots = 60p, 1kg onions = 67p, 1 cucumber = 58p, total = 185p  1pt draught lager = 228p  (All average prices from  urlLink some office in Jersey )  If we were to spend  more  on fruit and veg than we do alcohol I estimate we'd need to eat an average of roughly three kilos of vegetable matter for every pint we drink.

      I finally watched  The King of Comedy  by Martin Scorsese last night. At the beginning of the 80's he directed two black comedies: this and  After Hours . Judging by the comments on the Internet Movie Database they're pretty widely misunderstood and underappreciated. Too many people fixate on  Mean Streets ,  Goodfellas ,  Casino  and  Taxi Driver . They expect every Scorsese movie to be about tough men doing tough things. It's true that a lot of Scorsese's movies are about male-dominated social structures: the Mafia (obviously), Jazz bands, sports and organised religion (Catholicism and Buddhism), but people who watch Scorsese films in lieu of getting a testosterone injection are missing out.  I imagine audiences at the time did not warm to Scorsese's comedies, and this explains why he hasn't made any since 1985. The blame should rest not only with the Scorsese=macho crew, but also with those who eschew delicate, sad and sometimes surreal and disturbing comedy for Adam Sandler pratfalls. I won't be taking Courtney to the cinema for  50 First Dates  on Valentine's day, for purely selfish (and probably elitist) reasons.

       Up til now this immigration business has been pretty daunting, but this is surely one deterrent too far. I went to get my Social Security number from the City Hall the other day. There are some windows and a waiting room which are about as threatening as a bank. There's a ticket dispenser which is about as threatening as a normal deli-counter. But all this is a cunning ruse to calm your suspicions, for when you take your ticket - that's when they catch you unawares!

      Today I read  urlLink Kelvin's  review of  The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . I saw the film a couple of weeks ago, loved chunks of it, admired the rest, and left feeling warm and happy inside - so I don't know if Kelvin saw the same film.    It wallowed in its cleverness, it wasn't nearly as funny as it thought it was, and like so many films today (especially of the "independent" sort) it quite obviously subscribed to the Happy Endings Are Bad school of thought as it dragged the plot kicking and screaming not to its logical end, but to a more cynical climax more acceptable to goatee-stroking film students.    Now, I'll concede that I am/was a goatee-stroking film student (but without the goatee), and offer a justification for films that don't end happily. Gus Van Sant, who has at times made baffling choices (shot-by-shot remake of  Psycho ?  Finding Forrester ?), was interviewed about his latest movie,  Elephant , in  Sight and Sound  the other month, and a lot of what he said made sense, including this, which seemed so pertinent I wrote it down in my little blue book.    In daily life in America there is always discontinuity. If you wander around or even go to a cohesive interaction like a party everything is made up of non-sequitirs. Things don't have beginnings and endings in our lives, and if you want to make storytelling lifelike, you have to play by the rules of reality, which is that nothing is connecting, nothing is making sense. It's like a Hobbesian world of people striving to get their next meal.   I've never subscribed to the Happy Endings Are Bad school of thought any more than I've subscribed to the diktat Films Must End Happily Because First And Foremost They're Entertainment. There's plenty of evidence to suggest that what are generally held to be the most unmuddied of happy endings are much less stable than we think. And there's plenty of evidence to suggest that  The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  didn't end sadly.  If you've not seen the film and want to keep the ending a surprise, read no further.  If the "logical end" that Kelvin claims the plot was dragged past is Joel and Clementine's meeting at Montauk Point, then I'd like to suggest that ending the film at that point would be cheating. When both Joel and Clementine's friends eventually see them together the business of the memory erasure would be mentioned to one or the other, and their unfortunate discovery would still occur. Their ignorance would not be any kind of defence against tragedy. The way the film progresses beyond this point is not cheating, and it thankfully doesn't waste time putting the audience through a soap opera style exposure of the truth.  It's only logical that after a process that is "essentially brain-damage" the participants should be frightened and scared. People suffering from concussion often cry because they're disoriented. Now imagine that someone you've just met, and are falling in love with, exposes you to a taped interview in which they are telling a stranger just how terrible a person you are. You're not likely to leap into their arms declaiming "Oh darling, you're so funny!" Of course you'd fall out, just like Joel and Clementine do. But  The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  doesn't end there. The film stops awkwardly outside Joel's apartment where he and Clementine could either get back together and make new memories of each other or go their separate ways. It's an  Italian Job  ending where everything hangs (figuratively rather than literally in this case) in the balance.  Of course, given what we've just seen there's no guarantee that the "Happy Ending" promised by their reunion would be happy at all. It could be miserable: their relationship has already failed once.  But this "ending" isn't forced upon us. The film stops before the story ends and the viewer is left to decide how she wants everything to wind up. It's a happy film or a sad film depending solely on your outlook.  While we all like to imagine that Michael Caine's idea to right the bus works, and the lads get away with the gold, somewhere in our hearts we know it's impossible; and that doesn't make  the Italian Job  a sad film.

      Last night Courtney and I took our first steps towards becoming twinkle-toed dancers for the inevitable season of weddings which loom on the calendar's horizon (sometime around June). Swing Dance for Beginners happened at the Twelve Corners Presbyterian Church in Rochester, and by God it's a sprawling edifice. I have decided all dance classes are essentially alike, but with regional variations. American can claim rights to two in particular: the first is the ever-present name tag, although thankfully they weren't pre-printed with "Hello, my name is." The second is that the instructors wear the kind of obvious microphone headsets reminiscent of late eighties Madonna or twenty-first century call centre workers.  They also had one of those cool CD decks beloved of club DJs which allow you to slow down the speed of the recording. If I hadn't been concentrating so hard on my feet I'd have been eyeing it enviously. And one, two, dou-ble-step, dou-ble-step.  They patiently took us through the basic step structure and I lost my way only once, although this did entail hopping around like Steve Martin in  the Jerk  with his honky rhythm deficiency, trying to get back on the beat. Still, no-one laughed. When I recovered I looked up and everyone else was doing the Steve Martin dance too. Several partners and a pair of moist armpits later (mostly from the stress of being watched by the more advanced class who had gathered at the back of the room) we were sent off into the night to argue with our partners about which of the other people we'd danced with we fancied. I got three hotties, Courtney just got old men.   Our Swing-themed night was rounded off with  Belleville Rendez-Vous  (or the  Triplets of Belleville ) at the Little. It's an inventive animation with an eye for the absurd, stereotypical and grotesque. It takes a range of potent cultural myths and throws them into the blender. Its only flaw it that it outsmarts itself at the climax by dissolving into a hackneyed chase that does not suit the genre.  Many people who have seen it have commented "I've never seen anything like it before. It's nothing like Disney!" This is true, but whoever said all animation had to be like Disney? There's a long tradition (more so, I think, in Europe) of animation and absurdism. Animated precedents for  Belleville Rendez-Vous  include the surrealist animation of Jan Svankmajer, Gosciny and Uderzo's  Asterix  and - possibly - the Brothers Quay. It also draws on the live-action exploits of Jacques Tati (did anyone spot the  M. Houlot  poster in the Triplets' apartment?) and adopts and absurdist tone throughout.  The music, like the visuals, are a heady hodge-podge, blending swing, blues, hot club (there's a brief appearance by an animated Django Reinhardt, whose hands are those of Mickey Mouse - a fantastic joke if you know anything about the reduced finger count of both characters), musique concrete and club music. I think it won an Oscar for best song, and quite right too.  I'm calling it  Belleville Rendez-Vous  because of the three official titles, that's the one that suits it best. The triplets are accomplices, not the main characters. I don't think that counts as a spoiler.

      For very little reason at all I've added to the music links on the left of the page. Now you too have the unique opportunity to find out what kinds of noise Courtney is subjected to when we're both in the apartment. For those with decent Flash support the Cinematic Orchestra's website has a very pleasant swirly interactive logo on the front page. I must have spent all of thirty seconds playing with it.  I think I'm just working myself up for the  urlLink Big Chill . Courtney and I booked our tickets yesterday. Three sun-soaked days of music and merrymaking on the Malvern Hills, you say? Oh yes. Yes indeedy.

      I've been catching up on my reading recently. At long last I've done what I've been promising myself for a good long while by picking up Courtney's copies of the  His Dark Materials  trilogy. Pullman is an absolutely spellbinding storyteller. I devoured the first two in about three or four days, but I underestimated how much reading I'd get done on holiday and left  the Amber Spyglass  at home. They've been reviewed and talked about so much that I've got nothing new to bring to the discussion, other than to say I was mightily pissed off at the end of the second book, and that I'd almost forgotten how satisfying non-realist, non-modernist, non-postmodern narratives can be.  Then I read another that everyone is talking about back home,  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time  by Mark Haddon. James brought it over for Courtney. It's a quick read (a quiet Sunday should get you through the bulk of it). What struck me is that it's essentially a kitchen-sink drama (and, yes, a detective story) transformed by being told through the eyes of a boy with Asperger's syndrome. This is the book's greatest achievement. By handing over the narration to the protagonist the illogic of his autistic behaviour is revealed to be very structured, patterned and motivated. The formalists aimed to create art that gave the spectator the chance to look at everyday life from a different perspective, and  the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time  does exactly that without feeling either gimmicky or worthy. If I were in a position to make such decisions I'd declare it required reading in high schools.  A good comprehensive review is on urlLink The Modern Word , which is a thoroughly decent website.  Yesterday I read a novella by  urlLink Mikhail Bulgakov  called  Heart of a Dog . A Russian scientist takes a stray dog and replaces his pituitary gland and seminary vesicles with those of a human. Over the course of a few days the perfectly adequate dog turns into an utterly deplorable man. Clearly it's not a scientific record, but a work of political satire. I wonder what it is with political satire and anthropomorphism? Bulgakov wrote the book in 1925, but it wasn't published in his native Russia until 1987. I don't know when his work was translated into English and whether or not Bulgakov, who died in 1940, had any influence on George Orwell. Either way it's an odd book, and feels a little like the Ibsen play  the Wild Duck , which I found very odd and very satisfying. In fact, the two playwrights shared a creative milieu; both had works produced at the Moscow Arts Theatre by Stanislavsky, and Bulgakov spent time there as a producer. I think I'm starting to understand.  And tonight I'll be cracking open the final volume of  His Dark Materials . I already had a quick peek at the preface: an excerpt from a Robert Grant hymn, a few lines of Rainer Maria Rilke and a chunk of John Ashbery. Best of all the first page opens with a line of Blake. Honestly, the trash they give kids to read these days makes me sick.

       I've really been neglecting this site for the last few weeks, but at least it's because I've been doing stuff. James' visit neatly co-incided with Courtney buying a digital camera, so here's a snap from our first of two days in NYC. Yes, we went skating at the Rockefeller Centre. Shut up. It was cool. The hostel was a bit crap (never stay at "Jazz on the Town", kids) but NYC was willing to perform its usual cabaret show for us. One of the highlights this time was seeing the dog enclosure in Washington Square Park, and then seeing the  tiny  dog enclosure for  tiny  dogs right next to it. I could happily live there. New York, that is, not the dog enclosure.  As is fast becoming habit we met up with Courtney's cousin Meri and her fiance, Jason, who are outstandingly hospitable and lovely, and I didn't embarrass myself too badly this time. I'm looking forward to our next NYC trip, whenever it may be.

      Time for a correction and a clarification. After posting my diatribe against these silly Yanks and their appropriation of foreign national holidays, Meg and Kelvin sent me this link to information about the  urlLink Cinco di Mayo .  So it's a kind of independence day, but not really. It's a repelling the French day, and is important to people all over the Americas. Apologies for not doing enough research, etc. I shall try harder in the future not to be a whingeing killjoy, honest.  However, I can still say without fear of contradiction that St. Patrick's Day in Rochester was a surreal experience.

      Yesterday was apparently Mexican Independence Day. The first I knew about it was when the girl who does my hair asked me what I was doing for "Cinco de Mayo," which Americans celebrate as the day Mexico rejected Spanish rule.  Why Americans celebrate another country's independence is perplexing in the first place, but even odder is that they haven't even got the right date. Mexican Independence day is actually  urlLink 16th September . I suspect the merrymaking and sombrero-wearing of last night was merely a cynical plot to offload a few bottles of Corona, and little else.  A little over a month ago there was St. Patrick's Day (or, as everyone here calls it, St. Patty's Day - who knew Patricia was a saint?). When I tried to order a Guinness the barman mistook my English accent and said "Hey, straight off the boat! I like that!" There was no point in correcting him (most Americans don't know the difference between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and think that the whole island is part of the UK). People were selling dyed-green carnations, which to my knowledge were symbols of the  urlLink aesthetic movement , most notably Oscar Wilde, and have never been a symbol of Irish nationalism. Why is America so keen to appropriate other people's cultures if it is only going to make a mockery of them?  I can't wait to see what happens here for  urlLink Bastille Day , which may be marked here on 14th July, or possibly some time in November, and will probably feature such authentic French specialities as  urlLink French Fries  and  urlLink French Toast .  (With apologies to the makers of  urlLink  Better Off Dead  )

      There are movies that you love because of their bravado, their "Sod-you!" accomplishment; movies like  Citizen Kane ,  A Clockwork Orange ,  The Royal Tenenbaums . There are movies you love because of their heartfelt authenticity and conviction; movies like  Kes ,  Wild Strawberries  and  The Son's Room . There are movies you love because they're breathtakingly fun and stylish; movies like  North by Northwest ,  Fight Club  and  Pulp Fiction .  And there are movies like  Anaconda , which are generic, uninspired, ersatz and leaden. I saw  Anaconda  at the age of 17, drunk and lairy, with a bunch of mates in the Worcester Odeon and I loved every minute. What made me fall so deeply in love with this piece of trash, this celluloid swindle? It wasn't the spectacle of Jennifer Lopez asking "Is it just me, or does the jungle make you really horny?". It wasn't the sight of Jon Voigt's dirty-old-man leer. It wasn't Ice Cube bellowing "We don't know shit about the shit we're in!". It wasn't even the comedy Englishman dispatching a baddie with a 9-iron and the war-cry "There's an arsehole in one!" It was all these moments and more. A cornucopia of hyper-real movie logic, sketchy exposition and bad special effects,  Anaconda  will live unsullied in my memory as the most unintentionally, gloriously silly movie I've ever seen.  On June 7th, James sent me an email. How I managed to avoid reading it for a month I don't know, but today I did, and this is what it said.   Just when you thought it was safe to venture back to the b-movies...   urlLink http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/anacondas/index.html   Leering; bad puns; atrocious acting - all guaranteed!   Seven years later - a sequel! No matter that the original was a stinking pile of dung that sank without trace. Presumably the executives behind this are hoping that the law of dimishing returns will somehow be turned on its head by this re-run in which scientists travel to the depths of the Borneo jungle in search of - oh! - a mysterious orchid which holds the secret of eternal youth. I only hope it's out in the UK when Courtney and I are back in August so I can return to the scene of the crime to see its sequel.  I especially like that it's called  Anacondas . You can almost hear the studio execs: "Ah yes, it worked for  Alien  and  Aliens , and they were good movies, so why can't it work for us?"

      When I created this webpage, way back whenever, I did it for two reasons:  1) I was trying to find ways of keeping amused that weren't going out to the Cardinal's Hat, the Three Kings, the Apple Tree or the Swan with Two Nicks, and that would keep me writing, even if it was just a line or two here and there about formalist films by dead Russians.  2) I knew I would be leaving the country, and I wanted something on the web which would, at the very least, remind my family and friends of what I look like.  It turns out that this weblog had a third reason for being, which at the time was known only to the Fates.  I spent the first twenty-four years of my life not knowing my biological father.  The events surrounding my birth would make a perfect Thomas Hardy plot, and so for various, tragically avoidable reasons Duncan was not around when I was born.  Mum had told me about him since I was old enough to speak and listen, and while I grew up happy and content knowing that I had one father who loved me and provided for me, I knew that there was another father in another town, maybe another country, whose blood I shared. I often wondered what else I shared with him. Did we look alike? Behave alike? Did I have his smile, his laugh?  When I was eighteen my parents told me that, as an adult, I was legally able to search for Duncan and make contact. Mum knew his parents - my grandparents - lived in the same house as they had when she knew him. All I needed to do was walk up to their gate, but for the past seven years I couldn't bring myself to do it. What if Duncan didn't want to know me? What if he was married to a woman who didn't know his past? I thought about the meeting many times, running it over in my head, but I hesitated at the point of action. Who knows what kind of an incident I could have caused?  About two months ago the twenty-four years of silence were broken. On the last day of our holiday in Florida I checked my email. Among the usual offers of free money from Nigerian businessmen, Vicodin, weight loss and penis gain tablets, was an email from a girl called Cate Graham with the subject "Half Brother?"  A couple of stiff drinks later I replied to her email. The things she knew about me were correct. Out of nowhere I had a half-sister. I hoped it wasn't a cruel hoax or a practical joke. The next day, back at our apartment in Rochester, I hooked up the laptop and checked my email again. Another email from Cate. If I was happy to correspond with her, would I mind if my other sisters wrote too?  Other sisters?  Yes, there are two, Sinead and Rhianon.  Cate, do your parents know you've been in touch?  Yes.   A couple of days later, the expected email from Duncan arrived. A few days after that the subject of meeting up was broached. On June 3rd I stepped off a plane at Heathrow terminal 4 into the arms of my lost-and-found family. It's been a very strange, exciting and fulfilling few weeks. I was an only child from a small family. Now I have an extra father, a kind-of-stepmother, three half-sisters, a set of grandparents and a host of aunts, uncles and cousins, all of whom I'm sure will be mentioned here eventually. And, in a certain mood, under the right light, my biological father and I  do  have the same smile.     From left to right: Lynne, Rhianon, Caitlin, Sinead, Duncan.    So, how did Duncan eventually find me? After years of calling various organisations, searching through records, asking friends of friends who lived in the town where I was born, and checking  Friends Reunited  and making no progress the solution was deceptively simple: on a whim he googled my name and found this site. OK, so there aren't millions of Liam Creightons, but there are quite a few. Try this: go to Google, type my name into the little box and click on "I'm Feeling Lucky." You'll get this website. The only reason that happens is because more people have read this page than any other that contain the words "Liam Creighton".  So, who is to thank for this happy ending? Lots of people, but right now I want to thank everyone who's ever looked at this silly little website. Those hits made everything easier. Hurrah for the internet. Hurrah for blogging. Hurrah for my conviction that what I write is worth reading. And hurrah to you for reading it!  Cheers.

      Even if you were  for  the war in Iraq, you have to admit this is definitely very shoddy behaviour. Next time someone tells me that they refuse to see  Fahrenheit 9/11  because it wouldn't be showing support for the troops (and someone I know did use this incoherent argument) I'm going to tell them about this: Discontent in the ranks [of the US military] has also been stoked by reports that life insurance sales agents have been using compulsory financial planning sessions with raw recruits to sell them expensive policies.  An investigation by the New York Times found that many of the soldiers who signed policies had no idea what they had bought, believing that signing the documents was obligatory and that they were agreeing only to put aside savings. In fact, they had agreed to pay inflated monthly premiums for less coverage and benefits than the standard package offered by the army.  Source:  urlLink The Guardian   The  urlLink NYT article is here  (and requires you to register with the site). Apparently the scam has been commonplace since Vietnam, but has naturally had a recent surge.  If you haven't heard of  urlLink bugmenot.com , now might be the time to try it out. Go there, type in the address of the site you want to view (but can't be bothered to register with) hit return, and the bugmenot database will provide you with a username and password valid for that site.

      It's a bright summer day and as I sit by the front window of the apartment reading &quot;The Art of Dramatic Writing&quot; I can hear a distant trumpeter practising the opening bars of the  Godfather  theme. I wonder what music played at Marlon Brando's funeral?

          As you can see from this picture, the camping trip was no washout. A little thunder, a lot of insect bites, a spot of walking, plenty of good company and verdant countryside. On Saturday we ate lunch on a rocky outcrop overlooking the simply-named Lake #4. Left to right: Amie, Laura, me. Behind the camera: Courtney.     I have decided the Adirondacks are NY's Lake District. Many of their attributes compare favourably, save the names. Lakes #1-6 are no match for the likes of Derwent Water, Grasmere and Windermere. Can you imagine Wordsworth writing a poem titled &quot;Lines Left on a Tree Stump Overlooking Lake #4,&quot; or &quot;For The Spot Where The Hermitage Stood on Island #6, Lake #2?&quot;  There is no prize for identifying the Wordsworth poem I culled the title for this post from, but have a go anyway. Now I have email to do. I feel as if haven't emailed  anyone  for a couple of weeks.  I passed the driving test, by the way. The instructor said I had a &quot;touch of the cowboy&quot; to me, and I wasn't even wearing the hat.

      A couple of friends and Courtney and I are heading off into the Adirondack mountains tomorrow.  Here's the  urlLink weather forecast  for the area. We're going have lots of fun this weekend. I must remember to pack my waterproof everything.    Oh, and I've got my utterly redundant US driving test tomorrow too. If I fail I'll probably die of shame before I get soaked to the skin and frazzled by lightning.

      I'd sworn off these things, but... well... it's Eddie.     urlLink     Which Eddie Izzard line are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I just saw  urlLink this article  on boingboing, the directory of wonderful things. I must admit that if next time I enter the US I am treated with the same unmannerly way as last time, I'll be tempted to take similar action myself.  Of course, Mr. Miller was simply going through the metal detector. I'd like to know what he'd do when confronted by US immigration.  How squeamish is this  urlLink Yahoo News report  of the story? "Pants area," indeed. What's wrong with "groin?" And what was the "expletive" in the man's bag?

        More animal oddity at the Eastman House. There are similar horses dotted around Rochester, including one with a buffalo mane. This is the best of the bunch.

       urlLink George Monbiot  delivers a perceptive and persuasive article in the Guardian about a &quot;scruffy comedian from Michigan.&quot; I think I'd like to borrow his words - because they're more eloquent and better researched than my own - to illuminate my response to Fahrenheit 9/11.  Using my own words once more; the best account I've ever read (if you know of better, please let me know) of the dirty business of fighting in wars and the propaganda machine that reports those wars back to the public is George Orwell's  Homage to Catalonia . In early editions of the book, chapters five and ten are analyses of the European press coverage of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939 (in later editions these chapters become appendices). Orwell checked through issues of newspapers from the far left, the far right, and all those in between to discover how their versions tallied with his personal experience of fighting against the fascists as a volunteer. He discovered that almost all reports, from the communists to the fascists, and on the very far right, the Daily Mail, were complete fabrication. Interestingly, in a footnote he remarks: I should like to make an exception of the  Manchester Guardian . In connection with this book I have had to go through the files of a good many English papers. Of our larger papers, the  Manchester Guardian  is the only one that leaves me with an increased respect for its honesty.  On the whole, I think the editorial stance of the Guardian today bears favourable comparison, although I did notice some inconsistencies in the reporting of the first few weeks of the most recent Iraq war.  I was mildly surprised to hear that Ray Bradbury, author of classic sci-fi novel  urlLink  Fahrenheit 451   was furiously displeased with Michael Moore's hijacking of his title. I'd have thought that Bradbury's politics would have been broadly similar to those of Moore's. The full interview is on the website of Swedish paper  urlLink Dagens Nyheter , but I can't find any complete translations, only heavily editorialised presentations of carefully selected snippets. If anyone comes across an entire translation, please let me know, as I'd be interested to read it. Certainly, Moore's appropriation of the title is somewhat clumsy, but does this qualify him as a &quot;horrible human?&quot;

      As I was looking for information on Spike Lee's new movie,  She Hate Me  (the wonderful  urlLink Chiwetel Ejiofor , who played Okwe in  Dirty Pretty Things  has a role) I was unfortunate enough to read the  urlLink imdb review . I have a love/hate relationships with the imdb reviews. They're like car crashes - awful, but you can't stop looking. This particular review is glib and generalised, but not a huge offender - until the final sentence.  Although it will open after Roger Moore's more publicized documentary, attacking the President, make time to enjoy this treasure! Would this be Roger Moore, the man who admits "I might not be as good an actor as  Sean Connery  Lawrence Olivier, but I'm taller," or Roger Moore, the political satirist and documentary maker? I love his no-nonsense interviews: "I'm aiming directly at your groin, so speak now or forever hold your peace" (20 Junkopia points awarded to the first person - Courtney excepted - who can name the movie this quote comes from).  As Dave asked so nicely in the comments, yes, Courtney and I (and a couple of friends) saw Michael "Roger" Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  and came away feeling pumped up and pissed off. It's a documentary that aims for emotional response rather than intellectual engagement, as does all of Moore's work (Michael's and Roger's too, I guess). I can't imagine the same style being used in a European political documentary. We didn't stay til the end of the credits, but I hope there was a bibliography on display. Even if there isn't, Moore lists all his  urlLink facts and sources on his website .  Of course, I didn't go into the movie waiting to be convinced. I already knew that Bush is a lying, cheating liability, whose malign influence has damaged both the US and the rest of the world. He needs to be removed from office before he does further harm. But Bush isn't the problem: he's just the biggest symptom. There's a lot in the USA that needs to change. Sure, tackle one issue at a time. Get rid of Dubya, but once that's done there's still a lot more work to do.  I don't agree with all of Michael Moore's politics and methods, but Fahrenheit 9/11 is important because it's a high-profile movie which has galvanised and unified the American left. In the face of at flood of spin and obfuscation that is American political journalism this particular movie stands firm.  And I just realised my closing metaphor makes quite a good pun on the documentarist's name.

        Terror hit the formal gardens of the ex-residence of the ex-captain of industry, ex-founder of Kodak and general ex-eccentric, George Eastman this afternoon. Terrorist spores, which it is suspected had been launched from Northern Korea and lain dormant for several weeks, grew at a blistering pace into lumbering tentacled carnivo-plants. Hundreds of them hurled themselves at the walls of the Eastman House, an American institution, in an attempt to spread fear and panic in the run-up to the Presidential election. Courageous locals armed with pitchforks and weedwhackers attempted to stem the tide of vegetable viciousness, but  to no avail. Many were pulled from the clashes covered in sap. At the moment it is not clear how many lives have been lost, but the final number is widely expected to be higher than the redundancies announced by Kodak earlier this year.  In the light of these events, President Bush has declared a &quot;war on nature&quot; which will commence with the burning and felling of dark wood trees all around the country. Responding to claims that his surname suggests he was in some way involved with the plant life insurgency, the President said &quot;I am in no way, and never have been a vegetable, nor have I ever had relations with a vegetable. I ain't got no magic beans, neither.&quot;  Courtney and I  finally  visited the  urlLink Eastman House  today. It's very good. Cameras from all eras including one that looked like a cannon and some lovely Leicas; a world travel themed photograph exhibit with some great snaps by  urlLink Robert Doisneau  and  urlLink Martin Parr  in particular; the formal gardens, which are currently in full bloom; and the house, a good quantity of which is preserved almost exactly as it was when George Eastman was alive. I swear the man was slightly eccentric. Anyone who regards this as suitable decor for a conservatory is a couple of banana trees short of a plantation.     And we rounded it all off with a screening of  urlLink  The Ghost and Mrs Muir  , a Joseph Mankiewicz melodrama with a stirring soundtrack from Bernard Hermann, in which the ghost of an old sea captain (Rex Harrison) dictates a book of memoirs called &quot;Blood and Swash&quot; to a young widow (Gene Tierney). Marvellous.

      The pictures of the Hopf family Independence Day turkey-fry are now online. I've given them their own gallery in the photos section.  urlLink Click here to have a look at the scariest method of cooking a large bird I've ever seen.   Before we cooked the bird I convinced Courtney's sister Maggie that the turkey wasn't fully defrosted and that because hot oil and water don't mix there was a good chance the turkey fryer would launch it, like a ball of flame, at the house. I'm proud to report she was genuinely worried that her home was minutes away from burning down.  Of course, deep fried turkey wasn't the only bizarre food consumed this July 4th.  urlLink Kelvin  had some kind of multicoloured bagel monstrosity - for breakfast, no less.

      ...and very compelling. Nagl, over at  urlLink Falling Sky  points the way to some fantastic  urlLink Polish movie posters . From the look of this one for David Cronenberg's  the Fly , the artist who created it saw the same things in the film as I did. There's a really sexy one for  Dirty Dancing  too, sexier than the actual movie by about 20&deg; C.

      I decided the old design of the weblog was starting to creak a bit - it was nearly two years old, dang it! So I tinkered a bit today. I hope it all works well and looks good. If you spot any problems, let me know.  The comments will now be handled nice and elegantly by Blogger, so to comment on posts in the future, click on &quot;comments.&quot; I'll be disabling the old comments system in a couple of weeks, so don't click &quot;respond&quot; to leave comments. OK?

         Just a quick post to keep things bubbling while I work on the turkey frying pictures. Another Park Ave shot, the house across the road has dollar bills glued to the pavement (sidewalk) out front. I've not seen a single person fooled in six months.

      The official period of mourning is now over, but everything was still at half-mast on Friday when Courtney and I visited the  urlLink Port of Rochester Ferry Terminal . Everything that looks like a flag, at least. While checking the place out we caught sight of this:     I can  just  about understand a large number of Americans wanting to mourn Ronald Reagan,  urlLink the ketchup-loving ones  especially, but I'm doubtful that Canadians give two hoots that the old fool kicked the bucket.  Then again, the Maple Leaf appears to be flying at somewhat less than half-mast. Perhaps there's some law which dictates that no flag of a foreign nation on US soil is permitted to fly higher than the Stars and Stripes. I wouldn't be surprised.

      ...that people do to celebrate American Independence Day, this deserves some kind of prize. Courtney's parents have decided to investigate the worrying trend that is sweeping the States: the deep-fried turkey. I am terrified at the prospect. What next? Deep-fried cow?  What's wrong with a nice bit of battered haddock?  Worst thing is, if the turkey isn't properly defrosted the deep fryer will launch it into orbit, or so I'm told. I'll try to get pictures.

      During my last visit back to the Shire, Dom noted that I had changed from being plain-and-simple "Liam" to "Porky Liam." Much as I like the idea of this as my superhero alter-ego, I don't fancy it as my normal human state.  There are plenty of things to blame my spare tyre on: American sized portions and the fact that as a child I had to clear my plate before leaving the table; the cold, cold winter; the six months forced unemployment that kept me indoors. Oh, there are many sad, pallid, bloated excuses I can make for my increasing girth, none of which cut the mustard - or my weight.  Courtney has noticed a similar ballooning around her waistline, which started with my arrival and her switch away from a toast-only diet. Now, with the arrival of summer, and the moderate certainty we'll be able to leave the house without getting snowed on, she has decided we're to start running off the fat. Tonight I expect we'll raid the wardrobe to find a semblance of a jogging outfit for me. I don't do sports clothing, so the results should be interesting, and probably bloggable.  But right now it's time for lunch. A 14" Italian sub sandwich with lettuce, black olives, Swiss cheese, spicy mustard and hot peppers from Wegmans should just about sort me out...
