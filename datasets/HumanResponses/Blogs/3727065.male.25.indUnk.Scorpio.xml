      I don't know about the title just thought I'd come up with something. Whether it's appropriate or not, I guess you'll have to be the judge of that. There's not a lot to report today. I've decided to start back to school sometime in the very near future. I'd like to think it's this fall, but depending on how quickly I can get everything together it may end up having to be in the spring. I've decided to get an M.B.A. so that as I progress in life if my career decides to take a different turn I'll be equipped to do something besides just work in a church. I sincerely love my job and there is nothing I would rather be doing right now, but I don't know if it will always be that way, so I feel like I should be prepared. Aside from working in a church, my Religion degree from Huntingdon College is only good for "do you want fries with that". Anyhow, school hopefully looms nearby.   I kind of want to write about what's going on in my friend group right now, but I think I'm going to save that one. I do love my friends and even if they tick me off they are still my friends, and I don't want to do anything to hurt them. Well I guess it's time to get back to work, and get ready for Wednesday night activities. More to come later!

      ...if you don't know what the whole "cha cha" thing is all about, all I can say is stop reading this immediately and go watch the newscast scene in Bruce Almighty where Steven Carrell's character is being messed with by Jim Carrey's character.   Ok, now that you are back we can forge ahead in this jungle that is my senseless writings. I got back today from a weekend at the beach with the guys, and I have to say I am exhausted, but as they say at Spring Bleach "this is the best night of my life". I had a great time just being away and not having to really be responsible for anything, and get back to my basic male silliness routine (if only for a few days). When it comes down to it, it is just great and completely therapeutic to laugh out loud and giggle like a little girl for no apparent reason (okay maybe there's an apparent reason or two laying around). I had a great time hanging out, jumping off the porch, battling the waves, making classic cinema, seeing weather phenomena that have never been recorded before (still haven't...sorry Rush), dancing, laughing, and so much more. So before I pass out I have to say "here's to Spring Bleach '05" and to Jay, Rush, and Andy..."you f#@$%rs are alright"!!

      Time for a shift in blog focus. I started one with the competition and I guess they all work the same, but maybe if I start over I will be motivated to keep up with it more, and write better stuff. If you want a peek at the old one it is www.xanga.com/nickmielke78 I probably won't write on it anymore, but check out what little is there.   This is where I write. Whether I do it all the time or not, I really do enjoy writing. I like being creative and having commentary about stuff that matters (although my commentary does tend to lean on the sarcastic funny side). I really enjoy reading and writing stuff similar to what Tony Kornheiser writes in the Washington post (check him out if you don't know what I'm talking about). So with that it's on to the writing.   Went to the movies last night with Jessie to see "The Terminal". I thought it was pretty good. Rollingstone gave it 2 stars (don't let that sway you, Rolling Stone never likes much of anything--but then again they reviewed Spiderman 2 and it got 3.5 stars so go figure). It was an interesting story about an international man trapped at JFK Airport because his country went to war and had an political uprising while he was in flying to the states(based on a true story of an Iranian man trapped in the Paris Airport).  The man can't leave the airport because he technically doesn't have a country since his is in the process of governmental change. The arcs in the story are his relationship to a relationally-challenged flight attendant who keeps falling for guys who are trouble, and also his purpose for being in New York in the first place (I won't ruin it for you). This movie speaks a lot about commitment, and it shows that it is still a good thing not only to make commitments, but more importantly to honor them. The movie isn't not all fluff that you expect it might be, but definitely worth watching.  Alright, I'm sure that's more than enough for right now, I'm at work and need to get busy. Leave some comments and stuff!

      Whoo boy.&nbsp;What better cliche way to start an entry about being busy than with a good hearty "whoo boy"? Actually I'm sure there are plenty of better ways. Oh well. Things are busy right now, and I am pretty much ready for the summer to be over with so that my schedule will become a little more regular.&nbsp; And it is official I am in a "blog drought" right now. The well is dry and I need some topics. So my only request on the "Comment Line" is leave me some ideas of stuff to write about. Funny is always best, but I can go the serious route if need be. Now as they say in radio "I'll hang up and listen".

      That's right boys and girls, it's a new segment on ye olde blog called "What the hell?". This is where I take various tidbits of news, knowledge, and information and use them as fodder for my infinite wit and commentary.&nbsp; With the exception of the Nicholas Sparks comments, all of the following stories can be found on Yahoo! News. So without further adieu...   -The Associated Press reported earlier this week that Michael Jackson is going to father quadruplets.&nbsp;  Now the fact that Michael Jackson is even allowed to have a thought that pertains to children just absolutely boggles the mind. I mean this guy should have a V-Chip, that blocks out anything pertaining to little kids, surgically welded to his brain. But I guess we can't blame him. If average Joe American was about to go on trial for child molestation, he would get some woman pregnant with 4 kids just to prove he doesn't have a weird thing for them too.   -Nicholas Sparks is a raving lunatic idiot that should be made to watch crazy people try to make a piano out of tapioca pudding for the rest of his life. I mean here's an idea write a book that's happy and someone doesn't die in. Jessie has read 4 of his books over the last few weeks, and everyone of them reduces her to an emotional little pile of crying-ness (yeah that's right "crying-ness"). I don't get it. Is this how this guy picks up women (he could be married I guess) "hey I'm a normal looking guy that writes books for a living, come read one and you'll be depressed and crying". Lighten up a little for crap's sake.   -JUST IN: Michael Jackson denies rumors that he is fathering quadruplets. Well thanks a lot Mike now you've just ruined my first little rant up there. Oh well he's still a freak that needs a lot of quality time with a padded room.   -Sign of the Times: Knife-Resistant Garb for Kids"  While I know there is some serious tones behind this story (children being attacked in Japan), it also begs the: What else could we make our clothing resistant to? I personally would like to see some IRS proof slacks, or maybe a "cheek pinching relative" proof hat. The possibilities are endless. After all if that little black box can survive the crash why don't we make the whole plane out of the little kids that wear the knife resistant coat?   -Bigger Breasts for Free: Join the Army  All I can say is there is going to be an increase in Strippers that can decaptitate you with the lid to a can of pork and beans, and transsexuals who can assemble and assault rifle in less than a minute. God Bless America!   and finally...   -The tallest Nationality is...  ...the Dutch. That's right boys and girls our little wooden shoe wearing, windmill having, opium growing (?) friends in Deutchland are on average the tallest people on the planet. Which makes me wonder where are the shortest people on the planet?&nbsp; I guess we'll never know.    Ok boys and squirrels that's all for this inaugural edition of "What the Hell?" leave me some love and I'll come up with something better for next time.

      Here I am. I don't really know what to say at the moment. Nothing is wrong in my life. Nothing bad has happened. I just appear to momentarily be in a slump of nothing all that funny to say (yes I hear you all saying that it's never really that funny--back off). I feel like maybe I'm in the episode of Knight Rider (anyone born after 1984 can stop reading now...you won't remember) when K.I.T.T. was painted white and it caused him to lose all his abilities (save for the ability to talk), and without the ability to jump buildings do complex computer like things, and make David Hasslehoff look cool outside of Germany (no small task I might add), I have to ask what good is a talking Trans-Am. Not a lot unless you live south of the Mason-Dixon and your hair is considerably longer in the back than the front. &nbsp; Maybe this is like the time on Dukes of Hazaard&nbsp;(people under 20 yrs. old you lose again)&nbsp;when Bo and Luke conveniently left Hazaard County for a while and their cousins Coy and Vance showed up and just didn't have the same flavor&nbsp;&nbsp;that the original Duke boys did. &nbsp; Or maybe this is like the time that Superman gave up saving people and became a staggering drunk with the 5 o'clock shadow and the ability to thump peanuts at whiskey bottles just because he was Superman and "what are you gonna do about it?". Ok so maybe it's not really like this one at all, but I thought I was getting somewhere for a minute.  &nbsp; Alright, well enough of this time wasting...maybe I'll go do something productive like come up with a new television series where every week the hero has lost his powers due to something hairbrained, but he always gets them back just as the episode ends, but you never find out what exactly it is he does. The hope of one day finding out in the Series Finale will bring the people back episode after drippy-cliche episode. You can send the awards to my agent (side note: I am now looking for an agent to represent me, receive my awards and accolades and later screw me out of a lot of money so I can be on E! True Hollywood Story).

      I thought about titling this "Everything I needed to know I learned at VBS", but I thought "how trite, and cliche".&nbsp; Not that it&nbsp; matters a bit, but that's still what we are going to talk about today boys and girls. Tonight wraps up&nbsp;a fun filled week of VBS at good ole FUMC in Millbrook, and what a week it was. The theme for the week (and consequently every other VBS in the world) was Lava Lava Island "where Jesus' love flows". I don't know if the nice people at Group Publishing spent much time in science class, but that would lead a thinking man such as myself to also believe that "Jesus' love burns through all things and leaves a molten path of destruction in it's wake", but surely that can't be right. As director of all of the Lava Lava Games this week I had plenty of opportunities to make various and asundry observations. So, in the spirit of the post before this one, I have a small list of my observations for you. &nbsp; a) For an elementary aged child, a finger up the nose creates the same sense of invisibilty that adults get in the car when they do the same thing (we ALL see you) b) In the minds of jr. high aged "helpers" the words "let's finish this last game and then you can have a waterfight" actually translates into "let's pour this entire bucket of water on someone in the youth building RIGHT NOW" c) During singing time the kids have a sixth sense ability to lower their incredibly loud singing at the exact moment as the sound guy when he tries to cut out the music to see how loud they are actually singing (they must have all seen Spiderman 2 many times and acquired that there spidersense) d) No you&nbsp;CANNOT make it through a week of VBS without someone puking on the floor right outside MY OFFICE e) Yes you can get a 6 inch piece of duct tape completely embedded in the hair of the innocent young 5 year old sitting next to you f) You can also tell the kids who will be artsy or opium addicts later in life as they are the ones who hear all the directions to the games, ask a clarifying question about them, and when the game begins they run around the entire gym in a circle until they fall down g) When you walk through wal-mart/drive in your car with 30 of those foam pool noodles, people give you lots of strange looks and ask lots of dumb questions ("Do you work at the YMCA?" or "You gonna do some swimming later?" i'm not sure that last one wasn't a pick up line) h) You can make up a lot of games based on natural disasters (volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, etc...) and apparently get paid money for it too (well played you Group VBS writers you) &nbsp; Well I'm sure you get the point. I am now opening up the floor for some new VBS material themes and ideas that we can start working on for next year and corner the market on elementary christian madness (Lane I feel a t-shirt tie in). Who's with me? &nbsp; Side note: As I'm typing this post I notice at the bottom where I can change the time and date to reflect that of my choosing. As my old friend Steve Boston used to say "I'm shocked yet mildly excited". I knew that my day in the time traveling&nbsp; universe was coming soon, but somehow I expected it would be a bit more glamorous. I mean there's no DeLorean, no magical Phone Booth with George Carlin inside, but it's time travel none-the-less. H.G. Wells would be pleased. So I'm really outta here this time, but I think I'm gonna try yesterday again.

      Hello boys and girls. A wise man once said "Life moves pretty fast, and if you don't stop and look around once in a while you might miss something". But then again that wise man also backed a Ferrari out of a plate glass window into a ravine, so go figure!  I don't really know where any of that came from, but don't worry I'm back now. I took my puppy (Bailey) to Union Springs today to start 5 weeks of obedience training this morning, and I'm very excited. She'll come back and be a whole new person..er..dog. It got me to thinking though, if I'm going to be paying this gentleman to train my dog I think perhaps I should be able to make a short but concise list of things that the dog could do for me to make my life a little easier (I mean while he's at it). As I pondered my list I thought I'd throw a few of them out there for the general public to ponder.   1) Feed herself, I mean who am I Benson? 2) Clean up after my brother who is living with me this summer (he can't manage it himself) 3) Learn to get those stupid little stickers off that they seal new CD's with 4) Search out any stray cobwebs in the yard so I don't find them at 9:30 at night and run screaming down the drive trying to get them off 5) Plan MYF every once in a while 6) Call my friends and help them keep in contact with me, because I'm obviously incapable of pulling it off on my own 7) Learn a trick that could get me on Letterman 8) Be in charge of taping all the good shows that I always forget about when I'm not home 9) Make friends with Jennifer Anniston's dog (then I'll have a connection) 10) Use the toilet, and flush, I mean is it that hard? Every other human on the planet does it (except for that guy the made stinky on the airplane food cart that time)  It's really a small insignificant list of things that Bailey could learn. I mean it's really time she started pulling her own weight around here (and at 5 1/2 months and 35 pounds there is weight to be pulled). After all John F. Kennedy said "ask not what you can do for you dog, but what your dog can do to deal with it's own crap once in a while". Bailey, I miss you and remember my name is "Your Royal Awesomeness".

      Ah Monday. Of all the days of the week, it's one of them.  Today was an somewhat exciting day as I got to put my new coffeemaker to use. I love coffee, but never usually brew it for myself because well I live by myself and I won't drink a whole pot, and it just seems like too much of a hassle to deal with. Well yesterday thanks to the great achievements in Coffee Technology I bought a coffeemaker that brews one or two cups of coffee (my choice) and it brews them straight into one of those spiffy little brushed aluminum go-cups that were all the rage about 3 years ago (hey I never claimed to be up to date on my trends). So I brewed 14 quality ounces of World Market's "Texas Turtle" coffee (which I ground in the store myself I might add)which blends the refreshing flavors of caramel, pecans, and chocolate. Because we all know that Texas is famous for it's turtles? As I drove to work this morning I was listening to my newest CD purchase "The Black Album" by my homeboy and yours Jay-Z and I have to say I'm digging it. I really feel more in touch with the streets as I drive through rural central Alabama sipping my gourmet flavor morning "go juice". I'm feel fairly certain that most of Jay-Z's days start much like mine do (feeding the dog, watching the cows off the back porch, driving down the gravel drive on the way to work, passing the trailer with the giant Mexican flag on the front, the list goes on...). That's the real street life right there. So Jay I'm feeling you dawg, and I've got an extra coffee cup with your name on it, so bust a move on down to the 334 and I'll hook you up "Texas Turtle" style. I may have 99 problems, but a single cup coffee maker ain't one.  Peace

      Don't really know why that line is in my head at the moment, but hey what better way to kick off some random talk than with something Jack Nicholson said sometime to some person about some thing.   I haven't posted in a good week or so because I've been gone. What? Gone you say? Wherever could I have gone? Was I out on safari on the savannahs of Africa in search of the elusive Nigerian Tiger-Monkey, or perhaps I was out secretly helping my country by skiing down a slope in Norway being chased by machine gun totin' 'wegians on my way to jumping off a cliff and opening a parachute bearing the stars and bars, or perhaps I was filling in for Joe Perry as Aerosmith tours in Japan because word on the street is that he and Stevie T are having some marital issues. Truth be told I was doing all of those things, but that was actually the week before last. Last week I was roofing a house. Yep no funny business there, just flat out "Alabama heat-tar sticking-shingle toting-thumb hammering-felt papering-rooftop madness". I was at a little thing we call Mission in Montgomery, and it was pretty good. We worked Mrs. Tyree's house and it was a situation where those who surveyed the house ahead of time obviously had no idea how bad it actually was, because I'm really very certain that every beam in her house is rotten. If the house is still standing in 5 years it'll be a miracle equivalent to the Baldwin brothers not being lined up before a firing squad and taken out in one fell swoop. But I digress.  It was basically just the typical mission trip motif of "it's eye-opening to see how other people live and how nice I actually have it", but the difference is I didn't go to the Congo or to help the lost tribes of Mt. St. Helens, I was here at home in good old "Fungomery". These people were living in a house where there was nothing on some walls standing between outside and inside. It's just very sad. I know we helped out a lot, by doing the small amount of work that we did, but it's also a pseudo-crappy feeling to leave and not have finished all the work they initially set out for us. I don't know where I'm going with this, but I'm really tired, and all of a sudden my brain shut off and I'm starting to not concentrate anymore. Guess it's time to practice for my future. Did I mention I'm going to be the world's next great "Texas Hold'em" phenom. Well consider the announcement made. See you at Binion's.

      What? Where am I? Oh yeah the blog. I guess when you slack off as long as I have and don't keep up you start to forget these things (especially at the ripe old age of 25). But I'm back for more cash so let's get started shall we? My dear friend lane who I like to call "The Summer Movie Maven" (so he's not a girl...sue me) reviewed several movies a while back and I saw one that I thought I would throw into the fray. Jessie and I went to see "SuperSize Me" the documentary about the gentleman (Morgan Spurlock) who ate nothing but McDonald's for 30 days, 3 meals a day. First of all as a kid this was what dreams were made of. It could only have gotten better if I could have brushed my teeth with ice cream, and wiped with Krispy Kreme donuts, but I digress. So basically in the span of 30 days he gained 26 pounds, more than doubled his cholesterol and other dietary levels, and began the process of pickling his liver as if he were an alcoholic. Upon seeing the movie I learned many facts a select few of which I will share with you now:   *You would have to walk for seven hours straight to burn off a Super Sized Coke, fry and Big Mac   *In the U.S., we eat more than 1,000,000 animals an hour (and may I say "God bless America")   *Willard Scott was the first Ronald McDonald - he was fired for being too fat   *Only seven items on McDonald's entire menu contain no sugar   *McDonald's states: "Any processing our foods undergo make them more dangerous than unprocessed foods"   *McDonald's calls people who eat a lot of their food "Heavy Users"   I'll let you ponder those and let the message boards flow with all the glory you possess. I'm off to solidify my status as "heavy user", which consequently I had the tremendous urge to go to McDonald's immediately after seeing the movie, so I guess my brain is made of hot apple pies, and McDonaldland Cookies. Robble robble!

      ...take me to another land, make me forget all the hurt and let me understand your plan. That's right boys and girls today's post is sponsored by Tennessee (my apologies to Arrested Development and especially "Mr. Wendell" for butchering those lines). Ah Tennessee, the land of loud orange-ness, Christian Music SuperStardom ;-), and some of the finest sour mash whiskey a person could find (i mean, err...umm...so I've heard...yeah that's it...so I've heard). I'm off for a few days in the Volunteer State with Jessie and her family, so I won't have much to post over the next few days (whatever will you do?).  Perhaps when I return I will have the solution to something really perplexing like, how did Paris Hilton get famous (internet issues aside), I mean when you think about it she doesn't do anything but be rich and stick her arm up cows butts.  I can see I'm well on my way to getting off topic here very early on, so it's best to leave while the leaving is still leavable. Be back in a few days...
