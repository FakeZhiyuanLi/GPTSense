      Hey Everyone, Just wanted to update you on some stuff! Well for one thing I AM SO OVER MANUEL(about time)! GO ME! Then last night at the skating rink Nichole and this gurl that goes out with her ex got into and Nichole called me cryin and it sounded alot like I did when me and Manuel broke up....but I could really say anything to  her cause when I was goin through those times no one was there for me so I dont think I should be there for them                         But I guess the only reason that Im over Manuel is that he has been givin my phone number out to all these ppl at summer school...and tellin them stupid stuff about me....but looks whos stupid hes the one sittin in summer school!!!LOL! Not me! And he can go with that fat a** gurl that smokes and dates other race ppl...and see if i want to touch him again...for all i know she prolly has deceases!!LOL! But I look at it like this....Im pretty and Im not hurtin to get a boyfriend by no means..and Im not goin to sit here and cry over some stick boy that dont even care about me! LOL!  SO LIKE MY MOM SAID F U(manuel) AND THE HORSE U RODE IN ON!!!LOL!!!i love it!  Ok......NOW HERES SOME CUTE QUOTES..... *How is it that you\'re a s|ut if you\'ve slept with lots of guys, but you\'re a  b!tch if you\'ve slept with no one? *MaRrAgE: GuyS GaIN 20 POUnDs AND GeT HoOkeD to WaTchIn tV in THeIr BOxErS: WOmEn ReAlIze WhAt A bIg MisTakE it waS. *WaItiNg For BoYs To GrOw Up..
