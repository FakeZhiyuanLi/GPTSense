      As reported last month of the cruising vessel holding worlds largest wad of gum suddenly vanishing in the night.  Its fate was deemed discovered yesterday when biologists out on a whale watch saw what appeared to be a killer whale protecting what they then believed the elusive gum.    When they pulled in for closer inspection, the whale quickly made what looked like an offering to finally relieve itself of it's newly acquired burden to which the scientists all too happily obliged.  It wasn't until head scientist, Larry McPeterson, stretched out their new discovery for the crew to discover they had been  urlLink terribly mistaken .

       As much as I'd like to just post them on the main page, I can't.  The picture sizes mess everything up, so click away!   I stumbled across this a few months ago and it still makes me laugh.

      (Wow, wrote this last week and forgot to post it.  Surely old news by now, but oh well.) That's right, the summer concert festival of the year is cancelled!   Lollapalooza Cancelled! Interest spikes in next year's festival as Farrell announces addition of his own crying stage Chris Rediske reports: In what can only be considered one of the most depressing comments so far on the state of independent music, all dates on this year's massive (and massively reported on) Lollapalooza tour have been cancelled due to poor ticket sales. In a statement on the Lollapalooza website this morning, tour organizer and all-around freak Perry Farrell made the following statement: "My heart aches along with the bands, and all of our employees, whose hard work developed one of the most exciting and important tours that this nation was to see. My heart is broken."  In a slightly more informational statement, co-founder Marc Geiger stated, "I am in utter disbelief that a concert of this stature, with the most exciting line-up I've seen in years did not galvanize ticket sales. I'm surprised that given the great bands and the reduced ticket prices that we didn't have enough sales to sustain the tour. Concert promoters across the country are facing similar problems. Many summer tours are experiencing weak ticket sales." The tour was scheduled to launch July 14th in Auburn, Washington.  What exactly this means to the 30 or so acts-- among them Modest Mouse, Morrissey, Sonic Youth, and The Flaming Lips-- that will now have no summer tour schedule is unclear, although several of the bands in question had already scheduled dates in between their Lollapalooza appearances. What it means to those of you who had already bought tickets to Lollpalooza is somewhat more clear-- you're getting your money back. But not your trusting good nature.  .: Lollapalooza: http://www. lollapalooza.com     In other news: I'll be missing the Summer Sonic Festival again this year seeing as I'll be going home to visit people and things.  This year's line-up highlights are as follows:   DAY 1  Green Day              Avril Lavigne The Darkness           Sum 41  Pennywise              MC5 Peaches   DAY 2  Beastie Boys           Mad Capsule Markets NAS                    N.E.R.D. Lost Prophets          Jurassic 5 The Music              The Hives  Day 1 looks pretty standard, although seeing Peaches would be pretty cool.  Then again, day 2 looks like a once in a lifetime chance.  I'll have to get one of Yumiko's friends to tape it for me or listen to all the great stories my friends will have of going.

      I figured I will write a bit of a blub on here about the way I've been feeling lately, instead of typing it over and over on msn.  Now I can just send a link, weeee.    So I started to feel like junk again starting a couple of weeks ago. Old buddy chrones said, "you know I just haven't been acting up enough lately".  And then BAM it kicked it up a notch. For the most part I just left it be, figuring it will pass, it usually does.  But its been a while and doesn't look like its going to pass for a while.  It actually got to the point I figured I would quit drinking, at least for awhile, after burstall grad.  Anyhoo grad rolls around weird I'm 14lbs. lighter.  Thats fruity.  Also later at the bar I barely finished a beer, then I almost puked outside. Thats spiffy.  So looks like I quit drinking right then not later that night.  So I was out at the grad party as a sober sister.  It actually wasn't that bad, but I'm sure I probably could have had more fun if I was as loaded as everyone else.  Also its shitty because the next day while everyone was hungover I probably felt just as bad if not worse, which led to me not going out anymore that weekend.  Sounds like I missed a good time in richmound. booo.  So now I am taking more pills, I was down to 2, but now I'm back up to 6.  I also get to take Iron and B12 now hopefully to fix the tiredness due to not have enough iron and b12. And hopefully after the next time I get into the doctor I will be able to get on prednisone again.  This is a joyfull little steroid that worked wonders before.  The only trouble is you can't stay on it forever even though it works like a dream, because it eventually will cause more problems.  I don't know the exact problems but I think it prevents absorbtion of certain nutrients and things. I have enough trouble with that as it is without pills causing the same problem.  Down to the real problem:  I get constant stomach aches, or intestinal cramps, what ever you want to call them.  The link shows some pics that I found. Your intestines are supposed to me smooth and I think pink in color, not all gangly and sore looking like the ones in the pics. After my next scope, which I imagine will happen within the next month maybe I'll get pics of my own not somebody else. I know everyone looks forward to that.  I also get wicked fevers throughout the day. Most of them are 39degrees C or about 102 degrees F, not pleasant. I also get really tired and burn out quickly, not because I'm out of shape, but due to that fact that chrones has made me anemic, thats what the iron and b12 are supposed to be fix.  Anemic means I lack red blood cells, which leads to not getting much oxygen in the blood, which leads to me being a tired sack of garbage.  Right now I also can't eat much, it just feels like I am rediculously full even though I have barely eaten anything.  It also feels like I'm am going to throw up while eating and after eating. Depending on the food, I do puke after eating(not very often), the only real gaurantee of a yammy is chilli, chilli is off the menu.  Anyways thats the bulk of it, I'll add more if I feel like it, or think of anything interesting. Just figured I would let people know what was going on, so when they ask me "hey I heard you weren't feeling well and quit drinking because you are a pussy", well now I can point everyone here and they can read all about it.  Its also not all rainy days, some of the weight has come back, I don't really feel any better but the weight is coming back which is always a good thing.  So hopefully after I see the doctor in about a week, I get everything taken care off.  that is all  later

        Seeing as I just bought my wife's engagement ring and our wedding bands in Shinjuku (Tokyo) a little while ago, this is not good news...     Tokyo world's most expensive city; Osaka No. 4 in survey   Monday, June 14, 2004 at 10:14 JST LONDON â€” Tokyo remains the world's most expensive city, according to the latest cost of living survey by Mercer Human Resource Consulting released Monday.  London was ranked 2nd, Moscow 3rd, with Osaka and Hong Kong rounding out the top five most expensive cities, while Asuncion in Paraguay is the least expensive city in the survey of 144 urban areas.   American cities were absent from the top 10 due to the weak U.S. dollar, with the most expensive U.S. city, New York, dropping two spots from last year to 12.  The survey, drawn up twice a year, ranks cost of living for foreign workers, not local residents, and is used primarily by multinational companies to determine pay for expatriate employees.  "The euro appreciated more than 11 percent in the last six months," said Marie-Laurence Sepede, senior researcher at Mercer. "So that made European cities go up and U.S. cities drop."  Sepede noted that while U.S. cities got cheaper in relation to those in Europe and Asia, the rankings among American cities remained similar to previous years, with Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco all placing high on the list.  Also notable was the climb of Australian and New Zealand cities up the list, a shift caused by those nations' strong currencies. Sydney moved from 67 last year to 20 this year, and Auckland, New Zealand climbed 35 places to 80.  The rest of the top 20 remained fairly constant, although Paris, Vienna and Istanbul made their first appearances so high in the rankings.  The survey took into consideration 250 criteria, including the cost of utilities, food and entertainment.  While the survey looked at a range of living standards, Sepede said the study was most representative of the expenses of people working for big international corporations and maintaining fairly high standards of living.  Mercer said the continued appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could eventually force companies to move employees and reorganize.  "Mainly, the depreciation of the dollar makes it cheaper to send employees to American cities," said Jackie Barber, a spokeswoman for the survey. (Wire reports)

      Over the past few months I've been playing a lot of games and figure I'd share my thoughts on a few.   Zelda: 4 Swords Adventure     Pretty much the only reason I bought this was because in Japan, if you bought this game, you'd recieve lots and lots of "bonus" credits at the  urlLink Club Nintendo  website towards the "Zelda Collection Disc which contains 4 previous titles and is pretty badass. Since I missed out on the north american promotion I figured I should jump on the gravey train now.  Turns out the game was really fun, but I was playing with an 8 year old japanese boy who just wanted to throw and hit things.  Trying to carry on in the game became too much of a headache with him and I've decided to put it away until I can play with someone with a little more intrest invested into it.  My Japanese version also includes a game omitted in the NA release because of translation issues and a pack of cry babies.  It's cool for a bit, but then you forget about it soon enough.  After shelving this game for the time being I found a copy of Jet Set Radio: Future for the xbox on the cheap.      Great looking and fun to play.  I don't think I've logged some many hours in such a little time on any game in the past year or so.  Once I hit 30 hours and couldn't figure out where to go next (which is a pretty big flaw in the game, not being clear on what to do next)it was already time to celebrate the release of Pikmin 2!     I've been playing Pikmin 2 now for about a month.  Out of 201 collectables in the game, I've gotten 194 and the last few are connected to the final game bosses which wipe out so many of my little fellows at once it makes me pretty uneasy trying to repeatedly attempt them.  If you loose too many, then you have to take the time again to reharvest a new army which is fun but quite a deturrent.  While I've experienced about 98% of the game and have hit 55 hours, I can reccommend this game unconditionally.  Once I've gotten over the final few hurdles of Pikmin 2, I've got a fresh copy of the Chronicles of Riddick waiting for me.      I found out that the US version is playable on the Japanese xbox just the other day, so I'm happy about that.  Another strange thing is, is that this has to be the first movie licensed game that has scored a consiterable amount of high scores from almost every gaming publication.  And once that's finished up with, I have to get back to my neglected copy of SSX:3 and Project Gotham racing: 2.  Curt:  Not sure if you read any of this, but I'm thinking about bringing my xbox back to canada this summer.  Do you think James can take a look at it for me.  It seems to only want to preform the things it's intended to do.  Weird.  Get back to me sometime in the next few weeks if he can "repair" something for me.

      While I've always been happy with my first purchase, this new pinstripped mamma-jamma was at an incredible steal and too good to pass up.  Now I'm left with a decision, which to keep and which to try to hawk on an auction site.  The Hanshin Tigers Gamecube/gameboyplayer is an incredible collectible which resulted from an odd season of baseball last year.  Plus I should note that it is very easy to modify should I want to play games from around the world on it.  The gameboy player is something I've always wanted too.  The "Q" looks rad, plus with it's recent stop in production, it makes this a collectible too.  Gameboy players are no longer made for it but can be found on Ebay for $300 instead of the usual $50.  Region 2 dvd playback is also a bonus for me.  I have no need for two of them, but parting with one will be mighty tough considering their uniqueness.  What to do, what to do?

        I think this album has been out for a few days now and I'm sure all you people with normal television have seen their single, but I haven't done any of that so this serves me more than it may you.  Although, I have heard the single on the American Army base's AM station but it was sorta fuzzy at the time.  From what I heard, it sounds pretty much how I expected it to sound, which is good and bad, I guess.  Curious about the rest of the album.  Maybe I'll get WinMX fired up tonight to see what all the fuss is about.  Review:  This is just one man's (apparently biased views) on the new Beastie Boys album.

If anybody doesn't get a heavy feeling in their stomach after watching this, then you just might be a toaster.  Click the title and sit back.

       urlLink    So since I hear that Japan is such a supporter of a wide variety of soft drinks, Coca-cola decided it would be spiffy to introduce the "new(est)" coke here first.   If that's the case, then I'm the first of you do get my mits on it.  Seeing as I can't even remember the last time I actually bought a coke (or pepsi) this one tasted pretty much the same.  Maybe not as snip-snappity fizzy though.   And since all products can't be sold until it reaches a certain garbage making requirement, this one comes with a special offer for a special "C2" cell phone strap!  Lucky day!  I say stick with the juice and water, kids.  This'll rought your teeth out.  &nbsp; urlLink

This clip is one of about 6 that  urlLink IGN DVD  has up.

      ....is what we all wanted to hear, but alas their true self shines through and the fluke season finally catches up.  Had a lot of fun this year going out "on school nights" to watch the games with friends who don't know how to make their VHS tape from 3 hours to 6 and missing out on the last few minutes on two consecutive games.  Actually I just came home from game 7 and am still a little buzzed so you'll have to excuse the sloppiness.  Out of all the game I watched, Calgary lost.  Bunch of losers.  I admit that I was a really good series and the only one I can remember that has kept my interest in about sayyyyyyy 10 years.  You'll notice that Canada hasn't been in the finals for the past 9 or 10 years which leads to why my interest has been out to lunch during that time.  Don't have too much more to say than that.  The rainy season started up early this year.  That means the clouds are crying for Canada, so I'm told.  Yep, one month of rain.  One month of moldy shirts and spiders who take refuge in your home only to build webs in the night for you to walk through in your morning stupor.  Well, here's hoping a decent Canadian team makes it to the finals next year.  My cheering for Calary was kind of forced considering the USA, Canada match up.  Glad to finally see it though.  later,

      Well, I've never tried anything like this before but I remember Caleb saying someday he'd like to create a webpage where a group of friends can just write down whatever they want, whenever.  That had to have been a good 3/4 years ago, but me being an elephant, remembered it and still think it's a good idea.  I figure blogging is easy enough for all participants to use so let's get at it.  Anybody who wants to join in, has suggestions of layout, needs a quick link to something dirty, let me know and I'll see what I can do.  This is my first time using one of these and I have the idea that the creater is the controller as well, so I'm not just trying to be a dick by asking for all things to be run past me.  Do whatever you want.  I'm not easly offended.  For an idea of what I plan on posting, I think I'll keep it do mostly games, music, art, impressions of things, personal diary, confessions and generally things I think are of interest.  Note: I played around with it for a few minutes and what I think I'll do is email some people who I think would be intrested and contribute and then sign them up to the page to allow them posting privilages.  That's all I've thought of for now.  Look's like fun though.  later,

      Here's a keen video of some guy playing Mario tunes on the piano.  Grab a cup of Joe before you click though cause it's 10 minutes long.  The highlight, I'd guess, is at the beginning of his composition where he plays blindfolded.  Cool, but not the main reason to watch.  The main reason to click is to watch this guy goes nuts on the piano for 10 minutes with mario tunes and to reminisce of simpler times.  Oh ya, the title was ment because this guy plays blind for a while and his head isn't bobbing and weaving all over.  So that means the head dance is probably a black thing, or that Stevey had water in his ear....crazy water!   urlLink I think someone should be hired to play my wedding...

      hmm my last post about serious sam didn't seem to appear on the "pretty page" or maybe it just doesn't show up on my computer. Weird.  Anyways went to the doctor yesterday to try and get some stuff figured out.  So now I get to take more pills, I'm up to 15 a day.  6pentasa, 4 prednisone, 2 (some kind of antibiotic, 2 iron, 1 b12.  All prescription.  The good news, no colonoscopy, or ass cam on a long colon reaching tube. Weeeeeeeeee.  The prednisone and antibiotic are the new ones.  I've never used this antibiotic before, I'm not even real sure why I'm taking it.  All I do know about it is that I really can't drink now or I'll toss my biscuits, says so on the label. Prednisone on the other hand is the steroid that got everything under control the first time, so hopefully it has the same magical effects this time around.  So I'm hoping by the end of this week I start to see some turn around.  Its only been one day so far and nothing has happend.  Thats about it, more as it unfolds.

      So a little while back there was a news paper article stating that once again Tokyo is the most expensive city you can ever find.  Oh, and Osaka came in at #4, not that that's anything to scoff at but it just goes to prove that Japan is an incredibly expensive country to do anything in.  And when you do get to do that something, it's usually of the smallest degree because there are a million other people trying to do the same thing.    I've asked Japanese friends about why certain things are so expensive and they normally just give me the, "I dunno, it just is." line and it's left at that.  Why is a movie theater ticket $20?  I dunno.  Why are all hotels on a per person basis when your only using the one room?  I dunno.  Why is Japan's staple food so expensive? Dunno. (Hint: They abuse tariffs to protect their over priced shenanigans.)  Why is this melon $100?  That's a special melon.  I don't even want to get started on the obligatory "Thank you" money you have to pay when you move to a new apartment and the other things you are expected of at that time.  So if any of these types of questions baffle you like they do me, then this might be something you'd like to read.  It answers why prices with most everything here is so inflated and why you don't see too much foreign influence in Japan.  The mindset of ignorant Japanese consumers and the blatantly rigged distribution system.  The more I read about Japan, the less gung-hoe I am about investing in it's future.  This isn't to totally rip on the country because there are a lot of good things going for it.  I just want to raise some issues that always seem to be skirted around.   urlLink  Why are Prices in Japan so darn Expensive?   It's a pretty long read but I found a lot of it to be really interesting even if the tone is a little whinny at times.

      So I used to think that I was good at shooting games.  Either I never was or I lost all my skills.  I bought Serious Sam: The Next Encounter today.  It was only $30, so what the hell, I liked it on computer.  I don't even think I could play doom anymore looking at the way this is going. I've already demoted myself to easy from normal. Stella has to get his groove back.  So far its not bad, I mean sure its bad but serious sam isn't really supposed to be good. Its just non stop shooting which I miss a little. No stealth or any real sneaky skills involved, just keep killing until the door opens.  Indeed it gets repetitive but whatever sometimes just running around senselessly is good times.  Thats about it I haven't played much, too tired, maybe thats why I'm shitty, but I doubt it. And I'm not looking forward to the monkies in the linked pic.
