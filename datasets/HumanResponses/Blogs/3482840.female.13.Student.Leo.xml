         This  is my new blog all about my school and social related life. C.Love Diaries is my AWAY from school life blog. If it happened at school, it's here. If it happened over the weekend, it's THERE. Get the picture?     NEway,  the title of this blog is "Let the Gossip and Backstabbing Continue." This is so because, HELLO this is High School. I do NOT plan on living it like my mom did. Only one or two friends, who were constantly being threatened if they didn't make fun of my mom. Once my mom's BF Melda ((i know... weird)) was being threatened that if she didn't call my mom a warthog ((since that's the worst there was back then)) these other girls would basically kick her @$$. So she says, "Rosie, I hate to do this to you but you know I love you. WARTHOG!" And my mom threw her across the floor and into the wall in the cafeteria, which I'm assuming really hurts when smacked against your skull. OUCH.       Yeah  well, since school hasn't started, I'll leave you now. Later daze!

      Mrs. Miller is our new Junior/Senior High Principal. Weird since she WAS the special ed. teacher a while back. NEway, now the Wagner formerly known as "Principal" is Superintendant.  I wrote Principal Miller a letter to get her to bring the dance team back. I think it's pretty convincing, and we put on there that she should scheduale a meeting for us to discuss it. It would be SO cool if she brought it back finally!  In 2 weeks I have 2 pick up my scheduale at the school. We have a new French teacher too! Her name is Mrs. Melha Woods... her hubby Mr. James Woods, is teaching Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. Mrs. Hart is teaching Physical Science, General Biology, AND Health now. Talk about multi-tasking...

      I'm at Carolann's right now. I met her Grandma! She's a little scary... she was playing with my hair... IDK why but... I met a whole buncha ppl over there @ Carolann's party, but I don't care to remember all their names. Her uncle's cool though.  NEway,  I actually watched an R rated movie, and it wasn't as scary as Carolann tried to make me think... It was THIR13EN GHOSTS in case you care at all... And we watched Galerians:Rion 2. It wasn't actually all that bad... but the makers of that movie are severely twisted. Either that or they have a LOT of time on their hands. But I DO like the soundtrack... which we r listening 2 right now b/c Carolann has it.  Yeah well.  Ooh we had cheesecake! That was good... and popcorn and chips  ((mild salsa, not 2 hot! *lol*)) And her mommy bought me  Stewarts root beer... mmmm... that's the best! Well we rented  Along Came Polly  and  The Perfect Score  so it's movie night! Hmmm... that's pretty much all 4 now. Catcha l8tr ppl!!!

      ... to Grandmother's house we go. I had to stay @ Grams' house last night b/c mom had a show @ Hickory ((DJing)) and Kevin's with us b/c his dad was busy and couldn't take him. You can pretty much guess they're divorced. NEway, I spent yesterday watching TV ((Fairly Oddparents Channel Chasers!)) and playing with my Grandma's new kitten. She's all black so I wanted to name her Mystery, but Grams can't say that right so we named her Misty. She's so cute! =^_^=  We're skipping bible study @ church this morning b/c mommy has a bad headache. NOT my fault she's not used to the bar NEmore... loud, drunk ppl singing... Youch! But I hope we're going to service. Church is a lot more fun now. ^_^ But u know y! Well that's all 4 now! L8TR!!!

      1) I got the JoJo CD! And I got the Cheetah Girls Soundtrack w/ karaoke tracks 2. &nbsp; 2) I met Andrew ((the guy from church)). He's pretty cute, but he's SOOO shy he barely said hi to me. All I know is he's 14, going into 8th grade, and he goes 2 West G. &nbsp; 3) My mom got a new cell, and the guy asked if she wanted 2 put a celly 4 me on the account. Unfort, mom said "That's not happening until she's allowed to date and that will be a while!" O_O HELLO! I'm almost 14, I'm going into high school, and I always get good grades so it's not like I'm irresponsible... -_- She's impossible. She'll let me go out w/ KK ((eeeeww...)) but she won't let me even SPEAK to Andrew.  &nbsp; So so so SOOOO not fair! It wouldn't be a NEW kind of phone, just 1 like her old one. Just simple and CHEAP. But nooooooo... screw it.

      IDK y but my house is freezing! Mrs. Hasman woke me up b/c she called and I'm the only 1 home. She wanted 2 ask my mom what is was like getting her belly botton pierced... apparently Mr. H is talking her into it... weird. So yeah. Yesterday I read  Midnight Magic  by Avi. It's reallly good. U know the whole, ghostly conspiracies, old world castle w/ hidden passages, secret identities, fate told by tarot cards, a thrill-seeking princess, and a new twist every other paragraph. That's my kind of story!   My mom has bible study ppls over here 2night so I have 2 clean the house while mom's @ work... *sigh* If only I had a life during the summer. Uggh...  This weekend I'm going 2 get my JoJo CD, and mayB another 1 but idk what yet. And then the 23rd I have a dentist appt. and an eye-doctor appt. the 26th. Oh how I love the optomotrist... NOT. I hate getting my i's dialated!!! It's gross...  Well that's all 4 now I guess. TTYL!

And my uncle is getting me the Cheetah Girls DVD 4 my birthday! Which is in, 33 days but still. It's all good in the hood. Not that I LIVE in the hood but hey! *lol* Y'all gotta know I know what I mean.   There's not very much going on though. I'm SOOO bored ALL the time. My mom might be getting a job at Holly Hill though so that's cool. I found a stuffed hampster that looks just like Smurf! That's all 4 now so, L8TR DAZE!!!

      Mom and I spent ALL of last night splicing every taped spot in our phone lines, b/c the phone wasn't working. So we FINALLY got it 2 work and I can go online again! WooHoo! I would seriously DIE w/o the internet... Just WAY too dependant on it I guess. Well like if I had stuff to DO I wouldn't miss it. Like if I was at camp or something. But I'm not and this is all there is to do.   Well idk if Rachel's spoken 2 luverboi at all... *cough*Jared*cough* but my mom still doesn't want me 2 be friends with Rachel. OR Carolann OR Heather. Basically she wants me to have NO friends in High School, just like SHE went through it with 1 friend... She LOVES my friends, "just doesn't love their behavior." OK as if APOLOGY ACCEPTED means nothing? That's what friends do. Forgive. But not neccessarily 4get.

      Ok so this guy I was supposed 2 go out w/... never met, liked him a little but not boyfriend material. He used to call every week, but he hasn't called in the past 3 weeks. I then found out that my best friend was gonna go out w/ him. So naturally, I got mad @ her. BIG mistake. I found out from another girl online who lives by this guy, that she has been w/ this guy for 6 months, which is longer than he had even been talking 2 me, let alone my bff. So I tell her, even though I'm mad at her 4 another reason. So now we're both mad as heck at this guy, b/c:   1) He ditched me for my best friend. 2) He cheated on us BOTH w/ the same chick who he's been w/ half a year.  Even though I don't like him, I never TOLD him that. So as far as he knows, I'm still at home absolutely "smitten" and waiting for his call. Oh I'm looking forward to his call alright, but I guarantee you, he won't find it pleasant AT ALL.  ~ME~

      Yesterday I cleaned off all my shelves in my room and got rid of all the junk. Now, 6 shelves across my whole wall full of junk, has become 2 shelves only half-full. Pretty good if I do say so myself. Next I have 2 clean out my cabinet... here we go again. But while cleaning, I found an old radio/tape player that records w/ a buit in microphone. :) That's perfect 4 me! Well I have work to do.  ~*+*~BYENESS!~*+*~

What are ppl gonna think when they find out I'm living w/ grams again? I don't even wanna think about it.   There's not much else going on. I was just @ Heather's. We made reallly cute earrings! Not that either of us can wear them but still! Yeah well, I'm gonna make grilled cheese. Or as the rainbow-folk would say, 'toasted cheese sandwiches'. *lol* Only kidding! L8tr peeps!

       Happy 4th of July to all of you in the USA!!!    Since mom's cash is running low and the job aps. aren't workin out, she's actually considering us renting out the house and moving to KIWANIS! Thanx, but slumming is not included in my interest category... NEway, we were just @ my cousin Danny's in KL and I saw Jason. He finally cut his hair! That was a shocker.  Mom invited Mimi & Lydia over 4 a cookout 2morrow. Great isn't it? Yeah right. Just how I wanted to spend 2morrow after being w/ Lyd ALL weekend. Ah well, nothin I can do about it. So, I g2g.

      All I did like all weekend was play with Carolann and Lydia w/ hula hoops. And I got a dragon statue from mom's friend James 4 working hard. More like hardly working! Yeah well it was fun. We got to ride around in the Jeep w/ the top off. That's rare actually! It hasn't been warm enough yet. Ahhh... well. N2M 2 say... God my life is boring these days. Wait! I DO have something funny. Riding around all weekend w/ the top off the jeep, things kept flying out the windows. U can guess what they were from some clues.  1) It's hand-held, can be used with a TV or  radio , and is an aid to laziness. 2) It's round, smells good, and can be used in a  car  or in the house.  So can u guess what flew out the windows? I'll give you the answers when I have a few guesses. OK, talk 2 u all l8tr then. Byeness!

       I went with Grams and saw the Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement today. It was a great sequel! It had a really cool ending too. Word is they're thinking of a third movie!!! YAY!!!       Then we went to KMart so I could get Rachel's b-day gifts. Of course I got some of my OWN as well. This IS me we're talking about! Grams bought me 2 new pair of shoes. One are white SOHO courts w/ blue stripes on the sides, and the other are navy and pink leather tennies for gym. But when I don't HAVE gym they're for all the time. FINALLY new shoes!!! I miss shopping SO much.      And then we went 2 eat at Mangia's and I saw Eileen. DUH b/c she works there! But w/e. Then I came home and got online. GAH! I almost 4got! KEVIN'S BACK FROM HIS DAD'S!!! NOOOO!!!! Friday can't come soon enough so I can go to Rachel's and get away from him!

       Ok so we actually went to see A Cinderella Story w/ Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray ((who, btw, is SOOO hott!)). But we're going 2maro 2 see the Princess Diaries. Julia still doesn't think we can do it. And Rachel spent the night Sunday night. She decided to quit volleyball but every1 yelled at her so she's gonna break down and join back up. I knew it. She should just tell them it's her decision and stand by that.

      I'm going with Grams and Rose O. to see the Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. It should be an awesome movie! I've already seen the first 5 minutes of the movie on a Disney 411 Exclusive.  Andrew was at church again. He still ignores me completely and runs out of the building as soon as it's over. So I NEVER get a chance to say hi... :( It's not cool...  Julia also said that we can't bring back Knightettes unless we have a band, and she said we have to raise $1,500 before school starts. No offense, but she's crazy! At clinic we used CD's and tapes and played them over the PA. O_o? Oh well. If she doesn't even wanna TRY, more power to ya Jules. Still luv ya.  Well I'm chatting w/ some ppl so, I g2g! L8tr!

       My mom has a karaoke show in Geneva that goes till 11pm tonight, and starts in an hour. I haven't seen mom since 10 this morning and I'm already bored out of my small, fragile mind. So I'm gonna call Grams and see if she'll take me somewhere. I dunno where but, we'll see. If Grams was like Carolann's nana ((scary...)), I wouldn't love her so much.    And Mr. Kuchta's family history project was so cool, since I interviewed Grams. I had no idea that she married my Grandpa TWICE, once in Italy and once in the US, or that she was a lunch lady at OUR SCHOOL years and years before her oldest son was a twinkle in Grandpa's eye. It was so awesome that she even remembered! After her 3 strokes and loss of memories, we had to teach her how to tie her shoes again! But she could remember stuff from farther back than I ever cared to think about.    She even told me about how my Grandpa worked at Carling's Black Label Brewery, but he never drank alcochol at all. And she told me how they got arrested on thier honeymoon because they weren't sure if Grams was really a US citizen. Grams is SO cool. Oh, and she's an AWESOME cook!

       Rachel's asking ppl if they wanna be on the team, Heather's in, and I'm gonna call Carolann and try to GUILT her into it. *lol* "All the things we do for you!" That should work. Now I was thinking for one of the songs, we could use "One-Girl Revolution" from the Cadet Kelly Soundtrack. I'll see if I can get it. Meanwhile, here's the lyrics:                  I wear a disguise

       OK guys here's the deal. You know Mrs. Miller is our new principal right? Well, I wrote her a letter to see if she'd bring Knightettes back since the second levy passed and it's not back. I think it's really convincing, especially since my mom's friend Nicole wants to coach us! I know Heather's interested, I doubt Carolann would be but you could do it with us ((!)), and Ray you probably are but I need to know.    When I have the meeting w/ Principal Miller before the new year I want to be able to tell her how many girls would do it. Rach, if you would could you ask Vicky, KC, Julia, Hali, and whoever else if they'd want to do it? Thanx in advance. I REALLY wanna do this and she won't unless she really thinks enough girls would want to. Trust me, Nicole's been in dance since before high school and she still dances in competitions. She can do this if we want her to. Everyone loves our moves Ray, let's get serious about it! Heather's in already, yay Heather!!! I'll CALL and ask Carolann.

      We went to the Medieval Faire yesterday and we brought Carolann. It was a LOT of fun. I saw one of their Jousting Tournaments for the first time, and our champion won. Of course! We got lost in the Labyrinth trying to find the bell, but Carolann & I still beat Kevin at finding everything. Mom bought me an Elven crown, that's a single strand w/ a hanging crystal. Mom's is the same only hers is two strands woven together w/ a crystal. There was this one guy there at a stand, who dressed his little poodle up as a dragon. He was sooo cute! The dog, not the guy.  Aside from all that, we saw pasrt of the Tortuga Twins' show (("We've upped OUR standards, now UP YOURS!!!")), some dagger-juggling, a comedy show by Issac Faulkes - Magician and his assistant, and bagpipe players. It was really cool.  Well that's all for now. G2G!
