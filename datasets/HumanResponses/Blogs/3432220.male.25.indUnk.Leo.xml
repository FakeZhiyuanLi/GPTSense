       urlLink MadBlast - Can You Pass The Third Grade?   As pathetic as it sounds, I could only name the location of about 25 or so States before the time limit was up. After realizing just how sad it is that a 24 year old college graudate thinks New Hampshire is in the Mid-West, I decided to practice and memorize the map. I can now solve this puzzle mistake free before the timer reaches half-way.  Thanks to Flex for sending this to me.

      After I left work yesterday, as I was heading on over to Port Authority, I heard some loud music coming from Bryant Park. I went in to investigate and discovered that HBO and Sony were filming a free Dido concert. I've never seen Dido live before, but have always been a fan of her CDs. The show was great; she is absolutely amazing live. I only stayed for about 5 songs. It started raining pretty hard so I headed home.  Later that night, I met up with Marie, Dan, and a few other people from Susan Blond and RoadRunner Records to see  urlLink The Dresden Dolls  play at Maxwell's. It was really good for the first 45 minutes, but the set went on for about another hour afterwards and I was getting very antsy to get home. It was a fun time though and hung out with some cool people. Unfortunately, I came home to see a Yankee loss and Red Sox victory. Hopefully the Yanks will put a hurtin' on the Dodgers and Mets in the upcoming series' before sweeping the Sox in a bout of sweet revenge.  Also, I came across this story today:  urlLink "80 Days" a Flop  and can't help but share these two comments:  1. Who the fuck thinks Jackie Chan is a good actor? Not only is his "Engrish" TERRIBLE, but he lacks any sort of acting skills whatsoever. When are movie executives going to realize that the only thing this guy does well is Kung-Fu. Here's a simple formula for the movie studios...  Jackie Chan + Leading Roll  ยน  $$$   2. Fuck Disney. The only good Disney movie in recent years that I can think of is "Finding Nemo" and they pretty much shot themselves in the foot with Pixar by screwing them in an unfavorable distribution deal. They are the parent company of Miramax and are constantly giving them a hard time because of their "violent movies." They put the pressure on Quentin Tarantino to tone-down the promotions of the "Kill Bill" movies, and now refuse to distribute Fahrenheitt 9/11" by Michael Moore. I think Michael Moore is a fat,whiney prick, but "Bowling For Columbine" was a great movie, and while I don't agree with a lot of his anti-Bush rhetoric, it's still a movie I am anxious to see, and many others will see as well. For a publicly trade company, they sure do make some crappy decisions to help increase their stock value. Disney has to realize that nobody in our generation gives a fuck about Mickey Mouse and their Baby-Boomer history. More kids around the world can probably identify Mario (Super Mario Bros.) than Mickey Mouse anyway. To Disney I say: Get off your high fucking horse and realize you're not the company you were when my parents were kids. You keep putting out shit movies like "The Emperor's New Groove" and think you're this prestigious powerhouse that is better than everyone else. I can't wait until the day comes when Disney gets bought out and is re-structured into a company that doesn't think they hold the torch for morality and decency in this country. Fuck You Michael Eisner.

       urlLink      The Killers   Hot Fuss   I've been listening to this album for a few weeks now, and I need to share just how great it is...   Not long ago, I was in a long car trip and listening to a mix CD I made for the ride when Alphaville's "Forever Young" came on, followed by When In Rome's "The Promise." I then made a comment that there needs to be a New-Wave resurrection in music today, but not done in a cheesy way. The closest band I've found that's somewhat been able to do this is Stellastarr*, but it's still not to the point of being as good as I'd like. Then I stumbled upon an advance of The killers  Hot Fuss  record and have been blown away by it's greatness.  Entertainment Weekly didn't give it justice in its review of the album by calling it a Stroke's rip-off band; the Killers sound NOTHING like the Strokes. First off, you can understand what the lead singer says in every song. Secondly, unlike the Strokes, none of these songs sound the same. If anything, this band sounds like a unique blend of Interpol, Echo and the Bunnymen and Blur, with their own flavor mixed in. If you want to hear a kick-ass record from start to finish, definitely listen to  Hot Fuss .

        The season premier of "Six Feet Under" aired tonight and it continues to be the best show in the history of TV. I conveyed this thought to Erik a couple of weeks ago and he asked if I thought it was better than "The X-Files" in its prime, and I still have to say, hands down...that it's not even a contest; "Six Feet Under" is that fucking amazing.  The character development on this show is so good for everyone in the cast that you almost feel like the entire hour was just devoted just to them. Each episode leaves you with a unique feeling of sadness and excitement that, as I've told other people, should have its own unique name.  If you have not seen this show, and have HBO...do yourself a favor and buy or rent the Season One box set. It's way too late for you to just jump in, and you'll have to watch the first two episodes before your hooked. After watching the first episode, I said to myself: "this show is okay, but it's nothing great," and simply watched the second one just because it was there. After that though, I was hooked. It's the equivalent of televised crack. Season Two is being released in a month or so, and God only knows when Season Three will be released. (Season Four just started.) Point is...it's never too late to start...and you will thank me in the end.

      I think this is a new record. I've had "Maps" by the  Yeah Yeah Yeah's  stuck in my head for four days straight now. Don't get me wrong...it's a great song to have stuck in my head, even though there are only a few sentences that make up the entire song, but still...four days is a little long to have a song stuck in your head for. It always boggles my mind how a song can get "stuck" in your head anyway. Perhaps the fact that I think I have some sort of functional ADD makes me more susceptible to it.  Tonight I went to Tonic with George, Jay, Beth, Beth's cousin (whose name I forgot), and Laurie. It was packed for a while, but as soon as the hip-hop (shit) stopped playing and the 80's New Wave (awesome) started pumping, the place practically emptied out. At about 1:30, I decided I had enough and headed home. I arrived to find a passed out/drunk person sleeping/passed out in the foyer of my building blocking the entrance, but a quick call to the police put an end to that in about 2 minutes.

      This site is great. Another quality link courtesy of Erica!  Feelin' like crap today. I think I'm on a one-way street to a sinus infection. YESSSSSSSS! LOVE SINUS INFECTIONS!!!!!  Today at work, I traded in $60 worth of crappy free CDs I've acquired over the months to  urlLink Spun  and ordered  urlLink "The Legend of Zelda: The Four Swords."  Yes, I know...I'm a dork. But at least I'll be a dork with a new Zelda game for free!

      Diet Coke with Lime is disgusting. I purchased it along with my lunch today because I've always wondered how it tasted, but I will never make that mistake again.  If you haven't tasted Diet Coke with Lime and wonder what it's like, here are some directions to recreate it.   Diet Coke with  Lime   1. Open up your cupboard and grab a glass; preferably one that will hold more than 12 oz. 2. Slice up a lime and squeeze some of the juice into the glass. 3. Pour a shot of Jack Daniels into that glass. 4. Urinate into the glass. 5. Stir. Serve chilled.  Nothing kills a nice Salad and Hummus lunch than some spiked urine.

       urlLink    I had the day off from work yesterday, so I exchanged my old GameBoy Advance for the new GameBoy Advance SP that looks like the old-school NES controller. I also purchased Excitebike...one of the most classic games ever!  Later that night, Erik and I went to the Yankee game. Interleague games are never as fun since there isn't really a hatred against the other team (unless it's the Mets, Marlins, D-Backs or Braves, for me at least.) Nevertheless, it was still a fun time, and they won 2-1. There was this beastly woman sitting in front of us who just talked all game long to these guys she was with. She was drunk, thought she was sexy, and close to getting a foot to the back of the head by Erik. In retaliation to her loud annoying conversations that to no surprise we NOT about the game she was "watching," Erik and I decided to clap as loud as our hands could take as close to her head as we could get without touching her. When that didn't work, Erik poured water on her seat when she stood up and we had a chuckle when she sat down and had water on her back. Unfortunately, she probably just figured it was sweat from one of the rolls in her back fat.  On the way out of the game, we ran into none other than JOE REDMOND from Oneonta! He was my college roommate my freshman year and always a cool dude. Ends up he's a cop in the ghetto of East Flatbush.  Unfortunately, the Red Sox held on to win 1-0 over the Padres, so the Yanks lead is still 2 and 1/2 games.

      I read an interesting fact today. The average man spends 179 hours a year in the bathroom. For you math whizzes out there, that's nearly seven and a half days a year. Now I have to assume that a big chunk of that time is reserved for showering and shaving, but a sizeable portion is the the act of urinating and bowel movements (pissing and shitting, if you will).  This morning, after my sausage, egg and cheese sandwich I had for breakfast, washed down with a bottle of apple juice, I naturally needed to go to the bathroom. Before doing my business, I needed to place one of those paper seat covers atop the seat, just to be safe. (We've all heard the horror stories from our mothers of catching herpes, crabs or plague from sharing public toilets). After the first two ripped while taking them out of their on-so-inconvenient holder, I finally was able to get the third one on the seat, (although it nearly slid into the bowl before I had a chance to put my ass on top of it and keep it in place.) This is when it dawned on me that I am jaded. I am so used to having two or three seat covers rip before making contact with the bowl that this doesn't annoy me anymore. Then I started thinking about how much extra money must be wasted in this country on crappy toilet seat cover casualties simply because we as a race can't create something better!  Now don't get me wrong...the technology to create sanitary, comfortable toilet seat covers IS OUT THERE. If you want to see for yourself...go into an airport bathroom. I cannot speak for every airport out there, but O'Hare specifically gets an A+ in my book on toilet comfort.  For those of you unaware of the O'Hare toilets, they feature this plastic ring that wraps around the toilet seat...reminiscent of a condom. When you are ready to do your business, you press a button on this unit, and it magically sucks in the used portion of the plastic and replaces it with a new, clean portion. The used plastic then rolls up in a separate section of the toilet for the janitor to easily discard. (For more information on this amazing seat, visit  urlLink Hygo-Tech .)  I am also unnerved by the toilet paper holders in this country found in public bathrooms. Now I understand completely the need to keep them secure from vandals, and the need for massive amounts of tissue to be stored easily in high-traffic bathrooms, but isn't there SOMETHING that can be done to make the process of removing paper from these contraptions easier? If you have the poor fortune of being one of the first users of a brand new mega-roll of toilet paper, you're fucked! Usually, you'll get one itsy bitsy square before the huge weight of the roll rips it right off. Maybe if you're fortunate enough, you can find the right angle to pull down to get a usable portion of paper, but many times, that angle causes a recoil in the roll which then makes ripping the next piece off extremely hard unless you rotate the entire roll a few times to find the loose end.  The one thing that I find the MOST annoying out of anything in a public bathroom is the sink.  Who is the idiot that created the sink where the water only comes out when you hold down the faucet?  I'd really like to know this so I can ask them WHAT THE FUCK THEY WERE THINKING! We've all used it, and no matter how often we use it, it still feels uncomfortable and unsuccessful. Sometimes you'll get lucky and find the sink where you get that precious ten-seconds of mostly-cold water before the steam just shuts off, must more often than not you get 1 - 3 seconds. Still, many times, by the time your hand moves from the button to the water spout...it's gone.   Unfortunately, without Government legislation, I don't think any of these problems will ever go away. Restroom comfort just isn't a priority in your average building. The sad fact is that to those in charge of supplying bathrooms across this country with accessories, there is one golden rule:  Buy whatever's cheapest.  One can only hope that some day in the near future, we as a people will revolt against sub-par facilities and unite in our demand for comfort, cleanliness and ease-of-use. After all, isn't this what being American is all about?

      On Friday, Marie, Jess and I went to see  urlLink On the Speakers  at the Mercury Lounge. They rocked just as hard as they did last time we saw them and sounded even tighter.  urlLink My Favorite  opened up for them, but were quite boring.  Saturday we saw "The Day After Tomorrow" which was really f'n cool. Despite the bad reviews by critics, the special effects were amazing and it was really entertaining.  Also rented "In America" and "Winged Migration" this weekend. Both were great movies.  Yank's lost yesterday...now they're only 2 1/2 games ahead of the Sox. Hopefully a solid win today will put them back to 3.

      Marie got free tickets throgh her job for the Tim Robbin's written/produced play  "Embedded."  I've always loved Tim Robbin's as an actor (although I get annoyed by his constant political ramblings), but the show was AMAZING. Tim starred in the play as well, and I've never seen anyone act so amazingly in person as I did when Tim was on stage last night. Afterwards, there was a 45 minute Q&A with Tim and this embedded  Newsweek  journalist who was in Iraq. A few of the questions asked were very interesting, but so many tools used the forum for self-promotion. One guy was telling an extremely long-winded, boring story of how he's been faxing signatures to companies to protest the Bush administration. Even worse was the idiot who offered Tim three "recommended improvements" on his play.  In unrelated news...the Yankees won and the Red Sox lost. The Yankees now have a full-game lead over the Sox in the AL East.

         The Jesus and Mary Chain:  Stoned & Dethroned :  I forgot how amazing this album is. I went to Long Island this weekend with Marie and on the car ride over I realized out of the blue that I haven't listened to this album or band for too many years. "Dirty Water," "Sometimes Always," "Come On," and many, many more.  As a side-note...I'd like to point out that the  1st place Yankees  now have the  best record in baseball .
