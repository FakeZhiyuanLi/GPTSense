      ok, so i went and saw "the notebook" today, and let me tell you, if you dont believe in love, this movie will make you believe.  this story is the most amazing love story ever.  if you go see it, make sure you bring a box of kleenex and wear waterproof mascara.  i cried quite a few times throughout the movie.  ive never read a book by nicholas sparks, but after seeing this, i think i will start.  i know this gave me a new perspective on love and relationships and knowledge not to give up on something that i want, that i know is right.  go see it and let me know what you think.

      ok, so i only have three more days of work before i actually have a day off!  My social activity has greatly decreased this month.  im used to going out at least four times a week, now i only go out one or two.  which is good, i guess.  i mean, im saving money (which i need to do considering i spend at least $200 a month on makeup alone!  its one of my vices.) and im also giving my liver time to dry out!!  now, im not so much a clubber, but if you ask me, every hour is happy hour!!  i used to have the best drinking buddy up until a month ago (he was an officer i worked with...which is why i will never date a cop!).  i mean, we would drink from 11AM until 2AM.  yeah, i can drink!  i surprise a lot of people because i can hold my own when it comes down to drinking.  my ideal day off is laying at the beach with a drink by my side.  thats where you'll find me on my days off.  wow, i cant wait until my next day off!  well, im actually running a little late right now.  im off to meet a friend for a margarita or five!!

      ok, so i've been working six days a week so far this month.  yeah, the overtime money is great, and it is helping me pay for my therapy, which i now need due to the fact that i think i've only had four days off in the past 22 days.  but oh well.  im also keeping myself out of trouble, which seems to find me everytime i go out somewhere.  im not sure why.  but luckily my coworkers are great and work is always a blast.  not to mention i get to see nice looking guys on a regular basis.  something about that police officer uniform thing really does it for me!  but the second week of july i get to go to tampa for a month for the academy.  yay! how nice it will be to get away from this boring town for a whole month, and for free, too!

      ok, so, i know i haven't been on for awhile, but this training is exhausting.&nbsp; i mean, 9 hour days really aren't fun.&nbsp; so the first week, we had to do our defense tactics, which wasnt bad.&nbsp; we also had to get cpr certified, but i already am, so that was no big deal.&nbsp; this last week, we just did bookwork, so that was really rough.&nbsp; however, we did get out early a few times.&nbsp; i have yet to go out to ybor city ( i know, im shocked too).&nbsp; but i have already gone through 3 bottles, so its not like im not having fun.&nbsp; yesterday and today, i hung out by the pool, got some sun, met some boys.&nbsp; and when i say boys, i mean boys.&nbsp; but the best part was the girl whose boyfriend was hitting on me, but failed to tell me he had a girlfriend, so to get back at him, she gives another guy her room key.&nbsp; yeah, i know.&nbsp; messed up.&nbsp; obviously at this point, im done with him, so i find the humor in it all.&nbsp; but anyway, i have to go lounge around before i go back to school tomorrow.&nbsp; its going to be another long week!!

      ok, so when you meet someone and start hanging out, you ususally at some point, discuss if it will go any further, like develop into a relationship, right?  well, when i say, "i don't want a relationship," is that clear?  you would think so.  but apparently i wasnt too clear with this guy i've been hanging out with.  we met through a mutal friend, and we've all been going out to bars, hanging out at his house.  and if i wanted to be his girlfriend, would i sit there and point out all the girls i think are pretty and tell him to go hit on them?  i dont know how blunt i can be when i say, "no relationship!"  anyway, i think i lost him as a friend today when i told him that i thought i made myself clear.  and im pretty sure that im going to lose the friend that we met through too, which sucks.  but im leaving for tampa on the 11th, and i plan on meeting up with an old friend.  not only that, even if i wasnt meeting up with him, i still wouldnt want to date this guy.  im not even over my ex yet.  its things like this that make me want to stay single for the rest of my life!!

      Ok, so IM leaving in 9 days to go to my training.  But now it's not just my training that I'm doing.  After seeing "the notebook" I realized that I have to go after what I want, or should I say who I want.  I'm just getting over a break up that occurred so suddenly, and for no rational reason at all.  I think my guy got scared and chose to run and break my heart instead of staying with me.  We were perfect together, I thought I had met my match.  Everyone else saw it too.  Everyone but him, I guess.  Anyway, I'm going to Tampa, and I have plans to meet up with an old friend of mine, who I hadn't seen in five years.  He was the one guy who always made my heart flutter, and still does.  I'm very nervous to go see him.  I'm not healed yet from my breakup, but I'm getting there slowly.  We still talk once in awhile.  It's just hard when it happens out of the blue without warning.   Black   Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay Her lace spread out before me, as her body once did All five horizons revolved around her soul As the earth to the sun Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn Ooh, and all I taught her was everything Ooh, I know she gave me all that she wore And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds Of what was everything? Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything... I take a walk outside I'm surrounded by some kids at play I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning How quick the sun can, drop away And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass Of what was everything? All the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything... All the love gone bad turned my world to black Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll ever be...yeah... Uh huh...uh huh...ooh... I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star In somebody else's sky, but why Why, why can't it be, why can't it be mine

      ok, so, this is it. i am officially off the market. this time it is for good. i stayed in tampa a little longer than anticipated. i met my match. i always said it was going to take a real man to tame me, and i met him. this guy makes me want to be a better person, he makes me better. it's amazing the way he makes me feel. No one, absolutely no one has ever had this effect on me. Even the fact that I only have two days off (thanks to the schedule change!) this month doesn't matter. He will be here on Monday. I can't wait. I will see him next month. He's arranged for me to meet the other man in my life in October. Everything is coming together. He's moving back to Tampa in January. I can move up there in February, after I've completed a year on the job. This feeling is amazing. I just know he's it. Everyone can't believe I actually found a guy who can make me settle down. I can't either. I'm the happiest I've been in the five years I've lived in fort misery!!

      ok, so, last thursday, 7-29, was great. i went and saw my husband, dave matthews. he never lets me down! every show i've ever seen of his, which i've seen a million, is always great. he did a lot of classics, some covers, some from his album, and some new stuff. it was great. not only that, but i met a really great guy. it's just too bad he lives in tampa. well, actually he's moving to gainesville. but he is wicked nice and i've actually been hanging out with him since the show. we had a great time this weekend in ybor city. we went out both friday and saturday. we hit The Green Iguana and Coyote Ugly. I was unsure about Coyote Ugly, but it turns out it was one of my favorite bars to go to. I had a blast there. Unfortunately this is my last week up here and I have my big exam on Friday, so I probably won't see him too much. and i'm kinda bummed about that. I'm supposed to go home on Friday, but I'm hoping he'll say I can stay at this place for a night so I can hang out with him one last time. What's good is that one of his friends lives in fort myers, so maybe he'll visit him before he moves up to gainesville. and i suppose I could always go visit him there, because gainesville is another great place to party!! so, im kinda nervous about my exam. i mean, i have to pass it, so i guess i need to start studying. oh, and to top it all off, i go back to work on Sunday, only to work Sunday-Friday for the whole month of August. That means four days off a month. Lucky me. yeah, right! so, i think instead of taking the overtime, i might just take the four days vacation that i could earn for working the overtime. that way i can go to gainesville and see my new friend. and one of his friends (our mutual friend that introduced us) is celebrating his birthday in vegas on 10-31. a bunch of people are going for the weekend, and i might just go with them. i mean, i wanted to go for my birthday in november, so it's looking really good to me. and then i might go to chicago in september for a weekend to see a friend of mine, but we'll see. that's a whole other story for you. well, i'm exhausted. i had a long weekend of partying and i need to get to bed. i have a long week ahead of me!!
