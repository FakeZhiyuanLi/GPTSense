      Why can't politicians drink caffeinated soda and be hyper?   I think best when I am hyper.  I look awake when I am hyper.  Politicians always look tired.  Why not drink a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi and be hyper?  You notice I am stereotyping a whole lot.  Do I care?  I do not care.  Why?  Because I'm thirsty for more Pepsi.

      Hmm.  Lindows is this new operating system for PC's that is supposed to be an opponent for Windows.  Windows is taking Lindows to court because they say Lindows sounds too much like Windows.  Either Microsoft is worried Lindows may be a formidable opponant or they are simply trying to make some extra cash.  I feel a tad bit sorry for Lindows.  But only a tad.  After all, Lindows is having a 'Hack into the X-Box contest'.  X-Box is made by Microsoft.  I find the whole ordeal mildly funny.  But only mildly.  It's almost more scary and sad than funny.  Where is the line drawn on what lawsuits can be about?  What if I get sued?   Like I said - It's funny, but mainly just plain scary.

      It's almost funny to see newspaper writers complaining about bias in other papers when they themselves write with a bias.  Also funnily ironic are the letters to the editor in the mailbag section of news magazines:    "The writer of 'such and such an article' states that President Bush is a liar.  President Bush is NOT a liar...The author of this article should at least try to back his accusations up with fact!"    Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the author of this letter not backing up his or her statement with fact, just as he or she accused the journalist of doing?

      My hair is multi-colored, but a lot of people say that it has a distinct reddish tint.  I have heard of countless people being made fun of because of their red hair.  I've read that red hair often belongs to those with tender skin.  I've also heard that red haired people have blood sugar problems.  So why the statement 'Red-heads have more fun'?  I suppose it's another attempt to raise self esteem.  But it sure seems like a weak one to me.

      Some people pop pimples.  Some people only have pimples as teens.  Some people have pimples all their life.     But as I type this, I realize:  'PIMPLE' is a very funny word!

      Often times some of my friends talk about how it stinks to have to do work.  And I almost agree.  But hey:  You're gonna be working when you're off on your own and you'll be having to make yourself do it.  Why not practice now so when you are off on your own you can actually be organized and have a good work ethic?

      I've just begun to notice everyone talks and complains about everything and do nothing to change it.  I started to complain about that but then thought about how that would be me whining about whiners and that doesn't sound good!  People have a right to do certain things.  If the things they are doing are not morally wrong, why complain?  It's annoying to complain for the complainer and those around him/her.  But a lot of people complain about a political figure who complains about things and does nothing about them.  Yet the people who complain about political figures often don't vote or else they ONLY vote and don't support the political canidate that they are rooting for.  And yet I'm complaining about them when I can't vote and am not actively involved in politics!  Now listen to me!  I'm complaining about myself complaining about complainers who complain about complainers!  My head hurts now!

                My last post had MAJOR spelling errors.  This one may too.  I have spell check.  I didn't use it.  Do I care?  I should.  I need to practice good spelling.  Right.  I should go back and edit it to make it look nice.  And I plan to.  But I know I never will.

      It's so very scary.  What I write in my BLOG my affect my life.  What if a future employer reads it and decides he doesn't like me because of what I've typed.  What I say today may change who I marry!  If I buy name brand soda or not might decide the fate of a factory worker in Texas.    I'm scared.    I'm so VERY scared.

      A book review -       Currently I'm reading Sherlock Holmes.  I have the 'Complete Treasury' or something like that.  To be sure, I haven't finished the whole thing, but I did finish the section called 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'  They are rather odd mysteries.  Some I like better than others.  I do love, however, how no matter what the character, even if it's a minor character with two lines that never appears again, the author makes that person believable.  I do find Holmes annoying at times, and I love and pity poor Watson.  Always, in the mysteries, the author withholds one vital clue.  You can generally figure out what's going on, but not the particulars.   Anyway, that's my take on things.

      I'm worried.  What if people who see the name Natory think they are supposed to pronounce it Nat-or-EE?   It's supposed to be NATE-Or-EE.  I hope they get it right.

      It's SO hard to love people.  My pastor was talking about it this morning at church and I was thinking about certain people IN the church who drive me mad!  And it's not just me, either!  They TRY to be annoying and brag and show off and EVERYONE dislikes them.......But it's my job to love them.......

      It's funny how sleep works. Sometimes I can go on little sleep and wake up in the morning super-charged. Other times I sleep for a long time and in the morning I am groggy as groggy can be. I hope, once I get older, this will stop. I have this big, dark circles under my eyes that won't go away. And now, it's only 9:30-ish, yet I'm tired! Go figure!

      I can SO understand why some people get mad about downloading music, and why they are cracking down on the people who do it.  Some of those things can make or break something for some.  For instance:  movies.  Some movies barely break even, often because people go to see the movie out of curiosity.  If they can download it off of the web and don't like it, they don't go see the movie.  For some movies that can be really bad.  For others, like big movies such as the Lord of the Rings, it makes little difference.  Then there's music.  I've bought CD's (Yes, I'm admitting) because I downloaded MP3s, liked them, and wanted to hear the music.  It's tough.  And what about TV shows?  It's possible to record and trade them, and it's not illegal.  On the other hand, I've heard lots of porn is distributed through file swapping programs like Kazaa, so that's not cool either.  It's tough.  Some of those things on those file sharing programs, like Kazaa, ought to be shared.....It's even legal!  Other files are illegal, but it's common sense to share them and nobody cares.  Then there are the files in question.  They are illegal, and people take sides.  Some people think it's okay to share them, others don't.  Then there are the ones MOST people agree should not be shared.  That's a broad generalization, and obviously SOME people think it's okay, but, at least, most people  I  know agree that porn is bad.   Anyway, that's my take on things!

      Well, I just got back from a wiener roast at my grandfather's retirement home.  'Old people' can be so cool, yet so wierd.  But, of course, that's true of everybody.  I do hate it when people automatically assume that older people are idiots.  Sometimes they can be 'dense'......But again, that's true of everyone.  I read something about the generation gap the other day.  Apparently it is 'closing'......Though how they decided that, I don't know.

      Why must people steriotype people?  It's so agrivating when people steriotype people without reason or fact.  Yet I cannot complain about it to the fullest extent because then I would be steriotyping.  Yet some steriotyping is necessary and good, so long as the person who is steriotyping gives reason.  But I don't have time to give reason.  My attitude reflects the attitude of so many others.  I can't say like who, though, because then I would be steriotyping.

      Shy people tend to not be these nice people who are gentle and kind.  Shy people tend to be really rather cruel or even vicious.  Take my little sister for example.  Everyone says she's cute and then she goes and hides and blushes.  It's all part of her evil plan.  Just yesterday she  broke  my toe!  She can be down right cruel!

      Articles for The Voice have been keeping me busy lately.  Like one on Lord of the Rings fans, the one on an exchanged student from Germany, and the one on teen clowns.  I'm just now finishing up one on a teen handbell choir, Ring of Fire.  And I'm working on a story about a local showchoir, City Starz!  I love journalism.  :)

      Everyone's seen it.  And if they haven't, they ought to.  Return of the King is the best movie ever, hands own.  I got the goosebumps after and during it.   And if it doesn't win Best Picture, the academy will have admitted to being the stuck up snobs that they are.  Remember Michael Moore?  He made a few nasty remarks about President Bush?  Some people booed him, some clapped.  Fine.  Did you hear what he said afterwards?  Something along the lines of: Most of the people who booed where in the balcony.  What does that mean?  The balcony holds the common folk, the non movie stars.  So now we know what Hollywood's opinion of us REALLY is.

      A gem of a movie series, Spiderman and it's sequel are inspirational to geeks everywhere.  Thus, they are an inspiration to me.  Peter Parker is role model, a man who is willing to sacrifice what he wants for a greater cause.  Mary Jane Watson shows us that your sixth grade crush might turn into love someday, that you should never give up your innocent dreams.  Harry Osbourne shows us that villians are people too, that we need to watch out or we too might sink to depths we thought unimaginable.  Spiderman...Spiderman...He does what any spider can.

      Step 1: Just Watch Look at it all!  The Democratic National Convention is on 24/7 in the newspapers, on the TV and on the radio.  It's positive coverage, too.  Watch and see.  Step 2: Just Wait When the Republican National Convention rolls around, will it get as much coverage?  As much positive talk from the news reporters and anchors?  Wait and see.  Step 3: Just Think Bias?  Think about.  It's there and you can't deny it.

      Yahoo Webmail - It's free, it's served me well and I like it. Google Webmail - It's free, it's new and it's hosted by a site three thousand times cooler than Yahoo.    Just awhile back I changed my email from a long string of numbers and letters to a short, crisp name: Natoryy.  If I change again, it could be annoying for people.  Think of all the emails I'd have to send, all the sites I'd have to inform of my address.  Plus, I still check my old email now and then to make sure I didn't get anything there that I need to see.  If I switch to G-Mail, I'd have three addresses to check and at different sites no less.  Plus, G-Mail just isn't as user friendly, isn't as nice.  So the choice seems obvious, right?  Wrong.  Google is so cool...The little guy standing up to the big corporation: Yahoo.  Plus, Google, I hear, may be having money troubles.  I oughtta support them, a cool site, with my hits.  But then, the people who own Google are rich enough as it is...I don't need to worry about them since I don't even know them.  Plus, Yahoo has feelings as well.    For now, Yahoo will stay my home.  I have a Google account set up for later if I ever need it.  Currently, though, change is looking to be a bad thing.  At least in the case of email.  Anyway, that's my take on things.
