      Wrapping themselves in antique patchwork quilts, familiar pillows and throws, warmed by the glow of an aging fire, Ethan and Sara watched their weekly evening nature show. Loosely seated in the bush and plains of African veldt, the show outlined a local pride of lions, their daily rituals, feasts and familial affairs. Towards the final minutes of the program a new lioness was introduced. Alone, outcast and without any pride of her own the lioness attempted to join the pride they had come to know. Knowing if she didn’t find a pride to accept her she would die of starvation among the hunters and hunted of the African veldt.  Tears welled up in Ethan’s eyes as she was attacked, tormented and run out of the familiar circle of cats. She had never seen him cry as he did when he watched her. The apparition had once again appeared and she felt this time it would not simply go away.   Sara could not understand why he had to go and had resigned herself that there were parts of him she would never truly know. They had been together almost two years and the dark, secret lonely side of him appeared, again, as an apparition she could never seem to see. Ethan had never been to Africa, he never expressed any sort of interest in the savanna or any kind of desire to go there. She would never forget the moment the lioness appeared to him. This time she was witness to his heart, the apparitions and that vacancy within him. Haunting him, keeping him from the warm light of her love and the possibility of their life together, the apparition took him once again.   Research  He had become obsesses. It was as if he could solve her problem he would solve his own. The trouble with these thoughts was he didn’t even know what his problem was. The symptoms had become glaringly obvious over the last few years but the problem had remained hidden. Detached from him yet present in everything, everyone and anything he remotely tried to use to forget it.   Camp on the edge of the Veldt  As he landed in Africa, translucent sheets of monsoon rain fell upon the reclining golden-sloped hills and valleys of the veldt. Sensing a tortured heavy need, somewhere, far off, away from himself, Ethan began his search for the lioness. Leaving Sara, without any real reason why, the mists of guilt began envelope him as he waited for his luggage. Questioning why he was half way around the world looking for something he couldn’t even explain Ethan left the airport to find his room and the group who would bring him to the unfamiliar her. They were researching the deaths of a large percentage of the African lions. Most dies from a form of feline leukemia which has spread to most of the prides on the plain. The group from the University of Nairobi was hoping to find a small group of untagged, untested prides in the hopes of stopping the inevitable further spread of this horrifying disease. Ethan heard of the group’s mission through a friend at the University of Washington.  Seth had traveled to Kenya the previous year on a personal trip and learned of the lion’s plight through his guide. It was only by chance that the topic of the lions ever came up between Ethan and Seth. “What the heck are you doing her old boy” slapping Ethan on the back as he studied at the UW’s Natural Sciences library. “Not much on these walls for a number cruncher like you, huh.” “Hey, how in the hell did they let you in here. I thought they would have escorted you to the gate after graduation you fat bastard.” Seth wasn’t fat but the euphemism was from a film they both held near and dear to them. Anytime they met on campus it used to be a race to see who could slide it into conversation first. Seth and Ethan were in the same class but being two different majors they weren’t too close anymore. Freshman year they lived down the hall from one another in McMahon hall, a dorm on campus. Partying was the major of choice for most of the freshman dormies and Ethan and Seth were no exception. Seeing him there in the library, four years after graduation that bright spring day was no less than an outright shock.   Back home, the truth is revealed and Kiah is alive and well  Reading his letters seemed to keep Ethan closer. The smell of his hands, skin scent upon weathered, traveled pages keep her warm these last few wintered weeks. Since he had left, Sara tried to return to some semblance of a normal life, lying, trying to convince herself he was OK, they were OK and he would be home soon. Lying. Friends came and went. Passing the time with dinners, gossip, wine, big bowls of buttered salty popcorn and bad rented movies. “You have to get on with your life” Rebecca pleaded as they finished up the last of the Frangos and pretzels while watching the last few scenes of Steel Magnolias. “I can’t understand why you don’t just send those damm letters back, throw his shit in a storage locker and move on”. Tears welling up in her eyes now, not wanting to fight but still not ready to let go “Because I love him dammit! Why is that so hard to understand. Isn’t that the way it’s supposed to go…I mean isn’t that enough”. Knowing Sara didn’t really want her answer “It should be enough Sara but it isn’t that simple with him. You know the issues. You know what happened. Do you honestly think you can trust him again? Do you still love him despite that?” And there it was, she had gone there and it was done. Looking into the ratty Kleenex in hands she didn’t seem to even recognize anymore, Sara gave one more pleading glance to Rebecca in the chair beside her and the discussion was over. Back to the movie, the two women sat in total silence until the whirring rewind speed noise of the VCR snapped them out of the absent daze they had fallen into. Rebecca slowly picked up the living room, placed the movie back in its plastic box kissed Sara on the cheek and left.  It was Thursday. As she put the last of his over read, tattered letters away in the musty yellow cigar box under the couch their ritual nature show came on TV. Digging three of their four clickers out of strewn, fattened pillows and cushions, Sara found the TV’s remote and quickly turned the show off. She didn’t feel like watching what it was that sent her love away from her. It wasn’t the show itself Sara resented. Ethan had wandered before, the show was a reminder that he had left, again.  The two had been together a little under a year when she realized Ethan’s heart had serious reservations about where their relationship was headed. They weren’t living together at this point but it had been discussed. One winter Sunday afternoon Ethan suggested they see a movie and get some dinner afterwards. Nothing unusual, he liked to be out among people, moving feeling others around him, moving. “How about a movie and some dinner? There is this film downtown I heard was really good, what do you think?” “Sounds good, I have most of my work caught up here” motioning to the desk in her home office,  “Why don’t you check out the times, I’ll change, and we can go?”  After some quick brushes of blush, a couple of combs through the hair and the usual Seattle sweater and fleece jacket Sara met him at the door. The drive was quiet. A few small comments on the weather, his latest work project and a few questions on her newest revisions. Ethan worked for a local investment firm, a smaller firm, where he had the respect of his peers, clients and a good chance at a partnership within the next five years. Ethan was a company man. It was one of the things she loved about him, his sense of duty. That personal responsibility most men she knew seemed so casual with, as if keeping your word were the equivalent of a mood swing. Switching careers, relationships, homes, cars you name it as if it was some sort of sport. Racing to get to some level, at the expense of their word, these men would sacrifice that part of a man that makes him a man. Gazing out the rainy window into the usual dark, cold Seattle night Sara began to feel a slow, grinding knot building in her stomach. Something was coming, rolling towards them slowly, hiding behind the rain and within the clouds which hung over the city most of these early months of the year. “Here we are” he quipped as he opened her door and shut it behind her.  Dazed by the now pregnant knot in her stomach and feeling ill by the clutch of its hidden motives Sara murmured a low “thank you” as Ethan took her arm and let her to the theatre. The film was your basic chick flick, something she could just as well have waited to rent but Ethan was kind enough to take her to it just the same. Enjoyable, funny with the usual three Kleenex scenes, the film fulfilled her annual touchy-feely-girl-film fix for the year. As they stood to wait for their row to exit she suddenly knew where the knot came from and who it belonged to. Ethan spotted her first, sensing the hair raising chill stinging down his spine, Sara glanced the direction he was looking. Meeting the gaze of a woman she had never met and never planned on wanting to. Quickly, hoping Sara hadn’t noticed, he sat back down pulling her into the seat next to him.  “Lets just sit and wait for everyone to leave, maybe we can sneak into the next showing.” forcing a smirk hoping his stunned knee jerk reaction wasn’t too obvious. “That’s her isn’t it” Sara shot back. “I just want to know if that was her”. She really didn’t want to know but before the words could take the air from her lungs and pass from her lips to him she knew. That look on his face and she knew. The ding-dong doorbell of the pizza guy snapped her out of the bleak memory and she left the couch and remotes to get dinner. There, on the sofa, alone Sara ate one piece of bad delivery cardboard pizza, then two. She never could make it past two pieces, even if Ethan was there to goad her on. Shifting for a more comfortable spot and pulling the TV clicker from the small of her back she inadvertently hit the power switch.  Kiah filled the screen. Bloodied, bruised, broken and howling to family she no longer had, the lioness pleaded for someone, anyone to comfort her in the darkened chill of the African night. Sara saw the lioness as he had, needing a savior and not realizing it. Calling out to the night, not knowing why but sensing somewhere deep within her, in that place which is both transparent and opaque, she needed. Sara watched the last few moments of the program fearing what her gut had told her so many times before. She would lose. In nature, as in life, animals lose and die and it’s cruel. Kiah would die that night on the veldt and the love of Sara’s life would be lost to her forever. Ethan would never be able to save her, to save himself. He would never look into her eyes, visualizing himself in her and in doing so, save them both.      The wrong pride  Ethan and the group continue looking for Kiah. Mainly he is looking for her while the researchers find un-tagged prides to document, photograph, tag and take blood for testing back at the lab at the University of Kenya.

      some days slipped by like stillborn thoughts on an empty bus, going nowhere with no one to share the emptiness. others reminded her of those naked, high school, can't-remember-the-last-day-I-went-to-class dreams. daily finding herself frightened, vulnerable and alive despite the overwhelming craving to crawl in a dark hole and keep in the warm. each night as her head hit those lonely pillows she begged for the next sunrise to be kinder than the last. the problem was that each sunrise was kinder than the last, she just couldn't see it. there were three things, factors, in her life by which she gauged each day. Money, friends/family and men. generally the one with the worst outlook of the day was deemed to be the most important, at least for that day. usually it went like this. if she was lucky Chloe would get out of the house by 7:30, her parents house that is, and that was without a shower or coffee.

      I washed off the smell of you this morning  Memory lingers among the shame and pain of betrayal  There are four wounds I have left in you  They have names I do not know but focus, I imagine  I feel sick playing the moments in time  I am sickened in my heart yet I find myself   on familiar ground

      Does butter live in heaven or hell. And while we are talking death, where does diet Coke live. I only say these things because wherever these two small gastrointestinal sins live is where I want to go. This came up as I sat in front of a Saturday night fire, a few candles with stir-fry out of a bag and some rice. Everything is better with butter so back to the kitchen, next to the toaster, in the little dish with a cow on it. Spreading the yellow, melted now hardened because I kept it in the microwave too long, salty concoction upon my steamy meat and veggie dish I wondered. Are the good foods found upstairs or downstairs?   As a kid I was deprived of the good food. For some reason my mom had only “healthy” food in the house. No sugar, Cheerios, Grape Nuts, wheat nut bread (whatever that is) and pork chops so hard and cardboard like I used to stuff them in my socks only to throw out in the rockery after I was excused from “dinner”. I wasn’t allowed to spend my allowance on candy so to indulge my sweet tooth I used to drop tiny droplets of water into the brown sugar, lay them out on the counter to dry and pretend it was candy like my friends had. Candy with a receipt. I understand that she was a working mom. I came home from school every day, took the spare house key from the mailbox and sat down to the current episode of Star Blazers. At 3:30 Monday thru Friday I had to call down the Federal Building to let her know I was home. It was on this call I received the instructions for dinner du jour.  “Take out the pork chops, fill the sink with hot water and leave them in it till I get home, and do your homework”.  At least we only had pork chop once a week, but they were horrible. I thought I was so clever, stuffing my dark blue JC Penney socks with warm greasy meat, waiting to ask to be excused so I could go play outside. I never asked to be excused on casserole night or spaghetti night, only the eve of pork and bone.

      If there is a time and a place for everything than what is this time and place for? Is this the time and place  for somebody else’s something, or is it mine. Is my time and place hiding  in the pocket lint of somebody else’s frock or pocket.  When I wake up tomorrow  will those things, which  were supposed to happen to me, be  happening to someone else. This is  all really just blithering. Peeling away  the limp, curled edges of the onion to get  to the bitter fruit inside.   If everything I have done,  seen,  eaten,  fucked  and left  was supposed to happen, supposed  to lead me here,  when does it end?   When do you get  to that place in your life where you stop in the middle of the sidewalk and say, this is it, I’m here. All  the places,  and seconds,  and faces  and ice cream cones added up  spit out this sum.   Does is happen that way, or do you get the joke  on the last wave of air to enter your lungs, passing the death breath on its way.

      despite all you were trained to believe, throughout  your patterned little childhood, you are not the asshole at the end of my rainbow. in those shared boyhood showers,  at football camp and the wigwams of cub and boy scouts,  they lied to you. they all lied to you. female doesn’t need a penis.  cunt can get a job, buy the good wine and eat all the fucking  carbohydrates, fruit, butter and cheese she wants, without the assistance  or company of your “manhood”. false assumptions make idiots of all us.  woman, for not listening to our guts when they screamed at us  over hundred dollar dinners and hollow conversation. man for  believing all the lies, spoon-fed, of your youth, that we were somehow  incomplete or handicapped without your furry presence. that we all wanted  your love, time and for fuck sake “relationships”. relationships are based  on the sharing of stories, bitter truths and blood, not some fecund rubbing,  scathing and heating of horny skin…don’t flatter us with your attentions,  you are not only barking up the proverbial “wrong tree”,  most of you aren’t even in the right forest!

      Most of the time I imaging my life is full, satisfying and mostly complete. By the time I have convinced that I'm actually ok with the status of my selfs existence it becomes glaringly apparent my life is boring.  get up, shower, go to work, home for lunch, work, home, ride the horse, dinner, back home again, and that's it. Vanilla! Not even vanilla bean with those curious little black dots we all want to believe are vanilla spots. No, my existence in this smallish suburb of Seattle is almost imperceptibly painful.   So do I choose to do anything about it? Do I go out and get different friends, add more friends to the catalog of acquaintances in my cell, take a walk out of this box I've created myself in. No, I jus sit here at my laptop and put it down for anyone else to read and begin to convince myself that actually is a step out of the proverbial ice cream dish.
