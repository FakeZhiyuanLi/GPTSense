       urlLink press release   It has been a long time that I have been planning to buy a GPS. The last time I cursed myself for not having bought one was approximatively a month ago when I went to Germany for a "business trip":  I had to go to  urlLink Kalsruhe  and going by train or plane would have taken as long as going by car, so I took the "rig".  Going there should not have been a problem: I used a  urlLink trip planning web site .  Practically, however, it was quite difficult to read the map while driving.  Once you are on a highway, it is psychologically difficult to exit to "nowhere" (because your trip planner itinerary says so) whereas your final destination is announced further away on the road you are about to leave.  I quickly realized that staying on that highway would cost me 100 Kilometers more... But I did!  I finally arrived with an extra 40 minutes on the chrono and luckily found, in less than 10 minutes, the hotel where my room was booked...  When I headed back home, things were a bit different: I had not printed the "reverse trip" and had no access to the Internet anymore. My only clues were my paper map and the compass that is built in my car.  Total tally: 170 Km and 2 hours more than it should have been...  Right now, I am slowly putting some money aside to buy one of those GPS asap, hence my interest in the press release above.

      If you know  urlLink Ghost in the Shell , then you will be delighted to hear that GITS 2 will be out soon. The trailer gives much hope on the quality of the movie (but hey... That's the ultimate objective of a trailer, isn't it?) and the graphical work is very impressive, for what can be seen.  Check out  urlLink    for all the important links.  You can also go to the Ghost in the Shell fan list by clicking on the banner at the bottom right of this page.  All this is quite worth mentioning as the name of this Blog was directly inspired by GITS :-)

      I was having lunch, sitting in a rapid restauration service with a clear view of the street when the  urlLink thing  passed silently, dodging people walking by.  Its driver (rider?) was a male (caucasian) definitely over 30.  He was wearing a grey suit (Eurocrat?) and carying two plastic hand bags in one hand, while driving with the other.  What struck me was the absence of noise.  I believe I will see more and more of them now (especially during summer on the coast) and that the hype is hitting the country.

      Back in 1996 I was playing an online multiplayer game known as subspace. To give a very unapproximative description I would say that it feels like Asteroids except that you do not shoot at pieces of rocks in space but at other players. Of course, you can have team mates and that is where the real fun is.  A great aspect of the game is online chatting! While playing, you can chat with all the other people currently present in the Zone.  Now the great thing is that Continuum is currently free.   urlLink SubSpaceHQ.Com - SubSpace/Continuum Online Gaming

       urlLink The Uptime Project at The mrEriksson Network  lets you register your host(s) and have them send uptime information to a central database.  Basically, it has no real practical use (of course, one could argue with this statement) but I find it fun.

      I cannot stress this enough.  I am currently in the process of gathering all the proofs about what is said in my resume and it is a damn painfull process. My current employer (international organisation) will give me a 3 to 4 years contract but he is asking for  everything .  So follow this advice: keep all the following kind of documents, put somewhere safe and scan them as soon as you receive them:       Diplomas     Military service papers     Any kind of attestation saying that you have done something for a certain period of time     Engagement contracts     Salary files    Make sure that you have a copy for everything that you put in your resume.

      While checking  urlLink slashdot , I stumbled about an  urlLink article  highlighting the  urlLink Atomic Veterans web site . The site contains over 600 personal accounts of US personnel who participated in the various atomic bomb testings that took place in the US after WWII. The amount of information is quite impressive and some of those memories are appalling. A must read...

       urlLink    Just got my M1009 back. It spent the last 6 months at the garage... The only problem is that it spent them outside... I think it's about time I take care of the thing.  Right now the interior is in a quite poor state (moisture has accumulated in some places) and the exterior has several rusty spots. First tasks will be to empty it completely, clean it up thoroughly and apply some anti-corrosion treatment as soon as possible.

      A big thanks to  urlLink Faith  for her kindness. I was browsing profiles and watched for people having the same interests as mine and while looking for people interested in  urlLink flying , I stumbled upon Faith.  In her BLog, she was saying that she had spare GMail invites and I dropped her a couple of lines asking for one. She quickly replied et voil√†...  Thanks! :-)

      It's been a long time since I haven't put my butt in the glider.     Normally it should have been this WE but I couldn't go to the field because of a birthday party this afternoon. Then comes the bbq this evening (10 people expected).  Well, I guess it will be next week.

      Today was the official beginning of the summer holidays here. The massive exodus has started and highways are jammed in the southern part of the country.  I will continue to go to work and boost my productivity: less people here, less meetings, less stupid phone calls, less unplannified requests and less time spent commuting.

      Ok, I curse myself for not having taken my camera... Hence I have no picture of the event. Anyway, this is worth noting here: my 2 years and 8 months daughter made her first flight in our glider. She went with her mom and a friend (Fred). The flight only lasted 10 mins because there were no thermals but she enjoyed it a lot her mom said... I'll start saving money for her first "stage" in around 12 years :-)

      I discovered multi-players games back around the mid nineties when we would spend numerous hours on DOOM with my co-workers, before going home (except for the CEO: we could hear him training all day in his office, as he was always taking a beating from us, the developpers).  Then I came to  urlLink subspace , on my own (I mean on the Internet) while we did a lot of  urlLink Starcraft  and  urlLink Descent  on our LAN.  I wish we were back then as I stumble upon this Unreal Tournament Modification:  urlLink Alien Swarm .  It seems to have all the ingredients I was (am? :-) ) looking for in those games, Co-Op being the major one. I cannot deny the influence of  urlLink Aliens  also, which was one of my favorite movies at that time.  Unfortunately, one needs an Unreal Tournament installation to play it and I am from the generation before (I mean, I never had the hardware nor the time to buy and install it, being drawn by more serious problems at the time).  I'll keep it marked as "to try one of these days"... Only have to get a grab on an Unreal Tournament install...

      Well, here it is: the glider I am co-owner of:  urlLink     I'll post images taken during my flights in a near future (it still takes a hell long time to post pictures in BLogs, IMHO). This frame was taken 2 years ago when Titane was taking some friends on their "maiden" flights. They are waiting for the tow plane to start the take off.
