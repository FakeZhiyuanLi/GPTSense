        I'm worried.&nbsp; I watched "Bowling for Columbine" tonight and have seen "Fahrenheit 9/11" twice.&nbsp; I'm worried because Michael Moore has somehow become attractive to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;This really does worry me.&nbsp; I even noticed that he&nbsp;wears a wedding ring...&nbsp;         A friend of mine&nbsp;recently went&nbsp;looking for love and thought he had found it via the internet, some 2,000 miles from here.&nbsp; So he bought love a round-trip ticket&nbsp;to&nbsp;the Silicon Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had spent hours on the phone together.&nbsp; They&nbsp;were soulmate's - he was sure of it.&nbsp; She's exactly what he's been searching for.&nbsp; She is a transgender.&nbsp;&nbsp;I admit I can be a bit naive, so I asked&nbsp;what that meant, exactly, not wanting to leave it to my imagination.&nbsp; And stalling for time while my brain processed that this also meant that my straight friend, who I had once had a quick oral-sex-fantasy about, (he has a tongue that rivals the lead singer for Kiss...)&nbsp;was not straight.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;

       My cell phone was disconnected this week.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a member of a family plan, but I'm thinking that I've just been disowned.&nbsp; My ex was paying for it, and even though he's not very good at paying things on time, I expected it to be on the next day or sooner until I called and found out that the outstanding bill is&nbsp;$853...    &nbsp;  I'm sure I've developed a brain tumor.&nbsp; He'll have to turn the phone back on since I'll be in and out of the hospital from here on.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Well, I don't really want it back -&nbsp; I'm sure that I was bound to crash into some poor soul because I haven't mastered the hands-free theory just yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Now, I admit I may have had a tiny bit to do with the size of the bill.&nbsp; I have a friend in Washington, who I haven't heard from in a while.&nbsp; In fact, I wanted him to be just a tiny bit more than a friend...&nbsp; So when the conversation heated up, well, we talked for two hours...&nbsp; He did most of the talking.&nbsp; I managed to figure out the hands-free thing that night.    &nbsp;

      I've lost eight pounds in nine days. I've given up a twenty-plus-year-old addiction to regular Pepsi and switched to diet. This, of course, was no ordinary addiction. This was a replacement for food - I was truly a Pepsi-fueled human. I woke up with one and went to bed with one. And had quite a few in between. Now, I'm eating - food - and learning how to chew again. Oh, and now I know why people need dental floss... Damn stuff gets stuck in between my teeth... I guess it's a miracle that I still have teeth...  I have no regrets, though. This is the kind of triumph that everyone needs in their life. To give something up because it's not good for you - even though you love it, well, let's just say that I'm sure my remaining two, okay, three - addictions will be easier to beat now that I have felt the joy of victory.
