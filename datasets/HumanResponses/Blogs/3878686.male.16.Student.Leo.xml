      Ok lets try this agian seeing I forgot to save the first one! but anyways...! Wow what a day! It was quite interesting! I will just start from the top! Well I woke up around 9:45 this morning after going to bed around 2:30! I tried to go to sleep but I just couldnt do it! Well i went downstairs and felt a little shaky so i went and checked my bloodsugars and they were a little lower than they usually were! they were 90! thats actually not a bad reading its just lower than i normally am! Well I got on the computer after I ate and stuff! and started talking to selena's sister ange...I have learned quickly ever since i met her that she is a really kewl person and I really good advice giver! She and i finally got selena to go golfing! Selena me, ange, and ange's husband dave are going on the 23rd of july! it will be so much fun! I might be a little tired from mini band camp! But it will be fun just because selena will be golfing! Well after I finished talking to ange... dan asked me if I wanted to go to wal mart and i said yes i was gonna get something but then decided not to and then it turned out to be kinda boring! but oh well! well after that dan and I went to mcdonalds for lunch and selena showed up! which made me uberly happy! well after that we went swimming at selena's house! that was fun! then after we were swimming we went and watched a movie called stuck on you! that movie is kinda boring the second time you watch it cause you have already seen it but it was still funny in the parts that were funny! well then I came home got on the computer and then got bored so I decided to practice my shortgame for golf! Well I did that for about 15 minutes and then got bored because i figured that golf is really boring when you do it without the person that you have been doing it with for a while! that person happens to be my dad and I miss him so much right now! I dont think anyone knows how much I miss him right now! great now I am starting to get teary eyed! he has done so much for me and I just cant every repay him for what he has done! I just miss him alot! great now im all teary eyed and i am being dumb! but i guess thats what happens when you miss someone that much! Well after I finished with my golf I came in and started talking to jessie for a while on the computer and then everyone started getting on! I met two really awesome guys named travis and Jay they are really kewl and I cant wait to get to know them better! I have decided that its time to renew my faith in god and start going to church agian! Well i really really want to do this program called fully alive next year but im just not sure that people really want me to do it! but who knows?!?! anyways... well i started talking to selena and I asked her what she is going to do on saturday because she has so many people asking her to do things, and I feel bad because she told me that she was going to go with me, and i feel bad because i just think that she is thinking that I am trying to keep from other people and thats the last thing that i am trying to do I promise! well after that she seemed a little aggetated and i asked her if anything was wrong and then she told me that she was just frustrated that she couldnt do everything with everyone! Well then we all started talk and I got kinda bored with that but kept talking after i closed the convorsation once! Well that brings me to now and nothing is going on now except me talking to kayle! I think that I am going to wrap this up! but first I must pray...dear father I just want to let you know what and awesome person you created when he made selena I love her more than anything in the world and I really hope that I stay with her for the rest of my life! I just want you to watch over her lord and take the best care of her as well as me and in gos name amen! Well i guess all thats left if good-bye and god bless!

      Well today was not sucha great day! well first off i get up and start to plan things with my golfing coach and then decide that i want to go with my friends nathan instead! Well we went and I shot the best round of my life! I was very happy! but i didnt tell selena that because i just figured she would be like oh thats nice whatever! and i mean its a really big accomplishment i have never shot three over par ever since i started playing gol fi thas been 6 or maybe even 10 over and i just did plane good today! Well then we were getting ready to leave for our DCI thing and well my mom ended up screwing up so that we didnt go and that made me so mad because I let selena down so much and all of that! Well after that i invited Nathan over to spend the night in which we went to movie gallery and got "welcome to mooseport" and "suburban nightmare" they both look like really good movies! Well then we went to see Dodgeball which is a hillarious movie but jolei kept being stupid and I just wasnt happy with her! Well i think that im done now! wait gotta pray...dear father please bless selena and her family bless nathan and his family and may everyone sleep well tonight father amen! Well all good night!
