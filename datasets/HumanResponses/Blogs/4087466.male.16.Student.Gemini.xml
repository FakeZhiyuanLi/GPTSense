          Sabado ngayon...and as usual, basketball ako in the morning. Sayang nga lang, kulang kami ng isa so 4 on 4 na whole court kami. After that, 1 on 1 kami ni Jason.  Dun sa whole court na game, MALABO. Nung umpisa, lahat ng tao bumababa pa ng court. Tapos change court, tinamad na.  BAHO  kasi ni  Asim Kalaboy aka Stackie Stackhouse.  Dahil sa kanya, di na naayos yung laro. BAHO niya kasi! HAHAHAHAHAHA!! ANyways, dahil din kay Kalaboy, natalo team nila. Pasalamat siya kakampi niya si Ralph. At pasalamat lalo siya kasi pinasahan pa siya!!! Ok naman performance ko today. Usual steals and fast-break points pa rin. Occasional jump shot. Point-guard training ako today, so puro pasa naman muna (may assist ako kay Jason!!).  Sa 1 on 1 naman, PAGURAN. Pare-pareho pa ginagawa ko- drive sa kanan, lay-up o hook shot. Ok lang yun, si Jason din naman eh (drive sa kanan, lay-up). Ganyan talaga ang buhay, minsan MALABO. HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

              Boring araw ko. Listening to music gets boring when you listen to the same old songs. Playing basketball gets boring when you do the same moves (puro jump shot...haha...). And eventually, life gets boring when the same things happen. This is my first post, sana lang di pare=pareho malagay ko everytime I post. *GO LA SALLE*

      Class night na bukas! HAHAHAHA!!! BBA (B-boys Basketball Association) NA!!! 4 teams on a quest for the championship. Team ko yung "pinakamaliit" led by Jovic. I know, matangkad si Jovic kaso next "big man" namin si Vincci.....patay na to pag nakalaban namin team nila Carpio (the big team). The bright side about going small is that marami kaming steals (dapat) and mabilis kami (yun sigurado). Anyways, bench lang ako but I like coming from the bench. More on defense naman ako so no need to start right away. Marami din naman kaming scorer sa team so di ko na kailangang gumawa. So.....gotta practice freethrows since mostly slashing ako, most likely magugulpi nanaman ako, hahahahaha!!!

       Paano nangyari yun?!?! Natalo DLSU sa UE?!?!? BAKIT???? Oh well, that goes to show na SHIT does happen. Pati yung 2 idol ko walang masayadong nagawa. And the person to blame is- no, not KG Canaleta, but rather  SEX MASHEEEN  himself!!!  Pula kasi ang favorite color niya eh. Sinipsip niya ang lakas ng mga DLSU players. I don't know how, but I certainly don't want to find out. Basta, sa 2nd round, uupakan ng DLSU lahat ng teams na makakalaban nila. GO LA SALLE!!!!          YOU MAY FALTER NOW, BUT YOU'LL KICK ASS LATER!!!

      Friday today so may basketball nanaman sa hapon. Same smell (Stackhouse!), same moves, same people, same court. But enough about that, let me share what happened sakin nung summer. We went to an orphanage. The kids were cute, makulit, playful and most of all, they  DROOL !!!! It was a Unilab thing (my parents work there). I carried some of them (actually, all of them). And of course, all of them drooled on me. I had to change my shirt after that. We then had lunch in Max's. At least wala nang drooling doon!!!   Do I look good with a kid?

        Kung tatanungin ka, ano ang mas pipiliin mo? Yosi o porno? That is the question that my busmate (di ko na sasabihin pangalan) tried to answer. Ano nga ba ang makukuha mo sa dalawa? Sa yosi, enjoyment kaso early death due to lung cancer. Sa porno, enjoyment kaso prostate cancer naman aabutin mo. hay naku, decisions decisions.... tsk tsk... By the way, why bother ask this bullshit? Kasi may nakita kami sa drawer ng security guard sa Ateneo- yes, sa Ateneo! Mga guard dun, may  PORNO  at  YOSI  sa mga drawer nila sa guard house. Nakita namin tapos the choice was made- "I go for porno". HAHAHAHAHA!!! LABOOOOOOO!!! Of the 3 playboy magazines, (old school editions) 1 lang ang kinuha. Malay ko ba kung ano nangyari sa magazine na iyon. Walang gustong mag-uwi sa amin eh, sino ba ang bobong gagawa nun? Anyways, if u ask me the question for the day- yosi o porno? I would rather pick the porno, yes my friends, porno. I don't smoke and I don't intend to. I'll just try to avoid prostate cancer. hehehe... Well, best of luck if ever maharap kayo sa dreaded decision- YOSI O PORNO?       O di kaya'y

         Who said that turnover prone teams can beat La Salle? ULUL!! Who said that UP can get their first win from DLSU? ULUL!! Yan ang masasabi ko sa inyo, ULUL!! Although medyo foul trouble yung offensive idol ko(Cardona) step-up naman ung hangtime idol ko (Yeo) The speed, elevation and hangtime plus the hook plus the turn around jumper (Casio) plus Cabatu's BLOCK (oh yeah!) gave DLSU a 1 point victory over UP (SUCKERS!). That made my day happy, although my damn tutor had to come and ruin it. Wierd nga eh, napanood mo niyo na ba Austin Powers: Goldmember? Hehe, yung nunal ng tutor ko, parang si Number3. Although not THAT BIG, still the same BIG reaction. HAHAHAHAHA!!! *GUACAMOLE!!!*

       *CELEBRATE*  *CELEBRATE*    In the ADMU-ADu game, Ateneo was lacking in offensive power because star player Larry Fonacier is out for the season (torn leg muscles and stuff... :( poor guy). Ateneo was down by as much as 20 in the 2nd quarter and still had a double-digit disadvantage in the 3rd quarter. I went to mass then thinking that Ateneo will have a 4-1 record when I get back. But then, something REALLY wierd happened, Ateneo won! I called my friend Jason up then he said Ateneo won. I was too surprised to ask by how many but DAMN, how did that happen? (oh ya, I was chattin with Rolf when I was typing this and he said Ateneo won by 3, a 3-pointer by Tenorio in the last 8 seconds). [Ateneo 58, Adamson 55]  I'm glad that Ateneo won but not that glad since DLSU is not doing that well.  Cardona= OFFENSIVE IDOL!!!       Another miracle, although it was pretty stupid, was the FEU-NU game. It was close, which was a surprise because FEU is seen as the stronger team, way stronger. The game goes to overtime, to the delight of Ray Mendoza. In the end of overtime, he misses 2  VERY  important free throws that was supposed to give NU the win because they were tied at 85. After the miss, Don Yabut gets the ball then at the  BUZZER , he was fouled by a rookie from NU (I don't care about the name coz he was  STUPID ) Well, Yabut hits 1 free throw and FEU wins 86-85. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  ARWIND SANTOS=DEFENSIVE IDOL!!!    *CELEBRATE*  *CELEBRATE*
