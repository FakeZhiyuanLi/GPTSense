      Ok, I have no title for this. That's why it says just April 27, 2004. Amazing huh? To cut it short, I just got back on. I did not update the blog on my site yet. That was my purpose, but I decided to stop by anywho.  I've started a new book. It turns out I finished Eragon the next day -Sunday- in the morning. The one I'm reading right now is  This Present Darkness   By:Frank Peretti . It's a relatively old book that was Copyright 1986.  I'm not sure if it's any good yet really. I'm only on page 73. I'll get back with you. I'm falling down trying to get 1 a day, but maybe every other day will work out better. See ya later.

      Ok, this is my second post. I realize that. I just decided that if I couldn't make a jumbled long post, I'd make 2 non-jumbled short posts.  I'm currently reading a book called Eragon. If you've never heard of it, this 497 pages book (509 if you consider the language guide, and author's notes) is about non other than Eragon. Wow! don't know how you guessed. To cut it short, he finds a stone; the stone becomes a dragon hatchling; he and his dragon leave. That's pretty much it. It's a series of 3 and just came out, actually, if you read the back of the book, it came out about 2 years ago, but that's a long story. At least I think I got it right.  I'm on 413 right now, however if I wasn't typing to you to make up lost time, then I'd be closer to the end, and wating for the second book to be published. So, off I go, have fun.

      Ok, so as of yet I have tried to post a little each day. I think the problem really is I'm trying to post too much. So I've created a much smaller story to relate to you people. Then you can ask questions! Wahoo!!  I asked her to the dance. (Her - the girl I like. Yeah, it was posted a while back, I'm not sure if I deleted the post. I went mad. Don't ask, just read below). She said yes if she could. If she could? What the heck does that mean!? Now, as even though I'm feared she's reading this. (AHHHH!) I'm thinking of asking her out there.  That's it. There. I said it. Happy now?

      I've finally worked up enough 'macho' to ask her out. Sure, sounds easy, but now I've been informed that asking her out over the internet is a 'NOT'. Now, after trying to figure out what that meant, I realize 'This is going to be harder than I thought'. Sure, but now, I have to keep myslef from falling over dead if she says no. Or yes for that reason.  Yes, I hae thought about calling her and asking her, but somehow that feels harder than face to face, I'm not sure why. Oh yeah, guess when the Spring Fling (Dance) is: April 30 at 6 Pm. Ok, so now I have a deadline of about 8 days 4 hours. Until I have to tellher I like her and ask her out.  I've thought about asking her out at the dance. And I've wondered if I should do that. It's amazing how many ideas of how you're going to act cool if she says no that come into your head. (Even if I bring my phone I'll be stuck for about 10 minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up. No, that's right, I'm not going for the fun of meeting people. Ok, I am, but that's not the main point here.)  Well, so far I've kept my promise about telling you people what's happening everyday. Let's see if I can keep it up.=-) See ya around. Maybe I'll get to ask her later..... Maybe I'll bend the rules and ask her out over the internet... As for you.... you..you may never know.....Muahahahaha!

      After getting some crazy idea in my head, I decided to start thinking about deleting my post. As of yet, I'm going to delete certain ones I don't want any more. If your thinking this could cause a problem, you're right. I only have a few blog entries to begin with, much less what'll happen if I delete the ones I already have.  I also decided to change the colors and add a picture at the top where my name is. I'm thinking that when I turned 13 on Sunday, something went hay-wire in my brain and now I'm trying to fix everything up. What's really strange is that I've cleaned out my contact list and updated birthdays, addresses, and phone numbers. To top that off I've gone in an downloaded a calender and have put the birthdays in with reminders and everything. I even added when school ends and crap!  I hope this doesn't last long, or else I might be cleaning my room up. And it's already clean as it is. I'm afraid I'll start dusting and never stop. Then you'll see 'Kid starts cleaning spree and hasn't stopped yet' on the New York Times, and I don't even live in New York!  Save me!!!!!!!

       What started out small turns out big.   Also, in  urlLink Part 1  I mentioned I now do PowerPoint for my church. Well, I'm also going to be sooner or later doing their webpage. Because of that, I've chosen to discontinue my webpage ( urlLink www.goatsmilk.tk )and just have the pictures of my cat that it was originally. Only it's not the best in the world.  Well, I gotta go to sleep now. It's getting late. Also, the border around the smilies is still there. I'm still working on it. Well. Bye.

      Sometime ago last week, date forgotten to me, we went up and mowed my great-uncle's yard. There were about 40 or so plants (trees/bushes/flowers/shrubs) in an area that was way too small. The yard itself away from the house was huge. With 3 people working nonstop (me, my sis,my mom) it took 4-5 hours!  Ok, also, don't think I've forgotten  urlLink Einstein's Quiz  because I haven't. The answer is the German. That's right, the German owns the fish. Though it will be a long time before anyone reads this, just post a comment in the newest post I have (that's general- please not a software post, etc) if you'd like to know how I and others got that. It took me about 45 minutes while it took others from 10 all the way to 25. I'll post the answer as I comment as soon as I'm done typing this.  I haven't gotten to talk to my best friend lately. He's been studying as he is in collage. That should explain why he's studying even when school's out. Thank God for that, but we have to go back in just under/over 2 months I wish it was more like 2 YEARS. When it starts back I'll be in 8th grade. I've probably said this a lot, but oh well. I'm crying for ya. Not really, because I don't know who to cry for that reads this.  To Be Continued

       I haven't written in what seems like ages. In fact, going from not missing a day, maybe even multiple posts a day, it is ages.   To go back through and sum everything that's happened in the last few days would be a very long.... very many- posts. So I'll only skim over to top. You're just going to get "the icing on the cake" Maybe even just the icing of the icing on the cake; if there is such a thing.  On Sunday I got to control PowerPoint during the church service, htough the preaching outline didn't work, I did get to do the songs. We also ordered a computer for me today. What started as just a boost in RAM has turned out to be a completly new computer, so once I get it, I can tell you you'll see one of 2 things: I'm going to not post at all until I'm done and give you an overview of what I did each day on it until that day  I'm going to post each day what I've done on my computer  I'm going to send you a premade list before I do it  As much as I'm going to love it, I'm going to have to reinstall every program onto my new hard drive. Then go in and copy what settings and file I find useful over; go back in and copy all pictures, documents, etc.; format the old hard drive; set it up as a "slave/secondary" drive and recopy all my pictures and so forth back over to it.  By the time it's all said and done, I'll have 2 hard drives. A 40GB (new) one that will have all the main stuff, and a 20GB (old) hard drive that will have pictures and other stuff of the likes on it. To Be Continued

      It turns out that -no- Wal-Mart didn't have the 2nd book. It had the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th. Yes, 10th, didn't know there was a 10th. This dude must have no life. So, I got the 3rd, but and not going to read it until I get the 2nd.  I also ran across a program that keeps track of how many click, scrolls, and keys you type. Then it uploads it on the sever. Apparently, it's a contest to see who can get the most.   Tiny KeyCounter is a small, entertaining utility that counts the number of keys you press, how many times you click the mouse, and how many times you use the mouse scroll wheel. All of your statistics are submitted to a centralized server so you can see how you compare to other users from around the world.  If you have no clue about me going to Wal-Mart, then I'm sorry, my post this morning didn't go through. I think the browser crash before it was done. I basically watered flowers and said I was going to get the second book in the series I'm reading.  After you sign up on Tiny Keycounter, go ahead and join a team. I'm " urlLink DriveThroughWindow " in the  urlLink Neowin  team. Maybe you can join and help us out. I'm sure I'll be up there pretty soon if I keep typing though... soo....see ya later.

      There are 5 houses in five different colors. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. These five owners drink a certain drink,smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet no owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar or drink the same drink.  The question is --- who owns the fish?  Hints: - the Brit lives in the red house - the Swede keeps dogs as pets - the Dane drinks tea - the green house is on the left of the white house - the green house owner drinks coffee - the person who smokes Pall Mal rears birds - the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill - the man living in the house right in the center drinks milk - the Norwegian lives in the first house - the man who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats - the man who keeps horses lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill - the owner who smokes Blue Master drinks beer - the German smokes Prince - the Norwegian lives next to the blue house - the man who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks water    *** Einstein wrote this quiz last century. He said that 98% of the World could not figure it out. ***   Think ya know the answer? Just wanna say somebody's smart? Wanna help somebody else find it? Post a comment below.

                  Right now those are the only smilies I have, and I have to copy the full image source, but I'm working on that. Until I can find a quick way to post the picture smilies, I'll have to copy the whole thing, a little more work, but it looks better.I'm also trying to get that border away.....  This is a smiley in-line with text.

        It's now official, Messenger Plus! 3 has finally been released! It took me 5 months to redesign all the software and I can tell you that I'm very happy with the result. As you can see, msgplus.net is also brand new and will continue to be updated during the week. All the sections have been rethought, new feature pages have been added, new merchandise is available for Messenger Plus! 3... soon, the site will even include localized content for the main pages! a new software, a new web site, both of them still as free as ever: what more could you ask? :)  I hope this fourth year will be as great as the past three ones. I promise you that I'll continue to do everything in my power to improve your Messenger experience. Thank you all for your wonderful support!   Wahoo! I've had it since this morning about 5 hours after it came out. I must tell you there's a BIG difference in the appearance of Messenger Plus! now. In the Plus! installation package,  Patchou  included software from his sponsor that installs itself together with Plus! Select  I refuse, do not install the sponsor program  if you don't want anything else but Messenger Plus! on your PC.    The new Messenger Plus can be directly downloaded from  urlLink here , or from the  urlLink downloads  page.    urlLink      Improve your Messenger experience for free at www.msgplus.net

      After spending the whole morning with my internet connection down, I finally turned all the computers off, unplugged the wireless router, and and the cable modem. After pluggin the modem back in, and then the router, the internet worked! Wahoo!!  It wasn't too bad as I spent most of the morning watering flowers and getting to page 588 in my book. If you still don't know what book that is, then you are behind and need to catch up on the news =P  I just want to remind everyone that Msg Plus! 3 comes out tommorow! Don't forget to download it from  urlLink here  when it is released at 8AM GMT. The post can be found  urlLink here , or you can go into the archives and read where I posted what it said.  I will have a direct link when it comes out. Foir those of you in Eastern Standard Time (EST) That'll be 3AM. I may or may not be up at that time to post the link, but as always, it should be easier to just get it from there. You can also choose "About" from the Plus menu in MSN Messenger and then choose "Check for updates"

      To boost up that 27 posts to 28 I decided to post this. This is the "About Me" post. That main thing on my profile. Be sure to check out the rest for more about me, and the rest of my paragraph.    About Me    If you learn anything about me it's that I love to read and I love computers. I love having a blog and exploring new websites. I feel that I read pretty fast and that I have a pretty high IQ for my age, but I'd never post it here because I'm afraid I'd be proven wrong. That might not go over with my ego very well. At the moment I like someone.......  You can check out the rest  urlLink here  =-)Or look at the side ----->

       Nothing much is going on here.   Nothings new today, but I have found a few software updates you might be intrested in. Probably not, but who cares.  I'm on page 411 in my book ( The Eye fo the World ). I still don't know if it's any good, but so far I'm at a good part, so I can't talk long. Also, I probably could have subtitled it TGIF ( T hank  G od  I t's  F riday). Next Tuesday will be the last day for school. We go in and get our report cards and that's it.  I'm still awaiting the day that somebody will look at this and comment, but that's as likely as pigs flying. I have no idea why I post anyway. It seems useless, but the more it seems useless and the more I think about no one ever reading this the more I want to write in it. It's amazing how stubborn I am at times, but I guess that's a good thing

Next year I'll be the one walking across the stage instead of playing music while they march into their seats and then goig off to the side and sitting while about a hundred names are called. Sounds fun huh?  So it's 3:30 now.... that about 2 hours and a half. Now to count them down while I been my latest book  The Eye of the World  by  Robert Jordan . I'll have to tell you about it later. It's a 814 page book, and I'm on page 366. When I'm done I'll tell you how it was. Anyway, that's all I can think about writing. Today wasn't too eventfull.

      After telling you about the release of the new Spybot S&D, I went to  urlLink www.msgplus.net ; knowing that the release was soon. Just guess what I found out:  I am proud to announce that the final public version of Messenger Plus! 3 will be released soon, in only a week from now! The release of Messenger Plus! 3 marks a major milestone in the world of Messenger add-ons and can easily be compared to the revolution brought by Messenger Plus! 2 more than a year ago. The user interface has been completely redesigned, everything looks more professional and appealing than ever before, new features have been added, old features have been improved, all of them are more accessible, more useful, and simpler to use.  Messenger Plus! 3 will be released along with a brand new version of this web site, equivalently improved. The official public release date is  Sunday, May 23rd 2004  at  8:00AM GMT . Prepare yourself for some serious change, MSN Messenger will never be the same!   Taken from the MsgPlus! News and Announcements page found  urlLink here .

         urlLink From Neowin.net   Spybot - Search & Destroy can detect and remove spyware of different kinds from your computer. Spyware is a relatively new kind of threat that common anti-virus applications do not yet cover. If you see new toolbars in your Internet Explorer that you didn't intentionally install, if your browser crashes, or if you browser start page has changed without your knowing, you most probably have spyware. But even if you don't see anything, you may be infected, because more and more spyware is emerging that is silently tracking your surfing behaviour to create a marketing profile of you that will be sold to advertisement companies. Spybot-S&D is free, so there's no harm in trying to see if something snooped into your computer, too.  That's right, the long awaited 1.3 RC5 has come out. Spybot hasn't updated their systems in about 1 1/2 months (The actually program even longer). Long enough for me to lose hope. Thankfully, though release several  days/weeks ago, I ran across this. You can check out the website at  urlLink www.spybot.info . I leave you with a quote from the site:  Those of you who have downloaded Spybot-S&D in the past days will already have seen it - we've now got a public 1.3 version.  In addition to a larger database, speedier scan and many fixed bugs, an important part is named TeaTimer (explanation of that name will follow in the FAQ), which is the new on-access protection part of Spybot-S&D.  A full list of changes will be posted here later on, but is also available in our support forum now.  Thanks to everyone who helped making this new release possible!    Edit- 5:16PM You can download 1.3 RC5  urlLink here .The site doesn't show the RC5.

       Today is a cold, damp, foggy, down-spiriting day. Ok... so it's really only rainy, but I needed an extra sentence. Like this one. And that one   This can go on for ever   And that one    Rain. That sums it up. Besides thinking about starting a blog just for pictures, and besides playing my game and praticing for Graduation (The 20th. 2 days) nothings happened. If you get anything out of my today it'll be a miracle. I might post some news here and there though. You never know.

      Today wasn't that great. If you wanted to know what it felt like, it felt like I was a fool. I didn't talk to Cassie at all even though I really wanted to, and when I finally sat down beside her it was time to go. When I did say "Hi" to her I happened to "squeak" -I guess you'd call it- which didn't make me feel to happy. She laughed at it which I guess she thought it was funny, but I didn't. Yeah sure it's normal, but still, not the happy thing. To say it was funny might be an under statement depending on who you are.  Now, back to today. I don't feel good today, today is going by really slow and having a book that i haven't gotten into yet isn't helping it. If you ever hear a book is bad and boring you know it's true because I'll read almost anything you give me, no matter how long and hard it is. Even if it bores the heck out of me. Back to Cassie, there's this girl that "used" to like me but we still believe that she likes me now. I'd like to say that she actually tries to keep me away from Cassie and keep Cassie away from me.   It seems like everytime I turn around and finally get a chance to talk to Cassie she pops up and tries to talk to me. And she won't move over a seat so Cassie can sit next to me, but she will move over if it's somebody else that's going to sit next to her or me. Not a lot of evidence; no, but it gets on my nerves how she keeps popping up. I think I'm going to kill her if she does it again.   It's not that it's irritating, I mean yeah it is, but it takes everything I've got to calm myself down and finally approach the girl (Cassie) and talk to her. If ya don't think I'm going to be happy when she pops up and distracts me then you are right. (Score one for you!) I am mad. I don't know what I'll do if she does it again. Lik eI said I might kill her. Well, this post is getting long, I might wanna stop now. Maybe I'll right more tommorow.    And pleeeeeaaaaaasee, if you are reading this at least write  something  as a comment. Even if it's just "hi" or "i hope everything works out", maybe even "i'd kill her too", but I've gotten not one single comment at all in this whole blog that hasn't been from  urlLink tBLOG  that I've posted so you'll know what they wrote.

       Nothing much is up here. Maybe you're having more fun than I am. I didn't do much yesterday. I was really quite bored. So bored in fact that I don't even know if I posted yesterday, so if I repeat myself of what I've already said, or mention things you have no clue about- please work with me and ask your questions below.  I'll start out with yesterday since we don't want you to get confused:  Yesterday I'm not sure what happened. More likely I don't know if there was even a yesterday. All I really remember is going out to eat after church and buying a new book called  Eye of the World  by Robert Jordan  . I'm not sure if it's good. Right now I'm thinking it's one of those cheap books that nobody buys and it just sits on the shelf. Considering it has 814 pages and it's a 9 book series, there's no telling if it'll be one of those "....on and on and on and on and on and on....." books.   While we were at Wal-Mart©, we also got one of those $10 games that they have. No, we aren't poor, but there was a "Sherlock Homes" one that looked good called  The Mystery of the Mummy  and I also got  Mysterious Journey , which is roughly the same thing as Myst I, II, and I think there's even a Myst III. I'd have bought it or something better, but I'm saving up my money to fix my computer up and get it up to date. It runs great, but a Gig of RAM and a 64-bit processer as well as a good video card and CD or DVD burner sound pretty good. You have to make some sacrifices.   To give you a quick update, I've gone in and made it so all the links look the same color, even if you've visited the site before, and I took off the underline. When you do put your cursor over a link, it will underline then, just to show you what it is. I thought it looked better that way, but I'm not sure.

      For the past 2 days. May 14th-15th I've been sitting here retaking all the test I have taken on  urlLink Tickle . If you have no clue what it is, it's a site with several hundred test all the way from  urlLink The Classic IQ Test ,  urlLink Tickle's Original Inkblot Test , and ' urlLink The Multiphasic Personality Inventory'  --to the fun test like--  urlLink Which "American Idol" Are You? ,  urlLink Are you Millionaire Material ,  urlLink Are you Evil? ,  urlLink What Type of Flirt Are You? , and  urlLink What Breed of Dog Are You?   For the more serious tests, or  urlLink Premium Tests , Tickle says that: Our PhD certified Premium Tests are based on the most current and accurate research available. Each offers thought-provoking test questions and personalized analyses that will encourage you to go after your goals and improve every relationship you have in your life - with friends, loved ones, even colleagues.  Wheter you believe that or not, it's still a fun place to go if you wnna find out if you have a Six Sense of not. Well, back to taking tests I go. If you want to know what it says about me on any of them, or if you just wanna show off and tell the world, just post your results as a comment. I haven't gotten one yet =-( and I'm still waiting.  *Watches clock*

      I just got back about an hour ago from marching in the Strawberry Festival Parade. Boy was I tired. We were halfway back to the car when my mom called and said that she had told Allyson (my sister) to meet us at the end of the parade route. (She was in it too for being in Junior Miss- I'll tell you more about that when it happens) So we had to wal all the way back to the end.  Right before we left I was thinking about telling ya'll I was leaving (Boy can you tell I'm hick =P), but changed my mind. I did, however, find out that we had a site on it. If you're interested, and don't happen to be one of my friend's that lives here, Here's the  urlLink link .  That's the Tennessee Strawberry Festival for those who are wondering. I know that when I was searching on  urlLink MSN Search  for  urlLink "Strawberry Festival"  it turned up a bit. So did the  urlLink results  from  urlLink Google .

       I've decided to use this one post to post small things through out the day when I'm bored or find something. Each post will be seperated by a horizontal line. Lovely isn't it when you have a day and don't know what to do?     I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. J. R. R. Tolkien (1892 - 1973), The Fellowship of the Ring    Posted: May 14,2004 12:07 PM     I'm still bored an no one's really been on today. Ate a sandwich for lunch. Wow! never had figured I'd be at a loss for words.  Posted: May 14,2004 4:22 PM     I've changed the layout to a blue. Comment if you don't like it. I surveyed the 2 people who were online today and they said the blue. That being said..... Goobye, see ya later. Again.  Posted: May 14,2004 8:50 PM

       Yeah, that's right. No School! Wahoo!   Ok, so it's only no school for just today. That give me a 3 day weekend because of teacher inservice. Too bad for them =-( that means my mom won't be home today. It really is sad. Oh well, she'll be home later on.   I think yesterday was the best day I've spent with Cassie yet. It was field day so we didn't have any classes. Which meant that I got to spend most of the day around her at least and we even got to flirt a little (Yes   we   as in us, both of us) Or I guess you'd consider it flirting. Either way I had a blast. I guess part of the reason was because she didn't take her medication that morning and was hyper, but that's fine by me =-)  On to yesterday after noon, I got to go out and mow that yard since it's supposed to rain on and off today. And guess what happened when I was about to go outside? Cassie got on. Luckily she wasn't going to stay on long anyway so I didn't feel  tooooo  bad. I still wished the whole time that I could be in talking to her even though I probably wouldn't know what to say.  Today I went out side and got to use our weedeater on the bank down near the road. That's always fun because you get your arms shook off. Now I'm going off to help my next-door-nieghbor do hers. It just so happens she's my grandmother =-) Anyway, I might write later but I don't want her to wear herself out. See ya.

      Hey, I just got back about 30 minutes ago from my great aunt's funeral. Though I'd like you people to finally respond for once (if you are out there) it's not too bad realy because I didn't know her.  The one thing I really did care about was my grandmother who was there. I think it really hit her hard when she realized that she was the oldest one left in the family. I hope t turns out alright. For a while we thought she was going to have a stroke at the funeral, but it turned out alright. Her other sister had breast cancer, and we are afraid of what might happen if she dies of it. It showed up again just a little while back.  Anyway, I have another science article to write and I really should be working on it. Might see ya later though. You never know when it comes to me =-)

      At 6 I have to head off for the Academic Banquet. It's not exactly my happiest way of spending the rest of the day, but I guess it's ok.  Unlike other schools, I think, we send everyone with an A average for the whol year. From what I've heard, some schools only send the top 10 or 20 A averages. But of course it's just our schools Acamdemic Banquet and I guess we can do what we want. still hope we don't have to dress up, because I don't really feel like it. I don't think I will anyway.  On other news, Patchou has annouced that the release of  urlLink MsgPlus! 3  will be on the week of May 16th. This was annouced yesterday at what it says 3:19 AM. Who knows what time zone, but that's nt what matters. If you haven't heard of MsgPlus! (Messenger Plus!) then you might wanna check out the site. It's for MSN Messenger. It has a lot of features, but I hear the new release is even better. I guess we will all have to wait. Here's a quote from the site.     Originally posted by Patchou  Hello everyone,  in case you would be a beta tester, a translator or someone else who wants to talk to me, you should know that I'll be gone (to Los Angeles, check out other threads) until thursday. I would have liked to give the final release date of Plus!3 before I go but that's unfortunately impossible right now. However, I can affirm one thing: the release will be made during the week of the 16th, so you don't have much more to wait :).  Thank you for your support everyone! if I'm taking these 3 days of vacations, it's thanks to you .  Patchou     Of course the whole thread can be found  urlLink here. Well, that's all. Wish me luck. Maybe I'll hae some fun. On a side note: I can't wait until MsgPlus!3 comes out!

      Hey people.... if you didn't notice sooner, everything has been added to Blogger. Thanks to the ability to change the date it was posted,I added everything and it looks like nothing was ever different. The only way you know is because of this. Heck, I could have left you hanging like nothing ever happened =P  Anyway, you need to remember that anything past ' urlLink New Member/ 2nd Post ' is going to be from the other Blog. My old one. Anyway, that's it about my blog, but be sure to refresh it in a sec cause I'm about to post again about today.

      I figured that the last post deserved a post unto itself. If I had thought about it sooner I would have posted that I was new ,and blah blah blah..., before that post. I could go through and delete it, but I've changed my mind real quick like and decided to just post this now.  I've heard about how good  urlLink Blogger  was, but I never actually got into blogs until a month ago. Blogger wasn't reintroduced to me until today. Before that I'd been using  urlLink tBLOG  and I still don't know which one to go with. I love the templates on Blogger that they offer, but there is that ad at the top. And does it have all the same cool stuff?  Anyway, I heard about the new design on Blogger and decided to check it out. Now I'm thinking that the ad at the top really might not be too bad. I mean, it is free and I get all these cool things. Where as with tBLOG I'd have to pay to get templates, and the pre-made ones aren't (of course) as good as these. I doubt I'm very good at making templates anywhoo.  Well, I think I've pretty much typed enough for today. If you want to see all my old posts on my tBLOG account,  urlLink go here . I might just copy them all over tommorow so I can catch all you people up on everything that's happened. Anyway, toodles, and have a great day.

      If you haven't noticed I'm happy. At the end of the day today I was called into the office to receive a $50 bill. I was drawn out off the people who have had all A's every 6-week period. (Or 3 A's 2 B's, but in my case it was all A's  )  That's pretty much all I have to say right now. Didn't do much yesterday. I was mostly bored. We did was the car though so now everythings nice and clean. I also got a new MSN Messenger skin off of  urlLink Mess.be , but that's pretty much it.   PS- I've entered it on  urlLink  Where's George   ( urlLink Click here to see the page ) and I've also updated  urlLink My Profile . See ya around =-)

      Ok, so this isn't going to be a page long, but I have sound now. I have now clue what happened to begin with, but for the last 1-2 weeks I have had no sound on my computer, even with a pair of new speakers.  To add to that note, I've come across and old site I used to go to. I hope everyone will check it out. If you've been there a while back, please check it out again. It has a new layout. Anyway:  urlLink Where's George  Oh yeah, if you're from Canada, don't forget to check out  urlLink Where's Willy

      No, I'm not actually burning up. It's my newest book I'm reading. I finished   This Present Darkness  yesterday. I had a great time at the dance, but to the disapointment of everybody (except maybe Cassie- do you think I ask her if she was sad I didn't ask?) I didn't ask her out.  I spent a lot of yesterday doing a ton of stuff. Got to haul 5 gallon buckets of water up and down a hill over and over for plants; even though it was going to rain. Then we went to the store for a while. I got some new shoes (as if I don't have enough, but I guess I have grown out of most of the ones I have) while I was there.  I also got to finihs up on the announcements at church, which was Oh-so-fun. I have to do them every week. Kinda stinks, but it's ok. I also get to do the church webpage, but as of yet I haven't gotten to do that because I haven't started. That now makes a blog, a church webpage, and my webpage that I have to keep up with. Oh the joy.  I'm working on my webpage right now. I'm working on getting my menu up. Right now it doesn't have anything on it, and the colors would clash with the colors on my site. But that doesn't bother me much that it's not up, because there's nothing to link to but the blog. I plan to change that pretty soon. Most of the link will point away from my site, but that doesn't matter because I wouldn't want to bore you people out.  Speaking of which, I think I'm going to leave now. I might come back later on tonight, considering it's only 1:39 PM now. I'm still trying to get on every other day, but so far it hasn't happened.  PS- I'm on page 55. and the book  Burning Up  was written by  Caroline B. Cooney .

      Today was pretty much uneventful. I went and mowed my Great-Uncle's yard, but that' pretty much was all.  Amazingly, I'm not done with the Prologue in "Lord of Chaos" Normally I'd be irritated by that, but since I mowed for most of the day, and since the Prologue's 72 pages, I don't find it too odd.  I better be done with it by tomorrow though. Well.. enough of this. See ya, bye.

       I had intended and getting home and making separte posts for yesterday and tomorrow, but I however turned up lazy =-)   Yesterday we were shopping all day and when we got back I didn't have a chance to post. I almost thought I wouldn't get a chance to post today, but I was proven wrong. We thought we might go to the movies, but it turn out to late after we had finished everything  and  gone to Lowe's.  Today we went to see  Beauty & the Beast  The Playhouse is the first theater in the world licensed by Disney to produce Beauty and the Beast independently. It is one of the most lavish productions in Playhouse history, and advance ticket sales are ahead of last year's hit Cats.   You can check out thier website at  urlLink www.ccplayhouse.com . We just got back like I said.  I finished reading  The Fires of Heaven  on the way back home. I haven't gotten a chance to start in on the 6th book ( Lord of Chaos ), but I intend to finish it after I finish this and write an e-mail to Cassie. Anyway, I won't take up and more of your time, if you won't take up anymore of mine. Talk to you later. Bye.

      It seems like everytime I turn around and I need someone to talk to, all my friends have run away. I also think they know when I'm going to need them to talk to or whatnot because it seems to me that everytime I turn around and it turns out this way, they've been long gone for about a week, and then another week after I don't need them.  If you've ever had this happen to you, then I'm glad. Not that you've had it happen mind you, but that I'm not alone. I'd never want anything to happen to you (Unless you decided to never come back. Then you can die a slow and painful death. Muahahahaha!!!) *Clears Throught* Anyway, I really don't have much to write tonight. I'm halfway trhough with  The Fires of Heaven  Then I start on the 6th book in  The Wheel of Time  series. I still don't have the 8th one, but that's a long ways off. So you hope =-)  So off I go now. Bye. I really should tell you about today though. We were gone shopping the whole day. That's usually what ends up happening when my sis goes to the allergist and gets her shots.And oh well... Blah Blah Blah. I'm tired. Bye. =-P

      After a quick review of thought, I've decided not to move the smiley pictures over onto another server. So later on after so long, all of them will be deleted and never seen again. The reasons were simple enough, that I doubt many people will go back that far into the history and read  everything . I think I will just at a "pictures removed by author" image in the smilies place. And for all the others just delete the link to them.   Other image have been moved to a permant sever so that even if the pages don't get a hit in so long, it won't be deleted. This will save me trouble for going back through those pages. This new one does have a bandwith limit, but, I shouldn't have a problem with that because not many people come anyway. Or at least I doubt it. Those will be stuck on that server until I decided to pay for a website domain name at which time I will run everything off of there; images and the blog. One of the many wonderful things you can do with Blogger =-); upload your blog via ftp to a domain. Wahoo!  But that's a long way coming. Well, I'll post more later. Bye

I just now got my internet back up and running from where I had to format and reinstall my computer after I screwed it up *blush* Anyway, I've gotten almost everything back on it, though I'll have to fix setting back on it, but that shouldn't take to long.  I went to my Nana and Papaw's home today; in what we call the middle of nowhere- where I got all the addresses off of their old computer to the new one. An easy task. Give me no praise.

      For those of you who wanted more than 512 digits of Pi, You might want to check out  urlLink http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~huberty/math5337/groupe/digits.html  if it is still up. There was also one page where you could download a text file, but I'll try to re-find it tomorrow.   PS- I tried to find a club for people who didn't understand anything about  Pi , but the best I got was a webpage for people who couldn't remember 2 digits of  Pi  =-P Unfortunate for you, he quite updating the list long ago because "it felt more like a chore than fun" Off to bed I go now.

       Don't ask. Just listen =-) I had to post something.   Below are the first 512 digits of Pi.  Pi is a name given to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter. That means, for any circle, you can divide the circumference (the distance around the circle) by the diameter and always get exactly the same number. It doesn't matter how big or small the circle is, Pi remains the same. Pi is often written using the symbol  and is pronounced "pie", just like the dessert.   Because Pi is known to be an irrational number it means that the digits never end or repeat in any known way. But calculating the digits of Pi has proven to be an fascination for mathematicians throughout history. Some spent their lives calculating the digits of Pi, but until computers, less than 1,000 digits had been calculated. In 1949, a computer calculated 2,000 digits and the race was on. Millions of digits have been calculated, with the record held (as of September 1999) by a supercomputer at the University of Tokyo that calculated 206,158,430,000 digits. (first 1,000 digits)      Pi   3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105 82097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706798214 80865132823066470938446095505822317253594081284811174 50284102701938521105559644622948954930381964428810975 66593344612847564823378678316527120190914564856692346 03486104543266482133936072602491412737245870066063155 88174881520920962829254091715364367892590360011330530 54882046652138414695194151160943305727036575959195309 21861173819326117931051185480744623799627495673518857 527248912279381830119491298336733624    If you don't understand any word of this, then join the millions of people who don't (or I like to think who don't) I really did have much to say today, so instead I decided to post on  Pi . I got this calculation using the  Power Calculator   urlLink here .You can find lists with thousands of digits on the net- Just search in  urlLink Google . This isn't even icing on a cake. =-)

      I finally finished the computer table I've been working on for the past 2-3 days. With a little help lifting the cabinet upper-part on top of the actual tap; screwing it in - it's finished. It's really great. We got a big chair with it too, though I don't like it too awful much. That's fine with me, it's not mine anyway =-)  My sister also got to go to her first job for the first day! We've been trying to get her to go to work for a long time. After her friend suggested her for the job, she got a call the other day. We knew she had one that day straight after she came back, but her friend was going on vacation to Mexico from now until someday. (I think)  Anyway,I have to go eat. It's 9 and I should have eaten later. So..... bye, see ya later. I'll have to do a better job of keeping up on posting in here.

      It's been a really long time since I've actually written about  me.  It's a whole 'nother story about how long it's be since I've written about new programs and junk. If you've noticed, I'd say at least 10 posts are all about programs and not about me. We're going to try and sum this in one  small  post instead of 3 long post like the last time. (A Big Leap- Part 2; Part 3)  Today I mowed my great-uncle's yard; again. Wow! you know what? I've just forgotten everything I was going to write about, so instead of try to find out what I was going to say, I'm just gonna leave. I'm to tired to think right now. Anyway, I'll see ya.

      I've got the 3rd book in  The Wheel of Time  in my hand. Actually in front of me. I just finished the 2nd about five minutes ago ( The Great Hunt ) So far it's a really good series, but long and drawn out. Having ten books in it is more than enough.  I've also learn that at the beginning of each book, after the Prologue, it starts out all the same:  The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was  a  beginning.  Well, I'm off to start reading it. I've just read the prologue and then I decided to write these 2 blog posts. Anyway, I leave you with a list of all the book in order:    The Eye of The World  The Great Hunt  The Dragon Reborn  The Shadow Rising  The Fires of Heaven  Lord of Chaos  A Crown of Swords  The Path of Daggers  Winter's Heart  Crossroads of Twilight

      After a problem with the Blogger server, or my computer, I have deleted the may posts and reposts of " urlLink A While Back ". It did not show it had sent the post through, and thus was created about 7 times. That has been resolved.   (Note: Because of this, the link has extra #s at the end of it, telling which post of a while back. Sorry about this. Accessing http://abc-123.blogspot.com/2004/06/while-back.html won't get you anywhere. You should type direct links like that anyway.

      A while back I posted a quiz that was - suppossedly - made by Einstein himself. However, after going back trhough all my post I had made at Neowin.net, I ran across this explaination. The answer as we all thought was in fact not the fish. In fact, the fish wasn't an answer at all. Check it out. I'm not sure where they got it or I'd post. The Real Solution to the Einstein Quiz Are you sure you want to read the real answer? Maybe you want to think about it some more? Once you read the answer, you can't go back!  Solution to the Einstein Quiz: The Fifth Pet All the answers to the Einstein Quiz I have seen on the web go through the same mechanical process to solving the puzzle. They chart out the problem, lay out each clue graphically, and slowly build a picture of which persons, drinks and pets are in which houses. Its a logical, technical and involved process. If you do all this (here is an example), you find out that it is the German who has fish.  But is this the right way to solve the problem? No its not! Nowhere in the problem, except in the question, is the word fish found. Thus the fifth pet might just as well be elephants as fish. After a lot of work you can safely conclude that the German has the fifth pet, but you have to ASSUME that the fifth pet is fish in order to conclude the German has fish. But you have no basis for making this assumption. Note that Einstein was very careful to separate the "Facts" from the "Question" in this puzzle.  So the correct answer to the Einstein Quiz is: You have no idea if anyone keeps fish or not! Once you grasp the nature of the problem correctly, its rather simple to solve, isn't it? And it is just like Einstein to give us a puzzle like this, for he stressed examining assumptions, and once wrote: "The important thing is to not stop questioning."  The original blog post can be found  urlLink here . The old answer post has been deleted by me. Sorry if I threw some of you off.

      I've also run across a new picture server. I'm not going to go back and change the server on the smilies  yet , but I will later on. It loads a lot faster, but I don't get a username to delete everything. If ya wanna check it out, surf on over to  urlLink http://pics.xs.to/ . Have fun. It was the top rated of the ones I found, and it offer a wide variety of pics you can upload. Ok, so that was a joke. You can only upload .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .png  Anyway, see ya later.

      My new computer came in yesterday. I love it. The only thing is I'm having to reinstall everything. I could make an image of my old hard drive and copy it to the new one, but I'd rather reinstall everything and just copy over what's needed. I think that would be better.  It's nice and black with silver on the fron't. I got a black keyboard and new speakers that came along with it. The keyboard doesn't really make a sound which is good it you aren't supposed to be on it =P. The speakers put out wonderful sound. I don't think I'll ever go back to my old ones. My old ones were white anyway, so with everything black but the monitor and mouse, why get white speakers?  The specs aren't that great but it's better than I had and I'm not complaining. Her they are:  2.60 GHz 40GB Hard drive 256MB of RAM CD-RW Drive (48x Max. Write speed)  That's basically it. I hope to have 2 hard drives soon. My formatted old one, and then the new one I have now.

      My latest book I'm reading is  The Amber Spyglass . It's the 3rd book in the series   urlLink His Dark Materials  . I meant to tell you about it last night, but it's better telling you now.  It came in a series of 3. The 1st-   urlLink The Golden Compass  ; The 2nd-   urlLink The Subtle Knife   ;and then the 3rd-   urlLink The Amber Spy Glass  . All 3 books of course are written by Philip Pullman. So far it's a really good series, but I've yet to find a book quite like   urlLink The Mark of the Horselord  . I think that's the best book I've ever read.   Those are links to the Amazon.com page for each book. If the link is not working, you can search for them there.

      I went camping with my Church youth group last night out at Skymont. It was fun, but I got about 30 (seriously, I can post a pic) bug bites on both of my legs. Not very comfortable when at least one is itching all the time.  Tomorrow happens to be the *big* day that I change the layout. I've somewhat decided with what everyone has said. Anyway, I'm about to update the template scource on my computer in case anything happens. It's still the old one with book 8 showing, but that's not much of a big change.  I can't promise when it'll change, but the template isn't the important part of all this. It's the blog. =-) But you can't live without all the nifty little addons and gadgets in life now can you?

      I just finished  A Crown of Swords . No more of that. The next is  A Path of Daggers.  I'll update it once again when I can find I picture soon enough. The  last  chatper (ironically called  A Crown of Swords ) give way to how the book got it's name. Basically, the crown of Illian ( a city in the book) has little swords on it. On the cover of the next book it's the thing on top of Rand's head.  Anyway, I think I have to go to this camp thing in a second, so I'll go ahead and be getting ready. Guess I won't get to start on my book as soon as I thought.

       Yesterday was my sis's B-day. We mostly all got her clothes, but my mom and dad bought her a genuine ruby cross neckalce she could wear. Personally, her being 17 and losing stuff all the time, I wouldn't have given her it yet, but then again I'm not them.  I'm almost done with  A Crown of Swords . I'm on page 797 or 855, so there isn't much left until The Path of Daggers. I really haven't figured out what's with the title yet and why it's called that. I wish I did, but I guess I'll find out by the time I'm done. Maybe I'll be nice and tell you then....  On a side note: Only 1 more day until the template change. (As if it's really that big!). I've had this once since the beginning of the blog and now it's gonna get changed. I still haven't decided which one to go with, but I will soon enough, don't worry about that. I'm going more for the one of the right (# 565), but it might not be either of those by the time I'm done.

      Ok, I'm not done with  A Crown of Swords  yet, but I noticed while I was going back through July (to find out when I had finished my books) that I had said the books name was "A Crown of  Thorns ". However, I must have been thinking about Church at the time because that was not correct. Everywhere else it says  A Crown of Swords , except for that post. The problem is now fixed, and let's hope it doesn't happen again.   I'm on page 645 for those of you wanting to know, and I hope to finish it by about Thursday or Friday. Now back to reading =-D

      This morning, my mother sent me to dusting. DUSTING. Can you believe it? I mean, who in their right mind would dust their room? Keeping it clean is ok I guess, but DUSTING???!!! Anyway, I've taken a break while my mom left to take my sister to soccer practice. I mean, there's only so must work you can take at a time.   It's almost August. You know what that means. New desktop. New layout. Hopefully a new book. School *puck*. Fall. New Blogs. A lot of other stuff. My grandmother's B-day, and so on.  Speaking of which, my sister's B-day is on the 29th. Just 2 days away. Hope she wasn't expecting a cake, because as far as I know we don't have one. Ah. Oh well. She doesn't deserve one. (Ok she does, but just incase she's reading my blog..... work with me here)   Anyway, we all bought her clothes. I paid for some my mom picked out. Noooo.... it's gotta be clothes. She wouldn't let me buy anything else. Geezes. She'll be 17. Almost off to collag so I can have her room. Wahoo! Well.... see ya.

      I went fishing on my grandfather's (father's side) farm today. I took my friend Avery with me. We only caught 2 fish in all. He caught one, and my dad caught one. I didn't catch any. Last time, when it was just me and my dad, I caught 6 and my dad caught 1.  We think the reason is that my g-dad feeds them in the evening and that's when we fished last time. We think it was too early when we went today. Anyway, we gave Avery both the fish to take home. Nothing for me but a blog story, but that's ok. =-)

      I just noticed I had a comment from a few days ago. I hope that there haven't been others that I have missed, but I'm afraid there might have been. If you have commented and I haven't responded I'm sorry, but now I've set it to where Blogger will e-mail me whenever I get one.   That should clear some stuff up for those of you who might have or will. Sorry about that. I'll go back through in a few minutes and see if there's any more I've forgotten. =-$    Edit:  I went through and didn't find many comments. Not sure if that's good or bad. =-P&nbsp;To "Mac", thanks for commenting on June the 1st&nbsp;(I think). To my lovely (or not so lovely =-P) Anonymous friend(s), glad you commented too.

      I got my new galsses this morning. I really like them, but they are making me a little bit dizzy. The doctor said that was because I had gone up a bit in the perscription. When we got done there, we also went shopping for shoes and I got some news ones. My foot had grown and all my other ones are small.  That's pretty mcuh all I have to say. I'll see if I can find something else to write. See ya. Bye

      I've been really bored lately. Not much going on, so I haven't had anything to write for a few days. I went to the eye doctor the other day and I'm going to get new glasses. Unlike the last time, it only took 10 minutes to pick out the frames.   As I said, not much going on. I don't have anything really to tell you except that the part holding my ceiling fan up had broken and my fan was only being held up by a piece of metal, but I saw it in time. No worries. Well. That's all. I'm still thinking about which of the templates I should choose. I've decided to choose bye August because that's when school starts (or did I already say that)   Well. See ya. I'll tell you when I get my new lenses and frames.

      I'm thinking about updating the blog design before I go back to school. I think it might look a little better since the blue is getting a little boring. Right now I have it set to  TicTac (Blueberry).  There's also a TicTac which is the same thing only green instead.  &nbsp;  I'm now sure what I'm going to change it to yet, but I'd like it too be a little different. I'm thinking about the ones below right now, but I'm far from sure.     urlLink       urlLink    urlLink &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      We got back from the eye doctor about 1-2 hours ago. I'm glad I'm getting new glasses because my old ones were so scratched up that I saw "rays" -lines-&nbsp;coming out of lights when I looked at them.  &nbsp;  We decided to get new frames  and  lenses. The ones we got this time fit better and took 1/6 of the time it took to pick out my old ones. These are rimless too. I still can't wait until I get contacts though.

      In case years from now the Shrek and Shrek 2 sites go offline (most likely after so long they will), I've uploading the intro from both movies onto my website. If you ever find that they no longer work (no matter how long down the road), please e-mail me so I can re-upload them and change the links.  &nbsp;  I like to make sure people have access to everything I've pointed and linked to even if it's 30 years from now. Once I get $$$ and get a paid host I'll move my blog and  everything  over to it. That way I won't have to depend on free sites that have bandwith limits and I won't have to worry about having pictures and stuff on some site that may go down.  &nbsp;  Anyway, here are the links. Please don't use these unless the actual site work. I'm not even sure I can do this legally. =-)  &nbsp;  urlLink Shrek   urlLink Shrek2  &nbsp; As a note, the intos link back to themselves in a never ending loop. So clicking skip intro won't work. lol.

      I was too tired last night too type this up. Actually, I would have, but my mother made me go on to bed =-P. We went to see  urlLink Shrek 2 &nbsp;last night. It was better really than the 1st (You guessed it  urlLink Shrek ).  &nbsp;  After we got done. We stopped by Wal-Mart to pick up cat food. Cat food. One thing. We left with cat food, a car seat cover (2 really), new fishing line, fishing hooks, a fillet knife,  and  the next 3 books in    The Wheel of Time  series. It took me a bit to find the 8th book. I decided to go ahead and get the 9th and 10th. I kept looking even though I had already looked and happened to find it behind a book the wasn't were it was supposed to be anyway.  &nbsp;  So, once I get done with the 7th (I'm on page 287 out of 855), I'll start in on the 8th book; The Path of Daggers.

      Ok, so since I forgot to write my 3rd post last night, I decided to come and tell you now. The only problem is that I've forgotten what I was going to say *blush*. Anyway, don't think I had forgotten.  &nbsp;  On a side note, the book at the side has been updated. If any of the link happen to go to the wrong place, please tell me so I can fix that. Another thing, if the page is disorted in anyway (it shouldn't be) tell me that too. Nothing brought that up, but I decided to make a note of it.  &nbsp;  On to more detail, I'm going to go through the old post about Msg Plus and upload the image on to Blogger instead of my own host. You didn't have to know that, but I just decided to post it anyway =-P   Oh, and as another side note, updates on the site take much longer time than before. The reason for this is it has to go through and update every page, so please be aware that when I am updating the template (say the book) on every page, it may not show up correctly for a minute or more.

      A new/current update that Blogger has gone through makes it a whole lot easier to type and make post. Instead of having to learn and use HTML ( H ypertext  M ark  U p  L anguage), you can now use a word processor like format to add to your blog! This makes it a lot easier,  but,  my&nbsp; urlLink Firefox  browser causes the format to change and it freezes up and closes everytime I post.  &nbsp;  This&nbsp;isn't much of a problem when I use&nbsp; urlLink Internet Explorer , so I'll start using it to post. Don't worry, it doesn't change anything, and maybe they'll get it to working sooner or later. Anyway, I have to go outside for a sec, then I'll make a 3rd and maybe final post before updating my current book.

      I just finished my lasted book  Lord of Chaos  by  Robert Jordan  a few seconds ago. The next book- the 7th- is  A Crown of Swords ; thus, the title. I'll be updating my current book "section" at the side --> in a few minutes once I get done typing up this post and the next.   The last one had me on my feet and I couldn't put it down for the last hour because of everything that was happening. I must confess that reading 10 books is getting irritating just a bit. A very little bit but a bit none-the-less. Next time we go to  urlLink Wal-Mart    I've got to pick up the 8th, 9th, and 10th ones. Last time I checked though they didn't have the 8th so I'll probably have to buy it at  urlLink Books-A-Million.  I took to buying 3 books at a time up until this very last here I bought only 2 since the 7th wasn't there.   Well, enough of that. Onto my next post =-)

      I thought you might want to know why I might not be here Monday- Wednesday.  The camp, ROBOTECH 2004, will allow participants to work in small teams to design, build, program and test their own autonomous robots using the LEGO Mindstorms Robotics Invention System. For students entering grades 5-8, the program is designed to build interest in engineering, science, technology and math, said camp director Ken Hunter.  Campers will have the opportunity to work with Tennessee Tech engineering professors as they learn about robot mechanics, robot sensors and programming. Tennessee Tech engineering students will serve as camp counselors. This summer’s challenge will feature robots cleaning up a hazardous chemical spill. The robots will activate an alarm system, retrieve a chemical sample, deliver cleanup supplies and move chemical drums.  Campers will demonstrate their robots during a friendly competition on the final day of camp. Parents will be invited to attend the competition and awards ceremony. The fee for campers who stay overnight is $295, which includes all program materials, room and meals for three days, snacks, a camp T-shirt, camp photo and certificate. For day-campers, the fee is $245.  The full article can be found  urlLink here .

      I'm almost done with my book. I'm on page 824. The only problem I'm finding is they are getting a little boring. It kinda is all the same and switching from one place to the next gets irritating. It's usually at a good part too. He did a little better in this book. Instead of having like 4 long chapters then a switch it's more 2 short ones. That makes it easier and keeps your attention.  Several reviews I read said that you should skip all but the main parts about Rand, but I find that the story centers around everyone else just as well as him, but maybe that's just me. Anyway, I also could be getting "burned out" on it, but oh well. Talk 2 ya later. Bye. (Again)

      I was too tired yesterday when I got home from my grandparents (father's side) to even post. I decided I'd better post today though, since I'm probably not going to get to post Monday, Tuesday,  or Wednesday. In fact, I almost think I'm a little too tired now.  Yesterday me and my dad went over to his parents farm; what we consider the middle of nowhere. About the middle of the day we went fishing. As it turned out I caught 6 catfish and my dad caught only 1 =-) (Yes, that's the truth).  He probably would have caught more, and me included, but it started to rain on us. So.... we had to go in.   All in all we had pretty much more than enough, but it would have been better to have more than 2 days worth of fish. And that's saying we gave some to my grandparents. Today however was pretty (is pretty) much normal. Not much goes on on Sundays to talk about, but I guess then again not much goes on during the summer when you are around me. I am a pretty boring person. Well. Off I go. Later.

      Hey, I've just registered on  urlLink DeviantART  for the first time as  urlLink DreamStyle . If you wanna have a look through my favorite pictures, just go straight to  urlLink this  link.  I had taken to being a little strick on my favorite pictures/icons/etc, but I decided not to and to just get basically everything I liked favorited. So, if you want to know what kind of stuff I like, just go through and check it out. I haven't gotten to go through all the catogories, so I might never get to some since it's so large a site. I'm not currently subscriped, but that doesn't matter. I might start posted some of my digital camera pics on there.  Anyway, that's all. Back to reading my book and working on the church site ( urlLink www.firstbaptistdayton.org )

      This morning was pretty much boring. From 8 until about 12/1 O'clock we picked blueberries at some farm. It wasn't a really long drive, but it was the picking that was boring. If you don't know, picking berries is the thing I probably hate most. I find that after about a gallon (or less) my mind starts wandering and I start to get impatient.  Considering my mother and grandmother want us to pick about 12 gallons of berries, it makes me even more impatient. *shudders* Which, by the way, we picked 12 gallons this morning, and all the little bug bites on my and them bagging them up to be frozen in the kitchen right now, if proof enough.  On to another topic, I can't believe it is 7:30 already. I guess I expected time to hold still while we picked berries this morning but I'm wondering if it's a good thing it didn't. There's another day lost without reading my book. I'm on page 610 which happens to be a new chapter I haven't read yet. I might read it after I get done here, but I don't know. Anyway, off I go. Bye. Good luck!

      After a little expedition this morning, I've changed over to  urlLink WhatPulse  from  urlLink Tiny KeyCounter . The whole purpose was because most of the people on  urlLink Neowin.net  were using it in a team and not Tiny KeyCounter. So, leaving my 330K key count behind, I start over again with a new program. All the more reason to try and type as much as I can. A few days from now I'll forget it, but then I'll pick it back up again when I notice the picture in my post. For my current count, you can look to the picture below, which should update every time I "Pulse".  Anyway, I'll leave you alone now. I still should be folding towels, but decided to post this little peice of imformation before I left. See ya!   urlLink     Note: My username is  NeoTech , though it isn't shown above so I could make it smaller.

      We went to look at a collage yesterday for my sister. That's about it. Today we've just been working around inside. I went out and mowed, but nothing big.Today I did install several peices of software, and aranged my icons and desktop a little, but the basics are the same.  Anyway, I'll be going right now. Like I said before; that's about it. I might get on and post the software later, but only if I don't feel too lazy. =-P See ya. Bye. Back to folding towels.

      Yesterday I posted my July desktop with picture, and a link to the visual style Royale. Royale is an official Microsoft theme taken from Windows Xp Media Center Edition 2005 Build 2149. It is in fact the first theme after XP Betas in about 3 years. This theme comes with the new Media Center Edition beta, and will probably come with the actual release.   urlLink      I posted this so that everyone would know what I was talking about when the link on the site happens to go down. It might clear stuff up when people want to know what theme that is in my desktop if someone goes back one year and looks through it.   One thing you might want to note, is that this is an officail theme and will not need any .dll patches to run. If by chance you did not want to become a member of Flexbeta but want it, check out this link-  urlLink here .

      We just got a new Featherlite weedeater (found  urlLink here) . Our old one broke. It seems everything is breaking. Just yesterday we had to buy a new vacuum. Our old one wouldn't pick up any dirt at all =- Anyway, the vacuum was the  urlLink Eureka Boss SmartVac Model# 4870. . I would like to say it is the best vacuum out there, but our old one was so sucky (or not sucky =-P) That I wouldn't know. If I remember correctly it was rated #1 by  urlLink Consumer Reports , but I am not sure. Anyway, I also cut my knee, but that was after I vacuumed. Everything is ok now, even though it still hurts. =-) Talk to ya later.

      Yesterday I was too tired to write once I got home. What it realy amounts to is I didn't want to write an entry, but I was so bored this morning I decided I would =-)  The phrase "We went to the dentist" sums it up as quick as I can. There really isn't much more to it. I still haven't gotten too far in  Lord   of   Chaos . I'm only on page 261 out of 986. So I've still got a ways to go. Anyway, I'll be seeing ya. Bye.

      We finally got the fan put up. Now I can type in light instead of in the darkness. Dad says it shouldn't break this time so I'm hoping on that. Wasn't pleasent sitting in the dark up until 11-12.  The finishing touches are being put in my room. Not much more left to do. Glad for that because school starts Monday. I have a lot more room so it seems, and the bed it pointing a different way. Anyway, not much more to talk about. That's pretty much all I've done straight through the whole day. Anyway, back to talking to people. See ya!

      We went shopping for some new jeans. My old ones could be considered 'highwaters' I had grown so much since I had first originally gotten them. We got back a little late to pick up my sister from work. She had to stay 47 minutes late after she had gotten out.  Anyway, not much is going on. Only Robin is on right now, but she's cleaning her room like I should be.   Note: Robin lives in Kansas and is too old for me anyway ;-) don't suggest her a a g/f.

      We rearranged my room today. Recently my mother got me a bookshelf and I decided that with it in the room I didn't like the layout. The bed is cast-iron so it was awful to move, but I like where it is a whole lot better. Computer and drawers were about the only thing that stayed in the same place, but she painted the drawers too so it would brighten up the room a bit.  I haven't gotten to read any in my book today or much of yesterday because of that, but I am on page 265. Once I'm done with this there are only 2 more books in the series. School starts Monday so I'm trying to get my room straightened up and trying to get the books done before school too.  Anyway.... enough about school. Off I go.
