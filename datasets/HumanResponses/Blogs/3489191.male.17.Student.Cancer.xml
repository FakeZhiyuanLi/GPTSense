       Song: Lemon Demon - Consumer Whore Mood: Bothered   This is gonna be the second-to-last post I make.  I've decided to shut this blog down.  But I am pleased to announce the up-and-coming Flaming Chicken Studios, a project that my friend and I have been working on for quite some time.  Details of this project are sketchy right now, but we expect to have a webcomic, a few Flash videos, and a bunch of other goodies.  Until then, goodbye.   Random Quote:  "I pose a conundrum to ya.  A riddle, if you will.  What's the difference between you and a mallard with a cold?  One's a sick duck... I can't remember how it ends, but your mother's a whore." -Sean Connery (Actually, Darrell Hammond playing Sean Connery, but the effect is the same.)

       Song: Bloodhound Gang - I Hope You Die Mood:  Tired    I'd like to take a moment to give props to my friend _-Kakashi, who, with his sagely words of advice, helped me get to where I needed to go.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to the event that I was looking forward to, but hey, I'm ever so closer.   I've decided to half-ass about the review of The Day After Tomorrow.   In short, it's a protest against global warming and the burning of fossil fuels with a dramatic story thrown in to underlie the movie's true nature.  And in other news, expect an actual review of Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban sometime next week.  I've already got most of it written, and will finish it up after I see the movie again next weekend.   Random Quote:  "I haven't slept for ten days, because that'd be way too long." -Mitch Hedburg

       Song: L'Arc~en~Ciel, Ready Steady Go Mood: Hungry   Gonna see the new Harry Potter movie this Friday.  The concept of Alan Rickman as Snape has delighted me to no end, as did his role of the Voice Of God in Dogma.  I'd love to see what it'd be like if Sean Connery played Dumbledore, though.  And I also thank the powers that be every night that my friend Kaitlin isn't the director. Although I really have nothing against yaoi, it is not my cup of tea.  Anyway, I've lost my train of thought, so enough about that.      I've decided to delay my review of The Day After Tomorrow, it should be up before Monday, though, so be sure to check it out.  Also, I've decided to imitate a friend of mine and list my current mood and what song I'm listening to at the time of each post.    And I've decided to get rid of the Quote Of The Week, and just post a random quote with every post.  It's easier on me that way.  Oh, and SubliMinal messages are OK by mE. (Laugh if you get it, think about if you don't get it)  Random Quote!  "Doens't it strike you as mildly ironic that most of the women against abortion are women you'd never fuck in the first place? -George Carlin.   Edit:  Goddamn my typing skills.  I've had to go back and change no more than nineteen typos.  Shit, I need to spellcheck more often.  Fuuuck

      Well, let's just say that blogger is stupid, and due to some huge error on their part, my old blog still stands, but I cannot access it to post in it.  So, I'm moving everything here.    Some things you can expect to see: Me ranting about various stuff; reviews of various movies, anime, and manga; random nonsense;  the Quote Of The Week; bunch of other stuff.  Tomorrow I'm gonna attempt to review The Day After Tomorrow.  Or maybe later today.  I don't know.   QUOTE OF THE WEEK for 6/02 (Changed on Wednesdays)  "I don't drink, I don't smoke, and I don't swear.  Shit, I do smoke and drink.  Well, one out of fucking three isn't bad."  - Adam_The_Unpredictable
