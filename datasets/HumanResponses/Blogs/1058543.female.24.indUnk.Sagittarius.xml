      Lord thank You and take away all fears that I have right now.  Give me and fill me up with Your love.  Right now I am scared and need your help desperately.  Please work everything out for Your good.  Help me love You and act on that love by loving other people and worshipping You.

      Father,  Make the deepest desire of my heart be for me to live to glorify You and have You glorified in me.  There is nothing else that can fit Your will completely in me.  Help and give me a mindset with this in mind.  I want to die to my flesh, so that I may be able to walk in Your Spirit and likeness.  I want to reject any part of myself and gain all of Your qualities.  I need You to save me from myself, or before I know it, I will kill myself, but not to You but to the world.  Save me from everything, give me Your strength.    Love, Hannah

      Lately I have been so confused of what I have been feeling.  I know that what I am doing is right, that I have God's blessing, that I am in His will.  Yet, at times I feel like I am having pride and lack of love and compassion.  I wonder, will I have the words to express all these things?  Will I make sense?  Why did I take this burden on myself?  Why didn't I allow God to help me?  Why didn't I go to Him and let Him open my eyes sooner?  Why was everyone so scared to tell me?  Why didn't I listen when they actually did?  Man, I can be a dumb man.  Yet, thank you Lord that You are bigger than me and all of this.  Thank YOU Jesus, that You are helping me through this.  Guide me Lord and show me when and how to communicate and love her through this.

      All my life I have been trying to please my dad.  God has continually told me, "Please Me and you will be pleasing your dad."  So then I continue to try to press on to be obedient to the Lord and follow Jesus daily.  As I grow and notice the truths in His word and the wickedness of the world around me, I get more and more convictions that I need to follow in my life and obey.  Yet, then I become a person that my dad doesn't want me to be.  He wants me to do nothing but get a degree and get married.  He doesn't want to wait for the right timing.  He doesn't want me to serve God.   He misunderstands so many points in the scriptures and then gets angry with me because I try to follow them out.  He is the only person that doesn't want me to go to Africa because I need to go to school.  He is upset with the way I am turning out.  Yet, since his expectations of Sarah are lower, I would say that he is equally pleased with both of us.  I'm not saying I am perfect or he should even be proud of me.  He has asked, "Can't there be something in the middle?"  Why does he want idle daughters that want only what the world around us tells us to?  Why doesn't he want me to serve the Lord by working with children in Africa?  The Lord has been so faithful to me and yet he doesn't even notice.  Yet, I can't have the hope of pleasing my dad, I just need to be obedient to God.   Many times my relationship with my father is the hardest struggle in my life.  I want to obey him and respect him as I am told to do in Galatians and Colossians and throughout the Bible, yet he doesn't even respect the fact that I am attempting to follow Jesus daily and to go where He is leading me.  My dad may never be supportive or see the views that I hold, but I know that they are of the Lord and Jesus is there helping me and guiding me.  Once again, Jesus tells me, "I love you, you are in My will.  Don't wonder what he wants, only do what I want.  Never feel bad for doing what I desire."

      Wahoo!  So much is going on.  I am praying about going to Africa and an application to Rainbows of Hope is being mailed to me today.  I am pretty sure this is the organization that I want to go with.  I hope Jessica likes it too.  It really seems like God wants me to go.  I pretty much just need to trust in Him to provide and show me the way.  God is good, all the time.  All the time, God is good.

      In the pamphlet, "My Heart - Christ's Home", Robert Boyd Munger is talking about how he was spending time in the morning's with Jesus in the living room.  He had been missing the daily time and hurrying in the mornings.  One morning he saw Jesus in there waiting and he asked Jesus if He had been there all along.  Then Jesus explaned:  "The trouble is that you have been thinking of the quiet time, of Bible study and prayer, as a means for your own spiritual growth.  This is true, but you have forgotten that this time means something to me also.  Remember, I love you.  At a great cost I have redeemed you.  I value your fellowship.  Just to have you look up into my face warms my heart.  Don't neglect this hour if only for my sake.  Whether or not you want to be with me, remember I want to be with you.  I really love you!"   I know this is how the Lord feels and that I really need to spend more time with Him.  Yet, He has been on the back burner.  I need to move Him up to the front and make Him my top priority.  I have in some ways, like with my convictions.  Yet I haven't with my time.  I continually put people as more important in my schedule.  I know that there are technically 2 front burners on the stove, but God needs to be on both.  Lord help me make you more important in my life.  Help me stand up for You and the things You desire for me to do.  They are important and I need to make the things important to You important to me.  Thank You for your faithfulness to me.

      There are so many questions that I wonder about the Bible.  How do I know how to wait while I am trying to figure them out.  I have been trying to figure out some things like:  1) Is the first part of 1 Cor. 11 cultural or literal  2) Is it okay to speak in tongues to oneself in a church service  3) How far must we go to prevent stumbling others  . . . Plus many more.  For example, 1 Cor. 14:34 says, "Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be submissive, as the law also says." 1 Tim. 2:11 says, "Let a woman learn in silence with all submission." According to the strongs, silent means silence and churches means a meeting place (jewish synagogue, church) that includes saints of the earth and in HEAVEN.  Yet, this word for woman means wife.  Where do the single women lie in this?  What are we called to do?  Is it possible for when the Bible says the word, "brother" "man" it is really referring to the male gender only?  I ask all of this not to bring more confusion, but to maybe figure it out.  I know that I am called to pray and study out this issues.  However, what do I do while I wait.  Do I be silent or do I continue to speak?  Is it my pride that makes me want to speak?  Or if I stopped to speak, could I end being like the servant that buried his gift in the sand?  I see both sides as not good options.   I just want to serve the Lord and to try to understand what HE wants me to do.  I know that I can't always be able to look, read, and follow.  Yet, I definitely need some more insight on this one.    Tongues? . . . 1 Cor. 14:18-19 "I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all; yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than then thousand words in a tongue. 1 Cor. 14:16 (Amplified)  "Otherwise, if you bless and render thanks with [your] spirit [thoroughly aroused by the Holy Spirit], how can anyone in the position of an outsider or he who is not gifted with [interpreting of unknown] tongues, say the Amen to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?" I guess my questions are: Can we not speak in tongues around other people?  Even if it's under our breath?  Can we not speak in tongues when other people are praying (in the known language).  This is what I am seeing in the verses, yet I am not seeing it practiced - even by myself.  Stumbling others. . . How are we supposed to prevent others from stumbling when we don't know what stumbles them?  How do we know if they are healed?  How can we be cautious?  As a group, can we prevent doing certain activities for the benefit of others?  Can we be sensitive to everyone's needs and struggles?  How far should we go for these things?  Just random thoughts. . .

      Last night I went to Quo Vadis.  We all shared what God has been doing in our lives, and I was able to share how God has been helping me with my fears.  Then, of coarse, comes an opportunity to face one of them.  As we were all talking about playing the jimbay, they asked if I wanted to give it a try.  I said, "No, I don't have rhythm".  It's okay, you just feel it.  "No, seriously, I can't hear it or feel it.  I do not want to play it."  Just when they stopped asking. . .   God says, "Is this another fear?" Me, "Yes, it's pride, huh?" God, "Yes" Me, "Alright, so even if it is Lord, I am not going to overcome it today."  I began thinking of ways I could maybe practice it at home to try it at a later date. Me, "No, I am definitely not going to do it today.  I will look and sound stupid.  I can't keep a rhythm." God, "So, I am helping you over come your fears?  You just told them all about it earlier. How about you actually do what you were talking about.  Overcome it." Me, "I can't get out of it.  Fine one song, that's it."  So, I did.  God finally won.  It was actually fun.  Who would've guessed it.  Micah seems to think I kept the rhythm throughout the song.  I know I messed up a little bit.  But it was actually fun and I did it!  Praise the LORD!  After all, it's all for him anyways.  He doesn't care what it sounds like.  Thinking back, I actually said to God,  "Lord, I am not going to overcome it today."     How can I possibly call Him Lord and not be submissive to His voice.  Isn't the meaning of Lord that I am supposed to submit and serve Him?  Hmmm, as I'm talking to Him, I use an oxymoron.  If I am not submitting to Him, then why call Him Lord?  Hello, that is so dumb of me.  Like calling Him Lord makes my desire of disobedience better or not as bad.  Yet, Jesus is consistent and really desires me to obey, so He did everything He could to help me be obedient.  HE is good and great.  Praise the LORD!, for real this time.

Lord, help me keep them there.  Help me Lord. Thank You for the continuing reminder that You are working on resolving my fears.  Praise You LORD!

      1 John 4:4  "You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because   He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world  ."  Oh me of little faith!  Why do I doubt?  Lord give me more faith and hope in You.  Build these things up in me.  Show me what my part is.  Lord, You are awesome and You are love.  Help me be made perfect in love.  ". . . If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us." (1 Jn. 4:12b)  I do not want to fear anyone or anything, make me have perfect love towards all Jesus.  I need to know how You did it.  Shine Your light in me and strengthen me Lord.  I love You.

      Tonight at home group, the Lord was really teaching me and reminding me of different things.  They seem so milky and at an elementary level of biblical knowledge.  But this is where I am at.  Tonight we studied 1 John 3.  Micah brought up how amazing the first phrase is "  See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us  , that we would be called children of God. . . "  I was thinking, 'yeah, so.  He loves us, but why is that so amazing, we already know this.'  Then God started to show me why it is so amazing.  As I have been dealing with all of these fears, God was telling me, "I love You.  You are My child.  I will protect You like any good earthly father.  I have your best in mind.  I know the best thing for You."  All of a sudden, wow, why do I doubt You Lord.  Why do I doubt who You are and Your love for me?  Lord give me more trust in You.    We also talked a lot about loving other people.  For the past couple of days I have been asking people, do I tell people the truth about the Bible and God's ways when they view me as holy rollers, Molly Mormon, and think I am putting myself on a higher level than them?  So many times when I tell my family something that is concrete in God's word like 1 Jn. 3:6-8, it's black and white and there is nothing anyone can do to change the meaning of it.  Yet, then Grant brought up 1 Jn. 3:18 "Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth."  Telling my family the truth about these things is loving them  in truth .  Even if they don't percieve it as love, it is still love.  Just as David reminded me, I need to pray for them.  I need to pray a whole lot.  Lord help me not give up on my family.  Help me realize You have Your hand on my family's lives and You love them so much more than I do. Micah brought up too that we need to be more open and honest with people.  Answer people's questions truthfully about our lives and not try to make people comfortable.  Chrissy added that if we are more bold with people and they decide to no longer have fellowship with us, then that can be a good thing.  It can show them what exactly is missing in their life.  They might miss it when it's gone.  Today I read about the flood.  It continually shows how Noah obeyed all that God commanded him.  It says how Noah was a righteous man.  Yet, the first thing he did when he got off the ark was get drunk and naked.  The Lord dealt with him accordingly and Noah dealt when Shem accordingly when he looked upon Noah's nakedness.  These chapters really show God's mercy and love in having a remnant of people that was saved.  They also show how the Lord has a balance of His mercy and grace with the need of being obedient to Him.  Lord help me be obedient and remember the promises You have given to me.  Help me rely more upon You.  I love You Lord.

      Come to find out I have more and more fears approaching daily.  In the past couple of days, I have realized just how many fears I have.  I have the fear of the Lord picking someone for me that I won't like.  I have fear of the unknown.  I have fears of looking stupid (like when I am dancing), which is PRIDE.  I have a fear of not being a good enough witness.  I also have a fear of the demonic realm.  I have a fear that I can't get past all of my fears.   Yesterday I read Proverbs 1.   vs. 33 says, "But whoever listens to me will dwell safely, And will be secure,  without fear of evil ." Luke 12:32 says, "Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." 1 Tim. 1:7 says, "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind." Psalm 112:7 says, " He will not be afraid of evil tidings ; His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord." Isaiah 35:4 says, "Say to those who are fearful-hearted 'Be strong, do not fear!  Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with recompense of God;   He will come and save you  ."  Lord, You give me some awesome promises and resources to rely upon.  Why don't I trust You?  Why do I doubt that You will come and save me?  Why do I doubt that I have been given more power from You than in the demonic realm?  Why do I doubt that greater is You in me than is of the world?  Lord, I admit to you all of my fears, worries, and struggles.  I know I have a lack of faith and trust in You.  You have shown Yourself to be more faithful to me over all situations.  Help me trust You more.  Help me remember all the times You have saved me from myself, danger, and my sins.  Help me remember all the times You have prevented me from making wrong turns in my life.  I praise You for how You have been faithful to me through all of my struggles, and through all of the victories You have helped me achieve.  Lord, continue to be my helper.  Help me go to You for help Jesus.  I love You, and I want to love You even more.  Amen.

      A while ago, I was reading Exodus 14 and verses 13 and 14 say, "Do not be afraid.  Stand form and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today.  The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.  The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still."  The Lord fights constantly for all of our battles, especially the spiritual ones within.  He is good and all we need to do is be still and know that He is Lord.    A couple of days ago I read Exodus 35:21, 36:6-7 ". . . Everyone who was willing and whose heart moved him came and brought an offering to the Lord fo rth ework on the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.  All who were willing. .  . . Then Moses gave an order and they went this word throughout the camp:  'No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.'  And so the people were restrained from bringing more, because what they already had was  more than enough  to do all the work."  Wouldn't it be nice if this was the problem today.  I think that we need to be wise to who we give to, yet I think it's impossible to give too much to the right source.  Everything I have is God's and I need to remember that.  It's not on loan.  The things that God does give me though, I should go to Him to show me how to use it wisely for His good purpose.

       1 Corinthians 5:11 "But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner - not even to eat with such a person."   Sounds somewhat simple now, right?  Wrong.  Applying this verse to my life is very hard.  My sister fits these things and now I need to figure out how to be obedient to this.  How much time is it okay to spend with her?  Are my parents supposed to ostricize her out of the family?  I don't know.  My uncle mostly, and also my cousins, probably claim to many people that they are Christians, yet they are drunks.  Am I not to go to any family functions?  Am I supposed to be like my Grandad and just pretend like it's not going on?  This is what I am going to seek out.

      Just as I think, "most of my questions are getting answered - or at least not as confusing", I get some new questions.  I am beginning to realize,  "THERE IS ALWAYS MORE TO LEARN ABOUT LIVING OUT CHRISTIANITY.  FROM THIS, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MORE QUESTIONS.  IT'S NOT BAD TO BE QUESTIONING AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO LIVE OUT THE BIBLE.  THIS IS ATTEMPTING TO LIVE OUT LIFE AS A CHRISTIAN."   I have been feeling like I have been legalistic lately, yet I haven't.  I am simply attempting to be obedient to the things the Lord has been convicting me about.  Have I perfected it, no way, I have a long way to go.  Yet, doing things because the bible says so isn't legalistic, it's being obedient to Jesus.       Galatians 3:1-3 says,  "O foolish Galatians!  Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?  This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  Are you so foolish?  Having begun in hte Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?"  So basically, I just need to be able to trust in God as I am doing things and not try to do it out of my flesh.  It's a lot easier to not be legalistic than I thought.  Just because others may think I am being legalistic as I am being obedient, doesn't mean it's true.  I can't make my walk decrease because of others misconceptions.  I am not saying this pridefully, I am saying it because it is more important to be obedient to God and please Him by obeying Him than by worrying about what others think about my walk.

      Sometimes I think "What am I hearing?  Who am I listening to?  How am I supposed to respond to it?"  So then I wonder, what if I am putting these thoughts into my own head.  Maybe, just maybe I want to hear what I want so bad that I say it to myself.  Then I go into the mode, "Maybe my whole way of wanting answers is so clogged up in my head that I couldn't hear God if He was even trying to speak to me."  Then I go to, "Well, God always talks, so Lord, open up and clear my mind that I may hear what You are saying not what I am trying to make myself hear what I want to hear.  I want to know what you desire."  Just a few thoughts that go through my mind, a kind of spiritual warfare.  Jesus promises in John 10:3-4 "To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.  And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice."  I know I am His sheep and HE is my shephard.  Even when satan tries to lead me astray or attempts to 'answer' the questions going through my head, I am not going to follow.  This is what this verse means, right?  Yet, Jesus will guide me and show me because I belong to Him and He is going to guide me in the ways in which I shall go.  I am supposed to always be able to discern what He is calling me to do.  Yet, what if I don't want to, then what?  I still belong to Him and my free will takes over.  Now I don't want this to happen, yet I know I choose the other way all the time.  If I didn't I would be sinless, and I am clearly not.  So is this just an honest attempt to show the every-day struggles in my life.  Maybe.  Does it mean it makes since.  Clearly not.  It only makes since to me.  I realize this, yet, I know that when I do discern and be obedient to God, then it makes it easier for me to hear Him the next time.  So, Lord, Help me be obedient to You and hear what You are telling me to do.  All this for, I finally have peace regarding the whole women issue.  I need not to worry about it any more.  The whole conflict in my head was killing me and just confusing me so much that it felt like my mind was leaving my body.  Yet, I have it once again.  Wahoo!  I hope and pray I have the right interpretation this time.  So, I am not to interupt service or teach man.  This is how I now look at this verse. (1 Cor. 14:34-35)  I now have peace and the comfort that the only Lord can fill.  He is good.  After years of trying to study and figure out the verses, I now know what He calls me to follow.

      Deuteronomy 6:4-9 "Hear, O Israel!  The LORD is our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates."  LORD, help me make You my life, and help me follow Your word.

      Leviticus 5:1  "If a person sins because he does not speak up when he hears a public charge to testify regarding something he has seen or  learned about , he will be held responsible." Numbers 15:30-31  "But anyone who  sins defiantly , whether native-born or alien, blasphemes the Lord, and that person must  be cut off from his people .  Because he has despised the Lord's word and broken His commands, that person must surely be cut off; his guilt remains on him."  1 Corinthians 5:11  "But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler - not even to eat with such a one.  I was wondering if anyone saw a connection between the OT passages and the NT passage.  It almost looks like the 1 Cor. verse is the NT principle from the OT verses.  It's interesting to me that it requires someone to testify even when they learn about it, not just when someone sees it.  God's word is always good, it's not always easy to follow, yet when it is obeyed, the reward is great.

      Romans 11:32 "For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all."  It's a shocking verse, but an awesome one.  He wants to show us mercy.  He wants to so badly give us what we don't deserve.  Romans 8:28  "And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose." 2 Timothy 2:13  "If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself."  These scriptures are awesome.  When we are disobedient, He, our awesome Lord and God, is still able to use it in our lives.  From this, we are able to begin to grasp part of His mercy, at least the mercy being shown to us at that particular time.  Praise the Lord that He is even able to use our sins to reveal His holy character to us in our lives!

       God's love    Micah 7:18  "Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity And passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of His possession? He does not retain His anger forever,  Because He delights in unchanging love ."  When we think we understand it, it brings us back to the Israelites. If we think we can grasp it or put it to a certain measure (even a big one), we are still minimizing it. The Israelites used to make idols, like themselves, and worship them. There's this song, and it's a good one, and one of the lines is  hold me just like any father would . Yet, I think the song should say,  hold me better than any father would  In a way, it limits God to a human father's standard.  He's God, He can do more. I just don't want to think I understand His love, grace, or mercy. I don't want to minimize them in any way with my own comprehension. I know they are unending, uncircumstantial, and uncomprehensible. I know we have a sovereign God and shows us how He loves us daily.

      LORD, Thank You for your goodness and all the blessings You give.  I can't believe how much I need You throughout the day and throughout my life.  I am so stubborn and stupid to ever think I can do anything on my own.  Help me ask You for help and help me lean on You, my sufficiency.  You are my Father and You are my Friend.  Thank you Jesus.  I think the most prideful thing one person can ever do is think they can do it without God or His help.  He is always there to help us, yet many times He is denied entirely.  I don't want to be that stupid.

        "Can't shake the devil's hand and say you're only joking."    This is a line from the song 'Your Racist Friend' by They Might Be Giants on their Flood album.  This is a powerful statement that is so incredibly true.  Many times I will blame my sin on me joking around or goofing off.  Yet, every sin is serious and choosing to shake the devil's hand instead of running toward God.  Something to consider the next time a trial comes. . . .

      I just wanted to put this in here because it is something I want to remember.  Once again, it's about a simple little prayer of faith from a sweet child.  Kerry Moy told me about a prayer that her daughter, Kendsey, prayed about a week ago.   "Lord, when Joey gets to heaven to be with you, teach him to walk on water like Peter."  As Kerry shared that with Lisa, Joey's wife, she found out that Peter is Lisa's favorite person in the bible.  Praise the Lord with His goodness and how He uses His children.

      Why is it that the people I expect the least from I see the greatest change?  Why is it the ones I doubt their love for God are the ones with fire burning within their hearts?  Why is it that even when I am  supposed to be in leadership  I still judge people by their appearance and even their character?  Why is it that these are the very ones that God uses within my own life to teach me a few things?  God says that none of us are above one another and not to think of oneself higher than he ought to think.  There were youths last week that showed me what I could have been like in high school if I ever had boldness - if I allowed God to work in my life and didn't try to hide Him everywhere I went.  Praise the Lord for the ones that are shockingly in love with the Lord and desiring to follow Him wholeheartedly.

        "Live in harmony with each other. Don't try to act important, but enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don't think you know it all!"  Romans 12:16 NLT    Can one verse have any more themes?  It was Air1's verse of the day, and since I listen to it ALL day long at work, I heard it many times.  It kept on speaking to me.  It's simple really. Be loving. Be humble. Be teachable.  Enjoy the company of ordinary people is kind of funny to me.  I think it means that people put certain people on pedastals - pastors, elders, leaders in the church.  Yet we don't need to spend all of our time with the godliest of the godly people.  We can simply love on and be friends with anybody.  It goes good with the verse, "don't think of anyone higher than ye ought to think"  Maybe that verse is "don't think of yourself more highly than ye ought to think".  Regardless, I think it applies to both.  We need to be humble and can't think highly of ourselves.  Yet if we elevate others, we will be let down and may end out making them an idol in our lives.  We must be careful and pray for God's help and love to teach us and sustain us.

       "Things don't always work out the way you want them to,  but things always work out the way they are supposed to."  My supervisor from my work said that yesterday.  She has been going through a tough time.  Even though I haven't been through anything bad lately, I think it is still applicable to any situation and anyone.  Ecclessiastes 3:1 says, "To everything there is a time, to everything there is a season."   So many times I will want to know something right away.  Where should I work?  What should I do?  Should I be going to school?  To become a teacher or occupational therapist?  When is the next stage of my life coming?  Yet, it will all come in the time that God has planned and that He allows.  I don't need to worry about anything, it will all happen when it's supposed to - when God wants it to.

      Tuesday night at home group we were worshipping and then we spent some time just listening to God.  God brought Josh Prior to mind - the guy that interviewed me for a position at Insight.  I didn't know why so I just started praying for him and his walk with God.  God told me that He wanted me to make a commitment to pray for him.  I told Him, "Well, if I get the job that will be easy because I'll see him.  But if I don't get the job than you'll really have to remind me because I'll forget."  God said again, "I want you to commit to pray for him."  "Ok, but please help me remember."  Next, God brought to mind the church directory.  I was trying to find his name in it.  As I was meditating on that, I realized God wants to use me to help draw Josh back to God.  I don't know what kind of walk he has, but I know God wants to increase it.  God wants to use me in some way in Josh's life - whether it's through prayer or through my life - i don't know.  Right now, I just have peace and know God knows.  This is all that matters.  Lord, bless Josh tonight and this weekend.  May You draw him closer to You and show him Your presence.  May he feel Your presence Lord, and may You give him a hunger and thirst for more and more of You.  Thank  You Lord for the work You are doing within him.  Praise You Lord for how You work in all of us in such different ways.  I love You Lord Jesus.

      I was talking to one of the girls in the youth group, and she was telling me about how she tries so hard to be nice to a girl but the girl just doesn't like in her return.  It made me start thinking.  John 13:34 says, "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another."   We are called to love.  Not just our friends, but also our enemies.  In other words, we're not supposed to love people just so we can get loved back.  We are called to love to be obedient to Christ.  That is all we can do.  For those people that just might not like our personalities or that we may have hurt in the past - just love them.  Continue to show them the love of Christ.  That is enough.  There's nothing else we can do.  This is something that we can rest in.  It may or may not effect the relationship with that person.  Yet, we can rest in the fact that we are being obedient to our Lord - Adonai.

      Today I went and washed my car.  But, only the outside of it got clean.  I told myself that I would clean out the inside of it later.  But hey - it looks clean, right?  I immediately thought about how people might try to appear clean on the outside, to the people around them.  However, in order to be truly clean spiritually is to be clean on the inside.  Continually repenting and confessing to the Lord, letting the Word wash us clean by the power of the Spirit and of the blood.    We can't just appear clean, we need to be cleaned by God.

      Last night I had a dream that I was at ASU East.  I saw an old friend from junior high and we were talking in the parking lot with someone from church.  Then, all of a sudden, everyone in the parking lot began singing and signing  I Can Only Imagine  by Mercy Me.  It was an awesome picture on a secular campus.    Romans 15:9-11 "and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written, 'Therefore I will give praise to You among the Gentiles, And I will sing to Your name.' And again he says, 'Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.' And again, 'Praise the Lord all you Gentiles, And let all the peoples praise Him.'"

      Influence.  It is a powerful thing. Paul was able to say "Imitate me as I imitate Christ". I see people with a huge amount of influence on the people around them. I see the people that look to them and are taking on the other person's behavior. It can be a very bad thing if they are imitating the wrong parts of someone's character. When we are in a position where people look to us as how Christians are supposed to act and look, we need to make sure that we are representing Christ as dear children.   It doesn't mean that we need to pretend we're perfect.  It simply means that when we make mistakes, we choose how to respond correctly and with integrity. May all of us youth leaders be the appropriate influence on the youth, that they may desire to draw closer to God and yearn to spend more time with Him.

      Last Wednesday at Youth Group, Allison and Jake did an awesome skit.  Allison went around and gave every person a candy bar, and Jake had to do 5 push-ups for them to get their candy.  After Jake had done quite a few push-ups, people stopped wanting their candy.  But, Jake still did push-ups for them even if they didn't want their free candy.  Every time someone was getting their piece of candy, Jake would look at them and say, "Ok".  It affected me so much because some of those kids that were there he doesn't even know their names.  Yet, he would look at them and then do his 5 push-ups for them.  His arms started hurting really bad, but he would just stretch and then do more.  In the end, Jake did 180 push-ups.  He continually did them faithfully until we made him stop.  Allison then said, sometimes actions mean more than words.  This is just a little glimpse of what the cross should mean to us and what Jesus went through.  We felt bad for Jake after about 30 push-ups.  Yet, Jesus wasn't even recognizable as a human when He was put onto the cross.  It was an awesome picture of what an average person can do to serve people, yet it can't even compare to the price that Jesus paid for us.  Thank you Lord for all that You went through.  I love you Jesus.

      "I am addicted to you"  I heard this line in a secular song.  It's awesome, if it's about God.  I want to be addicted to God, to the point that I would be:  *Sick without Him *Depend upon Him to make me happy and give me joy *He is the one that controls my life *Everything about my life is revolved around Him *All of my money is His and spent where He desires *I would not go long without spending time with Him  Jesus, You are the One thing I want to be addicted to.  You are the Lord of my life and I want don't want You to just be the center of my life.  I want You to be my life.  I want to be addicted to You.  I want you to be in my thoughts and heart continually.  I want my mind to be focused upon You and heavenly things.  I praise You and thank You for being my Father, my Saviour, and my Redeemer.

      The other night I got to babysit my little cousin, Dakota.  She clearly wasn't tired, but I had to put her to sleep - it was already 10:00.  At about 10:30, she was just lying in her crib and talking galore.  To who?  I have no idea.  Then I heard her say, "Thank you for Hannah, Mommy, Daddy, Dakooota."  Then she kept on saying all of our names again.  It was so sweet.  Perhaps she was praying.  I don't know, but this encouraged me that the Lord has His hand on her life.

      God created the moon and the stars to be the light in the world admist the darkness.  Saturday night I was in a church service and the Lord showed me how this is an example how God can use His creation to teach the church.  Just as Timothy and Silas helped Paul raise his hands (maybe this was Stephen), God has the body of a church lift up the arms of their pastor.  We can do this by praying for them, tithing, and supporting him in the decisions he makes.  The pastor can represent the moon and the church body represents all of the stars.  God promised Abraham in Genesis that his decendents would be as numerous as the stars. (Genesis 15:5, Hebrews 11:12)  In the same way, we all work together to be the light admist this darkened world.  Philippians 2:15 "that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world."  Let us all strive to be the lights of this world and to support our leaders as God has called us to do.

      Sometimes I wonder what all God is doing in my life.   I can seem Him working, and I can hear Him speaking.  Why is it that I will doubt when He does?  Why is it that are certain things that He wouldn't speak to me about?  All day Sunday, I was wondering who was going to be proving the childcare during the Danny Daniels seminar.  I felt that God had told me to work with the kids if they needed help.  As always, the faithful youth were in the nursery.  They are awesome servants.  Yet, Paul and Erin were with all the other ages.    When I arrived at the church, I pulled in right behind the Greens.  Zarah saw me and she just stared.  After I had caught up with her family, she was still staring and then her family started walking.  Finally after I started talking to her, she began walking as well.  I decided I was going to go in so I can talk to her and her brother John.  She insisted that I had to stay in there with her.  Once again, God uses a child to confirm what He had been speaking to me all day.    It was such a blessing, every child there was a blessing.  It was definitely a 3 person task, 2 people just wouldn't have been able to watch all of the children and to play with them.  Thank You God for the little gifts that You give to me.  Thank You for that gift on Sunday night.

      This has been a very weird week for me.  Monday night Kristen came up to me and said she just wanted to apologize for how she was mean to me at camp.  I must say, there are things I would change when it comes to my behavior towards her that week.  Yet, she apologized and I was in awe.  It was so random and heartfelt.  I owed her an apology as well.  Then the next night, I went to homegroup.  The first think little Allison Lott said to me was, "Hannah, I am so sorry for all the times that I wasn't nice to you."  I reassured her that she has been really nice to me lately.  She responded with "I know but there were times where I wasn't nice to you.  And I am sorry.  I shouldn't have treated you that way."  She's 4!  I was mind boggled.  Lord, what are You trying to teach me through all of this?  Should I be more forgiving and give more random acts of kindness?  Are you trying to show me that You love me?  Is this just part of the body of Christ and how we are to love one another?  Is this a time of receiving?  But Lord, I have been receiving so much lately!  Whatever it is You are trying to teach me, You are blessing me in the process.  I love how You use Your children - and sometimes little children - to teach me things.  I just love You Lord for You are good and You know how to give presents to Your children.  Thank You Lord for these.

      Last week at home group, Kim said,   God gives you the desires of your heart, after He puts His heart in you.   It's really true.  I can see it with my jobs.  The Lord put special needs children within my heart.  He told me to work with them and now they are forever in my heart.  Even though I don't work with them full time anymore, there's a part of my heart that belongs to them.  Working with them part time is a way in which the Lord continues to give me the desires of my heart.    That same night we went through an exercise where we write something down that we want to hear from God on and that we want answered.  Then we wrote what we would hope for the answer to be, what we wouldn't want the answer to be, and then the details of what we want the answer to be.  That week, my prayer was on where I should work.  Exactly one week later, I found out that I got the job I had applied for.  Some of the details that were answered: A job that pays atleast $24,000 a year (this pays $23,500 - close enough for me) A job that has benifits (yeah) A place that I can be a witness (Insight has a lot of drunkards) Some of the details that will be answered in time: A place/ job that I will enjoy A place that I can learn and not be bored A place that I can be creative Someone that I can move out with   God sees the answers of our hearts questions.  We may not see or hear them when we ask, but they are still there.  God just wants to bless us immensely - and He's really good at that.  Why is having patience so hard at times?

      Sunday in the toddler room, there were only two kids!  Wooh, it was so rough!  The three of us in there could barely handle it!  Anyways, during the story, I asked them if they knew how much Jesus loved them.  Joshua said, "I love baby Jesus this much!" and he opened up his arms as far as he could.  Then Savanna said, "I love baby Jesus this much!" and then she opened her arms up as far as she could.  They continued to repeat this taking turns.  It was almost as if they were fighting over who loves baby Jesus more!  It was so precious.  It's so awesome to see how kids show their love to God.  That was a completely different situation than when I watched 15 1-4 year olds on the 12th.  Cela watched 13 5-12 year olds, and she had it just as bad.  We were essentially on our own because we divided up the kids.  I truly could barely handle it!  Yet, I don't know how I would have been able to without the older kids that love to help - Katelyn, Jennah, Isaiah, Adi, and Katarina.  They wet paper towels and toilet paper to make wipes.  They did all they could to help.  Once again, they each wanted a turn to make a wipes for me - I could never say I had enough - until each of them made me one.  Poor babies (Annah, Melissa, and Eliana) that had to suffer through so many cold wipes everytime their diaper was changed!  Praise You Lord for giving gifts to Your children and using people of such young ages to bless me and help me.  They are awesome and it is so evident that each of them are wonderfully and perfectly made!

      Wow, it's been a while since I've posted last. . . . . .   Well, a lot has been happening.  Probably too much to talk about all at once, but I'll try.  On Christmas Eve my sister was saying that she had been having contractions for the past two days.  Chris and I took her to the hospital (because they were SO bad)!  We found out that she was almost 3 cm dialated, but because she didn't change during the four hours that we were there, they sent her home.  She wasn't able to sleep all night because they were progressively getting worse and they were coming every five minutes.  At 7:30 Christmas morning, she insisted we go back to the hospital.  She said, "Either this baby is coming out or they are giving me some strong medicine because they are 10x worse than they were last night.  I had no idea that it could hurt this bad."  Well, she was then dialated to 4 cm so they called her doctor and had him come in.  (Her doctor was out so guess what his replacement doctor's name was - Dr. Seymann - pronounced semen).  :)  Well, I guess he's in the right field!  Anyways, they soon gave her an epideral, I guess it's about 9:30 about.  Then they broke her water at about 10:30.  I went home about eleven because she was just going to sleep for a little bit so she would have energy later.  At about 1:00 Chris called me and said, you better hurry, she's going to be here in 10 minutes!  Well, I got there and there wasn't a doctor or even a nurse in the room.  But she was dialated to a negative 2.  The RN had thought that she was just going to come out without any pushing.  Sarah was pretty well off, but she did have to push - for a whole 25 minutes!  She lucked out but she was still in pain.  I must say, it was a beautiful thing to experience, and the miracle of birth is truly that - a MIRACLE!  After little Lilia came out at 2:12 p.m. Christmas day, she started crying and then all of a sudden she stopped.  When she came out she started crying so fast that some of the amniotic fluid went into her mouth, and she swallowed a lot of it!  She started turning blue and I think 7 nurses came in all surrounding her and taking the fluid out of her.  It was pretty intense and scary, but I don't think we really understood it at the time.  I just kept taking pictures.  So, they took her up to the Neonatal ICU and watched her there for about and hour, hour and a half.  We found out she was 5 pounds 14 1/4 ounces and 18 3/4 inches long.  She is so tiny, but perfect and complete.    Ever since then it has been bonding time with everyone!  She has already starting to show off and showing some expressions.  She loves having her arms straight up and stretching.  She is such a good baby so far.  She hardly cries, and yet it is still kind of hard to claim as a cry - it's so quiet.  She is so tiny that the shirt the hospital gave her fell off of her shoulder and her arm came out of the sleeve.  Anyways, she is a huge blessing, and my whole family is so happy that she's healthy, sweet, and SO cute!  Well, I better get more rest so I can spend more time with her tomorrow!

      \Fa"vor*ite\, n. [OF. favorit favored, F. favori, fem. favorite, p. p. of OF. favorir, cf. It. favorito, frm. favorita, fr. favorire to favor. See Favor.] 1. A person or thing regarded with peculiar favor; one treated with partiality; one preferred above others; especially, one unduly loved, trusted, and enriched with favors by a person of high rank or authority.  Thank you Ben for the link on your blog.  So, is it really bad to have favorites?  Hmmm. . . I have a lot of favorites, and really, the more I start to get to know a particular 'youth', they become one of my favorites.   It's really not that hard.  Yet, I do have favorites of my favorites.  (sshhhh)  Yet, each of us are God's favorites.  We can each say He favors us with partiality (it's called mercy).  So my philisophical argument is:  God has favorites. We are God's favorite. Other's are God's favorite. Therefore, We can have favorites because they are God's favorites too.  We are each the apple of His, He keeps us in the palm of His hand, He knows the number of hairs on our head, He loves us.  He really loves us.

      My (daughter), pay attention to what I say;  listen closely to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;  for they are life to those who find them and health to a man's whole body. Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life. Put away perversity from your mouth;  keep corrupt talk far from your lips. Let your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you. Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm. Do not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.  Proverbs 4:20-27  NIV  Sometimes I think it would be really nice for God to say, "Hey, pay attention Hannah to what I am saying."  I would probably obey Him a little more, I would definitely have less questions on what His will would be.  Yet, it might seem a little harsh if He did it too often.  It's just for those faith building moments . . . . when you have to take a risk. . . . and really trust that you heard His voice. . . . and that it's time to be obedient.  Yet, this is why I need to keep my eyes looking straight ahead, gazing them at the Lord.  I don't want to stumble or fall.  So, sometimes I'll take the easy road, sometimes I'll take the hard road, but hopefully it's the road that I will be able to look to Jesus for His help, strength, perserverance, and endurance to help me through it all.

      At times I have wondered:  am I dedicated more to the toddlers than the youth?  I have realized that I talk about the toddlers with the youth and I hope they don't think I love the younger kids more than I love all of them.  But then I realized, it's not like I can talk to the toddlers about the youth.  They wouldn't be able to follow or understand the concepts of the different ways in which the youth bless me.  I have realized that I enjoy both ministries so much and that they both bless me immensely.  I enjoy seeing the toddlers grow into their little persons and personalities and the different things they learn about God.  I love hearing 5 or 6 kids pray over the snack.  I loved when they remembered that Jonah went to Ninevah (that's a hard word to say).  I love when they all participate and listen to my 15 - 20 minute story / lesson.  As for the youth, I love seeing them worship, and I love seeing the way that some of the S.A.L.T. youth really do step up - like Jake Roessler when it comes to Darian, Zach, and so many others, and Joanna with all she does with her letters and planning of events, and Liz, Lindsey, and Kristen with the way they are so dedicated and always willing to step up and serve, and Jake Mullins with how diligent is is to clean the church, no matter if he feels like it, and James with his heart of worship.

      I have realized how much I love my Alpha group.  It's awesome to see some of the girls open up.  Each week, there are a few things that are constant:  Kristen - prayer requests for her Mormon friends and for a puppy. Sarah G. - prayer requests for her friends (there's always a spiritual battle) Danielle - always ready to read God's word, usually the first to pray of the youth Emily - always has a laugh attack, and then makes Kristen join in.  There are some gifts that I have seen in them and that became obvious to me last week when we were talking about the Holy Spirit:  Emily - intercessory prayer Kristen - children Sarah - compassion Danielle -  definitely has one, but can't think of it right now (might edit later)  Some of the other ways that the "sparatic" girls have blessed me:  Melissa - all of her questions of truly wanting to understand the Bible; her concern for the lost in other religions Kelly - her curiousity and spunk Megan - her love for people and animals (Lord please be with Megan's and keep Kelly's ferrets from running away)  Lord, thank You for my Alpha group and the girls you had Ben place in it.  I ask you Lord to continue to be with me and Kerri as we lead and show us the things You would desire for us to teach and discuss with the girls.  I ask You Lord to open us all up to share our trials and failures as well as the way you use us and help us overcome.  I love You Lord.

      Damian and Darian - they are cool kids.  I needed help to bring in groceries yesterday.  They were talking to their friends, but I let them know that I needed their help.  Without finishing their conversation, they stopped and came outside and then brought all of the eggs in.  They have also helped me out in the toddler room.  It's great when the different ministries you are in can mix together like that.   They serve - and I love that they help with Super Church and it's kept on the down low.  I have also served with both Kristen and Lindsey in the toddler room as well.  They both have the gift of children - if that makes sense.  They totally bless me.  I love being able to see the kids serve - and wholeheartedly!  Last night at the Renaissance, there was only 3 kids.  At snack, I asked them if anyone wanted to pray.  Addi said she did, then Kyndahl volunteered, and then her older sister, Bailie, said she wanted to pray too.  So, they all prayed.  It was awesome because the two sisters prayed for all of the children in Phoenix Children's Hospital and everyone that's sore.  That's awesome!  I think I am going to pick an organization like that to start praying for.  Hmmm. . . why did Jesus tell us we need to have the faith of a child?

      Lately, I have been thinking that I have been experiencing some spiritual warfare.  Most of the time when I am experiencing it, I don't even recognize that I am in it until it is over.  Yet, it has been so strong that I have been recognizing that I am experiencing it, and it just didn't seem to ever stop.  I think that it's finally over.  The past month and a half or two months have been really hard.  I have been noticing my trials, praying about them, asking for God to help me fight these spiritual battles, and in the end - I think that they are conquered.  Only through God are all things possible.  Thank You Lord, You are truly a very good GOD!

      Last night, I went to Central Christian's college group.  I had many preconceived thoughts about what it was going to be like from conversations with different people.  I was expecting a really big room, maybe filled with a lot of expensive furniture, decorated nicely (but hip), and filled with a bunch of young Christians that just hop from one another like it's a dating show.  (Yes, this is really what I expected)  Then, I show up.  It's in a small room, there are maybe 50 chairs set up, and I felt like the young one, where most people appeared to be 30-40.  Mostly everyone seemed pretty mature and were actually nice.  Why do I listen to other's opinions?  Why would they influence me to not to go to something where I am able to be in fellowship with believers?  I just don't really know.  However, I still felt awkward at first.  Yet, it was just like everything I have been used to.  It fits right in with the Vineyard and Calvary setting that I am used to.  Afterwards, we went to the Coffee Plantation.  I haven't really been comfortable yet.  I had been judging the place like I wasn't there experiencing it, but as if I was an outsider looking in.  Then I see Mandy there at the coffee shop.  Even though I have been with Jessica all night, I finally feel comfortable.  Seeing her there was just a simple boost of familiarity and somehow made my shyness go away.  Once I got over my preconceived thoughts and feelings, I was able to talk to some people - with realness.  They were really nice.  I was able to have fellowship with them.  I think it's awesome that believers are simply that - believers in Christ.  We can all come from different backgrounds and churches, yet we have gone though similar trials, similar experiences, and we worship the same GOD to help us through it all.  It is HE who is so faithful.  It is HE who will be faithful to us even when we are unfaithful or faithless, because HE cannot deny HIMSELF.  Even though it ended out being a blessing last night, when I got to church this morning, I became so happy.  There are so many people that I love at my church - so many people that just make me smile or laugh at the sight of them.  I am so thankful that God has allowed me to be apart of a fellowship like this.  I also love God for how He really works all of our lives together for the good of the church - both the universal and local.

      The Passion of the Christ  Praise You Lord that You are able to be seen in our secular world.   Praise You that You always reveal Yourself to this darkened world. Praise You that You save all people, from the beggars to the stars. Praise You Lord that You died so that ALL may live and share life in You.  This movie was very good.  It was pretty accurate, and I think that they did an amazing way of interpreting the scriptures and putting them into a film.  There were some parts that were hard to watch, yet it is no where near as gory as it should have been.  Jesus was scourged 39 times (3 separate times) - that's a total of 108 scourges at that one time (?).  It was illegal to scourge someone 40 times, so they would always punish people 40 - 1.  Yet, Jesus was not recognizable as a human.  He was the perfect sacrifice - the slaughtered lamb, that the ravenous wolves came and feed upon.  Yet, this is the only way our sins could ever be forgiven.  I must say it was very hard for me to watch some of the scenes in that movie, yet they don't even really compare to the reality of it.  You had it so much worse Jesus.  This was the last 12 hours of Christ's life, yet we watched it in two.  I don't know how You did it Lord.  You truly are an Amazing God.  Thank You Lord for all that You did just because there would be no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood.  Praise You Lord for Your goodness, Your mercy, and Your  grace !  Isaiah 53:11b - 12 By His knowledge My righteous Servant shall justify many, for He shall bear their iniquities.  Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong, because He poured out His soul unto death, and He was numbered with the transgressors, and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

      Who is harder on us?  God or ourselves?  At work, I don't think that there is a single Christian around me - well maybe one or two - the two new guys that started about a month ago.  Yet, it is so amazing to hear the words that come out of the mouths of my other teammates.  To call God a she and for someone to say they are not worried about heaven but they just want to make their customer's happy. . . other people celebrate how long they haven't gone to church. . . there are two mormon's on my team. . . . and others just love their sinful lives, they might not be happy, but they sure do love all of their sins.   Once I began to see how lost everyone around me is, I wanted to try to make more of an effort to be available for God to use me there.  If by some way I could be a light to the people around me, I want it to be done.  I want to shine.  Yet, there are so many times that I get stressed out. . . . especially lately.  I felt like I was yelling at people on the phone (HP, Qlogic).  I would also say things about other people that are so not edifying.  Yet, Friday one of the people I work with told me that she could tell when I get stressed out by the way that I sit.  She also told me that she has never heard me be mean to anyone.  Yes I have. . . to her even.  How could she forget the way that I was rude to her just the week before.  How could she overlook all of the times I would demand service from a manufacturer or another reseller?  Maybe I'm not yelling, but I'm just being assertive.  Whatever, they are pretty much the same to me.  Yet, was she telling me in her own subtle way that I may still be used as a light. . . can people really overlook my flaws and still see Jesus in me?  I know Jesus forgives me for my sins, but I still feel like a failure as a light. . . Yet, maybe God was trying to show me that I can still be used. . . that He can go past all of my weaknesses and still use me in my job.  Praise You Lord for that.  I know that my job has been used by God to teach me a few things.  When I first started working with special needs children, I did not want to do it because I didn't have the patience for it.  Then God told me, "And I can't give you patience?".  Not that I am the most patient person in the world, but I must say that God has followed through with His word.  When it comes to kids, I can be pretty patient - it doesn't matter the rate at which they develop.  They are kids, and I can understand why they do some of the things they do that can try us.  Yet, with adults, I have a lot less patience.  I think because I expect more out of them.  One day, I think after I got off the phone with Austin from Bubbles Car Wash, (I hope he's not a blogger). . .God told me, "I have given you patience with kids, now you need to trust Me to give you patience with adults."  Is there a better place for that then customer service?  I think not.  The past week has been evident that God has been working that in me. . . I have been a lot less stressed out and nicer to people.   Another funny thing is ever since I have bought things on my own, I have never been one to return anything.  I don't know why, maybe because I felt bad about returning it or maybe I thought the people would get mad at me for it. . . Kind of funny that I work in the returns department and allow people to return things everyday.  It was when I was shopping for my new bedroom that I started to realize what God was doing.  I had bought a sheet set at Walmart and some pillowcases.  It wasn't until I was making my bed when I realized that the sheet set came with pillow cases.  I didn't need any extra, and so I should return the extra pillowcases, right?  I didn't even have to think about it, I just did it.  I returned them.  Then, it was after I left with my money that I realized that God is doing yet another work in me.  He has given me more confidence and shown me that He can use all aspects of my job to help me grow spiritually.  He can also use me with the people around me.  It's amazing  how God works!

      Few people actually know about how spiritually unhealthy it was for me to be living with my parents.  At times, I began to take on my parents bad characteristics.  I took on my mom's insecurities and my dad's temper.  It's not a good combination - trust me!  Then I had an offer to move in with the Cloud's.  I had been wanting that for quite some time, people had told me in the past that it would be a great place for me to live.  Yet, I would never want to burden anyone or for them to feel obligated to help me out.  I also didn't want for it to look like I was making a big deal out of nothing about my parents.  It's just kind of hard to explain.  They have never encouraged me to seek the Lord.  In fact, when I was younger and I would come home from church camp - I was always so hungry for the Word.  If I went in my room and read my Bible, my dad would get mad at me.  He missed me after me being gone for a week, and he felt that I could always read my Bible later.  It was always more important to spend time with him than for me to read the Bible or do a study.  Sometimes he would say, why don't you read in here or study in here.  Other times, I think he felt convicted and he would say, you should probably do that in the other room.  It was always a stressful situation, and no matter what I did - I always failed them.  Now I live with the Clouds.  Even though I don't see them much - it makes me so happy to go home at night.  It is so much for healthy spiritually.  Just to see how they all relate with each other is awesome.  Last Saturday, everybody was home.  It was so cute to see how Jennah was playing with Mandy, and Noah was playing with Ben.  Then, Noah was playing with Mandy, and Jennah was playing with Ben.  They continued switching parents and playing with each other.  Both kids and parents were getting individualized attention from the other.  Then, they all played together a game of Crazy 8's.  It was such a blessing to be able to observe that.  I love living there, and I must say I never thought that I could be blessed this much.  I don't think that I could ask for a better living situation for me.  They are truly an awesome, incredible family.

      Thank you Lord for You are good, Your mercy endures forever.  Praise you for everything You did in the youth, for using us leaders, and for blessing us beyond comprehension this weekend.  Your children are beautiful, and You are a very creative God.  Be with us this week, and continue all of the works you are doing within the youth.  Continue to raise them up into leaders and call us to a high standard that we may be able to be examples to them.    Thank You for You are a very good God!  :)

      Sometimes it is good just to notice creation - to look around at the amazingness of God's creatures.  For a few weeks, I was seeing birds everywhere.  They were always doing something that just absolutely amazed me.   One time they were all in a tree that had no leaves on its branches.  I thought it was just a normal tree that was covered with leaves.  Then, as I got closer, I realized that the tree was just completely filled with birds.  Another time I saw the birds playing a game.  There was a few of them, and lets say they were in order 1, 2, and 3.  Then bird one would fly and then the order would be 2, 3, 1.  Then bird two would fly and the order would then be 3, 1, 2.  It was so funny because they just kept flying and taking turns like they were playing a game with each other.    They also seem to have their own friends and family.  I saw a few trees all in a row.  Two of the trees pretty much had the same amount of birds in them.  Then one would fly to the other tree.  A few seconds later, more would fly to the other tree.  Eventually, almost all of the birds were in the one tree. .. at least until my traffic light turned green.   Birds are seriously so facinating to watch, as boring as a "bird watcher" would sound.  Yet, it's neat to see that other creatures can have personalities too.  Just remember, God say he takes care of even the sparrow and they always have their food.  Yet, they were always the birds that were looked upon as evil.

      com?mu?ni?ca?tion    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (k-myn-kshn) n.  1.The act of communicating; transmission.  2.The exchange of thoughts, messages, or information, as by speech, signals, writing, or behavior.  Interpersonal rapport.   The whole e-mail, blogging, text messenging, instant-messenger, and chat room scene. . . . Is this a superficial or real form of communication?  By definition, it is a form of communication. . .Yet, there are all the normal things that are usually obvious that we miss because of this form of communication:  body language, tone, expression, and the such.  Is it possible that we may get along with someone perfectly fine or even really well in an on-line setting but we might be at each other's throats if we met them in person?  Is it possible that you can't truly get to know someone without seeing their expressions and the such or even know their smell?  There is a definite positive side of it all . . . Sometimes it is easier to witness to someone you have never seen. . . It also gives you time to think and respond with prayer. .. I also get to see the different depths of my friends that I don't always get to see otherwise. . . Sometimes it is easier to type something than to say it outloud.  There are some things that we all know from each other by just our first impression of them. . . without a face to face encounter, that whole step is missed and it leaves us with preconceived ideas and notions about the other person.  Is this fair?  Can they be correct?  I really just don't know how I feel on this matter.  I really wish I had comments, because I really want to know what people think. . .

      Sometimes I am amazed at God's goodness. . . Sometimes I forget to even notice His overwhelming goodness. . . I wonder why. . . Is it the busyness around me or even within?  Is it the different things that I put as a priority in my life?  Although I love all the things that make me busy. . . . it is definitely good to be able to rest at times.    LORD. . . . .  Help me not miss the beauty of Your creation. Help me not miss the small things in people's lives. Help me not miss the things You have called me to do. Help me not miss the promises You have given. Help me not miss the simeple things of love that You do. Help me not miss the gifts that You have given. Help me not miss the beauty You have put in each person. Help me not miss the rest that You give. Help me not miss the peace You try to give - and I don't receive. Help me not miss the strength You give to meet my needs. Help me not miss Your greatness, beauty, mercy, grace. . . .  I need Your grace. I desire Your mercy. I love Your character. I hope in Your promises. I long for Your love. I hunger for Your word.  I need Your strength. I desire You. I love Your goodness. I hope in Your beauty. I long for Your guidance. I hunger for Your Spirit.  Thank You my God and my Lord, the all in all in my life.  Thank You for what You give to me every second of every day.  For this I thank You and I love You.  Your are more precious than words can ever try to explain. . . . . .

      Sometimes I don't know if I can handle the things around me.  I see the hurt that these people are going through and have gone through and I ache.  My chest hurts and feels bruised, my heart is beating faster and I am in physical pain for what I have seen people at work go through.  Michael has had a horrible life and if I had went through all of that. . . I wonder if I could believe at all. . . . would I be an atheist if I had his life?  Does God just have His hand on some of us more than He does on others?   I don't know, but Lord, please heal him for all of the things he has been through.  I know he says that he is okay, but I just don't know how he could be.  I know he is a strong person, but please Lord, help him become vulnerable to you.  Touch his heart, touch his life, comfort and heal him.  Give him the hope only you can give and be with him throughout this day.  I love You Lord, and I ask You to touch him today.  As for Megan, she is going through so much as well Lord.  Please continue to work with her and help her not being comfortable with the decision she has made in the past in regards to her current situation.  Continue to help her and show her that You can be her strength and source.  You can be her provider for all of her physical, emotional, and personal needs.  Oh Lord, be with her in the decisions she has - please Lord, help her make the one You would desire for her.   Thank you Lord for wanting to take on all of my burdens as well as the burdens of others.  I lift myself up to You and ask You to continue to give me the words to say, the compassion to comfort, and the wisdom to share.  Use me and take control of all these situation.  Thank You for Your goodness and the amount of love that You give to me.  I am so glad that I have a God that is too good to imagine. . . . Thank You Lord.  I love You.

      Abraham  Sometimes there are youth that seem like their walks are stagnant.  Then - there comes a slight change.  Abraham has always stood by his friends and talked during worship and the lesson.  Yet, Sunday, they brought friends and yet, he went up a few feet in front of them and stood by himself during worship.  He focused on God and set himself apart from his comfort zone.  The, during the lesson, he was by himself again, and he was intently listening to Obie as he was teaching and giving examples.  I saw the posture of his spirit and the hunger in his eyes, and God was moving, teaching, and working within his life.  Praise you Lord for the ways that You are molding Abraham.  May You continue to work within his life and increase his hunger and thirst for You.

      Sometimes the Lord does more than we can imagine.  Sometimes He uses us despite of ourselves, our abilities, and our weaknesses.  God is so good.  From time to time I wonder, am I being a light in my workplace?  Do others see Jesus in me?  Why do I work at Insight?   Is this really where God wants me?  Am I a true imitator of Christ?  Then, there are days like a few weeks ago.  Megan asks, "So, have you always believed in God and gone to church?"  Which, when translated into Christianese is "Tell me your testimony".  That was awesome.  Then, there are days like last Friday.  Jason and Megan are talking about how much I know the two of them and about the two of them.  Jason is worried that I know too much about him.  Then Megan says to him, "Hannah does not know everything about either of us.  I would never tell her everything because then she would not like either one of us."  To them, my opinion of them matters.  Why?  Yet, they know my character.  They know that I do not cuss and that I would not used the Lord's name in vain.  It's to the point that if she overhears me say something that sounds like it, Megan questions what I said.  Thank you Lord that she knows what I desire my character to be.  Then, there are days like today that still shock overwhelm me and my understanding.  I still want to pinch and slap myself and know that it is real.  I have befriended this guy named Michael lately.  Not very many people like him, but for some reason, our personalities click - maybe because we are both open books.  He saw the Passion of the Christ this past weekend, and that began our day long conversation about our belief/ lack of belief in God.  Throughout the time I have spend getting to know him, I could not figure out where his beliefs lie.  Today I found out.  He is an atheist.  He was a baptist until the age of 17 or 18 where he lost all his faith.  Today we talked about Jesus being 100% God and 100% human, the trinity, and the neverending debate of creation vs evolution.  He shared his heart with me, the things that effected his paradigm, and he was completely vulnerable.  In our conversation, he said things like "spoken like a true Christian" "I try to learn as much as I can" "I believe Jesus Christ existed, I always have" "when I had found out what had happened, it effectively killed any faith I had left" finally "well its nice to communicate with a person that isn't as much of a religious fanatic as most.  that's cool that you feel the way you do and I respect that entirely.  I just wanted to say that I enjoyed this very much."  Wow - you mean an atheist enjoyed talking about Christianity and God ALL day long?    Lord, please continue to soften Michael's heart.  Please heal him and his family through all of the emotional and spiritual scars that they have.  Show him that You exist and that You desire to poor Your love into his life.  Provide for him the evidence he needs to know that You Jesus are the Son of God and You are God and the Creator of this world. Lord, I also want to pray for Megan and Jason.  Continue to help them through all of their problems.  Continue to allow them to trust me and confide in me.  Use me in any way You seem fitting.  Thank You Lord for my job and the opportunities that You have given me.  You are truly an amazing God and when You do the things You do, I can barely contain myself and not stand up and scream, rejoices that You are a God that moves in peoples lives.  Continue to guide them in their steps and the hard predictaments that they are in.  Thank You for the love that You have for them and myself.  I love You for when You use me and when I feel like I am not being used.  I give You glory for everything You have been doing.  I praise You Lord,  please help me praise You with every aspect of my life.

      Throughout my friendship with Megan, she has had certain preconceived thoughts about me and my beliefs. Which can be good. . . What amazes me the most is this:  We were talking about our past roommates and how we love where we live know.  We talked about the drama of girls and the different types of personalities and little synocracies that they have.  After I told her about my first apartment and roommates, she ended the conversation with "Well, no wonder you turned to God."  It just mind boggles me that she, a "heathen", can recognize that.  I was totally blown away. I think that she is starting to see that God can help us and take us out of some troublesome circumstances. . . She is also going to read, The 5 Love Languages, along with her mom.  They both are excited about it.  They know that it's a Christian book and yet, they still want to read it.  Please Lord, may You use Your WORD that is in that book to change them, enlighten them, and give them hunger for You.  I ask You Lord to draw them to You and to speak to them.  Please Lord, give them the gift of faith.

      Tonight Set Apart came and played for the youth.  It was so stinkin' awesome to see two great bands come together and worship the Lord like that.  They brought new kids to church that we might not have been able to reach otherwise.  It's incredible the way music can really move people and speak to them.  Everyone in this band totally has a heart for the Lord and it's great to be able to witness how God uses other people.   Lord, I just ask you Lord to bless this new band, bless the previous members of both Bloodbaught and Dunamis and use them mightily for Your kingdom.  May You continue to guide them in every aspect of their lives and with the band.

      Last night at youth was awesome.  Sometimes I wonder how many kids we actually make an impact on, individually.  Then Juanca came up to me and told me that he missed me, because I have been gone for so long.  (I only missed one Wednesday and one Sunday).  He is so silly.  It makes me wonder though, how much time do I actually spend with the little guy?  I should maybe spend a little more. . .   Yet, worship at the end of the night was incredible.  First, it was an awesome blessing to see Vanessa be strong and worship with her heart "on stage".  Then, there was this kid right in front of the stage in the dead center. . .I don't remember his name, I think he may be friends with Jared Shipman. . .but he was worshipping his heart out throughout the songs, raising his hands, lifting his head, and it was just incredible.  I want a picture of him worshipping, because it was so incredibly beautiful.  Then there's little Juanca, who was worshipping and then crying out to the Lord, desperate for Him, and just worshipping with his entire being.  Crystal Cornejo, wow, - I have never seen her focus on the Lord like she did last night.  She completely surrendered herself in front of her friends that always talk and distract others.  It was a little piece of God reaching out to her and then her responding.  Then there was Joanna and her new friends, Christine and Justine, and they were all worhipping the Lord joyously - I love when new people feel comfortable to just worship.  It's so encouraging.  These were just all the kids I saw worshipping, in front of the couches. . . Praise You Lord for the work You are doing in the youth and for the heart of worship that You are giving them.  Please Lord continue to do Your work.  I will hold on to Your promise in Philippians 1:6  "I will continue to complete the work in you until the day of Lord Jesus". (I think that's right) Please Lord, complete it in all of us.  :)

       Relationships based upon real/ superficial communication   1.There are some people that I only talk to mostly in person or on the phone.  2.There are others that I have only e-mailed and spoke to on the phone a few times.  3.Yet, there are other people that I used to hang out with all the time, but now due to new circumstances in life, it seems like we catch up via e-mail.  Someone has told me that they think if you mostly e-mail someone and have never seen them in person, than this would be considered a superficial relationship. When I asked if I talk to someone 70% of the time via e-mail and the other 30 % either on the phone or in person, that person continued to say that that would be a superficial relationship. Yet, that same person is the 3rd type mentioned above.  We used to only hang out and talk on the phone, but now our communication is based via e-mail.  So according to that person's logic, our relationship has moved from real to superficial, right?  Yet, there are some people that I know more about and have more of an honest relationship with, due to e-mail and our communication that way.  Yet, after a while, it gets drawn out and it doesn't last.  Is it just like every other relationship where it goes in spurts of varying amounts of communication?  I really don't know.    I do know that no matter if the relationship is superficial or real, according to each person's standards, God is able to use us.  We are able to be a light into that person's life and able to make a difference.  We can still show God's love and still be able to care about people.    Ben's comment off of my last blog makes a lot of sense (even though it's poetic).  A person's skin doesn't make the difference or make the relationship/ communication more or less real.  It doesn't change who we truly are and what we're all about.  What does matter is that no matter what type of communication we're using, the most important thing is honesty.  It is then that a true relationship is formed and can be trusted to be true.  People can always lie as to who they are, and that is when the relationship/ communcation becomes superficial.

      Classic quotes from kids during VBS....  Addi Hoover (5)- "My favorite part of VBS is when the teachers love on me." Eric Thomas (4)- "Jesus is going to be so mad at you." (as another child put a leigh around his neck and was pulling on it) Axton - (4 1/2)"People usually think I'm two until they hear me start talking." another quote from Axton - "One way in which Jesus saves us is like when Peter was walking on the water and then began to sink.  Jesus then picked him up and helped him.  That's one way in which Jesus saves us", Then I said, "Axton, can you please repeat that because some of the other kids were talking and they couldn't hear you."  He replied with, "They heard me.  Why?  What's the point."  Classic moments.....  Gabby - She just finished repeating the sinner's prayer...Right after she said Amen, she picked her nose.    I know that Noah and Jennah did some totally cute things too...As with Addi and others...Feel free to post other classic moments or quotes from our week of fun on Lava Lava Island....

      Please pray for my friend Jason.  Today makes the 1 year anniversary of when his brother committed suicide.  Neither he or his family are Christians, and so they are not leaning on God for their hope and comfort.  He did not come into work today and so I am not aware of how he is doing.  Thank you.  Lord, I just want to lift up Jason to You right now.  I ask You to comfort Jason, his parents, his sister-in-law, and his nephew.  May You comfort them that they may be able to feel Your presence.  May You give them Your strength and sufficiency that they may be able to handle this situation and the remebrance.  May You pour down Your love onto them that they may feel no void.  Lord, may You also soften their hearts that they may be able to know that You are real.  May You give them the gift of faith that will cause them to come to salvation.  Thank You Lord for Your goodness, Your grace and Your mercy, and I ask You Lord to pour onto this family Your grace, mercy, love, strength, comfort, and healing.  Thank you Jesus, I love You so much.

      I have had a chance to spend some time with my little couisins lately, and they are just way too cute!  Kylie is turning 7 on the 4th of July and she just had her 'friends' birthday party yesterday.  Since she had a rock star party, she made up her own song.  She sung it to me Friday night, and let me just say watch out female pop stars, because here she comes!  :)  I Want to Be...  by Kylie Bowman  I want to be a girl I want to be a grown-up I want to go to the mall with my friends I want to be on American Idol I want to be a singer Oh Yeah!  Then, today Sydney (4) and Colten (5) were putting a puzzle together.  Sydney wanted to be the one that connected the pieces.  Even though Colten is the one that found the piece, he handed it to Sydney and let her put it in the puzzle.  I told him how nice he was being and how impressed I was that he was being so good.  Then, he replied with, "Yeah, I'm being really nice and good.  That way, I can get another cookie."  How can people not want to be around kids all the time?  They are just so dang cute!

      Isaiah 40:3-5 3 A voice of one calling: "In the desert prepare the way for the LORD; make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God.  4 Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain.  5 And the glory of the LORD will be revealed, and all mankind together will see it. For the mouth of the LORD has spoken."  These are some of my favorite verses (and they are in my least favorite part of the book of Isaiah). I personally really like the first 20 chapters and the last 20 chapters more than the middle ones. . .Anywho, these verses are good to think about for a couple of reasons:  1.  They are good to think about with trials.  God is able to make our way out of every trial a smooth path.  He can make every hurdle in our lives seem easy, and He can change every part of the situation and circumstances.  2.  God is able to do this when witnessing.  Sometimes we can think that some people are unreachable.  I have thought this about people at work, but yet, I have had a chance to share little things with each of the "untouchable" people.  God can change their hearts and make way for little tidbits of light and His word and love to reach His people.  3.  God can do everything.  He can do the impossible.  We are His creation, just like the mountains, hills, rocks...  He can do amazing things with them and He can do amazing things with us.  Praise You Lord for You are good and worthy of ALL of our praise.

      Disclaimer:  If you are aware of one of my other blogs and I have not personally told you that you can look at that blog, please don't.  This is the one that I like to share with everyone and the others are more for accountability with girls and for myself...  There is nothing against anyone, I love you all regardless, but I would just prefer if only a select few people look at my other blogs.  Thanks!  :)
