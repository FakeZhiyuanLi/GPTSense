      damn....summer is soo boring sometimes....school needs to come a little sooner....so at least i will have something to do other than sit at home rotting my brain watching tv. i really dont know why some people hate school so much. its actually really fun cuz u get to see all ur friends...and make new friends.......hurray!!!   ashley is once again pissing me off. it's 1:15 pm and shes still not here. and for some reason they dont have a phone so i cant even call her to see what the fuck her problem is......i bet shes grounded again for some stupid reason..... and katie has cross country today and the rest of my friends must hate me cuz they never call!!!!! so thats why i'm so excited for high school......i can make friends that arent from dms cuz people from dms suck.........even though i'm from dms........ahhhh! i'm confusing myself...

      ok... so after reading lori's blog for the first time i realize that she puts alot of stuff that i dont necessarily want her putting in...... stuff about me... and people.... and it kinda makes me feel a need to kill somthing.....   hmmm, knowing how much steven hates seeing his name in my blog makes me want to write a little more about him!!! because he doesent really appriciate the nice things i do for him......  ~lost his school scedual ~messed up his old camera  oops! those were the things that piss him off.....well, i did clean the basemnt for him...that was nice of me. especially when he couldnt have friends over unless the basement was clean......i'm such a good sister!!! hehehehe

      steven got all pissy at me because i lost his scedual on monday..... but its his fault for giving it to me in the first place, because everyone knows that i cant be trusted.....   i need a job, or at least some way to make money....i was thinking of asking the people across the street if they needed a babysitter, but then i realized that kids dont like me......then i realized that i'm not responsible, so the kid would probably end up dead during the first five minutes of the babysitting..

      i went to the mall a lot today.....twice actually. i got 2 shirts and some pants...one of the shirts is too big tho, because i was too lazy to try it on, but its 100% cotton so it should shrink.  i am on a mission to become fat......well, maybe not fat.....but i need to gain weight!!!!! i think it may be working cuz i think i gained 2 pounds during the last 2 weeks. its a start.....  so on my second trip to the mall today i went to sears with my parents because of the sales... and got some pants. Then i went to game stop to visit jeremy, who was troubled because of angry people looking for that new game. i forgot what its called....so i got myself a hug then left so my parents wouldnt get angry.

      steven screwed us all!!!!! its 11:25 and he was sopposed 2 be here at 11... so now my dad is pissed, and steven cant have friends over or use the car for a while....sadness for all. why do so many people like my dad??? maybe because they dont have to live with the crap from him... like how steven almost ran me over with the car and my dad yelled at me for not getting out of the way.......pissy

      it seems to me.. that i'm the only one who updates my blog daily... why cant everyone else write new and exciting things before i have to? my blog sucks...it has no point at all...the point of bobs blog is to make fun of hank....the point of stevens blog is to be stupid....then theres me, who writes about the stupidness of my daily activities, which can get quite boring at times.....  theres a big sleepover coming this wednesday........maybe i should explain. i suppose lani is spending the night so that she can get together with frank....but then steven needs to have jeremy spend the night...and steven can get drunk under the desk by himself because he has no one

      today has been boring. but i really dont mind because at least people will be over when steven gets out of work..... as i look at yesterday's blog writing i realize a lot of things. like how i have some sort of depression. maybe its not that severe, at least in my mind its not that bad, its not like i'm cutting my wrists. i just have my highs and i have my lows. yesterday i was at an extreame low...and today i'm not sure how i'm feeling. all i know is that i cant wait until tomorrow because i get to be in school again. i will get to see the people who make me feel good. my school friends,  ( the people i see a lot in school but not a lot out of school) then theres passing periods and flex block where i get to see my junior friends. thats always fun.

      i got a phone call this morning from my aunt irene. shes one of my favorite people in the world, along with my two cousins. they are coming over for christmas and i cant wait, its going to be so much fun to finally see them again. even though they're jewish, they celebrate christmas with us once in a while.  i feel so much better today after my conversation with paulina last night. now i know that if i'm feeling bad i can always trust that i can talk to her. its good to know that there's someone i can talk to.

      i have written so much stuff today. if you plan on reading my blog try going from the bottom up, otherwise you may not understand it. i swear, today has been the longest blog writing day for me ever. it feels good to write though. and since i was home alone pratically all day today, then i had a lot of time to think and write.

      lost inside an endless whirlpool of mixed emotions to many highs and lows to count cant predict what will happen next not knowing what to expect just hope for the best, but end with the worst then back to the best again. the people who surround me  are the only ones who can control my mood surround me with negativity and thats what i'll become thats what has happened the negativity has overflown anger has taken its throne i'm lost

      i just had a really good conversation with paulina...shes such a great person. i found someone that i could talk to about my problems and thats what i did, and so now i just feel so much better. we share a lot in common. she listens to me and gives me advice, thats exactly what i needed. thank god, now i dont have to fall asleep crying...again. my spirits have lifted so much now...i went from severely depressed to relieved and happy.   words of wisdom:          find someone that you can talk to about your feelings...someone that you can trust, someone who will understand. it will make you feel great to get it all out of the way.

      here i am again, alone in this hell house my loneliness surrounds me, getting worse and worse every day until the time i see the one, who makes me feel bright, happy, loved and its during those moments I wish that time would stop so that I could live forever. feeling so good, so happy but until that time arrives, i must wait. try to survive try not to let the sadnesses of my life get to me i simply love you, i know these feelings are true what would I do without you? without your voice? without your sweet face? theres some sort of connection, there must be something there i feel what you feel your sadness is my sadness. your happy, I'm happy and thats how i know, how i can tell, theres no other explanation it must be love

      i did absolutely nothing today. no fun at all, i didnt even get to hang out with steven and i dont think i'll be hanging out with lani...everyones going to a party. i wanted to go see a movie tonight with liz but i dont have a ride so that sucks.  i just feel like shit. i wish jeremy was around but hes gone for the day, but at least hes probably having a fun day, thats cool. he always has something to do, i wish i was like that. damn, i hate my stupid brain!!! why am i so sad today? i just feel like crying and i cant even figure out why. i'm thinking of reasons that i am about to cry but i just cant.  i think i need to be around people more. thats it, i'm sad because i feel so alone right now, and i've been feeling like this all day. it sucks... i wont be able to hang out with anyone for the rest of the day. oh well...things will get better, hopefully.

      school on friday wasnt too bad at all. the ECC field trip was a lot better than expected. we were there to learn about jobs realated to our personal interests. We were put into groups according to these interests and i was in the artistic group along with a lot of my other friends, mel, nicole, sean, and stevens caitlin was in my group too. it was so interesting how i get along great with all the people who were put into my group, hmmm maybe because we all share similar interests. but anyway, we got to go see alot of really fascinating things at ECC. our group went into a dark room were a class was developing pictures and we saw a lot of awesome art....paintings and a lot of other stuff. then we all got to go to burger king for lunch where me and mel sat with this cross-eyed teacher with a long pony tail. it was strange because i was talking to him and none of his eyes were looking at me. but hes a cool teacher..... i had alot of fun on the bus ride was fun too. i had a lot of time to get to know mel, i spent most of my day there with her. shes cool and shes friends with pauilina too. finally, i  have two friends that actually get along with eachother so i can have more than 1 friend over at a time.   oh shit, lani should be calling me soon, maybe i should get offline.

      Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep, this air is blessed, you share with me. This night is wild, so calm and dull, these hearts they race, from self control. Your legs are smooth, as they graze mine, we're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all.  My hopes are so high, that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  The words are hushed lets not get busted; just lay entwined here, undiscovered. Safe in here, from all the stupid questions. "hey did you get some?" Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear... so we can get some.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember, I'll always remember the sound of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers and the time on the clock when we realized it's so late and this walk that we shared together. The streets were wet and the gate was locked so I jumped it, and let you in. And you stood at the door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it. And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it, that you meant it, and I knew, that you meant it, that you meant it.

      wow, falling asleep crying makes me really weird in the morning. my eyes look like crap today because of last night. they're all bloodshot and i have huge dark rings under them. i wish school would come back already. its so much more fun to be there than to be sitting here home alone all weekend. maybe i'll force myself to call one of my friends, i know they wont be calling me anytime soon.

      sometimes i just hate my life so much. so much that i could care less about being alive or not. there are so many things going on that i want to talk about with someone but i cant, another reason that i'm depressed. THers just no one that i can talk to about my problems, with my family, my friends, myself. its just everything about my life, the way i am treated by everyone, the way i act around people. sometimes, i just simply dont like my life...or it may be that i dont like myself. all of my thoughts and emotions stay bottled up inside of me, i cant talk about them with anyone. Theres no one who would understand me. who would? my mind is so messed up, theres no one who understands whats going on inside of me, i dont even understand myself.

      you're always in your dark solitude, pushing others away when what you really want is for them to be closer.  the ones you love will never know your true colors. never know your true feelings for them.

      today was a really interesting day. I had paulina come over after school. We went to the mall, i needed more clothes. and  we were just bored. I saw jeremy there too! he was there with some people that i've met before but i dont reamember their names, oh well. i didnt really get to talk to him but i got my hug and thats all that matters. wow, i'm obsessed with hugs. but its just that they are so great. I could be the most depressed person in the world but if i just got a jeremy hug, everything would feel better.  wow, 7 out of 77 people are online. and no one is talking to me, but thats ok, i need peace when i'm blog writing. what am i sopposed to do all weekend? i think i'll call lani or karina.

      ahhh! the mexican next to my locker called me "his ho" today.  my dads yelling at me again...yay! more fights and more anger! i get pissed off really easily. especially in the hallway when people walk into me, walk too slow, or just stop right in front of me and never move.  today's another monday, another week of school. fourth week out of 36 i think. but that just means 36 more weeks of non-stop fun and excitement! ha. actually i dont mind it at all. what would i do all day without school? i would need to get a job, i need something to keep me busy.

      i dont like my dad... not at all...well, maybe slightly. but there are far too many fights going on between us. i got into at least 3 fights with him today.  a bad word slipped out of my mouth. its funny how steven can yell swears at the top of his lungs and my dad wont hear him, but when a whisper of a swear comes from my mouth i get yelled at for half an hour?

      "Perfect little dream, the kind that hurts the most. Forgot how it feels, well almost. No one to blame, always the same. Open my eyes, wake up in flames. It took you to make me realize, it took you  to make me see the light. Smashed up my sanity, smashed up integrity, smashed up what I believe in, smashed up what's left of me. Smashed up my everything, smashed up all that was true, gonna smash myself to pieces, I don't know what else to do. Covered with hope and vaseline, still cannot fix this broken machene. Watching the hole it used to be mine, just watching it in my systematic decline. Of the trust I will betray, give it to me and I'll throw it away. After everything I've done, I hate myself for what I've become. I gave up."

      i hate being sick. i feel so shitty today...i didnt hang out with caitlin herman cuz i needed to rest a bit. and i took some cold pills but they're not working. I went to the mall yesterday and i was going to buy this shirt that fit me perfectly. It was grey with a little bit of black and it had a cursive letter on it that looked like an L but it ended up being a J. and they didnt have my letter so i was really dissappointed. i also went to the halloween store and the guy that worked there had a plastic sword and he was hitting me with it. joking around, but it still hurt. so i ended up having a sword fight and it was pretty fun. he showed me some vampire teeth cuz i'm going to be a vampire for halloween. halloween is going to be fun, I'm going to my friend hollys party that day.she goes to jacobs and i havent seen her since my b-day so it'll be fun to see her again.

      yesterday....wow....it was really crazy. i did so many things yesterday! had paulina come home with me after school in steven's car, but the ride took a while because of jewel and frequent stops between ryans dads and ryans moms house... and butterflies in the car...hehe so we were at our house for a while. ate pizza. then we went for a ride to paulinas house, which has got to be the coolest house i've ever seen in my life! and her mom was really interesting, in a scary sort of way. They all speak Polish in this house and when she found out that i was polish too she says, " i accept you"  hmmmm...................... and paulinas room is so awesome. its hard to explain. but to get to her room you have to climb up some really steep stairs .and her room  is covered in posters and drawings, because she is a really good artist. So then her friend Dan came over and we talked for a while, then he drove us to AMC to go see underworld. When we got there we met her other friends who were all gothic too. wearing the long trenchcoats and such. so blah blah blah.. we saw the movie, it was awesome and we drove home. which was not such a good thing because i was sopposed to be home at 1:00 and i got home at 1:40. OOPS! my dads being a bitch about it. He thinks we were doing drugs or something, but if he was a good dad and if he knew me a little better he would realize that i am extreamly anti-drug and smoking. and i was only late because the movie was longer than expected..almost 3 hours..

      i had a good day today...second one in a row. Thats so great!!! i'm so happy nowadays. last night lani came over and me and her sat in her car talking. and my dad came over to the car, and it was dark outside, and he was expecting to see lani and frank making out.  surprise surprise!!! it was only me and lani....stupid dad. and i got into another fight with him yesterday, it was about pizza. i wonder what kind of fight i'll get into today....maybe we'll fight ablout apples, or cherries! i can make a guarantee that there will be some sort of fight today. 100% chance.

      i was just thinking about when everyone goes to college. Its going to suck..and i'm going to cry, cuz steven will be gone along with everyone hes friends with, and i'll be left here, in the lonely house......and i dont even want to think about it cuz its just that horrible. I cant imagine my life without all those people. I want this year to last forever!!!!!  i'm going to go thorugh a severe depression once everyone is gone. its going to be so sad. oh my god!!!!!! i hate it.we're all going to be adults at some point and all of our happy basement memories will be a thing of the past. its going to be terrible.

I DONT LIKE SMOKERS!!!!!!  stevens probably getting a BJ right now. disgusting...only because its steven. i have to write a story by tomorrow. a personal narrative! how exciting! english has got to be the worst class ever! I cant wait till biology. I get to rip apart animals and see their insides!!! oh yeah, i feel like the guy from scream, but with animals instead of people. ha, i'm way too perky today. i'm looking at my nails right now, they're really ugly. THey look like guy nails, short and dirty and mis-shapen. i need my trusty pink nail thing that i got for free from my moms work. luch was so fun today. lauren was telling us how she was a mistake. then she yelled at travis for staring at her " googly eye" i didnt even notice anything about her eye until she started talking about it.

Streb's such a good guy...   so i made myself some food, 1 whole box of macaroni and cheese!! made for 2 people....but i ate it all! see? i'm not annorexic! but it tasted so bad and i cant cook. I should take a cooking class. i swear to god...whoever marrys me better be a good cook...cuz i suck at it.

And i hate how everyone suspects that i'm annorexic or something, just cuz i have practically no luch doesent mean that i dont stuff my face during breakfast and dinner.   I had an interesting conversation with travis, frank, ryan, and hank today. They were talking about sex....and masterbation. and it was funny. they kept asking me if i did it. haha, i wonder..........? so there was a lot of laughing going on and i learned a few new things about men. like how they get morning boners or something like that...hehe..so fun.   anyway...parents are back. how fun! more fights with my dad, great..............

      its 7:50 now. i'm home again, with lani, karina, and frank, and steven. today was tiring. I went to sleep late, woke up early, and rode my bike to the mall and back with allyse. The mall was not too fun. I didnt have any money cuz the bank was closed. i went to game stop and visited jeremy. and wow! i got a hug. then he suprisingly called me back at like 7:30. i hope this is a sign of change!  i think i'll go back and watch some tv with everyone else.

      yesterday was depressing for me. i was ditched by jeremy...again. cuz we made plans to hang out saturday, and i was so happy cuz i havent been able to hang out with him in a while. what the hell was i thinking? as if any of my plans with him would actually happen. it was terrible, cuz he was sopposed to call me, and he didnt.  if he would just call me back once in a while.....that would be nice. i called him on karinas phone, and i wanted him to come to heritage fest cuz thats where i was at the time, but no...he made "previously arranged plans" with someone else....but i thought he made plans with me!? so i was seriously going to cry after that phone call...and i would have cried if there werent people around. I cant cry in front of people. i'm not sure why..i'm embarrassed by it or something. cant show signs of weekness. so then i was at heritage fest for a while. i watched fire works...there was a lot of people there. me, karina, lani, lauren, steven, frank, hank, ryan, mike hanley, monica, miles, and i was hanging out with my friend liz for a long time. and there was a ton of people that i didnt know. and after heritage fest lani and ryan spent the night. without my gramps knowing of course...i'm pretty sure we got away with it....ha, i hope. but that kinda sucked too, cuz we were sopposed to meet frank, hank, and bob outside and we didnt. so i ended up watching steven, and lani, and ryan go online all night...ryan was having fun in the gay chat room...sending people pictures of pies. we all went to sleep at 3:45am. so now its sunday.......allyse is coming over today. i was sopposed to hang out with her yesterday, but since jeremy was going to come over i told her that i made plans. and what did i end up doing yesterday? sitting at home...doing nothing, i even took a nap... i never take naps! its 11:45am now. I'm going to take a shower and call my good friend allyse.

FOR 2 HOURS!!!! it was a really fun day...i'm actually in a good mood for the first time in a long while...its great

      homecoming....i dont think i'm going. i dont have a date. and homecoming is not really for me. I hate dancing, i hate dressing up, and its too costly for my liking.  school has been fun today. i like good days, their so.....good! i have a lot of ups and downs. it kind of pisses me off. why cant it just be all ups?  yeah...so i just got done with a really good conversation with ryan. Hes a smart guy. he gave me a lot of advice.  i seem to have extreamly bad luck with walking in crowded aeas, like the hallway where my locker is. i walked into like 5 people today. clumsy me.  i'm going to try to never write another offensive thing in my blog again. which is hard for me to do for some reason.  hank told me that i look like the kind of person that would do drugs. hmm.. thats strange. especially because i'm extreamly against drugs.  january is going to be fun!i get to be a snowflake leader at Dms and i will be able to boss the middle schoolers around along with Mike Hanley, Ashley(eeew) and the rest of the crew.  did i ever write about how i'm really pissed at ashley?  well..so she tells me about how long shes been smoking for and i'm like, "dammit ashley!! why the hell r u doing that?" cuz we are like best friends and i would trust her with anything...which would seem crazy to some people but anyway...i've always told her not to, and that i wouldnt be her friend if she did, but she doesnt seem to care.Now shes got her new friends that can smoke with her. and last weekend we went to the mall, and she goes outside with the guy from the arcade, and their both smoking. so i left...i didnt want to be around her. so i walked around the mall looking for a place to get change for a dollar and i made a phone call....to jeremy. its funny how when i call on a pay phone, he answers his cell, but when i call from my house, he doesent answer. damn that caller id.  why do i still like jeremy when he clearly doesent like me anymore? cuz thats what it seems like it sucks when you like someone a lot, and they dont like you back.   dashboard concert...ha, i'm not going. it would be fun if i did, ive never been to one before.   i met a lot more people today at school. cuz we had to do some group work. it was fun, one of the reasons that my day today was good. one of their names is bobby. i dont like it, i'm too used to bob, so now bobby sounds strange.  I had an arboriculture field trip today. extreamly lame, but i got to go to wendy's and i got to hang out with jeremy arendt. hes a cool guy...except for the smoking, but still.   hmmm.. i just realized that i get along well with people..all kinds of people. cuz the new people i've met at school consist of goths, hippies, preppys, punks, and like, just everyone! i think i'll get offline now, all this writing is making me tired

      ok, so if you're reading this you'll have to ignore my last post "THIS IS THE END" because i just realized that i need to write in my blog. i NEED to!!! my mind is way too messed up to not write about the crazy shit that i'm thinking. you see...i've had some sort of crazy overload of thought, and thats not good for me. so i'm here writing in my blog again.  yeah.. so now to this weekend, which is a very important weekend...because my parents will be in wisconsin all weekend...big plans big plans. not really for me, mostly for steven.steven's got some kind of "hit list" going.  home alone all weekend (my gramps will be here, but he'll know nothing!) i wonder what kind of things will happen in this house..........eeww!! i'm not going to think about that. My plans for this weekend? well, most likely my weekend will suck as usual, maybe i'll have paulina over....that would be cool. i like DCHS so much...i've met so many new people and its so fun.

      i had an interesting thought the other day... i was thinking what things would be like if i wasnt alive. life without me.....hmmm, i cant see how that would effect anyone. i noticed that i'm not a big part of anyones life... maybe my parents. god dammit, i hate my damn depressions. i'm so jealous of people like jeremy arednt...because he never looks unhappy...ever.

      ok then, i'm home alone once again. my parents are out on a walk with the dog, steven is at irish fest, and here i am....but at least i have a lot of time for blog typing.... So jeremy calls today, we talk for a bit....then i call him back to ask him a question, but he didnt answer the phone, and travis continues calling him back trying to hear jeremy's answering machine. so he got like 5 or 6 calls from our cell phone...jeremy thinks it was all me calling so hes probably pissed at me, i dont know why but he probably is. and he wont come over when hank is over...normally, people wouldnt care...as long as they get to hang out with their friends. but i guess he doesent want to hang out with me as much as i want to hang out with him. i had some fun today anyway

      i guess i wont be hanging out with my jacobs friends after all...cuz i called them and no one is around....and i wont be hanging out with steven either cuz they're all going to irish fest and i dont want to waste time and money there. i'll have to remember to never look forward to anything, because my plans always backfire... everything turns out opposite of what i expect..heres some examples --i was so excited for this weekend because i thought that i was going to have so much fun...well its the complete opposite. --i expected high school to suck...and its the opposite --i thought i was going to hang out with jeremy this weekend...i was wrong again... --i thought my tree class was going to be horrible...it was the opposite...theres some really cool people in that class that make it really fun. --i thought i was going to the skate park with the guys...and i didnt  and all of this stuff happened in one week.

      i cant believe that i'm saying this, but i wish i was in school right now. I dont hate it anymore. Besides, school is the only time i get to see any of my friends, cuz some of them dont hang out with me out of school. dammit, its only saturday, what the hell am i sopposed to do this weekend????? i guess i'll be hanging out with hank, frank, ryan, and the rest of those guys. its fun to hang out with them...i wonder if ashleys coming over today??? god, she is really pissing me off lately, shes becoming friends with all the wrong people, and shes going to end up as a 19 yr old single mother, living in a shitty apartment, smoking cigarettes, doing drugs, and prostituting herself for money.....haha, i should be a physic....

      after school friday sucks....really really sucks.  i would have had a great day if everyone in the world wasnt such a jackass to me. like how i was so excited to go to the skatepark with the guys today...steven, frank, hank, ryan, bob....but there wasnt enough room in the car so i was selected to not go...damn, my life really sucks.  wow, its crazy how fast a good day can turn into a bad one. god dammit. i think i'll just swear a bit to get rid of all this extra anger.....ass fuck bitch... ok that feels better...no never mind, it feels worse. i have a headache....why the hell am i constantly being ditched by all the people i think are my friends??? i bet i'm like secretly hated by everyone, and no ones telling me.. 6 people from my buddy list are online and not one person has IMed me...whoa!! i'm like so popular!!!!!!!!!!!

      i had a really good day at school today....thats always good. I'm starting to become good friends with one of the gothic people that i met...shes really cool, shes 100% Polish like me, and she was born in poland and she speaks the language perfectly. Then she tells me that she used to have bad depression, which seems to happen a lot with the goths....

      i really want to hang out with jeremy this weekend, or on friday after school...it seems like we never do anything together anymore, like just me and him, no one else....i'll have to ask him if he wants to hang out later.  RANDOM THOUGHTS -hank really hates jeremy, hahahahahahaha.......sooooo funny! -the ryan and karina relationship confuses me a lot -i woke up late today, couldnt take my morning shower....sucky -my hair is really dark now -my random thoughts suck

      tomorrow is friday, yay!!! irish fest too, i dont know why i care, cuz i'm not even going. i dont see why its so great. according to steven, ryan and frank, people go there to meet "hotts" and make out with people that they just met. maybe thats why i'm not going....why the hell would i want to do that anyway? some people just piss me off when all they care about is making out with a hott person....hmmm thats exactly what a not-hott person would say.........whatever, most girls that are " hott " are either extream sluts or bitches, thats why being ugly is so fun...people dont like me for looks... wow, i've got a lot to write about lately...

      havent written in a while.....god, that other entry of mine is soo long and crazy... today was my 3rd day of school....school's ok i guess. my classes all suck so much. Not one of my friends are in any of my classes, and its hard to meet new people cuz its always dead silent in every class!!! god, i hate it...so, i met 3 gothic people on my 1st and second days.... gothic people are pretty cool to talk 2....their names are paulina, mel, and nicole. hank thinks its really stupid of me to be friends with them... in dont know why, but i dont really care either way. flex block is the greatest!!!i get to hang out with all my junior friends which is really fun...even though i think they hate it when i sit with them....or not, i wish i could find out what people are thinking. that would be awesome.and i get to sit with jeremy, i like him so much.......... so my ex-boyfriend jon has gotten really weird looking....hes in ashleys category/ ghetto... and hes been looking at me a little too much. i think hes sad that i dumped him, but he did drugs and crazy stuff like that. why the hell does everyone do drugs?????? so i'm in arboriculture/ tree class... i was going to change my scedual but i think i might stick with what i got. that class is full of so many hippies. and they all seem to be smoking weed, which is funny because we learn about plants in that class so it seems to suit them. i met another jeremy today. jeremy ardnt, hes one of the hippies....so many crazy people... much better than middle school.

      steven got really pissed off at me this morning. i guess i supposedly pissed him off because i wanted him to pop the trunk and he didnt so i asked him a few more times and he turned bitchy on me, like everyone else in this world. especially today.  i hope i get a chance to go to the mall tomorrow...i sort of need to so i can get holly a birthday present for her halloween/ b-day party.

      i just got back from what might possibly be my worst day of school so far this year.  I am so annoyed by everything today. and u know what my favorite thing about myself is??? even if i'm in the worst mood of my life, i still manage to not take it out on other people. whats the point of making everyone else feel shitty just because i am?

I sort of dont pay attention in that class so i never really know whats going on. and dammit!! we'll have to do proofs and our supid teacher expects us to remember 30 definitions of ways to proove stuff and its annoying. 9:00 am right now. 2nd block is coming...   early release thursday and friday. yey! finals. boo! i need a ride home from school today. stupid steven. and lani has volleyball. and travis leaves right away so i probably wont be able to get to his car fast enough. what do i do?!? i dont like riding my stupid bus...grrrr

      people break down into two groups when they experience some thing lucky group 1- sees it as more than luck                more than a coincedence                they see it as a sign                evidence, that there is someone up there               watching out for them group 2- sees it as just pure luck                a happy turn of chance  so what group do u come from? for me..i would say group 2. no ones watching out for us!!!

      yep, i saw scary movie3 last night with lani and i'm probably seeing it again today with liz. eh, i dont really care. i would'nt cancel plans with liz for a stupid reason like that.   last night ended up being a ton of fun, once everyone got to my house. it was just me and karina for a while, then lani came, and frank, hank, bob, ryan, mel, and monica. then we all walked to the rock quarry, that was so much fun. me and karina were so hyper. ha, it was fun. going for walks in the forest! yeah..so then we all walked home and waited for monicas mom to pick them up to take them to the movies. while waiting me and ryan had fun throwing rocks at the yield sign. then we all got into our cars and left to see the movie. which was really funny but also very stupid. oh yeah, jessica and emily joined us at the movies. it was a lot of fun. -me -lani -karina -frank -ryan -hank -jessica -monica -emily -mel bob would have been there but he went with steven to a party.   so now its 10:00 in the morning. stupid daylight savings! or maybe its a good thing.... i'm too tired to care 'cause i had lani and karina sleep over and we watched signs last night, and i fell asleep with my contacts in so my eyes are messed up today.

      karina keeps lying to me!! she was sopposed to come over at 1:00 and now its 3:20 and shes still not here. i had another fight with my dad today. what a surprise! it was about tonight. he thinks i'm going to have some sort of huge party while they are at the wedding but really, i dont plan on having that many people over. and since karina doesent seem to be coming over, then i will probably just have jeremy over. thats about it.  i called him and hes napping now. and as soon as my parents leave and i figure out when they're getting back, i will probably call him back. so thats my day. and if that doesent work out then i dont know what i'm going to do tonight. but my dad's being so stupid. he thinks i'm going to have a huge party with like 20 people. i dont even know that many people! well actually i do, but still i dont plan on throwing a party. and my dad's threatening me and he told me to go to hell and some other stuff like that. and he says hes getting bob's parents to look out for cars in our driveway. god! my parents are so paranoid.  so yeah...i'm waiting for karina to get over here and i bet shes not coming. and i called lani, but shes with volleyball people. and i am yet again bored. plus stevens not here either. he has work till 9 and then hes going to a party. but hey, that might be a good thing. no parents, no steven, no dzaiadziu. just me. home alone for the night. and my parents are going to ruin my plans because they refuse to tell me when they're coming back! ahhh! i bet i will end up doing absolutely nothing tonight. because whenever i try to make plans things always mess up and i dont know what i'm doing now. wasting my day away..waiting for karina...and she wont answer her cell phone. eh...so stresed out right now.

      ...its late like 1:00am. or should i be saying that it's early? well anyway, i'm tired. i tried to sleep but i just cant. I have these stupid problems where i just overthink everything. my mind wont ever stop and its getting so annoying. I hate what people from our group keep telling me... that i've changed and i'm paranoid about everything, which may be true, but i dont know what to do about that. i've been really paranoid about everything lately and i think about that and i just cant find a reason which also adds to my over-thinking mind.  I just needed to come online and write down what i'm thinking. it could be helping me keep my mind steady, or it could be making things worse. i'm really disappointed with my blog lately.  I havent been writing what i usually do. like i write too much in school and when i do that i cant really get the things i want down on my blog. today has been strange...more over-thinking things. i came home from school with karina and she left to ryans house while i went to christine's house to work on a tree class project. but me and karina made plans, that she was going to come back to my house at like 6 or 6:30. but she never did, and she didnt answer her cell phone either. and we were sopposed to have a sleepover. and i dont know whats going on with her. why was she at ryan's for so long? eh, i dont really know anything. but back to today's activities. i came back from christines and sat at home for a while, alone for like 3 hours or thats what it felt like. eventually, steven got back from workand a ton of people came over. it was like summer again. we had one of our old basement smash parties with like 10 people over. and it was great! i played so well today. i won a match against steven, hank, and travis. thats pretty good...right? yeah.so i was in my basement for the rest of the night. travis got a lot of humping done with lauren! oh it was so funny. i love it when they do something like that...something that makes me laugh so hard that i cant breathe. its fun! unless i suffocate..but at least i'd die happy. 1:10 am now. still, i dont want to sleep. i will end up sitting awake in my bed for a while, and that wont be fun. i cant believe this. out of the 88 people on my buddy list, there is not one person online. where the hell is everyone?! hey, this post is really long. i think that i will start a new one.

      heh...dont u love my confusing poems? wrote them myself, i didnt copy off of song lyrics or other crap like other people's blogs. i'm so unique : ) damn...i am so incredibly bored tonight.  went to christine's house down the street....and now i am done with her and waiting for anyone who wants to get over here, which at the moment is bob. i need to talk to him about his mental problems...poor bob, he doesent belong there. and that karina!! ditched me for ryan! she was sopposed to come over and now i have no clue where she is. and she wont answer her cell, so i left 2 messages...! no jeremy tonight..oh, i'm so jealous, hes probably having so much fun at his anime thing today. but at least i'll get to see him tomorrow...plus i get to go clean the fox river with karina and some hippies! wheee. where are my parents? where is everyone??? got home and no one is here, no karina, no lani, no steven, NO ONE!!! i'm soo lonely. : ( hopefully karina will be spending the night here..if i ever find out where she is...i hope shes not lost...or got raped in the forest...eeew. poor karina.  i think i will go and call her now for the third time, and maybe wait for bob to get here...

      In my eyes, you're beautiful what does it matter, what everyone else thinks? What do you think? Believe me, you are spectacular your inner beauty is so strong that I can see it on the outside everything about you is so wonderful I wouldn't change a thing You're perfect the way you are whether happy or sad I can always see that beauty inside you

      anxiety is taking over i cant help but wonder whats going on inside you that blank stare in your eyes makes me wonder wonder what you're feeling because your expressions wont show it but if i look deep inside your eyes I can see pain, anger, sadness the same things that i see inside myself we're so similar, You and I

I havent found time to do it at home anymore...too many people keep talking to me online!  yesterday i had lani, karina, megan, bob, hank, frank, and steven over. We all watched their skating videos and poor ryan! he had such a big fall! and i'm sad because i guess hes in surgery today. i want to go and visit him.....  yesterday was so much fun...girls night out!!! me, lani, karina, megan all went to the rock quarry when it was dark...and there were 2 bags of popcorn to be eaten! It was a bit scary, we went to the top of the ridge and into the forest and we saw four guys at the other side of the lake. and it was dark so we couldnt really tell how old they were. heh...i was acting really crazy yesterday...we looked at the stars and i saw the constellation that me and jeremy made up over the summer....then i saw a shooting star! and i had an awesome night. and we watched phone booth and I am Sam that night too. what a great day to get out of school early! plus me and karina ate a lot of yummy food while megan and lani took a nap. mac and cheese...ice cream...rice crispy's treats. and maybe there was more...heh! i am not sure!

      i never thought it was possible to be this angry....angry and disappointed. dont you hate it when you make plans with someone, get excited for it, then get ditched. i should have expected this. i should have known not to get my hopes up and i did....and now i am disappointed again... i think everyone reading this will know what i'm talking about.. i just got so pissed off...i took a walk to a forest and just sat there..crying. thinking about people and how mean they can be.

      ANGRY ANGRY!!!!!! why am i always so angry??? i think i know why...because when i am happy i act like a douche and embarrass myself....for me, anger is good in small amounts. anger is like wine....a little is good for you, but too much is bad.

      i just had the most confusing day of my life...or at least thats how it seemed. i guess steven's really pissed at me because i like to go places with him....sorry for loving you steven. and i am just so confused about everything going on, people are saying things about me, and steven seems to be hating me, and ryan says that i've changed...but i dont see how that is..have i changed in a good or bad way? everyone changes. thats how life is, especially me, i change a lot over short periods of time. and now i am online trying to talk to people but everyone has their stupid away messages on and i dont like it.  steven needs to calm down once in a while, he needs to just ignore the fact that i'm there with him and have a good time. thats what i try to do. i was sopposed to go to chicago today, but things didnt work out...again. i knew it! my plans never go as expected. i was sopposed to be with paulina yesterday and i wasnt...i didnt even go to the skate park. and today was chicago, but that didnt work out either. so i am pretty much expecting sunday and monday to go stupidly... i wish i could just do what i planned for myself and not be constantly disappointed by everyone!!! i saw laura browder at monicas today. it was really fun to see her again...last time i saw her was on the last day of school. i had fun tonight, except for the confusion. but i had a great day, i am happy and maybe a little bit sad. i ate a lot today and hopefully i'll gain weight because i looked at myself in the mirror today and i didnt like what i saw...not just the disgusting skinnnyness, but everything. today is so strange and i cant even explain it. like...i had an awesome day. spending time with lani and karina was really fun. it was the most fun that i'd had in a while....  then monicas house was really fun too..but the things that people were saying just made me upset..and then i felt angry at a lot of people and i have stupid stupid feelings about everything.

      i went to wendy's twice today. first time was with lani and frank. then i went with john. he was hungry, i was bored...worked out for everyone. i had a really boring day at school today. nothing interesting happened, nothing new, nothing exciting...just a simple boring day at school. tomorrow will be fun though, i have plans with paulina and if that doesent work then i have a backup plan...yeya! so if for some reason paulina cant come over, i'll be going with the guys to the skate park. i love having backup plans...that way i wont have to worry about being disappointed. so many plans this weekend.  Friday--paulina/ skate park Saturday--possiblility of chicago Sunday--allyse's house( no parents) possibility of a party Monday--potential jeremy plans  of course....anything happening between saturday and monday could easily go wrong and i'll be left alone as usual, but i'll hope for the best.

      heh..karina writes some fun stuff in her blog. there was a  fight between her and jeremy last night...and eveyone was like.." lori is way more obsessed with jeremy than karina is with ryan" so jeremy was all weird because i guess i'm too clingy. but thats me..i cant help it, i dont try to be like that, its just how i am. i just want to spend time with the people that i like, and jeremy is one of those people. heh..stressful day, i talked to jeremy about it though. i promissed to try not to be like that again. i will try, so that things will be better for both of us. nothing to do today. lani would usually be over, but she has her v-ball game and steven is at chorus. home alone.....until parents come back. i wish they would just leave so we could have people over without parents, like how it was during the summer. i miss the summer. and yet, if it was summer then i would miss school. school sucked today...i was way too tired. i took an hour long sleep in geometry 'cause the teacher is going over slopes of lines and all this stuff i already know.  i'll be gone all day tomorrow...i have tree class field trip that will last all day. oh :(     i dont want to miss the whole day. only 3rd and 4th hour...I WANT FLEX BLOCK!

      today was messed up! i spent the whole day in my house, watching movies. then lani, karina, frank, and bob come and we decide to go for some tp-ing........and good lord!! we got hanks house so bad! i am very pleased with myself. :) so then we went for a hell trip to jeremy's house, but he wasnt there. then to lanis house, then to ryans house. and we stood in his driveway for a long long time. then jeremy showed up, and i hate everyone for making him angry, but i hope everything is alright now....EVERYONE LOVES JEREMY!!!!!!even hank...... he is jeremy's biggest fan!! yeya! and i guess i was sopposed to be home at 11 but i got home at 12:15. and my dad said that he was going to "kick my ass" but when i got home he was in bed so i just had a talk with my mom and we ended up wrestling and i got a few hits in..but were ok now.... my parents wouldnt punish me. why would they when steven is still outside somewhere...at 12:45!!! GOD, THIS HOUSE IS CRAZY.

      oooooo! i had the best day...EVER! early realease, then going home with lani and frank. stopping at wendys and seeing so many people was super fun...jeremy, john, mallory, blonde girl, other girl, other girl...heh, i dont know names! so after that me and lani and frank were at my house. everyone left to the dashboard concert leaving me and lani there for a while. we went to her house and back to my house again. then jeremy came over..yeya! so lani left to meet her volleyball tping buddies and i went to jeremy's. we were there alone for a bit,  then a group of people came over and i got to know some of his friends, who are all really cool people!! i had to leave early though...but who cares! i just had so much fun today! and the fun doesent end there! i still have to watch ghost world. aka: the best movie on earth. so thats my fabulous friday! it was great.

      oh wow, tomorrow is friday...the beginning of another weekend. i hope this weekend turns out better than the last one. homecoming is on saturday! and i'm still glad to not be going...i really couldnt see myself there. according to lani...we are having a "no homecoming" night with the people not going to homecoming. yay! how fun. i think it would be me, lani, karina, ryan, frank...and whoever else would want to join us. but i'm not going to get excited for it...i wont let myself be excited for anything. whenever i think that i'm going to have a good day it turns out bad, when i think that i'm going to have a bad day, it turns out good! so if my theory is correct...i think that i will have a bad day tomorrow, and hopefully it will turn out good. happiness comes at random for me...sometimes that can be a really great thing. but other times its not so good... i dont think anyone is going to understand what i just wrote. and if someone DID understand that, well then thats wonderful!!

      first day of october...and there was frost on the ground this morning and it was cold...too cold! i had a pretty good day today.although i missed flex block i still had some fun on my tree class field trip..we visited a nursery. theres nothing more exciting than that!!! haha but at least i got wendy's for lunch, and wow...i ate soo much food there. two orders of 5-piece chicken a medium order of fries a medium frosty and they made a mistake and doubled my order!!! so much food...i didnt eat all of the doubled order but i ate about 15 pieces of chicken today. plus the fries and the frosty. and at the moment i am eating a personal cheese pizza from pizza hut!! all that grease and fat better add weight to my scrawny self.  today was another spirit day for DCHS. i guess i was sopposed to be wearing orange, but of course i didnt....why would i have an orange shirt? my clothes consist of black and red...NO ORANGE!! the juniors got to wear green, now that would have worked out better for me..i have a green tank top.  ...jeremy was wearing a green hoody today. i dont think i'm seen him wear a hoody before, but he looked really good in it. even more attractive than he usually looks...he doesnt believe me when i tell him that, but its true. especially today, he just looked so good! tomorrow is super hero day and i'll be wearing my trusty superman shirt, i wish that i could be more creative with the super heros, way too many people will be wearing a superman shirt, but i dont have anything else, so i'll wear it. i'm happy today! thats good. its because i got to go to jeremy's last night. i'm always happy after i've been with him.

      its all really.....pointless??? yeah, whats the point of it all? we're born, we have our adolescence, our adulthood, we deal with shit from everyone during the process of growing up. yes, its true that we have good experiences on the way, but in the long run...its all pointless. we go through friendships...we try to keep in touch with the good ones but in the end...somehow everyone finds a way to let you down. and once we are old and are looking back upon our lives, what have we really accomplished?  Nothing.

      so today really really sucks....i spent all morning doing absolutely nothing...lani, hank, bob, frank, jeremy are over and still we're doing nothing. then i leave for food with jeremy and when i get back i find out that everyone has left to go to the mall....why couldnt they have thought up of something while i was still there? and the worst part is that jeremy was going to the mall and he could have taken me there and no one bothered to call me and invite me along and it all just sucks....7:10 right now...curfew isnt until midnight and i am stuck here....i wish my best friends would be a bit more friendly...

      i had an awesome friday. bobs band played at the battle of the bands and they won and they were so awesome and there was an after party and everything was just so much fun. and i got to see mel, monica, and emily and it was just so fun. i am a bit perplexed however....gaylen seems to have the hots for me or something, he gave me his cell phone number and asked me to call him and wow...he called me hot and its just kind-of weird because i dont think i am plus i just met him and i dont think he really likes me...i think hes just horney. so yeah...i am just i little confused...I DONT UNDERSTAND!!!  right now frank is at his house and his sister is having a b-day party and frank is surrounded by a bunch of 8th graders so hes coming over to get away from the chaos.

      me and mel had a really interesting conversation in gym today...as we do everyday. so we were talking about how most people go through a stage in their life when they want to commit suicide, or it was at least true for both of us. like, i went through that this summer...when i stayed locked up inside my room and i never came out and i hated everyone and i hated all of my friends who never called and i just wanted to die. of course i didnt really do it, i would never be brave enough to do that to myself, but the thought of it definately went through my mind several times. but now i am so happy....everything has changed, and it all started when i met jeremy and he started to invite me places with everyone else. so hank and ryan want me to be how i was at the beginning of the summer? well i dont think so, i dont want to be like that ever again in my life, no matter what they say.

      i really hate geometry.....it is so boring and i always fall asleep in that class as i did today. i wake up like 30 min later and the teacher is talking about something that i dont really know or care about. then i hear my name and i was spacing out and didnt know what was going on, so she got pissed because it is "an honors class full of bright people" and people like me who sleep in class dont belong there or some other bullshit...i wasnt really listening. but because of me, she assigns homework for the entire class and yeah....really embarrassing and theres these really smart people who hate me because i dont pay attention to the teacher. ----the end

      i hate myself...everyone hates how i turned out and everyone keeps telling me that i've changed and i am sick of it. i am never happy with myself....i am such a bad friend and i dont know what to do with myself anymore. it seems like all the people that i've been friends with in the past have let me down. and i miss my old best friends...the ones who i thought i would be friends with forever...like diana and michele and ashley. then two of them move and ashley...well, she just changed into something i didnt want to be friends with. then i call karina today and shes like driving people around and is too busy to pick me up and shes in sleepy hollow...it wouldnt be that hard to just come to my house. people wonder why i have changed so much... the reason is that i am unhappy with myself. i want to be different. i want to be liked and i want to like myself. i am just trying to find myself...

      so yesterday was the hotel party that i wasnt invited to...but hey i had fun. its not like i was un-wanted by anyone....except steven, but thats only 1 person. a lot of fun stuff happened..... hank fights steven....jeremy fights bob....bob fights everyone at the party (hehe) and he fought jessica...a game of grabbing. that was interesting.  ; )    so yeah...i didnt end up going to the movies which sucks...but i want to make plans with paulina sometime after school this week. but i cant really trust myself to make plans for anything. things never turn out the way i want them to.

      all my troubles seemed so far away....  ya...got out of school early. went to wendy's with everyone and i had a good time. jeremy was there too, with john. and we ate, had fun, watched steven rape everyone but me....thank god i am safe!   yep..so i was expecting to have a really great day but i didnt....ha, the system works. whenever i look forward to something..it turns out bad. and i looked forward to lanis dad NOT coming home so that we could __________ at her house....but things just didnt work out.  so we were sort of in my basement all night, and like...i wanted to spend time with jeremy so i had him over...but he must have been bored out of his mind and i dont understand....just being there together should have been fun for him. but everyone was stupid and didnt want to go anywhere or do anything and like...i just had a really shitty night. i really wanted to spend time with jeremy but i didnt really get to do that. so jessica and monica and  mel came over eventually...jessica sometimes is very scary-looking. and she gave me a hug then said she wanted a lesbian girlfriend. i dont understand!!!  so now i am sitting here online very early in the morning. lani i think went back to sleep and karina is gone somewhere. to get her drivers licence. then we get to go to woodfield. but i am not going to get excited for it, if i do then i will just somehow get let down again.  no one is online. i was hoping for john, because i am sopposed to go with him and some others to see the matrix revolutions and i dont know what time we are going, where we are going, or how i am getting there. most likely a ride from either john or jeremy. yeah...at least i'll be able to have fun tonight, unlike last night...ew. if lanis dad would have not come home....it just would have been so much fun, but he did, and it was boring. then i had to go and worry about everyone else being bored too....why the hell should i worry about everyone else.....i dont know...i am a good person...i think....a bit stupid....but good intentions.

      and i realized a lot of things... like one of the reasons that i am so attached to jeremy. and i cant believe myself...and why it took me until today to realize it. but everyone will be able to tell me that in the beggining of the summer i was really messed up.  i would lock myself in my room all day, i would never call my friends. even if they called me, i would make up an excuse not to go hang out with them.  i was a really angry person.  then jeremy comes around. he invites me to come along with him and the rest of the group. and for once i am begining to feel happier than i've ever felt in a long long time. i've become a much different person because of him. and what he did for me was one of the best things that anyone could ever do. he was able to change the type of person that i was...from a bad to good. that is a really good quality for him to have. so i will always have a strong attachment to him for that...one that i couldnt have for anyone else.   now i am happy!

And i am going to but lots of thread so that i can knit everyone a scarf for christmas this year. so far i am making one for karina, lani, lauren, and i am not sure who else wants one. so if you want a lori-scarf, please...done hesitate to tell me.

      todays one of the days that i get really angry and depressed because i have absolutely nothing to do. jeremy isnt answering his phone....but then again i think hes at work right now. anyway, karina has no way of getting out here, and lani is doing some sort of family thing and i might have to walk over to her house.   so ryan is out of the hospital and doing good. i am glad that everything went well in the surgery.

      last night was perplexing.  the whole family went to nicks pizza, me and jeremy met them there. then off they went to see lord of the rings leaving me and jeremy to go......elsewhere. there was an unexpected arrival of hank, frank, lani, and streb at my house and for some reason they knew the garage code. so they barge into my house at an unwanted time......it was all really crazy stuff. so i go outside to say goodnight to jeremy , then streb is crawling around the bushes on his hands and knees watching us.  but the time in between nicks pizza and the arrival of lani and co. was excellent.....oh yes it was grand. hehe

      today was a bored/family day. i spent the morning watching the movie jeremy got me, pirates of the carribean, with jacob. then boredom, then karina came over and we exchanged gifts. she got me red hot chilli peppers cd and i got her a green zip-up hoodie. then we went over to bobs, gave him his gift. went to franks, gave him some boxers ( and we got a strip show as a thank-you for the gift) there was much "shaftie" and it was quite intersting to see all of those pubies. then we visited ry guys house and i met his dad for the first time and he is awesome and i want to share him with ryan. now i am waiting for the family to finish watching terminator3 so that we can start on lord of the rings2. it will be my 5th movie of christmas break.  christmas presents tomorrow morning!!! and hopefully i'll get a cel phone yay!

      me and lani exchanged gifts today. i think the thong i got her may come in handy because when she came over she wasnt wearing any underwear and she kinda looked like a prostitute. she had an overload of makeup. it was lmost sexy...in a lesbianic way. she got me lots of chocolate....and best of all, dark chocolate! plus socks, a brown t-shirt, and black eye-liner! hurray i approve of these gifts.

       i took a look at bob's blog and it was quite humerous.  i enjoyed it very much.   yesterday was a fun/sucky day for me. after school me and lani were watching over karinas little sister while she was at home watching over the other two. we got the little one. and i rediscovered my hate for children....well maybe not hate....i just dont know how to deal with kids because the last time i was exposed to a little one was like 5 years ago when michele was around with brian. so karinas little sister drew some pictures on my hands....on of a butterfly and the other was a flower. shes so very cute.

      pissed off once again. i really want to visit ryan to see how things are going with him but i guess there wont be enough room in steves car for me. plus karina gave me a discussion about how ryan really wouldnt care if i showed up to visit him or not and that just made me kind of sad because ryan is such a good guy and i care about whats going on with him.....i even got him a cute card! as she said it would make no difference if jeremy showed up either. well thats kinda bitchy if you ask me...one of these days me and jeremy will unexpectedly show up for a visit

      i found it interesting to read monicas old blog entries about how she had a huge crush on jeremy. " i told her how i couldnt figure out if jeremy meant it or not when he said i was a heartless bitch and then i thought about this thursday. she fell alseep. i was thinking about whether or not he'd be working, cz i rather not he came over. ha, then i got more depressed cz i remember how in april and may i was so excited to see his cute lil red car drive up in fron of my house. how do things change so quickly" yes that came from her blog...lets say july? jeremy is for lori, not monica hehehe

"miss goth, miss doom and gloom!" thank you jeremy

      god dammit. i am really pissed at everyone today. i hate it how when one thing goes bad everything else just goes along with it and i am sick of everything today and i want to go sleep......as an alternative to death because hopefully things will be better by the time I wake up.  I know that bob is most likely reading that comment and making fun of me for it but today has been shit and everyone is bitching me out so i dont even care. dammit i almost cried and i would have too...but then my parents would be like,"oh lori whats wrong?" and i would get attempted comfort and i really dont need that right now. so once again the tears will be held in.

      i found the most excellent way to piss off my dad...or any other parent. when they are threatening u with punishments tell them it doesent matter to you. dad: "lori your not having anyone in this house for a week" me: " ok i'll just go to other peoples house" dad: "lori, dont be a smartass"  you see....the parents hate it when their punishments have no effect on you, and even if they do...dont act like it will have an effect.

      i havnt written for one whole week! amazing....so heres a little catching up. we started our 3rd quarter and my classes are not as fun as i expected them to be.  art is nice, but i think the people in my class are afraid to tallk of somthing cause i am the loudest one there.....and thats significant because i usually am not a big talker. then theres histoy...which would suck but paulina is in my class so its tons of fun! i'm lazy and dont want to explain the rest of my classes......biology-----sewing. over and out!

      glad i'm not going to jacobs....cause it seems like a mess that needs to be cleaned up. like everyone who goes there is either severely depressed or on drugs. maybe both.  in a sarcastic voice---> hey lets all be depressed! its like a fad thats going around! we can take one bad moment of our lives and turn it into a huge thing and then we can sulk around about it and have other people feel sorry for us. we'll tell them that we want to commit suicide and yay we're depressed. and when people still wont notice our pathetic depressed lives we'll cut our wrists and hopefully people will see and pay more attention to us.  damn attention deprived idiots.  if you dont like your life then try to change it. its not going to change by itself!!

      "anyways.....I need to talk to a certain gamestop workin fellow.....I dont know what is up with him...it is wierd...kinda creepy....w/e.....I guess I'll just have to try harder...or stop trying all together....."  --a quote from brandi's blogg.--  so i guess shes in love with my boyfriend...and its kinda funny for her to try and hide it cause whenever she sends him her stupid daily text messages i am with jeremy so i get to read them.... NICE TRY!  so she knows that i'm going out with jeremy. i even went to her damn birthday party with him! she knew it! however she decided to continue to obsess over him.....strange

      i am happy to say that we've made it home safely from our trip. (without any deaths) there was no alien invasions either....however the wolves were scary, and the fact that none of the guys had masterbated and were quite horney. then there was steven and his daily boners....a couple arouse on the slopes....which i didnt believe was possible but hey...its steve.  so i had fun and yet i also had no fun....i wish i  could have stayed home, but it wasnt nearly as bad as i expected it to be. all in all....it was a pretty good trip.

OR AN ALIEN SPACESHIP WILL LAND UPON OUR CONDO AND TAKE ME AWAY!!!! AHHH!!

      the snowboard weekend is upon us. i will be sure to take lots of pictures and share some with lani. hopefully i'll get a good one of frank nude or something. haha. i dont know if i'm going to have any fun at all. dammit, i wont be able to get away with wearing only a hoodie like i do here in illinois. i talked to my friend luke and discovered that he is going relatively to the same place as we are. it would be fun if i saw him there.

      i seem to be the only one who actually updates their blog daily. i havnt had another person's blog to read for almost one month.  hey, tomorrow is a glorious day for me and jeremy. 5 beautiful months since our first date. or for those of you who want to be more precise, it'll be 3 months on friday. i like 5 months better though.  i have a wonderful idea for a valentines day present to jeremy.....hehe

      i had such an awesome day yesterday. i got to spend most of it with ashley. then a small part with lani. a large part with jeremy. it was pretty fun. except my stomache was hurting so bad last night i thought i was going to die. so now i am at home and waiting for karinas call so we can go pick up some pictures from jewel then go to lani's to get our backpacks from her car.  my parents want to take me on a trip to northern wisconsin to go snowboarding. but its really going to suck for me because steven is bringing frank and hank. which means i cant bring lani, and karina doesent know how to ski or snowboard. i think i will be asking mel. she is my only hope. but if she cant go..or doesent want to go them i am screwed. for an entire damn weekend. and i cant stay home with my gramps because my dad doesent trust me. which is kinda smart of him because i probably would have jeremy sleep over or something if i was left at home. but still...it would be great if i could stay here.

      i need to throw up. i'm paranoid and nervous. i'm always thinking of the worst time apart is not for us i want to see you hug you and kiss you if i dont, my day is not complete  ......i feel so sick to my stomache right now. me and lani were ditched by everyone tonight. karina was off with ryan, bob was off with steven, jeremey was with his friends, frank and hank were snowboarding. and me and lani were left together, which isnt a bad thing. i just like to have more than one person as my company.  i get to spend tomorrow with my geometry ashley. yep, it should be fun.

      today was one of the weirdest days of my life. jeremy got really angry at me because i made a comment about frank saying that he is good-looking and has a good personality. but jeremy took it effensively and got really pissed at me. which completely ruined my 3rd hour class because all i could think about was keeping myself from crying or thinking about what i did to make jeremy angry. i didnt really see it as a big deal. but...i am also a bit more pissed because i wanted to hang out with him today and go to the play with him but i didnt. and i didnt get to do anything with him after the play either. then i get told that i wont be seeing him until monday.  so yeah....anyway, me and lani went to blockbuster to rent a movie and these 2 guys come up to us and start hitting on us and eventually one of them asks me for my number, but i told him "i dont think i want to give it to you" so he just turned around and left. haha.... so we went back to lani's dads and watched the weird scary movie about a girl who cut off some peoples bady parts and sewed them all together to make one perfect person. it was gross and slightly amusing.

      dammit....why isnt anyone saying anything to me online...  i had a good day after school. went with lani, karina, and frank to lanis house....drove frank home. then us three girls went out to eat at a texan BBQ place and they had awesome curly fries. i was sopposed to be with jeremy today but mitsuwa's was canceled....and i was really looking forward to the spicy japanese pork!  ewww.....i have homework to do and art stuff to finish and i also want to go to sleep by 10. its never going to work out.  and for some reason....whenever i talk to jeremy online today he doesent respond so now i feel like an idiot for talking to him when i get no response.  friday is mrs. loni's birthday and lani bought a beautiful cake for her. ohh its so sweet. and ryans birthday is coming up too. wednesday i think.  i am a paranoid bitch today... and i want it to stop. dammit!

      i was looking over old blog entries...and i realized how close i was to breaking up with jeremy....well heres one of those posts...................... "why do i still like jeremy when he clearly doesent like me anymore? cuz thats what it seems like. it sucks when you like someone a lot, and they dont like you back."---posted wed. sept 10, 2003  yep...i remeber those first two weeks of school when i was "seeing" jeremy but not actually going out with him. ahhh...those were the days when i was even more of an angry bitch than i am now.  so...during that time, i guess jeremy was being an ass and i was so close to breaking up with him...or telling him i didnt want to see him anymore. but who cares right!? things right now are perfect and thats all that matters. --------------------------------------------------------------------- another old post---posted mon.sept 15, 2003 "yay! i had a really good day today. and i got 2 hugs from jeremy!" oh my god, i was so excited over only two hugs.

      dammit no snow days make me sad...but school wasnt as aweful as i expected. sean discovered a new color.....and its name is....... .... ....  BRRRRRRROWNNN!!!!!!!!  hehe....damn inside jokes. but ya anyway my day was awesome. i got to have 2 hours of non-stop talk time with mel this morning...and i'm going to cry when 3rd quarter comes and i wont be in her classes anymore. .....cry perhaps..or just be really disappointed. we'll see  so there hasnt been a ryan at school for so long and he is definately being missed by everone. especially karina. poor girl... if jeremy was gone for that long i would have shot myself....but dont do it karina!! we love you!  hehe...i love my little mexico! so after school i went to jeremy's to take a nap...which we really planned on doing but then started watching anger management and the part where we were sopposed to sleep kinda got left out. it was fun anyway. but damn....stupid family dinners and lori being kicked out of the house. and no lani because of constant volleyball. my master plan is to sneak to her v-ball place with a knife and slice all of the balls....mwaa haha! i'm an evil little bitch.  and for some reason...i'm really happy. although i got my ass kicked in halo against bob, hank, steven, and frank....i'm the stupid little girl...who sucks at halo..........sad.

      wow! i swear, i must be a psychic or something! in my last blog entry, i predicted that karina and ryan would be going back out and guess what!?  I WAS CORRECT!!  the couple is back together and you know what that means?  within the next week or two, they will break up again... and by looking at the karina/ryan timeline....they will be fooling around soon after that and possibly even going back out again!  its an endless cycle....

      i would say that tuesday was the best day of spring break so far.  me, lani, jeremy, luke, and nick all planned on going out to bowling but when we got there the tuesday night crowds kept us from bowling so we decided on Portillos. so when we arrived luke did a little dance for us. then food. then standing in the parking lot for about 20 mins. jeremy and nick left. lani and luke started talking...thats when i got to drive lanis car around the parking lot. that was quite intersting. i was going like 2 mph.....rrrrmmm rmmmm. ( i make it seem so much better than it actually was.)  so then luke left and me and lani drove to Pats house hung out there for about 2 hours then i slept over at Lanis house. it was a good day, i got to see both jeremy and lani which makes me happy. ooh yeah, karina ws in there...somewhere hehe. she took me to a skate park earlier that day but i left her so that she could be with her precious.....

      poor pat, i feel so sorry for him. He has to clean up his house after a night of partying by drunk barbies and stoners. that was the party that me and lani went to last night..but it wasnt fun at all. there was the usual guys there plus claire and that other girl, but then somehow a parade of people came along and things turned crappy. and there was this guy walking around with a bottle of vodka and claiming that it was  his  bottle and he got a little defensive over it....so i walked around in circles going between the basement and the kitchen, then realized the party sucked and i started counting down the hours before lani could take me home. then the time came and i was home at eleven. hurray.

      I miss a lot of things in my life... i miss jeremy....not the kind of missing where u havnt seen them in a while. it the kind of missing where i miss the way things used to be with him. well thats the first thing i miss.  another thing that i miss is August. because everything that happened during August was great. that was definately the best month of my life. everything before that.....i hated. everything after that...well there was ups and downs. but theres nothing better than august 2003. that was back in the days that Steven and Jeremy got along. when the entire group would all hang out together in my basement and having smash parties and laying in the grass...looking up at the stars every night and going to the rock quarrey at night and sitting by the lake. everything good in my life happened in august. i met started going out with Jeremy i became friends with lani and karina. In fact, i didnt even have a life until august. everything was great and i miss it more than anyone will ever know... i just hope this summer will be like old times. u know, how everyone will have so much time and theres no school in the way to mess things up.  just dont foget how great things were during the summer. and try to brings things back to the way they used to be....

      today was so much fun. Consolation prize played at the Clear Water theater and they were so awesome. especially evan, he played so good. i got a ride from stefanie with mark and karina. we all went there and took pictures and hung out. it was fun. then we left to wendys, got food and came back to my house where me and mark played halo. it was fun cause our skill levels were practically the same but i won by one point and stefanie got so sad every time i killed mark. then i got to hear him play guitar which he is really good at. and the last thing we did was go to target and walk around there. this weekend was awesome.

      i love today. it was the best. first, i ditched 4th block gym to go home with Stefanie and while at her house we made some pizza and just sat around talking. it was fun. stefanies a fun person. and i got to see mark!! also nude pictures of mike and the tight pants people. that was...sexy.... so after that i walked to karinas house and stayed there until we could get her car and drive back to my house. then walked over to bobs where we all hung out. (me, karina, frank, hank, bob, and travis.) bob gave me a copy of his demo. it sounds great. then we all went to my house and sat in a circle talking until we decided to have a fire in bobs backyard. so we called everyone we could and had a ton of people over for a fire. it was the best. the guys found a christmas tree in someones yard and burned it. the fire was huge. then evan and bob played a duet on their guitars. everything about tonight was so much fun.... then getting anal raped by frank....hank giving me wedgies (in the back and front) and bob going into "cuddle mode" he managed to suck my neck while frank and hank held me down. and me being so weak i couldnt get away. and steven making out with the asian and getting raped....i think everyone got raped tonight. but it was just so much fun. travis was running around with fire on a stick and ended up throwing flaming marshmallows at frank. hehe wow so much happend. this weekend is awsome then tomorrow i get to spend the day with karina and we are going to see the play tomorrow night. and on sunday i get to see gaylen at the clearwater concert. life is fun  and i got to see so many people today.  stefanie-mark-karina-frank-hank-bob-steven-ashley(asia)-mallory-kristen-nicole-evan-monica-travis and some other people that i didnt know.  i am in such a good mood right now nothing can bring me down. not even......

      ok theres this game called "telephone"and all of us played it as children. or at least most of us. well in this game a group of people sit in a circle. one person makes up a sentence and whispers it to the person next to them. then the second person whispers what he heard to the next person in line until the sentence has been whispered throughout the entire circle. and when it gets back to the original person the sentence is spoken aloud and comes out completely different than what it had started out as.   this is just a little thing to think about before u make assumptions.

I cannot forget  I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do Follow me there A beautiful somewhere A place that I can share with you  I can tell that you don't know me anymore It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget And being on this road is anything but sure Maybe we'll forget, I hope we don't forget  I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do Follow me there A beautiful somewhere A place that I can share with you  So many nights, legs tangled tight Wrap me up in a dream with you Close up these eyes, try not to cry All that I've got to pull me through is memories of you Memories of you Memories of you Memories of you  I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do Follow me there A beautiful somewhere A place that we can share Falling into memories of you and things we used to do....

      and sad...i've never been this sad before in my life. it hurts.  i just wish things could go back to the way they used to be.  i knew it was coming...thats the thing that hurt the most. everything lani told me was true. i knew it was true but i didnt want to beleive it.  its just so sad to know that we'll never spend time together again....i'll never get to lay in his bed with him or kiss him or anything. now its going to be like...just saying hi to him in the halls....and thats it.....i hate this.

Count down till  your Jeremy comes back to you  :P"  notice the last part.....got me excited for a brief moment. lol yeah...my jeremy coming back to me........ that would make me happy, too bad that little away message wasnt exactly directed towards me in the way i wish it was...  listen to me...i'm a little crazy...                                                  ...really..crazy

      yesterday was a great day. got to hang out with lani, karina, frank, hank, and a little bit of bob.  i took a lot of pictures of our group then got them developed and added them to my picture wall..(which is turing out to be beautiful) then me lani karina all saw kill bill2. such an awesome movie. the first one was definately better with all the fight scenes and action but this new one explained a lot. really good.  so later that night i slept over with lani at her dads...i fell asleep real quick and at some point lani tucked me in. i was half asleep and i remember someone putting a blanket over me.. then i woke up the next morning to pounding at the door and lanis uncle started shouting for bill.  so this morning me lani and her daddy went shopping for carpet samples...looking at cars...and out to the manor for some breakfast and tonight is stefanies b-day party...that should be fun.

      i have gym 4th block. the same time as karina. but shes in excel working out those flimsy arms of hers.  i thought my class would suck but i found that my friend nicole was in my class with me which means fun level rising. i also met kristin rich's little sister. so it was a day of meeting new people. all we did today was walk around the track all hour watching the excel people work out all red-faced while we walked by with a cool wind in our hair. then when it was karinas turn to run i took a lap with her and died a little....i cant run...not after being out of gym for 10 weeks. but it was actually fun...woah me liking gym..this is new!

      so what exactly is the point of easter when you dont really have a religion? yet mother wants to have a big celebreation and dinner... right now i'm sitting around on the computer waiting for steven to finish up with the shower so that i can take one then walk to lanis house and feed the little beasts. and dzaidzu and dzuitka are here...that means mommy and daddy are leaving with them soon to go to the riverboat and gamble...to celebreate easter??? i think. i'll soon have to go say hi to the visitors...( gramps and his girlfriend) listen to her attemp to teach me polish and maybe she'll talk about how skinny i am and how much i've grown...the usual stuff.  yup yup gotta go say hi now!

      so heres a random note of what i did today: woke up, took a shower walked to lanis house and fed the kitties sat around at lanis house and watched tv then fell asleep..waiting for karina to pick me up karina calls and says she cant pick me up for a while...causing me to walk to her house. i stopped by around the corner candy and visited mallory, then continued my long walk... i looked at the pollution, saw a condom, a baby diaper, and a racoon. (dead) then to carpentersville where the scary mexicans honked their horns and shouted stuff....and sexual harassment.  so then got to karinas house...we left for stefanies party then found out that its next weekend and then walked back to my house...total of 10 miles of walking for me today...excersice makes me tired...time for sleep.

      hmmm....being sad, angry, and whatever else i have been for the last week has gotten a little old. i'm going to start to be happy again, hopefully jeremy will at least come and talk to me...even a "hello" would feel awesome. i am just going to live out this stupid break, regret it, and if jeremy really cares enough about me he will hear me out cause i need to tell him things. i also want to hear how hes feeling.  its hard for me right now. being ignored and AVOIDED( even worse). i cant even figure out whether hes at school or not. he must be good at this avoiding thing cause if i were the one doing the avoiding ( which i wouldnt cause i know that would hurt him too much ) i wouldnt be able to.. i just couldnt do that.  but from now on i'll try to stop talking about my problems... it hink i got my point across that i want to be back with jeremy. if he doesnt see that then i guess all that is left for me to do is wait. notice the description of my blog. thats exactly why i need to stop constantly writing  about him.  plus its annoying for me to try so hard to get back with jeremy and i'm really not getting through to him...i lost. what am i sopposed to do? oh shit...sorry......i'm NOT talking about jeremy again...but i am thinking. cant stop me there!  so today karina came over in her big 'ol mexican truck and we worked together on her textiles homework. we cut and glued pictures. yeah then bob came over and now monica and the rest of the guys are playing halo so here i am not typing away.

      ~ i really miss jeremy. I'm stupid and i know that. Everyone knows that. I made a terrible mistake and i really wish that he'd let me talk to him. ~ jeremy, jeremy, jeremy...thats been on my mind alot today..obviously. Oh f*ck i'm started to be annoying. ~ hey,  steven actually  does  have an asian girlfriend. i thought that was a joke but no, its reality. I think he really wants to be in a good loving relationship but he just pissed off whoever dares to venture into a scary Steve Piecyk relationship. ~i've been feeling like karina lately. ~ i hate F*cking caller ID..that really needs to be banned. cause people look on their phones and say, "oh shit its lori, lets not answer our phones" ~ i'm not going to stop. I'm not just going to move on when i want to stay. i cant just ignore you in the hallway, that just wont work for me..maybe u but not me.

      that just brought my day down to an ultimate low...but i cant really get mad at it. i mean, we  are  on break and i need to accept the fact that since we are on break he doesnt need to really talk to me...but still i'm trying to talk to him to end this break. and hes not around for me to discuss it with him. what the hell can i possibly do to make him realize how much i love him and how much i want to be back with him?

       today was just horrible...i miss jeremy and not only are we on break but he makes it worse by puposely avoiding me at school...and signing off on me when i try to talk to him online. i want to try to call him but i know he will just not answer me....i wonder if he wants to go back out with me as much as i want to go back out with him...  why cant he just listen to what i have to say? i want to tell him that i'm sorry, i made a mistake and i regret it more than he'll ever know....i just want to talk to him in person thats all

      August. its night time and we're all sitting next to a pine tree looking up at the night sky. its cloud-less and every star is visible. we make up our own constellation. theres tape laid sticky-side-up on the road and a car runs over it. everyone runs back to my house. later we are standing by all the cars in the driveway. i feel so close to you and i know u feel the same. cause that was the night of our first kiss.

      today i went to the mall with lani and knowing that jeremy was there i had to visit him. break or not i will always visit him. so i give him 4 cookies, made by me and lani...his response "these are burned..."   then me laughing. and scott accused me of trying to poison jeremy with cookies. then...sarah coming in! it was good to see her cause shes really nice and i hadnt seen her in a while. we all talk a bit and then i tell jeremy that it was time for me to go...he gave me peace fingers....::awww:: and i kinda just stood there. thankfully sara said something, " i think she wants a hug jeremy!" me, " no, i'm not allowed to have hugs anymore." but he gave me a hug! and that made me happy....wow i feel like its august again cause i'm making a big deal over hugs!   so about this break between me and jeremy...well i am not liking it.  i thought a lot about everything and i need to talk to jeremy and tell him whats on my mind. i really want to be back with him.  i looked through all of our online conversations and my old blog entires and those memories just made me hate myself for ending something so great...and i also realized that i'm a stupid idiot who gets angry over nothing. i dont want jeremy to change, i want to change myself.

      maybe i dont have hope anymore...which i understand, i mean, i dont deserve a chance because of my stupid self. today is so...blah! i sat around for like half of the day and eventually everyone came over like steff, mark, lani, and amanda. then frank, bob, and hank were over too. it was fun and mark showed me how he cut the pocket out of his pants so he could reach around and easily scratch his balls if he needs to! then he decided to undress himself until he was wearing only his boxers. hes so cute...especially when he blushes and sticks his head all the way inside his shirt. i love it. and peeing in the snapple bottle didnt bother me at all! even when he made me feel how warm it was! haha it was such a fun day.

My dad is happy to know that i'm not dating Charles anymore...he doesnt...like...black...people. and for me well i dont really care at all! minorities are all good...except those occational mexicans. haha my best friend is one so i cant really be racist.  today is such a damn boring day. i'm sitting around in my comfy Pj's and frank and the asian are over. maybe frank will come with me over to steffs and we can all be there together like old times.

It'll be sad going through an entire summer without seeing all these fun new people that i've met. by the way...i am taking a camara to school for the last week or so. be ready for pictures..i'll make copies for those who wish to have some.  so about that charles.... hes a real cool person and a great friend too but as a boyfriend...well....i dont know about that cause hes just too sex-crazy for me!! i dont want that, i want someone to love!

      ....so, I'm really stupid, like you didnt know that already..I fucked up something that could have been really great. NOw i have something that i really dont want because i know that i can be happier with...someone else..(mark) Its too late now because i made bad choices, really bad choices. i didnt mean to hurt him but i did, and i ended up hurting myself too, and i'm sorry for that. the think that hurts me the most is losing the chance to be with someone so cute-awesome-funny- the person that i liked, but didnt know he liked me back. I made mistakes--too many. Now i'm left with nothing. I deserved it all. he didnt. and i'm so sorry. --LORI--

I went oer to his house and watched a slide show of people in costume...and a couple pictures of girls flocking around him....hey as long as they're not sticking their tongues down his throat i'm ok with it.....yes i amm....ok with it...notjealous...thats right.....dammmit..  so he wasnt at school today..that was saddening. I at least got to see him yesterday. then dan came...i sat in silence as they talked about anime....of which i dont care for.i had no clue what they were talking about....fun times seeing him for the first time in 2 weeks....Âµ

      so all of a sudden i figure out about how much random people like my small and innocent ass... i come to biology class today and as i walk by my teacher i hear two words...Loris...ass. me: why are u talking about my butt? teacher: a bunch of guys in my 4th hour talked about how much they like ur butt.. me: you're mean!!! stop being so sarcastic! teacher: i wasnt being mean, it was a compliment! me:(yelling) MY ASS IS FLAT!!  i turn around and the class looks from my red face down to my rear...i hold my butt and walk back to my seat.  so i guess 4th hour biology has class discussions about me and my little one..ass

Your hand is smoke around my neck knuckles gripping hard white and intense your hold is strong and i am weak.

      ok...this is my little thought diary from my first day of gym this quarter...   "eww my thumb is fucked. what should i draw...my thumb drawings always turn out to look like penises. oh well. My teacher seems nice though, and somewhere out there is mallory. i used to hate her. no reason really, she went out with jeremy. i guess thats why i hated her. But now i've talked to her a lot. Shes in my first hour class. i like her shes real cool. and i really miss 3rd quarter. i didnt have gym back then and now everything is stupid....look at me now... the only reason that i'm writing in this stupid thing is to make myself look busy. shit...i'm friendless. and theres definately too many mexicans here."  "2:30...25 mins left. thats a long ass time to just sit here and write. why are people so stupid???  I already left the gym and now i'm back cause i have absolutely nowhere to go. I walked by lani/jeremys room. he was sleeping and she wasnt looking my direction. more pointlessness.  mmm...my foot is asleep. i really want to eat my giant chocolate kiss but...its...too BIG! thinking... 'i need to yell at you for what u say and write' fuck. i say a lot and write a lot. i need to figure out this little mystery.  what could i have done to piss him off?? my only guess is that i talked about him hurting me when i most likely hurt him first...but hes an idiot. how can we figure out these things without even talking to eachother? no way. he needs to talk to me if he wants to mend things.  the longer he takes the worse things will get. "  that was my little thoughts on the first day of the 4th quarter.

      after last nights play miles wanted to go to taco bell so thats where we all went. john amenta was there alone. said he was waiting for jeremy to come. stefanie bought me a quesadilla and it was yummy. eventually jeremy came and all i got was a sad little wave "hello and Goodbye"  so after food miles turned up the music on his car and we had a little disco dance party in the parking lot of taco bell. it was fun. then when it came time for me to go home to stefanies house for a sleepover lani all of a sudden cant fit 4 people on her backseat as if shes never done that in the past before. cause we had one extra person when bob skated over. so being the bitch that she is lani refused to drive us home so me and stefanie walked home to carpentersville alone at like 10:30 or eleven at night. it was really scary because 5 beaners ina pickup truck stopped next to us on the road and started calling for us and whisteling for us. it was scary cause if some rapist came me and stef would be helpless... so we called steven and he came to rescue us. we went back to stef's and sat in her room and talked for a while...and steven had his "bottle of water" that he was saving for later that night. so me and stefanie watched edward scissorhands and then fell asleep. THE END

      yesterday was a magical day...in the morning steven had hank and asian over. we all played team halo...me and hank won! then hank and steven wrestled while me and ashley watched. then i had a arm wrestle with her and we concluded that we have the exact same body type because no one was winning the battle. lol we are both skinny weak and squinty. eventually monica came over and they were going to go to hooters with the guys and out of nowhere steven invited me so i went in asians car with monica too. we had "girl talk" on the way there. and once we got to hooters we got a table...and since the guys werent there yet it was three girls at hooters and we laughed about how much we must have looked like lesbians. well the guys eventually got there and it was me, ashley, monica, frank, ryan, and steven. since all the rest had their dates frank decided to go as my date but he wasnt a good one. haha. then ashley dropped me off at karinas before the play. i hungout with her and stefanie until lani picked us up and off to the play!!  AT THE PLAY sadly jeremy sat in front of me rather than  next  to me. and he kept giving me evil stares..alex too! well i had stefanie! and karina too! woot woot! after the play jeremy left right away while the rest of us stayed for a while. charles was really sad so we tried to make him feel better.

      today was fun. i ditched 4th hour gym to go home with stefanie. we drove around and went to the mall. when i got home frank and hank were here. we talked about jewish people and nazis like ryanW. or people who wish they would be nazis...who knows. well the school eventually called and here comes.... Idiot Act of the Day#1: i stupidly dont answer the phone so my mom sits and listens to a call about me ditching....blah.. my mom didnt seem to care. she said dont do it again and that was the end of it. i got yelled at by frank and hank more than my parents. Idiot Act of the Day#2: so my dad has this jar full of quarters that accumulated to be about 600 dollars. well i "borrowed" five for going out to eat or something and i stupidly didnt put that damn jar back where it was and my dad finally figured it out today and more yelling for me.  i deserved it all....

      aka...bobby!...haha it was the best day ever! i got to hang out with bob, lani, karina, monica, mel, frank, hank, ryan, steven, mark and jeremy made an appearance at one point. we layed in the grass at my house and bobs house all day. it was fun. at one point we decided that we wanted to make a human piramid but the guys wanted a nude human piramid....well the guys got down to their boxers and for us girls...welll...girls are self conscious so we did nothing. ha. steven was being poopy and stayed inside the house and played ebox all day then i spent a lot of time talking to monica between 9 and 10:15 and bob and mel and a little bit of lani too...but i made a monica-realization. i used to not like her but i do now. shes such a cool person and i didnt really notice that cause i think karina brainwashed me or something....or maybe i'm just an idiot. and i read the wrong blog....haha i accidently read brandis...and i've come to the conclusion that she hates me even though i only met her once. its sad. those biz-notches.....

      heres today's activities.....wake up. take a shower. get a call from paulina drive to her house pick her up. find out that we only get to hang out for one little hour. thrifting...then each of our mom's picks us up. on the way home i talk to lani and go hang out with her and watched some weird movie about heroin. then me and lani went to marks and picked him up then we all went to a show for against the rest and...some...other ...band. i forgot the name. but the show was good. frank, hank, me, lani, karina, mark, joe were all there having fun. oh yeah bob's brother was there too....and oddly, out of nowhere he tells me that i'm hot after knowing him 11years....that was strange.  after the show we went to wendy's/taco bell and then headed to franks house.  the guys played some music for us and me, lani, frank, and hank spent the rest of the night watching skate videos in franks basement.  i would have had a good day if i didnt want to kill practically everyone there. but actually, lani paulina mark were the only ones who didnt piss me off. the rest can all go to hell.

      now i'm like karina and i can only blog type in school or at a friend's house. so thats why i'm typing right now in lanis house. yeah i went to the thrift store this morning with  paulina and got a shirt that wasnt very lori-like but once in a while i just feel the need for change.  so about "my problems dont matter to anyone" well i wont change it. never never never!!! haha jeremy.  so lately everyones been doing the same things in large groups.  example: during one week mel, stefanie, lani, and karina all got their hair streaked. then all at once people keep complaining to me about how fat/ugly they are and how ugly their hair is. especially mel who thinks shes fat and really shes not! and her hair is short and sexy but the angelie jolie in her is now gone.  like i've said. the only reason a person will complain about their looks to u is when they are in search of compliments.  yeeaahh the truth hurts doesnt it!?  well me and jeremy are back together which i havnt gotten a chance to write down yet.  so just thought u ought to know. i'm a happy girl now. and we got to hang out at my house 2 days in a row! its amazing we have never done that before but we did and it was great!!!

      i've joined the singles club with bob and karina. how...terrible. today was the worst day of my entire summer. i went to couch tour with amanda and steff. mark was there too and so many people that i hadnt seen forever, however i wasnt having a good time at all. then me and amanda walked off and she gave me some...disturbing information. "mark was drunk and had sex with some girl at ryan walters house" umm yea so i walked home from the couch tour by myself and cried all the way cause i couldnt believe it and it made me so sad i couldnt handle it.  and by home i mean lanis house cause i'm watching their house for the week however they forgot to leave me the key. i called steven and he came to pick me up with hank and joe. after picking up karina we get back to my house. i told bob what happened and hes like.."yeah mark told me all about his awesome night" stab in the heart#2.... so after being sad all day i go to clearwater and talk to steff about it and she tells me it was all a joke to give mark a reason to break up with me??? stab in the heart #3.... so i went and talked to him. he doesnt want a girlfriend, ummm that really sucks cause i liked mark so much and i could definately have seen myself loving him. but, it happens...  >me trying to act happier than i really am man..having to go through the pain of thinking ur boyfriend cheated on u...why would anyone do that

      reading stevens blog for the first time in months. i was really expecting more posts to be in there. if u really pay attention to it its rather depressing. and tonight i realized that i'm more similar to my brother than i thought. then i realized that i'm a bitch and i need to stop.  karina told me that me, steff, and mark are alike in one major way. in the way that our personalities change depending on who we're with which i can definately say that i agree with her. thats another one of those things i need to stop too.

      today i got home early from rachels. ate food-went online-watched tv-and went back to sleep. waking up by a phone call from karina. 2:30 shower...then she picked me up and we went to the mall. then to karinas where we attempted to make ourselves beautiful. watched tv and ate candy and were just lazy and calling all our friends like the ones we havnt talked to all summer. i called my friend jeremy and asked him how his "summer goals" were going.   so far he got 4 then i made a bet with him that he wouldnt be able to do it. lol. then i called my house and had my longest conversation with my mom on a phone ever. it was strange yet nice cause we just talked about stupid stuff like how steven was home by himself burning pennies??? lol thats what she said! then we drove to target and i got the velvet revolver cd which i am listening to right now and i think it is amazing stuff. then back to my house where steve-ryan-hank-streb-monica were there. we hung around outside then later on me steve hank karina and streb watched super troopers and hank fell in love with it. and karina fell in love with......ekk "blogs ruin lives" oh shit!

      yesterday was so full of events! i woke up at 8:30 karina picked me up at 9:30 and we drove around looking for cake and supplies for her sisters b-day party which i decorated most of it. sean came too to help however i left them which i feel bad for however i had plans with schmidts so i wasnt going to ditch those plans. me, ryan walter, mark, steff, rachel, and shandi all drove around. cough cough cough...they all smoked their cancer sticks. except steff. we are the good ones! we all went to my house for a bit and sat in the basement. mark sang us many songs while ryan played the guitar. it was wonderful. then fireworks came. we got a blanket and sat down to watch them but half the people we were with ditched us to go walk around. hmmm....well after fireworks we spent the night at rachels...me-steff-rachel-shandi rachels basement jus got finished and they have this thing called a love-sac and it was the most comfortable thing i've ever had the chance to sleep on. me and steff slept together on it and sunk into its comfy-ness. theres a picture of us on her livejournal...i have a link to it on my site.  well all in all my day was good and bad and everything in between

      today i had a million differnt emotions. sat around being depressed for the first half because my entire conversation with bob last night bothered me a lot. i sat around and made plans to just run away from home. it was pretty detailed too. i explained it all to karina how i would take out all my money from my bank account and sleep outside and all the other stupid stuff that i think of. well it could be fun for like a week. anway, i drove with lani and frank to see fahrenheit 9/11. the people at the theater were being bastards and not letting us in without an adult so this lady came to me and told me that shed help us all out. thank god for people like her. so after the movie me lani and frank went to visit a lonely karina and a verrry horney hector. we ate hot dogs. YUMMY!   karina was driving me home and we ran into hank so we parked in our court and the three of us talked for a nice long time. hank is really cool he and frank are the only guys from our group that i can actually like a lot and never truely be mad at them...  i am super-excited for tomorrow. its going to be a good long day. karina is picking me up at 9:30--we are going to decorate for her little sisters birthday party. at one point mark and ryan are going to come over and help out and possibly eat their food. cause they have so much of it! and then later on tonight we are all going to watch fireworks in carpenter park. but then again karina said we'd be able to get on top of her roof and watch them from up there. so i'm not sure whats going on but either way it will be fun.  then theres monday couch-tour at spring hill mall and tuesday i will spend the day with mel cause i havnt seen her since school. well my week will be good and now i'm not so sad anymore.

      hmmm..look how nice people are to me!  (Bob goes around taking a poll on who thinks i've been a bitch during the last 2 months) IG 88a20 00(ryan): id say bitchier bigfrank116: yeah  bigfrank116: definately bigfrank116: theres no question at all  bigfrank116: she has seemed to get a bigger head  bigfrank116: and it keeps getting bigger and bigger   fuck all of them, thats all i have to say. maybe i have become a bitch cause i'm sick of all my so-called friends treating me like shit! monica also pointed it out to me.  okay so today we're all going to see farenheit 9/11, steven forgets to buy a ticket for streb and decides to go strate to me and try to replace me with streb. what the fuck why am i the first choice for a person to get rid of? i'm sick of all theses bastards that i call friends.

      so if i stuck with blogger for a while i would have written about my sunday. which can be read in my xanga site. umm i talked to a friend of marks online last night and he made me realize something~~~i was very drunk and dont remember much at all from sunday night. hehe. well maybe not "hehe" cause its weird how a lot of stuff happend but i only remember a select few parts of it. oh man.....  well anyway. yesterday was spent with lani and karina. it was a delicious girls night out. we went to woodfield and i went shopping crazzy. came with like $170 and left with...100? maybe less i forgot to count. well at one point hank, frank, and ryan joined up with us and we all decided that we want rape whistles. so me and lani drive up to the sleepy hollow police station and ask the officer for the whistles lol it was like 9:00pm. so we're there making up an excuse for why we want the whistles...."we are going to chicago and we are scared so we want the whistles"  so instead of giving us whistles we get a speech about safety in the big city. then later me and lani went to her moms and i helped her dye her hair. then on thursday me, steff, and lani are going to get our hair done all together. i'm getting tiny dark brown streaks.

      sitting at home eating hersheys kisses. feeling a bit sick from too much chocolate yet i continue to eat.  note to self: have low expectations i really cant make plans at all cause somehow things will always turn out differently than expected. as of now my plans for tonight are to wait for marks call, have his mother pick me up and together we shall go to hectors surprise birthday party which none of his friends managed to show up to. so i guess karina's inviting all of her friends instead. i dont really like hector but hey, there will be food and cake and i havnt eaten all day so some good will come out of it.  i had an interesting morning. karina kidnapped me from my bed, forcing me to go store-hopping with the many mexicans. later i sat in a tanning salon while lani and karina layed in a box full of cancerous light. ::sizzle::  bored off my ass...i really want to get out of this house and/or be around people cause alone is not what i want today. come on cell phone! RING! pleaassssssssseeee!!

      oh baby i am free. and today is going to be a great day. karina is coming over  for sure  to finish the pinata then later we are going to woodfield mall. and hopefully i will see mark today.  then theres tomorrow. karinas brother and sister are having a birthday party so theres going to be like 20 crazzy little mexican children running around so i'm going to drop by and make sure karinas handling the kids alright...not that i can help her out, but i thought she might like some company. but most likely i'll just run away from karina and the mexicans to see *mark* since he lives down the street.

      everything that i was looking forward to for today went down the drain. this is what i get for having hopes...the bitch at jewel lied to me about when i'd get my pictures and karina never showed up. i am a complete bitch today. my dad wont stop talking to me...(i dont like to talk with my dad) he now loves it when i'm grounded cause it gives him more time with me. he has nothing to do in the world cause he's jobless all summer. now hes going to take every chance possible to ground me.  i cant wait until tomorrow. life will be significantly better as of friday. mark comes back, lori is off grounding, loris pictures come in for sure tomorrow, and i dont know what else but i am damn excited to get out of this house. i have grown to hate myself over the last few days...ick...me yuck! so i have a strong desire to go on a shopping spree and change all of my clothes and try to work from the outside in. yup--then i want to go to the beauty school and get my hair highlighted with dark dark brown. the guys were ass holes today and wouldnt leave lani and frank alone to have their "fun" so they decide to steal their shoes..?? yea i guess stealing shoes is the cool thing to do these days, along with cheating on ur girlfriend and who knows what else.  I NEED OUT OF THIS HELL HOLE!!! JEEEESUS I'M SUCH A BITCH THIS WEEK.

      today was a lot easier than my other two grounding days. i actually had stuff to do. this morning  monica dropped off her kitten which i got to play with all day. fun times. then i went to the dentist and got my teeth cleaned. (ooo the freshness!!) then my parents left gambling and while they were gone karina came and saved me!! hurray, we drove the meijer and jewel and got back home before my parents noticed that anything happened. once at my house we worked together to build a pinata for her little sisters b-day party this weekend. i miss mark, i really miss him cause hes away to wisconsin for the week and wont come home till friday. luckily i am off grounding on friday. i also miss everyone else. being stuck inside is no fun!! unless u have a cute kitten to play with. :-D

      last night i was home alone between 7 and 9:00pm. and when i'm bored i feel like doing something to liven things up. my choice: drinking wheee! so i get out my moms red whine and drink...i dont know how much but a lot was consumed cause i just chugged and to my knowledge whine contains a pretty good sum of alcohol. well i wanted more stuff to make me actually feel it so i got out some liquor and drank a lot of that too... and by the time i was done i was sooooo dizzy!!! my parents came home at 9:30 or something so i went to my room and just kinda walked around in circles but it was the most fun ever cause i was falling all over the place and getting back up then falling again. and i tried to walk in a strate line and it was not possible! eventually i layed down and fell asleep and now i am on day 2 of my grounding.  i woke up and looked at myself and noticed that i am really skinny. i weighed myself and i am now 109. !!! i used to be 113 or around there and a couple pounds is a lot to little lori. so i made spaghetti. while the rest of the world is going anti-carb i am going carb crazy today. i told my dad my plan to eat till i am 120 pounds cause that is my goal-weight. ok--so then i vacuumed the 1st floor for 5 dollars and it is now close to 3:30 and i have nothing to do for the rest of the day.

      day 1 of 5 grounding days...only 3:00 pm!! i'm unclean and greasy-haired without a care in the world! i called paulina last weekend and left a message and no call back! i am going through a paulina withdrawl thing...because i am missing her so much right now!! once i am off grounding i think it would be fun to spend an entire day with paulina, mel, and sean. too bad sean and mel dont get along anymore so we will have to compromise in some way. but if ur reading this paulina--tell me what u think of my idea!! only june 14th...i really cant wait until july comes. that will be the best month of summer. we have 4th of july festivities...july 9th is my birthday which means lazer tag fun!!! list of people invited so far ( this list may add more in the future) lani, karina, steffanie, mark, frank, hank, ryan, steve, bob, paulina, sean...i dont know who else at the moment but i am so excited for it!! and july 10th is scheflo playing at the metro. i probably wont end up going but who knows.  so i've been thinking a lot lately about everything. and this is why i hate time to myself because i think too much. but i'm sad cause i spend so much time with my senior friends and not enough time with my sophomore friends. so this is why i need to keep in touch with people cause i love my sophomore friends and i need them to live!!!

      the last couple of days have been quite interesting.. saturday i spent most of the day to myself but hurrah! stefanie came over to spend some time together just me and her. it was lots of fun. she spent the night.....bleep...blop...bleeee.....i woke up and more...wooop!....and sunday was really cool! it was mikes graduation party and everyone was there. mark came and got intimate with gaylen...it was--odd. hmmm...i laughed a lot and was very very happy throughout the day. the bands played and were awesome.. my mom drank a little too much and danced to consolation prize. later on all the girls got into karinas truck and drove off...(me, monica, karina, lani, and stefanie.) it was loads of fun we went to a park and lani showed us her gymnastics skills and we all tried to mimic her but failed horribly. i think hanging out with all of the was one of the best parts of my day. then theres today and my dad found out that i went through his shit...found his stoner smoking pipe so he got angry....grounded me until friday.i guess he didnt want me to know about his past. its sad. well time to myself means 5 days of housework. but it all may turn out well. i have a to do list for the next 5 days... ~ clean my room till its spotless ~ make some money by doing some cleaning around the house. ~ buy some much waned CD's from best buy if i ever manage to get out of the house. ~ stop somewhere and get morning glory seeds and do it the right way *wink wink* steff! ~ several loads of laundry ~ keep in touch with people...several phone calls need to be made.  oh last night was also very interesting...steven wakes me up at 2am and asks me to "babysit" him while he smokes salvia...which i guess is similar to shrooms. so i get to sit around while he smokes...it didnt really work. good thing too cause i was sleepy and still dizzy from saturday.

Steff was sopposed to call me after work but i never got the call. i wanted her to come see it with us cause i want to have time with steff just me and her cause i dont want to let mark get in between us. i want to keep all my friends and i'm not going to lose steff!! i wont let it happen!

      blah....today was an okay day. i was with karina, hank, frank, and lani. we all drove to the scheflo show in lanis car and i really wanted to take mark too because we had plans to hang out today but there wasnt enough room...he didnt miss much though cause when we got there scheflo had already finished playing and it wasnt worth 12 dollars to see the other stuff so we left. hank was being an ass to me-making fun of me-and he beat me up in the back of lanis car until i cried. and now i have bruises all over my arms and legs and he cut me with his knife twice today.  this sunday is mikes graduation party. consolation prize and against the rest are playing. it will be so much fun. but sad cause its sopposed to rain on sunday. i hope it wont cause i'm really excited for it.  so a couple weeks ago i was so happy that i thought i was going to explode and now i'm all sadd again sort of and i dont know why but i am.  the drama is coming soon!!! so theres this timeline post that i made a couple months ago in my blog. its like a timeline that showes the past and predicts the future. it hasnt failed me yet and a new event on this timeline is going to take place...hehehe

      last night...or this morning was soo much fun!! i went outside to meet up with steff. i see her car drive up but shes not driving it, shandi was. once i get in steff was so crazy-happy to see me. also verrrry drunk. that is why shandi was driving but she was good at it so it was all ok. at steak and shake we sat down for our food and steff was talking soooo loud! and shes like yelling "soup soup soup what kind of soup do they have?!" and all the other 4 am customers were staring at us.  after that we all decided to go walk around in meijer but that wasnt much fun. then it was getting kinda early so shandi drove me home just on time. cause when i was back in my room the time was 6:15 or something and my dzaidzu woke up thinking i had school today so he knocked on my door and luckily i was home to respond to him. crazzzy old people forget everything. but oh well. i am so happy, my first day of summer was  amazing!

      todays activities were so much fun with the schmidt family. last night steff slept over at my house so that in the morning her mom, mark, and ana could pick us up for chicago. i was so happy cause mark showered for us, and i made my hair look new and different for him!  at the institute i got to hold hands with mark while we walked around and i loved it 'cause it had only been like 1 day for us going out and i was already so comfortable with him. me and steff went crazy-happy to see our future college. their mom is so nice and went picture-crazy. then after the institute we walked over to some food area to eat lunch. me, steff, and mark had chinese food. it was yummy--the chicken was excellent but steff complined about gross fat in it but i didnt care i just ate whatever was on it.  it was so funny because a homeless man wanted money but all mark had was leftover chinese. he offered it to the man but i guess he didnt want that. (ungrateful bastard.) he also comnplained when their uncle didnt give him enough cash. so back we went to the house. steff took a shower while me and mark layed down on the bed and looked through his guitar center magazine. i really wanted to just kiss him right there cause it seemed like the right time to do it but me being the nervous little girl that i am, i didnt. i want to kiss him so much but i need to find the right moment to do it. oh baby i am in deep like.

      the last 2 weeks of my life have been wonderful, but i guess i was just putting aside all of my little angers toward everyone and today karina-frank-bob made me soo pissed off that everything came out...on karinas neck. yeah strangling her was fun and usually i am just kidding around but this time was a little scary cause i kinda really wanted to hurt her! but we made up and i chased her down till i was able to get a make-up hug out of her. i can never hate my mexican.

      A lot of people are bringing up this subject to me so i am going to get everything out to avoid misunderstandings.............. so before i dated jeremy he was good friends with Steve. everyone thought he came over all the time for me rather than steve so there was a ton of anti-jeremy feelings and once we went out he completely threw steve to the side and went for me... well i dont want to do that to happen between me and steff if i ever end up going out with mark. I am not using steff to get closer to mark because i love steff and if mark asked me out i would continue to see her because i love her friendship that much. and if mark didnt ask me out i still would want to see her all the time.. what happens between me and mark shouldnt effect me and steff at all.. i dont want it too cause shes my best friend! and i want to be friends with her forever and go to college with her like we planned out the other day and live together and our children will go to school together!!! oh i love steff!

I'm never happy ALL the time and here i am...really really happy with everything in my life all at once! there is nothing going wrong! i am happy with all the great friends i have..Steff, Lani, Karina, Paulina, and so on...  however...it seems that my friends are having little crisises...something going on with paulina and poor steff needs a man!!  Steff: we shall go man hunting and find a good guy, one that is good for u cause u deserve someone great!~~LORI~~

      never a dull moment in this girls life. I actually want a day to myself and it never seems to happen cause people are always asking to do something. Todays activities: baking with Alex. so i rode the bus home with karina and sat in the back with mark and ryan. they got off together to go purchase cigarettes.....:sad face: and i went to karinas house. we took her truck and drove to alex's house to bake some food for their black and white class...a black and white cake! go figure. then some other stuff for her excel class, however we arent really good cooks and all the cookies were bad. but alex's house was fun and sooo far away from crown i cant believe he goes to school that far away from his house. now i am sitting around the house being lazy..i really want food. where is the god damn food!?!?!?!?!

      Fun times after school. Ride the bus home with Karina. At her house we sat around...ate maccaroni and cheese and did our art homework and i did some drawings for her too. then we walked over to stefanies where mark had just woken up from an after-school nap. into stefanies room where we sat around~steff was cleaning out her closet and be-ridding herself of unwanted clothes in which me and karina were trying on in front of markk...i think he was having a wonderful day.. haha then we had to go back home...karina did laundry and i talked to Hector for a while. then lani called and invited me to go eat some spaghetti with her daddy so i went over there...now i am home and crazzy stuff in my life continues to occur. like all those who wear tight pants either like me for who i am...or (as lani said) they all think i am easy because  of the charles incident and want a hot piece of this ass... or according to frank...the tight pants holds their stuff too close to themselves and it brings out the horney in them...either way i dont care cause mark is all i want i will not make the same mistake again!!!

      oh my day was so great...full of paulina and food. haha, well it started out with me going home with paulina and patricia after school. we went to the mall, i got yummy cinnabon and i visited gamestop to see old faces like ken and kristin. i talked to them for a little and then it was back to paulinas where alex was awaiting us with the kittens! woo! so me and paulina ate some fun polish-made food and we did our history homework.  Then off we went on our walking adventure! we walked from paulinas, down to the river, to max's house and then to the texan BBQ where we sat down for some yummy curly fries. Then on our way back we ran into tim...walked with him for a while. Jeremy#2 happened to drive by in his fucked up red car and laugh at me and paulina skipping together. then we walked back to max's house...he wasnt home yet so we kinda stood on his driveway till he got home. we went on a mad rampage through his sketchbook then ran back home cause my dad was on his way and we managed to get home in 10 mins... ***WHOOOOOSH***what an awesome day. I love you paulina!!!~~LORI~~ oh damn...oh man...i ran...to anafganistan!! i'm so tired now!

      Today was very uneventful. I woke up--didnt bother showering, did 2 loads of laundry. cleaned and vacuumed my room. went to lani's and fed the kitties and picked up shit. the kitties love turkey and gravy so i made that my post title. i got bored and took a ton of pictures of myself on the digital camara so sometime in the future i'll have a few pictures to post on here. a ton of people came over today. hank came! . . . . . dont u hate it how u miss someone and u know they didnt miss you too?? haha. well anyway! i talked to karina today which made me happy. cause even if she's gone for 2 weeks i can still talk to her. she said its surrounded by mountains and that shes lonely and wants me to come....if i could i would! and theres tons of sexy guys .... Karina!!! go for them and u wont be so lonely anymore !!!  i also talked to Lani today. we made plans to see the villiage! yay for that movie.

      i'm not the onely one who's been bored lately. monica typed some&nbsp;crazzy stories in her blog while i'm here typing the nutrition facts of my icecream.   well today mel is coming over which is good cause i havnt seen her in a while. i was with karina yesterday and i wont see her again until 7 on thursday which is her birthday. then shes leaving me for 2 weeks starting friday. which will leave me with an emotional lani. But thats a good thing&nbsp; cause i havnt really been able to hang out with lani [just me and her] for a looong time. and this weekend frank is also leaving! but he's going to be on a cruise....lucky biotch.   bob has been pissing me off lately. me frank and karina were in my basement just sitting around watching tv when bob comes a knocking at our window. i go upstairs to let him in and he's walking away from my house....he says he cant come in cause steve's not home....okay i've been hanging out with him since we were kids and all that time&nbsp;he's only been steven's friend??? god dammit he's a complete asshole to me ALL THE TIME and i still manage to think he's an awesome person and i still want to be his friend. but nooo i must have done something to him or maybe me being alive pisses him off.&nbsp; seriously i think something is wrong with that boy he can only be friends with the "cool" people cause now that he's met scheflo his standards are too high and hey i must not be good enough for him??? i dont know whats wrong with me that bob hates me so much but meh....one day i'm going to freak out on him and it will be fun to say everything that needs to be said. ya he'll probably get pissy though.   isnt it funny how one little thing like bob not wanting to come into my house can spart so much negative emotion? yay for me blowing things way out of proportion.

      aka: paulina and matt....hehe. i am excited for today and hanging out with them. paulina you complete me!!! and as sean would say...we are two boobs on the same chest!      well well well i need to go feed some babies over at lani's house. and by babies i mean kitties. i really wish i could wake up earlier. lately my wake up time&nbsp;has been around 1 or later.&nbsp; seeing monicas freshly painted room makes me want to go paint my room. i was thinking brown and blue. i thought it would look fun. i asked my dad about it this morning and he got angry and said i would mess up/it was too much work for me! that jerk i painted karinas room and did a good job with the exception of the ceiling. but i dont want to paint my ceiling anyway!   i went over to stefanie's house last night. they have an interesting family. it kind of makes me sad cause their mom wont let her kids dress how they want to or wear their hair how they want to. example...steffs bangs and marks hair wasnt combed i guess....steff u must REBEL!!!       where has my karina gone to?? oh this is a&nbsp; sad sad week. hank is on vacation and so is joe which is making steff crazy! its so cute how much she misses him! and lani is at cedar point. monica bob and i dont know who else are at my chemical romance concert in indiana that i was sadly not invited to...poopies...hmmm karina should be around but shes not and i havnt heard from her since her unpleasantness online. i think its all over! come out karina wherever you are! i really want steff to spend the night but i dont think her mom will let her.....   random comment: i hate song lyrics in peoples blogs!!

      the last few days have been hectic but hopefully things will be getting better soon. i love how i could never stay mad at any of my friends. oh lani is leaving tonight and wont be home till fri. night/saturday. i will be watching her kitties while shes away. haha&nbsp;i am getting paid in&nbsp;icecream. well i'm beginning to realize blogs are stupid. or they're just stupid when people write offending comments. but opinions are opinoins right?  i dont know, but i was reading a post in karinas blog and its a conversation with her and ryan - and ryan said something like..."blahblah.... u broke up with me" and this will be my last opinoin to be posted on the whole situation but i think the whole ryan-karina breaking up thing is so stupid. its like ryan broke up and went back out with her so many times and when karina finally does the breaking up--all hell breaks loose! i just thought it was weird.   well hopefully there will be no more said on this topic. i should have stayed&nbsp;out in the first place. but ya that anonymous comment was just stupid.&nbsp;yes i lied to a couple people about it and i'm sorry. the whole thing was&nbsp; karinas opinoins...but she didnt want to put them on her blog cause she didnt want people to know they were her thoughts. so i was like "hey i'll help u out" so we made our comment&nbsp;TOGETHER. but when things got out of hand i guess she wanted to put the responsibility of that comment on someone else....sadly karina blamed it all on me.&nbsp;but i&nbsp;just wanted to clear that up now. it was both of us typing that comment and the first sentence of it was mine.&nbsp;the others were karinas.....woo there!     anyway! i stayed up super late last night. i didnt sleep till 5am and i woke up at 3 today. i think i will be seeing steff today which will make me happy cause when it comes to steff there is NO DRAMA! yay and that makes me happy so spending time with her will feel good.. i love that sexxy woman!

      yep today was fun times for me. i spend almost all of it with monica. we went to quiznos and then job hunting then drawing random people at the mall. i got a sexy journal and i might actually begin to write in it...even tho blogs are so much faster. i think i need some private thoughts rather than public. then later on in the day lani and karina showed up--we played volleyball and eventually all met up at the algonquin founders day where i saw so many people. practically my entire biology class was there and i got so many hugs i felt special today. and charles was there too! it was good to see him again.  oh wow we went on the gravatron and stayed in there for 15 mins. my brain hurts a little.&nbsp;and &nbsp;my tum tum. i saw joe murray....::gasp:: the sexyness of that boy is overwhealming. i havnt seen mike in&nbsp;a while...maybe he gave up on me??? i dont know. and all the guys from my biology class are damn hot. yay for being single and being able to like a million guys at once! haha i got assulted by john webster. he gave me a hug and tapped my ass while doing it! but i guess i cant&nbsp;call it assult cause i didnt mind. lol i'm one sick bitch! i miss school and seeing all my school friends. and hearing [junior] sean yell "charles!" from across the room. and all the tight pants kids and just everyone! i love sexies i want more!

      the only ex-boyfriend i can still handle talking to is charles. lol i love that boy. and one day me and steff will dedicate a day to him. woohoo!!!  well today has not been eventful. i feel like a bitch for not being at the show. to mike especially cause i said i'd be there. but somehow everyone of my friends is gone and its sad. i dont want to pay 5 bucks to go to a show by myself. i depend too much on my friends. well--i talked to monica a lot last night. it was fun and we're going to spend a day together to get to know eachother which we havnt yet gotten the chance to do. so that should be fun. in my boredom today i attempted to re-arrange/clean my room but neither has been accomplished and theres stuff all over the floor. maybe i'll go finish leftover chicken from olive garden. and do that much needed cleaning.  karina-hank....thats cute. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

       Today seems to be the day to be an asshole to lori. oh wait thats every day! lets see...bob is a fucker. he bitched at me for where i bought my t-shirt. oh my god bob--i know your scheflos bitch but i think they can get along without the profits of one t-shirt.&nbsp;u shouldnt even care about that&nbsp;anyway. ur not part of that band&nbsp;no matter how much u love them. so stop worrying about their profits. i'm sure they will get along&nbsp;fine without an extra 17 dollars.&nbsp; lets see.... oops i landed on the edge of your guitar case. somehow that managed to fuck up the whole guitar? i think not. if anything did&nbsp;happen>>>wow maybe a single string was out of tune. big deal. get over it u fucking drama queen.i'm sure its&nbsp;fixable anyway.  &nbsp;i didnt purposely go out and try to ruin ur guitar. it was a fucking mistake i'm sorry. but i didnt just jump on ur guitar. frank knocked me into it. not that it matters cause frank is ur friend and i am not i guess. u can yell at me all the fuck u want. but i am NEVER mean to u! stop being such an asshole. with all that said...if this manages to get to bob let me apologize. u dont deserve this apology but this is just an angry lori typing at the moment...not that it matters u'll be angry at me for something new tomorrow.

      why dont the guys understand anything about me? hank especially. he always tells me that i was so much cooler last summer. he doesnt realize how angry that makes me. i like myself so much better now than i did then. hell--last summer i had one friend--ashley. since she was always gone i spent my days locked inside my room. only to come out when the guys would come over. and even then we'd only play video games in my basement. if they left the house i wouldnt follow. i'd retreat back into my room hoping for them to come in again. and my sad depressed self would sit next to my window for hours just staring at the world. i did that EVERY NIGHT!&nbsp;  hank doesnt know anything.&nbsp; i hated my life before&nbsp;--- he doesnt know what its like to truely be alone. i went so long without a single friend. without a place to be happy and laugh and be myself.  i can honestly be my true self with paulina cause no matter what i say or how i act i know&nbsp;i&nbsp;wont&nbsp;be made&nbsp;fun of&nbsp;by her. i know that our group jokes around with me, but hey i finally&nbsp;found people&nbsp;to be my&nbsp;friends who would make me happy and getting made&nbsp;fun&nbsp;of is the last thing i want.&nbsp; they dont see it but it effects me alot more than they think. even if i walk&nbsp;away laughing at&nbsp;what they said--in the end, -i&nbsp;hate myself inside.&nbsp;

        Happy Birthday frank!  woah i just went photo-posting crazzy on my blog.  anyway..my day was great. karina and hank came over earlier in the day. we sat around and talked. then frank and lani came over and with that we played suck and blow but i couldnt stop laughing at the thought of being so close to lani's face. hehehe. well sadly i left frank on his birthday but he didnt seem to mind. they all went swimming in the quarrey while matt and paulina picked me up. we drove all over the place. to the mall, the thrift store, an awesome place called...record breakers??? i think that was it. then to steak and shake&nbsp;and finally&nbsp;to paulinas to watch the texas chain saw massacre. which is some scary stuff. on the way home we played 'sex' which is somewhat like pididdle. and i lost so badly. my shoes-socks-sweater-and shirt had to come off. thats how badly i lost. i love paulina cause when i'm with her i laugh so much. and i can act stupid around her cause she wont make fun of me for it. i love her so much! 2 second sex was the best!

      those assholes kept calling me this morining. the people who want to sell me insurance and free trips to florida and all that other bullshit. i had fun talking to them in my 'just woke up' voice. which sounds somewhat like a drunken old&nbsp;man. and then lani calls me--so i decided that more people would most likely end up calling so i got up and took a shower. i am out of conditioner but theres like 10 bottles of shampoo sitting around my bathroom. who buys the shampoo without the conditioner?? so i've been spending a lot of time reading miles' blog which is amazingly interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Life and Love and Why  when i talked to lani she said that paulina wanted to hang out today so i called her and left another one of my strange messages--where i ramble on about nothing important. so maybe i'll get to see her today cause that would make me verry happy.  i have a strange sudden urge to buy sweaters.

       I went crazy on lani today in A&amp;W/KFC. Being made fun of makes you crazzy--now i know what its like to be a loser, like those psychotic serial killers.   A COLLECTION OF RANDOM THOUGHTS  Hank: I care because you're one of us am I really? cause&nbsp;to me i am the outcast of the group-the one that really shouldnt be around cause hey, i'm an idiot...i'm steve's little sister and a sophomore. no one wants that around. thinking makes me angry... "i dont think you are considered a virgin you fucked yourself so many times"--the words of sean. thats us talking about me and how i like people for no particular reason....my mind is cloudy and it hurts. Lani: good guys would wait&nbsp;a while to stick their tongues down ur throat...not these recent ones that do it in the first 2 hours... Lori: ya like mark>? it took him 5 days to kiss me and even longer to make out....look what happend with that one.  nathan said some nice stuff to me...nice/mean....stuff like..i can do better and i'm an amazing girl. yay for self esteem!!

       WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT.... my eyes? my hair? my laugh? my personality? my sense of humor? my style? my taste of music?  WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF......... i said hi? i told you a secret? i asked you to hangout? i held your hand? i died? i killed someone? i wrote a song about you? i asked you for help? i needed a shoulder to cry on?  DO YOU THINK I'M... a good person? trustworthy? a good friend? someone fun to be around? good at giving hugs? a good musician? selfish?  an asshole? loving? funny?

      thursday morning we are leaving for the dells. i'm really excited. me-karina-hank-bob and my brother of course are all going. it should be fun. we're staying at treasure island in one really big room and theres a huge outdoor waterpark and an indoor water park too. then theres big cheif carts and coasters right next door! and theres a large amount of HOT TUBS all over treasure island so that should also be fun.  damn all the guys are going to make fun of my skanky swim suit.... well the guys said that they are bringing alcohol for the night and that makes me want to bring some fun too. but knowing that my parents will be there i think i'll save it for the future.  we're coming back on friday and we all have to leave early cause bob has a show that night plus i told mike i'd be there to see ATR play.  the show is this friday at elgin academy. consolation prize, against the rest, self control, SCHEFLO!!, and royale with cheese are playing. i'm excited for this week.

      One day as a small opening appeared on a cocoon, a man sat for several hours watching the butterfly struggle to force its body through that little hole. Then it seemed to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could and it could go no further. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then emerged easily, but it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings. The wings would enlarge and expand to be able to support the body, which would contract in time.  Neither happened. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a swollen body and shriveled wings. It never was able to fly. What the man, in his kindness and haste, did not understand was that the restricting cocoon and the struggle required for the butterfly to get through the tiny opening was nature's way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings. Then the butterfly would be ready for flight once it achieved its freedom from the cocoon. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If we were allowed to go through our life without any obstacles, it would cripple us. We would not be as strong as what we could be. We could never fly.

      its really sad when all ur friends are involved with their cute couples and ur the one whos alone...damn them all! i'm so lonely.  i saw mark several times today cause i've been with steff. its really sad to be seeing him all the time. i mean--i like seeing him cause i still like him and all but it makes me really sad. and even worse, pictures from a while ago were developed and on their fridge i see the cutest picture of me and mark holding hands on a bench at the art institute with stefanie and ana on either side of us. such wonderful happy memories that i cant stand to remember.  well today was a really good day. karina woke me in the middle of a crazy dream this morning. steven and streb were playing haunted house with me and were chasing me with knives. and for some odd reason my hair was blonde....anyway...me and karina went to ikea together and bought her a rug for her room. i payed 40 dollars of it and if i dont get it back well unfortunate events may occur. then we went into woodfield and i bought some clothes. we drove back home and i went to steffs house. mark has the bitch stick up his ass or something cause hes changing in a bad way. what happend to him? hes gone somewhere. get the hell back we want our old lives back!

      it was the most amazing movie i've ever seen. it made me realize so many things. like how one event or choice u make can change the outcome of your entire life. it made me soo damn sad cause it got me thinking too much about mark. like if certain things didnt happen how different would my life have turned out?   I CANT GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD~! well this trying to get over mark thing is not working. i cant stop thinking about him and i love everything about him. he is everything that i would have wanted in a boyfriend. (some exceptions on his actions) but everything about him is perfect! he makes me laugh, he is sweet, shy, cute. he is  everything ! plus my family loves his polishness and unlike my last 2 boyfriends my friends approoved of me going out with him. i was able to hang out with him and my group and everyone was friends and would have a good time. hes tall and amazing and i miss him and no matter how much i should hate him for what he did i dont because i loved having him as my boyfriend.  and i wonder how different things would have been for both of us if we had stayed together...i wish i could find out but i cant and i wont.

      happens to be my birthday. the plans have changed a little. celebration is on friday rather than thursday. the first half of the day is invitation only and at night there will be a bon fire for all to come to. THE PLANS in the morning just a few of us are going to see anchor man which comes out friday...then around 5:00 steven comes home from work and that would be a good time to arrive at my house. earlier if possible. we are leaving for lazer tag around 5:30. rides will be provided by my dad and brother or whoever else drives their car to my house. (LANI and/or KARINA) after lazer tag comes the bonfire in my backyard which everyone will be invited to. its for my birthday and the pre-metro get together. cause the scheflo show at the metro is saturday. woo! here are directions to my house for those who havnt been here before.  from rt72...driving past best buy and target turn on LOCUST (the road in between target and homemakers) go straight on locust for a while, up the hill--you will pass by some appartments on the right hand side, then make a right turn on SURREY LN.  go straight for a while then make a right turn into KARYN CT> it will be the 2nd court on the right. my house is the big rectangle in the very center of the court. it has a big pine tree in the front yard and will most likely have several cars in the driveway.  there--did i put enough detail into it?? contact me at 847.476.6006 to tell me if you're coming so we can see how many cars we will be needing and so on.

      yesterday was so-so. I got a ride home from stefanies mom. we were discussing this movie about drugs when her mom says "how could these parents not notice their own children doing drugs?!?!" so then i sat at home and obsessively wrote in my blog...their so fucking addicting! eventually i got the ride i needed to karinas house to help her paint however i was late and she had already painted 2 walls so i helped her finish the rest. 2 blue walls, 2 gray walls, green ceiling. i entertained myself by sniffing the walls, paint cans, and brushes. i'm a loser. it did nothing for me. eventually lani picked us up for steak with her dad. too much flavor! ........... now i am sitting at home 8:00am cause we are all going out to eat at the manor and karinas taking sam which makes hank want to kill. i have 45 mins to get ready. ppft. stupid sam...i wonder what he'll make fun of me for today?

      4th of july was for the most part wonderful. it was girls DAY out at lanis house with me-lani-karina-steff. we all made pretty bracelets together and made cake and blew up balloons and ate our hearts away on her dads icecream...or at lease i did. i think i'm afraid to go into stefanie's livejournal again cause theres 22 enraging comments and everyone is mean to eachother over there. its scary. not once have i been in a fight with any of my current friends. theres occational bitchyness but no pissy fights and thats why i am a happy lady. check out the madness in my links section~~~~~~~~>>>> well i got a call from ryan walter last night at 1 am. odd. he wanted hectors number. i think he wanted drugs from him or something. meh.  today is a day for painting excitement at karina's house. i cant wait for the TOXIC fumes!

      "What a fucking asshole!  Who you ask ... MARK!  That's right ... FUCKING ASSHOLE!  He deserves to rot in fucking hell for what he did.  Lori is such a good person, and then he goes and does something stupid like that!  He will NEVER find another girl as great as her!  She liked him for him, ... she loved his tight pants, goofy sense of humor, and his fluffy bird hair.  NEVER will he find a girl that cared for him as much as her!  I can't believe it!  I'm so sorry that Lori ever wasted her time with him!  He is a pig!  And he lied to me!!  ME, of all people!  Me and Mark were so close, we told each other everything, he was my  best friend!  And then he pulls a fucking stunt like this!  It's over!!  He has lost all the trust and respect I ever had for him!  He knows that if he would have told me the truth in the first place I would have tried to help him find an easier way to deal with it, I'm here to help!  But NOOOO, lets fucking brag about it to all of Lori's friends.  "It was worth it!!"  Well, I'm glad it was worth it because not only did you lose Lori as a girlfriend but you lost our relationship!  Not that it means anything to you because you obviously don't care about anyone but yourself!  Oh yeah, and Ryan!!  You're his fucking bitch and its DISGUSTING!  You are almost 16 years old, GROW UP!  Be your own person!  You don't need to be who Ryan wants you to be!!  Ryan is not going to be around forever, I AM!  So maybe, just maybe listen to what I have to say once in awhile!!  GRR!  And I defended him!!  I yelled at Lori so much, I was on the verge of kicking her ass for saying those things about Mark!!  This is like a slap in the face!  "Thanks Stefanie for defending me, but oops ... I did sleep with that SLUT Morgan!"  So many fucking lies!  First it's "I didn't cheat on her at all, I don't know where anyone got that idea!"  Then it's "It was just a joke so she would break up with me!"  Now it's "Yes, I did cheat on her!  But only because I was SO fucked up!"  Well, that is SO fucking not an excuse!  I can't believe it!  I mean like deep down I knew it was true, but I tried believe him ... because Mark is a good person!  Mark blushes at everything, he wouldn't even kiss Lori for the first week they were going out!!  But then he gets around Ryan and EVERYTHING changes!  He has to be a  hardass!!  Well guess what Mark, that isn't you!!  The Mark that everyone knows and LOVES does NOT have sex, is NOT a racist bitch, and does NOT fucking lie and cheat on people!"

      and it rained on bob's show. it was depressing but i love the feeling of rain in my hair so that was nice. i saw charles for the first time since school and it made me happy, he makes me laugh.  ...i also spent the day with mark or at least most of it..it was awkward and made me really sad. cause when hes not around ryan walter or whoever, he is himself and he doesnt do things to make other people happy. he is cute and nice and everything that i like and i couldnt stand to be hanging out with him cause it just makes me like him all over again. even after what he did which...by the way was true and he was very proud of himself for it--cause guys in my grade are fuckups who think they are badasses if they can have sex with random people.  well i am happy because steff now knows the truth and i dont know, its just a relief that she knows.  so for the past week i've been feeling like shit and havnt been able to feel happy. but theres a way to fix that...medicated happiness. i have some and i dont know yet if i want it or not but right about now its looking like a good idea.

        -Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't care about presents or about going to fancy placed. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend.

      Don't tell me to trust your words if you're telling a lie.  I've been lied to for the past week...and i heard the truth from my very good friends hank and frank. so sad that i had to be lied to all this time. ummm i'm not trying to make anyone of my friends seem like a bad person because i love all of my friends and i would never be mad at them no matter what. even if this is a good reason to be angry, i will just let it go because family is more important than friends--i can understand that...  i just have a few more words to say on this issue... lets play a guessing game to see who said these words>> "it was worth it" hmm what could have been worth it and who would have said this?

      i spent the day with karina yesterday. it was interesting. we went to sears and sherwin williams to look for paint samples cause next week we are going to paint 3 rooms in her house. then i guess her and hank are going to build some furniture for her room. in the end her room will be beautiful. well me and karina had "dinner" at wendys. if u want to say a large fries is dinner. nathan was there being himself...hmmm and we eventually ended up at best buy--where they have a home theater set up with a movie playing and two reclining seats. so we just sat and watched the first 20 minutes of 50 first dates in the middle of best buy. the guy working there was completely fine with it so we enjoyed ourselves. then we called hank and he said that he has a surprise for us. so we go to my house and steven is handcuffed to the bench press.  some other stuff happened... and i spent the rest of my night at home.

      blog comments hurt. well bob dumped me as a friend. that sucks considering i am still going to see him everywhere. suggestion....the house that steve and lori live in should be called "the piecyk house"  cause the steve lori situation seems to confuse people for some reason. . . ? ? ?  anyway that subject should just be gotten rid of.   my day was pretty good. matt, paulina, john, and kandice picked me up this morning and we all went to the pool again. it was freezing. kandice's boobs shrunk! so did the guys packages. haha. me and paulina took a shower together! woot woot! yea my day was awesome.  my mom drove me to the bank for me to get 100 from my account. i got to drive home! woot again! and i did pretty good except for me swirving into the left lane turning onto surrey.   : D    well tomorrow is when i leave for a beautiful 4 day vacation with lani. i am fucking pumped!! i am going to go crazy if i have to stay here with all the drama and agrivation. sweet sweet getaways. lucky karina and hank dont have to stay here and deal with all the shit.      dont you love running away from your problems???

      well then now that i know bob reads this i have a note for him to read.... okay i dont want to hate u and i dont want you to hate me. i really dont think i have a "negative attitude" as u said. and personally i think u are cocky too. but as a person bob i really like u. but i cant like u when ur yelling at me for EVERYTHING. as in for hanging out with stevens friends which just so happens to include u sometimes. its not my fault his friends want to be my friend too. is that so wrong??????? me and my brother have always hung out with the same people. ever since we were kids. i really dont think its going to change much. and most of the time i'm with lani or karina anyway. im not constatly around u guys. i'm around the people steven stopped being friends with....(the girls) so that comment  "haha i stole another one of your friends."  was me being sarcastic. i said it on purpose cause i was trying to piss u off cause of all the 'hanging out with stevens friends' shit u've been giving me. and since i became friends with monica...another one of his friends.....i said it. and by the way. monica is the one who suggested we hang out and i like her so there we hung out. and u guys think i'm nothing without steven. u think all my friends came from him but thats not true! i have entire different groups outside of ours. just like u have ur bands i have my other groups of friends and in case u havnt noticed i havnt been spending time with any of u. i was with my other group and guess what....u and ryan were hanging out with me and MY FRIENDS. oh my god watch out!! u hung out with my friends. BIG FUCKING DEAL i didnt care u need to stop caring too.  dont talk about me being so negative when ur negative enough to point out all the bad things i am. thanks bob. the thing about this that really pisses me off is u look at how i treat other people rather than u. before all this happend i never treated u unfairly. i never did anything at all to you.  think about it bob . ending the fucking drama already and i will too!

      tomorrow is super-fun swimming adventures!!!! yay for swimming with paulina and company.   well today was fun. i woke up from a stefanie sleepover. went online and posted like a crazy beotch. then got tired and went back to sleep waking again at 1:30. i've felt very strange all day. but i'm assuming thats just side effects. i went over to lani's house and we sat around like the lazy fucks we are.   ; )      She got sick of me....or...something....and dropped me off at the mall where i visited stefanie at her pacsun job. it looked. . . boring. but fun cause of fellow employees. i got a job application for lani...talked to the girl who works at zumiez and made a few "purchases???" at wet seal.  then i sat home for several hours watching scary movie 2 which is the best one in my opinion. then matt and paulina called....they came over with john and FUSION FRENZY!!! woot woot! we had fun times with that game....hopefully they forgot to take it home cause i could go for some 1:30am games. all of us had a blast in my basement with pillow fights and lani sitting aside watching the madness....and sleeping..    : (   then 11pm mcdonalds salad and fries!~!~!~!~!

      some people are crazy i tell you.   i was at the movies today. hanging out with steff, charles, craig, i made a new friend maya, nazi ryan walter, nathan was there and so on. we saw harold and kumar go to white castle which was hilarious. well when i got home theres a white SUV in my driveway. is it just me or does that seem odd since they broke up for the 3rd time??? umm...yea...hey i might as well go back out with jeremy. maybe things for us will be even stronger after a couple break ups. sure worked for karina!

      i swear my house is infested with flies.....scary enormus flies that dont fly away when you chase them...they fly  towards  you! meaning that trying to kill the flies in my basement is a very frightening experience. cause they'll buzz past my ear with that sound that makes me crazzy! i just  finished vacuuming the basement and i noticed that there are tons of stains all over the carpet. its kinda sick.   well my dad has been pissing me off in the same way bob has been pissing me off. and that would be giving me shit on who i'm friends with. like how i'm always with stevens group of friends. so i took like a 3 day vacation from that group of people to hang out with paulina,matt and so on. but then i get shit for that too. i dont get it....bob turns into an asshole bitching at me for hanging out with stevens friends. but when i bring a different group of people over i find bob ryan and steve hanging out with us. weird isnt it. i dont mind that they hung out with us why do they have to care when i hang out with them??? then i get shit for hanging out with steve and them cause they're older than me...well even if i go hang out with paulina shes older than hank plus theres 19 year olds with us. people need to stop worrying about who i'm hanging out with it really pisses me off.  god fucking dammit.   well this fly is giving me hassle too. it'll fly into the computer room make me chase it around the basement and when i retreat back to the computer it'll fly in and out again. its messing with me!

      i saw paulina again today! woohoo for that excitement. her and matt came to pick me up and we met up with john and candice at jesters--ate a couple hot dogs. the ride home was hilarious. *boop boop* poking matt till he went insane *boop* hes one crazzy driver! we came back to my house and watched a clockwork orange which was verry verry good. i loved it. it made me realize that british people are horney bastards...haha.  so now i'm just relaxing from the excitement.   my finger hurts like a bitch. some peely skin came off and i think theres some sort of infection cause its all red and swollen. not that any of you wanted to hear about that but its just pissing me off.

      thats what paulina is. i've spent the last 2 days with her. its been fun. there was the party at her house and lots of halo and fushion frenzy and all sorts of excitement. me and paulina enjoyed ourselves with the raping of a  large yellow duck. haha inside jokes are fun. . . . .and  i spent the night over there for the first time.  today matt and john took us to lanis house where i got her mail for her and me and paulina walked back to my house. but to get there we had to cross the creek so we built a little bridge using our spectacular teamwork skills. at my house we played more halo then we rented a clockwork orange and the butterfly effect. watching that movie always makes me kinda sad in the end. it makes me think too much about my life turned out and makes me want to go back and make little changes. just to mess around with cause and effect. i think that would be interesting.  i havnt seen steff in a long time so i  must  hang out with her soon. and i definately need to go eat food right now. cause gaining weight will never work out for me if i keep forgetting to eat.    time flies.     boys wrestle and girls make fun of eachother until they develop an eating disorder.

      dont get overly excited for anything. . . i was so pumped for having that stupid bon fire that when the time came to have it everyone left??? ....or something.. . . . . actually we still had girls night out that was lots of fun. we drove around in monicas mini-van on a condom hunt! hahahaaa at 10:30 pm. at one point ryan joined us so we're all at meijer huddled around condoms and i was the only virgin out of 6 people.  and for some reason people who've had sex are afraid to purchase condoms. LANI especially. so they all bought the "fun pack" or pleasure pack....whatever,  and in the car they fought over which ones to give eachother. it was fun to watch people get so bitchy over condoms.    earlier that day. . . . . me and lani went to chillis for some dinner. then we went to the mall and i found a new person to seduce this year. joshy josh josh...he works at zumiez now so yay if i ever need to talk to him i know where to find him. he hugged me and i was automatically reminded of karina. and this is why.  josh is so tall that when he hugs me my mouth is practically even with his nipple and i had the urge to...bite it? or....something, cause when karina hugs hank the hight proportion is the same as me and josh  and this is all pointless info but i thought karina might have fun reading it!

      one week from this wednesday my family is going on a trip to the northern woods of wisconsin. and when i say "my family" i mean mom, dad, steven. lori is not going...thank god. that place is so fucky i hate it. its 6 hours in our non-a/c van. once we're up there the activities include sitting in a boat for a few hours. fun? hell no. and last time we were there we went into town for breakfast to this little country place and we walk in...its crazy everyone at the restaurant turns silent and stares at us cause we are out of towners and they live in a place were everyone knows eachother...weird stuff. so my dad's letting me stay home while they're away! woo for that.
