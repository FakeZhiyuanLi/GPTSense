      Egotist, n. A person of low taste, more interested in himself than in me.   --Ambrose Bierce   I spent the last week with my father.  I had a great time.  It gave me a better understanding of me.  I might be disgusted at times with who conceived me, but they had a major part in my foundation, and I respect what they gave me, especially my ability to be self-sufficient and reliant.  I have two sisters.  (I am the youngest out of three daughters.)  My oldest sister and I are both strong willed and fighters; the middle child of my family has everything that we lack, and her behavior disgusts me.    For example, my father lives in Florida on the coast.  When I was on vacation, he took me to the beach everyday, and I lavished in the sun, surf, and sand.  It felt so nurturing, as if all my senses were being stimulated, yet at peace.  It is one of my "happy places."  I learned to enjoy the ocean as a child with my sister (the middle child).  She was my ocean-playmate.  As children we would spend our vacations riding waves and coughing up salt water, and no matter how powerful the previous wave had scared and frightened us, we would look forward to the next awesome natural ride.  It was one of those memorable childhood experiences that I shared with her.  When I was in Florida, I asked Dad if my sister was able to enjoy the beach when she was visiting over spring break.  He said that he took them one day, but she wouldn't go in past her knees because she had fears about sharks and the rip tide.  I was astonished.  She is a certified scuba diver.  He said that Prick (her husband), my mother (Darweenie), and Rick's mother lectured her about shark attacks and being pulled out to sea.  I laughed when my father told me this.  I found it amusing and ridiculous.  Are there more sharks?  Is the rip tide stronger?  I don't think so!  The difference is her husband.  He finds it dangerous; therefore, she finds it dangerous.  Has she forgotten her past and loves for life?  Does she have any interests that are hers or does she allow her husband to control her every move?  As time goes on, I am repulsed by her actions.  How the fuck do I have a sister such as her?    Fuk dat!  I would rather be dead than not to be able to enjoy the simple pleasure of riding a wave and crashing into sand as I cough up the unpleasant taste of salt water.  To me, it is primal and a part of me.  Where did my sister go?  Why did she hate herself enough to allow a man to take such control over her life?  I don't hate him; he is an opportunist.  I hate the way she allows him to control her every move.  Women are people the same as men.  When one person allows another person to control their happiness...I just have to say FUK DAT, and OPEN YOUR SENSES AND LIVE.    This is dedicated to women who don't have enough self-esteem to pave their own happiness, and especially for my sister who should realize from her upbringing toâ€¦   TAKE CONTROL AND REMEMBER YOU DESERVE TO ENJOY YOUR LIVE AND BE PAMPERED AS MUCH AS HIM.  IF YOU ALLOW A MAN TO TAKE AWAY YOUR IDENTITY, WHAT IS THE POINT IN LIVING.  ALL I CAN SAY TO YOU IS... FUK DAT!
