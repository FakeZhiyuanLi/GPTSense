      Everytime I see him on the Food Network, I get irritated. I shouldn't let him bother me, but it's partly his fault.   I am not referring to his appearance, even though I find his overly smug & wholesome punch-me-face so...punchable. What I talking about is his "Dennis the Menace" persona on this network. He acts like a jerk! When&nbsp;the&nbsp;co-hostess&nbsp;asks him a question that may be more for the audience than herself, he snorts with disdain. Then of course he makes an attempt to say something cutting. He repeatedly flaunts this behavior on camera, and has even given attitude to more experienced cooks. And whats with his almost ghoulish ogling at certain women? What a creepy boy. Flirting with women in the audience on camera, the oilyness & desperation he exudes is a turnoff.  He may state that he knows what he's doing, or laugh at anothers error, but I see that he not only&nbsp;constantly fumbles in the social world...but&nbsp;in the culinary world as well. He speaks with a false bravado, and makes&nbsp;quite a show&nbsp;with something most other chefs find routine.&nbsp; And all&nbsp;that noise coming out of his punch-me-face...makes me wish Tony Bourdain would just step onto the set, shove him aside and show him how its really done. With style, flavor and plenty of sarcasm!  &nbsp;

      I have developed a color coded system for when and how much the Bush administration TRIES TO BULLSHIT THE U.S.A.  Right now my alert just raised up. Yea, its pretty friggin high right now. Its lookin pretty much like bullshit.  Anyone who still can trust him and his tricky thugs may as well trust a shitty conman in a bar. The Bush administration has as much credibility as a coke sniffing street hustler.

      Only the the humorless, manipulative and the most horrible little breed of women believe this sickening lie. I love women, and with my feminist leanings, I know it rests on a womans shoulders whether or not she should terminate a pregnancy. But this isn't about that.  This is about the breed of woman who believes they can treat anyone like shit when things don't go exactly thier way. My adult sibling is this very breed. She is a rotten fucking bitch. I do her favors, and drive her everywhere. But if she happens to start off late, then she holds ME responsible for not getting her there on time. So as I drop her off, I am casually talking...but she abruptly exits and slams the door as hard as possible. And of course she never speaks a word during the whole trip there. So, I screech my tires and exit that shitty little parking lot as fast as I can, so I can catch up with my dignity. But it has long left me, whenever SHE'S around.  Ladies, if anyone of you have this problem, I urge you to seek a therapist. If not for the sake of the person whose dreams you kill daily, do it for your miserable disgusting little self. There is nothing less attractive that a hateful ogre who has no genuine sense of humor. I believe a real sense of humor must be well rounded. To laugh at the silly crap that I and others deal with, is something I do quite often. But she is that special animal that only works one way. She can poke fun of others, and thier situations. But she never can tolerate poking fun of herself. And if you talk in jest of anything regarding anything about her...she completely flips and then of course, I get to see the adult version of a baby flying into a rage filled tantrum. How charming.  Speaking of her losing her sense of humor, I have lost mine. I find little enjoyment being around her now. She is a horrible person. I find the best thing that works is to participate as little in the relationship as you possibly can. I speak very little, if at all. I make a point be be calm now, even if she stresses me out. Because when she does, she enjoys it and like that special little ill-breed of woman, she enjoys trying to make me sound like I'm the screwed up one.  So, I do not react. But if I have to...I make sure that everything I do or say is so understated that its almost non existant. I make a point now, more & more often to speak less, and more quietly. Often to the point of others having to lean over and strain to hear me. Hell, make the bitch work for you for a change.  I don't enjoy these moments either. Thier is nothing sweet or satisfying with dealing with a true blue bitch. They will always find ways to manipulate you, and certainly always find ways to make you into a fool.  Never try this kind of warfare on them. They will always win. They enjoy the pain of this gorey bloodsport. It gets them off in thier own diseased way.  The only beautiful thing about our ordeals with rabid animals such as these, is the knowledge that we will someday leave them, and soon. And they will either be left alone, or desperately seek out another who they can cling to visciously and be cruel to. For some reason, it is a kind of love to them. They can't express it in kind and intelligent ways. So they end up expressing their love by showing you such cruelty and disregard. When they hurt you, and lash out at you unprovoked with barbed comments and cutting insults, its because they love you. That special kind of love we call hate.
