      my nick is like the weirdest you have ever come across right? let me tell you why...the boys in my class, yes can be mature at times, but at one point, they like to gossip alot...like girls...gossiping for girls is like natural instinct but for boys is like a complete turn-off...especially kok wei la...don't know which teacher he learn from...hai... it's actually considered a good day if you remove kok wei from my class...my class..chaotic but nice, without noise, it will be like weird...ok...it's a nice day because i saw my crush today and i walked beside him...muahaha..no big deal but it's a big deal to me...maybe in my last entry i said that i regretted liking him...but telling the truth here, i can't forget him man...haha...guess what...i am happy...

        being able to forget someone you like, means you are mad, completely mad...it is not that easy you know? you feel like killing yourself when the ohter party just avoids you when the whole world knows that you like him...  that's for me, i can't make myself forget someone who i have liked for like half a year and he just avoids me when he knows it? stupid of me right? wrong...you try forgetting someone who you like, see how painful it is?   reasons for me to forget him: 1. the uttermost important point is because his girlfriend is my choir senior, sound daft, doesn't it, but really she is like the nicest senior ever, and i want to respect her for her choice, so it's better to give way to her..nono...it's better to forget him for her sake... 2. secondly, it's his last year in sec shool, and it won't be a clever choice to like him when he is leaving the school in like 4 months? so guess i need to refresh myself a little bit and forget man... 3. thirdly, it's because no matter how much i like him, still no hope right? 4. fourthly, did i mention my choir senior?  so that's probably all...think about it...give me comments on this...

        so after many attempts of getting happier and happier by the day, my attempt failed today...i was incredibly gloomy just because something distrubing happened during my morning walk to school...  i was taking my usual ride in 190, with my crush's so-called girlfriend inside ...no big deal right? but problem is when both os us alight the bus, she was like trying to shove me aside and walk faster, and i know that she knows about me liking her boyfriend...and this particular girl is my choir senior...how saddening...

         Today was not that good, although fruitful but not good...how do i describe it...ok...my horoscope says that there will some spat in the romantic department towards friday and today is thursday...and all of it went true...so i advise you guys to always read horoscopes from 8 days and sunday times....they are extremely dependable...  let me tell you in more details.. so i was in school, during cme period and my teacher, mrs ngoh, was not present so a relief teacher...of course everyone naturally went ecstatic and mad...sound nice to you but not me because one of my childish friend went bonkers and sent an sms to the boy i liked, saying that i like him la...not using my mobile, but my friends..then we shouted at him, and my friend, milo, went to send him another sms saying it was all a stupid joke...yah that was fine but it's just the beginning...  after school, i went to my friend's house to bake cookies for our project. Milo called this boy and talked to him, apologising and all that...how i wished i will be there listening to the conversation all by myself, eavesdropping la...then milo smsed him saying that the sms was really a joke done by my friend, monkey lor...then do you know what did he reply? he said this "it's allright, immaturity is normal"...how sarcastic ...haha...  basically that's all...is that a good thing..maybe..but the really bad thing is that i have mountains of homeworks to be completed and i haven't even started on one...die...and i have geo and science test tomorrow..how bad can life be...goodness...

        i awfully hate it when people tell me how beautiful love is and how it can make you go out of this world, why? simply because, it is not even beautiful, it is painful... teenagers go on this cycle of life that is weird...really weird...when you are in love, you feel like you are in heaven because it is your first time but i think my first time sucks a hell lot...       &nbsp;   today was seriously the most weird day in my life, i feel extremely gloomy, not like other days, where i am like so giggly that people hate me... i guess it is because of damn love... my friend told me that she saw the boy that i like going out with some other girl in orchard... i know it is hatefully selfish of me to say this, but yes, i am desperate today because of that... those of you in love will know how the feeling is to be rejected silently... guess i'm fated to be this way...       &nbsp;   our class went to it lab3 today and we happily went pass 4/5...his class... my class is like chaotic so when we walk pass, i just look ahead and pretend i didn't know he was inside... i was like so hurt to pretend that way..yah...he won't care but i care right? i got my own rights... then i realised that i forget to bring my damn dictionary for my composition exam...damn... i took the opportunity to borrow one from his class...or particularly from his friend, changxuan ... who is my cca's chairman..but unfortunately for me, he didn't have one...       &nbsp;   and tell you something, his current squeeze is my cca senior who is like the nicest senior ever...so i guess it must be more hurtful for me to undergo that kind of embarrassment...poor me..let see how tomorrow goes...
