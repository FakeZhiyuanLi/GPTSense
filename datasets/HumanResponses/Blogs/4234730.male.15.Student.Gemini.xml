						   Well right now I am about to eat (yum) so I will make this a bit shorter than normal especially becauce I had a boring day. I woke up at 6:30 am :( and I at some breakfast and started to fiddle with my computer trying to get the network/internet in our new house to work. I had to work till noon cutting up the hundreds of boxes we used to move which is ok because I love my sharp knife :P The rest of the day I spent trouble shooting my home network trying to get it working with WEP encryption which most people will not know...

						   Well today is Augest 14 and this is the first posting of my first blog ever and I will write alot everyday so check back every night for some reading if your bored! Well first let me tell you a bit about me and where I live... My name is Trevor Nederlof I'm 15 and I live in a town called Westport which is in connecticut. I have a younger brother (Andrew) who is 13 as well as a black lab (Chloe) who is 10. We just moved to a new house near a river which goes through our small sized town. I am a geek because I love computers but at the same time I have a strong love for sailing... every type of boat may it be 10-150 feet I have done it all and love every moment of it.                 Last night I saw Aliens Vs. Predator which was a great action movie and I recommend it to everyone. Then I woke up at 3am to watch my cousins boyfriend artor  row in the olympics on a 2 man boat. I was tired when I awoke at 8am I started to unpack my room and help my cousin Jake who works for my mom take alot of the boxes from our move to the dump in town. I met my best friend David Brenner  (Everyone calls him Brenner) in town and we rode on bikes back to my house where we watched Da Alie G Show which is the funniest show EVER. After Brenner left I basicly just played computer games while helping my aunt and grandmother with the boxes from the move. Well Pizza will be here soon so I should go...           Look forward everynight by 8pm est (1 am GMT) I will post on my blog and I hope you all share with others so they to can read my life lol. Until tomarrow enjoy life because you only live once :)
