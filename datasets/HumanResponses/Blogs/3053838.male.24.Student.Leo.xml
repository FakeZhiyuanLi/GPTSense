      i'm reading a devotional on the book of Romans. sigh. it's pretty hard reading coz the book seems to be speaking about me. well, basically the moral of the story is to be the light to the lost. meaning that as a christian, i should behave in a manner where my life shows Christ in me. unfortunately, my life style is definitely not like that of a christian.   i know what are the things i have to change and all but yet actually doing them is so difficult. yeah, i know the drill... i'm supposed to submit to God and let Him do the work. but that is so much easier said than done. How to submit when the current life style is so enjoyable? ok even if i put pleasure aside, it seems as if my character has taken shape and refuse to change. a couple of things i try to change all seem to be impossible.   ok. i'm not undermining the power of God. of course God could change me in a instant if He wanted to. but apparently He wants me to change out of my own free will. That is the hard part. i wish He would just make me. sigh.    Dear Heavenly Father.     &nbsp;   Thank You for Your sacrifice of love for me. Help me to love You back with all my heart. Put in me the conviction and strength to change for the glory of Your name. I place myself in Your loving hands.     &nbsp;   In Jesus' name,    Amen

      i just watched shrek 2. boy was it a beautiful show. it nearly made me cry. indeed the course of true love never did run smooth. i liked the personification of the ogres because in real life we are never like the prince or the princess. ogres more accurately depict our characters. despite our flaws and weaknesses, we still have strengths that shine even more because of our inadequacies. it's like we're beautiful despite our ugliness.

      Dear Heavenly Father,  &nbsp;  Thank you for this time of prayer. Lord, we are sinners but You love us so much that You gave Your only Son to die for our sins. It is such a privilege to come before You in prayer to bring our needs before You. Even before we tell You of our desires, You already know them. You just want us to come before You in faith and ask according to Your will.  &nbsp;  Lord, the state of the world today is so terrible and it must really break Your heart to see us like that. It seems as if we are helpless in trying to right all the wrongs but our strength is in You. I bring before You the drug situation all over the world. Humans are persisting in their sinful ways and harming themselves and the people around them. I pray that the effort that people are making to increase the awareness of the perils of taking drugs will be fruitful.  &nbsp;  But even more importantly is not their physical state but their spiritual one. Lord, I pray that You send more workers in the harvest to reach out to the lost. The harvest is plenteous but the labourers are few. Send forth your workers into the fields to harvest those souls who are ready to be saved. True change can only happen when Your Holy Spirit indwells in them to change from within. To change out of their love for You.  &nbsp;  Lord, do what man cannot do. Touch hearts today and bring them into Your kingdom. I commit this day unto You and pray that You do all that is in accordance to Your will and Your timing. I pray all these in the name of Jesus, Amen.

      Dear Heavenly Father, &nbsp; Thank you for a wonderful holiday. It was indeed&nbsp;a good time of rest. Thank you for the journey mercies and safe drive we had despite the rain. Thank you even for the guidance when we could not find our way around. Indeed You are a prayer answering God who knows our needs even before we bring them to You. &nbsp; Lord, prepare my heart as school is starting and help me to glorify you even in my studies. Even more importantly, give me no peace until I get back into close fellowship with You and other christians. Bring me back to church and use me to reach out even to those who are dear to me. &nbsp; There are issues in my life that I need to sort out. Lord, help me to live my life for you. Change me to be more and more like You. Purge me of my weaknesses and strengthen me from within.  &nbsp; I commit all these into your loving hands, asking all these in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Amen.

      ok its the time of the night to blog again. its been a while since i last blogged. not that it's a chore but just that i didn't have anything in particular to blog about.  going to be busy the coming week. working everyday except wednesday coz i got ippt and coz i club on weds. but i decided that after this mad week of work, i shall take like two weeks off to enjoy myself.  tentatively, the plan is to go malaysia sometime in the third week of july for a couple of days. just to chill and hang out and have fun. no fixed itinerary yet but i'm sure we'll figure that out as we go along. prolly it'll just be me and shawn. i think.  i miss all of your people whom i used to see so often. i know we can't help it that we haven't seen each other for the longest time but unfortunately, our schedules seem to clash. let's hope that when school starts, i'm only going to work one day a week and then we'll have more chances to meet up again.  time really flies. i look back and everything seems like it was just yesterday. my whole life is like one quick flash-back. in retrospect, everything looks nice and familiar. i don't really like the current situation. it's strangely alien and lonely. i heard a quote from adrian which says something like deriving strength from loneliness. maybe. but so not me.  i'm weak when i'm alone. i like to be in the company of people i like. i like to know that there are people out there who care for me and love me. yeah, i know my family loves me and i love them too. but you get the point lar.  i think i'm working to kill time. i got plenty of time on my hands and nothing much to do. so i just work to make all that time go away. the work is fine. in fact it's quite good. i like it pretty much. the people there are nice and the work is easy. i would nearly call it easy money. lol.  ok i'm sleepy. time to go to sleep. *yawn* good nite people.

      this is going to be a busy semester. all the modules are like freaking hard and mathematically inclined. i don't like maths. lol. fyp seems to be difficult as well. so i can foresee myself being extremely busy for the next 12 months. sigh. and i was so looking forward for school to start. timetable is ok. 4 day week but 3 days end at 1730. and two days are like 830 to 1730. argh can die. other than that, life has been pretty normal. i decided to work only on sats and ph eves. cannot work two days a week because i think it takes up too much time. worse come to worst, don't work. management seems reluctant to let me work one day a week. so we'll see how it goes.
