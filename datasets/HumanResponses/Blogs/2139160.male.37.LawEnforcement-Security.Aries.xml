      “What do you see?” the older balding guy asked.  “Nothing, paper, black ink,” I responded.  “No, what do you see on the paper?” he insisted.  “I see nothing. I see ink.”  “Ok, your not getting the jest of what I am saying here. I am want you to tell me what you think you see in the ink or what it reminds you of,” he said getting agitated with my non responses.   It was the first time I had ever been in a psychiatrist office and I was not there of my own free will. To make matters worse, I had been in a strip joint the night before and was still feeling the after effects of my night out. Perhaps I should have told him the image reminded me of the lessons I had learned on the previous evening.   The first lesson had been that Penthouse used an airbrush and possibly edited their photographs with some digital magic or both. The second lesson involved the bouncer in the club I was visiting. I learned that just because you can kick the bouncer’s ass, it doesn’t mean that you will be able to handle his associates. Apparently nightclubs have more than one bouncer, or as in this case, more than five.  So with the after effects of a long night still lingering, I entered the shrink’s office. My new employer required all applicants to undergo this evaluation along with the physical agility test, eye test, academic aptitude test, and polygraph examination. In my eyes, this was a subjective test, unlike the others and the pass/fail lay solely in the hands of the older and obviously gay man that was interviewing me.  “What are you thinking about?” he said and glanced at his watch. No, not glanced, he studied it. I watched him, realized he really was not listening to me and began to notice the other cues. The folder he held was at least an inch thick. I had never been in this man’s office and this was the good ole days. A time when the pages and pages of privacy paperwork now required before a doctor can look at the build up of wax in ones ear or some other mundane task did not exist.  The chart was not mine. This man is not listening to me. “I was thinking about food. I am hungry.”  “And?”  “And I usually eat when I think about food.”  “What?” he snapped up from the daze and back out of the folder that appeared to belong to someone with much deeper troubles than my hang over and bruised ribs. “What are you talking about?” “I was saying I wanted lunch.”  “O.k. can we finish here,” he picked up another inkblot and held it up. “How bout this one, Mr….  I thought, “he paused, he doesn’t know my name. This asshole is not paying attention here….’DuBose’.” I finished it for him.  “Yes, what do you see?” he again looked back at the thick file that he was now flipping through.  “I see me standing over your bleeding head while I pump round after round into your face.” I said. I managed a laugh but was cut off.  I don’t think the patient that corresponded to the thick file the good doctor had read during my entire interview got their treatment on time that day. My session was extended while he verified that I was not insane.  He didn’t look at his watch again and the thick file was placed on his desk for the remainder of the meeting.

      I would love to post something right now, but I must play with the template and change the colors around first. Sorry, comments, weather pixie, and other neat stuff coming soon.

      I write in outlook express a good many mornings. I do this because the spelling errors and grammar problems are not underlined for me. I can email what I’ve written to the office, open it on my lunch break, and attempt to find all the errors before moving the file to Word.  This morning, I wrote for two hours solid. Not about any one item, not about any subject in particular. I just wrote to write. As I got up to leave the room for a coffee refill, my new puppy, Bo, darted under my desk. I assumed Bo was after a ball or chewy toy that had been left there from the previous night; however, it appears that pup saw something else that peaked his curiosity.   Bo attacked the orange glow of the power surge protector. The computer shut down and I lost two hours worth of rambling. There were two blog entries in there waiting to be forwarded here. Sorry, the dog ate my blog. You can come up with the appropriate punishment send it via the comment feature.  Speaking of comments. If you are trying to comment and are having trouble with the new blogger comment feature, email me. I will change back to Halo Scan.

      Can someone call Blogger about the new comments feature. When there is one comment it should state just that; however, it displays one "comments". As if one has become plural. Is it just me or is this annoying anyone else? Will someone please comment or should I say comments? If so, comment twice so that I will be able to sleep at night. Thank you.

           First let me say that I do not find cartoons sexy. I chose my weather pixie because she was a red head and I have strong attraction to women whose hair is red or any variation of that color.      What concerns me about the weather pixie is that I checked "no adult content" on my blog submission. Over the past few weeks, as the weather grew warmer, the pixie began to shed clothing. At 84 degrees she was in a swim suit and what appeared to be 6 inch spikes.      When July and August arrive with their 100 degree days, what will my little pixie be wearing? Should I change my rating? Should I throw her a towel or robe? Sorry, these are the things that rattle around in my head. It's a scary place. If the weather pixie could see in there, she would run.

      Due to time constraints this morning, I'm running an older entry that I posted last year. Enjoy.....     To provoke and offend     Earlier this week, I had a profound experience in a convenience store. That statement is in itself enough to inspire an entire series of blogs (or therapy). I was trying to convince myself that I did not need junk food while standing in the middle of the candy aisle. As I considered my options and begged for restraint, in walked the poster child for the skinhead movement.  This young, white male was wearing only pants, hung low to expose his underwear and his shaven head reflected the fluorescent lighting. The no shirt and no shoes sign had apparently escaped his attention and he was obviously oblivious to the chilly temperatures outside. His body was covered in tattoos. I saw several swastikas, the words “white power”, assorted skulls and great many crosses. The crosses stood out amongst the profanity that had been permanently affixed under this man’s skin.  The tattoo that really reached out and grabbed me was in the small of the man’s back. It was a replica of a street sign. Its black letters stood out on the red background and an arrow pointed down toward the young man’s rear. The sign declared, “Exit only, no entrance!”  I stated earlier in the beginning of this process that I had a tendency to say and do stupid things. I should have put more thought into my response to the young man’s body art. I had just recently read in another blog that there is too much offending and provoking in the world. I was going to be guilty of provoking and probably offending. I didn’t have time to think, at least, that’s my excuse.  I pointed to the young man’s back and said, “cool ink.” His response did nothing to prevent my flippant conversation. He said loudly, “Hell yeah, f#*^k the queers!”  “You mean that’s an anti-gay tattoo?” I said pretending to be astounded.  “Yeah, you got a problem with it?” he said as he appeared to tense up his whole 120 pound frame.  I believe that people like this are almost harmless when outside of their respective hate groups. Alone, without the aide of his buddies or a truck full of diesel fuel and fertilizer, this young man was not intimidating. His legs were smaller than my arms and he appeared to be in poor physical condition. I stood over a foot taller, weighed over 130 pounds more that he, and had the backing of three more undercover officers in nearby aisles.  “Is that what that is?” I said, “I thought it was a reminder. I was just wondering if you were going to get one for your chin as well.”  I could see the rage building behind this man’s eyes. I also sensed fear. He could not react they way his group would have wanted. Part of me wanted him to react. I could only imagine this young man who appeared to hate everything and had the tattoos to prove it placed in a rural Alabama jail. A young, small white man with white power tattoos and large sign on his back that advised he would not be a willing participant in jail house sex. Attention in cellblock D, White Avenue is now open to two-way traffic.  Just as I reveled in my ability to raise this man’s ire, I felt a tinge of guilt, and embarrassment. I managed a half-hearted, “just kiddin’ with you man, chill out.” Then, I left the store empty handed.  I had promised to protect and serve. A promise is a promise and nowhere did that oath contain any amendments or exceptions. The same law that protects the many groups this young man swore to hate also protects him in his hatred. My personal beliefs and opinions held no bearing on that commitment. I was angry at my reaction and have reprimanded myself for my actions; however, I have to admit, it was just a little humorous.

      I took a break from this for a while, not that the world took notice, but I was a little burned out. I'll warn u that I am no longer burned out and will therefore write.
