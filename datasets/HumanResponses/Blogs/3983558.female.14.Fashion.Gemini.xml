						    hey ya'all. how are you doing? i am fine today. well i just wanted to tell everyone i talk to at least that i am leaving to go to wyoming. i might of told some of you and some of you might of already knew, but it was great telling you, cuz i hope my cousins think it's kinda cool that i'm coming up to visit. some of them do but i hope the others do.&nbsp;also i hope they don't mind me visiting and if they do then sorry.&nbsp; i really hope it will be fun when i get there; i haven't seen my cousins in at leat three years. it would break my heart if they didn't even say hi to me. but it is up to them if they want to be nice or be mean. well hope to see you or talk to you soon, or later.    ~littlebear200~

						    if you ask me i have an ok life but i have had lots of problems in the past. i wish i could go back and change some of them. but that won't work. sometimes i wish that i could have things the way i want it, but it just doesn't work that way. i know some people might feel the same way. but i have&nbsp; had love, drama, parent, and other&nbsp;things that i could of&nbsp;changed. i know they happen for a reason but i wish they didn't. well i hope everyone else's life is Better than mine. and i wish for myself that my life will be better on the way, as i live it.    ~littlebear200~

						    Starting sunday. I can't remember what i did but i guess it wasn't to important. Monday I Started going through my clothes and shoes to get rid of them. I have to send half of my clothes to my mom cuz i will be going to wyoming this week. and i don't wanna take all of my stuff, cuz i got to much. trust me. but other than that, i went to the store with my grandpa to get food then later that night, we went to wolly world (walmart) to get stuff for the pool cuz it's dirty. then today i started packing the stuff i will be bringing to wyoming. And now i am really bored so i guess i will end this here. well i will write another day, hopefully soon.    ~littlebear200~
