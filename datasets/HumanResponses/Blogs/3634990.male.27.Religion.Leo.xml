      It is interesting and a little disheartening to me how many evangelical Christians have married themselves to the conservative movement in America.  It is not surprising to me.  The conservative movement finds many of its origins in Christianity.  At the moral level there is much in common.  However, at the ethical level I think that they are worlds apart.  When the Christians fail to realize this distinction, they fall into a legalistic or legislation-oriented Christianity.  So that the vocation of the Christian is to be a preserver of society, making sure that we have proper laws in place that will keep our behaviors in line.  The Christians who are fighting to keep the Ten Commandments in our courts and to reinstate prayer into the schools are essentially putting their hope in right legislation.  In other words, they are putting their hope in Law.  This is what I don't understand.  I mean I think I understand, but I don't know why.  I understand that Christians may look at cultural trends and be more than a little disturbed by the trajectory of things.  I understand that the the human tendency is to provide correction through rules, laws, or policies.  I do not understand why Christians are running down this road.  To do so is to cut against the very foundation of our beloved Pauline theology.  Was it not Paul that taught us that it was not law but faith that saved?  When we take on the vocation of legislator, I believe we show our disbelief in the Gospel.  It is not that we shouldn't use our ability to vote and/or speak up, but I think many Christians are missing the point.  The following is a statement I am trying to work out.  What do you think?  "The moral claims of Scripture on a person's life cannot be made apart from the call of faith and discipleship to the God and the Messiah of Scripture.  Our transgressions will surely condemn us; however, the call to obedience to these claims cannot be distinguished from the call to faith."  What does this mean?  The Christian who seeks to work through legislation rightly appeals to the universality of God and his righteousness.  Because all are subject to this righteousness, it follows that all laws should reflect this righteousness.  Thus, the world will be transformed by their subordination to God's laws.  Doesn't this absolutely undermine the Gospel?  From my understanding of the NT, the moral claim that is made on an individual is not made apart from the call to "follow me."  In other words, the type of living that God is calling us to makes no sense apart from the decision to believe in and follow Jesus.  The ethic of the NT is not based upon a universal moral law but a new creation (a new way of life) found exclusively in Jesus the Messiah.    To wrap it up, this means that the vocation of the Christian is not one of legislator but of prophet.  The Christian must call the world to follow the Messiah, the Savior, the Lord.  We are to be truthful and proclaim truth.  We are to demonstrate in our lives and witness to others the hope of a new world, a new way to be human.  This is the proclamation of the Gospel of the kingdom of God.

      The biblical metaphor of alien is an increasingly real part of my experience.  One of my dominant feelings right now is that of being "out of place."  I feel like a foreigner and an outsider.  The fact is there are few places in which I feel at home.  It becomes an ever apparent reality that I am not "of this world."  Please don't misunderstand.  I don't say this arrogantly or self-righteously.  It is not that I am withdrawing from the world.  It is not that I don't have an intense love for the world.  It is only that as my desire for the Kingdom of God increases, I find myself more at odds with this world.  It is only that as I seek to follow Jesus more closely, his promise that it would mean conflict with the world becomes more inevitable.  I find myself an alien in this kingdom because I have grown to love and cling to my citizenship in another.  When Jesus says we must take up our cross to follow him, I do not believe he was telling us that we were going to have a tough life, in that we will naturally encounter difficult things in our life like Cancer.  I don't even believe that Jesus was commanding us to live a life of self denial and service, so that to take up our cross would be analogous to giving up cookies or giving up getting our way.  What Jesus was saying was "If you choose to follow me, the powers are going to crucify you."  In other words, to follow Jesus means the world will reject you.  This is the only way it can be understood in my mind.  The cross was a symbol of intimidation.  It was reserved for those who did not comply.  It was for those who presented a challenge to the kingdom.  Jesus' crucifixion, while theologically we say was for the sins of the world, historically was because his obedience to and proclamation of the Kingdom of God put him in direct conflict with the powers of this world.  As Jesus calls us to follow him more closely, it means that we too will find ourselves at odds with this world.  I am experiencing this conflict at all kinds of levels.  For example, living in an election year and during a time of war, there has arisen many strong opinions and many vigorous debates.  The tension between the right and left in this country is so intense right now that one begins to have real questions about our future survival.  Many think that being a Christian means that I am a de facto Republican.  However, being a Christian, I don't feel at home with the Republicans.  Neither do I with the Democrats.  Both present to me means and ends that I cannot embrace as one who seeks first the Kingdom of God.  In all of this I have lost my sense of patriotism in that I don't feel at home as an American either.  Contrary to the patriot, I cannot embrace the US as the light of the world.  I cannot embrace "the freedom to do what you want" as a legitimate human freedom.  I cannot pledge allegiance to the flag when my allegiance is to be for the Lord alone.  I don't feel at home at work.  Currently, I work in an environment that is driven my mammon.  Revenue is the end and people will attain it by any means.  One rep was telling me "it is all about the cash" as he offered me a deal that would require me to bend the rules.  I declined stating, "If I don't have my integrity, what do I have?"  His reply, "Money."    Unfortunately, in the one place I should feel at home, often times I don't.  I don't feel at home outside the church, but a good share of the time neither do I in the church.  So often the mentalities that I encounter within the church are no different than those outside.  Whether it is a Christianity that is more American than Christian, materialism, or whatever; the church doesn't always feel like home.  I love the church and will not abandon her because I know that this is because the church is "under construction."  It reminds me that while we taste many of its fruits now, we hope in a still coming kingdom.  And so I yearn as a foreigner, and pray:  Our Father who is in Heaven, Let your name be treated as holy. Let your kingdom come. Let your will be done as in heaven also on earth. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors. And don't lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever. Amen

      The basic purpose of this experiment is to have a place to put my thoughts.  I hope to put into words the thoughts that bounce around in my head.  I hope also to let others into this journey through feedback and response.  I welcome all comments, questions, and/or concerns.  I don't know where this is going, but here we go.

      Some might think that my belief in judgment and the existence of a place called Hell is silly.  It certainly is not popular.  And - to be honest - sometimes it is hard to swallow myself.  There are, however, daily reminders why I believe in such a thing.  There are reasons why this conviction has become a non-negotiable.  Turn on the news.  Apart from major happenings like 9/11, Al-Qaeda, and beheadings, there are the daily occurance of 2nd and 3rd page news stories like:  *The father who shot dead his nine children,  *The father who tied his two young sons to himself along with a bag of sand and jumped in the lake, *The father indicted for pushing his 4 yr old daughter from a cliff to avoid child support. *The daily reports of women and children who are abused, neglected, and exploited. *The crooks who steal identities or scam the elderly.  They are the nauseating stories that fail to surprise me anymore.  There are millions more evils that go on all over the world that we will never know.  For some, these evils are reason enough to abandon all belief in a god - at least one that we should be concerned about.  I myself am an atheist from time to time.  However, when I really think about it, if I let go of God, I let go of the ability to call these evils evil.  If I let go of God, these evils become not evil, but morally neutral events in a "that is just the way it is" world.  There is something deep within us that will not accept that.  It is that same thing that makes us doubt.  Not only must I believe in God, but I must believe in a god who will finally and definitively right these wrongs.  I believe in redemption and the far reaching arm of God's grace.  But when I see these evils, I cling my conviction that God will bring swift justice.  This justice will include judgment and restoration...Heaven and Hell.  Thy Kingdom come

      This is one of my favorite paragraphs from G.K. Chesterton's  Orthodoxy .   No one doubts that an ordinary man can get on with this world: but we demand not strength enough to get on with it, but strength enough to get it on.  Can he hate it enough to change it, and yet love it enough to think it worth changing?  Can he look up at its colossal good without once feeling acquiescence?  Can he look up at its colossal evil without once feeling despair?  Can he, in short, be at once not only a pessimist and an optimist, but a fanatical pessimist and a fanatical optimist?  Is he enough of a pagan to die for the world, and enough of a Christian to die to it?  In this combination, I maintain, it is the rational optimist who fails, the irrational optimist who succeeds.  He is ready to smash the whole universe for the sake of itself.   Holy love must maintain this tension.  It must maintain an equal measure of both love and hate.

      The job I currently endure has a lot of training.  Almost weekly we are in training meetings covering new procedures, products, programs, and so on.  The other day we were being introduced to a new program that would help to serve a certain segment of the market.  As this woman was giving her presentation, it became apparent to everybody attending that we would not get paid any commissions or spiffs by directing customers to this program.   When the opportunity presented itself, one rep raised his hand and asked the question, "So do we get paid for this?"  The answer was, "No, not currently."  To which the room of reps immediately filled with snickering.  At one level I understand the question and the response.  As sales reps, we make our living on commission and spiffs.  At another level, I was once again amazed how self-centered we are.   It didn't matter that this program was one that serves and gives value to the customer.  The ethic that most people are filtering life through is "I am here to take care of me."  Contrast this with the article I just read about Pat Tillman.  What is so captivating about Pat and his story?  One of the reasons for me is he didn't live life on the same terms everyone else did.  There was a larger story guiding him.  There was a greater ethic determining his actions than the one of self-gratification and self-indulgence that seems to dominate us.  Pat was not a Christian, but he lived with more principle and conviction than most of us.  He listened to his conscience.  He didn't drown it out with entertainment or creature comforts.  He didn't justify himself.  He didn't sell it out to be normal.  There was an interesting quote from this article that stuck with me:  "Perhaps Pat died in the mountains of Afghanistan because it was the only place he could get a good night's sleep."  Almost everything in our culture is pandering to our self-centerdness.  Even the Army changed its motto to "An army of one."  How much time have we spent reflecting on how our life is fitting into the larger narrative that binds us all together?

      **Our Father who is heaven,** We address a God who we are able to approach as Father.  He is not an impersonal force animating the universe.  He is not a disengaged creator who wound up the clock and let it go.  He is a God who created us to live in relationship with him.  He has established this father/child relationship so we would want, need, and love him.  He provides, protects, and corrects us.  He does not abandon.  He does not stop loving.  **Hallowed be your name.** For the longest time I thought that this was just a statement like "Blessed be the name of the Lord" or "Blessed are the pure in heart."  It is actually the case that this is the first request.  Our first concern is that the father's name would be treated with "holiness."   That he would be magnified and obeyed beyond all others by every man, woman, and child.  **Your kingdom come.** The kingdom is not a place to escape to but a continuation of the hope of the OT prophets, who looked forward to the "day of the Lord."  This is the day when the Lord would return to establish his rightful reign.  When he would overturn the curses of man's sin and overcome all enemies, the last one being death.  The prayer is that God would come to set the world right, and to establish his reign over and against sin, death, and those who embrace it.  **Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.** Related to the prayer for his kingdom, this is a prayer that the father's will would be done on earth as it is currently in heaven.  It only takes watching the news for one night to realized this world is far from its intended order and condition.  it is hell on earth.  Being people who would pray this prayer, we - like Jesus - make the will of God on earth our primary concern.  **Give us this day our daily bread.** For many this is literally a prayer for the next meal and God's provision of basic needs.  For others - most of us - this is a discipline.  In a country that has been consumed with consuming, we come back to evaluate what is need and what is want.  We are compelled to be grateful and content with what has been given.  **Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.** The first reality that we must own up to if we are to be in a right relationship with our father is that we are sinners who live and make decisions in willful disobedience and indifference to his will.  He offers forgiveness for those who ask, but more than that - as forgiven people - we must initiate forgiveness with others.  **Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.** The Bible has no concept of evil as an impersonal force in the world opposing the good.  Evil is an adjective used to describe persons and deeds.  There is one "person" that baits and traps all those he can.  This is a prayer to be rescued from the one who tempts, entices, and destroys.  For yours is the kingdom and the glory and the honor, Amen.

      As I previously posted, I am increasingly understanding - feeling really - the biblical metaphor of alien.  That is, as I choose to follow Christ and submit myself to his "way," I find that I am increasingly at odds with the world around me.  In other words, I don't feel at home...anywhere.   This alienating experience was reinforced the other day as I was listening to a conservative talk radio host.  Now obviously there are many things that I may agree with one of these hosts on, but it is not long before something is said that reminds me that we do not share the same worldview.  On this particular day the host was working himself up on the type of tactics we should be employing as we war against the terrorists - specifically those who are kidnapping and beheading foreigners.  Bemoaning the current "PC" strategy, he insisted that we must fight them on their terms.  In his words, we must begin to "fight evil with evil."  While this particular host has been the only one I have heard use this exact language, I have heard the general attitude from others.  In addition to that, I hear so called "conservative Christians" chime in with hearty agreements.  Am I missing something?  Was it not the Apostle Paul who said, "Do not repay evil with evil" (see Romans 12:14-21)?  This is where the conflict begins.  On the one hand, I recognize the providential work of God to restrain and resist evil through human government and the use of force.  On the other hand, I recognize that this is not the vocation of the Church.  God has not put us here as the world's soldiers to bear the sword.  God has put us here as his people to bear others' burdens.  We must resist and confront evil, but we must not use its weapons.  I believe Jesus, and his cross, must become our model in our response to these times.

      Yesterday, I took some time in the afternoon to practice the discipline of solitude.  I ventured over to a local prayer garden kept up by a group of nuns.  This garden is designed around the stations of the cross, and so I decided to sweat through the stations in 105 degree heat.  The stations begin with Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus struggled over what was to befall him just hours later.  Gethsemane is so meaningful because it represents the point when the will of God becomes terrifying.  It is a point in Jesus' story that assures us that Jesus is intimately acquainted with our frailty and fear.  It is easy to miss the fact that these moments in the garden are a point of crisis in the mind of Jesus.  It is very easy to gloss over this as we are reading.  It is easy to sanitize.  His words, "not my will, but thy will be done," roll too easily off the lips.  When we fail to acknowledge that this is in every way a crisis for the man, Jesus, we deny his humanity.  We forget that, while he may be divine, he became flesh.  We fail to recognize the way in which he was tempted in every way yet without sin.  None of us have endured temptation to the point of shed blood...When our capillaries begin to burst because of the shear tension.  I - for one - give in much sooner.  At this point Jesus comes face-to-face with the reality that is awaiting him.  There is real uncertainty here.  Will he be able to bear up under the suffering he is to experience?  Would it be blasphemy to think that he had real questions as to whether Easter morning would really come?  The will of God can be a terrifying place to be.  If there is ever a point the story of Jesus where we can know that he is intimately acquainted with our frailty and fear it is here.  Jesus gives us the resource to face the terror often accompanied with God's will.

      It is interesting that, as a Seminary graduate, I am now having to almost completely change my understanding of something as fundamental as the Gospel (The Good News).  The Gospel is so central to everything and yet I don't feel like I know it anymore.  I should say I don't know it as I used to.  It is like a person that I knew from the outside in one way, but as I searched and learned and discovered what is really there I began to see a totally different person.  This discovery for me begins in discontent.  There were certain dots that I could not connect.  There were certain aspects of the Gospel that didn't make sense to me, and I knew I couldn't explain it to anyone who was not already entrenched in Christian culture.  In the beginning it manifest itself in a strange uneasiness I would feel when I looked at the Scriptures that people used to explain the Gospel.  I saw that often times the Scripture used may have been only indirectly speaking to the point it was tied to, and that many times it was grossly torn out of context.  It didn't seem that the Gospel described in Scripture was the same as the one I kept hearing in the invitations.  For example the Gospel as preached by John the Baptist and Jesus was "Repent!  For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."  Where's the invitation?  Where's the prayer?  Where's the faith?  Where's the Heaven? And if the Kingdom of Heaven is "Heaven," what does it mean that it is "at hand" or more literally "has drawn near"?    This uneasiness spread to the questions about the very point of the Gospel.  If the point of the Gospel is to answer the question about how to get to Heaven when we die, why is Heaven barely on the radar screen for the whole first half of the book (OT)?  Why do we need a new way to get to Heaven, if the people before Christ already had one?  When we try to understand the OT on its own terms, I can only find a few intimations of the hereafter.  What I mean by this is that - especially in the OT - salvation was conceived of almost complete "this worldly" terms.  In other words, God was going to do thing like deliver Israel from their enemies or return to Jerusalem and bring a new, restored age marked by things like peace, the restoration of nature, the presence of God among men, and the return of all nations to worship him.  The OT leaves us with the hope that the Lord will one day return and establish his rightful reign on earth by exacting justice on the wicked and rescuing and restoring his faithful remnant.  Many people acknowledge this, but then see the NT as taking a more "spiritual" twist.  All of sudden in the NT the concern is not for law but faith.  The concern is not for Israel but the whole world.  The concern is not tied to land but Heaven.  The concern is not for the physical but for the spiritual.  The concern is not that God comes to earth but that we get to him.  I began to ask the question, where does this change take place?  Certainly it is not with Jesus.  "The Kingdom of Heaven has drawn near," seems to fit perfectly as a continuation of the OT hope.    Jesus sees himself as fulfilling Isaiah's prophecies proclaiming "the Gospel to the poor," "release to the captives," "sight to the blind," and "freedom for the downtrodden."  Every healing, exorcism, and miracle was a sign that God's reign had indeed "come upon them."  As I see it the "spiritual" shift doesn't really take place.  Even the very end of the NT ends not with everybody going to Heaven and Hell to spend the rest of eternity, but with God once again dwelling among men on earth, wiping away every tear and destroying death itself.  Although this post is too long, the thoughts are too immature and brief.  In closing, I guess my concern is that the Gospel I have known and the Gospel I continue to hear is anemic.  It doesn't compel me, and I can see why it might not be compelling to a non-Christian.  What is so "good" about the news that God has made a way to get to Heaven when he already had one?  The Good News was/is that through Jesus God has overcome the sin, the death, the disease, the bondage, and the injustice that mar this world.  Through Jesus, God is reestablishing his reign on this renegade planet (one soul at a time); so that we can affirm what our hearts already tell us, which is that this is not the best of all possible worlds, and begin to experience the work of reconciliation and restoration that God has begun and has promised to finish in Jesus Christ.

      I had my 10 years high school reunion this weekend.  10 years!  There are a lot of things I could say, but there is one insignificant thing that I must get out in the open.  It is not altogether connected to the reunion, but it was afterwards that I had a sort of resolution with myself.  For a while now I have become increasingly annoyed when I am described as being "nice."  I take this not as an indictment on those who have given such compliments, as much as an indictment on me.   Nice is like the uncomplimnent.  It is the compliment somebody gives someone when there is nothing substantive to really say.  They are not offensive.  They are not disagreeable.  They are not obnoxious.  They are not loud.  They are not dirty.  They are just nice.   For those of you who may be around to attend my funeral, please don't say "Brett was nice."  If that is all my life was, then please stay home.  I would like to be called almost anything else.  Here is a short list:  kind, sweet, humble, stubborn, meek, truthful, honest, childish, humorous, melancholy, dangerous, righteous, gentle, stinky, ridiculous, orthodox, unorthodox, heterodox  It really doesn't matter.  Any other word provides enough substance to be satisfying, even if it is a misunderstanding.  Just not nice.  So my resolution is to begin to live "not nice."  This doesn't mean it will be my objective to be offensive.  It doesn't mean that I will jump down the throat of anyone who uses this adjective to describe me.  It only means that at the end of the day, life is not about being nice.  We are to be a lot of things.  Nice is not one of them.    P.S. I would also like to find more substantive and helpful ways to describe others.

      I came home from the funeral of a 26 yrs old friend, who found herself on the wrong end of a battle with cancer, to find a voicemail from another friend, calling from the hospital to let us know they were about to have their first son.  The C.S. Lewis quote/paraphrase a friend of mine taught me, "You can hardly say anything good enough or bad enough about life," comes to mind.    As her firefighter boyfriend shared in the eulogy, "We go to a lot of calls where the people got what they deserved, Kulia did not."  My system allows for such things but isn't always able to answer the questions.  Why did this happen to her?  I don't know.  I do know that this world is not as it should be.  I do know that the Scriptures tell us that death entered our existence with our rebellion.  I do know that death is the last enemy that Christ is to put "under his footstool."  I do know that our bodies, which enter the grave in weakness, will one day be raised in glory and strength.  I do know that such tragedies produce many beautiful results.  But I still cry.  On the other hand, my two good friends are about to experience - what I know to be - one of the most awe-inspiring and life-changing experiences.  They will witness the birth of new life.  I pray that their little Cooper will be healthy.  And I trust that for them, as it was for me, it will be an event filled with so much joy they won't know what to do with.  Through these tiny packages of human life, I have learned innocence and purity.  I have learned to love like our Heavenly Father loves.  I have learned laughter, childlikeness, curiosity, and honesty.  I have been crying everyday since.    There is something very terrible and wonderful about these two book ends.  Somewhere in them - and in every chapter in between - I am finding life.  There is something truly human about all our experiences.  Many of us spend our days trying to minimize the pains and maximize the pleasures, but I believe real life will begin when we can embrace all of them and - in Christ - find for them their proper places.

      The only thing acceptable to hold as a conviction is that we should not hold convictions.  Today's man and woman wander around in a society that has long ago cut off its legs.  Our enlightened skepticism has finally pulled the rug out from under us.  We have not even a semblance of a worldview to make sense of things.  There is no story that binds us together.  We have reduced our ethic to the individual's right, and in so doing, we have unwittingly undermined even that.  As a society, we have come to the place where our firmest belief is our unbelief.  As a result of our agnosticism, I believe we have developed a few subsequent policies.  First, is that it is OK to speak of anything except those things which are meaningful.  What I mean by this is that we live by this unwritten rule that the "ultimate" questions must not be asked.  It is appropriate to talk about the weather.  The big game makes for lively debate.  The celebrities and their styles make for substantive conversation.  However, if any questions of significance are asked, lines are crossed.  Who are we?  Where do we come from?  What is our purpose?  How are we supposed to live?  These are all questions that we have relegated to the private sphere (if at all), and must not be brought up in conversation.   If they are, they are usually intercepted by a passive aggressive "Who can know?"  In other words, we are no longer able to talk to each other about those questions that all of our hearts secretely ask.   Second, is that it is morally upright to patronize other people's beliefs.  This might sound odd in an age of tolerance and diversity; however, in our quest to respect all beliefs, we have rendered them all meaningless.  We have moved from "I see...but" to "I see...and."  In other words, we refuse to respect anybody's beliefs enough to disagree with them.  We refuse to give any conviction enough honor to say, "but I don't think that is right."  We instead say, "You believe in God, and this little girl believes in Santa Clause.  See how we are all the same."  In the aim of respecting the diversity of beliefs, we have reduced them all to fairy tales.  Finally, is that the individual becomes the moral compass.  Galileo proved to us that the earth was not the center of the universe, and the "enlightenment" replaced it with the individual.  In our unbelief our ethic became the right of the individual to pursue whatever he or she desires.  The obvious weakness being that our actions affect others.  In response, we add the qualification "as long as it does not infringe on others' rights," and law becomes the manager of individual rights.  But because the ethic is grounded in agnosticism this law is up for interpretation.  We are seeing this everyday as our constitution and our laws are reinterpreted and manipulated to the individual's ends; so that, our system can now be - and is - used to uphold the individual's right to do evil.  As far as I can see, "enlightenment" has only led to our slavery.  As I stated earlier, we have cut off our own legs.  Our belief in unbelief has robbed us of all that is substantive about our lives.  The apostle Paul's words are true for this generation, also.  "Professing to be wise, they became fools..."  Our salvation will not be in liberation from ancient convictions, but it will be in our submission to them.  It is in our convictions concerning our creator - and he revealed to us most fully in Jesus - that we can find the right to question and find the answer to our "ultimate" questions, to love each other enough to disagree, and to live as part of a much broader story of which we are a part but not the center.

      The U2 lyrics "but I still haven't found what I am looking for," sum up the place where many of us are finding ourselves.  It seems that no matter what milestone we may cross, no matter what we have attained, there is always something missing.  It seems that undefinable something is always outside of our reach or just around the bend.  We may enter new relationships with a flood of adolescent passion, only to find out that it cannot be sustained.  The new job promises to provide the answer to all of our present predicaments, but before too long it becomes unsatisfying and we find ourselves wrestling with the same frustrations.  Maybe if we move, we can get a fresh start in some other land with new relationships, but even there our problems seem to follow.  I know it to be true of myself - and I hear it in the words of others - that there is an expectation that life -the real, abundant, satisfaction life - is in something we don't have right now.  And so we find ourselves in a trial-and-error pursuit of true life.  We enter relationships because they promise the love, intimacy, and pleasure we are searching for.  But when we find the passion fades, our freedoms are encroached, or just that it is harder than we think it ought to be; then we move on thinking we will find it somewhere else.  It doesn't matter what it is - whether a someone, a salary, a something - we can't seem to find what we are looking for.  True life eludes us.  Or is it that we have misplaced our expectations?  It may just be that we have placed our expectations in the wrong things, or that we have wrong expectations about what it will be like.   It is here that Jesus again shows how to be truly human and to live true life.  Jesus said that his food was to do the will of the one who sent him and to complete his work.  It was the will of God that provided the meaning and substance for his life.  It was the will of God that consumed every action, every thought, and every decision.  In the same way, our prayer is that "Thy will be done on earth as it is heaven."  The will of God is not some esoteric knowledge, hidden from view, but the kind of life we find lived/modeled in Jesus.  It is one characterized by love, righteousness, healing, forgiveness, patience, humility, and so on.  It is at this point that we find another opportunity to misplace our expectations.   We might expect that, in the will of God, we will find the happiest place on earth.  However, the will of God brought Jesus to places like the garden of Gethsemane and the cross.  The will of God brought Paul to places where he "despaired even of life."   We might  expect the will of God to be in the "significant" events;  however, sometimes the will of God was in the mundane endurance of his [Jesus] disciples.  So too, for us.  The will of God may not look like spectacular feats, euphoric emotions, or easy paths.  By asking ourselves "How can I fulfill the will of God right now?" more often than not we will find true life is in simple things like a difficult apology, a shared meal, telling the truth, taking out the trash, sitting in silence with someone suffering,  stopping to play with a child, and a thousand other everyday opportunities to display to the world what is the good and perfect will of God.  In so doing we begin to find a full life experiencing meaning and purpose in the full range of truly human emotions and experiences.  Every circumstance is filled with meaning and can be embraced as an opportunity to fulfill what we have been created to do.
