      Let's see...We are in trouble now.  Justin is pulling up on everything and he started crawling up the stairs.  He said his first word on Saturday--"Daa Daa Daa Daa Daa Daa"  The girls are doing good although they still haven't lost their teeth.  And that's not for lack of trying.  They sit at the table and eat carrots and then check the wiggle status of their teeth.  Gabe is doing good---rotten, but good.  I am having my wisdom teeth out on Thursday the 8th.  Whoo Hoo.  Brad is doing well, but work is getting very intense and stressful.  Pleas pray for him.  All in all things are good.  We love and miss you all.  Take Care!

       Well, I'm doing alright today. I'm moving all of the boxes from moving outside, since they're supposed to be picked up by the moving company soon. I'll be glad of the extra space that it opens up. I worked an extra long shift yesterday, 10am-9:30 pm, with an hour lunch around 5:30. I haven't done a shift like that in a long time..... (Note to self: don't volunteer for such a shift unless absolutely necessary.) Anyway, I didn't get to see John at all yesterday because of that. You know, he had the whole weekend off, plus he got off work Friday morning around 10am, so he had most of that day, too. Of course, he was asleep until I got home around 7pm, but that's beside the point. I don't think he did anything around the house at all. The least he could do is, I don't know, something. Dishes or something. I shouldn't have to be the one that does everything. I keep thinking about Mark. I can't stop thinking about our conversation from the other day. Am I really only merely content, or am I happy? I'm really not sure. I want kids, and I think I want them with John, but sometimes I wonder...... Is he REALLY who I want to be with? I know it's crazy. He is just so childish sometimes, and doesn't seem to have any self-control for most things. I'll admit he's getting better, but it's not enough..... You know, I'm not sure if I really respect him anymore. Part of it is my fault, but it's on him too. How many times has he told me that he's quitting smoking? Too many. And he has yet to quit. Oh, he says he's trying, but that it's hard. Problem is is that as soon as anything bothers him he doesn't try to deal with his emotions, he depends on the nicotene to deal with it. I want him to quit, I really do, but I guess I don't believe him anymore when he says he's trying. I know he's afraid that he can't, which is why he won't admit that he won't really try. I know that he can, I just don't know if he will. Why can't I get Mark out of my thoughts? He's a really deep thinker, and he wants me to be, also. Sometimes it makes me uncomfortable, because then I have to confront things that I'd just rather let be. You know, the old "if you ignore it, it might go away" thinking. Sometimes I wonder if I'm wasting my life with the wrong guy. Mark said that he thinks that I married John to get out of Alaska. What if it's true, but I just don't want to admit it? Why did I marry him? Do I really love him, or am I just imitating it in hopes that I'll convince myself one day that it's true and real? Such awful thoughts. He might be going to Kuwait in January. I don't know how I should feel. Upset? Relieved? Torn? Is it bad for me to not care if he goes? OK, OK, it's not that I don't care, because I really don't like having him gone, but I don't mind the being alone part as much as I used to.

       Living it up in Sunny Hawaii, life should be sweet, right?  Unfortunately, I don't know if I like it here, or maybe it's just that I miss some people back in Virginia.  I had people that I considered pretty close friends, and I left them all behind.  One person has told me that I didn't really have a choice, since I'm married, and nobody expected me to leave him just because he got orders, and I had to choose between friends, and him.  Well, obviously I chose him, but......  Another person told me that he can tell I'm not happy, I'm just content.  Too bad that he's right.  It would have been too scary to NOT come to Hawaii.  I'm married, we have an OK to good relationship, I think.  We don't fight.  Besides kids, my own home, and my family close by, what more could I want?
