      been absent due to ridiculous amounts of work...and poison ivy. Yes,...I have it again. I have serious mental problems for going back into that garden. but I can justify it slightly by saying that I went back in there to kill everything. To make it safer for the future.Almost a self sacrificing act. (almost) I have 4 new soccer injuries and hold great resentment for my dog. Stupid dog took off from me on the walk this morning and made me chase him through the woods and a condo development.fucker. wanted to kill him. instead i gave Connor two pieces of cheese right in front of him. He got the message.He's probably still sitting outside the fridge looking around curiously. oh poo..have to do work again.

      My Baghdad Badass wrote. Ahhhh, warms my heart. So nice to come out of a meeting and read something from a friend. Hate meetings. Just so ya know Baghdad...I don't have any vacation either. I'm watching everyone's houses and dogs while they go away. I have a band-aid on my left index finger and you'd think someone had just removed the finger entirely. I am totally handicapped. This is a job for spellcheck when I'm done. Alyssa just called. She's outside the psychics trailer while he gets make-up and hair done. He's reportedly seeing angel's in the windows of their shoots. If anyone was going to be seeing or feeling weird vibrations ... that would be Alyssa. But she's busy trying to get the beer out of the craft services breakfast cooler. Hey Alyssa - if you happen to hit any "specialty shops" down there - can you keep an eye out for Bee Balm for me? I'm also looking for any positive smudge sticks.I need to get into a better place zen wise.  But I had a decent weekend. Let me re-cap. Friday night I called TJ on my way home from work and we decided to meet at Tia's mexican restaurant. (are you a Mexican - or a meixican't?) I got there before he did and while I was waiting I sidled up to the very crowded bar hoping to get my hands on a vulgarly large margarita. As I was waiting hopefully for the bartenders attention I noticed a gentleman to me left down the bar...actually I noticed his tattoos. Vaguely familiar. Ohmigod it's Derek! aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! hide! run!  aaaaaahhhhhh! invisibility now! now! now! my eyeballs were getting very dry at this point and while I was attempting to blink he looked my way. ....sigh.......shit. smile..... hi Derek. I waited a moment for him to finally blink. while he was doing that I noticed that my initials were still on his arm.Ahhh college - when you thought it was a great idea to put your girlfriends name in ink on your body...what a fabulous time it was.We were such brilliant minds then. and now too, I'm sure. I mean I think I'm only marginally smarter now than I was then. He gets over his initial shock and comes over to hug me. He smells like he's been out in the sun all day. the girl at his side throwing daggers at me - not caring that he's ever met me before.She was just wondering why her cool hot boyfriend was hugging the yuppy chick with the bad pink locks in her hair. Oh but I have stories for you sistah. But I'd rather have a rash then spend more than a nanosecond with you so ...moving on...Derek...eek.He's still very cool in the fashion department. He had diesel jeans and a rope belt and a strange gas station-esque sleeveless shirt on that says Ed over his left chest. But he is not Ed...he is Derek. My super bizarre college boyfriend who somehow makes it through life without being shot or being thrown in jail for copious amounts of drugs. and yes, he's till 6 foot 8 inches tall. Hard to miss. I remember thinking that when I asked him out the very first time we met in Richmond. Wow - he's a bad ass looking mother fucker...wonder if he's free for dinner tomorrow? He asked me what I was doing there...I said . .(wait for it)...I was meeting my husband and son....(there was a virtual moment when he fell down there and I helped him back up) not everyone saw it - but I did.There was not much blinking coming from his side and I can imagine that his eyebrows were getting tired of being all the way up like that. his little girlfriend was still seething, too. In general defense he introduced me to the scrunchie faced girl. "Paula..." (this is where I find out how long she's been his girlfriend) "Paula, ...this is Healey" eyebrows still up and no blinking going on with him. She began to stick out her hand to shake mine and then a sort of realizatrion occurred within her..and the handshake stalled a bit...(ahh, she's been his girlfriend long enough to read his whole body AND get some backstories I see) Yes, hello Paula...I'm dereks past. Nice to meet you you little suburban tart - I'm not a threat you dimwit. Interesting to meet you too.Now go seethe somewhere else please.And try to find a shirt that fits sweetie. So she disappeared and Derek turns to me - still not blinking..."so did you marry that guy from the cemetery?" (uhm, What?) "I did a search online for you and came up with this article from People Magazine"...(oh yes, the David Hunter thing from about a million years ago) uhm, he he , no...I didn't marry him. But I'm still friends with him - he's a great guy.I married another guy. What are you up to? [enter TJ stage left with baby carrier] oh golly this is one of those fun moments you wish you were not having. I introduce TJ and Seamus to Derek. TJ seems nonplussed. Just trying to get an iced tea. Derek explains that he is now working for Ratheon in Baltimore. {oh, so this means that you are no longer selling Hash in New Amsterdam and fronting an industrial band while dating local hookers? Where is Paula right now by the way?} I explain what I am up to briefly -tell him we are living in Crofton, that I have obviously witnessed some crime that has entered me into the wittiness relocation plan and am happily living out someone else's exhistance.TJ smiles. Derek says "..really? You are in Crofton? I'm moving to Crofton next month!" This strange twitch starts up in my left eye. Paula shows back up to usher Derek to their table that is now ready.twitch twitch, by Paula. I'll miss you. Twitch. TJ and I go sit on the porch to wait out our time. On the patio TJ goes "so who was that? just someone you met trying to get a drink?" uhm, no. That was Derek. Of 'Derek from college fame'. oh. "he's a..." "yes, he's left New Amsterdam. It seems" "..and he's.." "yes,...moving to Crofton". I wonder if the government might move my son and I to another relocation site.   Saturday was chores and dog park. We are watching Connor, my parents dog, while they are in Maine for a few weeks.Connor was nice enough to wake me by biting my upper lip saturday morning.asshole.stupid connor. So I decided to take him to the dog park where he would realize that his life in this world can be put into question at any moment by whim of mine.He had never been to a dog park before. This was VERY obvious. You would have thought I had brought him to paris. He got his ass handed to him by a few big dogs and he just about dislocated his out of shape body trying to chase little dogs that have better cornering instincts. He ran into the shit barrel twice.  stupid connor. But he was deliriously happy. and then exhausted. I spent some of the afternoon taking on the poison ivy issue in the back yard.I poured about 5 gallons of Round-Up tough weed and brush killer all over the place back there. I really wanted to throw a match at it when I noticed that it had gotten me again. I mean I was wearing long pants and a long sleeved shirt in 90 degree weather and the shit is not all over my hands. I am so bitter. But it will be dead soon. die fucker die! I then went to the seafood market and got mussels and clams - I am pretending that I a m actually in Maine right now and so I'm trying to match the menu's. I made some wonderful clams Casino and mussels in white wine and Garlic. Yum! but I split open my left index finger as I mentioned earlier on a mussel shell. goddamnit. Sunday we went back to the dogpark to continue Connors Grand weekend out. he got his ass handed to him again and only hit the shit barrel once (improvement). The we came home and gardened a bit before heading over to the Noack's to jump in their pool. As you would imagine the pool was fabulous. Mrs. Noack set it up like a Kennedy outing with spring water in champagne buckets, spinach and feta munchies and mint and lemon slices for all. She hung with Seamus while Sergei and I taught Dizzy how to swim (threw him in the pool repeatedly and watched him struggle to learn doggpaddling). Connor got thrown into the drink a few time too. I fixed their computer and came home to BBQ some chicken and make a mint cucumber salad that turned out pretty darn well I might say myself.  weekend over.

      So yesterday, at my event on Capitol Hill, I was wearing a lanyard.  You can tell this when I'm naked. there is a distinct white line right around my neck. I feel as though I was 350lbs. with one of those rolling necks. went to the beach. got a bad burn. and then lost 200 lbs. (gross)  I may have to kill my co-worker here in about 5 seconds. and no, strangely it's not Oscar. Oscar has had a good day today. He even gave me two oreo cookies. Which I ate like a savage and then smiled black residue for the next two hours. Love oreos. No today's cancer is jojo. She is a project manager that is moonlighting as an art director. I have given her 12 graphic looks for the DTF job and she is still making revisions. This may not seem like a big deal - but wait - none of these graphics have made it to the clients eyes yet. yup. She's just deciding and redeciding all by herself there in her little office. This is like ordering sushi with Tyler. Blood sprays from your eyes and ears as they order...then reorder...then silence...then question to me (all the while the waiter patiently stands with pencil ready)...then she re-decides with yet another question and then she asks for them to give her more time. The waiter walks away...and Tyler closes the menu. Normal people would be using this time to 'hone in' on what their order may be. Knowing deep down somewhere that the timeliness of their order will somehow affect the delivery time of every single person eatings meal.  but this is a waste of breath.  Alyssa - I heard about your snowboarding boy toy and I recommend that you concentrate on the following word. "shag". It's like exercise. You'll love it. I have to go print out a mailing. I need beer.

       urlLink Welcome to Gmail   just got off the phone with Alyssa. She's a superstar. I don't know if I could be down in the stinky sweaty hot Bayou in the height of summer with a drama queen. DP caught up with her and is rescuing her for a drink friday night. He's so fabulous. If I was a gay man I would want to date him. He's so easy going and well dressed. And yet I've never heard about any of his boyfriends.interesting.  My soccer game got canceled for tonight.  boo. I really need exercise. Maybe I'll go home and do Seamus sit ups. I just know thats going to come back on me one of these days. I'm going to sit up and he's going to throw up into my face. It's going to be ugly. But I like Seamus sit-ups cause it makes me feel like I'm doing something with him. (as I am)  Shannon is outside my office complaining. She is so loud.And such a gossip. Yenny is with her. They're like the lone ranger and tonto. Except in this scenario The LR is an irish blonde and Tonto is not Native American but Chinese.  Yenny walked into my area this morning and asked what was up. She looked at my screen and saw the Blog icon.  there was a static hanging moment...where we both knew damn well what I was doing. It was in that moment that I realized that she too had a blog log. We seperated quickly thereafter.

      I'm currently dining on two day old potato salad.  Old mayo makes me very nervous.  Oscar just dropped by. (loser) (Hate him) He's trying to find JT ...to complicate his life no doubt. Actually thankful that he will not be on tomorrows Ride and Drive project.  My family is going up to Maine this friday. I am not going. This sucks. Not happy. I realize now that I have made some poor decisions that have led to the reality of my not being able to go. Marriage. Maternity leave. Moving to another state. Assuming a new job that requires more time at the office. ...it all adds up to me not having any vacation time.  (regret)  what's worse was that two years ago, when my life was normal, I knew it was too good to last. I mean I love my son and wouldn't trade him for the world.And the dog is entertaining. The house...it needs alot of work. everything else...ugh. It's all just too much work.  My family senses this and is pretending that the state of Maine does not exist. And that they are all just going into a dark closet for two weeks. I appreciate that. My family rocks.  Betty, my co-worker and co-commuter seems to be going through some similar summer let down. We've taken to driving and metro-ing in complete silence. As if we were just taken out of the mines and thrown into harsh sunlight. Resentful of the lack of control over our lives.  She's in love with a guy who works at a pub.  She has chosen to pursue this love by not speaking to this man unless being bitterly sarcastic to him and telling him to get lost. I try to persuade her that this tactic may not result in him falling helplessly in love with her.  She shrugs. This has been going on for so long now that I feel I need to go to the pub and see who this person is. I'm playing with the idea of going there without her and becoming an acquaintance of his, then later casually mentioning that I know her and feigning shock and surprise at the coincidence. I feel that this will put me in a role where I can be most helpful. But then I remember that I am a working mother and my pub crawling time is limited throughout the week. I mean I have a bloody block party to host. Speaking of which...I really need to get going on that. It needs some sort of competitive edge. Like a dessert contest. Best dessert wins a blue ribbon. I can gather a panel of judges - male neighbors  - and task them with using their inconsiderate nature for entertainment. I think I need to meet with some of the neighborhood Hens to review this idea. I'm sure they will suspect that I have some killer/ringer dessert that I'm waiting to showcase. I don't. I just want a bit of pie crust. back to work.

      New developments: One of my least favorite people is moving into the office next to me. This will be like getting peed on everyday, to see him. I am going to call him Oscar. (because he is a wiener). I detest him. To give you some insight on him, he has little yappy dogs that bite. (need I say more?) I was reminded yet again why there are professionals in the field of waxing. One should always consult a professional when approaching a bikini wax.If not only to have someone else to blame. I have become my own tormenter / physician. I wonder if Arnica is up for the job. Who knew hair would start to grow back so quickly? I mean I can only imagine that is where the irritation is stemming from. I appear to be dealing with phychological problems at long meetings. All this to look decent in a bathing suit I have no time or place to wear. I do have problems don't I?  Dizzy and I went on a horticultural crime spree last night in the neighborhood. There is this person who lives WAY down by the parkway who has these incredible blue hydrangeas. And they are just flopping all over the place. Totally going to the ants. mocking me. I curse him every time I go by his house in broad daylight.He's always right in the window. So Dizzy put on our darkest quietest outfits and headed out for a big walk at about 9:30 last night. The guy was right in his living room, nodding off in front of the TV and Dizzy and I were RAVAGING his bushes. I was like Edward Scissorhands. There is but a stump left there now. We even hit a few black eyed susans on the way back - just heady with our bold thieving. We casually came in through our back gate so as not to be seen by the neighbors out front. TJ was in the kitchen leaning against the counter drinking iced tea and watching Queer Eye. He suspected something was up when I decided to take a walk during my third favorite TV show. He gave me the same look he gives me every time I come home with a shoebox. That silent nod with the arched eyebrow. (hate that look) eek - everyone is in my office.

      Yesterday was another series of learning sessions.  I learned that one should not spray scrubbing bubbles into your mouth while standing on the top rung of a ladder with a bucket of dirty water betwix your thighs. (like that word...betwix) I learned that when trying to distract your dog from stealing all your towels while in the shower by putting your least favorite bra on him...one should consider the reality that the new dog door to the back yard is fully functional. And you should not be surprised when he tries to eat the bra off of himself (unsuccessfully) and takes a break to go wee wee in the back yard. And then comes back to the bathroom to lay on your nice clean bath towel. Life has a way of catching up with you. Thankfully I can see in color and spied the yellow spot right off. Why is it that dog pee is so yellow? I mean is someone feeding this animal vitamins? In a lame attempt to remain close to my friend Alyssa who is in N'awlins LA, I am reading the Anne Hache book "Call Me Crazy". I have no problem calling this woman crazy. She is the posterchild for planned suicide. What a fricking tragic neverending story. I only read this book on the metro (because it's my 'metro book' - not to be confused with my 'bed book' or my 'teach the dog manners' book)but I swear I've been reading this book for a year. And strangely Alyssa has only been gone two weeks.But I FEEL as if it has been a year. I FEEL as if I am actually aging right along with her -in real time- in this book. So far she has slept with most of the east coast (somehow I escaped)and had long relationships with Lindsey Buckingham and Steve Martin.I feel horrid about that last one. I really liked Steve. I thought he was better than that. But every ten pages I just have to stop reading and ask myself - "why is it again that this woman has not offed herself?". It's doing the country a disservice somehow.And I haven't even gotten to the lesbian part yet. I mean at what point does she switch over? Well I suppose when she runs out of men..which should be another page or two. Enough on Anne. (freak) that was unkind.  (freak!)  okay...I need to do some work.

      no mam, it's died that color.  I swear.   well I'm afraid that I will have to admit that my marriage is in the proverbial toilet. Interesting that I would have married a man that is my complete polar opposite.  Interesting and aggravating.  My family approached him yesterday while I was sick at home throwing up everywhere.  They asked him why he didn't feel it was necessary to have a job.  Or to have any incentive towards getting one.  I imagine that my house husband was stumped by this. I almost wished he had been wearing one of those red and white checked half aprons with the frill edging when they spoke to him. It would have made my day to have seen that image.  Things&nbsp;have been going down hill for a while.  But...as we know...complaining brings us no nearer to solutions.  I sat down and talked to him last night.  He was very upset by all the attention and maintained an attitude that "other people needed to mind their own business or just give him a job".  I tried not to laugh at that.  I did mention that he should add the neighbors to the list of nosy people because they too had asked why he was at home all the time&nbsp; - and yet Seamus was still going out of house for day care. (I neglected to tell him that I made the joke to the neighbors - when asked-that I did not trust TJ to watch Seamus - that he was at home presently practicing babysitting with the dog)   Some of the neighbors think I'm perpetually high.   Which is fine because this means they will never trust me to babysit their children.  It's part of my master plan.  Die your hair hot pink and scare the neighbors.  Some of the kids are catching on though. They want pink hair now too.  I mock them by telling them that Seamus can die his hair any color he likes  {once he grows some}.   Seamus proudly wore his Jimi Hendrix t-shirt to church the other day. I love that shirt.  Thank you alyssa. You are my dream shopper. I'm currently working on a "Sup Fool" shirt for him in his next size.&nbsp;   So my child is enormous. I mean just huge. I still don't know why I am surprised by this fact. But it's almost a scientific oddity.  The child has graduated to grabbing food and launching it towards his head.  He has absolutely no aim or arm control so things are likely to fly right by his head.  But the incentive is there. Semi-solid food is served twice a day and at those times he waits..open mouthed...hugging his favorite napkin...illuminated with excitement over whatever Gerber may have in store for him.   kid rocks.

      Today is Friday.  Let me give you a quick run down of some of the characters surrounding me.  YL is my good friend and confidant. I think the world of her and would probably do stuff with her outside of work if she didn't live all the way out in Hell's Kitchen. Plus she's not much of a socialite. More on the computer nerd side of things. Which I personally think is tremendous. It's a limitless field and if you're going to be a geek why not spend your time doing things that interest and challenge yourself, am I right? But she needs to go 'out of doors' more. (I have told her this).She agrees...but is not interested.  Next to her is DB. D is a newly engaged jr. artist. She is so pleasant that sometimes I think she is a plant. Not like a spy , but like a plant...a houseplant. ...that smiles.Even though I only ever see her sitting, I get the sense that maybe she is not too coordinated. She looks like a clumsy person, even sitting. But I envision her falling and then apologizing for falling, and then smiling. A houseplant.  Next to her is JT. JT is easy to describe. He is the hansom black man.  He's tall, elegant, funky, sexy and totally removed from our pasty white existence.  He seems to just be lightly humored by how little rhythm we have in absolutely every facet of our lives. But he will talk sports or TV with people from time to time. He is a very nice guy. I consider him a friend.  On the opposite side of all of them is TA.  Our leader. Our department head.  I don't even know where to start with him.On one hand, in my former life, I probably would have dated him....like for&nbsp;a week.  It would have been like one of those flash hot crazy relationships that seem too irresponsible to even afford the word 'relationship'. It would have been one  or two weeks of total lusty sex and then we'd just drift away knowingly.  Run into each other at parties and at bars and pretend you met them once at a dinner rather formally...but have that malicious 'I could eat you (if you weren't so complicated and time consuming)' look in your eye.  On the other hand... he is an over-educated brat.  The only reason he didn't get beaten up more in school is because he was raised in 'nice areas'.  He's something like 25 years old.  Smart as a whip. Has got his brains in keen order.  But would trade some of his brains for 'cool points'in a heartbeat I believe.  He smokes, which lends him a fraction of coolness. he argues about politics..but none of us understand and I&nbsp;only say things that infuriate him to infuriate him - he catching on to that bit- and he gets really quiet whenever he has to go to dept. head meetings.  He has alot of pressure on him. Possibly too much.  He works, smokes and drinks.  that's pretty much it.  Actually that's not true anymore - he has started playing soccer with my group and he's a mighty fine keeper. But rather quiet on the field.  Ultimately, he's a good egg. Just a bit jaded and scared (bad mix).  He introduced me to his girlfriend about two months ago and I was totally freaked out. She looks like she could be my sister. (But I know she's not cause my sister works with us) But his girlfriend has alot in common with my sister in attitude.  They are right.  And they are right ALL of the time - whether or not they're wrong, they're right.  And they both have that irritating mean girl chin movement. Where do they learn these things? If you ask me - they teach people these things at only one possible place - "ugly girl sororities". that must be it. It's like where the ERA meets lifetime TV. PETA must recruit from these places. Send scouts.  It's money, cynicism and condescension wrapped in a patronizingly superior&nbsp;package.  Lovely, no? YL could teach them alot.  People like these normally hate me. Which is fine. Shannon spent most of her life hating me.  She was good at it.  anyhoo. where was I? Ahh yes, work personalities.  I think I've mentioned Oscar in past writings. He's your basic dickhead, brown-noser.  One you haven't met is KH. She is my fellow commuter. She hates the world.  It's great to wake up and see her and her cloud each morning.  Have you ever watched The Powerpuff girls?  (don't frickin laugh) it's a seriously good show.  Well if you have - KH is exactly like Buttercup with a bit of a glandular problem.  Cause Buttercup is very wee. But she is a very reluctant superhero.  has rather a negative outlook on most things. (even crimefighting)  It's interesting to study KH. Cause that's what I do...I study her..to learn where the negativity comes from..and what it ultimately affords her.  He initial reaction to all new people is "I hate her.Who does she think she is?"  I find this interesting.  Notw to put some Bologna on this work sandwich, KH (miss negativity) has a whopper of a crush on TA. She is visually frustrated each and every time she see's him. She hates him for not wanting her. Absolutely hates him. and wants to have hot sweaty sex with him more than anything in the world. Interesting mix. TA who has NO IDEA she even is a female - let alone an available female, accidentally pisses her off constantly.She is not 'his type'...and I'm afraid I will have to concur with that.  But I am no help...I just sit around knowing everyone's story and fucking with that power from time to time. Like the time I invited Travis over to our place for beers and then told him that we were all going to swing by KH's margarita party for a bit. KH had dagger eyes as she opened the door. It was like her car blew up and she had an orgasm all at the same time.  She had no idea what to do with us in her apartment. I had worn special shoes for the event, I remember. Travis was underwhelmed by her and her friends which only fueled her lust-hatred for him even more.  oi...have to check back, forgot I have a meeting.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Shame they don't match what I'm wearing now. This morning has been eventful. I was coming back from walking the dogs in the jungle like weather of crofton (92degrees at 7am and 300% humidity)when I noticed a man with a spray can on a stick in my neighborhood. He was pretending that he was invisible...but the little blue lines he was drawing all over my neighbors lawns were quite visible. And quite confusing. So I blew his cover and spoke directly to him while reading the 'Annarundel County' on his shirt."what'cha marking for?" ...he looked at me (you can see me?)(yes, I can see you)(and now I'm talking to you)..."we're dropping new electric lines"...I looked back down the sidewalk from where he had come and saw the big blue line savagely drawn across Dominick new lawn of sod. I imagined him later that day laying crying in his ugly short sleeved oxford and outdated briefcase in that grass that he had brought up from little unrelated squares into one beautiful seamless rectangle. I should look into therapy groups for him today while online today at work. I looked back at the man with the spray stick. This was alot like having a rabid raccoon in the neighborhood.Quietly destructive. I put the dogs inside - gave them cheese slices as fast as the humidity would allow me to unwrap them. And then went upstairs to change into another outfit to wear to work. I had totally sweated through the one I was currently wearing and Connor snotted all over my right knee while on the walk -so rather than have to look at those little dots all day while in meetings and wonder if anyone knew exactly how disgusting their supposed team leader was...I changed. While changing I noticed [through the shades that I can see out of but of course no-one can see in through][need to change the shades in the bedroom]I noticed that the spray can man was now nearing my front door. I hurriedly ran downstairs followed by idiotic dogs that assumed that my new outfit meant we would be going on yet another walk. I could fart and they would rush the door.You have to love that optimism. So I get outside and it seems that Todd ( I don't know his name  - he said it too fast) and I had to have words for like 25 minutes while the dogs barked at him through the window for ruining their possibility of a second walk. The gist of it was he, Todd, wanted to make a blue mark right through my petunias...thus indicating that further activity was yet to come in that area. I explained that I did not want his blue mark - or any other activity happening in my garden and that i would stay there all day to defend my bulbs and flowers. He pretended that he was invisible again and moved onto the neighbors yard. I took this to mean that there was now an 'implied' blue mark in my garden that would be explained somewhere else to a man with a shovel, no glasses and no sense of how long it takes to get mail order Smith and Hawkins bulbs to feel comfortable in new soil.( a real fucking long time). So I followed Todd down the sidewalk like a bad odor and presented him with questions and some possible solutions. Did they have to dig where they put the line? "yes." would I be able to dig that ditch for them? "no." why? blah blah blah - this went on for another 10 minutes...so it was decided that I would come home and dig my own unofficial ditch through my front yard and I would hope that they would see this as a sign to "lay lines here - cause it's ready to go and all tulip bulbs have been moved to the relative safety of the backyard" and not just be stupid and dig another hole right along side of it endangering my lilies.You just know that is going to happen, don't you?  Well once I was fully covered in sweat again from being outdoors in the elements fighting the good bulb fight...I got my 35 bags from inside and got in the car to go to work. It was at this point that I was a victim of marketing. As I waited at the red light to leave Crofton..I spied that picture of the iced coffee hanging outside the Dunkin Donuts. This sign has gotten me so many time. I NEEDED an iced coffee ...(and maybe a donut)(for being such a good sport wit hthe electrical avenger.)So I cued up in the drive through and had my money all ready to go (not that I knew that a large iced coffee and one glazed donut would cost $3.51) I even had the penny. Just as I was second in line in the drive through - I felt something on my neck. It was moving. This triggered alot of things to happen simultaneously...my left hand slapped my neck very hard, I screamed, my right foot shot to the floor, my right foot being on the gas pedal for some reason it cause my vehicle to slam into the back of this very nice new blue suburban that was currently infront of me. I saw their little arm reaching for the drivers window to the drive through window only to be slung back like a little dollies arm. Thankfully not ever getting the coffee that spilled directly out of the window and onto the ground. (pause for breathing) alot happened really quickly there. My eyes were very wide and there was a dead garden beetle smushed all over my left hand. And I was kinda locked into my car cause of where I was in the drive through. Insert about 15 minutes of repetitive apologies and some police being happily called to a donut shop (what luck!). And then I had a moment of zen quiet to myself in the parking lot before I got to enter traffic and proceed on my way to work. which is where I am now...but not what I'm doing. I need to go do some work. If one more of my co-workers asks me if I want a donut...I swear to god....

      I’m abusing this forum by only venting in it. Bad me. Bad me. Got home last night and TJ and his mother were there. She had bought us about 47 pieces of LeCruset. All necessities I assure you. I’m hoping she might buy us a storage room for all the stuff she collects for us. This is possibly a bad time to not be drinking alcohol. I find that my nervous laugh, at events like coming home last evening, resembles mental illness more than absurd hilarity. But I have decided to control my diet. All the wine in the world will not change my circumstances. Not that I’m against wine. I’ve just already tried this avenue. Just makes things a bit shorter lived as I tend to fall asleep quicker.  But enough about the boring stuff.  I am still rather damaged from the soccer game Monday night. I have a fabulous bruise on my left wrist that keeps me from being able to wear my watch. So I now have no concept of time. Looks like my husband beats me. When actually he hardly even gets up for refreshing drinks, Sometimes you can really enjoy a bruise. I mean I know there have been times when I have really hurt myself and there was no bruise – and silently I was really wishing there was one so I could have a visual for my pain. And kind of a show and tell piece, too. “Hey look at my boo-boo. Yeah, gross, eh?” and then you smile and go on your way. So I guess, in that respect, Monday’s game was terrific. I have the wrist bruise. The scraped knee. And another, sadly invisible bruise, on my right ring finger. Makes me feel like I got into a fist fight. cool.  Kelli and I are currently debating why wine is not considered a portion of fruit. IM is such an important tool for situations like these. These little spur of the moment debates. I am arguing that it is a bit too far removed from the actual *fruit state. She is arguing that though it is a bit altered from it’s original state…a *Fruit Cup (reference historic school lunches) is still considered ‘fruit’ and it has all that other weird yellowy orange crap it's been sitting in for god knows how long. So I say neither is fruit. And to make sure I win this debate I cruelly sent her a website for shoes to distract her from continuing in this vein. Ha! Victory is mine. This is like throwing a handful of popcorn at dogs. Total distraction. House burglars should consider this approach for breaking into houses with dogs. Keeps them distracted forever. They can never be sure that they got all the pieces you threw. There were just too many to be sure. So they continue searching until they realize that the whole time you’ve been depleting their possibly supply and refocus on the bowl. Speaking of dogs…I’m beginning to read Dizzy pretty clearly. I once had a communication with Hoover that was borderline clairvoyant. I knew what he was saying and the reasoning behind him saying it.  Last night I came home to Manhattan traffic in my living room. Dizzy was upside down being mauled by Gram (Shannon’s lunatic dog) Mother in law on the couch clutching a child who was currently singing. Husband barreling around trying to look busy while sheepishly still taping the bedroom to prep it for painting. Strollers all over the place. Le Cruset all over the place. Mail everywhere. Me and my bags. Phone ringing. Then fast forward an hour to when I’ve changed and am cleaning. Dogs mauling each other in kitchen now. Shannon and Scott are over but can’t leave until my father arrives to return their choker collar for Gram. (no use leaving with something you cannot control). Enter my father. (Dogs have to be separated at this point because fatigue has set in and they’re getting scrappy, knocking people over.) Exit mother in law. Exit Shannon, Scott and Gram. Dizzy is released from the penalty box and I make dinner while we all discuss the merits of the 911 commission report. Dad comments on my gruesome boo-boo. (I smile) Exit Dad. TJ does dishes. Take dog for end of the day walk. He attempts to chase what he thinks is a squirrel {though we have had the discussion that squirrels are pretty much a daytime activity and not much of a nocturnal animal. So you can be pretty assured it’s not a squirrel when it gets dark) But alas he jumps full body at this person’s air conditioner that has just turned on. He has the brain of a toaster I tell ya. After our walk he gets his cheese slice at the refrigerator and retires to his dog bed in the front room [wishing that our walks could have gone on forever and totally forgetting the merits of having an indoor shelter area]. I bathe the child in the tub while Dizzy musters up the energy to steal our towels while we are not looking. He retires to the guest room bed with said half-wet towel until we go looking for it. He is evicted from the guestroom for getting the bed wet and slobbery while we find a dry towel. Turn clean child over to husband to put down. {You’re short. You’re whiney and you’re a terrible burden on your mother} Clean guest room. Attempt to find suitable clothing for next days work outing amidst all the madness of the paint prepping going on in the master bedroom. Where did all that shit come from??? Go downstairs after clothes selection and remember that I never got that days crop of tomatoes off the vines in back. Get my flashlight. Dizzy interprets this as “I’m getting my flashlight so we can go on yet another longer walk currently departing from the backyard”. He runs and gets his big fuzzy bone and runs full speed at the dog door …which, sadly, is locked at that moment so we don’t have a rerun of the day before when he knocked me over and we lost two or three tomatoes. He is not happy about not being invited into the back yard. He glares at me through the kitchen window. Dramatically dropping the fuzzy bone and turning to walk away knowing he is unloved. I get my 47 oddly shaped tomatoes and head back in. There is a strange silence in the house. TJ is on the computer downstairs. Seamus is asleep in bed. It’s 10:30. Where is Dizzy? I check the guestroom. All the pillows have been knocked to the floor again. I walk back downstairs. He’s on the leather couch…pretending to be asleep. I get a ‘one eye’ glare. The leather couch is off limit to those not possessing a thumb in the house. He knows this. This is not an accident that he is up there. This is activism. I suggest that we ALL sit down on the floor for a moment and have some face time. I read him one of Seamus’s books (cause he doesn’t understand why no-one thought of reading him one) (he likes stories) so we read “Give a Moose a Muffin” and then retired upstairs to fix the pillows and go to bed. End of Tuesday.

      I’m going to need a few moments here…. I mean I don’t know where the surprise actually comes from….but somehow deep down inside me - I have a bottomless pit of surprise available for TJ’s very own use. TJ is supposed to be doing many things right now. Let me list a few – - Walking the dogs. - Restocking the baby’s room with diapers and wipes. - Restocking the bathrooms with toilet paper - Doing laundry - Paying bills - Going to the market for any of the things on the list that has been sitting on the counter for a week - Applying for college - Considering the fact that his course has an open house tomorrow morning at said college. - Moving the gigantic tree branch in the front yard - Vacuuming the dog hair that he was commenting on this very morning - Finishing the pre-paint taping job that was started yesterday and that has rendered our bedroom off limits. - Painting the actual bedroom - Getting a replacement for the telephone on the main level - Making the breakfast cups he’s been talking about making all week (that I went out and got ingredients for) - Cleaning anything…absolutely ANYTHING in the house - Or even just exercising. - Writing thank you notes to any of the people involved in the christening.  ..but nope. He had lunch with his mom and now they’re out shopping. Mind you that she brought over $300.00 worth of clothes for ‘only his highness’ just two days ago. But they’re “not really getting clothes…I mean they got some – but they’re *really shopping for pots and pans”. Yeah, cause we NEED those. We have more pots and pans than we can currently house. They are all top of the line Caphelon and LeCruset pans. It’s like we had won the pot and pan lottery at some point.  So that’s what they’re doing right now. They’re shopping. Gluttons on the town like cows with credit cards and no fences.  What I would give for a man who just goes to work…gets some shit done…watches football on the TV…has friends…maybe even disappears and golf’s from time to time.  What the hell.

      This diet is going really well. I had fish and chips for lunch and now I'm having a cookie and a cup'a tea. Nutrition is a dutch word that means you didn't have enough change for the vending machine. Had lunch with Travis again today downstairs at the overpriced sandwich bar. Since the bartenders sexual frustration with Travis has manifested itself in the form of ridiculous amounts of free refills - I decided to order water. Last time I ordered diet coke. Took me three hours to come down from that sugar/caffeine high. I think I had like six diet cokes in the span of an hour lunch. Didn't even realize she was refilling them until someone pointed it out.  Travis is a somewhat muddled personality. He really enjoys *not talking. He revels in how uncomfortable that can make certain people. I think he was disappointed with me for not really being to put off by it. But then I have different training...my mom was a stewardess. I can talk walls down.  All the children have outlined their bodies in chalk in the car park and it looks like a police scene after a massacre. But it was a *wee massacre, he he. they even outlined the little peoples braids. love that.  Had an interesting dream last night. Gary from the soccer club was in it. (strangely). In my waking life I don't have that much interest in men half my size. But in my dream state they seem to be a hit this week.What they lack in height, they make up for in ...Ingenuity. ugh. travis wants me in his office. more later
