        The Unseen Forces' Blog FAQ v1.0     Who are you?  I am Unseen Forces, the owner of this Blog. I am a sadistic, painfully blunt, sometimes absent-minded, and strange individual. I may be borderline psychotic sometimes, but that's perfectly normal... isn't it?   Elaborate. Posthaste.  Fine. My name is Dylan Williams. I am 13 years old. I live in upstate New York, which is full of rednecks. You do know what a profile is for, don't you?   Hey, I know you! I'm going to tell (Name) what you said about them!  Bite me. And while you're at it, perform some sort of self-mutilation. It entertains me. (In the rare case that I use actual names, go right ahead and tell them what I said. I don't care.)   How should/can I contact you?  Again, this is what a profile is for. Read it for more details.   Ha ha. Homestar Runner sucks.  DIENOWPLEASE.

      Finally,  Deities and Demigods  and  Epic Level Handbook  came. Gods and Uber-Content. Who couldn't like that? Anyways, sorry for not updating for the past couple of days. I had to go to school yesterday for some crappy award ceremony where I got like 4 awards. But its summer vacation, so I'm not going back to that hell hole for a LONG time.  I'm going to leave for Virginia on July 5th, so I'll be posting from another state that night. Believe me... There will be NO shortage of stories for me to post while I'm there. After all, I'm going to be in Richmond, which is certainly more active than a farming community.

       urlLink www.thisisnotporn.com  is possibly the weirdest website I've ever seen. Well, maybe not, but it is still quite haunting. When you first go there, you're greeted by a picture of an oven (t0wN iDi0t: What a wonderful oven.), as well as a pop-up window titled "SAVE HIM!!" containing the text "HELP I AM DROWNING!!". After you click on the oven, then you'll really be intrigued. On the next page, entitled "afg bbb bai bab adc aig bba baa adc ahd bab bab aef", there is the phrase "Asia Awaits". How lovely. Blame the Koreans. Following the phrase is a mass of garbled text. Select all of it, and paste it in Notepad with Word Wrap off. You will get:  "Alexander cut me. An oracle predicted me. A future king tied me. Say my name to clear your path."  It turns out that the answer is "Gordian". I learned this after a heavy dose of Google. So, if you haven't already, click on Asia Awaits. The username is "Alexander", and the password is the answer to the riddle, "Gordian".  On the next page is a Scandinavian import furniture truck. Click on it, and you will receive the following text in a new window. And its in a different language! Yay! It translates into "The boy will only die". Weird, huh? Now, the hex within the page says "To get to the next site, find the place where the boy last died". Now, we can infer that this probably relates to the drowning mentioned upon entering the site. More research about the picture's location and a drowning reveals that the boy drowned in IJsselmeer, Holland.  Now, you may be a little freaked out by the next page. The  urlLink next page  shows a rusted sign attached to a tree, with eerie background music playing, and is titled "HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?". If you let the background music file play once (I think once), a blank alert box pops up. Woah. Anyways, click on the sign. The window will close, and another page in another window will load, but first you need to type another password. WhatALovelyDrapeTheyMake. I have yet to figure that out.  All of this information can be found at  urlLink this page .

      Yesterday, at around noon, I finally woke up in a pool of saliva. You could pretty much label my sleeping habits as FUBAR. Anyways, I went downstairs, still in my boxers, and heard that 2 people had called: my good friend Jacob Fenton, and (Name Deleted). Now, I called Jacob F. and asked him what he wanted. He wanted me to spend the night. Oh joy. I'm free from dumbass calling me AGAIN. So I called him and said I'd be leaving to come over in about an hour. After hanging up the phone, I didn't even call (Name Deleted). Why? Because he gave me a phone number that isn't even his. Whenever I call it, I get a weird answering machine or somebody saying I have the wrong number. How stupid IS he? We'll never know.  Then I took a shower and posted in the blog. It's my new hobby, actually. After I finished I got all of my D&D books together, as well as some extra clothes, and headed over to his place. When I got there, his 12-year-old cousin Kyle was over. Kyle is an OK guy. He hasn't pissed me off, yet... He had these stupid ***** 6th and 5th graders yelling at him at the last school dance I went to because some other slut danced with him, and then she told her little friends to go ***** and scream at him about staying the hell away from her. So I'm like "WTF?" and start flipping out at one of her ***** friends when they were yelling at him. She walked away quite shocked.  So we jump in Jacob's pool. It was kinda cold, but it warmed up. Jacob, being an idiot, locked the doors on me and Kyle, after we changed and only had towels around our waists (Jacob has a changing stall outside where there are towels, and we're not allowed in the house with our dripping trunks). He ended up telling Kyle and I that there was a key under a pot near his front door. Man we were idiots. It turned out there wasn't a key, and 2 women were getting out of a car in his neighbor's driveway. They honked at us. We were pissed. Finally he let us in, after Kyle mooned him and started yelling. We dried off and went outside to take part in more idiocy.  Jacob told us that these 8th grade girls (not bad looking actually, they're considered freshmen since they've already passed 8th grade) were having a sleep-over in a tent. I suggested a panty raid, and explained to them both what that was. Kyle asked Jacob to get on his ATV and ride over to see if there was a tent. There wasn't. Damn.  So he and Kyle were riding around on the ATV for a bit, at one point chasing me (I was on foot). After that, Jacob pulled out his riding lawnmower, and attached a sled to it. He drove around the lawn pulling Kyle and I, suddenly accelerating when we were trying to get on, and dragging us through bushes and a pine tree with painful needles. One time, Jacob was pulling me around the yard around this large clump of tall grass, and got stuck. So he backed up at an angle and turned around in the opposite direction I was facing, and ran over my leg. If only the blades were on...  After that "near death experience", we went swimming again at 10:00 PM. This time Jacob and I got out before Kyle and locked him out again. I bet you can tell he wasn't very happy. Then we let him in, watched some Saturday night anime, American Pie, and went to sleep.  We all woke up at around 9:00 AM the next morning, and got dressed and went outside. We set off a crappy smoking tank firework, and went back inside and watched Dumb and Dumberer. Too bad I didn't get to watch the whole thing, since my grandfather picked me up in the middle of it.  In short, yesterday was a fun day, except for the fact that I could've got my leg cut off.

      Let's take (Name Deleted) for example. He came over to my house yesterday and spent the night. The stench! Somebody save me. He smelled like a fat kid who just got out of PE. And he wouldn't stop asking me questions. He was playing DBZ: Budokai for my GCN in the morning, and I was still trying to sleep. The conversation went like this:  (Name Deleted): Hey, Dylan! Does this game have any codes? Me: No. (5 minutes later after almost getting to sleep) (Name Deleted): Are you sure? Me: Yes! (Name Deleted): Because a game like this has to have codes! Me: It doesn't, now let me get back to sleep.  And he laughs at the stupidest things, almost wetting himself (seriously) in the process. Oh, and I can't forget the ENORMOUS surprise he left in the toilet for me (I thought everybody knew to flush; but then again, this thing was massive, and literally shaped like a banana). Thank god he's leaving July 2nd.  In short, I hate morons. The only reason why I had him over was to get the $35 I mentioned yesterday. Plus, he never stops calling me. Man, I need to get caller ID.

      Sweet. I now have a G-Mail account, thanks to a wonderful man by the name of Nathan McCurley (A.K.A. Ateo Fiel). You see, there's this wonderful thing called  urlLink G-mail Swap . It lets you create an offer for an invitation to G-mail, which are extremely hard to come by (but not in this case). Hell, I made an offer of nothing, and I still got an invite from this wonderful fellow.  Although not as flashy as Hotmail, G-Mail still owns everything. I mean, you can Google ( Google  - v. - to search for with Google) your mail. I don't think I need to elaborate on that. Your conversations are automatically organized into easy-to-read sections when you open any part of them. But those aren't even the best part. You get 1 Gigabyte of storage. Yes. One Gigabyte.  In short, G-Mail > H0tmale nd y@huu 2 tha infiatae!1!!11!! And as soon as I get my invites, I may consider giving them away to a few select people.  Accounts promised to (so far): MegaWes  In fact, Wes is going to be a member of this Blog. So don't be alarmed about somebody else posting.  In other news, I got $35 today. Hopefully I'll have  Deities and Demigods  and the  Epic Level Handbook  ordered by next week. And I definitely need to get working on my D&D Campaign.

      If you couldn't tell, I don't blame you. So... yeah... this is the first post.  Anyways, after wading through a cesspool of boredom this morning, I logged on to the  urlLink GameFAQs.com  message boards, and heard that you could get a free G-Mail account by signing up for a Blogger account. Man, was I pissed when I signed up for this free blogging service and get nothing in return, except the ability to take the first amendment to a whole new level.  So, now I'm trying to coerce one of the members at the message boards to invite me. Looks like I may have a chance with one person. Thus begins the quest to get mail with 1 GB of free space.

      After 2 weeks of much needed vacation from Blogging (yeah, right), I am posting again, but only when I get the chance. I won't be able to do this again until the weekend or next Monday, because I am going to the mountains with my father.  Anyways, after riding about 11 hours in the car, I finally stepped onto my grandmother's lawn. Let me tell you, sitting in a convertible for hours on end can really wreck your legs. Well, at least I got some Coke and McDonalds out of it. Pfft.  But you see, I'm out of redneck country for a month and a half. And I finally have access to a high speed internet connection. Cit-Tele is too lame to make it cost less than $50 a month, so I'm normally stuck with dial-up.  However, I still have to do work during vacation (Me? Work? Hah.), such as being a roadie for my dad and mowing his girlfriend's lawn.  I'll post again as soon as I get the chance. Peace out.

      Rather than tell you what happened, which would take an assload of time, I'll just say that I went on a month long vacation and had fun. Lots of it. Indescribable. Which is why I'm not going to take the time to do it.  So anyways, I'm going to start ranting (or posting, whatever you kids call it these days) again starting today.  All is well in northern New York. The wannabe punk bike-gangs are still riding the streets, the imbeciles are still yelling at me, and the rednecks are still rednecking. Nothing too interesting, at least not worth blogging like the lawnmower incident. But those types of things start happening when schools starts. A lot.  In the meantime, it's time to go to H*R. NEW STRONG BAD E-MAIL TODAY, I think.
