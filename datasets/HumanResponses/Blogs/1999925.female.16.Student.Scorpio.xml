      Last night and Today was fun ^^  Last night we (Jyan, Eden, Takao, and I) went to the new Starbucks and we got to sit on 'our couch' (haha!! Eden ! You are crazy ~~ hey! Maybe one day we will have our own Starbucks and it will be so crazy ^___^ hehehe~)  Today was good! This morning, while walking to Art class, I seen one of my HK friends.. Jyan says I should ask him to go to Starbucks with me and he did say he wants to  do something with me this school year ... so ^O^ I think maybe it is good.. ^^ My first class was funny when Rinn got some paint on her ear! Haha!! Then it was my Engrish class > Hmmm Hmmm, I fell alseep in my Math class again > I think maybe I didn't do so good on my Bio test > O! Today after school I seen a so good Juunanagou/ HK guy ( should I dare to say Honger ?! I don't mean it to make ppl mad :'( My friends even call themself that ) But he looked like Koichi Domoto!! :D I will like to meet with that guy but he goes to the other school and is maybe about 20 - 24 years old.  Well I should shower now and try to do HW before I am tired and wont want to do any. hehehehehe ^.^: - alei ^^  (song) *Around the world * by : Initail D   Around the world  * (Now we ごった start Let's get move!!)     * Trip と the world  よ! へれ we ご unknown world へ と うまれた ばかり の たびびと  なれない あしどり も また あいきょう キメル とこ だけ ばしっと!  そ many people いん this world とき に ちゅうしょう とかもない わけ じゃ ない けど  しまんない とこ は Warp して こう すじ だけ は とおして いきてる That's our low!     あて の ない Trip  おね way ticket と your soul, let's ご ぶっとびつづけ みつける Your goal  あいしあい じだい に かんじあい さまざま な ドラマ つくって こう  そ many things we わんな try Pop song の そこ に かくれてる Deep style  ごじゅう おく の ねがい うずまきく World きっと だれ か に とどく Your light     いき さえ つけない ねむれない まち  すき も みせずに わらい あって  うそ さえ Safety ホント が Empty  あぶない ぐらい に わんな shut and break out!     * repeat     # Let's move いんと the brand new world  Let's dive いんと the brand new trip  ひろい せかい に おびえてる  はじまった ばかり の  Now we ご full speed and funky beat  きっと かがやく around the world     だれ か に とどく まで ちから つよく Brand new wind  みらい を えがく ちず も ない  あい だって こい だって マジ に であいたい よ  It's the ちめ と travelin' around the world     いんふょっまちおん びょうそく で つたわる じだい でも Choice の しかた が わからない  Money can't buy my love なんて ノンキ な やつ に は ラリアート さんかい  マンユアル どうり に ただ だきあい あい が ない こと に きがつかない  ちつそく する まえ に さけぼうぜ ほ!!!!!! いん the midnight dream     あつい おもい を おさえ きれずに  ねがい は そら を つき ぬけてく  さいご の 90's いきてる Full speed  Now イ know イ わんな start と move いんと the rhythm     * repeat     % せかい の はて に たち はだか で かんじたい  うまれ はじめた けしき-たち  あす だって ゆめ だって マジ に であいたい よ  It's the ちめ と Travelin' around the world     (たけ it いん your soul)

Then the second one he put the paper infront again but this time made a slurping sound ! O_O wowowowowowo~  Anyways, our play went as we wanted it to and everyone liked it ^^  After our play I became sick X_X So, when I got home I wrote an e-mail to my HK friend about some things and congradulated him on his good work on the play ~ When I checked my mail today he wrote to me and hoped that I was better and so on ... but he also asked me if I liked him with or without his glasses (o^-^o) hmmm~  Well I am still a bit sick so I will rest now ^^ - alei ^^  (song) *Ai no Uta* by : Psycho le cemu  Ai no Uta  There will be hope !

Exhausted, without the strength to search people vanish into the infinite darkness.  If it's so small, I wonder if I can see it even now?  * As we live on,   we lose a little bit more.   Shrouded in falsehoods and lies,   we stand frozen to the spot, unable to cry out  The days pass by and change, without us even realizing how blue the sky really is.  Overcoming that made-up scheme, we live the present, and our rusted hearts begin to beat again!  If we can find the rhythm of time, we can fly once again  We live our lives wandering to the ends of the earth. Believing (in you?), now I begin my journey with you, in search of the light.  * Repeat  We live our lives wandering to the ends of the earth. Closing off the way back, we walk on for eternity.  We live our lives standing frozen to the spot, unable to cry out, for eternity...

Wow ~ That was 4 years ago ! ^-^ Haha ~ I remember one girl I used to be friends with, her mom had seen the picture and said it was really good and then the girl became angry at me ;_; I told the mom that it was a stupid drawing.. but she still was mad >o Anyways, the song I picked for today is really how I have been feeling alot ~ *sigh* (read the song) Wow ~ Listening to F4 makes me think of him .. but I think I always do anyways ^^;  I often catch my self drawing some kind of anime character of him during classes .. ^.^ Am I obsessed !? NO WAY ~  I looked around my room to find my Christmas card list ~ He was on it and now is checked off  ^_^ But I hope I won't be nervous to give it to him.. *blushes* He is the most lucky cause I gave him a note aswell tell him he is my dream guy XD haha ~ I am so scared to hear what he will say to me when he sees it is him !

      As I sat on my bed awake in the late our of lastnight, gave me time to think of some improtant things to me ~  Some were of the past and some were of the present. I often wishes that I could have the summer back. Those were good times ^^ Haha~ Always having parties and playing DDR ^_^ Also, there is always the times when I didn't sleep until early morning ~ 5 am, 6am and sometimes 7 am ! Hard to believe that this was my everyday routine practically. My day was usually one of these 2 things :   1) - has gone to bed at 6 am so wakes up at 2 pm     - does " morning " routine  ( washing, eating, dressing and so on )      - calls friends to make planes for the day (if not have spent the night from tiredness of the previous night)     - checks e-mail and chats untill friends arrive (if friends have splet over then rest untill other friends arrive)     - when friends arrive cook for them XD or give them something to eat ( I am usually like a cook or chef for them ^^' ) * gets frying pan out * " food anyone ? "      - Play DDR !!! (Top thing to do ! You can get fit and have fun at the same time XDDD)      - Dinner~      -  After dinner is usually to go out and cause trouble ?! " I'm a good girl .. maybe ^.^' "      - When the sun goes down ... P-A-R-T-Y !!!! *gets strobe light and glow sticks out*      - Sleep _o_ zZzZzZzZzZzZz ...   2) - goes to bed about 6 am and wakes up at 10 am ! ( O_O I need more sleep ~ )      - gets ready for the day ( same as #1)      - checks mail and chats to family, friends and others     - calls friends to make plans for after dinner ( Seems as though "taking it is easy" is important for these kind of days )      - Dinner ~      - after dinner go out to friend but doesn't " P-A-R-T-Y " ( Seems everyone is a bit tired today )      - go home about 2 am to check mail before resting      - chat to friends and others      - sleep ...   But now it makes me sad a bit.. wanting the Summer and 我的夏天希望 .  But then again, Christmas is comming soon. 23 more days I believe...Thinking of Christmas makes me always want to go iceskating. Going with my friends is fun and an option, but I would really want to go with my " dream guy " . Remembering parts in Manga and so on makes me want this even more ! 多么浪漫!  *blushes* If I do fall (which I usually don't) he will bend down and offer me his hand *laughs* When he does help me up maybe I will push him then ~ Haha! Am I really this crule ? " If you push me I will push you back..."  Now I want to go to Downtown! ^ ^ Everytime at Christmas they put Christmas lights in the trees ^_^ It's a nice view and enjoyable to walk there. Even more enjoyable with my " dream guy " ~ Maybe he will think it is quite chilly weather since he is from another part of the world.. even to chilly to walk in the city streets (more if it snows~)  Hey ! I know he loves the snow so he won't mind if it does. Yet again it's my chance to snuggle him. A kiss should surely warm us. Just hope he won't burn up ~ ohoho ^o^ For some reason I can see how he would dress for this weather...*giggles* It's so cute! *wishes he was here to hug and never let go* And seems he is always wearing some kind of baggy pants which is a great match for his large/ baggy shirt. Don't know about the jacket though .. never seen him wear a winter jacket. I will have to ask him.  Gosh.. all these thoughts are silly to some people. I just hope I can have these experiences with him one day~  我非常想念他   Well I will go now .. so see ya ^^/" - alei  (song) *Love* by : Escaflowne  If you find a way to love Can you see and stay to love        In a sign called countlessness       Sketch the keys to you       Reaching for a post       Where one loves the most        As we learn in different ways       Free so dreams come true       Searching for a style       Care without denial        What we say despite of love       Collide into self-retreat       Can't we see that love can be       Something so precious       To cherish and hold and then  In so many ways to love If we realize its love In so many ways to love If we realize its love         If you see ignite in love       So far to reach above       Can't you see that love can be       Something so precious       To cherish and hold and then       (...something so precious       to cherish and hold and then)  All so many ways of love Can we compromise true love It's those funny things in love In our only way we love      * Our love so precious       True love is to cherish       Our love so precious       True love is to cherish      * repeat

Me and Rinn rushed home because we had to go shopping for Christmas still ^^: haha~ When I arrived home I met my guest who was staying for the break~ He is my sister and mines Pen pal ^_^ So anyways, I was introduced to him and then I rushed out to shop > When I came back from the mall I talked lots with Hide ( The guest at my house ^.^ ) and then around dinner Akira brought some Sushi from his store ^__^ It was the best ! Later that night .. heh heh heh ~ Well I won't say but I ended up dancing to Gekiai with Eden XD haha ~ Even Hide was dancing !!! " Eden! His head is shaking!!! hahaha~ " After my house we went to Eden's and played video games and so on ~   (Dec.20, 2003) Today I went to play pool with all my friends ^_^ It was much fun, but I lost cause me and Eden were facing each other and we were running out of time >. *Blushes* Hmm... I was kinda confused at one point about something.. but I now know why !! ^_^  Another good thing was I gave a card to my friend at school for Christmas and he said my drawings were good ^..^ Hehehehehehehe ~   (Dec.21, 2003) Today I went downtown with Jyan, Akira and Hide~ We went to meet one of our friends ^^ We went to the Future Shop and Akira had bought me another Christmas present ^o^v ( Which now is Chaos Legion ) Also, Hide had been talking more now ^^ Not so shy anymore ^__^ Same with me~    (Dec.22, 2003) This day was very fun!! Also cute ^^ At night me, Jyan, Hide, Rinn and Eden went to VanDusen Garden for the Christmas display~ ^_^ It was so beautiful! This was the first time I had tried eating Chestnuts. They were good ^^v It was very cold that night as well O.O One part of the gardens there was mistletoe and me and Hide walked under it~ We all had to explain what mistletoe was to him, but I never kissed him. Later that night I became sick >.  (Dec.24, 2003) Christmas Eve!!!! \^o^/ MO FO WA ! I went last minute shopping with Eden ^^; eh heh heh~ I thought I seen someone I know.. God.. I am stupid to think it is him~  Anyways, I stayed home that night and watched a movie my Dad had put on. IT WAS SO BORING! No wonder Hide feel asleep in the middle of it. I was feeling my eyes getting heavy as well XD  Hmm.. doesn’t even feel like Christmas! >  (Dec.25, 2003) CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I got lots of things I wanted ^^ I even got KinKi Kids DVD ^O^ *Thanks Hide!!* Later that night my relatives came and even Takao came~ It is lots of fun ^^v But, I think I ate too much ^^; haha~ I even got Hide to play videogames! Haha~ Tekken Bowl XD   (Dec.26,2003) Boxing Day~~~~~ Umm.. I didn't really do that much today, but when it was getting late Jyan decided to have her own little fun ( I guess ) haha ~ As for me, this was a very interesting and enjoyable night ^_^ Me and Hide talked for 3 1/2 hours ! It was great! We talked about everything~ I really hope I can experience this again someday ^.^ ( What am I talking about ??!! Of course I can XD 3 月 !!! )   (Dec.27,2003) Today Rinn, Sady, Hide, Adam and me went iceskating !!! It was very fun! Well that is cause I didn't do it for some time ^^' hehehe~ But I didn't fall. ^_^v Poor Hide~ He fell lots of times >.  (Dec.29,2003) Went to my eldest sisters house with Rinn and we spent the night. Man... Raz was reading this stupid jokes book XD haha~ Some jokes were really sad, but we all still laughed ^^   (Dec.30,2003) Today It snowed !!! Yeah ! I love the snow ^O^ *waves flags that read "S-N-O-W!"* Did I go out in it ? No way ! I don't want to freeze my ass off XD haha~ I mean, I love the snow... but today I didn't want to go in it ^^" Also, today I was put through hell when Jyan showed Hide some videos ( The old ones ... of me ) God.. I was so ashamed -o-'  Eden came over cause we were thinking of plans for New Years~ And I cryed >  (Dec.31,2003) New Years Eve ^^ Hehe~ Tonight we went to Adam's house for the celebration. And it is still snowing out! What a day ! Great Day ♪~~~~ We started the night with talking, drinking and eating... I am still amazed that I danced to " Gekiai Merry Go Round " infront of everyone ^^: haha~ And the bad thing is that Jyan taped it !!! O_O I am scared for life ! *dies* haha ~  When the Big 12:00 came everyone ran outside and yelled "HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!♪♪" And Takao's famous " Dynasty Warriors!!!! " I love that pic XD It is still my fav pic! But, I am still not sure why Takao ripped his shirt off in the cold weather ^^' haha~ O well..  (Jan.1,2004) The 1st day of a new year ! I feel kind of sick today... in the stomach TOT I think it is from too much drink lastnight ~ Well I cooked today for me, Jyan and Hide ^^ I am glad everyone liked it~ And my saying about cooking.. maybe I broke it, maybe I didn't~ I played DDR today after a long time and Hide tryed ^^ He was pretty good for a first time player! This was another intresting night ^^ Talked about life~   (Jan.2,2003) Today Hide went to Victoria so in my "nothing-to-do-ness" I baked some muffins ! They turned out great! hehe~ (Not to brag and hopefully not to curse myself~)   (Jan.3,2003) Went to Downtown with Eden. It was soooooooo cold! We went by English Bay and froze our buns off XD haha ~ After I went to Eden's for dinner~ It was good ^^   (Jan.4,2003) Today Hide came back from Victoria and we went to the mall and got print club cards !!! It is really cute ! Maybe some people seen it on my MSN ^^  While at the mall we also went to the Starbucks there ~ Nice talking! The scary thing was a song came on that I recongnize very well... It was sent to me so long ago .. so I thought maybe since of the time now it was a sign .. ^^ It ws kind of like a thing I wanted to do .. well ..never mind. It is just my stupid thinking ^-^ hehe~   (Jan.5,2004) Back to school for me .. sucks ! But I don't have to go to school tomorrow cause I am going to take Hide to the airport... hmm.. I don't want tomorrow to come. Even Hide told me the same thing. There is a snowfall warning. Starts at 5 am and goes the whole day... We both want this warning to come true. We tryed our best to stay awake and have a really good night, but well... the tiredness of previous nights must have cought up to us.. Shit! Still it was an ok night ^^ Nice a relaxing I guess..   (Jan.6,2003) I didn't sleep untill 4:30 am and I kept looking outside for the snow to come.. it didn't come untill 8 am !!! I was so angry !!!! >___  When we were finally there and I had to say my good-bye I was a really upset, but I didn't cry~ When I got home I stayed in my room for a long time and just listened to some quite music and stared out my window watching the snow fall slowy in the street....
