       there are a lot of things that a man or a woman might want to say but cannot say them, there are various reasons why they are able to say them or not. however there is one thing any man or woman should easily be able to say, the word that comes to your mind when you accidently kick your bedpost with your knee or toe. Especially the toe, kick it just hard enough that a little bit of the nail is left attached to the more ably attached part of the anatomy. now after you wake up from your personal blackout you find out which condition your nail is in. for women it might be a consolation that they broke a nail and at least it wasnt one from the two hands. there isnt a third hand, if there were it would only spell more long nails and a higher consumption of nail polish and nail polish remover and other related items of use to women, cross dressing men, transvestites and other people who use nail polish (little kids who want to differentiate MY MUG from MY SISTERS MUG.  is nail polish, Polish? i guess i will never find out. or is simple polish, Polish? was polish used for the first time in Poland or did a Pole use it for the first time. if a Pole used it for the first time, who helped it? i mean, how can a POLE paint its own self. if it could paint would it let the Dog destroy it by raising one leg and doing it? which reminds me of the freedom Dogs and cats and other such animals have. They can just go ahead and do it. especially the stray ones. we have so many double standards. Our pets are more free to do what they wanna do they we are. more over they are fed and we have to kill and eat (that might be one of the ways to define working for a large organiation). for every job you get, some ten people dont, or maybe more. so should we consider ourselves lucky? or just plain stupid? or undemocratic (since we are doing something that the majority aint doin?) or cruel cause we disallow someone from taking a job and going back broken hearted or hungry or somehting like that?

       If you should die before me, ask if you could bring a friend 					 (Stone Temple Pilots)    An innuendo is an insinuation (and or an implication or suggestion).  Life is full of little innuendos, it at times seems to be built of these little one liners that people keep dishing out as if they are home grown in their back yard or back lawn or what ever those things with grass and other weeds is called. Turns out most of them are from forwards and other kinds of emails that these people send and receive over a period of time. Johnny was a little boy; Johnny was a happy little boy until he started receiving these forwards. He now is a big boy; he is a big boy because he hates, and hate, like love is an extreme emotion. Johnny hates these forwards and every other thing that these forwards accompany.   	 Diarrhea is an innuendo.  It is an innuendo because it is tells you what you have done (Implication of), and it definitely TELLS you what you have to do in the very near future (Suggestion). It plays with one’s mind, wages psychological warfare on the mind, body and soul of the victim. Almost all of us have gone through it at least once in our lives. Anyone who is old enough to get to this web page has frolicked with it once. It is a beautiful thing; it reminds you of how nice and serene the world is. It is more powerful than love OR making love. It leaves your knees wobbly like you had just laid eyes or hands on the most cherished of your possessions. The love of your lives may not bring that effect that diarrhea brings with it. Ignore what you consider discomfort; the rose would never ever be so beautiful had it not been for the thorns.   It all started with a bit of pizza, a bit of fun and a bit of soft drink. The bit became a bit more than the digestive system could handle independently. Maybe it didn’t like the taste of the pizza. I did enjoy the pizza thoroughly but the after math was not a sight to enjoy, not something to write home about.   It is strange, for someone like I , who enjoys a cup of tea while taking a dump it shouldn’t have been THAT gory, but the way I felt, it seemed as if I was ravaged by a creature come up from the dark pits of the universe, something out of a Stephen King book.   The darkness of the night, it was a cool night, cooler in comparison with the previous three weeks of blistering heat. The skies had opened up and the clouds wept with embarrassment as if they already knew what was about to befall my poor self. The wind whined out side, hitting the house with considerable anger, lightning crashing brings occasional sparks of light to the otherwise dark night. I slept unawares, enjoying the cool wind swirling down from my new ROYAL FAN (after having bought it was I told that you may NOT get Amina Haq with it, she only appears in the advertisement does not jump out of the box, I do not like her particularly but having her around wouldn’t have been bad at all). How? Oh how could it have occurred to naïve old me about how my life was going to change forever?   It was a lesson in relativity. Sharp pangs followed by even sharper ones, cramping in the abdominal/lower abdominal area, spasms in the lower back. It all felt familiar, as if I had heard about it somewhere. I feared the worst; I thought that it was a curse. The utter obsession with the opposite sex had at last come back to haunt me in the worst of manners possible. On the other hand I would be notoriously famous as the first man to ever have a menstrual experience, and since I was a man it meant I had no experience what so ever.   I was sure things were changing and that I would soon be a beautiful woman and go out and haunt the innocent city dwellers like in the stories only I would be Dr. Jekyll and Miss Hydi!. Just to be sure I gave my self a thorough anatomical examination, with the kind of pain I was in I felt like Rambo sewing himself in First Blood. The result was a negative (which in medical terms means good). I am sure that long time back a doctor gave a patient some test and when they came through, the doctor in all his wicked humor teased the patient saying the tests had been negative. This led to the patient swooning and nearing death, due to which the high humored doctor lied about how negative, was good in medical sciences. I am so sure about such stuff that it is scary. Throughout this pain and confusion I was wondering that if it really happened and what with the recent negative tests, it would happen with my anatomy not supporting the correct accessories to go through painlessly with the experience. This thought sent a fresh shipment of ice shards down my lonely spine column. I knew I would scream, and I was wondering how I would feel and look like while screaming like a girl caught in a Hollywood horror / slasher flick???……..

       You are standing on the sidelines, thinking, should i or should'nt i. and then you take that one fatal step. You step out of the beautifully air conditioned office, who cares if the office is decorated worth shit, it has air conditioners. They help you breath. You dont feel the gratitude while sitting in the office. Something hits your face like a hammer. you dont feel much, you cannot. The hair all over you body starts to burn and curl up as if you are standing in an inferno. It most definitely is HOT out there, but please pay no heed to mr. Nelly. Do not, i repeat DO NOT take off all or any of your clothes. You will only die of exposure. The other option is slow death, at the hands of the heat. A man thinks what hell would be like. The sweat your body gives off to keep you cool evaporates even before the glands can push any out. The realisation that you have got NO CAR dawns upon you with the heat of a thousand suns, you cease wondering and start trudging towards the nearest shade, only to find it occupied by enough people the body heat of those people could start a bush fire of its own if they were let loose in the bush. cant start a bush fire without a bush now can we. Amidst this chaos that reigns supreme in one's mind, one realises that one has been talking to one's ownself in the third person. "Man it is hot today, i think you should buy a car now, cant go on like this for long, cant go even a furlong anymore". however in all this gloom, all the stupid idiomatic dark clouds that just arent there at that time, there is a silver lining. Women!  we happened to leave a client's office right next to liberty market, at about 1.30 pm, high noonish, sun was at its playful best. brows tightened and creased, cheeks reddened with anger, frustration, flustered by the sudden onslaught of amazing nuclear fusion fueled heat, eyes sightless, ears drumming with the last sounds of blood rushing past the tympanic membrane. Tounge stuck to the top of your mouth, no saliva there baby. And that was when we layed our eyes on God's greatest creation to date, WOMAN. All this confusion and there they were, in all calm like little secluded lakes. All of them, out SHOPPING at a time when even the shop owners were reluctant to sell. They were having the time of their lives. Laughing, cheering about how they got the best price possible cause the shopkeeper was too dehydrated to resist their battering. The heat seemed to simply bounce off of them, how can a man resist such strenght and beauty, and intelligence. to come out to do something that you like at a time when you like, at a time that the opponent is at his weakest. The women all over this city are natural generals, right ful heirs to San Tzu and his art of war theories. At a time when all is bad, hair is burnt, cars over heat, air conditioners give up, roads crack, the ladies can put on make up, wear stilletos and walk the walk and talk the talk. Bah! chauvanist fools! Man's world, just beware all corporate people and other important fools, just beware of the day when a woman finally decides that she has shopped enough for the day, that will be the last day you sit in your plush sofa behind your mahogany desk pushing your expensive pen. it will be the revolutionary day of the much awaited coup, and your thrones will be slid from right under you. The only problem that might arise from all this is, that as soon as she takes over the office, she would want to shop again, you have to do something about the decoration you know, it looks like rat lived in here for a thousand years! and frankly cant have any doubt about the rat part anyways.

       You know it  Just the way I told it We spent our lives dreaming To see a rose blooming Only to know it is screaming And we long to leave this place To go to some afar in space Alone, no one near us  Expression that comes itself It is evident is not forthcoming Forced acceptance akin to denial Self torture mass suicide Of our nonchalant existence Let us put as much distance between us and sanity Taste of tears and smell of my fears The sea, its breeze and its salinity  All that is pretty  All that is dainty So full of hate So much love for pity Yes I am alone here Said my prayers, seen the end is near I want to go there Alone or with you Life, it needs a shove and a push  I’ve done with love,  Done with out being sorry For the loss of one, when all is gone And till the drowning of the sun  I’ve said my prayers,  Said them for life Been on my knees Been there for you When you were there and now When you are gone  I’ve said my prayers With the rising sun And till it drowns Am tired now, will leave Alone and without you To hell where my life has gone And come back with the rising sun The day it doesn’t dawn On a day that will not drown

        SALAM, THIS IS GOING TO FIND YOU IN GOOD HEALTH, THAT I BELIEVE AND HAVE FAITH IN, CAUSE I HAVE FAITH IN THE ALLMIGHTY. THIS MAIL IS GOING TO BE IN CAPS,CAUSE I AM NOT GOING TO TYPE IT IN NORMAL FONT. THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING A CHOICE AND DESTINY. WHETHER THE FIRST STATEMENT IS TRUE OR NOT, I DO NOT KNOW, BUT I HOPE IT IS, BECAUSE I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER IT WHAT SO EVER, I DO HAVE A SEMBLANCE OF CONTROL OVER THE FONT OF MY MAIL. SIMILARLY IN EVERY OTHER THING GOD HAS GIVEN US A CHOICE. I HAD A CHOICE, I COULD HAVE TURNED OFF THE TV, CHANGED THE CHANEL, PUT ON A MOVIE OF MY CHOICE. BUT I THOUGHT, HELL I BOUGHT THE MOVIE, AND NEVER WATCHED IT, IT IS ON THE CABLE, NOTHING MUCH TO DO, LET'S JUST WATCH IT, AND I DID. AMERICAN PSHYCO, IS A STYLISHLY CARVED, WELL EDITED, SHOCKING EXCURSION INTO THE NOT SO AVERAGE BUT OBSESSIVELY AMBITOUS MIND OF AN AMERICAN CORPORATE OFFICER. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE ANY INDIVIDUAL THOUGHT PROCESS, DO NOT WATCH IT. IT CAN PROVIDE PLEASURE AND A BIT OF INSIGHT, BUT DESPITE ITS LONG MONOLOGUES FROM THE MAIN CHARATER, IT IS NOTHING BUT A ROAD TRIP TO A COCAINE FUELED HELL. A VEHICLE TO FAME AND FORTUNE, TO BE DIFFERENT IS WHAT THE MOVIE TEAM HAS AIMED. IT IS OLD AND IS EQUALLY SHITTY. IF YOU COME ACROSS SOMEONE WHO LIKES THE MOVIE, PLEASE MAKE SURE ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT PERSON. IT IS NOT THAT THE PERSON IS A PSHYCO, BUT IT MIGHT GIVE YOU AN INSIGHT INTO WHAT SORT OF GREY MATTER HE POSSESSES. I HAVE ALWAYS ADVOCATED THAT ANYTHING RELATED TO AESTHETICS AND TASTES OF A PERSON ARE HIS OR HER INDIVIDUAL HOICES. NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY THAT YOU ARE WRONG IF YOU HAVE THE FLINTSTONES AS YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE. THE REASON COULD BE ANYTHING AS TO WHY YOU LIKE THAT PARTICULAR THING SO MUCH, WHY ONE THING APEALS TO ONE IS DIFFERENT AS COMPARED TO WHY IT APEALS TO ANOTHER. SOME PEOPLE WATCH A WHOLE MOVIE BECAUSE OF ONE CHARACTER, SOME FOR ALL OF EM, SOME FOR THE SOUNDTRACK, SOME OF TEH ENDING, SOME FOR THE CINEMATOGRAPHY AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. BUT YOU CANNOT SAY THEY ARE WRONG. NEITHER AM I SAYING THAT THE PERSON WHO LIKES THE MOVIE IS WRONG. ALL I AM SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD WATCH OUT IF HE LIKES THE MOVIE. I LIKE THE WAY IT WAS MADE, THE SINGULAR SHOCK IT DELIVERED TO ME WAS SUBTLE AND I REALISED THAT I HAD HAD ONE THE DAY AFTER WATCHING IT. HOWEVER WHAT EVER THE MOVIE ENTAILS IS NOT AT ALL GOOD NOR IS IT HEALTHY. MY RECOMMENDATION: READ THE BOOK IF YOU HAVE TO, BUT DONT WATCH THE MOVIE ON A FULL STOMACH. MY SOURCES TELL ME THAT THE UNEDITED VERSION CONTAINS ORIGINALLY EDITED SCENES OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE.  			REGARDS                      D

       Same was with my dearest of friends; he lived for his love affairs, with this world and its atmosphere, the narrow streets in large cities, and big highways in small countries, made in imitation of those in more modern and advanced civilizations. To him controversy was a way of life, the essence of what his existence meant, and even in love denial for him was ultimate. Loving some thing, and not being able to get it, to fight the desire and the wantonness, everything that was, had to have an opposite. For him at least, but not for me, his belief that everything that is must have a balancing effect, that if there were too much good in this world and no evil, this world would collapse, implode, unable to digest all the sweetness that was encaged in the tiny hemisphere. To him evil was necessary for good to exist.  That made it easy for him to understand the extent to which some people went to have their way, but for all the philosophy and the big words that were even banished from modern dictionaries, he was a romantic to the core. His constant failures to deny love, and acknowledge hate as the only true emotion in this world were invisible to his own eyes, yet surrounded him every where he went. This time, he was truly caught, for never before had he been bewitched by one of the opposite sex, the worst trap any romantic can fall into, true love mixed with a dash of denial and topped with lack of guts to go up to the person and say out loud what he felt.  The reason behind his newfound lack in confidence was that he had never loved something alive before this incident, something that has a choice and may say no when you said yes. He was trying to cover it up unsuccessfully, by saying that the extent to which he loved this woman, had to be balanced by her hating him, just as much as he hated himself for loving her or just as much as he loved her, which was by and large in the same ratio. The least he could do to maintain balance for the sake of the world was to make sure that she at least didn’t love him. That was as far as his hypocrisy went, he couldn’t make himself imagine being hated by his true love. That was a minor development in his otherwise unchangeable character. I had a feeling the next few months would bring about many changes in a terrain where change was a stranger. Hassan, that is my friend’s name, thought that if he made her love him he would be part of another person’s dilemma. That some evil might befall another man, or animal for all the happiness he would be enjoying. Unbelievable to some, but true to a very large extent in Hassan’s mind which held nothing much in regard to opinions, and that too was usually borrowed from other people’s high headed discussions.....(continued)

       Most common people who tend to consider themselves normal because they follow the norms of society and find it easy to relate to other people around them, call dreamers as weak, strange weird and other one word and two word names that do not even begin to define the sort of people we really are. All this name-calling does not help our relation ship at all and only causes the rift between the drones, and us only to widen to an extent that it may never be bridged. At least not in our lifetime, mainly because people of our breed tend not to live very long lives, our average life span not withstanding we do try to eliminate the pain in our lives at the source of it, by foolishly eliminating life itself.  Contrary to what I am, I have tried to remain sober and true to life in the past ten minutes of story telling, but nothing that I say is a promise that the status quo would be maintained for any long period of time. However due to my new found reason to live, I can try to assure you that I will not take you for the ride of your life. This is not an original story, nothing man made in this world is original, and it cannot be, period. Why? Is a different issue for a different time and a different chapter, I cannot really promise that it will be pondered on either, maybe if I remember it, I will give forth my opinion on human beings and their delusions about being original. This is a story of tendrils of smoke, black lungs, more pin pricks in human flesh than a pincushion, your boss’s voodoo doll that you have hidden under your bed, and other stuff related to the downside of having more than your share of fun in one lifetime, not that you would remember anything the next morning.  Please bear with me as I iron out a few minor details, wrinkles in the bed sheet so to speak. You would know how it feels when you look at a painting that has been put up but has this ever so slight tilt to the right; you feel the need to put it right. If you cannot reach that painting, or it is in the dinning room of some one you have gone visiting, then through out your visit you find yourself looking up at the tilted picture as if it is a ritual until you can leave the place and embrace sanity away from the painting’s hung disposition.  Please remember that what ever follows has happened before, it is happening now somewhere in this smaller than it was once world and it will happen again unless human kind, either vanishes from the face of the earth in the brightest moment of the rock’s history, or if we manage to achieve the much dreamed about utopia. Only the vanishing part seems any likely and would also be very nice for the future of this planet and all chicken on it as well.    CHAPTER 1  “She is so beautiful” he moaned ever so balefully looking at me as if to gain some sympathy, or maybe he just looked as if he could do with some sympathy, whatever the confusion his condition though expected was not good at all. He lay sprawled on the leather-upholstered couch, one leg dangling so that his toe almost touched the Iranian rug, and the other foot; completing his designated pair, rested on a small stool. Light from the sinking sun filtered through the dirty window illuminating his face a bit, if not his brain.  It was pretty obvious that he was smitten with the girl he was talking about; at least it was a girl and not a car. Last time he came down like this with all his articulations drowning in his eternal undying love for HER, it turned out it was a classic car and he couldn’t get HER out of his mind for a minute. I felt cruel, considering his predicament was real and as serious as any other one sided love affair but it did not have much effect on me. Maybe because I had never been in his shoes, dainty as they were I tend to step lightly where daintiness is at hand. When it came to my thoughts about my friends and their continuous flirtations with love I was a nobody, a pure dyed in the wool outsider, who knew no bench mark to define or categorize the extent of seriousness in people’s emotions.   I merely looked at him as if he were an object in a museum, cold and beautiful, something you are not allowed to touch either. But despite all the rules and laws in the world, there are people who touch stuff in the museum and then there are people who steal them for which touching is a prerequisite. All of this happens for their vested interests, could be monetary or maybe touching the artifact just because it is forbidden, takes them to a high that nothing else in this world can. It can also be the selfish, obsessive and possessive nature of human beings, to capture and enslave something that you cherish, so that no one other than you can ever get near it see it taste it or breath it. Sometimes, it is just good to touch it, to know that it is there, that it exists; some things and some people are so beautiful, that you cannot imagine their existence until you have actually touched them. It is not necessary to touch them physically, an emotional connection, even a disagreement strong or weak can both lead to a co-existence of two different people, both feeding off each other’s presence, life blood without even knowing that the other person ever existed. Controversial statements but still very possible, you know another person is there, ever present, his or her existence felt in every other thing that you do or don’t but you never know who you do it for or how................(continued...)

       Not knowing where life was eventually going to lead, I marched on. A lone soldier amongst millions, no one to worry about, no sorrows, no tears, neither of sadness nor of joy. Life was a long railroad track along which I was swept, like a vagabond sail torn off some old ship ravaged by pirates. Life had no meaning, and even if it did it would have been really painful. It would be good if it continued and ended the same way. There would be the consolation of the thought that it was only something meaningless that had ended. Something that meant nothing to anyone, not even death itself thought much of this mockery, a character whose job was to mimic life. The greatest thing about being what I am is that you can be anyone you want, anyone you wish, anyone you look up to, dream to be, dread to be. Your best and your worst nightmares are at your doorstep; all but a single knock away.  You didn’t even have to close your eyes, and you could be in dreamland. Even if there were an Alice and her fabled wonderland, I had it beat by such a long margin that if she knew she would beg me to let her play. I can be your Knight in the shiniest armor, the last hope for planet earth. Make me your friend and I will be the Huckleberry Finn for you that Tom Sawyer never ever had. But in reality, I was nothing but a mere daydreamer, a man who had promised a lot, shown the potential of being the genuine article. The prodigious child that every teacher dreamed of having for a student but never got. No, this is not where I daydream, this is where I reminiscence, this is how it all started. The tiny seed that got planted by innocent onlookers, watered by unwitting patrons and my ludicrous imagination which later grew into a thousand-year-old rain forest of hopes; rotten to the root and unable to bear fruit for any creation on this planet. The infection seemingly benign and common had seeped in so bad that not even vultures would have a piece of this cake. Self pity? You couldn’t possibly know what the word meant, no one could, and frankly I don’t think I will ever know what it really means. I have never shed tears for my self nor felt anything much while shedding them for others in pain. Only the tears roll down when I dream of saving some one in pain and come out all painted in glory. Life has always found a way to get around hardships and give the tiring mind a rest; those are some of the excuses that a man or a woman who wished to dream his troubles away would give, to dream. To run so far away from reality that the taint of society cannot possibly find a way to reach them, hidden in their little hidey-holes where they themselves are only just comfortable. The comfort spawned from the thought that they reside in a place where no one else would ever feel comfortable enough to stay for long and disturb their sleep.

       We didn’t have much to do; hell there wasn’t much we could do. The sky was totally unapproachable, thick clouds and occasional whiff of mist stood its ground between our sight and the speckled blanket enveloping our universe. The sky isn’t really there, it is just something we underachievers talk about reaching knowing we cannot cause it just isn’t there. Space without sunlight is what it is. It was really quite beautiful there, in its gloom and tiny noises of snow falling off the tall pines that surrounded us. Every now and then one of them would shudder as if they couldn’t handle the weight of snow on their shoulders. I could most definitely relate with the thought, I don’t know whether the rest could or not, but I tried to be honest, knowing my limitations and I knew that I could never come close to encroaching them. The clouds overhead rumbled as if brooding, whether they wanted to shed more snowy tears over this valley of fear and suppressed human emotions or not. No one actually knew how long we had waited there in the cold darkness. Huddled together like a fresh dog litter trying to stave off the cold, willing it away. It burned it was so cold, went through the pores in our skin and even the adrenaline induced sweat seemed to freeze in the glands, however the tears never stopped flowing. Warm flowing salt kept making steamy streaky tracks along some quivering whitened faces as if some skiers had had a day full of fun and frolic in the alps. Cynicism aside life could get worse, the thought of being dead was a blessing now, it might have been worse if i had wanted to stay alive, especially after what I had seen people go through. Painful is what having a heart is, does not allow you to feel pain for yourself, if you see others in worst. Would have been better off had I seen only with my eyes and nothing else. I got involved, biggest mistake I ever made in my entire life, I had always been a bystander sometimes enjoying but always observing what happened around me. Observing yes, but only objectively, no emotions involved what so ever. There was never a need to do so, I was so right, I have always hated being right and I was when I thought that to stay aloof, away, the heir to the throne in introvertism; if there is such an ism, would be near to perfect. Nothing really can be perfect, but one thing is for sure. No one human being can stay away from humanity for long; every man is an animal, part of a society. Some sort of an emotion always creeps through let it be good-natured or bad there is always an underlying current of emotions. I don’t think us humans are deserving of so much nor can one man or woman bear so much pain or hate love, distress ...there aren’t enough shades of gray to cover the feelings and emotional ebb and flow that one might go through in one micro second."

       Twisted thoughts flowing Sleeping they were, Don’t know what gave them wings Shame, embarrassment, lies and deceit Head in knees The little boy is crying His soul is dying With every word that is said Between every line Leave it all behind Refuse to resign Ourselves to truth that drowns inside Forever gone innocence Slipping like tears All shame and fears Stripped of garb and cloth Naked flesh, strutting the streets Flushed with egos The sea is rising  To meet the moon Spell it out, it reads soon The tide is high But its only noon The little boy cries, Singing with his soul She leaves him now The sun is cold A mother wishing his hunger away Not knowing what hurts so She such a fool You can’t get what you wish for It never works that way We get what we deserve The devil sings as he may The sun shall rise On someone’s day Tears will fall Where someone’s love once lay They all still lie Waiting to die Thinking, of days gone by When the young were shy Some would laugh, while some would lie For every lie, someone would die The moon wept, seas rose high The world grows cold And the sky just dies The little boy cries His mother to him lies Wait a bit longer Dinner just arrives Let the kid sleep, she begs Deep,  Somewhere deep Where every dream dies, where he is not alone Where every one cries

       Hassan was a man; that was the least that could be said about him, and something that cannot be said about many of the gender but not of character, walking around on this planet at the same point in time and space. He was a man of his and other people’s word, some one who had never had to work, by choice or by compulsion. He wasn’t in habit of whimpering for everything he wanted or desired, even though most of what he wanted he could have, at least the material wished could easily be fulfilled with what his family had. There was a time when he fell in love with the Alps, wanted them to be available to him in his city, which was half a planet across. Of course such foolish wishes are not readily granted. He could have had it, provided he shifted there himself, but he didn’t, he wanted the alps to be in his back yard and no one could take the right to wish away from him. He wasn’t deliberately eager to please other people, he was just that way, and he was an earnest person who went whichever way you wanted him to. Maybe because at times he never had a direction in his own mind to go in, he was the kind of guy who would blindly go where no man or woman would go before him. For thousands of years man has evolved; born, grown, failed and succeeded, built pyramids which are effectively the most elaborate houses of the dead and nothing more but mere graves. Awe inspiring to some but nothing more than mere graves, signifying only one fatal reality; death. To Hassan that was pretty much a decent thought and I agreed, but I still thought that the pyramids if not a wonder were very well constructed buildings. You could make them palaces or shelter homes, but we humans are so intent of preservation of the past that we seem to forget the present. Every year millions are spent on rejuvenation of pre-historic artifacts but it is never thought that while we preserve our history we lose a bit of humanity, as it exists now. None of us ever stop to think why the pyramids effectively glorious graves stand yet we struggle to find the remains of the magnificent palaces that existed with them. Why has time preserved tombs instead of glorious palaces, why do we persist on calling the houses of the dead the glory of the past yet fail to see that the glory is past, and does not exist anymore than the dead lying in the graves they built for themselves. Something to do with cherishing what is past or could not transpire, same with the first love of everyone’s life, whether you get it or not, whether you lose or gain from it, thoughts of it follow you even through darkness, through places where your shadow leaves your wake.

       I have a little problem…. I have a demon for a wife He delights in my pretty face And he hates my life Takes notes on how to provoke past grief Makes my teeth decay, with the last of my self belief 				(Addicted-Faithless)    A time when you feel the need to say something the most is the time when you should say nothing at all. Easier said than done I’d say, climb up a flagpole and kiss your own arse is what I say. I say a lot, but realize only later that most of what I say is a bloody figment of my imagination. Never get around to actually saying it. I am sure; that had I said what I had wanted to, when I wanted to, things would have been totally different. I would be lying somewhere, oblivious of this pain, oblivious of the world’s sorrows and stuff, lying somewhere in my total decapitated solitude. My head separated from my body, would still be dreaming and talking though. But that is just a vision I have, I don’t think it is going to materialize. I really hope it doesn’t.  Evil dead is a movie I have seen many times. The scene where the girl sits in the window, telling cards true to the last color wrapped in her little blanket fresh from being raped by a tree and its branches, makes me think, is it dangerous to wander off in a jungle at night alone for a cute looking girl because of:  a)	The evil spirit haunting the jungle b)	The sexually frustrated trees c)	The trees possessed by a sexually frustrated evil spirit d)	The sexually frustrated men masquerading as trees e)	The sexually frustrated men brought up by apes and who now call themselves Tarzan f)	The Apes who brought up Tarzan and now want the real shit g)	The Female Ape who brought up Tarzan, now hates Karchak wants to try another flavor? h)	The sexually frustrated Lesbian Women, Cross dressing as men because that is the most believable disguise (even if a woman rapes another woman, the rape`e would assume that the rape`or was a man because only men are so frustrated so as to impose themselves on unassuming women running topless in an evil infested jungle in the middle of the haunted night).   There could be some other reasons as well, but what I really want to ponder upon here is not how a woman gets raped, even though for some that would be the best part (bloody perverts), I am rather interested in why women get raped while frolicking in the jungle, naked, in the middle of the night. When a man teases a woman (eve teasing I suppose). It is not appreciated by the feminine self-esteem at all. The ass pinching, and breast staring really hurts the feelings, and rightly so, It is unnatural, goes against the nature of mankind, but at the same time conforms with the nature of man, because that is what we do, attack and pillage and rape the poor lil bastard who cannot defend his or her own self.   So if men teasing women is unnatural, then women teasing men should be perfectly natural. All women should tease men, grab asses where ever they see a cute one, stare at crotches, push and shove in trains and buses, fight with friends in loud voices as to who gets to sit with the nice looking guy sitting alone in the back seat. Drop a hankie and ask if he dropped it and then ask if he wants to have sex, or just ask if he wants to have sex, forget the hankie (men like the bloody direct approach) after all, it is only natural!!!!
