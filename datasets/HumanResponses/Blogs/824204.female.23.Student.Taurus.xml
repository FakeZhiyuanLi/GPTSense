      So I have insomnia, or maybe I'm just having a weird sleep pattern....                     its been a while since I have posted anything on a blog... I used to post in Xanga, but uh I don't like it too much there because of.. uh what's a good excuse?  Well I don't have one! Oh I know... I can't afford the premium service and so my page looks like hell! Yeah...That's it! At least here, I have some excuse, that maybe I just want things simple and ordinary, just ONE advertisement and no calendar..  Ahuh Works for me!   It's 5:30 AM and I have yet to find sleep I wonder why?  Whoever you are that's thinking of me... STOP IT!!  My thoughts are really scattered right now because of the lack of sleep, lately its been that way!  Is it true that you contentment and happiness work hand in hand?  HMmM I wonder...

       sleep little angel......   I slept for 13 hours..... damn I feel refreshed... I'm ready to go out there and tackle the world and do great things like.... my laundry for example!!  My laundry has piled up so high I can barely look over it, well I'm only 5'2 but imagine that!!??? Can you imagine it!?  I wish I had a little friend who does nothing but do the laundry, like one of those little dwarfs or elves in the Filipino fables who does things for you while you're asleep or when you're not looking.. Yeah.. I want one of those.. then again.. I'm delusional so who cares right?  *little friend little friend... won't you do my laundry* if only......   Speaking of friends... not to sound like I'm advertising... but you need to try FRIENDSTER... it's awesome!! I can't believe I'm reconnecting with people I haven't heard from or seen in such a long time.. makes one realize how small the world really is when it comes to the internet! Of course reconnecting with people from your past means also bringing the past back... well at least in your head.. you think about the "GOOD OLD DAYS"  if they were any good that is... and then you think of your past relationships all those failed friendships and such.. ITS DEPRESSING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *counting 1...2...3* Ok I'm calm again.. Well gotta face the world and do my laundry.. so til next time..........

      Funny......   Right now, I'm really not in a right state of mind...   How does one go from having a wonderful, maybe not perfect but almost harmonious relationship to that of something I can't even begin to describe...   It's funny how you think you know someone and then you find out that you really don't.  It's funny when you think about the past.. you still smile at how things used to be even though your heart is breaking and your tears are falling.   It's funny how you go from one relationship full of lies just to end up in a worse one with even bigger lies and deception..   It's funny how you would stand up for someone and have them stab you in the back and then act like it's all good.. like they didn't do anything wrong...  It's funny how you can make love with someone when all along... it's just sex..   You feelin me yet?  It's funny how I use the word funny and I'm not laughing...

      You know that feeling you get when you've just been through a crisis and came out on top???...............   Yeah that just about describes my feeling right now.  I've come to figure out some things.   I figured out that you can't change the way you feel, but you can do something to make things feel better.   I figured out that HOPE will make some of the hurt go away. I figured out that GOODBYE doesn't mean always means ENDING.. sometimes its the BEGINNING. I figured out that LIFE GOES on... no matter what happens it has to go on.   The most significant thing is that PEOPLE change.. sometimes its for the better sometimes it for the worse.. but they change.. I'm HOPING one day YOU will change so that our ENDING can mark the BEGINNING and our life can go on.    I will love you always.

      Many would say that the worst thing is losing someone you really love because its your fault.. because you have done something wrong.  But what about if you lost someone you really love and it was THEIR fault?  Wouldn't that be even worse on you?   When that happens.. how do you move on?  How do you say ITS OVER.. when all your heart want and need is someone you can't be with?   You know they're wrong... EVERYONE KNOWS that he/she is wrong.... but you just can't accept it... You keep saying to yourself.. they didn't mean to.. they were just pressured or forced or they didn't have any other choice.  But the fact remains that as long as we are alive.. we have choices.. we can do either chose to do the right thing or chose the other path.    Yet you still cling to that reason of "being only human.. and being imperfect" to justify all the wrong that has happened.    Can anyone blame you for feeling the way you do?  My question still remains, how do you move on?  How can you tell yourself day in and day out that you can't possible love that person who has done such horrific things to you?    HOW????

      She used to say I can't picture myself not being with you... She used to say I'm her inspiration... She used to say she can't live her life without me... She used to say she's content knowing I'm in her life...  Now, She said she can't see herself being with me anymore... Now, She said I keep reminding her of her mistakes... Now, She said she can't live her life with me... and  Now, She said she can't move on if I'm in her life...  How does a person learn to accept that?  How does a person keep her/his self-dignity if its been crushed like that? How does a person learn to respect her/himself if the only person s/he's ever loved has said those things to her?    Everyone keeps saying LET IT GO... to just take the plunge and let go. They say that it would hurt for a while trying to get used to it... time heals all wounds.  But how can a wound so deep within your soul heal with time? Its hard when you have to smile or laugh and be hurting so much inside.  Its so hard to hide your tears and pretend as if everything is fine.  But for now that's all you can do.. hide and pretend.

      Enough of this depressing bullshit!! After reading my entries a few times, I wanted to clobber myself with a bat for all those crap I said. But I thought about it and I realized how much it would hurt to hit myself with a bat and so I decided to just cut the crap! How about that?  Is that ok?  ANYWAYS............  An interesting thought came to mind not too long ago.... read on!   (FYI: Its better to read this if you're picturing me as a redneck or just someone with a southern accent, I think that would make it more entertaining)  Not too long ago, I was drinkin' some of this here alcoohole-ic beverage while paintin' and sandin' in the garage when I noticed somethin' on my bottle of alcoohole.  I dunno if you folks ever drink **Mark's hard lemonade before.  But I shoooore did that night, cuz it gives you a nice little buzz after a bottle or two.  Anyhoo, there was this here message on it, you can call it a quote or whatever, for me it was just some writin' on a bottle. It said "If you're going to be original, you can count on being copied." Well hutttt damn! Ain't that just right on the bullseye there. (You can stop picturing me as a redneck or whatever). You'd think something like that would be coming out of some book of great quotes! Yet I found it really facinating that it came from a bottle of alcohol!! But isn't that true though?  That if you're going to be original, you'd just be copied by someone?  How many of us nowadays say or do something that we can really call OUR OWN THING? Not too many huh? How many of us put on clothing every day that is not inspired by someone or something? Do people who says they have their own style really do have their own style? Or are they just doing that so that they could say that their unique?  Is that true? Do they really have their own style? Or is it once again taken from an idea of someone outside of their knowledge? I'm not trying to say anything bad or judging people, so don't get all argumentative with me lol! It was just a thought! I do it myself, I can honestly say that I have no originality! If I analyze my whole life, I don't think I can recount a time when I didn't want to have something of another person or even be what someone is! If you tell me you've never.. you'll just be LYING to me and yourself!! Because we both know that that's bullshit! BTW, What does it even mean to be "ORIGINAL" or "UNIQUE" nowadays!????? Does it still have the same meaning from the dictionary when used to describe someone? Makes you wonder huh? Whoever said alcohol makes you stupid!!? LoL! It was just funny that something I read from an alcohol bottle would inspire such truth!   NOTE: ** Product name was changed due to legal reasons! LoL!

      FINALLY!!!!!!! I'm caught up with my school work!! Halelluia!!! God is Good!!!!   Here are the TOP 5 Reasons Why Filipinos Should've PLAYED Hobbits in Lord of the Rings  5. From the kneecaps down, Filipino men got some hairy-ass feet. I have cousins in the Philippines who still don't wear shoes, cause barefeet are more comfortable.   4. When it comes to gold rings, we might be the last ones on Earth to give them up. I have mean aunties who love to brag about their rings yet never show them to us...those greedy assho__s!   3. Having names like Bilbo, Frodo and Pippin ain't nothing to many of us who have uncles and aunties already named Beng Beng, Jun Jun, Alwin and Baby.   2. Having tall white men with their larger than life tales come to our lands to recruit us into fighting their wars is also nothing new. General McArthur/Gandalf....hmmm?, you tell me.   1. And many years after the One true ring is destroyed after so much death and sacrifice, Hobbits, like Filipinos, will probably never get their due Middle Earth War Veteran benefits.    LoL!!!!! I hope you enjoyed that.... If you want more just log onto www.rexnavarette.com and look for his top 5 archive!! This guy is sooooooo FUNNY!!!!!

      I have such a headache right now!! Although I know the source of it, and that is being awake at this hour! I'm loving and hating school right now.  I love the new stuff I'm learning, I just hate all the readings, quizzes, homeworks! The good thing is that I'm graduation soon! YEY, just a couple of semesters!! This time next year, one more sem! Gosh it seems soooooo far away! But they say it will go by really fast!   I hate pimples! Although I'm not the type to have any acne problems, I still get the occasional pimples, my face would feel so rough and weird! Yuck! Pimples sucks!   Sometimes, I don't understand why I am the way I am. My bestfriend moves to town and of course its expected that we become close again. But for some reason, I felt myself drifting further away.  Maybe its because of my situation at the time which includes a break up from a long term relationship, home construction, constant trip to and from home depot and the grocery store in the scorching weather, picking my mom up from work, being a driver for most of my family, my niece's birthday, and my own(which sucked BTW and ended in tears), my constant misery and of course school. But mostly, it was the break up that really affected me.  I expected her to at least understand my situation. I was dealing with my misery all on my own. I couldn't confide in anyone else. Of course I chose not to, because it was the only way I knew how to handle it. Plus, I didn't want to look like a fool.    The thing is I didn't even feel bad that I failed to be a good friend to her. Because I was hoping she should also understand where I'm coming from.  I kept thinking why couldn't she understand me!!!  I've noticed that ever since I came back here from New York, I've drifted from my former sociable self.  Maybe its the Vegas lifestyle that makes people anti-social, or maybe its the environment I'm in.  But when my bestfriend came to visit the 2nd time, so many things ticked me!! From then on, I felt like I'm not the same person anymore.  I often find little things that would make me mad so that I'll have a reason not to be close or to be the way I used to. I often find myself thinking that we barely have anything in common anymore and we have so much that separates us now.  I really don't know what's going on with me.  I'm not sure why I've changed so much.  I'm not sure if things will ever go back to the way it used to be between me and her. It saddens me, yet I'm not sure how to fix it or what to do about it. Do I have to be the one that needs to change or does she? Am I the problem or does she also have something to do with it?  Is it just me that changed or was it also her?  I'm not sure anymore! But I do know that this is a very big problem for me right now because it may cause the end of our friendship, and that's what I don't want to happen.

      Being single gives a girl lots of choices.  She can go on dates with any Jane, Dick, or Tom!!! Here's the problem (there's always a problem)... how do you act? I ask this because I haven't been in the "single scene" in a while.  So I'm not sure how the procedure goes anymore.  Here's another thing, when you start "talking" to someone... WHY DO THEY ASSUME that "KAYO NA?" Just wondering!! It's not enough that you send these SIGNALS.  Some people are just so thick headed that you have to GIVE them a hard hit on the head and say "SLOW DOWN, I just met you a day ago!" I mean come on, aren't there anymore "courting" involved anymore? No flowers? No chocolates? No love letters?  SHIT!! Is this what dating is in the 21st century!? It makes me want to become a hermit and dig a little hole and hide in my academia and just say F*ck it! LOL!! But I do love feeling wanted again! Its nice to know that there's someone who thinks you're attractive and makes sure you know it.  I'm so easy to please.. maybe that's the problem!! Yet, I find myself being really suspicious, like when someone says "I LIKE YOU" I think, WHY? does this person just want sex? or I think, Uh Oh.. HIDDEN AGENDA.. need to find out what it is..!! Is this normal? Funny... lately no Jane.. just lots of Tom and DICKS...!! I've forgotten how to flirt with a man... or even how to act around them.  SHIT!! I really do need an update... a refresher course so to speak! HELP ME!!

       Two&nbsp;Commandments I need to live by: (not from THE 10 commandments)    1- Thou shalt not miss what thou does not have.    2- Thou shalt not want what thou cannot have.    I kept repeating this over and over earlier as I stood by the water outside Treasure Island, and&nbsp; was thinking about so many things while listening to the gentle flap of water and feeling the humid breeze brush against my skin.     &nbsp;   I posted a new picture on Friendster..... just thought I'd share.     &nbsp;   I had such a blast this weekend!!! It was a weekend filled with dancing, hollering, hugging, kissing, meeting new people, music.... LOTS of music... alcohol...... LOTS of alcohol, heartbreak stories, tears, showers, "freaking," lap dancing, tube shots, singing in the car, singing in the house, food, friends, reminiscing, coughing, yosi jamming, yosi sharing, seeing old flames, seeing NEW flames, crushes, people watching, laughing........ LOTS of laughing!!!!!!! To sum it up.........I haven't had so much FUN in a long time!!!!!     &nbsp;   THANKS Kuya Jo, Ahlet, Sandy(*giggle*), CK(wazzupwazzup),&nbsp; JO "liit"(grrrr), and everyone I danced and boozed with this weekend!!! *MWAH*&nbsp;Mamaya (Sunday night) ulit.... if I finish my paper! Syet!!! Better get some ZzzZzzZzzz

       We had the right love at the wrong time.....       I'm okay, at least I think I am. Its just that, there would be times when my mind would drift and tears would slowly just start pouring down, and I'm not sure I should be feeling that way. I'm not sure if I'm still allowed to feel like that.        You know what sucks? That feeling when you KNOW someone is intentionally avoiding you, or doesn't want to see you. I've never really been in that situation, at least not when its done intentionally, until recently. It just hurts, to think that someone you used to spend everyday and every night with doesn't even want to look at you. Yet you can't help but see this person, even for just a moment. It is so hard to let go, its so hard to think that "the one I gave my heart to" has the power to make me feel so damn bad. It's only been a few months, yet I feel like this hurt I'm feeling is never gonna go away.       More than half of the time I would say that I'm really OKAY, but then there's those times at night when I sit in the dark and just start to cry.... I don't know why, sometimes I wish I wasn't so damn emotional!! It's such a fault! Nakakainis!

       Here I am... Playing with those memories again.     And Just when I thought time had set me free,      Those thoughts of you keep taunting me     Holding you.... a feeling I never outgrew   Though each and part of me has tried, only you can fill that space inside.    So there's no sense pretending, my heart... its not mending      Just when I thought I was over you,    And just when I thought I could stand on my own    Oh Baby, those memories come crashing through.   And I just can't, go on without..... you.       On my own I've tried to make the best of it alone   I've done everything to ease the pain, but only you can stop the rain.    I just can't live without you... I miss everything about you..       Just when I thought I was over you, And just when I thought I could stand on my own Oh Baby, those memories come crashing through. And I just can't, go on without..... you.       That song describes EVERYTHING I'm feeling right now, I'm confused and I feel stupid feeling things I shouldn't even be feeling. What's worse is that the one person I want to inform of this, can't know or maybe doesn't want to know. I don't know how to keep my pride intact anymore, at times it seems really important, and then again there would be those days when I just don't care. When I'm reminded of all the wrongs that's been done, I feel this surge of anger, but that just goes away when I think of the person that I KNEW. Its funny that I don't even care about all the fights, all the anger, all the "bad", all I care about is the TIMES we shared together. All the bad things that happened suddenly seem so petty. Sometimes, I wish I can just say what I feel and not have to feel bad or have to keep my pride!! But would anyone CARE? Would it make a difference? Will it turn back the hands of time? Will it bring anyone back in my life? No one, NO, NO and NO are the answers to those questions that I keep telling myself. If only that was enough to get rid of this loneliness taking over my being. Shit!Shit!Shit!DAMN!
