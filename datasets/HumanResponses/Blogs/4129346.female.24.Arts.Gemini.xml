      So at work I'm doing the work of two people. I have every Tom, Dick and Harry asking me status on projects,deadlines and let's not forget the occassional favor. Out of the things that I have going on, I forget one email to send. I say "I'm sorry I forgot" and I get "that's no excuse". At which point i get nasty and say "Give me a fucking break, I can't be everybody's bitch!" What the fuck is wrong with these people. I really shouldn't care as I will have new fucking problems soon enough. I'll be living in London in about 3 weeks and I'll be with out a job. God, that really scares the shit out of me. I have to get my but up tomorrow morning to help Tami move her stuff over from Brooklyn to my place in The Bronx. I"m glad she'll be taking the responsiblities of my apartment. It is such a godsend. However I'll be living with George (tami's boyfriend) in London. So I think it'll work out okay. I definatly need to get a job there as I don't want to over stay my welcome with him.  So.... Jonathan sends me a text today mentioning his new powerbook and how after he and his brother installed everything they realized the computer had a few kinks in it. I usually get excited to recieved texts from him but now I feel like I need to begin distancing myself from him. I feel it's the best thing for me. i can't afford to have feelings for some bloke in London who still batty over his ex-girlfriend and every other Latin Woman that cross's his path. I don't know what the fuck. Maybe I don't look Puerto Rican enough for him or something. The truth is when I'm around him he really doesn't make me feel like he's in to me. Like he's not interested in me as a person. I asked him if his ex, even after all the fucked up things she did to him would ask him back would he go? Jonathan said yes. I can't continue talking with someone who is not capable of feeling for me. At least I'm making an effort. Now i must find a way to tone it down with him. I know some may say. Fuck that niggar. But I'm not like that. I think I have a little more feeling for others even though they don't have the same regards for me.   Then there's Andrew (another fucking brit). At least I know where the fuck he's coming from. He's interested in sex with me. I won't lie, it wasn't that bad with him but that's all there is. When I am with him he does treat me like a queen. He draws a bath for me, cooks me dinner, goes on long walks through the forest with me. He even listens when i talk even though I know for a fact that I'm yapping too much and that what I'm talking about doesn't interest him that much. I think Jonathan just finds me (his words, not mine) amusing.  In the states when someone says something like that it usually means that you're there for the person's entertainment. Once again London English verses New York English. What the fuck are these people going on about.  Okay, I think I'm brit bashing. They're not all the same. There is one I'm going to keep secret for a while but I think I'll speak about him. When I first met him it was nothing big at all. It was very friendly. Actually I haven't met anyone as quick witted as he. Sometimes after a conversation with him i feel like i need to smoke a joint or something. Never met someone who can stimulate me mentally like he does. Out of everyone here, I think that he would hold his own fine with my family and friends. That's something that's really important to me. Culture wise, i think we're on simular pages also. Another plus for me. I know there's something there because I want to take it slow with him. I want to work on this friendship that has developed. I need to know if we could be friends before I move into lovers but we'll see. I'm a rash person who makes rash decisiosns. I'm working on the part of me that needs work. Patience. I'm going to reply to an email from him that looks like the begining of something. Of course it wouldn't be complete if we werent' humoruous with one another. That's what seems to be working right now. I'm gonna try to go with the flow. We'll see about that.

      Okay, I'm realizing that I'm missing Joe more than I led myself to believe. I was on the train this morning listening to Linkin Park (joe used to listen to them all the time) and I've finally started listening to the words of all of the songs and I realize that is how he probably how he felt being with me. The sad part is that is how I feel now. I wonder if he misses me the same way I miss him. I really miss his company when I did get it. Today I spoke to Jonathan and that guy is just as fucked up as I am regarding having feelings for an ex. What the fuck is my deal?!!? Why do I still talk to him? My initial instinct was "this guy is too good to be true" and it turns out my instinct was correct. He's still in love with his ex. I'd be a hypocrite if i couldn't be accepting of that because I believe that I'm still in love with joe. I mean Crap, I almost started balling on the train ride this morning on the way to work just thinking about us. I think that is why I continue talking to Jonathan. Do I deserve someone who's totally into me? yes i do, but it's unfair because I can't give myself fully to anyone else at the moment. Maybe that's why ( i can't speak for him) i feel we continue to amuse eachother. It must be a distraction on both ends. There's this Linkin Park song 'Somewhere I belong'. I think it sums up how I truly feel at this given moment.  "Somewhere I Belong"  (When this began) I had nothin' to say, And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me, (I was confused) And I'd let it all out to find, That I'm not the only person with these things in mind, (Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed, Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel, (Nothin' to lose) Just stuck, Hollow and alone, And the fault is my own And the fault is my own  I wanna heal, I wanna feel, What I thought was never real, I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long, (Erase all the pain 'til it's gone) I wanna heal, I wanna feel, Like I am close to something real, I wanna find something I've wanted all along, Somewhere I Belong,  And I've got nothin' to say, I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face, (I was confused) Lookin' everywhere, Only to find that it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind, (So what am I) What do I have but negativity, 'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me, (Nothin' to lose) Nothin' to gain, Hollow and alone, And the fault is my own And the fault is my own  I wanna heal, I wanna feel, What I thought was never real, I wanna let go of the pain I felt so long (Erase all the pain 'till it's gone) I wanna heal, I wanna feel, Like I am close to something real, I wanna find something I wanted all along Somewhere I Belong  I will never know, Myself until I do this on my own, And I will never feel, Anything else, until my wounds are healed, I will never be, Anything 'til I break away from me, And I will break away, I'll find myself today,  I wanna heal, I wanna feel, What I thought was never real, I wanna let go of the pain I felt so long, (Erase all the pain 'till it's gone) I wanna heal, I wanna feel, Like I am close to something real, I wanna find something I wanted all along, Somewhere I Belong  I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm Somewhere I Belong

      Okay so I'm sitting here trying to figure out what the fuck am I suppose to write. I mean, I've had a many things going on lately and it's almost impossible to just bring myself up to date. I'm still deciding whether or not I should share this with friends and family. I could use this as a way to rant as I know I'm good at this. People usually think it's a joke when I go off about things that piss me off. Trust me this is just the beginging. I'll always be angry at something. Oh and by the way I've just noticed that this thing doesnt even have spell check so it is expect quite often that there will be many spelling errors. Fuck it, why should I care, right?
