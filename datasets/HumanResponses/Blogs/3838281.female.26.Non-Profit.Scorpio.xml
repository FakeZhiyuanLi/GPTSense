      I've got great pictures to share tonight. Too lazy to do the Flickr thingy so I'll just ' HELLO ' them through. I've been clearing out old emails lately because I'll be moving on to a lovely cool lappie Ibook very soon and then it will be goodbye PC deskie! You've served me well, but I'll have to let you go. (To my trustee uncle's office!)   And so I browse me Inbox and came across an old email from a dear friend telling me about this magnificent place in Mexico called Costa Careyes. I opened up the attached pictures and was marvelled by such beauty. I remember making a silent decision that before I depart from this earth, I  HAVE  to visit this place. I don't know how I'm gonna get the moolla to pay for it but I'll just have to try. Here are the pics...You will be awed, I assure you. Enjoy!    urlLink     Sunset by the pool deck...    urlLink      The balcony area I presume...waaaaah..    urlLink     Breathtaking view...    urlLink     Can I so sleep here and look up at stars....ooh la la!    urlLink     "Take me there to the paradise city..."    urlLink     "Over the hills and far away..."

      In preparation for welcoming a new flattie, I've been diligently cleaning every spot and speck within the household for the past few nights.  Somehow the still of the night motivates me to do housework. Managed to clear out most of my junk in the " Wardrobe Unit " and now the main wing of the flat looks like a busy domestic cargo terminal. Or rather, Hurricane Andrew had just paid me a visit. Argh, I'm such a hoarder. Heh.  It's a reasonable space. So I think. Heh. It's Gracie's best bet after a few unsuccessful searches for a room. At least it will give her options to decide what she wants to do with her ' new ' life after Giles.  I will miss my lovely bathroom though, but no sweat. It's the least I could do for a friend. By the way, the gabster is not too pleased with her 'penthouse suites' above the wardrobe becoming NO ACCESS.  Scratch.    urlLink    There's a phat cat on my bag...

       ...like the first morning Blackbird has spoken, like the first bird Praise for the singing, praise for the morning Praise for the springing fresh from the word   Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven Like the first dewfall, on the first grass Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden Sprung in completeness where his feet pass  Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning Born of the one light, eden saw play Praise with elation, praise every morning God's recreation of the new day"   Songwriter must have been trippin. Just like me, the nocturnal owl of the industrial night. It's only ten past six before sunrise and somehow there is already hussle and bussle within the heartlands. Damn, these people wake up early...oh  but then again, that is the norm. I, on the other hand, belong to a 'unique' group of individuals who believe in  carpe diem  and once we've found a passion for something, time is NEVER a factor. Heh.  I can be totally engrossed in a newly purchased  urlLink gadget  and completely forget about time. Wanna make a guess? *wink* Ooh ers...it's just so lovely.  Haha..  It will probably take some time getting used to especially since I'm a raw convert. So exciting! :)  ANYWAY, I had a nice surprise phone call from two old friends last night. Their individual love lives were burdened with rocks, so they have been seeking refuge in each other as platonic mates. To me, RT and RL are Chinkapore's Ken and Barbie. Their faces don't exactly launch a thousand ships but among the masses here, they are the cream of the crop and at least they've got humble souls.  It was fun catchin up at the Khandahar Pitstop and having a fab hot choc. Love the breeze along Beach Road. Uncle Sarabat was having good business too. His  teh  rawks the hauz yo!  Haha.  Kicked some ass at the pool table. It's been a  looooooooong  time.   Sheet. First light of the day. The school group has awaken and I hear the wheels of the bus going round and round and round and round...*yawn* Ohayo.

       urlLink    Can you spot  urlLink Nemo ?  I SO miss  urlLink diving .  Sigh.  Just being out in the vast open sea... it's a whole new world out there. As if we're not awed enough by the beauty of nature on land, wait till you explore the one beneath the ocean.  Ooh...   I used to fear the dark deep waters. Perhaps it was watching too much 'Jaws' back in those days when the 3D screening freaked the shit outta me but I seriously had the phobia of getting my rear end chomped off by some god-forsaken numbskull beneath the water. Especially when visibility in our local surrounding waters is like on a serious  low  percentage.  Horrors .   Well,  urlLink wakeboarding  has definitely brought down that fear a little cuz I love being out there just popping wakes. And even if I fell, it was only a brief moment before the boat would turn back to pick me up. Then I would be up and about edging side to side and enjoying the scenery. Such is life...   urlLink    Atlantis Bay, Pulau Aur, M'sia....home away from home....  However, I took ages to pick up diving. Just the mere thought of descending into strange waters made the hairs on my arm stand on all ends. What if I come face to face with a big ass sharkie? ( note : this was when I was completely ignorant to find out what kind of marine life existed in our surrounding straits.  Bah.)  or enveloped by some maniac stingray?  Duh.    I forgot those questions as friends around me started picking up diving and hey,  they survived . So why in God's name was I so worried about? Perhaps my head might explode due to the pressure change as I advance into further depth or too much nitrogen from the tank would make me go insane...WHATEVER! So despite all these worries, I WENT for it eventually. And lo behold,  I LOVED IT!  So much that I'm craving for my next dive like a baby for milk. When will I ever get to go again? When can I see Nemo again?

       urlLink    All of God's creatures great and small... I love them all.&nbsp  I should be a complete vegan. I've tried once, unsuccessfully, to refrain from consuming all meat and animal related products. It was a nightmare. I really admire those strict vegetarians who are so disciplined in their quest to abstain from meat and fish. Kudos to them! I find it such a torture when there's so many mouth-watering meat dishes available in Chinkapore. We  are  known to be a major food hub...  When I was a little girl, I was diagnosed with anaemia and one of the best ways for recovery is to eat more red meat. My Ah Ma used to boil those pig liver soups for me every week because she says it is  'good for women'  (yes, we need the iron to replenish the ' xue ' lost every month...) and with all her delicious home-cooked meat dishes, how can I not enjoy such yummers?   However, that didn't stop me from loving and respecting all of God's creatures. I just adore them to smithereens! Cats, dogs, horses, lambs, tigers, bears, even snakes and crocs. A zoo is my funhouse and safaris are a dream! If I could be the next Noah, I would be honored.  Well, I did another unexpected kitty rescue tonight. It got locked in a paint shop by accident, so it was trying to escape through open gaps high above the gates. Obiviously afraid of the height, it kept meowing and peering down as if to consider a huge jump. That seemed like the entire night because while I was having teh, cake and candles with  urlLink Mygisy  at the Spize next door around 9ish before the fan-tabulous  urlLink "Taegukgi"  movie  and  then 12ish again after the movie, it was  still  up there meowing away. The poor sweetie! It probably needed to pee really badly. Hmm...I had to do  something ...  Calling Animal Rescue 101! No lycra tight suit whatsoever to strip into, I grabbed a nearby empty chair and held it up to the kitty. Somehow having lived with the cutest phat cat for the past 4 years, I've must have managed to master some cat lingo, cuz after much coaxing, the kitty finally decided to jump onto the upheld chair and land safely to familiar ground. Hurray! Mission accomplished.  At least this was alot safer than the road rescue one eons ago.  Hehe . All in all, it was a nice night with the 'hubby' adding another wise year to his name.  Mwahaha...  Time to go dream about grenades, mines, flag points, MGs, maggots and bloody soldiers...

       urlLink    NEW! Gross Lip Oil! Sold exclusively at our local friendly 24hr mamak shoppe....Hurry, while stock lasts!&nbsp; urlLink     See...one of the simple reasons why it's so hard to move my cheese. We have everything here. Well,  almost . So how can I ship out, cop out, go totally ballistic and seek greener pastures eh? During this time of the year, I should be displaying a certain red and white cloth outside my window or perhaps don more red and white clothes.  Riiiiggghhhtt . Apologies, but it ain't no fourth of July for me. Not that I don't appreciate being a product of this soil, but I reckon alot of XYZ generations of Chinkaporeans feel this same way.   I guess life is really all about choices. As cliche as it sounds, I'm only beginning to feel some truth in it now. There's a friend who stopped her high-flying modelling career to do a simple freelance stylist job which keeps her grounded and happy. Another has left his high-paying IT career to explore his passions in the arts and be happy. Yet another has turned his love for diving into a  urlLink dive resort  in Manado with full facilities and despite the tough challenge, he is excited and happy. Common word found :  HAPPY . To strive for happiness, prosperity  and progress for our nation ...or for ourselves?  Ok, I'm feeling the seven-year itch. Or rather nine years. Omigosh. I've been in this line for nine phuckin years!!! I'm still  lovin it  though. Just need to cogitate ( ooh, new word I learnt !) and make some new choices. Heh. I know I should just kick back, relax and let it come to my mind...but knowing me, I'm keen to seek whatever my passion leads me to next. Living life on the edge, I'd say. I'm glad that there are still quite a number of us still being driven by our passions and surviving in Chinkapoo Land or we all may as well be ' garment lobots ' leading the saddest structured lives.    Sheet . My mistaken 'hubby' Mygi just sent me a link to some blog site for us Chinkaporeans to express our lubb for our country.  Woah.  Just as I was on the roll about patriotism to our homeland. I'm just NOT feeling it right now really. Maybe I'm just bored with our deemed perfect lives. How we blame others but not ourselves just to make things right.  Ooh , the unbelievable island-wide blackout the other day...people are actually demanding reasons to get over their shock.  Blackout si blackout lor . What more is there to say?   I could go on and gripe about lots of other things I can't quite comprehend about our beloved ' garment ' but I should stop. I may get blacklisted by some spy within the blog system for defamation. Heh. My father is one such soul who has been targeted upon already. He can be too brutally honest. Damn...my life would have been pretty radical if he actually accepted an offer to be part of our ' garment ' system. Hey, we would have had that little cosy police post outside my gate with a tiny blue uniformed man inside. How protected. ;P  Oh well...home is where the heart is eh? Surely. Once my filial piety is done and everyone is happy, I shall finally move my cheese.    P.S. For the record, I'm not wanting to leave this land for good. Just wanting some atmospheric change, a new beginning perhaps...then feel that aching burn in my heart when I crave for 'chwee kuay' or 'bak kut teh'. Perhaps only then will I start hangin my red and white cloth outside my window WAY before August.

       urlLink    I yam what I yam...Meoooooowwwwrrrrr....  I've succumbed to temptation. Nothing serious. Just 3 digestive LIGHT cookies at 2am in the night. Bah. Yes, I have been unsuccessfully trying to  curb my food intake  which is just a phrase better than the word - DIET. Short-term reasoning = important magazine shoot in two days. Long-term reasoning = I just wanna look good can? :P  Before I get anyone riled up about how women love to say that they're fat when in fact they're not, let me just state that I ain't fat. Like what a dear friend would say, I'm just FUZZY around the edges. Hmm. Sounds better than my usual nicked punchline, "I AIN'T FAT, I'M JUST BIG-BONED!" Fine, I'm just a funky chunky munky. Heh.  I've come to realise that being happy with yourself exudes that certain sense of confidence. Not too pompous but just that simple satisfaction about who you really are. In this blood-sucking industry I swim in, it's been a tough battle to keep up that confidence. Especially when majority of the masses can be so utterly judgemental. As one prominent make-up artist would put it, "WAH, it's you ah...I thought who's this  auntie  that just walked in leh...why you so fat now?" Thanks but no thanks.  Sheesh.   I'm phat like dat aight! Even when I was in my illest state on a hospital bed, I was still fairly bulky. So why the hell is everyone giving me pressure to be a skinny ass? It's no wonder I love shopping for clothes in the States. I'm considered a PETITE over there. Woohoo! Feel good time. Moreover, they give allowance to broad shoulders like mine in their tee shirt cuts. Unlike the usual small shoulders and short torso pieces we have here. Get real, priz.   Nonetheless, I have been rather fortunate at this time of my life. I've managed to secure most of my jobs due to my  spunky  personality and  bursting  talent rather than how I look.  So they say lah.  At least there are still those who see through the facade of twiggy glory. Hurrah.   Well, I am now awaiting good news with bated breath for my next job based on that presumption. Non-grago, non-modelle vee jey....Hmm, I might be the first-ever! Ha! Wish me luck! :)  In the meantime, it's back to the gymmy now that my dates are more flexi. Yoga anyone?

      I just had to ride on the topic posted by my dear friend, Miygs. ANGELS ARE EVERYWHERE... yes, indeed. As much as I've read all about the archangels, cherubims and seraphims in the hierachy up there, I still believe EVERYONE is an angel. Perhaps at some point in their lives they made that little difference to make the world a better place. Just like how I reckon that's why things happen for a reason. Being at the right place at the right time.  I know I've had many angels who guarded me through the past years. Most of whom I try not to forget to let them know how much they mean to me. However, there's still that handful who will never know how much they mean to you. Or perhaps you may never want to let them know. Pride, heartbreak, disappointment. The works.  What I do know is that without these special souls, I would not have been where I am today. And with that, I strive to pay it forward. Somehow, someway...it was ALL meant to be.

      Only three hours of slumber the night before and I awake to start the grind for the next 15 hours. Has my brain ceased to function or am I just being plain ignorant to the cries of fatigue from my living system?  Bah.  Gone are the  'party-till-dawn-and-still-can-work-the-following-morning'  days of my life. I have resigned to the fact that I am no longer the Hardcore Party Chick I thought I was, and that I now live vicariously through others who are still able to rawk till dawn. However, the Alchy Threshold Numba Two crown amongst the girls, I still get to keep. Anyone up for a Hoe? Heh.  The last minute Monday night drinkies was for a friend's birthday celebration. Or rather sob-eration. Yes, no tears of joy...just pure heartwrenching agonised weeping. And lo behold, it's the S.N.A.G. I have come to a conclusion that I cannot stomach non-queer testosteronies crying their hearts out for a forsaken love. And to have that past affection stand right there and look helpless at the broken man. Wtf?!   Is it some sort of conspiracy now that the tables have turned on the genders in relationships? Or do I have too many macho mates finally relenting to the powers of the new WOMAN? Perhaps all men are really not bastards. Just misunderstood sons. Sons of bitches. No wait. Bitches  are  daughters of bastards. So I guess it all boils down to warped DNA composition from our forefathers.  Wateva.   To all the lovely people out there, perhaps it's a good habit to start cultivating better communication skills into our interpersonal relationships, so that we can at least continue to say  "Let's drink and be MERRY!"  No more parting words, no more accusations, no more childish tantrums, no more drunk calls to exes, no more  "I-love-you-but-I-can't-be-with-you" , no more  "You've-always-been-the-one" ....Zip it. Thank you.     P.S.  Pardon my gibberish...I just hate to see a friend in such a state of depression on his happiest day. Then again, I can TOTALLY understand where he's coming from and I've also been on the other side of the coin to cause such pain. Gulp. What comes around goes around eh? It's all too familiar. :P

      Mr. Miyagi has finally succeeded in getting me to surrender the colors of my grey matter to the clogspot. Sheet. I need a Blogger for Dumbass handbook...oh well. Greetings, one and all. Who is gonna be reading this? Own up or face my wrath. Heh. Yes, it must be the grapeseed oil. Does OOOOOOOLLLLLLIIIIVVVVVEEEEE sound like GGGGGGRRRRRRAAAAAPPPPEEEEEESSSSEEEEEDD to you? I know it's an excellent ingredient to hydrate my face but sorry waitress, it smells like teen spirit. Baby oil perhaps...ain't too good on my carbo loaf. Thanks but NO thanks. Hmph. But all's good la...nothin more to rant about it since I had excellent company, matching portafonies, super rare meat and last but not least, a good NUMBER TWO in the toilet. :)  Don't stray those thoughts now, this IS a clogspot isn't it? So one's movement of bowels is VERY important. WHen you gotta go, ya gotta go. DO IT! Just DO IT!

      And so I'm back. Did anyone miss me? I didn't. The boring ole' me back in the heartlands, waking up to the drilling of renovation works from a new neighbour, the hustle and bustle of post-national day hip-hop-hurray life with a new PM in duty. How wonderful. Will these things  ever  change? Someone once told me that Chinkapoor is right smack at a pressure point of the Earth's fengshui.  Hmm.  That explains the sense of peace whenever I'm leaving on the jetplane or coach to anywhere but here. Heh.  Fine. I'm not complaining. I just need to miss this country. A mere week out of it is NOT enough. Where can I go? When should I go? Sigh. Well, at least I've finally got the parents to agree on retiring to a lovely shophouse home in Chiangmai sometime in the near future, so only then will I be able to be on my own in any part of the world to live life. So I hope. They will be happy and so will I. Positive thinking. Fingers crossed.   Anyway , thank God I didn't have to check in at Chulalongkorn Hospital on this trip. I stayed clear of all the road-side stalls even thought the array of goodies were calling out to me as I walked by. It was a struggle I tell you. All my favourites. The nicest thing this time round being in my motherland was actually having a chance to get out of the touristy area and live in a lovely small apartment at Sukhumvit. A little uptown and posh area according to Thai standards but it was still simple living. I loved it. Everything was just so cheap, I felt rich. Heh. A bowl of " kway tew neua " at a food court costs S$0.80 and an upmarket fusion restaurant's  fungi linguine  costs about S$8?   Met up with friends and family, shopped at the markets for decor things like drums and lamps, stocked up on cheap underwear and eucalyptus tissues, partied till dawn at their funkiest clubs. It was nice. I brushed up on my mother tongue as well, so they said. Hee. I think one should stay in the country of chosen language at least a month to actually learn how they speak. I reckon it's the best tried and tested way. Fast and effective. Especially when you're in the line of fire and everyone around you is blabbering so fast in alien speak. May as well be deaf if you don't try your darnest to tune in your own antenna.  So after a fancy upgraded CX flight back on business class (Ooh..with so much space, chunky me felt so small!)  and hungovered from a wild party the night before, I've returned to wash my dirty laundry and clean the house. And as I'm typing this I'm SO looking out for my next chance to hop on that plane again...   urlLink    Bright and colourful plastic twirlies at the market. Wanted so much to get them but I really don't have anywhere to hang them...   urlLink    I WANT THIS LAMP! Just need a nice new studio pad...

       urlLink    Things to do, places to see, faces to meet, water to drink...   "Gullible's Travels"  strikes again. Apologies to our fellow countrymen, but I won't be settling my ass anywhere near the stadium to plug my ears during the flypast and usual singsong, nor will I be settling it anywhere near the esplanade for a full free view of exploding fireworks. Such a  wonderful  celebration to welcome in a new PM.   Nevertheless, I am returning to the mothership and reporting for holiday duty. I dare say I'm excited even though it's not the best time I should leave. Leaving the hubz, homies, girlies, all behind.  Not good . I'm sure the true ones will understand eh? Hee. They know me. I have to get away from all this...  Would have loved to go visit a dear galpal (whom I miss talking to very much) or jet on a longer flight to elsewhere, but alas I have to stick with BUDGET 2004 if I want to make it for another friend's wedding in Melb. Ahh...  In the meantime, there's just SO much to do before I make like a baby and head out.  Stress.   Over and out.

       urlLink    Lazy days ahead...  I'm having a severe lack of sleep and STILL in the midst of excavation work at Ground Zero. Things are more or less in their proper places and unnecessary items have finally been discarded for good. Yay. I'm on the road to recovery from ' collectivitis '! Mr. Junkman will not be very pleased when he approaches my trash area later in the morning. Bags and boxes galore...  I'm not exactly a clean freak but I just don't wanna put up in a rat's nest. Home is a place of solace and if I have too much shit in it, I may as well rent a toilet. You might think I'm anal but I'd like to call it meticulous maintainenance of my surroundings. My momma used to tell me that how you keep your home reflects on the person that you are. So I guess now that my habitat resembles a war zone, I must be one confused general. I need to find my peace.   Indulging myself in a nice relaxing beach holiday would be ace right now. Spa would be a bonus. But alas, money and time is a huge considerable factor. Dammit. So should I stay or should I go?  Hmm.
