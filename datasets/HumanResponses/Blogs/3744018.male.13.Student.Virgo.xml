      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "Hagrid! Hagrid!" yells Ron pounding at the door of Hagrid's hut.  The noise of Fang barking and heavy footsteps makes Ron stop pounding on the door.  "Fang move aside. It's bloody three in da morning, this better be good." Hagrid bellows, as he opens the door and swings it wide to see a smiling Ron looking at him.  "Ron what's wrong? Harry in trouble? He's not in the forest is he?"  "No Hagrid, none of that. I'm sorry I had to wake you but I need a huge favor," begs Ron in an almost pleading voice.  "What favor? At three in da morning, come in here and tell me what's going on." Hagrid said, ordering Ron to come in and pointing at the table and chair for Ron to sit in.    Ron explains the whole conversation he had with Professor Dumbledore, minus the Hermione part, to Hagrid over tea and his rock cakes. Oddly enough, Ron ate the rock cakes as he figured it would be the only thing he could keep down in his stomach. They were just too heavy to throw up.  "I still don't see why this couldn't wait for da morning Ron. Are you telling me everything?" asks Hagrid suspecting Ron's strange behavior.  "Hermione is seeing...Malfoy, and I want to leave before I see her in the morning."  "Hermione seeing Draco, - CODSWALLOP! Where you hear such a lie?"  "Listen Hagrid, I really don't want to re-live it. You can ask her yourself. So can I have the recommendation, please Hagrid?"  "Sure Ron, but you are making a mistake about Hermione."   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ron raced back to the Gryffindor tower to pack. After an hour and a half of silently packing in the dark, Ron had everything he needed and everyone was still asleep, even Harry.  Ron set down at his study desk; he figured he owned Ginny an explanation.  Dear Ginny,    I don't have much time so I will be brief. At times like this, you find out who your real friends are and just how important family is. Unfortunately, yesterday I learned the hard way.    I am leaving Hogwarts for the next 3 months to take a Co-op job with Charlie in Romania. I am not sure if I will be any good handling dragons, but I definitely will be glad to be away from this place. Please keep Pig for me while I'm gone, because I seriously doubt if he can fly and deliver on such a long international route. Better to use International Postal Owls instead. I promise while I am gone to write once a week to you.    I love you Ginny and I am sorry I will not be around during Christmas; it just really hurts and I need some time and space.  -Ron  PS. Keep this info to yourself, I do not want anyone else knowing where I am. That especially means a certain Head Girl.  PSS. Don't tell Harry, the back stabbing git, either!  PSSS. Keep an eye on Harry for me.      Ron attaches the letter to Pig's leg for him to deliver it to Ginny during breakfast. He performs the Feather Weight Charm to his old locker and attaches it to the back of his CleanSweep broomstick. Then he climbs down the spiral staircase for the Gryffindor common room.    However, In the common room on top of a chair near the portrait entrance, set Crookshanks watching Ron come down the stairs.    Ron at first used to hate Crookshanks but after several years, they both began to tolerate one another. As if only for the sake of Hermione, both of them learned to be friendly.  "Meow!"  "Crookshanks?" asks Ron in disbelief that anyone would be up much less an always-sleeping cat.  "Purr!"  Ron pets Crookshanks and says, "Crookshanks...I cannot believe I'm talking to a cat. I am losing it."  Ron exhales as he finishes shaking his head before adding, "Crookshanks keep an eye out for Hermione for me. I am going to be gone for a while, so it is your job to protect her. Oh, and do me a favor if you see Malfoy, claw his balls off for me."  "Meow!"   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "Five fifteen - just need to drop this recommendation off in McGonagall's office then I'm out of here." Ron said to himself leaving his broom and trunk hovering near the front entrance next to the Great Hall.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Hermione rose up early than usual after having another romantic dream of Draco and her by the lake. She could almost feel his kisses on her lips. The sensation brings a small smile to her face as she takes a shower and dresses in her school uniform. She decides to go to breakfast a little bit early today, as she has to post the new Prefect Patrol schedule along with the new dress code requirements for Prefects. Lately the school dress code had not been strict as it once was. Allowing students to wear individual apparel and personal clothing items. Not to mention how a few of the boys are looking and dressing like slobs, one Redhead Prefect in particular came into mind when Draco and Hermione agreed to re-enforce the dress code rules. She knew she had to speak with Ron about that and about skipping out of Potions from yesterday. Of course, she would have to wait until eight o-clocks before he usually get up. As for enforcing the dress code throughout Hogwarts, Draco and she would need the staffs' approval for the general student population and the next staff meeting is a week away.    Hermione strolls to the Great Hall to find a broomstick and a locker near the entrance.  "I can not believe someone, some lazy oaf, left this in the hallway," cries Hermione in the hopes that the someone hears her.  "Fine. Then I'll have to confiscate it until someone is willing to take detention for it," announces Hermione to the hallway as she pulls out her wand and stands beside the broomstick.    The old and used locker had a Gryffindor seal on it, and looks vaguely familiar to her. Then she notices the initials RBW on the side of the locker.  "Expelliarmus!"    Hermione wand immediately flies out of her hand and lands banging and rolling down the hallway 20 feet away. Now she is really mad, as magic is not allowed in the hallways after classes. She angrily spins around to see a tired and sick Ron pointing his wand at her.  "Ron, what are you doing?! You are-a-Prefect! You are not supposed to be doing magic in the hallways," screams Hermione not believing how stupid her best friend can be. "Are you even listening to me?!"  Ron ignores her row as he walks past her and jumps on his broomstick. He kicks off hovering eight feet off the ground as if to avoid her reach.  "Ron you can not fly in the hallways! Get down here this instant!"  Ron took one deep look at Hermione before saying, "I'm leaving. Good bye – Hermione Granger."  Ron turns his head toward the front entrance and slowly flies his way to it as Hermione is screaming and jumping at him from below.  "Ronald Weasley, you get down here this instant! What do you mean leaving?! I have a good mind to write your mother!"  Ron clears the giant front wooden doors and without looking back, he takes off into the sunrise.  "Ron! RON!" screams Hermione feeling remorse and pain at watching Ron fly away.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  As Harry and Ginny are eating breakfast, Harry looks up and around the Great Hall before asking, "Have you seen Ron? His locker and his clothes are missing as well."  Just then, Pig flies in a circle pattern over to Ginny and delivers a letter to her, hooting in celebration. The letter brought a worry face to Ginny as she unties the letter from Pig's leg.  "What is it Gin? Is it Ron?" asks Harry really worry about his best mate, as he watches Ginny read the letter in Ron's handwriting.  Ginny's facial complexion turns to a deep red as she finishes the letter.  "He left!"

      “The whole school will know and I’ll be the laughing stock sidekick once again,” thought Ron sitting beneath his favorite tree by the lake underneath the stars and half moon.  “I have every class with her and not to mention a bunch with Draco in them too. I can’t sit in another class with them two looking at one another,” thought Ron grabbing his rolling stomach. “And you know that ferret is just going to rub it in, when Hermione’s back is turn. I’ll pound him into lunchmeat and they will expel me because he’s the Head Boy. Dirty rotten lying ferret. He want that, probably been planning all of this just to see me get expelled. I’ll quit first.”  Ron minds think back to when Fred and George quit and left school.  “They quit and even got to join the order. Of course, if I quit I can kiss being in Auror goodbye. Well not like, I had a chance anyway. I am barely passing my classes now and no way can I get all them NEWTs’ to be an Auror. They do not want me anyway, they just want Harry. They want the Boy-who- lived, not sidekick stupid Weasley. So stupid he didn’t know his girl was cheating on him.” Ron thought looking up at the half moon.  “Feels like my heart – ripped down the middle.”  Ron hits his head on the tree while he continues to think, “Stupid”...bang...”stupid”...bang...”stupid”...bang. “Draco has probably dated 20 girls including Hermione and I haven’t even really dated one. I mean I could be the world’s worst kisser and I wouldn’t know it, and he can kiss the knickers off any of them. The Anti-Christ has my girl and I can’t do a bloody thing about it.”  “Stupid”...bang...”stupid”...bang.  “Get a grip now; plan your next move - just like wizard’s chess. I cannot stay and I don’t want to stay. Quit then. Maybe, I could get Fred and George to let me stay at their place and I can work in their shop in return. I might even try to go to a few Quidditch team tryouts for Keeper. Then who knows if I practice really hard maybe I can be on Chudley Cannons.” Ron dreams of a better future for himself.  “It won’t be easy. Of course, I’m not a Malfoy where every thing is handed to me on a silver platter. No, I’m a Weasley and I’ll just have to work hard to earn it.” Ron thought, and making his mind up as he stands and walks back toward the castle.  Ron makes his way in through the front entrance and slowly walks back to the Gryffindor tower to get his stuff to leave.  “Mr. Weasley it’s past midnight, where have you been?” demands Professor McGonagall gliding over to him with a stern look on her face.  “Oh...hi professor I was at the lake,” replies Ron not even stopping as he walks past Professor McGonagall.  “Mr. Weasley...Mr. Wealsey stop this instant. No student, even a prefect is allowed to walk on the grounds after curfew.” McGonagall angrily shouts, as she is a little bit flustered at Ron’s reaction. “I’m afraid you will have to serve a week’s detention with Mr. Filch.”  Ron wheels around and unbuttons his prefect badge before saying, “It doesn’t matter Professor, I decided to quit.”  “It certainly does matter...what do you mean quit?” asks McGonagall changing her tone from anger to confusion.  “I quit Hogwarts. I’m sorry. Here’s the prefect badge and I’m going to miss you,” replies Ron handing her the badge and then briefly hugging a confused Professor McGonagall.  “Mr....Mr. Weasley you can’t be serious.”  “Yes ma’am. I can’t stay any longer, personal reasons. So I’m going upstairs to pack and I’ll be gone in an hour or two.” Ron said, turning around and walking to the staircase with a shock Professor McGonagall following.  “Your mother, Molly, will not approve of this Mr. Weasley,” retorts McGonagall trying to keep up with Ron.  “Yeah well, it won’t be the first bloody time she yells at me. But don’t worry I’ll join the Order straight away. I ought to at least be useful for something.”  “Mr. Weasley, watch your language and stop right now,” snaps Professor McGonagall, a little bit winded as she tries to keep up with Ron.  “Sorry Professor, Hey can I call you Minerva now?” asks Ron stopping at the foot of the staircase and waiting on Professor McGonagall to catch up.  “No you may not,” snaps Professor McGonagall resizing up Ron and the situation. “Mr. Weasley perhaps it is better if we have this discussion in Professor Dumbledore’s office.”  Ron gulped for air at the mention of Dumbledore and thought it better to leave him out of it.  “If it’s all the same to you. I rather just get my stuff and quietly leave.”  “In the dead of night as it were,” said Professor McGonagall finishing Ron’s thought.  “Exactly ma’am, it just takes me an hour to pack,” said Ron smiling back at Professor McGonagall, as she understands on how he wants to leave.  “No Mr. Weasley, but I promise after you talk with Professor Dumbledore you can leave as quickly and quietly as you want.” Professor McGonagall smugly replies as she pulls out her wand and starts tapping it against her other hand.  Ron gulps more air and nods his head in defeat, as Professor McGonagall leads him to Professor Dumbledore’s office with her wand out.  “Canary Creams!”  The Phoenix statue staircase moves as Ron and Professor McGonagall ride it to Dumbledore’s office.  “Mr. Weasley, stay right here until we call for you. And I do mean right here,” firmly orders Professor McGonagall.  “Yes ma’am.”  After twenty minutes outside of Professor Dumbledore’s office, “Mr. Weasley you can come joins us.” Professor Dumbledore said, with a calm voice.  Ron slowly enters the tower office of the Headmaster. The Headmaster’s portraits are all feigning sleep, the books and shiny objects are a little bit dustier since the last time he has been in the office. He looks around the corner to see an adult red Phoenix on his perch. Behind the Phoenix is Professor McGonagall standing to the right of Professor Dumbledore, who is sitting behind his cherry oak desk.  “Hello Fawkes,” said Ron walking over to the Phoenix and petting his beak.  Over the years since being rescued and carried out of the Secret Chamber, Ron has grown to admire and befriend the resilient Phoenix. Harry is still Fawkes favorite student, but Ron is a close second.  “Please be seated Mr. Weasley,” interrupts Professor McGonagall pointing to an empty chair in front of Professor Dumbledore‘s desk.  “Yes ma’am,” replies Ron leaving a singing Fawkes and falling into the chair a little bit tired and impatient at wanting this to be over.  “I understand you wish to leave us Mr. Weasley,” replies Professor Dumbledore with a sad look in his eyes.  Ron had never got the sense that Professor Dumbledore viewed him as a favorite student of his, as he did with the twins, Fred and George, Harry, or even Hermione for that matter. Not that he did not help or show any displeasure toward him. He just never had a personal connection with the Headmaster. Ron always felt that Dumbledore viewed him as Harry’s trusted sidekick and nothing more. So lacking a personal connection, he decided it best to be formal and quick with the answers.  “Yes sir for personal reasons.”  “Would those personal reasons be because of a certain Head Girl?” asks Professor Dumbledore with a touch of sadness in his voice and coming straight to the point.  The abruptness of the question, manage to catch his funny bone. Ron had been throwing up all day and for all practical purpose was thinking and running with a tank on empty. His wit and humor seem to be the only thing working within him after that last question.  “Ha-ha...hahaha...Am I the last person to know? Ha-ha!” madly cracks Ron standing up and walking to the door as he is laughing with tears running down his cheeks. “Hahaha...cheers!”  Ron reaches for the doorknob only to have it snap back shut.  “Mr. Weasley...Ronald, my boy would you like some tea and cake,” pleads Professor Dumbledore waving his wand and creating a platter of slice cake and a pitcher of hot tea.  “Ha-ha...to be honest with you Professor I’ve been throwing up all day it seems like, so I doubt if I could hold it down.” Ron said, twisting the doorknob again to get out and wondering why he managed to start crying now of all times. “I appreciate what you are doing, but I can’t stay and I won’t. I’m of age, so if you just let me out; I’ll pack, leave, then go someplace and quietly die.”  “Before you die, how about a little Earl Grey,” replies Professor Dumbledore moving around his desk and pouring the tea into a small teacup. “It always soothes my stomach. Come on over and lets talk about it.”  Ron twists the doorknob again, and gives up as he lays his forehead against the door.  “Mr. Weasley...Ron, you are not the first person to have a broken heart. I can assure you,” calmly adds Professor McGonagall whipping up another chair for herself with her wand.  “She was different, she was special...and now she is in love with an evil ferret. Now the slightest touch or thought of her makes me vomit,” remarks Ron but as he is talking about her he remembers Hermione passionately kissing Draco again in his memory. Causing him to make a quick lunge at a small wastebasket in Dumbledore’s office.  After a few painful seconds, Ron pleads one more time with his head in the wastebasket.  “The deal...Blagh!...the deal was if I come to the office and talk then you would let me go quietly. I came, I added something to the trash, and now I’m going.” Ron remarks, standing up, wipes his face, and tries to maintain his balance. “I will still join the Order and be useful – guard duty, messenger, sacrificed pawn, or paperweight. I’ll be good for something.”  Ron walks over to the door and retries the doorknob; it will not budge. Now Ron’s anger kicks in as he remembers he is a wizard. He pulls out his wand and points it at the door.  “Alohamo...”  Professor Dumbledore is quietly sitting down, sipping his tea, and watching and listening at Ron. Just before Ron can finish his spell, Dumbledore waves his wand and retrieves Ron’s wand from across the room.  “What the...bugger!” snaps Ron looking at Professor Dumbledore put Ron’s wand next to a full teacup for Ron.  “Earl Grey really does help soothe the stomach,” replies Professor McGonagall in the most British of voices as she is sitting down beside Professor Dumbledore and sipping her tea.  Ron tries the doorknob one more time, and then acknowledges his defeat by sitting back down beside a smiling Professor Dumbledore and McGonagall.  “So tell me Ronald what are your plans after leaving us?” asks Professor Dumbledore finishing his tea and looking directly at Ron.  “I thought I stay with Fred and George, practice during my off hours and go tryout for a Keeper on a Quidditch team.”  “And what about your plans for Miss Granger?” asks Professor Dumbledore still looking directly at Ron’s eyes.  “Professor I know you are a master at Legimency, but do you mind. It’s freaking me out with you in my head. Bad enough, I’m barely in there myself.” Ron snaps, and breaking his eye contact with Professor Dumbledore.  “Ha-ha ok Mr. Weasley, but your wide arrange of emotions and feelings right now are making it difficult for me to see the truth.” Professor Dumbledore said, sliding the teacup into Ron’s hand. “Not that it matters you have always been truthful to me. So would you be willing to take a few days off from classes, instead of leaving us.”  “No Professor...I really would just like to leave Hogwarts and borrowing some emergency home study program, I rather just leave.”  “For your brothers in London,” finishes Professor McGonagall.  “Yes ma’am,” replies Ron putting the teacup down beside him.  “Actually we were thinking of letting you leave for your other brother,” replies Professor Dumbledore with a small smile and twinkle in his eyes.  “Bill?!”  “No Mr. Weasley.”  “Charlie, but he’s in Romania at the Preserve.” Ron said, waiting for the explanation from Professor Dumbledore and McGonagall.  “We have setup a 2-3 month Co-op position with the Dragon Preserve. Where Charlie Weasley your brother works at. The Co-op is a working position where you will be working at handling and taking care of dragons. I envy how much fun you will have. Now you will get a small salary each week, but you also have to work on a 20-foot scroll for us on what you have learned before coming back. Now this will be a long 3 month Co-op as you will be working there over the Christmas break.” Professor Dumbledore said, with a small smile and distant look on his face as he mentions dragons.  “Excuse me sir. Is it just me or is it Harry and me,” interrupts Ron wanting to know if he had to go beg Harry to join him in order to go.  “No Mr. Weasley, just you. Providing that you can get the Professor of Magical Creatures recommendation for this Co-op.”  “Just me?! You are not going to send Ginny and a bunch of Slytherin there a week after me, are you?” asks Ron not believing what he is hearing.  “No, Mr. Weasley for the entire 3 months it will just be you,” finishes Professor Dumbledore.  “Now you will be behind in you NEWT studies when you get back, but you will have at least 5 months before you actually take the tests, to catch up on the 2 months of school that you will miss.” Professor McGonagall adds, finishing her cup of tea and smiling at the excitement of Ron’s face.  “Really? This is real...I can leave right now?” asks Ron almost giddy at not having to drop out of school but still able to leave Hogwarts.  “After you get the recommendation from Hagrid, then you can catch the 8:00 o-clock train at Hogsmeade station to London, correction – I forgot you can Apparate and you have your license from the Ministry.”  “Yes sir, I got it after my birthday.”  “Then you can Apparate directly to the Ministry of Magic International Portkey office and they will send you directly to the preserve.” Professor Dumbledore said, tapping his finger on his cheek and stroking his long white beard. “First you have to finish your tea, mind you.”  “Yes sir,” replies Ron gulping the tea in one fell swoop then jumping up and racing toward the door to go see Hagrid.  “Mr. Weasley, you might need this,” reminds Professor McGonagall holding up Ron’s wand.  “Professors, thank you, both of you.” Ron said, racing back to the chair to get his wand and then finally leaving Dumbledore’s office.  “Whew – for a second there Albus, I almost thought he wouldn’t take the deal.” Professor McGonagall adds, exhaling in relief.  “I wonder if we shouldn’t ask again for him to stay. You do not know how important someone is to you until they leave you. I have a very bad feeling we are going to find out just how important young Mr. Weasley is to us.” Professor Dumbledore said, in a very tired voice.  “The poor boy is embarrassed and heartbroken. I do not think anything would have kept him here. If you offered him all the Galleons in Gringotts to stay, he still would’ve refused.”  Professor Dumbledore says nothing as he stands up and moves to his telescope to see Ron running out on the grounds toward Hagrid’s hut.

      Dragon Heart   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Chapter 1 – Love is Blind  (Beta Version)   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   To Ron the image that burned in his mind, didn't match what he believed to be true. In spite of all the evidence that led him to be standing outside of an empty Charms classroom and watching two people passionately kissing one another. There simply had to be another reason: Polyjuice potion, mistaken identity, love potion or something, anything other than his Hermione kissing Draco Malfoy.    The smirk of Draco as he drew back for air and the small smile of Hermione that he had seen thousands of times, quickly extinguished his last remaining hopes and started a tidal wave of heartache and pain. Clearly, he could recognize evil and arrogant Head Boy Draco Malfoy, his arch-nemesis since the first day of attending Hogwarts, wrapping his arms around her and squeezing tightly for another embrace. What was not so clear to Ron was Head Girl; Hermione Granger, the secret love of his life, passionately returning the kiss. Why would Hermione, the brightest, bravest, and most beautiful witch in Hogwarts be kissing a boy who for the last six years has done everything in his power and family money to make life miserable for Hermione, Harry, and himself.  "Can't she see through the lies of this arrogant and evil ferret?" Ron thought to himself.    The giggling of Hermione as Draco reached into her robes immediately broke Ron's thoughts. Hermione quickly re-consummates the kiss with a sexual passion that Ron had never seen before. The realization of this moment had finally arrived. Hermione is in love with Draco. No longer was she the one that Ron had hoped to spend his life with. She chose another, in spite of his undying love, the life-saving trust between them, and the six and a half years of friendship. In the end, extreme confidence, power, money, & looks won.    Which Ron could never offer her, he nor Harry was chosen for Head Boy. A position, that offered its own private and shared common room with the Head Girl. Ron was merely a seventh year prefect delegated to do nightly patrols with Mr. Filch and Mrs. Norris, while Harry had the honor of being the Quidditch Captain, not that he minded.    As for money, his family barely made enough to keep him in school. Even his older brothers: Bill, Charlie, Fred & George had to contribute to the family so that Ginny and he could get much needed new school robes. Malfoy had more Galleons stacked at Gringotts vault than most wizards and witches in England combined.    As for looks, Malfoy manage to generate the biggest of smiles from the girls in Hogwarts. His straight blond hair, to his blue eyes, combined with his Quidditch physique made him a heartthrob among the girls. Ron's lanky body of 6 ft 2, thick messy red hair and second hand clothes had none of the girls turning their heads at him.    Lastly, extreme confidence or in Ron's view of Malfoy—arrogance is whole heartily in Malfoy's corner. Ron couldn't dare tell his feelings about Hermione to even his closest friend, Harry Potter. The fear of rejection and ultimately losing her friendship kept him silent for years. He had always known that Hermione could have any guy in Hogwarts or out, and it scared him more than anything that if he came out with his feelings, she would run to another.    Hermione was lifting Draco's robes off and sliding her hand into his shirt. This sight was the last thing that Ron could bear as he felt the need to find the Men's loo. He held his mouth shut as he dashed through a crowd of 3rd years, past Peeves throwing ink pellets at him and down the staircase to the 2nd floor Boy's bathroom, just in the nick of time. His stomach as if taking marching orders from his heart violently heaved his breakfast and lunch. After fifteen minutes of trying to recover himself; he realized that he was late for his NEWT Potions with Professor Snape and sprints to the dungeons.    Ron opened the Potions' classroom door quietly and seeing Professor Snape lecture while facing the chalkboard, he quickly made his way to Harry and Hermione's station that has an empty seat beside Hermione. Ron seated himself, while Professor Snape was still lecturing on the uses and benefits of Dragon's blood.  "Now that I've explain everything to you all, except for Mr. Wealsey who thinks he can sneak into my class whenever he likes," Snape snarled, turning around from the chalkboard and looking directly at Ron. Ron after being used to six years of taunts from Snape merely raise his head and looks at his scowling face.  "You shouldn't have been late," Hermione whispered to Ron.  "Well Mr. Weasley, are you going to offer a feeble excuse?" asked Snape, moving closer to Ron and looking at him directly in the eyes.  "I was feeling sick and had to throw up in the loo," answered Ron, almost willing Snape to use Legimency to see the disgusting image of him, throwing up in the bathroom.  Professor Snape broke the stare, looking disgusted at Ron's answer. "Yes be that as it may, 10 points from Gryffindor."  After returning to his desk, Snape tapped a sand time-turner with his wand, causing the sand to move up from the bottom against the gravity to collect upside down on the top.  "You have an hour to complete your Potions." he finished, folding his arms and starting his parade around the room.    Ron just wanted to complete the potion and get out of there. The mere presence of Hermione being so close to him made his heart and stomach ache even more. To make matters worse, Ron caught glances of Hermione smiling at Draco across the room. It was the same glances and smiles that he had been noticing Hermione giving in the Great Hall toward the Slytherin table, for the last few weeks. Moreover, He noticed the secret note that he saw her reading in NEWT Herbology, which made him follow her after class to the empty Charms classroom.    Draco lifted his head from over his boiling cauldron and returned another smile back to Hermione. Hermione responded by biting her lower lip before she looked down and across at Ron. Ron could really feel his heart and stomach rolling all over again.  "Ron, you haven't put anything in your Potion. Honestly, do I have to do everything for you?" said Hermione exasperatedly, while reaching her hand over to Ron's arm to get his attention.    Ron couldn't even hear what she was saying but could instantly feel the cold touch of her hand as she touched his arm. The image of her reaching under Draco's shirt with the same hand less than an hour ago came flooding back to him. He instinctively, jerked his arm away from her, but the damage had already been done, as he raced out of the Dungeon classroom for the Men's loo once again.    After spending some more time in the bathroom, he decided not to risk another encounter and skipped all the rest of the classes. He went to the sanctuary of his four post bed in the Gryffindor's seventh year boys' room.  "Ron – Ron, are you okay?" asked Harry, climbing the stairs with a worried look on his face.  "No Harry, I'm far from ok," Ron whined, looking up at the top of his four post bed, trying to make sense of it all.  "What's wrong with you," asked Harry, jumping into his own bed at the right of Ron's.  "I... I saw Hermione...," replied Ron, not able to put the scenes he witnessed into words.  "You see Hermione everyday...Hello!?" cracked Harry, lying on his side and looking strangely at Ron.  "No, not like that... with another guy," Ron finished, trying to hold his voice on an even tone.  "Are you sure?" asked Harry, with a 'not-too-surprised' look on his face.  "Yeah, Malfoy," replied Ron.  "Maybe you thought you saw something else...," remarked Harry, rolling over and away from Ron.  Ron twisted around his bed to a sitting position, to look at the back of Harry lying on his bed.  "I just said I saw Hermione with Malfoy, and all you can say is maybe I thought I saw something else?" said Ron, in total disbelief at Harry's reaction. "Malfoy, the Death Eater wanna-be, who has tried to make our lives miserable since we got here. That git-faced Malfoy, ring a bell?"  "I know who the ferret is, Ron. I'm just saying are you sure you really saw it?" replied Harry, still not looking up in Ron's direction.  "Yeah Harry, I saw Hermione and Draco in an empty Charms classroom going at it like it was their honeymoon!" snapped Ron, wanting Harry to believe him and trying to hold back the rumbling in his stomach.  An awkward silence settled in between them as Harry exhaled and rolled back over to look at Ron.  Ron immediately noticed the sympathy in Harry's eyes versus the anger he expected to see.  "Ron, she's old enough to make her own decisions."  "You knew – YOU KNEW!" Ron screamed at his best friend.  Harry groaned in pain and spun around on the bed to look directly at Ron, "she swore me to secrecy, when I found out."  "You're my best mate and you knew how I felt about her. How could YOU BLOODY NOT TELL!" Ron said lividly.  "Ron listen, I don't like it anymore than you do, but I've always stayed away from getting involved between you two." Harry pleaded compassionately, guilt written all over his face.  "Well, thank you Harry, and just how long have you been keeping this to yourself?" Ron asked angrily, looking straight at Harry to hear and see his answer.  "Er... about... about a month."  Ron couldn't reply as he had to race to the seventh year boy's bathroom to throw up again.  "Ron...I'm sorry," said Harry apologetically, after Ron finished heaving up everything in his stomach.  "You can keep your apology –Blaugh!- and you can take your knife out of my back. -Blaugh!- Mates don't do this to one another. -Blagh!-  So you can find a new one!" yelled Ron, with his head in the toilet.  "Ron you don't mean it. She said you wouldn't be emotionally mature enough to handle it," Harry explained logically, trying to calm Ron down from breaking their trusted friendship.  "Mature?!... Emotionally mature to handle my best mate lying to me and my love... Hermione... Her betrayal to me for Malfoy?!" Ron bellowed, while sticking his red and green face out of the toilet. "She's right again, because I can't handle it. Because, I don't want to handle it!"  Ron stood up and stuck his head under the shower to wash his face and hair.  "Ron, why don't you just tell her how you feel and I'm sure she will dump the ferret," Harry pleaded with Ron, along the running shower.  "Little late for that, wouldn't you say Harry? I mean I don't have the emotional maturity like Hermione and you have, but it seems to me that after witnessing them this afternoon, I'll say, SHE ALREADY LOVES THE FERRET!" Ron screamed, walking out of the shower, soaking wet in his school robes. In the same state he started climbing down the spiral staircase to the Common Room, with Harry following suit.  "You know you're right. This is my fault. I mean, I cared and loved her for over six years, when I really should have been calling her Mudblood and hoping that a Basilisk would kill her, or Sirius Black do her in or even try to hex her outside the Potions' classroom. Heck, I forgot about the time he tried to get her expelled when they raided the DA meeting and then last year when he told his old dad on us and watched as we almost got killed. Yeah, that's what I should've done instead. All that evil crap, so I could win her heart. I mean Hermione can't help it; chicks dig evil, twisted monsters." Ron said bitterly.  "Ron will you slow down," Harry yelled, reaching the bottom of the Boys' dormitory spiral staircase, as Ron briskly made for the Portrait hole.  "I should've been a Slytherin bad-boy and then I could have dated whoever I wanted." Ron cracked madly, while slamming the portrait on Harry's face.  Harry said nothing as he came to a complete stop and simply looked at the back of the Portrait entrance.  "What's wrong with him," asked Ginny, coming up behind Harry.  "He knows."  "Oh...I better go talk to him before he does something rash," said Ginny, brushing up against Harry to get out.  "No Ginny, He just needs some time on his own. He's in a lot of pain," said Harry, grabbing Ginny by the arm to stop her.
