      this is how it happened  Thursday... F invites me to the movies, and asks L if she wants to come with us (Tuesday's lunch "date" went surprisingly well), but L's says she needs to hit the gym... F and i end up not going to the movies but rather we rent some movies... L shows up around 10:30 and F decides to go to sleep, so i stay up with L drinking some wine and having lots of fun, next thing you know it's 3am and it's raining outside so L tells me i can spend the night... Friday morning... F comes into work and i tell her what happened, and she didnt i'd spent the night, she's a little upset L didn't tell her but they work it out during the day... meantime, L and i are im'ing the whole day.. good thing good thing... Friday night... ok, the drug part.. while watching Casino on thursday, F and i decide to get some blow for friday night and L wanted to also, so friday i met up with my hook up and got 2grams, we were supposed to go somewhere in Central Square in Cambridge to see some band play, but you know hot it is, when that shit is in your hands it's calling out, and call out it did, so we opened one baggie and started... i really thought i was gonna have a bad time but quite on the other hand, we all had a really mellow time talking and snorting and drinking, we all knocked out early like at 1am (relatively early, i suppose) and woke up the next day feeling great,  Saturday morning, L and i are making out and i ask her if she has a condom, and she does so i put it on and i'll skip the details.. but once i'm done, i go to take the condom off and it's not there, so she starts freaking out about it, and we rush to Planned Parenthood, yeah, great way to wake the fuck up (quite literally) we've both been checked and we both are clean, but you never know so we are both going to check ourselves in two weeks, like her counselor at PP told her.  I'm buggin out, she's buggin out, not a good thing.  She needs to some food to put in her system, so we go to the store and buy some stuff to make at her house... i cook up some eggs for the three of us and once we're chillin on the bed, F finds the condom wrapper, but we don't tell her what happened that morning before she woke up...  I end up leaving her apartment after drinking mimosas all day, we have plans for dinner and decide to meet back at 8pm, but she tells me she needs to speak with someone and if it's ok if she tells F, i want her to feel better so i agree... 8pm, Saturday night... up to now, despite the horrible episode of waking up and rushing to Planned Parenthood, is fine, it's actually, really really fucken nice... we decide on sushi, have a couple of drinks at her place and head out... oh, i bought her a bottle of Vouve and a bunch of roses, something that i can't remember doing before (the roses part).. dinner was wonderful, and i spent last night there also... Sunday morning, L is a little scared of having sex again, understandably, but, after making out for about an hour we try again, and can you fucken believe it?  the fucken condom slips off again but this time we've been paying attention... what the fuck?  something HAS to go wrong always?  but whatever, we're working on seeing if the ones i use work so she's out at target today getting some of mine...  now, i've used condoms all my life and yeah, they've slipped off once or twice but fuck, three times with the same person???? thats a little odd, don't you think? In anycase, i'm not scared of her being pregnant or getting some std, i'm sure she's clean (if you knew her, you'd trust that statement) but we're getting checked in any case i'm just scared, that everything is so good, and that something cataclismic will occurr, and i hope it doesn't

      wednesday, FH called me around 10pm to come to her place and smoke a bowl, I've been trying to hook up with her roommate LAS and I wasnt doing anything, so I came over...  so we smoke, and F tells me that she's spoke with L and told her    that I was coming over, L was out so she said she'd be coming home soon.. so whatever, L came over, F went to sleep and I stayed up drinking with L, we got cozy and she let me kiss her...  for some reason, her snobiness, baby-talking, and self centered, only-child, daddy's little girl attitude is a turn on, it goes hand in hand like her pointy high heels and her gucci/designer bags.. here's the thing... friday night i went out with the usual gang after work, and F and L said they'd meet up with me around 10 coz they were having dinner with some friends from Miami in the North End... so they show up, and L and I are having a great time, we tried finding some blow but my hook up had left to another bar down the street and he wasnt picking up his phone..  we left to this other bar in Allston, more drinks, more shots, we walk back to F/L's house and smoke some, so by this time, we're pretty fuzzy... i proceed to take off my clothes in the balcony, coz you know, that's what people do, and knock out on L's bed.  I wake up in the middle of the night, and i start spooning L. except it wasnt L, it was her friend's boyfriend. funny thing is I think he was liking it. in any case, i left in the morning, and everything was peachy peaches with L, it was so fucken cool. i sent her a text saturday night that said "x's and o's", no text back, so then i called her on sunday night.  no answer. so this morning F comes into work and tells me that i should chill out with L coz texting and calling at night (11pm) is not cool.  weird.  but later on i learn that F had just broken up with her boyfriend, and after IMing, L said it was no big deal, and we decided to meet tomorrow for lunch. now, in my previous blog i'd said 'lets see what disaster happens'.  so now i'm waiting, it turns also that L just got out of a long relationship, 3 years i think,  why do i get the shit end of realtionships?  if i'm the rebound guy again this is gonna turn out to be quite a fucken year.   so we'll see.

      this used to be another blog, but now has become a new one... word to the wise - don't give the link to  any  of your friends, none, no one, i learned this the hard way, and i swear, wont repeat the same mistake,  also, this is not a Pink Floyd site, as much as i like the pinkness this is not a dedication or reference to them, rather, it is meant so signify my seperateness to others, though trust me, it's not that deep of a thought, but i had to come up with a name f0r this this thing...  ok
