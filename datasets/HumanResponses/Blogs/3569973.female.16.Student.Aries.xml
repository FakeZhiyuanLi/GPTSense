       OMG...I just dont think that I can hold it in any longer. Its just that I have all these feelings running around at once and I just dont think that I can take it without being able to just let it all go on someone and considering the fact that I dont have anyone to do that to...then Im just gonna let it out on everyone! I cant take being in this house anymore, its like no matter what I do here I get yelled at for it, I cant take the fact that me and my friends are not anywhere near close to being how we used to be. I cant take the fact that I cant see the people I love when I would like to see them or need to see them. I cant stand having to look for a job all summer, cause thats not how your supposed to spend your summer. I hate the fact all of my summer plans were ruined. I hate it that I have no money to pay for my car and no job to help me with that. I hate that when I do what Im told or asked I still dont get anything out of it for me. I cant stand how people are two faced, rude, and judgemental. I cant take it anymore and I just have to let it out. I MISS THE WAY THINGS USED TO BE!!! All I want to do is have it all back. I want to be able to graduate and not worry that to many things will change. Like losing more of my friends and all of us forgetting each other, or me not being with my boyfriend anymore like we talked about how we would be. Or worrying about where im gonna get the money to go to college. I dont wanna have to worry about any of this stuff anymore. Its to much all at once, I mean I knew that we would all have to grow up sometime, but I didnt know that it was gonna be this fast. I didnt know that I was gonna have to be making all this important choices all at once and the worst part is I dont have my good influence there to help me make these choices anymore. I have to do it all myself, while helping someone else make there choices for them. Its just way to much to do and its to hard. I just wanna be able to drop it for a week...all of it...and not have a single care in the world except what im gonna eat next or what im gonna wear. Just one week...

       Well theres not to much to do today cause its raining. So today I just decided to sit at home and clean for the most part of the day...I cant help the fact that im a neat freak. Then I went up to Royal Pizza after Danie called me and told me to go up there cause they were hiring...so I did...wish me luck. Although I really dont want a job that bad, it would be great to have extra money, plus the fact that I have to pay for my car, insurence, and gas...kinda sucks so I mean I wont have that much extra money...when it all comes down to it...Ill probably only have like $10. lol. But what can ya do. Well thats all for now I think im gonna go find something to munch on and watch a movie.

       Well Im soo tired of looking for a job...no one really hires when your 16 and this summer was supposed to be fun...but it hasnt been all that much. I mean sure every once in awhile its had its moments, but still I shouldnt have to worry about a job right this second. I guess there are just some things that you just cant have that you want.

       OMG...Now I have 2 jobs! How the crap am I supposed to have a life with two jobs. Its like my parents just dont want me to have a life or be with Jake...ever. And Im starting to wish that I was back in school, because its become where summer is worse than school. I mean tomorrow Im gonna be working 14 HOURS!! How crazy is that. I mean I feel like Im 10 years old except with two jobs. I mean I had more freedom when I was 13 then I do now. I cant stay out past 9:30 on the week days or 11:00 on Friday and Saturday. Meaning I will NEVER get to see Jake again. Well for a long amount of time anyways. Because both Friday and Saturday Ill be at work till about 10:30 EVERY Friday and Saturday. Meaning more than likey no football games, but they might as well just not be open on Fridays during football season, cause everyone in Alvarado will be at the freakin football game. So now that I got a freakin job I have to break a couple of promises to someone that I care about. It really really really pisses me off that I had more freedom during school than during the summer. It also pisses me off that my WHOLE summer gets taken away from me...because they're forcing me to be grown up and Im only 16 FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!! JUST 16!! Ive already got enough stress to last me for the next two years while I have to stay here....I dont think Im gonna make here. Expecially when I have to be home at 9:30...say good bye to parties, or going out, just about anything. I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE.

       Well Im sitting here thinking things couldnt possibly be getting better and your right...they cant...so I guess they decide to go back down. I mean I guess Im just being selfish like everyone says I am and I guess if everyone is saying it then it must me true. But this is where its different. I stop everything in my life and I mean EVERYTHING to make this one person happy, only to find out that person won't do the same. Tomorrow is wednesday and well y'all wouldnt understand. Well this person decides to do stuff stay out late tonight and be gone all morning. When if I would have known I would have done the same, other than not doing the things that I had wanted to do. I guess thats what you get for being a nice person. You still end up looking like a jerk to someone I guess you could say. Which breaks my heart. But nobody knows it but me. I guess you cant always get what you want even if you're trying to please people. Well I just had to complain for a little while and Im sure Ill have some more complaining in the morning like I always do. Till then, Later Days

       LOL...well last night was in a way easier than I thought it would be, but yet, so much stuff that you have to learn in such little time. Its like as soon as I got to work I had to learn about 30 different things right on the spot. I got home and went straight to the phone to call Jake, but only to remember than me and him had been arguing before I left for work. So the whole night (well up until about 12) we argued a little then ended up telling each other all that icky stuff that little kids call love. I missed him so much. Then this morning I woke up and I was ready to get up its just that my body didnt feel like moving. But I did it anyways...took a look in the mirror and almost wanted to throw up at the sight of myself, I gotta start running more. Well Im sure Ill have something to write about later. Considering Im sure there will have to be something that I need to write down after going to the snowcone stand and bible study. Until then, later days.

       OMG...this weekend was THE BEST!! Friday I got to spend the whole night with jake, then saturday I got to go shopping for the wedding that night, then we went to Casey Walravens and Abbys wedding, which me, Jake, Clint, and Jessica has a little bit too much fun at. Then me, Jake and his mom stole fish from the wedding which ended up spilling all over the car and me and Tracy ended up leaving jake at the stop sign. I didnt end up getting home until about 1 in the morning. Sunday I woke up early and went and got ready at Jakes and went to his family reunion...which really wasnt the best thing ever but that didnt matter cause we spent most of the time feeding the ducks (and watching them mate....which believe me was an experience of a life time)plus we got the play with lukes new baby and Faith...then we went back to jakes where we were supposed to go swimming, but yet ended up reading Harry Potter and sleeping. Then today I left and went up to Royal Pizza and got a job!!! OH yeah...rollin in the money and free pizza!! LOL. Plus I still get off on sundays which is perfect since thats mine and Jakes day anyways, but its no big deal cause now he doesnt have to sit at home when Im working cause he got a job today to. Well thats all I have for now...So Ill still be bored until I go to work tonight at 5. Till then, Later Days

       I wanna be able to write down what Im thinking but I cant write it to where it would make sense. Its funny to me in a way how everyday I thrive off coming to this very same computer desk just to write down what Im thinking. Its weird how to me in a way its like a journal except everyone gets to read it, which is weird because I cant stand when people read what I write down...I dont know why I do...maybe because in some since its attention. Funny...I try to hide myself but yet seek attention...I never really understood why I always wanted what I didnt or couldnt have.

       Things now are at a steady pace. I found out that H.F.H isnt this week its in a couple of weeks, so today Im gonna clean and then go to Fitzwaters for bible study. I gotta vent on someone. So I'll try to vent on you people. Well theres this problem and you wanna tell this person that means a lot to you, but you cant, because you dont know how they will react. You see maybe you see this person all the time or maybe you dont hardly ever get to see them at all. The point is you just cant bring yourself to tell them. The sad part is...its eating you up inside and you dont know how to fix it, cause when you try they just snap at you, or ignore what you said, or dont even really care...what else is sad is that they dont understand that your trying to fix something thats very important to you and they arent willing to do the same thing or understand. So I guess this one thing that you wanna tell someone you cant because maybe it isnt the right time. Who knows when that will be....The point is this, you cant run from your problems forever, you cant change things only help them out, you cant say you want to do something about them and miss every chance just because your scared. I guess there are just not enough brave people in the world and not enough to stand up for the ones who arent. But there is one person in the whole situation that I would like to thank for all of there help. The characters will soon know who they are in life, what postition you where ment to play, and who you really are inside.

       Today I finally get to slow down. This is the first time I have actually got to sit down and write all week. Ive been so busy its unreal. Monday I was working, Tuesday I was cleaning, Wednesday I finally got to see Jake for a couple of hours, Thursday I was working at a different place, Friday I went to work at Royal Pizza, Saturday I finally got to see Jake again, but then I had to go to work. Now FINALLY Sunday. I dont have to worry about a thing. But Monday it starts all over again. Except this time I only get two days off...Tuesday and Sunday. Its crazy, but now atleast I got a lot of money which is fine with me. I cant wait to go to bible study this week, there is just to much for me to hold in and I gotta let it out. Plus I havent seen Lauren or Fitzwater all summer. So I miss them. They finally will get the see the 4 kittens I saved. LOL. Sometime which if im not mistaken Tuesday I get to go do Habitat for Humanity and then go to bible study which is gonna be great. Then since Im doing that on Tuesday If I have Thursday off which I think I do, Me and Jake and some other people get to go to Hurricane Harbor. This week is gonna be great...hopefully. Well I gotta go take a shower. Till then, Later Days

       OKAY, it seems as if I hardly ever have time to write anymore. Well lets see...Tuesday...I went and saw Terminal, Wednesday I had to take the THEA at Hill college and then went to Jakes for a little bit before I had to go to work...which SUCKED!! Then I came home which sucked a little bit more, just because I was stressed out about that stupid test and having to work with a certain someone. So I ended up taking a really long bath to releave so sort of stress. Then yesterday, which was Thursday, I woke up, took a shower, and went to burleson. I was looking for a job and then I saw ROSS and I love that store so I went in and shopped and got some really really cute pants and this real nice shirt and both of them we're only $11, I love shopping there because I can always save a bunch of money, like last week when me and Jake went a couple of days ago...I only ended up spending $30 on a Nine West wallet, Steve Maddens, a really cute skirt, and two nice shirts. I was very proud of myself. Then after I came home from burleson I cleaned my room up and waited for Jake to get off work. Then my mom told me that I could finally paint my room and that we could go this weekend to look for the paint (even thought I already know what colors Im getting) Then I ended up going over to Jakes to show him my new clothes and to pick up some papers I had left there. OH yeah I forgot I need to get my jacket that I left. (mental note) Then today I woke up kinda late because I didnt go to sleep till about 1 because I had all this energy and I was working on Jakes graduation present and I was going through all of these old pictures. Then I finally got dressed and went looking for a job again which didnt take long cause I only had to go to two places and they were pretty close. And now here I am bored. Im not gonna be able to see Jake today because he doesnt get off work until about 6 and thats when I have to go to work...but maybe I'll get to see him a little bit after work if we go up to Sonic or something. Then tomorrow I gotta go get my oil changed, and me and Jake are going to my Dad's house to have this 4th of July thing were we have this huge water balloon fight and theres tons of food and then we have to leave that afternoon so that I can go to work. Then when I get off work I will hopefully get to stop by Jessicas new house, (hopefully if I have any gas) then Jake is supposed to pick me up because I promised him that I would come to his house for fireworks and stuff after I got off work. But well Im gonna go finish my movie. Till then, Later Days

       Okay first I gotta catch ya up on this past week...Wednesday I ended up coming home and cleaning somemore then going to Jakes until I had to go to work. Thursday me and Jake ended up being the only ones who went to hurrican harbor but that didnt matter because it was really fun, I even learned how to seriously swim, even though it was only in 8ft of water...it still counts because I stayed above the water the whole time for about 5 min I swam whith no help and then we went back to his house. Friday we went to go play golf which was actually fun...I think it was only fun though because I got to drive the golf cart, then we came home so that I could go to work and yes of course ended up back at his house, saturday...I went to get fireworks with Jakes whole family and then ended up leaving later to go to work and of course back to Jakes. Yesterday I learned how to change a tire and all that stuff about my truck and then me and Jake ended up going to wal-mart and taking about 5 hours to finish with his front and back yard, but thats okay because we got paid for it. Then today I had to take that stupid practice THEA and Im supposed to be looking for a new job today but its raining pretty bad and I dont want to look really bad when I go in and ask hey are you hiring, ya know. But I think that me and Jake are still going back to ross because I found a really really cute wallet there that I like a lot and he found some really nice pants that he likes. Now if you didnt understand why the title of this blog was the way it was. Its because if you cant tell Im at Jakes a lot...not just because I want to see Jake all the time but because I love his family, his family feels more like family to me than my own sometimes, his family understands a lot of the stress Im under right now, and his home even if its not the best in the whole world...feels more comfortable and more like home. Well thats all I have right now...Till then, Later Days

       Well...lets see today I went out to Burleson to eat, which I saw Mikca and her new car...and then me and Jake went to Ross, first it was just to look for him some new pants, but then I ended buying stuff even though I shouldnt have. Then we went to Khols were I ended up buying stuff that I shouldnt have again, but I had the money and ya know...its clothes. Then I came home and got ready to go to work, which was actually alright today. Then I came home and mom told me that Chicken Express called and wanted to know if I could come in Friday. So I was like sure why not, ya know. But the thing is Im probably gonna end up working two jobs, which I really dont need to do, but ya know...its money. And I like money. So tomorrow Im going up to Cleburne to see if anyone is hiring there, JIC, because maybe Ill find a clothes store or something to work at thats really good and then I wont have to work at either of the fast food places. Which would be great. Then that afternoon if Lynn can get the boat to work, we're gonna go out to the lake. Then tomorrow me and Jake are gonna go to Arlington to the mall there to watch The Notebook and look around for a little bit and get something to eat, which is alright and everything, but I was more excited about wearing my new clothes. LOL. Oh and hopefully when he starts to work again he'll take me to this real nice place I told him about in Fort Worth, which by the way you should try sometime, its called Italian Inn something or another, super nice, so hopefully before then Ill be able to be a super nice dress. But well then saturday Im going to Fitzwaters, because monday was her birthday, so if you get a chance and ya talk to her...tell her happy birthday. Then I gotta go to work at 6. So well I guess thats all I have for right now, or atleast thats all I can think of. Till then, Later Days

       Well I woke up really late today, I guess just because I knew I didnt have anything to really look forwards to, but what can ya do. It also might have been because I was up until about 1 last night watching My Girl and working on something. Well today I have to go to the Candle Shop and I think Im gonna clean the house today. I cant wait until next weekend when I can finally paint my room. Its gonna be great!! All the old stuff is leaving and the new is coming in! lol. Just gotta wait until Jake is a little bit better...lol. Well I think I might get up in a minute and start cleaning the house and then take a shower. Till then, Later Days

       Well on Saturday we celebrated the 4th of July even though it was the 3rd. I went and got my oil changed, then me and Jake went to my Dads house and had this huge water balloon fight and ended up having to leave at about 3:30 because I had to be at work at 5. Then I ended up getting off work which I really dont need to do because I need the money, but ya know what can ya do...so I got of work at about 7 and Jake decided that I needed to come over right away. Well I met the ENTIRE family and things didnt really get fun until it was dark. Me, Tracy, and Sunny ended up having our own fun then Lynn decided that I needed to go lite fireworks. So I ended up winning everyone over after they saw me lite 3 canons for about 30 minutes. Then they had this stupid war with roman candles. Jake ended up getting real bad hurt and we had to go to the hospital and we didnt get back to his house until about 3 that morning. So yesterday and today Ive been taking care of him. Well I gotta go cause the phone is ringing. Till then, Later Days

       Well lets see...yesterday...I woke up and went to wal-mart to get my paint and some stuff do go in my room, because Im completely re-doing EVERYTHING....from the lights to well possibly putting in new flooring...I guess it was just time to make a change. In everything, not just in my room. Then I came home and unloaded everything...and me and Jake went out to eat, and ended up paying in just change...lol. Then I went to his house for awhile until my parents got home and we came over to move furniture, wash the base boards, and tape. We ended up finishing earlier than we thought and went to sonic. I ended up having to sleep on the couch, because there was no where else to sleep. Which I never realized how hard it was to actually sleep in the living room. Then I woke up at like 8 this morning and watched some Harry Potter while waiting for Jake to get here so that we could paint.&nbsp; We painted two walls since thats all that we could do today. He went home after awhile to mow and I layed around and went up to work just cause I didnt wanna be here. My parents left and wont be back until about 12. And Im about to leave to go to work to actually work this time. Tomorrow I gotta wake up early again so that we can put the second coat on and move the furniture to wash the base boards and put the first coat on the other two walls. Then we're going to my dads. So I have a long rest of the weekend ahead of me. So well Im gonna go get ready for work. Till then, Later Days.

        Okay well lets see whats happend since the last time I have written. Not really too much...lol...yesterday I went to wal-mart to look for stuff to re-do my room in and I went to work and got off when I was supposed to, and that was about it, today I packed up most of my stuff, I went over to Jakes to play with Faith and to watch movies with her, then I had to go to work and I didnt get out of there until about 10, which is an hour after we close. Oh yeah and I ran in to Jessica, because they got back from their trip and she saw me at work and came to say hi and gave me a present, which was really fun for me because I love getting presents and it was also really great to see her. So tomorrow Im getting all the stuff I need to paint with and my paint and coming home and getting everything out and stuff so that when my parents get off, Jake and just come over and move my furniture and we can start painting, even though thats not what we had planned for tomorrow night, but thats okay. Then Saturday if we dont have time to start painting then we'll do it then and put the sponge color on. Then Im gonna end up having to go to work at about&nbsp;6 I think. So Im gonna&nbsp;be busy for the next two days, which is fine with me. Well thats all I have now, Im kinda in a lets fix everything and clean things out right now mood. So Tell then, Later Days

       Well, I usually wouldnt be on here, but Jake just left to go throw the football with Clint at the school, so Im here with Tracy, which is fine with me, because no matter what there is always something happening here. It feels a lot more like home here anyways. Nothing really happend to much today, except Jake got his tooth fixed so now the only thing wrong is his nose is still broken but you cant tell and his eye which is almost better. So today has been and alright day, I went and got everything from my dads house and later Im going back to make some money at his house for cleaning out this room. So that should be fun because there is all kinds of stuff in there, plus I get money, so ya know. I get to paint my room soon, I just still havent gone to get the paint yet. Well I think Im gonna clean here right now, because its kinda messy. LOL. Tell then, Later Days

       Okay well its been about 4 days since the last time I wrote so now I must do what I do when I miss...update...well Thursday Me and Jake went to Cleburne to look for a job and I bought some flip-flops and we saw the most cutest puppy in the whole wide world. Then we came home and went with his dad to go play golf at Cleburne....and well lets just saw I'm a rebel..lol..Friday I went up to Chicken Express and she was like well the job is yours if you want it, but then she also said that no matter what I would have to work on Fridays and then I would never see a single football game. So I was like hmm....and she said just call me and let me know what you wanna do, because if you want it you can have it. Well then I came back home and got real dressed up and me and Jake went out to the Parks mall to look around until our movie started. So we went and saw the movie, The Notebook. I cried!!! It could have possible been one of the best movies I have seen in awhile, probably because I can compare a WHOLE LOT to it. Then we went and ate at Burger King because that was all we had money for, but it didnt matter because it was the funnest stuff. Then Saturday we went to Fitzwaters birthday party which wasnt that much fun until the five of us got in the pool and played volleyball, which me and Jake won...lol. Then I had to go to work, but it was okay because I found that I get to close the store all by myself next Saturday. Its gonna be fun. Then Jake came and got me so we could go get something to drink, which I ended up getting a whole lemon since mom wont buy me any. Then we came here and watched this stupid show with my parents. Well then yesterday, which was sunday, we got up SUPER EARLY and went to burleson to look for tubes so that we could go to the brazos. So we went everywhere and then ended up going out to Mansfield to my dads house to find that he had some that we could use, but Jake still ended up buying himself a shamu and a paddle. LOL. So we got everything packed up and met up with Danielle and everyone to go. We got there and got in at about 2:30...well we didnt get back until 8!!! It took FOREVER! Then on the way back we just tied down shamu's tail so we were driving down the highway and he FLEW OUT!! So we turned around and got him and took some pictures. Then we stuck him in there with us and this is a huge shamu. So we stuck his head out the window and everybody was looking at him!! LOL. Then we went by the snow cone stand only to find that it had just closed and the Snow Cone Lady opened it just because we had a big shamu. I was sooo tired when I got home. I slept for almost 12 hours. So here we are. Now I just have to get up, clean my room, dust, and take back this big tube to my dad. Soo I think Im gonna go lay down for awhile...Till then, Later Days

        Okay...I woke up at about 9:30 this morning thinking that I was going to a movie at about 12...well that didnt happen...because "someone" had to be back in time to watch his "favorite tv show". So instead I woke up cleaned some and tried to put some of my room back together. Then at about 12:30 we left and went to Cleburne where we were supposed to get coffee and to get a&nbsp;puffer fish. Well we forgot about coffee, they were out of puffer fish, so we got fried pickles instead. We went out by the lake and ate the fried pickles, went to his house and watched "his favorite tv show"...when we realized that maybe we shouldnt have eaten the fried pickles, because we both threw up. Then he got ready to go play in the scramble and he brought me home...so while I was waiting for him to come home...I started hanging things up and stuff. Then I went to the Family Dollar store to look for like one of those rugs ya know that ya hang on the wall for decoration, but they didnt have any...so if you know where any are...give me a call or just IM me. Whatever works for you. Then I came home...worked some more...got tired, gave up and laid down and watched some TV. Then at about 9 Jake came over to see my room so far, and he left...so then I watched some more TV. Which brings us to here...Im soo tired...yet again and my stomach still kinda hurts. So Im gonna go talk on the phone some, make down my bed, and then pass out. Till then, Later Days.

       Okay, well I have a lot of catching up to do since I havent written since sunday...and look its already almost thursday. Okay...monday...lets see...Im really not sure what I did monday, the only thing that I can remember was that I finished painting and went to Jakes Aunt's house to see her new baby...but thats all I can remember, so lets just skip over that day and go to tuesday. Ahh yes tuesday I do remember tuesday. I ended up waking up at 6 that morning and went running at about 6:30...realized I was out of shape and was back about 15min. later...lol. Then I went back to sleep woke up when Jake called and waited for him to come over here so that we could go to cash my check in and go to burleson looking like we just got out of bed, which we had just done. We went looking for furniture and a new mattress, which this guy was gonna end up selling to us for $300 less than the regular price, so he gave us his card and we never went back, even though this was the nicest bed I have ever laid on in my ENTIRE LIFE!! Then later I came home and Jake went back home and then went to play tennis...so Sarah, Jessica, and Brandy came over to help me move my furniture and stuff and then we went over to Sarahs. At about 9:20 we went to Brandys and then to the wal-mart in Cleburne...OMG I havent had soo much fun in awhile. We went EVERYWHERE!!! It was a blast I havent laughed soo hard in awhile. Then we were home at about 11 or 12 or something like that and were up until like 2 when we finally passed out and woke up about 7 hours later. Jessica found that I talk in my sleep and its amazing that she just now realized it...lol. Then we went out to Panchos only paid 2.99...lol...its a long story...got full....almost threw up...and its was soo much fun. I came home at about 4 to kinda put things up and to get ready for work (which I was almost late to). Then got home at about 9:15, watched the last show of The Ultimate Love Test...which is one of the most AWESOMEST shows ever. Took a shower, watched Friends...and here we are. So since I finally wrote down all of that meaningless crap that your gonna read later for you entertainment...Im going to sleep. Till then, Later Days

       I cant take it any longer...ya know I thought that I could take her yelling at me and her treating me like I was 12...so I ignored what everyone said about her being soo uptight...but ya know...its true. I know that I should talk to her or say something...but shes pushing me...pushing me to do things that later she'll regret, because all I have to say is, 2 years, Im out on graduation night. She always tells me that I think the world revolves around me and shes wrong...she thinks its revolves around her and if she doesnt get what she wants shes gotta get mad and take it out on me so that Im the one that has to suffer with her. Shes just trying to make me grow up to fast, just because she had to. Just because she had to miss out on fun doesnt mean thats how I should live my life. You would think that would mean she would want me to have a great life..but no I get dragged down, yelled at, told if I can spend my money, who I can be with, If I should be on the phone. She doesnt realize how much worse this is gonna be on her in the long run. Because if things keep going how they are...Im gone...I dont wanna say it, but Jakes family already wants me to live with them anyways, they say Im forced to grow up to fast and a bright kid like me deserves to have atleast some sort of fun in my life. But nope...not me...I dont deserve anything, Im forced to go places I dont want, do things I dont want. You would think she would understand that if she just loosend up that I might actually be around more. I guess I know where I get my "the world revolves around me" from. Takes one to know one is what I like to say. Its funny to me how people say the know and understand but have no clue. Just because there life sucks they have to drag everyone else down with them. I mean Tracy feels more like the mom I should have, I also hate to say that, but&nbsp;I mean geez...everyone should have atleast one moment of fun in there lives. Thats okay though...2 more years....parties, no curfew, no worrying about money, no more being quite, no more...STRESS!!! IM JUST GONNA LET EVERYTING GO!!!! Im just gonna let it all go...Im gonna step outside scream as loud as I can and thats when you know...IM OUT! Im gonna live my life everyday how it should be lived...not worrying about what time it is or a schedule or being quite or having to do this before then...nope NOTHING! The people you think would most understand, dont know a thing. They're the ones that are gonna get hurt later and not even know it...so all I have to say is I hope the people this was ment for read it and understand instead of throwing things out of proportions. Those 3 words are everything to me... 2 More Years

       Okay...well Im gonna get ya caught up on whats been happening since I never really had a chance to talk. Well wednesday me and Jake got in this huge fight, over nothing, I was just really moody and really mean and I told him that I didnt wanna deal with him anymore. Then we both left and didnt talk to each other until about 9:30 that night, when I called him an ass and told him to come get his stuff. Well he came over and we sat in the driveway crying in the rain for an hour. Realized we were both stupid and that things had to change. I guess you could say the curse is the cure. Like that one song, ya know when they say that...and You dont know what you'd do if you lost it. Its true, that boy drives me insane, but at the same time is one of the only people that knows me and can make me actually happy, we drive each other insane. So he went home and we talked and talked and cried and talked...I ended up going to bed at about 1:00am with a terrible headache, an upset stomach, and weighing 3 pounds less. lol...which was the good part. I woke up with my eyes swollen from crying soo much and went to Jakes at about 11 to fix stuff. We got there and laid around, watched movies, ate, cried and talked some more. Then finally decided that we needed to get out of the house and we went to go ride bikes for about an hour. Thats how long it takes to get around the short block. It was soo much fun and I felt tons better when we got back. We saw soo many nifty things...like we got to see donkeys do it, an armadillo run (after we chased it), we called cows (and it actually worked), almost fell off a bridge (but it was just a stupid do you trust me game), and got chased by dogs. It was an exciting adventure. We came back ate dinner and went back outside so that Jake could teach me how to play golf. It was actually pretty fun. We danced when we got to my house and we talked until it was super late, which we hadnt done in a long time. Then today, I got up picked some stuff up around the house and made it look desent. Took a shower, did my hair and left. I went to get gas, and then went to burleson trying to look for a job...but that didnt really work out, but I did get my shirts so that I could start working on mine, and got some christmas presents. (i like to shop early) Then came home, realized I forgot to go to wal-mart and now I gotta try and get Jake to take me back there later tonight. So whenever Jake gets back from the lake with his dad and Luke, we're going to the driving range so that I can practice and then we're going to play putt-putt. I cant wait because I havent played in forever. But well Im gonna start working on some things that I wish I could tell you but cant. lol. Till then, Later Days

       Well I woke up this morning pretty early, made some little pigs in a blanket, ate a peach, and put away the dishes. I feel tons better today. Except that I have to go to work, which shawn, christine, and sara stopped&nbsp;by the other night, I was soo happy to see them. I think Im gonna just clean some today and do some extra chores for some more money for sunday. Im still working on my room. I havent gotten the fabric yet because I have had the time or the money or the gas. So I'll do that some time this week so that I can atleast get started working on that. I got asked to go to the movies last night, which made me happy to know that Jessica was thinking about me atleast, but in the end made me sad because I had zero money and like always I have to be home at 9:30 on the weekdays...so usually when I have to work I try and leave as fast as a I can so that Jake can take me to get a drink somewhere real quick while we race against time to get back. lol. I think later Ill get a movie and go to Jakes...well actually I think Jake will get the movie cause I have no money. Then I gotta be at work at 6 tonight and thankfully I dont have to work anymore for the rest of the week. But at the same time thats not good, because I need the money super bad and when school starts Ill have like zero money. Friday I think me and Jake are gonna go play Putt-Putt, because either saturday or sunday we're going to my dads to clean out this room for money. But Im not for sure yet. I wish I just had the time. Well now Im mad again, because of stupid people...so instead of writing everything down I think Im gonna go yell for awhile...Till then, Later Days

       Im soo...BLAH today...I dont wanna be here but I dont want to get ready to go anywhere either. I just wanna go. I dont feel good at all and Im freezing. I seem to get mad or upset real super easy. So since Jake is here, I just take it out on him since he is the one that puts me in a bad mood half the time today and its only 3. I think that I might blow dry my hair and stuff and go pick up my check and put gas in the truck...but then I have to put on desent clothes and I really dont feel like doing that either. I think I might just leave and go to cleburne and watch a movie or something or just go to wal-mart and walk around. So well I guess thats all I have right now...just felt like I needed to talk to someone is all and yall are always here to listen...so ya know. Till then, Later Days

       It always seems as if I never have time to write...or am just to lazy to. Friday...I cleaned the house and put my room together, well most of it, ran a set of 24s, then Jake came and got me so we could get pizza than we went to his house to eat and for some reason I cant remember what we did...lol...Im totally blank...oh yeah oh yeah...we watched The Sixth Sense...and I remembered why I stopped watching it..Then Saturday I went to Jakes and we started making shirts (for football) and we went to pick up food from chilis. Then I ended up having to go to work at 5 and happily got off at 9 and went back to Jakes to work on my shirt. Which brings me to this MEMO   If you would like to be part of the Indian Pow-Wow this football season...then let me know so that you can get a shirt. Indian Pow Wow Shirts are $10. So just let me know your size and what name you would like to have on the back. It will take two days for your shirt to be made unless I can start in the morning....than just one. So if you need one call my cell (817) 909-7194 or IM me.    Then Sunday I went to wal-mart with my mom and I got this cute new hat and some school stuff. Then I went to Jakes to finish my shirt...even though its still not done because we ran into technical difficulties with mine. lol. And we went out to the lake on the boat for a couple of hours. Came home and we watched this show on KERA...lol. And we played "steamroller" lmao. Then eventually I came home. Today I woke up early for some reason at about 8:30, finally got out of bed at 9, drank some soup, and ran a set of 12s. Now here we are...bored and waiting for Jake to get done working out....then if you need me later I'll be at work from 6-9. Till then, Later Days

       Well I couldn't go anywhere today until about 12:30 because my mom ended up taking my car to work with her, so imagine my suprise when I went outside to get in my car and found that it WASNT THERE!! lol. Well that didnt really bother me because I needed to clean the house anyways because I hadnt this week, but ya know. So I cleaned and got ready to go with my mom when she got home so that we could go back to school shopping. We were out until about 3:30 when I came home and got ready to go out with Jessica and Brandy. We ended up going to see Little Black Book and ran into Clayton. So while we were out in the parking lot we decided to go ahead and decorate his car with window chalk. Then we headed to wal-mart to get some more window chalk because we were all out. While we were there we ended up turning a few heads...lol...I mean come on 3 girls in mini skirts at 10:00pm in the car parts section. We had some weirdo guys follow us when we were leaving and then some guys yell at us in the parking lot in there car. Then we went back up to the movies to see if there was anyone else there that we knew so that we could write on their car. Well there was no one really, it was pretty dull for a friday night, so went went to Burger King to eat and I think the people there got tired of us, but it doesnt matter because we one some free food. Its soo much fun hanging out with them, because for the most part I just cant stop laughing. On the way home we had to stop and have a little Fire Drill, because of technical problems...lol. So tomorrow I gotta get up early and then head out to arlington with the parents to go shopping again, and hopefully Ill get my sandals. Till then, Later Days

       Man today was amazing, well except for the fact that someone was late for our date...LMAO. Well ya see I've been up since 6 this morning so I'm going on hour number 16. So right now I'm super happy for some reason. I woke up this morning and well seeing as I already wrote...then ya dont need to know about this morning. Well I left at about 10 after seeing Jake before he left for two days. Then I went on the hunt for a job. lol. You will not believe what kinda places there are out there. I never even realized half of those places were ever there. Well I got home at about 12:30. Then I watched a movie and went to go pick up my dad from fort worth. I got back and Royal Pizza called and asked me to go up there. Well turns out I start work there again when school starts, but I kinda dont wanna work there because I dont wanna miss any football games because this is Jakes last year. Then I came back and worked on my shirts and stuff and cleaned up my room while I waited for a friend to get here, well then we went to another friends house to do some stuff and I actually have never laughed soo hard in my ENTIRE LIFE...well thats a lie...but I laughed alot and talked about things. Well it was great. I came home and am still laughing. I cant wait until tomorrow because I get to go shopping and then I get to get ready to go out with Brandy and Jess to the movies and stuff. Its gonna be great. Things are actually starting to make sense. Things are fun and Im guessing how there supposed to be because I dont have a problem with a thing. Well except with Hypocrites...but thats it...well wait...and stupid people, and people that dont really know things that which they speak of. You would know if you were there...lmao. Its great. Well Im gonna get back to my fun go happy life. But I knew that I would have to write in here now because I wouldnt have time later. So Till then, Later Days

       I haven't been up this early in a long long time. I was awake at 6:00am this morning, I guess I just couldn't sleep. I know its gonna hit me later tonight, but thats okay because Jake isn't gonna be here tonight anyways. Im thinking I have a long day ahead of me. Since I'm so awake right now I should be cleaning so that I dont have to worry about it tomorrow...but I'm not about to do that. I might just go ahead and clean up my room and work on some things that I have been putting off when I shouldn't be, because school is about to start and all. Like the T-Shirts I'm supposed to make and haven't had the chance to. Plus I'm not done shopping yet...lol. It actually feels good to be awake early this morning. Im really impressed with this face stuff I've been using. My face is just super soft. I wish I had money...because even though I have a pretty good amount of money on me right now, its not what I need. I need...well actually I want some stuff that I know I'm not gonna get right at the moment. Then I really need to get my hair colored again, but I just don't ever have the time for that either. But I'm happy, because hopefully tomorrow my mom can get off work so that we can spend the day together or go shopping. I like to shop. I hope I get my sandals. I found some that I really really like, but I don't know if I'll get the ones I found that I really really liked. Thats okay though...Im gonna try to ask my mom if she can give me some more money so when I go with Jake and Tracy to Dillards I can get them. Well I've just been sitting here blabbering about nothing like always. So Im gonna go wake up Jake, just cause I can, then I'm gonna start working on some things.

       Well about 2 months ago I started off saying about the same thing...its time to look for a job. Well Im supposed to go look for a job EVERYWHERE! Like stopping at every single store on BOTH SIDES of the main strip in burleson. How crazy is that...Oh I used this new face stuff today and its really nice on my face...you should look into face stuff...Im not for sure what it was...but what can ya do. Then friday I plan to clean, and go shopping with mom if she can get off work, and then going to the movies  so if anyone wants to go see Little Black Book, friday and well I dont know what time, give me a call.  Then saturday I cant remember. Well today I woke up and went to the South School and helped Tracy with her room for about 4 hours, went to eat lunch, and watched a movie, went to get a snow cone and to drop off clothes at the second hand place. Then back to help some more, went to eat dinner and played Uno. Now Im here and kinda tired. Oh man and I almost died 3 times today...terrible...oh man and I also saw a horse thingy...LMAO...I have never seen one before...it was exciting...lol. Well I guess thats really all I have for right now, just about the same thing that happens everyday. Same stuff, but I love it. Till then, Later Days.

       Today...I woke up kinda late...at about 10:00, I couldn't believe I woke up that late, I guess its because Jake wakes me up during the week and he slept late. I gotta start gettin up earlier since school is starting soon. I cant believe that.  I cant WAIT until the CARNIVAL!! Then I laid around and waited for Jake to go get my movie for me. I cleaned up my room and watched 13 Going On 30, worked on some stuff and then took a shower.  I ironed my hair for the first time in about a month and did my make-up just because I was bored.  I used this new eye liner, but I just dont have the right eye shadow I think...but Im not for sure...I thought it looked good thought and my mom said she like it...then I came home and mom was like well now that I see it more, I dont think I like it that much. I was like oh well thanks whole bunches mom. Well then I went over to Jakes which he was 45min. late...I can not STAND IT when people are LATE!! I always have to be on time if not earlier, because to me when your late, thats showing the other person that your rude and that you think the world revolves around yourself instead of showing that you can be on schedule if you say thats when you'll be. I seriously can not stand it and I also cant stand it when people make last night plans...when they just up and say...oh yeah Im gonna be doing this and Im gonna be gone for so many days...and blah blah blah...I CAN NOT STAND IT!! OMG IT DRIVES ME CRAZY!! Well then after yelling at people, we went back to Jakes to make dinner and dessert and to watch 13 Going On 30. Then I almost ended up going to the hospital because like always we were wrestling and he picked me up and I tried to wiggle out and if I wouldnt have caught myself and if Jake wouldnt have been holding my legs I would have wacked my head on the bathroom floor. Then well...we messed up his entire room and he proved that yes "guys are stronger" so dont get caught in a situation where you cant get away, K.  lol. I came back here and watched the end of The Amazing Race, which I gotta watch later because mom recorded it for me. Then came in here to read this magazine and write in here like always, because its my new place to let things out I guess. Well I guess Im gonna check my mail and read my magazine.

       Well like always I never can just say what I did today, I end up telling you what I did so that you can catch up...So well lets begin shall we. Friday night me and Jake went out to Putt-Putt and I won. Then we went and ate at a gas station...lol...which was an adventure and I didnt get home until 12am. Then saturday I woke up at 8:15 to go to my dads so that me and Jake could clean out the spear bedroom and so that we could make money. Then we went out to eat and came back so I could get some clothes and talk to my grandparents...we came home did...I cant remember....oh yeah I went to Jakes to watch movies and stuff and came home at 1am...woke up at 11am and Jake came over we ended up going out to burleson. Then I went over to Sarahs with Jessica and stayed the night. Then I came home today at about 2 to do my chores and stuff and went to Jakes to eat dinner. Well tomorrow theres no telling what Im gonna do...then later friday if anyone wants to go to the movies we're going to see Little Black Book. But well for now thats all I have to say and Im gonna go to my room and stick the phone to my ear for I dont know how long. Till then, Later Days

       Wow I haven't been on here in forever...well atleast that's what it seems like. Okay well let me catch ya up. Hmm...I'm pretty sure the last day that I wrote was tuesday and now...its....FRIDAY! Okay well wednesday I took my app. to Hallmark, got my pay check, and went to Jake's house to hear Brandon and him jam out on their guitars. lol. Then later I went over to Jessica's to get ready to go to the carnival. So then me, Jessica, Sarah, and Lauren went to the carnival and I rode all the rides...and also felt like I was gonna puke for the first time in well...for the first time. Well then we realized that we were hungry so we left and went to go get a tent from Jessicas sister. Then we went to Mcdonalds to eat. We ended up running into Steven and Chase where, Jessica and Lauren got Steven's car with some red window chalk. LOL...it was soo funny. Well then we drove around and Steven came over to help set up the tent. We ended up not going to sleep until like 1:30 in the morning. The next day was....thursday...oh gosh...oooook...i remember. I took Lauren home and headed home myself to clean the house for the week and to take a shower so that I could leave whenever Jake got there. Well nothing really exciting happened...just heard him play his guitar and then we left. Came home and ended up leaving like 4 times, for I'm guessing just no reason...lol...but I did. Then waited for Jake to get out of practice so that I could go to the carnival. I made Jake ride the Zipper and he got sick and brought me home...so we ended our little adventure earlier than expected. I came home got on here and went to sleep, because I was soo tired. I was suprised when I woke up at 8:30, ran...(which I couldn't believe) and now I gotta clean some more and stuff so that when Jake gets out of practice we could go swim or something before I gotta get ready to go out tonight with ALL OF MY FRIENDS. Which I haven't done all summer. Its gonna be great. I think it's gonna be a lot of fun. So well I guess thats all I have for now...I'm sure I'll write later tonight or sometime tomorrow. Till then, Later Days

       For some reason right now I'm super tired. I don't even have a reason to be tired. Well today I woke up really late, because Jake doesn't have to get up early anymore to go to work out, because they have it in the evenings now. So when I woke up I took a shower and started some laundry and cleaned and got dressed. Then I decided I would go get my schedule and some gas, but I stopped by Royal Pizza first to see if my check was in. Well it wasn't so I got Danie's DL and a note so that I could go get her schedule for her. I went to up to the school when Steven called me and asked if I wanted to go eat with him, Jen, Chase, and Jared. So I left and went to get gas and then was on my way to Burleson. Well when I got there everyone had ended up leaving except Steven because I ended up having to go to Royal Pizza and home before I could head out there. So I went back up to the school with them and headed out to Jakes before he had to go to football practice. When I got there I ended up getting a little show from Jake and Brandon...lol...I dont know what Im gonna do with them. But when they finally get good then I'm number 1 back up dancer...lmao. So then we left and I came home to get some stuff done and realized...life is way to short to give it the cold shoulder. You gotta live, you gotta forgive, and you gotta grow up. Tonight is gonna be fun, I'm gonna get ready to go to the carnival to watch the baby contest and wait for Jake to get there, maybe I'll get a hold of Lauren or something. So I decided today...It's stupid for meaningless things. Till then, Later Days.

       It is the first day of the carnival and I was soo excited when I got there. I mean this is serious my favorite time of the whole year. Today seems soo long...I woke up at about 9...I know I should wake up earlier...but ya know...bump that. Well I did kinda wake up early today because Jake called me at 6am to tell me that he was up and was gonna get ready to go to football practice and then again when he got home. Then we went to cleburne to get Jake his guitar and to go to wal-mart to get some candy for the parade. Then I went back to Jakes to eat lunch and stuff until he had to go to football practice. Then came home and took a shower and hurried to get dressed and my hair dryed and then Tracy came to pick me up so that I could go back over to Jakes so that she could get ready for the parade and so that we could wait for Sunny and the kidos to come over. We got there kinda late and me and Faith watched the whole thing together. I was really excited, but then my butt started to hurt and then I thought that it would never end...so ya know. Then after the parade was over we went to get something to eat and then headed over to Brandons. So for about and hour or so me and nikki sat there and watched Brandon, Clint, Jake, and Justin play pool for awhile. It was soo funny. I dont think I stopped laughing. Then we all headed up to the carnival and watched the queens contest, which my cousin, Jennifer Masters was in. It was neat seeing her up there, next year is Kellys turn, and then mine...lol. But well it was fun getting to see some people I cant wait, I think this whole week is gonna be great. But well here I am watching TV and dont really have much to talk about...just hope I got someone to go with to the carnival tomorrow since Jake has football practice until 8pm I think. So Till then, Later Days.
