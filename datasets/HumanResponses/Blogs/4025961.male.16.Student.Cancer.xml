      Today's Bumpable Track: Lil Flip - Sunshine  Actually maybe it shouldnt be sunshine, considering I was asleep all day and I didnt get to see my sun.  My Brother and I were watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3, the one where they go back in time to japan to rescue april. Yeah, and I fell asleep.  Fell asleep, and woke up at 10p.m. So I practically missed out on everything today. So I'll keep it short and sweet.  PZ.  Today's Message From Erwin: Vampires are afraid of sunlight.

      Today's Bumpable Track: Atmosphere - Cats Van Bags  Ayyo, today started out like erry normal july day. Me waking up late in the evening, scrubbing my grill, eatin somethin, doin somethin, watchin somethin, crapping.   But today, something out of the ordinary happened. Seems a lady from colorado called, asking for her friend. Well... I was asleep when she called. So I checked my phones missed calls, and called back, to see who it was. Now her, Linette...Lynnette...however you spell it, had a strange conversation, of her talking, and me going, oh word, oh ferreal, oh i see. Now this went on for a solid 5 minutes, until she went...  "Well I can tell youre busy, I'll let you go, talk to you later..."  Now I'm thinkin, HELL NA i jus wanted to kno who called. Well, thats my day.  It's late in the evening now. And I went to the living room to watch some more tapes. And what I found, was a tape from my third grade class back in Fairfield, Ca. 1997 Mrs. Paxton's Third Grade Class H. Glenn Richardson Elementary. Puppet Plays. I remember back in that class, every year, Mrs. Paxton would have puppet plays. And it was our year. We made puppets from that would topple over any sesame street sucka. Man, I was chunky back them. What a pimp... If you know me, you should come over to my house, and we can watch it. And I'll laugh....  anyways, peep this link, GHETTO K.O.  urlLink http://www.muchosucko.com/video-ghettoko.html   Today's Message From Erwin: Kids drink ya drugs, and dont do milk.

      Today's Bumpable Track: Mack 10 & The Dogg Pound - Nothing But The Cavi Hit  aayo, today I woke up at 6 in the evening. To my dismay, I&nbsp;was attacked by a gang of ants, and 3 crews of ...more ants. We suffered one casualty, which probably led to the start of this fight. My plastic red cup, which probably had some tang left in it. He was smothered, so I had to throw him away. Now I followed the escaping ants along the wall, to a crack in the corner. So as anyone else would, I picked up whatever spray was around, and bombed it. I didnt have any glade fresh spray, I was blessed with FEBREEZE spray. So yeah. What a wake up call.  Yep, wasted all my day. I sat around for a while, called a couple friends to see whassup. Turns out I missed out on errything. By nightfall, I realized I had forgotten to mow the lawn. Man, so I put it off for tomorrow.   My brother woke up at 9 today. 9 in the evening. And then he went back to bed. I dunno why.  I havent eaten yet. I'm still hungry.  For your viewing pleasures, peep this.

      Today's Bumpable Track: Mountain Brothers - Paperchase   aayo, before I had left for the barbeque today, I had taken a journey. I read practically all of Eastman & Lairds Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics by Mirage Studios. My love for the turtles has been reborn. I was amazed at how much of their story I had relearned. Getting to re-know Casey Jones, Leatherhead, Triceratrons, Utroms *shout out to krang* and all that other nonsense. Man... Felt Great.   A bunch of missing links were solved as well. From the super nintendo game "TMNT Tournament Fighters", the final boss was Karai. I had no idea who that was until I re-read the comics. I found out that Karai is actually a girl (before I thought she was a very metrosexual man) and she is somewhat of a villain character. She takes over as a Shredder figure later in the series. Also I had found out the origins of The Rat King. Man... Felt Great.   Well back to my day. It was all cold maxin, We had arrived at the facility and I cought a couple hours of sleep before the party started. It seems that my nextdoor neighbors were having a party too. A Classmate of mine, Casey, lived next door, so I&nbsp;assumed it was his birthday. I didn't say much cause we arent really that aquainted and all that jibba jabba. I didn't eat much like I said I would. But later in the evening I took the dive. I slipped into the darkness. And indulged... Junk Food. Even though I didnt want it, I enjoyed it. Man... Felt Great.   So it was 11p.m. now, My cousin arrived to get some grub, then we bounced. We watched Rush Hour, and some parts of Soldier. But yeah, Im pretty tired. Today was a good day. Man... Felt Great.   Today's Message from Erwin: Eating Barbeque Gives You The ITIS

      Today's Bumpable Track: Spenzilla - Keep It Smoothe (Instrumental)   Man, I was wandering around on the internet, and came upon these blog things. So I decided to start one up for your viewing pleasures. But man, now that I've started it, I got no idea what to say. So I'll just say whats on my mind...   I need to clean up. My room just started housing my local pests. Sure you can say I'm a dirty cat, but I wont care. I need to bug my room.   And now, a little something for your senses "black metal ad" click link son... urlLink http://www.users.qwest.net/~skanne6249/Sounds/BlackMetalAd.mp3    On a serious note, as my first blog, I'm going to make this one memorable, I'll tell you about my day... and how dope it was. First off, my brother and me went jogging like we always do every morning. When I had gotten home, I was starving, so I whipped up somethin good to eat, and while it was cooking up, I went back in time and watched a movie, so old school, there wasnt even old school and new school back then. TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: COMING OUT OF OUR SHELL TOUR... now for you non-fans, thats a tape of the teenage mutant ninja turtles concert, with live actors as the turtles. They also had a live actor as Splinter, April O'Neal, Baxter Stockman, The Foot Clan, and The Shredder. The songs they performed were probably on par back in the day, but now, they're on something. Something like crack cocaine. I still enjoyed it. After I finished eating and watching that, I went and walked around the house cause we dont have any cable right now, so really, there isnt much to do. I got a bunch of last generation systems, snes, nes, genesis, obese gameboy. I shouldn't be bored, but having those for like 10 years or longer, you can get bored fast. Even from the fun games. Those timeless classics like Super Mario World, Street Fighter II, Super Double Dragon. Yeah...so I decided to get on the computer and burn more hours from my life. After a couple hours of burning, I was hungry again. So I whipped up something good to eat, once again, and went back in time and watched a movie. X-Men the cartoon series, episode 1: Night of the Sentinels. Now this&nbsp;series is something to make a religion from. X-Men... ah... Memorable scenes include; Morph sacrificing himself to save wolverine with his line: "WOLVERINE! PULL BACK!", and when The X-Men raid the sentinel factory and Wolverine hops on a sentinels back and yells: "THIS ONES FOR YOU MORPH!" and pummels the back of the sentinels neck with his claws. So yeah, I came now and typed all this up for you.   Today's Message from Erwin:&nbsp;Get back to your old roots, watch all your retro tapes. Nostalgia is Bliss

He's one of my favorite rappers ever since I listenned to him about, what 3-4 years ago. And I was going through a couple of his songs, and when I listenned to this song, I was like, wow, how'd he ride this beat. The beat is crazy tight.

      Today's Bumpable Track: Frontline - Uh Huh  yo, my bad about not typing past 2 days. Weekend was iight.  I watched Battle Royale. Its a japanese movie. About kids not listenning to adults, so adults passed the Battle Royale act. Sending a class of kids to an island, where they fight to the death, till one is left. They get a bag of junk, food, water, map, and a random weapon. Some kids get guns, knives, axes, cross bows, pot lid. Yeah, so the movie follows a class of kids and their antics. Some of the asian girls were hot in it. haha. Go-go from Kill Bill v.1 was in there too.  Also went to see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. man, good movie. I dont want to give a detailed review. But there was a lot of comments on racism in the movie. And how racist everything is. Man, its got a dope message. It's also a pretty fuggin funny movie. Must see, any minority HAS to see it. Whitey's you can watch it too, get a good laugh outta it.  Word, postin, 3 wheel motion coastin.  Today's Message From Erwin: Harold and Kumar Go To In n Out ...west coast version
