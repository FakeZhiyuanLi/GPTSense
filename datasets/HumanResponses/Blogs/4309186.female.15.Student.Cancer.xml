        Acts 20:24--  But my life is worthless unless I use it for doing the work addignes me by the Lord Jesus--the work of telling others the Good News about God's wonderful kindess and love.        Unless I am living my life to do the    work of God  ,    then my life is  worthless.  Not sharing  Christ 's  love  with anyone and everyone is something that should make me feel   guilty  . And I can honestly say that it does. Living 4 Christ    24/7  is my title because I feel like I am supposed to live for Him  24/7 !      Galations 2:20--  I myself no longer live, but Christ lives in me. So I live my life in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.       Like what I said in the first one, my life is  worthless  unless I use it to share God's love. Well, I cannot do it alone, so Christ lives in me to   help   me and to   guide   me. Allowing  God to live inside of me , gives me a great deal of  comfort.  How else could you feel more comfortable? Having the Son of God inside your  heart  and knowing that He loves you and would do   anything   for you...that's and   amazing   feeling! And I'm so glad that I get to experience it   everyday!

      My opinion on peoples   faith   is   different  . I dont think that anyone can determine how much faith someone has, and I dont think that other people should   judge   someone elses faith. God is apart of   everyone's life   one way or another.   Mostly   everyone knows who God is and the principles behind Him. I think that the way that people   deny   Christ's name so easily is  wrong , but Im not them, so I cant make their decisions for them. But what I can do, is I can work my hardest to be a Godly   example   so that they can see what the Christian life is all about. Being a Christian   isnt   always   fun  . Yes, there are always the occansionally   disappointment   that we run into and from what I have heard, alot of people   blame God   for their   mishaps  . Well, as hard as this might sound, its all apart of God's   master plan  . God allows some misfortunes to happen, to   test   your level of faith that you might have in Him.   BUT  , know this, God will   never   test you with more than you can   handle  .  Beliving in  Christianity  or  Evolution . Either one that you believe in  requires   faith!   Faith- believing in something that you cannot see.
