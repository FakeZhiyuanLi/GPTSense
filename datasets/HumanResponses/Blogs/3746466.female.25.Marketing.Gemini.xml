      One score and five years… A quarter of a century... Twenty-five... 25.  For some reason, this number holds a special significance, hallmarking an achievement of time.  Distinctive anniversaries are celebrated in the attainment of this epoch.  The “ruby anniversary”, so they say.  It exemplifies how one prevailed the test of time.     For most people, the age 25 gesticulates the dawn of maturity.  It holds the portal to adulthood.  By this time, it is expected that one capable of making solid and mature decisions.  That with the passing of time, one has endured the trials and learned from it; He has conquered adequate achievements to make him strive for more; He has made some mistakes to make him humble enough.   He has gathered enough experience to him make wise.  May 30, 2004 – marked the 25th year of my life.  How time flies so fast. It seemed like it was yesterday that I cried when my mother dropped me off on my first day in nursery… Off I went to college and graduated with flying colors. Now I’m a Sales Executive in an international consumer goods company.  It was not so long ago, so it seems, that I used to content myself playing with my dolls. Now, I’m busy fantasizing about my dream house and asking myself if I could ever have a family of my own: a husband to be devoted to and kids to love, in this lifetime?  Still, I am happy that I have reached this stage.  I have so much to be grateful for in my life…  So much, that I can’t thank God enough.  As I reflect upon my life’s journey, I have seen His signature inscripted in every phase of my life. From the expansive facet down to the most intricate detail, God hand exquisitely wove every thread, every fiber of my LIFE.   I have had several victories.  From them I have learned to set my goals higher.  I have learned that excellence is something I can achieve, and I should always bear – whatever task there is. Mediocrity is something to be precluded. God is always by my side to give me the strength and the power to win.  Along my journey, I have stumbled several times. Sometimes I fell on soft grounds, sometimes on rocky grounds. But no matter how big or small the stubble is each stumbling spot is precious.  Yes, they hurt so much. Every time I bleed the wounds leave a mark. Each scar has its own unique story to tell.  They remind me of the precariousness of life and how feeble I am. On my own, I can do nothing. But I have managed to rise. God gave me the humility to face my weaknesses and accept them.  He has provided me with enough confidence as well to change whatever things I can still change in me.  The experiences I had – the good, the bad, the beautiful and the ugly – have enriched me.  I am what I am because of what I have experienced.  The past has taught me that life is indeed unfair, but God is good. I can’t have it all, but God gives me what I exactly need.    What might have been “chances” in my life are certainly God-engineered circumstances. God has been with me all through these years, and He will remain to be at my side in the next years to come. Victory, happiness and more blessings I claim!  Next year I will be 26, then 27, 28, 29, 30 and so on…I might be able to reach until 100? Who knows? … But I’ll never be young again. I pass this stage only once. And so for this year, I declare that it will be great!  Because I am 25.

      (my brokenheart's prayer)  Dear God,  I feel so bad. Truly, deeply hurt.  But I know this is for my own good.  I thank you, God, for protecting me.  I admit there are things that I want so badly, yet they might not do good to me.  Thank you for veering me away from it.    Even if it feels painful, I know you are protecting me from a far deeper pain that I might feel in the future.  This situation also reminds me of a much greater plan You have in-store for me - than what I am wishing for right now.  Yet, despite this mindset I cannot deny the sadness in my heart.  Please bring me comfort.  Help me to always look at what what I am bound to receive, than what I have just lost. Let me see things at a bigger perspective - in line with Your will for me.   Amen.

      Hi! Have a seat and make yourself comfortable.... Here, have a glass of Lemonade.   Welcome, friend, into my personal page.  If you have accessed this through my invitation, consider yourself part of the privilege few.  If ever you just came here by chance, consider your self .... lucky? Hehehe =)  You have just entered into a different and unique dimension.  A realm of a deeper perspective of me. An aperture of my soul; the orifice of my heart. This is my vent for voicing my opinions, my feelings, my hopes, my dreams. Things about myself and the world around me that I'd like to share and publicize.    Will be posting an entry or two, once in a while. Anecdotes, personal views, anything in my world. I'm sharing it with you. Here's a peek into my rose-colored glass. Hopefully, by unveiling a part of me I'd be able to move, inspire, motivate and even perhaps help you. That at least in my own little way I have touched someone. This is the difference I want to make.  Thank you, friend, for dropping by.  Feel free to visit me here from time to time!

      Yay!   Finally, an on-line journal site for me. Now, I can have a spot where I can post my views and opinions about myself and the world around me. As for my old-fashioned diary - will still keep it with me.  I could not afford to let it go.  It's where the reccesses of my most intimate thoughts thrive.  I love to write.  Writing is my source of discernment.  It provides me way of understanding things and situations - why it is, how it is, and most importantly how to face them.  Most of my exquisitely made writings are done out from my lowest moments.  Writing is my way of coping.  Writing keeps me alive.  Writing keeps me sane.

      Two weeks passed and still no word from him. Called him once, twice, thrice … a hundred times – still no answer.    We were friends back in college. He was our senior university president, while I was a wide-eyed eager sophomore representative. Popular, athletic, handsome, he typified every woman’s dream leading man. And yes, he lived a storybook life with a dream leading lady as well. Smart, profound, eloquent, I was a figure of an ideal dean’s-lister, a clean-cut straight A’s student. We belonged to the same college. We joined the same organization. We were just friends.    Those past two weeks were a living torture for me. Friends have been counseling me to move ahead. What he did was evident - no need for a conclusive end, so they said. But I’m the one living my life. I know what’s best for me. I need a formal closure… an ending more decent than this. I need to hear his voice for the last time. I need to hear him say, “goodbye”. His voice. Him.    “Hi Rhy, I’m in Manila. Want to meet up?” Came the very first words he told me – three years after we last saw each other.   I had no plans in meeting him. I was consumed with my work. But at the last minute I changed my mind. We met in Greenbelt. Had coffee and hopped on some bars to dance the night away. We had fun..   “Ummm,Rhy? Can I see you again tomorrow?” he asked.   “hmmm… OK. Good night.” I said.   This was how it all began.    How I’d wish he’d answer my call. I want to talk to him, not to spite him, nor to ask why, and not even to implore him for his apologies. I want to talk to him because I want to hear him seal the end of us. I want to talk to him not to win him back. I just want to wish him happiness and love. I want to talk to him to hear his voice … for the last time.    A month after we became a couple. It was fast I’d say. But I knew him since college. Suffice it to say, our times spent together have given me enough comprehension about him, his personality, his being. I never had any attraction whatsoever way back in college. But, the more I got to know him the more I was drawn to him. Our weekend getaways, phones calls, emails have a way of making my once mundane life interesting. He has a way of painting the skies bluer, coloring the sun brighter, making the moon more beautiful, and rendering the blows of the winds more melodious.   He’s the first person I think of when I wake up, and the last person I’d think about before I sleep. I have fallen for him. It’s a risk I’m willing to take. Yes, I love him.    Where could he be? Why wouldn’t he answer my calls? And more importantly, who is she? When I received his message intended for his “hon”, I was crushed. I was shocked. I never imagined he would be capable of doing this to me. Not him. Not to me.  I did my best in making our relationship work. Never did I demand for anything from him. Never did I rant on anything to him. Never did I make him cry. I was faithful and true to him. Never did I lay my eyes nor entertain any idea of being with another man, besides him. He was my world. My everything.    Months passed … He has changed. I have felt that he’s not as sweet and romantic as he used to be. Ahhhh, it’s because of his work. He could be busy and pre-occupied. He is a very driven man with fervent passion for excellence. I must support him. Rhyanne, don’t demand for his time. Rhyanne, don’t complain if doesn’t call – even if he promised that he would. Rhyanne, don’t disturb him.   But what about me? What about Rhyanne? I feel like I’m in this relationship alone. Nevertheless, I still love him. Paradoxical but true. There are times I wish to flee from him. My head says “go” but my heart “no”. There’s something in him that perplexes me, makes me weak, makes me defy my logical self.   In spite of this all, he never fails to make me feel special and loved. I have come to accept his love and whatever he has to give not on my own terms but his. Not on my own idea of love but his.   Is this what they call as the selfless love? At last, I have felt it. Despite the confusion and sometimes the pain … It feels good. It feels warm. It feels Love.    I can accept that it is now over between us. What I cannot accept is how we ended. I’d like to believe that what we shared was something special. And it needs a far more respectable ending than this. He may have moved on in the arms of another woman. But I cannot continue with my life – with unresolved issues buried in my past, more so in my present.   I need to face this and end it with finality. And only will I have it until I talk to him. Might try another call… And Lord, please make him answer this. Please?    Ring….. Ring…. Ring…   Silence. I can feel his presence at the other end of the line. But there was total silence.   “Hi! How are you?” I said, trying to break the ice.   “ Fine.” He said. “And you?”   “I think I am also fine.” I replied.   Silence.   I gathered enough courage to ask him straight out… “Who is hon? Is it who I think she is?”   “Yes.” He answered.   I should have known… I’m so stupid to let their friendship be. I’m so stupid trusting in him. I knew I couldn’t somehow trust her but him… Never expected he’d do this.   “Why? … Where did I go wrong?” I asked.   “Nothing. You were perfect. Everything I asked for in a woman, I saw in you. All the qualities I am looking for in a woman – is in you. We could have been the perfect couple.” He explained.   Could? … My knees were quivering.   “If you say that I am perfect for you, why are you letting me go?” I asked.   He replied, “I don’t know Baby. I don’t know. I guess I feel that I am not worthy of your love. What I am giving you is not adequate with what you are giving me. I feel I have shortchanged you. Baby, there are far more better men than me, who’s far more worthy of your love…. Who could make you happier.”   Mustering enough courage, “Who are you to dictate my happiness?” I asked. “When both you and I know for a fact that it is you who’s making me happy right now. That man you’re saying is you… He could be you.”   Tyring to explain, he said “I tried but I just can’t. I always end up hurting you. And I don’t want to hurt you anymore. I want you to be happy.”   I felt a knife stabbing my heart. I felt my heart bleeding profusely.   “No. this is not the point.” Calmly, I explained to him, “The point here is that you do not love me. You cannot give me the love you think I deserve because deep down in your heart there’s no love for you to give me, to begin with.”   Holding back my tears, I gathered my composure telling him, “How I wish I knew her secret to your heart. How I wish I am her. But then again you wouldn’t love her because she’s me. I’ll just let her be. I wish to hate her but I cannot. She’s the one who makes you happy. Instead I’ll support her.”   Silence.   “Goodbye, Baby….And for the last time, I love you, and again I say, I love you.” I said with held-back tears rolling down my cheeks as I hung up the phone.    It’s over.   This is our story.   The end.

      After a month of silence … I’m back!  Just came right from the airport from our Makati, head office.  Stayed there for two months for a special project.  Now after faithfully and, I’d like to say, successfully finishing my mission there – I’m back.  Back there in our head office, I lived a balanced life.  Meaning, I had the best and the worst moments in my work life so far.  The best part was my first few weeks of stay there.  We were in a training-seminar environment, so the mood was kinda laid back and relaxed. Nevertheless that month of breather was instantly equalized for the succeeding two months… the hell-months, as I would describe it. We were burning the midnight candles working until 3:00-6:00 in the morning, weekends included. More than anything else, beyond the business excellence training; above the new systems training, it was a patience training for me.  But I survived the chase and now, I’m back.   Yes, I’m back. Back here with my local sales team.  Back here in my desk - facing a mountain-load of promotions than needs to be reviewed, implemented and improved.  Back here in my area – handling a myriad of tasks and challenges – including the resignation of one of my assistants.  In the meantime, will be filling that gap until I find a suitable replacement.  Back here in my network with 300++ unread emails. I’m definitely back.  I’m finally back in my home sweet home.  I can’t wait to be with my father and sister when I go home tonight after my dinner meeting.  Would love to hear what news they have for me when I go home.  Can’t wait to spend time with them again.  I missed my family so much.  To be with them again – talking, laughing, arguing, doing silly stuff …  Aaaahhh, feels good to be back!  I’m back with my friends.  We have been exchanging text messages and emails regarding my arrival, planning on trips, girl’s night outs, and other escapades.  Will be meeting them on Friday.  I’m excited to hear about their the latest scoops and gossips.  I’d be thrilled to go man-hunting with my other single friends… Hmmmm, sounds fun to be back?  Oh no, I’m back!  I’d be facing the reality of being back… now without him.  I was very thankful for my stint in Makati.  I was immediately transported to a new location, with no whatsoever memories to remind me of him. I was provided with a different environment to muse over my attention.  I was surrounded with several associates – old and new alike – that has given me a fresh milieu to divert my thoughts away from the pain and confusion. The hectic schedule provided a welcome respite for me to veer my thoughts away from him… But now I’m back.  Funny … or should I say, sadly, how one man has depopulated my world.  It feels miserable going back, knowing that a significant part of me has gone.  It feels lonely. Empty. I feel a void in me, coming back.  If only there’s an opportunity for me extend my stay in Makati – I would.  But there is none.  Now, I am forced to come to terms with reality.  I can’t forever run away from it.  Sooner or later I'd have to face it. But the time for me to face is now. Sigh, I’m back.  I may be back physically in my hometown but the real Rhyanne hasn’t… And she’s not yet even home – still. Let time be my healer. Let God be my strength.  I am praying for the time to come where I will just look back into this and smile instead of cry, laugh instead of scream, remember instead of ask… Until then can I say that I’m back and I’m finally – home.
