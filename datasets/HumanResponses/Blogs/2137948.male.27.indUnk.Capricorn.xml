      To blog or not to blog or to keep a secret blog.  I'm making the call out here:  Secret blogs are the suck.    If you want a  private  typed record of your thoughts, for whatever reason, buy  Word Perfect  or  Word 2000  (Hell, I'll burn you a copy of either if you ask nicely) but don't have a blog.  Blogs are for instigating conversation  with people  and continuing communication  with people  or to simply  exhibit yourself  to the public at large .  So unless you got a few other people  inside  you then a blog better be for doing all of the above with other people  outside  yourself.    Now maybe I'm missing the whole point of blogging, but isn't having a secret blog like having a walkman but no headphones?  That's dumb.  I'll concede that the blog hunt is an interesting idea but not to me.

      This blog is a...     Maybe once everyone finds the time or the inclination to post regularly to their own blog then there will be something to say here; until then...this is just a place to turn your car around.

      Or rather, what I'm doing.  I am going to make a new blog.  In it, I will confess to all of the idiotic and downright rotten things I think and do.  The catch is, I'm not going to tell any of you where it is.  If you find it, I will fully cop to it and possibly bribe you not to tell anyone else.  Granted this is a bad idea but it's late and I'm tired, and maybe a bit messed up with a cold, and there's nobody around to stop me.

      I am moving out of Bloomington over the weekend.  First stop:  Port.  Next stop:  Chicago.  Visits to Madison will occur in the interim.  Look it's a use for this blog.
