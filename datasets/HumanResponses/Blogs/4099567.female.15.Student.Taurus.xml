       Hm. Let's see. What did I do today? Work. I worked at the Fleamarket. The FLEAMARKET. Oh my God. They grow odd people in that fleamarket. The fleamarket (From this point on i will call 'the forsaken') is swarming with people who don't have enough money to shop in real stores. (Sadly, we're on the verge of becoming one of those people) There was some guy who went by singing "I am one of God's servants, as are we all" to a tune i have NEVER heard in my life. Marquis is taking over my life. I've had to write the newsletter, set up displays, make posters, drum, drum some more, train recruits, drum some more, march, drum some more, switch drums, drum some more...you get the picture. Other than Marquis, i've just had work. There's a dog named Sonny, a little 'weiner' dog, who screams like a friggin banshee every time you walk by him. Stupid little mutt. Definitely should have been castrated. He's bad enough without having THAT thing looking at you. SumÂ·mer: Pronunciation: 's&-m&amp;rFunction: noun Etymology: Middle English sumer, from Old English sumor; akin to Old High German &amp; Old Norse sumer summer, Sanskrit samA year, seasonDate: before 12th century 1 : the season between spring and autumn comprising in the northern hemisphere usually the months of June, July, and August or as reckoned astronomically extending from the June solstice to the September equinox 2 : the warmer half of the year 3 :  urlLink YEAR    4 : a period of maturing powers  Sound it out any way you want, but i'm getting sick of muggy days with nothing to do. I'd much rather be in school with my friends, although i will deny ever saying that in a court of law. Oh, and just to clear one thing up, that guy, "he had it comin'". Love ya, April

      Well, this is how my party went: 11:00am-leave to pick up erin 11:15am-have erin run back for present 11:30am-get to my house 11:45am-go to EGPL and wait 12:20pm-have issues putting on makeup in the workshop...thing 2:30pm-back to my house! Game of boggle (i beat erin. And tracy. And allison.)  We watched The Lion King, Chicago, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (which was TERRIBLE), The Wild Duckie Chase, Three's Company, and a bunch of music videos. My computer COMPLETELY made Martina McBride sound like a guy in slow-motion, along with Keith Uhhhban. We played Scrabble (I won, Erin came in second, and Allison quit. Ashley was the consultant.) Wrote dirty mad libs, wrote nearly-porn stories, dowloaded a dictionary, listened to music, went to the Marquis picnic. We chucked balls at people, played with my rabbit, and talked about sex (baby, talked about you and me. Sorry, couldn't resist.) of course, my mother had a nasty habbit of adding to the conversation. We talked about the gestation period of an elephant and how chicken eggs get fertilized.  At 1:30 we finally went into our room, which used to be my dad's, and stayed up till 4. Oh, I forgot, between the makeup and the picnic, i opened presents. This is what I got:  Erin: School supplies and a gift card to Old Navy Allison: Purse and coin purse of my DREAMS (With me wherever i go!) and a gift card to Old Navy Ashley: 2005 Orlando Bloom Calendar (Replacing the kittens in my room) Tracy: Madlib and hemp-and-seashell-necklace (wearing it right now!) Emily B: Didn't come, but gave me a card and two cds at marquis. She gave me her music, which is like the Dashboard Confessionals and other stuff like that. I was surprised how much i like it! It's not as good as musicals, but close! (Listening to it right now!)  It was sooo much fun! Except for when allison's hearing aid battery died, and we called her mom, and then her mom got mad and grilled my mom, and then my mom grilled us...vicious cycle, I know.  With love, April

      Well, today is the day. My VERY late birthday party started 45 minutes ago when we went to go pick up Erin from her house. She, of course, had to go back inside immediately because she forgot something. Ah well. Allison isn't here yet, not surprising, according to erin, Tracy's getting a ride with ashley, and they're probably lost in North Granby somewhere. Okay, well, I'm at the library waiting for them to arrive. I started a new story. "We: The Undersigned". About this woman who sells her soul to the devil, and then she and all the other sold-souls band together against the devil. w00t.  La'ers April

      Well, today, I was at work, of course, and i cleaned the upper kennel, the whelping shed, and Angel and Demon's cages. I also did the goats and the rabbits and delivered a tire to R&N. Fun. Well, Angel and Demon went psycho when I opened their cage and i now have a gridwork of scratches on my right inner elbow and forearm. Ah well, I love those puppies. I have officially named the bratty Siamese cat Oscar, after the Grouch in Sesame Street. Did I tell you that when i was 5 I starred in a Sesame Street film called "Super Grover and the Wild Duckie Chase" when I went to Sesame Street world or whatever...I had chicken pox. I have the video if anyone wants to see me cute and little.  Well, for the five people that this affects, MY PARTY'S TOMORROW! Erin, my mommy's coming to pick you up at 11:15, and then your mommy can come and get you at our house. Okeeday? Okay. And, Tracy, Ashley, and Allison, meet at the East Granby Library...okay? Marquis will LOVE you...well, with the exception of Ashley, whom marquis wishes dead...they'll love allison, already met erin, and tracy's FROM granby, so.. Love, April

      Yes, so in the last post, I mentioned Cell Phone Girl. Have I mentioned that Bryan hates cell phones with a passion? Well, he does. They had strung a bunch of yellow caution tape up all over the campground so we wouldn't get in the performance's way. Well, we didn't pay attention, and sat on the other side of it anyways. Bryan was sitting next to me, and he was cool...until two middle-school girls sat down maybe ten feet away from us. One of them has a cell phone. Her cell phone rings, and Bryan goes crazy. She's standing like right IN FRONT of us talking, and Bryan's going: "I don't want to hear your conversation. You know that? I really don't. No one cares about you that much. Get over it; you're not that important! Quit talking will you? You're camping. Get it? CAMPING. You don't need a cell phone when camping in the middle of the woods of New York!"  Of course, we ran into her again later, and she thus acquired the nickname of "Cell Phone Girl".  Now, this was a very primitive camp for most of the corps. An outdoor shower, the water controlled from the kitchen, was our only means of cleaning ourselves, and there were no mirrors to be found in the whole camp ground. Fortunately, our life saver, Mrs. P (Lindsay's mom)had a mirror in the trunk of her car.   As for the drumming, WOW. I actually didn't screw up the on-stand performance, especially considering that i learned half the songs we played in about ten minutes beforehand. I did, however, play the wrong strain of Whup Jamboree in the midgetly short parade. I'm serious, we could see the end of the parade from the beginning of it. We were, of course, 17th out of a list of 20 corps...so it took a while. You have no idea how many people gave us a standing ovation and came up to us afterwards, saying that we were the best group they'd ever seen, and telling their kids that we were better than their OWN corps, kinda odd...  Well, Jello. For those of you who aren't familiar with the game of Jello, it's when you take off your seat belts on a car ride (only bench seats work) and smash against the other two people on the varying curves. The entire two-hour ride back from Carmel, we played a very enjoyable game of Jello. Of course, only the drummers (myself, Emily, and Bryan) were involved; the fyfers were talking about getting naked in the back. I had the door side, Bryan had the middle, and Emily had the window side. Now, you have to understand, Emily's tiny. The combined effort of Bryan (6'4) and myself knocked the wind out of her every time. Of course, I kept getting wedged between the seat and the door. The recruits were cheering on emily and I, and were truly afraid for our well-being. "Emily, put your pillow up; we're going to the left!" "April, quick! Put your pillow on the door and lock the door, we're turning right!" It was rather cute. La'ers, April

      Well, I spent the better part of Friday and Saturday at a muster. I must say, it was a LOT of fun. So, I spent much of the ride there disgusted by a complicated tapestry of vomit stories from a fyfer named Jack, but then it looked brighter. We pitched tents, and I must say, the other three girls and I had a very nice tent when compared with the "Circus Tent". The Circus Tent is what the four guys used. It was an old canvas tent colored in a sickly green and acidic yellow with a nice metal crown on top, which was lovely considering the lightning storms we had. The zipper on the Circus Tent was broken, so it was always half shut--it wouldn't open furter or close further. Our tent, a COleman tent was breathable, new, and had a dividing curtain in the middle, much better.   Of course, in Marquis, there's no such thing as a curfew. So we were jamming until midnight, and then the rest of the teenagers disappeared while I was in the bathroom, and left me with the two recruits (they had a curfew, since they're ten). I exhausted all of the card games I have ever known in my life by beating both recruits several times, of course, in their "circus tent", and only escaped when I claimed to be tired and ready to go to bed. In truth, I wasn't tired in the slightest, and would much prefered to be out wandering with Jack, Lindsay, Jenn, Bryan, and Emily. But I disappeared into my tent and re-read The Priestess of Avalon. I got through about 50 pages, when Lindsay and Jenn came back. Of course, i was reading, and listening to music to block out the snores of Jenn's dad, when Emily, Bryan, and Jack returned. I moved my arm and a bag next to me rattled. I hear Bryan (the other bass drum) say "Is that the sound of something delicious?" and i say "What??" and he goes "Oh, I guess not. You would've thought walking 45 minutes in each direction along the road, we would've come across some fast food places." I eventually fell asleep, although only to get up again at 5. I wake up to: "WHAT DO YOU WANT ON YOUR BAGEL?"-mother of someone "I WANT CREAM CHEESE ON HALF AND BUTTER ON THE OTHER!"-child "KATHERINE DOESN'T LIKE BUTTER." -mother "I DO SO!" -presumably katherine "NO YOU DON'T!"-mother "BECKY GETS BUTTER, SO I WANT IT TOO!"-Katherine  And I haven't even gotten into the drumming, or Cell Phone Girl, or the mirror-less camp, or the midget parade, or the outdoor shower...or the game of Jello. We'll save that for another post, this one's long enough. With love, April

      Okay, we'll start with last night. I went to marquis, and I was the only bass, biiig surprise. So, they tell me i'm the only bass for the muster this weekend too. Woohoo. Just havin' the time of my life, here. I need to learn two songs by tomorrow, one of which i DON'T HAVE MUSIC FOR. Sure, easy enough, right? Just get the music off the bus from the magic red bag. Hah. Yeah, tried that. "Welcome Here Again" is nowhere to be found. So Emily, the snare player, tried to write up some music for me. Tried being key word there. Then they made her give the recruits a lesson, and she gives me this frightened look, so I promise to help her. After Steve and Ben leave, she turns to me and says: "I feel so guilty, giving them a lesson. I mean, I don't even know what I'M doing..."  Then I came home, and had dinner. We had those little microwavable hotdog singles wrapped in soft taco shells, because we didn't have rolls. I uh...had an interesting time with that. I sorta didn't know the hotdog would be THAT hot, so i threw it onto my plate from six feet away. Hah. I went to throw away the wrapper from the hotdog, and didn't know there was hot oil in it...it sorta burned me, and i dropped it, my mother laughing at my stupidity. Then I sit back down, eat, and when I get up to put my plate in the sink, my mom bursts out laughing. I say "What?" and she just points at my pants, laughing hysterically. I find that I have sat on a paper bag with tape stuck to it, so that it was hanging off my butt looking like a weird tail. Ah, good times.  Today, i worked from 8:00-1:00...and haven't gotten to take a shower yet. Fuuun. I gave three puppies baths and groomed them. They, of course, like to roll around in their urine, so they smell TERRIBLE and have mats, flees, and dandruff. Fuuun. Well, they don't really like baths. Or nail clippings. Or being brushed.  I learned how to operate a blow dryer today! Normal people use hair dryers on their hair...I use them on dogs...well, I didn't know how to use one, because if you blowdry my hair I come up looking like one of two things: 1.) I stuck my fingers in an electrical socket. 2.) Mrs. Hoffacker.  With love, April

      I just finished the Da Vinci Code, and WOW. It rivals the work of my all-time favorite author, Marion Zimmer Bradley. Dude, the plot twists! WOW. I won't go into them now, because I don't want to spoil it for everyone who hasn't read it, but all i can say is WOW. I'm on the reserve list for Angels And Demons now...that should be good too! This is definitely the BEST book i've read this summer, the second-best being The Lamplighter, by Anthony O'Neill. Dan Brown is SUCH a good author! Maybe in my next life I can be that good... DAMN! I think it may have been better than The Lady of Avalon. How scary is that??  Oh well, i'll stop raving about it. (Read it read it read it!!!!!) I have marquis tonight. That'll be fun! Bye, Ya'll April

      Okay, I would just like to say, if anyone HASN'T read The Da Vinci Code, they don't know what they're missing! I started reading it at 9:30 this morning, and couldn't put it down. I read continually, and am almost done! WOW are there a lot of plot twists! DUde, i never would've expected that a book Schmidt liked would be GOOD. Oh well, Just READ it; you have NO  idea what you're missing!!! With love, April

      Peaches went home today, you know, the psycho cat that took the place of Peach-Demon. To say she went quietly would be the overstatement of the year. SPitting, hissing, and screaming, i managed to stuff her in her cardboard carrying case. Then I gave her, along with her wet catfood and Dr. Seuss 'thing 1' toy to her family...they seemed nice enough for having a brat as a cat...  Right. Today. Wow. I worked 6 1/2 hours. You do the math. 8:30am-3:00pm...not fun. Well, I must say, it wasn't an eventless day. I come, and start on the cages...scrubbing all the panels and the cat litter pans, and even the food bowls with bleach. Ouch. Just look at my arms to see the number of cuts that have been burned with bleach today...ouch. Well, so I finish the upper kennel, Niva did the goats, Joh did the whelping shed, and they both did the two puppies. (The upper kennel takes longer)Then we fed all the boarders, which was easy enough.  Halfway through, my boss sort of blew up at another worker named Kathy. This is what i heard:  "I'm not dealing with this shit anymore! I just can't have someone off-the-walls working for me!"-my boss  That was interesting. Of course I forgot a lunch, and while Joh ate her lunch, I played with the barn kittens. Joh named most of them after Japenese animation characters from some TV show she watches...but she let me name the one we found today, the cutest of them all. I named him Gypsy (That's right, musical bitch strikes again. For those of you who don't know, Gypsy is my second-favorite musical.) He is so cute! Fluffy, dark grey, with yellowish markings around his eyes. He's the healthiest of all the barn kittens, most of whom are sick.   With love, April

      At work today, Peach was gone, but unfortunately, there were three cats in his place. All three of whom were not very friendly. CiCi, E.T., and Peaches (yes, a different cat) were all boarders with tempers. They were CRAZY! One of them, CiCi doesn't like to be woken up. Well, I made the mistake of taking her out of her litter box so that I could clean it. Man, she cut my palm...that wasn't fun. Peaches growled everytime i walked by her cage, and E.T. (Extra Terrifying) hissed every time I looked at him. Little brat. So i didn't bother with his litter box, and just gave him more food and water before he attacked me. Then there was this dog named Belle who was really sweet, but there was also a family with three dogs: Max, a collie mix, Samson, a male St. Bernard, and Autumn, a female St. Bernard. Oh, and one of the little puppies got loose under his cage, so i had to put him back.. Ah well, April

      So today, I cleaned my bedroom. Ha. Normally I just shove everything underneath my bed, but today i actually had to clean. My closet has been used as a dumping-zone for the past few years, so now i got rid of everything that's too small for me, or that's hideous. I found this really cute black skirt that I look TOTALLY hot in, but also this dress that looks like a lampshade. It's dark blue with little white flowers and has a matching sash and bonnet. I disposed of them all immediately. Then I found all these notes I wrote in like fourth grade. They were amusing. Another great day in the life of April. La'ers, April

      I didn't go to work yesterday. Although, I must say, you can hardly be jealous of me, a I was in the hospital instead. Yes, I do get a comfy leather armchair to sit in while I'm there, but that doesn't make up for the four hours that I spend sitting in a room, with a port stuck in my hand to get my infusion. Yesterday, I was the only one in the room, but usually there's someone else in there too. I have a lovely bruise on my hand from where the needle went in. My veins are so weak from years of steroid eyedrops (no, not illegal drugs!) that vessels pop the second the needle goes in. Then the medicine doesn't help, it's clear, and sort of feels cold as it goes through my vein. Then they take the needle out, and leave a little hole in my hand for the medicine to be fed through. I put on my headphones before it started, only to find that my batteries had died, and my mother refused to buy more. So when I got home, I switched batteries with my camera, which worked fairly well.

      Well, I must say, if you thought the hospital was my day in entirety, you are poorly mistaken. I had to bring our couch to my father.  Of course, we have just returned from Hartford, when my mother makes us drive BACK to Bloomfield, so that we can bring our couch to my father's apartment. Well, now we have no furniture whatsoever in our living room. Here's an overview of the room right now: Old stereo and turntable Collection of records and tapes (VERY diminished since my dad took most of them) 2001-model of a Gateway flat-screen computer Computer chair that we got at a tag sale for two dollars Television (old, small, buttons don't work) DVD player VCR (Both cheap and on sale when we bought them) Movie TV (newer, our old one didn't have a DVD port-thing) blue sparkly drumset (second hand, mine of course!) Book case of books I had when i was 5 foam map of the US a game shelf aand that's it Notice that there are no chairs, meaning that we are adopting the Japenese tradition of sitting on the floor. Comfy. Oh well, not like we needed something to sit on, anyways. The floor's good enough for the cat, so it's good enough for me too Love ya, April

      I was at work today (big surprise, I know) when this tortoise-shell cat went psycho on me. Stupid little brat. Her name is Peach, and she's a boarder. She freaked out when I took her out of her cage...she's not normally a sweetheart, but today, she was simply evil. She leaps around in my arms, digs her VERY long claws into my shoulder (I know have a very lovely gash there, thank you very much), bites my arm (where the skin broke), and hissed, flailing in every direction. Stupid bitch. I opened the open cage and chucked her in, screaming profanities at her. I look at the card on her cage and she was supposed to leave today. Who the hell names their demon "Peach"? Isn't that a cute and fuzzy name? Not a name for little piece of bratty fur. Hmpf.  Love always, April

      At work today, there was a boarding rabbit. His name is Popeye. Cute. Well, for name cards for the boarders, we put yellow index cards on clothes pins and attatch them to the cage. This rabbit ate his name card. So I made him a new one. I'm halfway through cleaning the double-cage of particularly heavy and grouchy Siamese cats, when I hear this chomping noise. I turn and the little pest is eating his nametag again! So I move the clothes pin up to the highest hole in his cage, where he can't reach it. Now there are so many bite marks, that it reads  "peye it food ice day" Which is saying something, because it once said: "Popeye Chay, Greens, Rabbit food twice a day." So Popeye the sailor bunny doesn't seem to like his spinage much...he much prefers the delicacy of yellow-dyed index cards. With love, April

      I was at work today, and when I came home, some freak had called and left a message on my machine. Weirdo. Anyways, it's some kid, and he goes "Heeheehee. I am a monkey named Codswallop, and you are my mate. Heeheehee." Then he hung up. Honestly, stupid people are...well...to put it bluntly, STUPID. Oh, and my mother finally said yes to me having a birthday party! For everyone invited (This means you!): Allison Z --Yay you're coming Erin H --Yay, you too!! Emily R--No...:-( Emily B--work, i assume? Jess T--where the hell are you? Tracy S--yay you're coming! Ashley W--Yay you're coming! Jenn G--It's your birthday! So...No... It's at 12-noon on Wednesday, August 18th, and goes until 12 Noon Thursday, August 19th. We'll go to the annual Marquis family and friends picnic, and then back to my house for fun! Please tell me if you're coming soon, because my mom is impacient.  La'ers! --April

           Today, I was supposed to go and visit my friend's calf. I went, and because of a misunderstanding, I was there at 11, and he got there at 12. I waited until 11:30 and left, and then went shopping at Old Navy, Petco, Staples, Office Max, and Linens 'N' Things.       Oh, I'm sorry. Did i say shop? I really meant to say...window shop. Windowshopping is so incredibly boring. Nothing like being so broke you can't buy anything. Ah well.       Oh, And i made the mistake of telling my "friends" who I like. They told him, and he pried it out of me, and he doesn't like me in return.      This day SUCKS.      With love,     April
