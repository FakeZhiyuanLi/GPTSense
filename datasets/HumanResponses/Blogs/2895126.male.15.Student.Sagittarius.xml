      We did not end up going roller skating today, as Graham had to go to Leigh's (his sister) basketball banquet. But we had fun when he got back anyway.  Tonight I went to the Carroll's house to play some games (on the condition that I bring some fudge of course). We first played Boggle, at which I admit I sucked pretty badly. I got better as the game went on.  We then played Mastermind, a game where two teams (in this case, consisting of Graham and me versus Linda and Nolan (Graham's mom and brother)) compete to reach the end of a pattern of squares by answering logic questions.  Thus, I have a question for y'all. I got this right and want to see who can get it right, first. Leave it as a comment.   Dave and Brad, two popular politicians, met at a club to discuss the overthrow of their party leader. They each ordered a vodka on the rocks. Brad downed his and ordered another. He then drank his second in a gulp and decided to wait before he ordered a third. Meanwhile, Dave, who was sipping his drink, suddenly fell forward dead. Both men were setup for an assassination. Why did Dave die and Brad live?    Have fun!   Pay no attention to what the critics say... Remember, a statue has never been set up in honor of a critic!  (Jean Sibelius)

      Broke my fast today!  I attended a Presbyterian communion service (done it before, not very exotic) and then we had some very good chowder for lunch, which resembled chili somewhat. Thank you, Linda Carroll.  I then had pizza for dinner, preceded and followed by general fun, including hammer-toss, a game in which Graham and I stand across the yard from each other and throw a hammer as close to each other as we can without killing the other person. Good times.  We then decided to make fudge with my mom, a certified executive pastry chef. After scrounging the chief ingredient, unsweetened chocolate, from Linda, we helped my mom make it. She messed up in a rather crucial phase and it turned grainy. She was extremely aggravated and we decided to buy another package of chocolate and whole milk. (This was at 9:45.)  When we got done, we made another batch and it got ruined. Well, we're trying again tomorrow as she believes she's isolated the problem. Then we're going roller skating. Tell you how it goes. (Something usually happens worth talking about.)   We are bits of stellar matter that got cold by accident, bits of a star gone wrong.  (Sir Arthur Eddington)

      Here's another test I found from beliefnet.com. (That was where the "Belief-O-Matic™" test came from.)   urlLink Kind of Catholic Are You?    I scored 82, on a scale of 0 to 100, so I am a traditionalist Catholic.    You are a traditionalist Catholic  You wish the church would revive the time-honored customs and strong institutional discipline that prevailed before the Second Vatican Council. Your favorite hymn is probably "Immaculate Mary," your favorite pope is Pius X, and your idea of a great Catholic movie is "The Bells of St. Mary's."

      There's a new comment script I put in that hopefully won't mess up the page like the old one did. Although all the old comments are *kaput,* I encourage you to please comment because it lets me know what you think of what I'm writing! I don't  usually   talk to myself.  Well, maybe every once in a while.  As of right now, the fast's doing well. I'm not hungry yet, but I'm sure I'll feel crappish around lunch, which, with me being the creature of habit that I am, has become the central gear in my day's revolution.

      Tomorrow I'm doing the 30-Hour-Famine, an occasion in which I raise money for starving children in Africa and don't eat for thirty hours. I get to have breakfast tomorrow, and I go until lunch on Saturday after some volunteering. It's actually lots of fun because I do it with my youth group.   Hope that I don't get too hungry... haha, I probably won't; I've done this two times before and it was fun.

      Today was Mix-Match Day at school... I thought I was done with that stuff when I got out of Assumption (where I attended elementary and middle school), but it seems that my educators still insist on embarrassing me in front of everyone else. I was very uncreative; I, being my normal rebellious self, wore normal clothes and two different shoes.  Shaun Lally, however (who has again requested a mention in the blog), wore his sister's shirt, constructed some Kleenex... uh, "breasts," and wore some other rather transvestite items. Well done, Shaun.  Quote of the Day  It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.  (Aristotle)

      This was an interesting day. I had a rather bitter feud with my mom concerning, of all God-forsaken things, Pokémon cards. Please don't assume anything here; I hate those things and am sincerely convinced that they're one of the worst things ever to happen to me as a child. Anyway, I had several "stars" (the "rare" ones) saved, some of them "holographic." My littlest brother, Ian, still fancies them a bit and "found" the stack. Now I had wanted to keep these until, in my old age or perhaps in a few generations (or maybe in another 1000 years) when they might actually be worth something. So my brother insists that they're his. Normally, you'd expect a parent to intervene in my favor, seeing that although I really don't like them and I haven't touched them in a while, they're still mine.   But mom didn't. So I went on a little thing about justice and about how it definitely wasn't just that she could give something of someone else's to someone without their consent. I am therefore censored as "RUDE" and silenced at pain of whatever parents can do to make your life miserable.   So that sucks. I'm considering writing "A Treatise on Parental Justice and Maintaining a Just Household," but I know she would just punish me and not read it. After all, I "think I'm always right." She is a hypocrite.  On a less condemning note, today there was a fire drill at work (for those of you who don't know where I work, I wash dishes at a retirement home/convent for scholastic nuns.). I had no idea where to go. I just ran upstairs to the entrance and luckily, that's where I was supposed to be. It was an interesting experience.  Quote of the Day  It is worse still to be ignorant of your ignorance.  (Saint Jerome)  Random (well not really) Shout Out of the Day (not a regular feature)  To Shaun Lally, my loyal reader and fan.   If you'd like a shout out, be like Shaun and just plain out ask me.

      Today in art class no one argued... Elliot went on a bit about the presidental candidates but it died quick. Two reasons why: 1) We have a new student in our class, Alejandro from Venezuela. 2) We were doing paper maché. So it ended up being rather boring. I'm working with Alex (a confusing situation here: we have an Alek (me), an Alex (my partner), and an Alejandro (our new student).) on the project and we ill-fatedly decided to do a cat. It's rather deformed, but I have been forbidden to speak about how bad it is (I  was  being rather dooming), so I have hopes for it. I'll let you all know how it turns out.

      Wow, it's really hypocritical, but I had fun at the tournament. My school won, we only really had four players, and I won my match. I played this one girl who was obviously a beginner, so I ended up feeling rather bad after crushing her. There was one point in the game where I had either the option to take her rook with my bishop or, simply, not. I pondered for about two minutes, and decided to do it. I remember what square it was too, F8. Hmm, ethics: you can win, but you have to feel bad about it.

      By the way, when I use the symbol "*," it denotes my performing an action... I got used to that on AIM, thank you Jenny. (Though to be technical she uses " .")   I'm posting this from Biology, wherein we are doing a "WebQuest." I'll talk about gym later, because I just realized I have about two minutes until the end of the period... Something interesting  did  happen.   EDIT:   Well, in gym, after performing a nice "tae bo" (description courtesy Bob Tunney) serve in volleyball and succeeding four times in getting it nice on the other side, the sophomores, who exclusively composed the other team, decided that this break in the natural order of things must be stopped and me, the transgressor, must be punished, especially because I am me and I am not supposed to do well in gym. So they spiked it and my short reign came to an end. Tragic.

      Hmm. Today I woke up a bit earlier than I would have liked in order to talk about something I don't really want to do. I hate that. There's a chess tournament today in Oakland (Pittsburgh, PA, for those not aware of where I am situated) and I really don't want to have to go, especially because of the almost constant uncertainty as to when I will be picked up. I think there should be a law: "Everything must be clear-cut and defined absolutely in the making of a plan involving more than three people."  Okay. One thing I don't get (at the risk of insulting several people who may be reading this, of course): those blogs that are almost totally random. What's the point? Who would want to read some disconnected rambling not related to anything remotely comprehensible? Actually, I might want to be a bit more lenient until my blog gets fixed up... I have some interesting links, format ideas, et cetera.  Wow, that was boring. Anyway, I'm soon off to school. Perchance, something interesting will happen.

            Believe it or not, this is a painting. A "notable" painting, hanging in the world-famous Tate Gallery in Britain.  I will never understand modern art. What is this supposed to mean? I could do this! It's trash!  Anyone could do this.   "Klein rejected the idea of representation or personal expression in painting, and became obsessed with immaterial values, beyond the visible or tactile. He began making monochrome paintings in 1947 as a way of attaining total freedom. A decade later, he developed his trademark, patented colour, International Klein Blue (IKB). He executed a series of paintings using IKB, as well as sculptures made from objects such as sponges dipped in the colour."    IT'S STILL JUST A CANVAS COLORED IN "SPECIAL" BLUE PAINT!     I am always doing that which I can not do, in order that I may learn how to do it.   (Pablo Picasso)

      This is what happened at work: a bit of an elevator malfunction.   This doesn't sound bad, but here's a blow by blow account:   1) I arrive at work, opened the door to  urlLink Marian Hall , and the fire alarm automatically goes off. (It's so horrible, the sound.) I assume it's a drill; that's happened before.   2)  I sit and find out that there actually was smoke. The alarm panel shows that there's a large amount of smoke above the stage, which is near the elevator.   3)  I find out that the elevator has stopped and that there's someone stuck in it. I say a few  urlLink Hail Marys  (being the religious kind of person I am) and sit and wait until about five  urlLink firetrucks  appear and take an hour to sort things out. I almost die of boredom.   4)  I find that the trapped person is poor Sister Rose, the 90-year-old or so nun who helps me out with dishes and always leaves me a snack. I feel horrible for her, with the smoke, firefighters, and being stuck in an elevator.   5)  I get to work, amidst firefighters and them airing out the elevator shaft. It takes an hour, and I finish at 8:00, an hour past the legal time for me to be there.  I had work today, and it was fine. Everything was back to normal, and Sister was frankly unshaken but told me how horrible it was.  Just thought I'd share.

      Okay, you knew it was inevitable: I've finally decided to post something about politics and religion (it's a great mixture of both!).   urlLink That Pledge of Allegiance Thing  --   " WASHINGTON (AP)  - A California atheist told the Supreme Court Wednesday that the words 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance are unconstitutional and offensive to people who don't believe there is a God.  Michael Newdow, who challenged the Pledge of Allegiance on behalf of his daughter, said the court has no choice but to keep it out of public schools..."   I'm sorry, but this seriously, seriously annoys me.  What if I, as a Christian, decided to sue because I thought  this  was offensive? I'd be laughed out of court. Well, actually I'm not sure. Rehnquist seems annoyed by this guy too. (Thus another of my phrases can be used:  Everything evil starts in California. )  Another thing that annoys me is that these people say that a government that allows the concept of God to be so horribly  forced  upon their children is a "theocracy." What about public worship places? Should we disguise them so that our atheist population (not so large, by the way) isn't "offended?"  What's so horrible about this? We are "one nation under God." Most of America  does  believe in God. Does the very  mention  of God force little atheists to convert? I don't think so.   I just hope the Supreme Court makes the right decision. Leave your opinion on this matter as a comment.   The average person thinks he isn't.   (Fr. Larry Lorenzoni)

      I had an interesting dream last night, involving the people on my bus.  I don't remember a lot of it, but I do remember that as we went down Forest Avenue JT, who, oddly, was not in the bus, was walking alongside the bus, also impossible as he was not running and the bus was going its normal speed.  Furthermore, he was defying physics by every once and a while stepping onto the bus and then stepping back onto the sidewalk. Bizarre.  I don't remember the events after this until I find myself at an odd shop located on a road near McKnight Road, near Sam's Club. It's that little shortcut road in the vicinity of St. Sebastian's and Starbucks and the postal depot. Anyway, it was somehow located along there and the bus stopped.  I'm not sure how I got into this, but the people in the store, who seemed to know our bus driver were bribing me to give names of people I knew. I remember giving the name of a person in my band, and they remarked that they could "get" him "at PNC Park."  I never understand my dreams. They seem to have no significance whatsoever except for to annoy me and cause me to wake up with a headache.   He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.  (Douglas Adams)

      Oh my God... I just thought about going to work and became very happy... I have no life!!! Aghhh!  Anyway, today was a day off, so I plan to actually get my homework done at home today. Schools should be required to give a day off every two weeks. We need to re-energize, and the weekends don't really help.  Dad's going to Las Vegas for a business trip. Maybe he'll get me something... (as Alek is enveloped by greed)  Last night Gordon successfully convinced me I don't have free will. I hate philosophers... No, actually, I'd like to learn more about it, but I'll wait until college. That kind of thing robs you of a certain innocence you can never get back. After you have insight into some things, it changes everything.

       Vita sugit.  Life sucks.  This Latin motto is dedicated to everyone whose week sucked, such as Melissa and Kate. My deepest sympathies; my week felt as though the crappid (yes, my own word) thing would NEVER END.   Today I had to do the St. Patrick's Day Parade.   Here are the  factors that caused it to be one of the worst experiences I have ever had in public.  1) New people in the band - sucky piping. 2) It was BELOW FREEZING. Not even the best of us can play worth crap when our hands are frozen stiff. 3) We were literally forced to wear green leis, making us all look very dorky. Kilts + leis = disaster. 4) I had to be at work for a special event at 2:00. We started moving at 12:15. I hate rushing. 5) I just hate parades.  Then I went to work, which I won't talk about because I'm too lazy.  I'd like to give my deepest sympathies to everyone who went to the game on Friday. We lost and you only got to watch the last few minutes because the fan bus was invaded by cheerleaders because their bus broke down. This was only the freshmen who had to get off, of course. People are very unfair. However, I'm indefinitely glad I wasn't able to go.   Quote of the Day  Life is just one damned thing after another. (Elbert Hubbard)

      About that blog entry from Friday... Please, people, don't be worried. I was in a really odd mood. Sorry to everyone who was concerned; you're all great friends. (Especially my Jiejie.)  Not too much happened today.  However, I did attend a lecture on the origins of Anglicanism at my grandparents' church, which was interesting. The speaker talked about the political, economical, and religious atmosphere that sets the stage for Henry VIII's scenario. I'll probably go back; it's a set of four speeches.  Yup. That's it...

      I'm in a much better mood today! (Apologies to my old second-best friend; I'm overreacting.)  Thanks to Jenna and Julie who helped me feel better.  I went to Honk! today, musical about the ugly duckling produced by my school. They all did a great job. That's about all that happened today although I did watch a good movie with Kevin Bacon, called " urlLink Stir of Echoes ," a good creepy movie with a nice, round-about ending.  That's about all, so I'll post a nice quiz for you all.  Please leave comments.  It makes this all feel worthwhile.   Which Biblical Hero Are You?   I'm  JOSEPH .

      It's been a while.   Today J.T. got beat up all over the bus... haha. We ended up fighting over a pop bottle and he was generally abused. Ah, J.T., so much fun...  Anyway, I saw   urlLink The Passion   on Wednesday and thought it was great. I don't think there could be a more accurate, moving, or cinematically superior rendition of the most important twelve hours in world history. I recommend seeing it unless you get sick easily or are too young to deal with the very brutal and bloody scourging at the pillar.  I also liked the language. :)  Two lines that I remember:   Ecce homo!  : Behold the man!  Quid est veritas?  : What is truth?  Both said by  urlLink Pontius Pilate , one of my favorite characters in the Passion narrative. He's a very interesting character due to his personality and struggle with condemning Jesus to death.   SYNOPSIS : Definitely worth seeing, be you Christian or not.

      Today was interesting.  I woke up early because Mallory who drives me had a detention. I then got to school, did nothing until History, whereupon I believe I failed a test about Buddha.  On a more positive and interesting note, on the bus home I found some of Lauren's old letters (written in Runar). We were geeks. Now just I am. :)  Anyway, we also convinced J.T. to make a cult. He says it'll have uniforms. I'm looking forward to it. ;)  Today's a beautiful day! I think I'll practice and then go to work (not optional, unfortunately).

          Movie Review  School of Rock     I very much liked  urlLink this movie . Believe it or not, I actually felt like listening to some rock after I was done, and that is  quite  a feat. Jack Black was hilarious, the kids were good, and I think it's overall one of the top five movies I've ever seen, counting the entire LoTR series as one, of course. I give it:  5 stars . If you haven't yet, see it yourself.  Next post I'll review " urlLink The Fifth Element ," a science fiction flick starring Bruce Willis.   Esse quam videri.

       Here's a cool quiz:   urlLink Which Edward II-Era Historical Figure Are You?          (1301-1330)  Half-brother to Edward II, Edmund the Earl of Kent was supportive and loyal to the king throughout both of their lives. Sadly, this family loyalty was not rewarded when Edward II was thrown off the throne by his wife, Isabella of France. Isabella's lover ordered the Earl of Kent beheaded, and he was.

        A Review of Pittsburgh Playhouse's     HARD TIMES   based on the novel by  Charles Dickens    I woke up with a headache and wouldn't mind if the backstage collapsed, killing every single actor, along with that ugly stage and every other wretched component of the worst play I've ever seen.  The first act confused me and induced me to fall asleep twenty separate, individually excruciating times. When it ended, I was sure the wretched thing would be done with, but no. There was still Act 2. It was also bad and I fell asleep for most of it.  The acting wasn't horrible; the play itself was. It just... sucked. There is no other word to describe the torturous two hours or so (I really have no idea) of my life that that wasted, excluding obscene words, which I do not use in print out of habit.

      Nobody responded to this. I'll give ya'll another chance.   Dave and Brad, two popular politicians, met at a club to discuss the overthrow of their party leader. They each ordered a vodka on the rocks. Brad downed his and ordered another. He then drank his second in a gulp and decided to wait before he ordered a third. Meanwhile, Dave, who was sipping his drink, suddenly fell forward dead. Both men were setup for an assassination. Why did Dave die and Brad live?    Leave your answer as a comment. Think about it.

      It was torture.  Bob Sendall, my mom's friend, got some bad directions and we ended up milling around the countryside in his SUV (ironic: he's a liberal, Bush-hating sort of person) for about an hour before stopping for directions at some golf range named "Bob's Links," or something, that was in the middle of nowhere. It took a guy at the bar five whole minutes to remember where the place was.  Now, I admit that the food was great: all the people invited were somehow affiliated with the food industry, and the main attraction, the lamb, is supposed to be the  urlLink best lamb  in the United States. So yeah, that was good.  Except I didn't know anyone there, and it was just really boring and not worth it. It could have been nicer, if we had come earlier.  -----  OK, my Math and Biology finals are whispering to me like the sirens calling Odysseus to his doom upon the rocks.

      Played " Highland Cathedral " (see below EMBED) for the Seniors' graduation mass today. Not too eventful.      We're going to some Memorial Day thing with a friend of my Mom's sometime soon; he has connections with someone who owns a farm (or, in this case, perhaps a château) and is going to be cooking an entire lamb. Cool. And because this friend of my Mom's is rather "upper class" this could turn out to be very ritzy.  I'll fill ya'll in.

      Today was one of the better, more memorable days of my life.  Reasons:  1) We had a class retreat today, for which I played the bagpipes. I thought I did well, although my stage fright is so bad I couldn't feel my fingers. The rest of me felt great. (Haha.)  2) During this retreat, which was supposed to be a spiritual reflection day, Paul Youchak got up and gave this little speech about a metaphor he had thought up. He claimed that when someone rips a single star off the flag and burns it, it's no big deal, but when they burn it, it's this horrible thing. Then he related that to how unimportant a single prayer is to the entire Church. Now, I don't remember how he tied this in, but he also said that we should only go after bad people and ignore good people; they don't need praise because they already know that they're good.  So I waited a while, and got up and argued. I said that burning one star is as bad as burning all the stars. One star, representative of one state, being burnt would make us no longer the United States. Then I related that to the Church: one prayer can make a lot of difference and is an important part of the Church, not to be underestimated.  So then he comes up and we start to argue on stage, and so Sara Mineo and Mike Hauser do too. Good times.  3) I went to Eat 'N Park with Emily, Kate, and Corey. My mom practically pushed me out of the car because we were blocking someone's way. So I'm just standing here without any money. She had just driven away. And given me her cell phone. I called dad, but I suppose before he had left or gotten too far, mom remembered and came back. It was an interesting experience.  4) Then we went to Northway Mall and saw Shrek 2. Before we actually went to see the movie, we hung around and got ice cream. Much fun.  5) Corey, unfortunately, got sick and had to go home before we saw the movie. But it was pretty good. We had opted for a later showing so that we could go around the mall a bit, and eventually that rather backfired. It was 11:30 and the mall was closed, so we had to go out through the back exit into the cold, whereupon I had the pleasant prospect of waiting for my mother for 20 minutes. Fortunately, Mrs. Wilfong let me and Emily stay in her car while we waited outside the (closed) Borders. When Emily's mom got there, we sort of traded off and Mrs. Wilfong left. It was only about 3 minutes before my mom got there. An "adventure."

      I cannot wait until this torture is over... Every teacher is trying to kill us! We have SO MUCH BIOLOGY it's ridiculous, I haven't understood Math since Mrs. Sibenac was replaced halfway through the year because she was PREGNANT, and English is crazy because we've barely gone over poetry and we already had our last class. History will be easy, Religion is boring and easy, Spanish is  también muy fácil , and Art has no final. Plus I have Gym tomorrow.  BUT besides all that, I've had a pretty good day. We were doing mythology in History and that's fun (plus I know all of it), and I have something to look forward to tomorrow: getting back my essay grade for English.  I get to see "The Prisoner of Azkaban" on the 4th at Loews'. At least that'll be fun. I'm going with Mallory Fuchs. Plus JR Stragar will be there. Haha, OATS. (

        And now for your edification, a quiz. You may respond by answering it yourself, or picking out something you liked/hated/thought was funny/now want to kill me for.     1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4 & type it here:   -guage because the advent of writing has perserved Latin for our    2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?  A book:  The Creator and the Cosmos  by Hugh Ross, Ph.D   3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?  Umm... I haven't done that in about a week.   4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is?  7:10 PM.   5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?   7:13 PM; not bad.   6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?    Yesterday  by the Beatles. (The present "Song or Tune of the Week!")   7: When did you last step outside? What were you doing?  I was walking out of Mt. Assisi after having completed work and getting ready to walk home, about a half hour ago.   8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at?   Nothing at all.   9: What are you wearing?  Clothes...   10: Did you dream last night?  If I did, I certainly don't remember.   11: When did you last laugh?  Maybe at school.    12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?   WOW, like everything. In my room I have: 4 maps, a chinese lantern, a calendar, miscellaneous pieces of paper including poems, lyrics to a Scottish song, prayer cards, birthday cards, a class picture, the pages of my Word of the Day calendar on my doors (since January 1, so exactly 146 of them), and a picture of Sister Camille's car with hot dogs, condiments, and whipped cream on it (a senior prank from last year). Also on my wall is a portrait of Christ and a tapestry from the Middle East.   13: Seen anything weird lately?  I found a ripped up note on the sidewalk entitled "Dear Nick." The rest of the pieces I found are unfortunately too random; I can't make anything out.   14: What do you think of this quiz?  I hope people don't get bored.   15: What is the last film you saw?  "In America," about an Irish family that immigrates to America and their transition here; sounds boring, but it was very good.   16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?  I would buy either some more cool stuff for my room or a USB port for my computer. Or a country. And I'd give some to Vincentian so they could a) fix the bells and b) get air conditioning and c) enlarge art facilities.   17: Tell me something about you that I don't know:  Well, as Adrian Henry put it, you're just a quiz. But, if, as I suppose you mean, I should tell  everyone  something about me they don't know, I guess I will. Uh... I really like Scotch tape.   18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?  Wars would stop and everyone would be smarter and more open-minded, and with more common sense. People wouldn't make fun of people (earnestly) for stupid things and one wouldn't need to take classes about things they'll never need to know about, such as biology. And more people would play the bagpipes.   19: Do you like to dance?  Nope. Not even when I'm alone.   20: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?  No idea whatsoever; I'll let my wife decide.   21: Imagine your second child is a boy, what do you call him?  Theodosius and Demetrius are both famous saints, and go nicely with "Schrenk."   22: Would you ever consider living abroad?  Yeah; I'd like to live in Scotland or anywhere in Western Europe.

      Et tu, Corey?  Yes, those of you familiar with the life of Julius Caesar will have already realized that Corey, stable, loyal Corey, has betrayed me. And several old nuns to boot.  He just absolutely ditched me today at work. He promised dear, sweet Sister Rose that he would let me know (because he volunteered me for work, you see) and never told me.  So I was interrupted during dinner and had to work late.  Sister Rose said it herself, "That was a very mean thing of him to do!"

      I'm teaching recreation at a Vacation Bible School this week.  I have to try (and ultimately fail, even with the help of Graham, Nolan, and Emily) to control 30, screaming, running, annoying, 3 to 6 year olds.  It's not torture for the entire two hours i do it, because they're only one group, but GOOD LORD, are they the WORST.  One kid, while attempting to jump a 3-foot tall iron fence (with dull spikes every three inches) got snagged and ended up with his head on the ground and his legs in the air and a hole in his pants. All the more fun with the passers-by who had to help him up.   This kind of thing happened the entire 15-minute torture session we were subjected to. Luckily, they're calling in two more helpers, augmenting our force to a strong six during recess.  And so we brace ourselves for battle.

      Right now I'm too lazy and ill to post...  I hate being sick more than almost anything. It's just intense, unescapable misery.  But on the plus side, I'm refurbishing the blog  a bit  a lot. I'm going to make it very nice. :)

         An Ode to Cream Cheese     or     An Entreaty in Favor of Actuality     by Alek Schrenk    Today I was eating a bagel: Pure baked goodness that doesn't finagle. But what could complete this whole-wheat treat? Only the cream cheese which I love to eat.  But first a tale of how I came to my conclusion  And cast away the pretenders that heightened my delusion. Unwittingly, we were in possession Of a sick pseud, an item of little expression. Low fat cream cheese! It wouldn't spread! The globby tastelessness filled me with dread!  But finally through hardship I persevered And trashed was the imposter, once the truth appeared! Good, fatty, and wholesome are some words that describe The Philadelphia product that fixed my vibe. Put on a bagel, it enhanced it with style; That other junk was never so versatile.  As so this ode shall come to an end. A warning it gives, to those whose wares pretend! Down with the fakeness! Down with the fraud! And up with the real stuff that isn't as flawed!

      I've always thought that the "plot" of the Beatles' "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" would make a great movie.   Psycho medical student with a trademark silver hammer which he uses to kill his girlfriend, his teacher, and the judge at his trial... You could have a sequel and everything... It'd be great.

      Finally I can post!  I was busy with finals. Blah.    BUT SCHOOL IS FINALLY OVER!    Okay, here's my little rundown:  --   English : Easy; churned out the usual crap for the essay  Biology : WAY TOO EASY: the way the other tests were and how she tried to prepare us, it was almost unfair   History : Easy. World History? I laugh at World History.  Spanish : Easy; she was very kind and barely covered anything.   Religion : Same stuff from 4th grade stirred up all over again.  Math : My weakness: I don't think I failed, but the forecast is not sunny, ladies and gentlemen.  --  Today I saw  Harry Potter 3 .  It was really good, the cinematography and effects and all. And the actors were great. The set was, as usual, TERRIFIC. I watch the movie just for the set sometimes. Additional bonus: it wasn't as childish and maintained interest.  The only problem (and a major one, sort of) is that they shaved down and mixed up the story so much, a lot is assumed and it's out of whack. My opinion is that the actual  movie  part of it makes up for that. So, I give it  4 1/2 STARS  and a recommendation to go.

      Okay. I was gone all last week at Duquesne University, for a stay-in-the-dorms summer campish thing my school does for freshman and sophomore years, designed to&nbsp;make you hate Duquesne.&nbsp;(We got over the crappy dorms; it was great.) A typical day:  &nbsp;   7:30 AM - 8:40 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wake up and Breakfast at Duq. Union Cafeteria   8:40 AM - 8:55 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning Assembly; Prayer and Announcements   9:00 AM - 10:20 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class 1   10:25 AM - 11:45 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class 2   11:45 AM - 12:45 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lunch at Duq. Union Cafeteria   12:45 PM - 2:05 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class 3   2:10 PM - 3:30 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class 4   3:35 PM - 5:00&nbsp;PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elective:" Art, Drama, or Team Building   5:00 PM - 6:00 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dinner at Duq. Union Cafeteria   6:00 PM - 7:00 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free time   7:00 PM - 9:00 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activity: sports, etc.   9:00 PM - 11:00 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dorms  &nbsp;   (11:00 PM - about 3:00 AM) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fool around  &nbsp;  That last item was added my me, of course.  &nbsp;  Anyway, as you can imagine, a week like this is going to either make you hate everyone or make you wish it'd never end. I thought our class did very well in this respect. While I've heard little horror stories about how everyone hates each other by the end of sophomore summer session from this year's juniors, we got along all right.  &nbsp;  Way to go. (Eww... I was positive.)  &nbsp;  I'll just pick out some events that were memorable, in no particular order.  &nbsp;    "Open Discussion" in Brian's and Giuseppe's room... no comment as to what we (Stand, Stack, Staltari, Muchow, Hauser, etc.) talked about.  I like soup.  Mr. Bockstoce's birthday "surprise..." climaxing in an entire cake shoved into Rich Latusca's face and all over the wall.  Wildwood Highlands go-carts.  How only Hauser is worse than me at goofy golf.  Walking from Duquesne to the Point and back in Walking... and then two days later, 3 miles in 55 minutes.  Good Ol' Options cafeteria (vomits).  Me and my bagpipes :) .  For a definitive guide, contact Helena Erdeljac, who has a complete journal of her experiences. I wasn't this... uh, conscientious, but she certainly was.   Well, that's really all I feel like Blogging right now, except for a statement I'd like to make about how certain things depress me.  I have a little nostalgia problem. Whenever something fun or really memorable happens, I get all sad about it. Like this week, I knew that our class would never be that close again. And when I think back to the class of '04's senior movie thing, even though I wasn't in that class, it made me sad. All these great things, and they all fade away!   I guess I just have a fear of change. I just need to accept that things move on and then just go. *Sigh.*  But on a happier note, I'm free this week and then I get to go the beach! I'll blog about that too.

      Sorry I haven't posted in a while. I was attending a summer bagpipe camp (an annual event for me) and that ate up my week pretty well. I had fun  and  got to wear a kilt four out of eight days. We had great teachers too, such as bagpiping notables (they're actually  urlLink listed  as such) as Angus J. MacLellan and Mark Wygent, along with excellent teachers and performers Lyric Todkill (that is such a great name) and Patrick Regan, my teacher.  Some time soon, I can post some .mp3s of me playing, just because I'm that cool.   Cool Link for Today :   urlLink http://alphabetizer.com/   Worth adding to your Favorites.

      I had a mediocre time at the beach; no comment. Just nothing to talk about. Still fun and all. Yeah.  Anyway, I got a link to this cool website where you can make maps of the places you've been in the world. I wish I traveled more. See how pathetic this is:  (Click the link; posting the actual picture messed things up very badly.)   urlLink Click clickity click clack cluck cloock    urlLink Create your own personalized map of the USA   or  urlLink write about it on the open travel guide
