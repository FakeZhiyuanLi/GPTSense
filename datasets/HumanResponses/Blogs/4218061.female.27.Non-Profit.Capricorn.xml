      I have just read 2 books in about 4 days &amp; found both of them very enjoyable. I read Legal Tender by Lisa Scottoline and really liked it - I have researched what other books she has written so that I can read those next. I also just finished Tough Cookie by D. Mott Davidson. I felt a little silly with a book titled Tough Cookie, but it was a fun, enjoyable read. I also looked up what other books she has written to read those when I have time. Davidson has a reoccuring character, which is something I really like. I find that you really get to know them over the course of a book and then I hate to never read about them again. Scottoline has a reoccuring character, but not your traditional set-up. Her characters appear to come the same all-female law firm - so you see the same characters, but one book may focus on A and then the next book will focus on B, etc. Still - both very good books for quick, fun reads (for me). Keep in mind, I am reading for enjoyment - not learning. :)

      Hello! Welcome to my blog.  My friend Mike has one & I thought I needed one.  As for my blog name, if you don't know what a Muggle is, I ain't gonna tell you.  Trixie is a nickname my friend Maggie Ho gave me - based on the Outlaw Golf XBox game.  I am not "dumb as a ball washer" like Trixie is, but the game has bonded our friendship.  I am sure my friend Maggie would also me to point out that her last name isn't Ho nor is she a Ho - her middle initial is H and while trying to guess her middle name one night, my husband - Jim, otherwise known as Juan Carlos - and I both blurted out "HO!" at the top of our lungs at the same time, and henceforth, Maggie has been Maggie Ho. And while I am talking about Ho - while Maggie was driving to Wisconsin to visit us from Minneasota, she passed a very interesting billboard somewhere along highway 29.  The sign was for what appeared to be a local bar/pub that served food.  It was blue and proclaimed "Ho-made pizza."  She can't remember what city it was because driving 29 across WI is boring as heiney, but we would really like to know what "homade" means.  Is their grammer so bad and they were going for "homemade" and missed?  Or are the pizzas made by hos (hoes) ?  If you can, please help us solve this mystery.  I guess that its for now.  Welcome to my Blog!
