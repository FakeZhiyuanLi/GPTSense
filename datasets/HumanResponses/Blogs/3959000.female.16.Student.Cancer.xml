       Well i really miss eric...&nbsp; It's been like a week and a half... two weeks since i've last seen or heard from him.&nbsp; I'm sure that he's doing fine... but i just really miss him...&nbsp; Curt was here this weekend... so naturally he and humaira (his girlfriend) were on the phone constantly.&nbsp; And when they werent curt was talking about how much he missed her... and yea they've been going on for a LOT longer... and she lives&nbsp;in NYC... and&nbsp;they're older and what not... but i mean still... he gets to talk to her at least... all the time on top of that... I just wish that there was something that i could do to be able to talk to eric at least... i would be fine with not getting to see him... i just miss talking to him... u know... being part of his life... its really starting to get to me... and it really sucks... Today when i was at the mall i saw Jason Harsy and we were talking about eric becuz jason works with him.&nbsp; And i told him the whole situation and he told me to keep holding on and all that good stuff... and i plan on it... its just so hard.&nbsp; I mean its worth it becuz i love him... and he means the world to me... but its just so hard..&nbsp; I have this picture of us sitting right next to my computer and im always looking at it and i just want to start crying... becuz i miss him so much and there isnt anything that i can do about it.&nbsp; Mom and i were talking about it today on the way home today... and i was talking about eric and his parents and the whole situation... and we were trying to better understand it... and u know see if maybe we both talked about it we could figure something out... but we still couldnt come up with anything.. I just dont understand how someone's parents would want to take something away from their kids if it made them happy... i mean if it's something bad then yea, thas understandable... drugs... alcohol... all the bad no-no's... i can understand that.&nbsp; But im a good kid... i dont do any of that... its just not fair... I dunno... it's just been tougher than normal lately.&nbsp; It's like the only music i really listen to is anything that he sent me... Ugh... i just cant wait for school to start... so i can see him again... I really didnt think this was going to be this hard... but it is... I always find myself driving like 10 miles out of the way to get home just to drive by his house... even tho i know that i cant stop and go in and say hi... just so... i dunno... maybe i'll see him standing outside and i dunno... something... I guess even if i just get to see him as im passing by... ill take that... It's like i try to go into town at a time that he might be getting off work, or going into work... or something... its so sad just how much i miss him... it's pretty pathetic actually... but i dunno... its like all that ive been thinking about lately... Oh well... its not like there is anything that i can do to change any of it... I just have to do what Jason told me to... just keep holding on and pray for the best... so thas what i plan on doing...

       Well... Kayt left the other day... so now im stuck here at home with a license... yes... but no best friend to cruise around with...&nbsp; It really sucks!&nbsp; She's only been gone a few days, but i already miss her a ton!&nbsp; So i've been hanging out with Jimmy and Tanner more lately.&nbsp; It's a good time, but they dont quite have the girl talk that kayt and i have.&nbsp; I'm definitely ready for it to be next Sunday so she'll be home.&nbsp; Today i went and set up my volunteering job.&nbsp; I get to go dance with old people tomorrow!&nbsp; I'm so excited lol.&nbsp; They're prolly going to think that im crazy and all that good stuff, but it should be good for me and them both.&nbsp; I hope that i can make some new friends... I'm sure that they all have some great stories to tell, they just need some people&nbsp;to talk to.&nbsp; The nursing home that im going to volunteer at is where my Grandma Marcuum lived before she died.&nbsp; Today when i was there a bunch of people remembered me from when i was a little kid and i used to go there and see grandma.&nbsp; It should be fun... &nbsp;

        So yea kayt, i think u had a good idea with starting one of these blogs.&nbsp; It's a way for all of us to get out our feelings without hurting other ppl... i guess.&nbsp; Well its my first post, and i just got done talking to eric.&nbsp; Neither of us can seem to let go... so i guess we're going to hold on for awhile still.&nbsp; I'm hoping that in time his parents will trust him and i more, so we can actually have a relationship and not have to "sneak around."&nbsp; He really means a lot to me and i cant stand the thought of losing him.&nbsp; It brings tears to my eyes just to think about it.&nbsp; Well on a different note, i am going to kayt's house tonite, so i can shower AND eat, lol.&nbsp; And hopefully tomorrow will go by really fast so then it'll be tuesday and i can get my license :D! Oh my... i cant wait, the car's just about ready for me to go and yea, i just cant wait!&nbsp; Well thas all for now..

       Well... i think that i've definitely reached a fork in the road...  I broke things off with eric... but i think that it was mutual... kayt told me that he said he was going to break things off anyway... because he didnt want a serious relationship in high school... or something... i dont know... But the more that i try to move on... the more i dont want to let go.  It's not fair... i wanted eric... i wanted things to work with him... i loved him... love him actually... and its just not fair...  I dont understand how i always end up the one that gets hurt... i wasnt supposed to be the one that got hurt out of all of this... thas not how it was supposed to go.  I mean i obviously didnt want to hurt him... but i wasnt supposed to be the one that got hurt out of all of this.  I love how all guys tell you that they wont hurt you... that they arent like the rest... but i still always end up being the one that is hurt and crying in the end.  I just dont understand... he told me that he still loves me... that he always will... and like even when we're talking or something, he'll tell me that he loves me and cares about me... but then y didnt he fight... what made it not worth fighting for anymore... i guess that i need to keep telling myself that this was still a lot of his parent's decisions... but ugh... i just dont know... i just... i wanted it to work... we were so great together... i mean it all just came out of no where... but it was all so great...   Now i've been hanging out with andy... and andy is awesome, but i mean i think that i really need to just tell him that we need to slow down and just hang out and stuff for awhile, cuz i still have to get over all of this.  It seems like thas all i ever do... go out with someone and then get over them... im always in one of those two phases, there really isnt any other phase... and i kinda wish there was... but i guess im just not capable of staying single... or something... i dunno.  Or maybe i am capable of staying single, but anytime that im single, im getting over someone... i dunno, thas a lot to think about... and i dont really have the strength right now.  The only thing that i know for certain right now is that i miss eric... i didnt want things to end with him.  But yet i have to move on... i am certain of that too... i just know that the beginning of school is going to be horrible... I'll just have to stay strong... i mean if i could deal with going to school and bein in the same classes as J the day after we broke up... i think that i can deal with seeing eric... Last nite kayt and i were outside watching the meteor shower and we were just sitting there talking.  And i brought up eric and i said something about how i wondered if he was going to go bac to being just "that kid" and she said that she hoped he didnt... and then i said that i hoped he did... and then the tears just started streaming down my face... And all of the questions... what have i done? did i do this for the right reasons? can i fix it? should i fix it? how would i fix it?... i dont feel like i can talk to anyone about any of this... i mean i love kaytlin dearly, but i always just feel so bad/weird talking to her about my guy problems... becuz i know how fed up she gets with me... and she is on the outside, and she sees the logical side of all of it... but i cant see the logical side of any of it... all i see is emotion... my head doesnt make decisions for me anymore, just my heart does, its in full control of my body... I dont know what to do anymore... i dont know what to think or to feel... im in a huge mess... i dont know how to get myself out... where to even begin... i know that i either will have to hurt more people, or myself... or both... thas how it always goes... which way to turn... i do not know...

       Today was GREAT! But i think i'll start at last nite.  I've had insomnia the last week or so right, well yesterday kaytlin got home, so i stayed the nite at her house.  So instead of just thoughts going through my head i could actually say them; it was great.  And through all of our (and by our i mean my... lol i didnt really shut up much and i think she wanted to sleep) talking im starting to completely change my way of thinking about all of this.  Like at first i didnt really see how his parents could change their minds about the whole situation... and let us start seeing each other, but now that i think about it more rationally and try to look at it from a parents' point of view i dont see how they can not eventually let up a little, even if its just a little bit at a time, i think they will eventually start giving him more trust.  I mean cuz i was thinking about it, and yea... if i were them i could see them having grounded him for the rest of the summer... becuz yea we totally broke their trust and lied to them, that is most definitely rooms for serious grounding... But... once school starts they'll have to start giving him more freedom.  And i mean they are doing all of this becuz they dont want him to fall in love at a young age, and i think they're trying to do all of this to show him that he's not really in love... like this is all so bad that obviously its not worth holding on.  But if we do hold on... and stay together... maybe they'll see that im someone that he actually cares about... and maybe they'll give me a chance to show that im not that bad of a person.  I dunno... i guess im just happy that im finally starting to look at all of this in a positive light instead of my wonderful gloomy outlook on all of it.  And i mean yea i miss him and i wish i could see him and talk to him more... like a normal relationship, but hey i love him, i can wait for all of that.  I mean what is so great about a relationship if u dont have to fight a little bit for it.  Im definitely convinced that if we make it through all of this, then we will be able to make it through anything...

       Well.. i got to talk to eric this morning... for a lil bit... I think things are starting to change... slowly... but i think they are... I was reading thru our old convos and yea... i can definitely tell things are different now.  I mean i know that is to be expected... but im scared that we're growing apart.  It seems like he's holding on because he doesnt want to think about letting go.  And because if he let go that would mean that his parents were right... It doesnt seem like he loves me as much anymore... now they're just words... and i dont know if those feelings are still behind them backing them up... I dunno, im sure that im just freaking out... because im me... and thas what i do... and because this is all just so hard.  But i mean i think about stuff like that and then i wonder what im holding on for... i mean i love him... i know that much... but am i holding onto something that is dying anyway... no matter how much neither of us want it to... I'm so scared that by the time school comes around he's going to be done with me... done with all of this... and then i will have held on for nothing... Well not nothing... this is my challenge from God... i have to keep reminding myself of that... God wants to test me... wants to give me a challenge... and this is it.  I'm trying my best, and im hoping and praying that it is somewhere close to good enough.  I mean i know that it isnt good enough... but it might be somewhere close...  I love eric so much... i dont want to lose him... or what we have... had... i dunno if that should be present or past tense... i dont know if we've lost it already or not...  I'm going to keep holding on... it's all i can do... Just walk forward blindly... hoping that im not going to stumble and fall... and if i do... i hope that someone will be there to pick me up and point me in the right direction... Wow... this really doesnt sound like something that a loving girlfriend would be writing... but i dunno... it's what has been on my mind... what ive been thinking about... the source of my insomnia for sure... and probably my illness as well... Its funny what love will do to the most capable of people...
