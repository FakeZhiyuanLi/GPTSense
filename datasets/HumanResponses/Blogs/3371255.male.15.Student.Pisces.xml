      I'm White...and I've been the victim of rascism...hmmm There are these black kids at my school...yeah, they think they are better than all white people...rascist, hypocritical dipshits... This is sad. I know I never owned a slave...and I'm pretty sure that they were never slaves(if they were...they're pretty old for Freshmen...), so their argument MUST be based on  anscestrial heritage... Let ALL know, even before the civil war, only 10% of the white people owned slaves...and none after the war. My family imigrated durring the 50's...and by their suposed logic, this statement must make perfect sence. I am part Jewish. I am also part German. Does this mean that my anscestors were Nazis, and treated my anscestors horribly, and  as such I should hate myself for my anscestors treatment of...themselves? No, this makes no sence, and I find that these...honestly I can't think of a word to call them... are just trying to get an advantage rom their fore-father's strife. And as we all know, the Africans wouldn't even think about selling their brethren into slavery... the Europeans just swept over and conquored the place... I hate people sometimes ... they can be stupid, and naustalgic. And another thing, why is it considered rascist for me to say the "N" word, but they can call me a "Cracker" all they want? GOD!!! It just doesn't make ANY SENCE!!! You know, there was a guy who was walking in the Bronx at night with his friend, when two black guys woth knives started walking towards him. His buddy, the smart one, ran. He, however, felt it would be rascist if he ran. His body was found in a dumpster, behind a bar. Funny...

      I find it Ironic that our society is willing to accept blame for the ills of the world...and from those who poison it! If you have ever been on the west coast of the US, you will find that many of the people actually SIDE WITH THE TERRORISTS! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING?????? If I came up to someone, and punched them in the face, would they blame themselves? NO! They would punch me right back! You know there are SERIOUS problems with a society when they feel that they are to blame for EVERY LITTLE THING! 2 1/2 years ago, we had a 2 planes fly into the World Trade Center...killing 3000+ people, and now, all we can think about is a few "Tortured" Iraqi soldiers? As I recall, those who died in the Trade Center were not exactly beligerant...they were TRADING. but let's not even mention the men and women in the towers, crying out in vain as fire consumes them, or those who jumped out from 80+ stories onto the pavement to escape such a fate... let's talk about 3 ENEMY SOLDIERS who were "discrased"...and ofcourse they were never planning to bomb our military bases in Iraq, never ever ever ever trying to KILL our troops...My thinking is, if you are going to attempt to attack those who are liberating you, then you had better be ready to face the consequences. Let my rant be a lesson to society... for many of the ills in the world, we are not to blame. We are the ones who prevent the ills of the world...or at the least TRY to.           *cough*France,Germany*cough* Grrr...

      And so it has begun...I shall soon enough begin to post my problems with society(and there are MANY), and I believe that we shall find we have a jolly good time reading this...and laughing at the idiosincrocies of the world. I bid you all a good night...though I will indeed post again tonight...in about 2 min.
