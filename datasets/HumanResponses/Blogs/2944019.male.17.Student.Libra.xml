      Well, I feel so happy today eventhough there are so two unlucky things that happened to me... First is when I got a low grade in my quiz in Psycho. I actually got 3 correct items out of twenty! Second is I also got a low grade in my another quiz which is 16 correct items out of 42. I'm not that um disappointed. I even laughed hard! I don't know why did it happened to me. So ironic...  Uh oh... Filipino, Sociology and CoArc... I wonder if the professors are gonna get mad at us because of that damn strike that happened last Monday, my classmates decided not to go to those classes! Imagine, all of my classmates decided to cut class (I'm also included)... Eh karamihan naman dun mga matatalino! Grabe, ang galing talaga na mag-impluwensya ng mga classmates ko nung first sem! Hay naku, bahala na...  Langya naman tong friendster, walang mga picture na lumalabas... $#!+

      ANG INIIIIIIIT!  Feeling ko nasa loob ako ng oven! Grabe, as if na bahay pa lang ako, ginagawa na akong human lechon... Iitim ako nang di oras nito.  Waah... Wala akong maintindihan sa CoArc! Pakiramdam ko kanina lumulutang ang mga question marks sa ibabaw ng ulo ko, parang anime! Mas mahirap pa pala yun kesa sa Prog! Langyang buhay naman. Eto din ang Trigo, pahirapan din! Maganda na nga ang performance ko dun nung midterm kasi at least tumaas ang grade ko. Fron 4.00 nong prelim naging 2.75 last midterms. Gusto ko yung i-improve! Balak ko pa naman na kumuha ng scholarship next sem. Ayoko nang bumalik sa Tan-Yan-Kee Shoclarship! Pahirapan ang quota nila! Di kaya ng powers ko!  Aaah shit! sakit ng ulo ko! Parang na-sunburned an anit ko!

      Hay naku, kakapagod ang gumawa ng payroll! Kailangan ko pang mag-overnight para matapos... Speaking of overnight, last Saturday, pumunta ako sa bahya ni Mark sa Marikina... Asar talaga ako noong mga 23.30 kasi sabi nya sa text, si Argel, na nakakaalam ng daan sa kanila, wala sa jolibee. Kaya ako, naghintay hanggang 2 na ng hapon. Then sabi sa kin ni Mark, susunod si Richelle. After a while, dumating na sya. On our way to Marikina, panay ang text ko sa kanya. Ang nakakatawa pa nun, panay din ang akyat-baba sa mga sasakyan. Halos maubos na ang pera namin dun! Nang dumating kami sa Marikina, sabi sa akin ni Mark umiwi na raw si Argel! Asar talaga!Langya yun, nilagnat! Yan tuloy,ako lang ang nagi-iisang gising! Daya nya! Parang sira nga rin yun. Kasi naman, around 2:00 in the morning nagising sya tapos sabi nya siya raw muna ang gagawa kaya ako natulog then mga around 3, nagpalit naman kami. Naglaro sa playstation tapos after a while sabi nya bumalik ang lagnat nya. Hayun, natulog hanggang sa tuluyang sumikat ang araw! Ako natulog ako ng 6:00 ng umaga. Then nagising ako siguro mga nine na yun. Nakita ko yun, naglalaro sa playstation tapos natulog! Kaya ang ginawa ko na lang, mga around ten umuwi na lang ako! Yun ang first overnight stay sa bahay ng isang classmate!

      Hay naku, eto ako, gumagawa ng blog, gumagawa ng testimonial para kay Shayne, at nagbabasa ng email galing kay ate. dami noh? Well, di pa dyan natatapos ang mga gagawin ko. Mag-aaral pa ako para sa quiz ko sa Socio, gagawa ng assignment sa Filipino, at titignan ko pa kung ano ang aking gagawin sa project namin ng classmates ko sa Prog, yung payroll system na kung saan kinailangan ko pang mag-overnight sa bahay ng classmate ko sa Marikina.  Ano kaya ang masasabi ko kay Shayne? Hay naku, hayaan mo na. Langyang babaeng yun, daming kabulastugang ginagawa sa buhay. Mahilig pang idamay ang UE-CCSS kesyo daw may field trip daw para makakuha ng pera kay tita para ma-tubos ang kanyang phone. Gaga talaga yun! mahilig magpa-alipin kay Ron, ang kanyang "malambing" at "sweet" na boyfriend! Kaya nga botong-boto nga ako na mag-hiwalay silang dalawa. Siguro pati sina Ging ganun din ang boto tulad sa'kin.  Saka na muna yun... Magbabasa muna ako ng mga email ko. Binabasa ko ngayon yung galing kay ate. Mukhang maganda yung pinadala nya sa aking personality test... Gotta go!

      It's been almost a week since I last post here. I got mumps that's why I did not have the chance to go out and post. Here's what happened during my five days of incubation... I did not attend school for five days. I really missed a lot of topics! I got sick of eating soft foods... I really looked fat... Everyone in the house teased me... I missed singing my heart out... I got tired of papa's sermons aout the damn scholarship... My seelping patters have changed... I only sleep due to the effect of the medicines... And... I got tired of watching TV!

Well, it's all about Madame Auring and her 20-year old boyfriend, I mean fiancee, having sex... Showing the viewers um, different positions on how to make love... I'ts a very good porn vcd... Madame Auring can be a very good porn star!   JOKE!   What if Madame Auring and her fiancee did that? It's very disgusting! Kung maghalikan nga sila yung simpleng kiss lang kadiri na! What if kung nag-sex pa sila?! Hay naku, siguro ginayuma yung lalaki para may makatabi siya sa pagtulog at kapag nalilibugan ay may gagalaw sa kanya, hindi yung mage-emote na lang siya na parang kinakangkang!  What if kung kumalat yun sa internet?  What if kung kumalat din yun sa mga bangketa? May bibili kaya? kung may bibili, malilibugan kaya sila o matatawa?   Kinikinalbutan na 'ko! Tama na!

      grabe, ang saya ng debut ni ging. hindi sa program mismo, but i'll consider that, dahil sa mga nangyari sa akin during that day...  actually, late na kaming dumating sa venue. eh kasi naman no, sina me-an at tisa nag-ayos pa ng sarili sa bahay ni me-an tapos etong pa-importanteng si ara nagpasundo pa sa kanila gamit ang taxi kaya dagdag din sa pamasahe. eto pa ang mas matindi, nakalumitan ko pa ang gift o\ko for the debutante! pagdating namin, siguro tatlo pa ang magsasayaw tapos turn ko na. nakakahiya pa dahil ka-kulay pa namin ni me-an yung tablecloth, pula! ayoko pa ng food dun dahil biglang nangasim ang sikmura ko. mukha kasing half-cooked yung mga pagkain e. pero nakabawi din dahil sa disco... nag-showdown pa kami ni molina! then ang kulit pa ng emcee (di sina sir blando at mam mantua dahil resonable ang mga excuse nila sabi ni ging), sinayaw yung sayaw ng rejoice! kthen after the party, kulitan to the max sa elevator. nahilo pa nga si molina, kaya ang banat ko sa kanya ay "sir, wala kasing ganyan sa tribo nyo!" di pa dun natatapos yun. sa kotse ni mike, walo kaming andun! di pa kasama yung driver. let me enumerate... ako, naseef, sir molina, mark, tisa, ara, me-an and mike. buti na lang may kalakihan yung car! actually, kaming lahat nagkukulitan lalo na ng nagkayayaan na pumunta ng punchline na katabi lang ng aberdeen. tapos si sir molina pa yung magbabayad, ang saya nun! grabe, marami talagang banatan, ang saya talaga! it's one of the most memorable days of my life!

      heto ako, nakaupo sa tapat ng computer... naghihintay ng himala...  speaking of himala, kagabi, talagang may himala! e kasi naman paalis na si uncle boy for his job as a seaman. so last night, while he was packing up, he decided to go to mercury. kasama lang dun si cherisse e tinanong nya ako kung gusto kong sumama. and i decided na sumama sa kanila because i don't want to see my father's face! while we were in mercury, uncle boy asked us to put everything we want sa pushcart. as in everything! kaya lang, eto, nahihiya sobra. sa simula i thought he was joking. pero nakita ko si cherisse putting everything she wants. then tinanong ako ni uncle kung ano ang gusto ko. but i still hesitated. pero nung nakita na yung pimple ko sa cheek, na malapit nang matuyo at that moment na eventually nawala nang tuluyan ngayon, he looked for the astringent that i really use. when we found that astringent, cherisse jokefully told me to get three bottles but when i saw a bigger one, i said,"eto na lang kaya?" then uncle boy put it in the pushcart. after that, cherisse saw the anti-pimple facial wash that i used and asked me if it's effective and i said that it's effective especially if you use the astringent afterwards. and she got two big bottles for both of us! when we came to the chocolate section, we stopped and decided to chat while uncle boy was in the pharmacy section, buying his medicines needed. then when he came, he asked us to get the chocolates we really wanted. i was undecided and che took a cadbury. i forgot what variant it is. then marched down to the cashier to pay everything. oh, before i forgot, my half-brother ramy texted me something while shopping. i don't know what it is coz che is holding my mobile phone. i wanted to get rid all of his messages because i still can't accept the fact that he's my brother! oh i really wanted to change my sim card everytime he texts me. the only thing i can do is not to reply and erase all of his messages, whether it's a message or a quote. as long as the message came from his mobile phone.  then this afternoon, i went to ue to ask the schedule of enrollment and the cost for the downpayment.  i was really ppetrified whe i found out that the enrollment started last may 12 and the good thing it will end on june 14. another good thing is shayne and rose are gonna be my classmates because they were supposed to be on the other section but unfortunately, the section they chose was closed. so we decided to go for the first section.  okay, i'll be leaving now kasi gusto ko pang humabol sa panonood ng soap opera sa bahay! till my next post... ciao!

      damn... school time is here again! stress is slowly coming back to life. research works, projects, assignments, heavy traffic, floods and f*****g profs. but i can see all my friends and nice profs, that's my consolation.  my first day of school is pretty fine... except for the first subject which is dsalg. walang professor na dumating. hayup! the others are nice like the one in prog 2.  what i hate about my p.e class is the location. it's on top of the building. my legs were shaking when i came there because i got tired of climbing the stairs.  to wrap up the day, it was normal!  today, i'm going to meet my two other professors. i hope the're nice like the ones yesterday.

      I thought that my humanities class yesterday is boring. There are some things inside my head that I just can't stop thinking about like old and  malditang  professors. But my hunch about it was wrong. He was a seminarian who just got out a few months ago from the seminary. My first impression about him is pretty cool. Maybe because he's young and he has lots of ideas for the class to learn and to apprecciate art, like going to the museums, listening to the classical music and watching movies with sense. He said that this was his first time to teach humanities since his major is philosophy and he'll be teaching for the very first time a coed class because he got used to teach younger boys inside the seminary.  Today, in my calculus class, the department changed the professor. I don't have the guts to ask them why. But the one who took place of the female professor (a male professor) seems to be nice because he had students before who eventually became my classmates.  Oh well, I do need to go home because I'm so hungry. Good thing that my class is over, not like my schedule yesterday. I had a  four and a half hour break (1:30pm - 6:00pm) and go home at 7:30pm. Ciao!

      GOD GAVE ME A BEAUTIFUL DAY!!!  Let me tell you why... 1.  The rust stain on my polo shirt. 2.  A boring class. 3.  Siahara didn't came to the meeting place to get her book that she wants to borrow. 4.  I forgot my pe uniform and when pe came, I found out that we don't need to wear it first and the admin changed the uniform. 5.  The weather is playing tricks on me.  Umuulan pag lumalabas ako. 6.  Nasunog yung sinaing ko...  But above all these terrible things that happened to me today, I still have to thank God for giving me a another day to live! :-)  SONG OF THE DAY...  I believe in you and me - whitney houston  I believe in you and me, I believe that we will be In love eternally, well as far as I can see You will always be the one, for me, Oh yes you will I believe in dreams again, I believe that love will never end And like the river finds the sea I was lost, now I'm free Cause I believe in you and me  I will never leave your side, I will never hurt your pride When all the chips are down, I will always be around Just to be right where you are, my love Oh, you know I love you boy I will never leave you out I will always let you in To places no one's ever been Deep inside, can't you see That I believe in you and me  Well maybe I'm a fool, to feel the way I do But I will play the fool forever Just to be with you forever I believe in miracles, and love's a miracle And yes, baby you're a dream come true I was lost, now I'm free I believe in you and me See I was lost, now I'm free Cause I believe in you and me Oh yes I do I believe in you and me

      It's a long day and my class is over. I need to go home na.  But although it's long day, I do had a good start because I do managed to solve a programming problem in PROG2 in just ten minutes. It's just a simple problem. But I don't know what will happen next. At least I had a nice start and that's nice for me.  Oh I need to study and do my assignments in calculus and statistics for the class tomorrow.  As for the SONG OF THE DAY... LEAN RIMES CAN'T FIGHT THE MOONLIGHT  Under a lover's sky I'm gonna be with you And no one's gonna be around If you think that you won't fall Well just wait until, 'till the sun goes down Underneath the starlight starlight There's a magical feeling so right It will steal your heart tonight  You can try to resist Try to hide from my kiss But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight Deep in the dark you'll surrender your heart But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight, No, you can't fight it It's gonna get to you'r heart  There's no escaping love Once a gentle breeze (once a gentle breeze) Sweeps it's spell upon your heart And no matter what you think It won't be to long 'Till your in my arms Underneath the starlight starlight We'll be lost in the rythm so right  It will steal your heart tonight You can try to resist Try to hide from my kiss But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight Deep in the dark you'll surrender your heart But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight, No-o you can't fight it No-o matter what you do The night is gonna get to you.  (Your gonna know) (That I know) Don't try you're never gonna win  Underneath the starlight starlight There's a magical feeling so right It will steal your heart tonight  You can try to resist Try to hide from my kiss But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight Deep in the dark you'll surrender your heart But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight, No-o you can't fight it  (repeat)

      Stress relievers...  My professor in NSTP discussed that. She emphasized that being stressed out makes a person. Stress relievers can be in the form of hobbies. So I realized that since I had so many stress busters, I consider surfing the internet is one of them. I enjoy looking for different web sites, and checking my email and friendster account.  And also, that was the first meeting with the prof. I rate her personality (1 as the lowest and 5 is the highest)... I'm giving her 5 because although she's 50 something and experiencing menopause, she's easy to get along with...

       CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WORKING ON A CALL CENTER?!   Everybody's working there. It's nice than being unemployed. Why do some people consider being a call center agent the one of the super non-sense jobs that the Philiippines have, where the people who didn't finish schooling go, and the last resort for the people who finished schooling but unfortunatelly did not got the chance to work to their own field. Sorry if the sentence is too long but I just have to release my sentiments this morning or else I'll be going to a mental facility.  This morning, the moment I opened my eyes, my father told me to stop schooling and work as a call center agent. He told me that I do not study and that I'm usually on the computer. For me, I don't study at home because I don't want to see his face and if I ever study at home, I do it usually at midnight where everybody is sleeping because that's the time where my mind is ready to concentrate. Why should they see if I do really study? So that they will tell my relatives and their friends that I do study hard. Hello?! Do they know the meaning of stress?  Sa bagay, wala naman sa kanilang bokabularyo yung salitang  "STRESS".                 *************************** To: All the youngest child in the family Subject: A BIG RALLY FOR OUR RIGHTS!  The Federeation of Youngest Children in the Family (FYCF) would like to call the attention of all the youngest children all over the universe to join our hands together and fight for our rights. We are being deprived of everything to give way to the elder children (or child if there's just two of you) in the family.  Elder child/children have everything they ever wanted, from the physical need down to the spiritual ones. If they need something to the parents, the parents give it to them right away. But if they need something to our parents, they (parents) tell us to wait, or they give us conditions. What the hell! Our parents and elder sibling/s always bother us when it comes to household jobs ("Do this, do that...). If the elder sibbling need something from us, they don't stop pestering our peaceful life until they get what they really want. They use their power over us. They are the ones why we always get into shame. From serving the guest to introducing ourselves in front of them. Let's unite and stop the abuse of our elder sibblings and our parents to us!

      Attention: All film and tv producers, directors, and talent scouts...  I discovered someone who will perfectly fit for every role you will give. She's too sexy and tempting to resist. Wanna who this sexy lady is? Well, she's no other than... Drumrolls...    MADAM AURING?!    Yes, she's Madam Auring. She got the asim to wake the taste sense of every man in this planet. She's the envy of every girl. It's not her fault to be sexy and the "guy-magnet". She can do every role you will give to her with ease, especially if it's a bed scene or any scene that requires the star to take away every piece of her clothing. Let's say that she's "sumusunod sa galaw mo."  She's also a versatile actress. She can do the following:  1.  Heavy drama - She can be the heroine/villain. 2.  Action - This woman loves guns, explosives and fight scenes... 3.  Suspense/Thriller - She can be the monster or the ghost.  Guys, this is one big opportunity to miss!

      First, I do really hate these children, spending time playing computer games or checking out their friendster account (though I admit that I have one). You see, they're wasting their time and money on those things instead of studying. And when they go to class, all their main topic is "Counter Strike" and "Ragnarok" which for me, just keeps me annoyed. And the owner of this shop (Web Guide, which is just around the&nbsp;vicinity) said that NO BYSTANDERS ALLOWED. And why would they ever consider these children hanging out here if THEY (children)&nbsp;have no business but to watch other people play or chat with other people.  Second, those bums around the Univeristy Belt which keeps on bothering the students eating or walking to their respective schools. What's inside their heads? Students are considered as rich people?! We students are getting nuts driving these people out of our lives.&nbsp; Government officials should do something on them, by simply driving them out of U-Belt and sending them to a nice relocation site. Or send them to jail! Hahaha! Bitchy me...  GAAAAAAAAK! The time's almost up! Gotta go!

        1.&nbsp; I do really hate Gloria... But I hate FPJ more...   2.&nbsp; Foreign policies that made the Filipinos live on shame on the eyes of the people of foreign langs...   3.&nbsp; The bums around the University Belt and other schools...   4.&nbsp; The professors who I wished they were not teaching anymore... Due to their belief "I am the teacher, I am the fountain of knowledge"...   5.&nbsp; Friendster... Wala lang!   6.&nbsp; Children (as in minors) inside internet cafes, playing counter-strike or ragnarok.   7.&nbsp; Children inside internet cafes, watching and wondering what the user do... It's none of their businness!  8.&nbsp; University of the East... They don't declare class suspension during rallies, transportation strikes, and storms... If they did, it would be at the end of the day or when the students got here after a bad trip from their houses...   9.&nbsp; Pop-ups... The greatest distraction on every surfer's life. All these and more soon...

      I have this problem in C++... How can I ever get the reverse value of a number? Oh well, I need to depend on Ronald. But I do have to make my own solutions. It's worth the work isn't it?

      To be honest, I really don't want to see my half-brother and my half sisters. I don't know why, I just don't want it. When I got to see my half-sister with her family, I feel so uncomfortable. I don't know the reason. As for my half-brother, he's so  pa-close effect . He sends me text messages which I habitually delete them.  Let's proceed to my evil wish list...  To my dad, I wish he'll pack up and go to Aklan and never come back. I don't want to see his face because I easilly get irritated.  To my sister, I wish she buy her own mobile phone so I can have my phone back.  As for myself, I wish that I could graduate from colleg, having nice (and good)&nbsp;grades, get hired on a nice job with a nice starting salary, and get my ass out of the house and never return.  Note: I'm only human, having evil thoughts is normal.

      WAAAAAAAAAAH!!! Umuulan na! Wala akong dalang payong. Sana maka-survive ako ng 4 1/2 hours kakahintay na humina or mas maganda, mawala na ang ulan at nang ako'y makauwi. Gutom na ako!

          Today is Friday, my favorite day of the week. Not only because it's the end of a long working/study week. It's because of Magic 89.9's "Friday Madness". I do really love the music they're playing. It's like a trip down memory lane. And that's the time where I do listen to REAL music.  Honestly, I do appreciate the songs that they say  pinag-lumaan na ng panahon . But I&nbsp;do appreciate&nbsp;the present songs.  Today is Friday. Tomorrow wil be Saturday... My worst day of the week. NSTP. And I do not like my classmates. Good thing Shayne, Ging, Rodel, Mark and Hanna are still my classmates. And I'm adding three more classmates who I consider NORMAL people... Rochelle, Blenda, and Constancio (also known as Marina)...

      Yesterday, I spent my day mostly eating. I don't know why. Maybe due to my tight schedule, I missed the joys of eating. I usually skip meals just to finish every assignment or study for the upcoming quiz. I also spend my money on surfing the internet for hours.  Well anyway, I had a great time eating. Here's what I ate yesterday... 1.The leftover adobo and large piece of biko for breakfast. 2.A footlong hotdog during my one and a half hour break. 3.22mL of slurpee at around 1.30 pm. 3.A glass of Pepsi and a few pieces of siomai at Siahara's residence. 4.3 pieces of palitaw and a glass of water at Siahara's residence also. 5.4 servings of rice and a bangus which was cut into two. I took the tail. That was when I got home from my humanities class which was my last class for the day (6:00 pm - 7:30 pm).  And after that, I do still craved for more. But I have to tell myself to stopeating because I'm already feeling full.

      I was reading an article about the topic and I realized how this little gadget and its amazing service can help us or send us to doomsday.  Let me mention first the advantages...  Mobile phones and SMS are the most comnvenient tools next to the computer and the internet. We get to reach our lost loved ones and friends through texting. If we wanted to ask something, it's one text message away. If we want to chat and dish out the darkest and the dirtiest "chismis" on anyone, then go reach out your phones... Our mobile phones and its mighty service can keep us updated with emergency situations. Plus, the service could cost you a buck, which means, you can be merrier! Also, for the prepaid subscribers, there are now called AutoLoad stations anywhere you go which makes reloading hassle-free when it comes to scratching cards or saviing money. And the price for reloading stars from 25 pesos up to 150 pesos.  Now going to the disadvantages...  As for mobile phones, people go for the style and the price. The more expensive the phone can get, the better. They don't even realize that they do buy a mobile phone because they want to get connected 24/7. And crime rates are getting higher because of phone snatching and robbery. I wonder, what if the snatcher or the robber got a 5110 or other lower models, would they return it to the victim and tell them, "Can you get a nice phone?!"  For the SMS, I would say that it can also do you harm, if you're the type of person who would go spread your number to the strangers. Beware... You might get killed. I remember an episode from a TV show where the victim gets killed by a simple text message. If you still can't get it, I'm talking about the "textmate" and "eyeball" thing. Or if you're the addicted one, you might get distracted with your studies (or work) because all you ever think is, "I'm waiting for that person to reply to my messge!" Wake up... You'd say, "Sana nag-expire na lang ang load ko" (for all the prepaid subscribers) or, "Sana di na lang ako nakipag-text sa kanya nang di tumaas ang bill ko" (for postpaid subscribers).
