      Can't wait for the weekend.. Well, tomorrow afternoon in actual fact.  Have booked a weekend down in the snow and will be carving it up on the slopes.  Had a few misgivings about whether there would be any dumping around this time of year, but it seems like an awesome start to the ski season and will be bloody brilliant.  The group I'm going with are an awesome bunch.. Matt, Lu (both my flatmates), Mikey, Tara and Kurt.. Great guys, know how to party and know how to live it up.  Fantastic.    Thanks to Tara's mum, we're going to get spolit rotten tomorrow night with a roast dinner in our Canberra stop off, then it's an early night and we'll be hitting the slopes early Friday morning.  Thank god for kickboxing and those strength exercises I say.. otherwise I'll be hurting after the first hour.   Also looking forward to the Apres skiing. I haven't skied in Australia before, so can't wait to check out the night life on Sat night. Fingers crossed I don't do anything stupid and cane myself. Tara and I are going to be ski buddies for the weekend, so no doubt we'll push each other. You just have to read this email I got from a friend of mine in response to that :   "...I can see tragic headline news like "Freak Accident on slopes for Competitive Freaks"...  A down hill skiing race turned competitive and then tragic for two female Sydnesians and a spectator.  The two birds (Ed.) began competitively racing each other down a difficult slope, when faced with a 'bump' in the snow field which launched the two females airborne in a side by side dual formation, rather reminiscent of the best efforts of Olympic synchronized swimmers.  The feat would have appeared magical for the lone spectator standing further down the slope, until the two would be professional downhill racers hit the spectator before landing, impaling him with a ski each through the midsection. Concerned over damage to their ski's the two speed racers began furiously trying to remove their ski's from the injured spectator, eventually tearing him in two before horrified paramedics could call for the sticky tape.  It's understood both girls were charged with SUI (Skiing Under the Influence) by Police, with a more serious charge of "Skislaughter" pending.  Offers of sponsorship are understood to have been made to both skiers to consider entering this year's Olympics in the demonstration sport of Synchronised Homicidal Skiing..."  Too much time on his hands me thinks !

      My girlfriend, Jill, got engaged on the weekend to the most wonderful Pete.  Jill and Pete are my idea of a perfect couple - totally, 100%, in love with each other.. It's a couple like that which restores my faith in relationships where two people can co-exist together for the rest of their lives.  Something which most of us search for, but only a select few actually find..    I feel it's a privledge to know them both.   Jill and I will be organising Jill's birthday on the 17 July - we poured over receipe books on Sunday (yes, the cheese and dips girl!) to figure out what canapes and cocktails we'll be making.  Something we both share a passion for - cooking.  Y'know, if I wasn't so used to my lifestyle, I'd be out there doing my chefs apprentice but then figured I love my nights and weekends too much at this stage in my life.  So we've actually created a menue of sorts, we just now have to get it into some sort of order.. another afternoon of cheese, dips, biscuits and wine me thinks - just to go over the finer details of course.   I actually thought yesterday might have been an alcohol free day, but guess what ?  I succumbed again.  Really going to have to think about fixing this rubber arm business.  I cooked dinner for my two flatmates, and as I sat down with my glass of water, Matt pulled out my fish-bowl red wine glasses and began pouring.  If I had of been thinking, I would have said no - but instead politely thanked him and raised my glass in a toast and opened the hatch (thank God it was only one glass). The fact that I wont be going kickboxing (my instructor is in the UK for the next two weeks) has concerned me that all this hard work is going to be completely undone by my inability to say no to alcohol.   Must admit, it feels good not to have a hangover for the first time since Friday morning.. yay me !

      What an awesome weekend ! However, I seriously think that not only do I have a drinking problem, but I've developed a serious eating disorder as well.  You wouldn't believe the amount of crap I shovelled into my body this weekend.  I managed to escape the evil Vortex and ended up drinking in the Eastern Suburbs with a different crowd, but pretty much the same sort of deal - my friends weren't satisfied until I was well on my way to being incoherent. Added to that we made a rather interesting trip to Hungry Jacks (this is proof of how drunk I was, cos normally I wont go near that crap), where we had to negotiate our way around 16 year old girls who had nothing better to do than to hang around some dodgy night club called OJ (or some name just as hiddeous), wearing next to nothing in the freezing cold.  What made this whole scenario even more amusing was the way all the boys stood off to one side in a group and all the girls stood away from them in their own little group as well.    Funny.    So having consumed HJs which was as tasteless as I remember from the last time I ate it 2 years ago, I realised that it was just time to go (you know when you reach that point where you could either keep drinking and make a total dick of yourself, or cut your losses and just go home before you hurt something or someone) - so I managed to almost fall down the stairs, but did this awesome side-step move that prevented me from tumbling, all the while declaring that no, I wasn't drunk, just happy.. Found my way to a taxi and made it home, breaking a nail on the way - which, strangely didn't worry me too much cos I had my nail appointment the next morning.  So get this, after I'd just had HJs, my flatmates mentioned they couldn't eat one of the pizzas they'd ordered and I was more than welcome to help myself. I really wish they hadn't said that cos I went a bit crazy.  Like nearly the whole pizza crazy. Ok, so yes, I was drunk, I can admit it now just not at the time.  But y'know what? I think it was because of the pizza that I woke up the next morning feeling bloody fantastic and yup, made it to kickboxing bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .. awesome !   So after my kickboxing and my nail appointment, I dropped by Simone's place for lunch.  Having vowed and declared that I ate enough to feed a small army the previous night, I didn't need food.. so what do I have when i walk through the door ?  A corona and piece of pizza.. Added to which we went to the Fish Markets and bought fries, calamari, prawns, bread rolls and chocolate coated strawberries.. and no, I didn't eat all that, but still managed to make a contribution.  I had to make a quick exit, so I said goodbye a few hours later and went home to do the house work.. Vaccumed and moppped the floors and generally tidied the whole place.    Sat night rolls around, and what do you know ?  I'm back drinking beer again.  Met up with two of my great friends, Mikey and Tara and before we're even off the train, another friend Scotty, has already purchased our beer at the pub and is waiting for us.. See what I mean about this whole drinking thing ?  I reckon it's a consipiracy against me.  Guess what I ate this time ?  (keep in mind it's been only 5 hours since I last feasted) .. A meat pie with sauce, fries, twisties, crunchie nuggest and 6 beers..   I should have gone to see Super Size me instead - but no, I wasn't through with punishing my body.   Sunday I actually slept in, then met up with my girlfriend Jill, who proceeded to open up a bottle of wine and put an assortment of cheeses, dips and crackers in front of me .. which I didn't really want, but still ate anyways.  Not only did we consume 2 bottles of wine, a baileys on Ice, champagne and I had two "old fashioned's" but I stumbled through my front door after midnight (sometime this morning) where I cooked myself 2 minute noodles, had peanut butter toast, and tuna on rice-cakes.    I have a slight hangover this morning, somewhat dulled due to my incredible eating abilities last night and over the weekend.  Kickboxing again for me this evening me thinks, along with a low-calorie diet for the rest of the week.

      It's Friday afternoon and I'm about to go downstairs for a cleansing ale.  The Vortex, as my group of friends affectionately call the Brooklyn Hotel, is named due to the fact that you can never go in for one drink - invaribaly there's always a group of work colleagues there to suck you in, pump you full of alcohol only to be spat out about 5 hours later, completely hammered trying to hail a taxi with ladders in your stocking and looking like you should be lying in the gutter, instead of bring the pristine person you were when you first walked in.  Fingers crossed I have the will-power to be able to put up my hand and claim that enough is enough after one drink.  The intention is there, but somehow I can see it turning into one of those usual Friday nights.  Mental note to self:  Have kickboxing in the morning, do not want to kill ones self (nor the rest of the class) with alcohol fumes.   Of course, a bit contradictry when I'm sitting at my desk as I type with an open beer not more than 20 centermetres from my keyboard.    Really, I'm not an alcoholic as many of you are probably thinking.. I just like to think I'm a social person.   Having said that, the weekend is rather full with social activities which does not include drinking alcohol.  I have kickboxing in the morning, my monthly nail appointment (*groan* I hear you all saying - but hey, it's one of my insecurities I can control !), catching up with a girlfriend for a non-alcoholic lunch (or that's the intention), catching up with another friend to see his new boat and going to an Aussie Rules match where, yes, a tonne of alcohol will be consumed.. Sunday morning is deemed my day of rest and will be spent blissfully in bed fantasising about my favourite man of the moment... Nicholas Cage.  Mmmmm... Nicholas..  I then have to meet up with another girlfriend to discuss her birthday plans, and then onto a typically eastern suburbish type party where everyone will have fake tans, fake boobs and fake smiles but claim to be your best friend.  Oh the pain !    On that note, it's time for me to venture into the vortex.. wish me luck - I think I'm going to need it.

      How many times have I tried to see Shrek II ?  I tell you what, it's like Groundhog Day.  The few times I've been meaning to go, I've ended up drunk at some place and incapable of sitting though a movie with hundreds of screaming kids. The other few times, I've been that hungover, the sight of a hundred screaming kids would make me want to throw up all over them.   Friday night, we actually made it to the cinema.  I conciously made the effort to go straight home after work, change out of my work clothes and went to the pub next door to home for *one* drink.  I even made sure I drove, so I could only have the one.    Tara turned up and had checked the times on the net.  So we drove to Randwick (took ages to get a park) and went to get our tickets. Umm.. no mention of Shrek on the boards.  Ummm.. Tara ?  I don't think it's on.  We get to the counter and sure enough, it was on at 9:00 on Thursday and 9:00 on Saturday, but not at nine-o-fucking-clock on Friday !   I was really mad.  So mad, I couldn't speak for about 10 minutes other than to say "how could you fuck it up ?  where's your attention to detail ?".   Of course, it didn't take me long to get over it and we eventually decided on seeing Mean Girls (which is a damn funny movie).  Still, I was hurting that we'd come so close, yet missed out again.   As it turns out, I got an sms from a friend on Saturday asking if we'd enjoyed the movie.  I told him that Tara had stuffed up the times and we still hadn't see it.. then, he rang me about 30 minutes later and told me that he'd get his friend to burn a copy to DVD and he'd give it to me Tuesday.. alright !  So fingers crossed I get to see it this week.    I bet you any money that   a) he'll forget to burn the DVD;  b) when I do finally get a copy, it wont work on our DVD player; c) a copy will be promised for weeks and we wont get it, by which time it would have finished at the movies; and d) I'll have to wait 6 months before I ever get to see it.   Of course, I'm hoping that none of the above happen - but hey, no expectations, no disappointments right ?  So if that's the case, then I'm going into this week with an open mind..  I'll keep you posted anyways !

      They say you should be careful what you wish for.. Funny how on Friday I was saying I hadn't had a bizzaro world night and look what happens.. Sat night, I got my wish.   Starting at the beginning, my weekend actually had the merits of being a quiet one.  I was in bed by 9:30 pm Friday evening.. up at a not-so-reasonable hour on Sat morning, headed around to a friends place to watch the Goonies (I love that movie !), then went home to get ready to go to the football.   It was at this stage I realised the evening was going to go downhill.   I met up with my girl, Tara, and her dad (who was visiting from Hong Kong) for dinner - sensational dinner, along with a lovely drop of red.  Then we mosied on to the football and admist drinking beer and smoking cigarettes (we managed to consume about 4 schooners of beer for the game) we shouted and yelled at the umpires.. fairly low scoring game, but our boys got up and it keeps the finals hopes alive anyways.  Then we went to the members bar, then we went to the Fox and Lion.  Then I can't remember much about conversations I had, other than I saw Paul Roos, the Swans coach and mumbled some drunken thing to him and freaked out about it for the rest of the night cos I could have said something a lot more wittier than I did.   Tara and I started a few drunken conversations with a group of boys, who were clearly not very interested in talking to us, but we still chatted away anyways.. then when it was time to go (ie, the house lights go on and we all look like a million dollars.. not !), we got into a very large taxi line and waited for ages for a taxi to take us home.. Somehow, along the way, I managed to pick up three boys who get in the taxi with me who want to go to a nightclub - so I tell them to go to Q-bar (not far from where I live) and they ask me to come along with them.  I don't want to go, but the offer to pay for me to get in and hang out with them.. so, what do I do ?  Yup, punish myself even further and go in with them.  Then, I end up meeting some friends within the first 2 minutes of being in the club and lose the boys I went with.. D'oh !  I was fairly hammered by this stage, so my excuse is I didn't really know what I was doing and I feel really bad the boys went to all that trouble.     As it turns out, we have a huuuugee night.. I end up in my friends hotel room until about 8:30 am where we're all listening to music and then I realise it's just time to go.. so I end up back at my place (my flatmates have only just got up) and I curl up on the couch and don't move for the remainder of the day.  I was meant to go and see Shrek II, but as usual, it seems I'm not destined to see this movie.  Something always happens and I never get to go.  Damn it !

      The mission, should I choose to accept it, is to have a relatively quiet weekend for a change.  Totally going to avoid the Vortex this evening and head straight home for a relaxing evening.  My flatmate will be cooking tonight, whilst her boyfriend is out partying with the boys at a strip club (God love him !).  If I wasn't so damn broke, I'd probably go and meet him there myself..  The last time I went to a stip club, one of the girls asked how long I'd been there.. "oh about 30 minutes" I replied.. to which she went "Oh my God, I thought you worked here !".. Ahhh... sorry love, thanks for the compliment (I mean, what other way could you take it ?) but have another line and see the world through rose coloured glasses again, yeah ?    Actually, it's been a while since I've had a bizzaro world night - you know those evenings where you get into siutations where you look back on them the next day and think "damn !  how funny was that ?!".  I think the last time was at my flatmate's birthday.  She'd been at the [horse] races all day and was completely hammered by the time I met up with her and her friends..  It was one of those evenings where everyone mingled, we all had a great time and everyone spoke with everyone.. After Lu had fallen off her chair for the second time and we had fixed her facinator and hair for the third time, Matt (her boyfriend) decided to take her home to bed.    The rest of us chose to go onto another place in the city.  We came across the Verandah Bar.  I've been there a few times - usually for after work drinks and is full of suits.  This particular evening [actually, I think it's every Saturday night], was RnB night.  Can I just say right now, that I really don't mind RnB in the right environment.  As most of us were dressed up in cute little dresses and high heels, we walked straight to the front of the line and the guys let us in - no cover charge.  In hindsight, I'm so damn glad we didn't pay to go in.  We walked through the front door and straight into the worst P Diddy rock video I've ever seen.  Or that's how I perceived it as. Try-hard wanna be, gangsta rapper types, chicks with ugg boots and mini skirts (what would have to be THE worst fashion foux par EVER) all trying to shake their booty, however it wasn't really coming together.  We checked the place out and thought "y'know, perhaps we're not really giving this place a chance..". And then it came. The. Worst. Pick-up. Line. Ever.  This guy sidles up to our group and says "This is your first time here, aint it ?".. "ahh, yes, on a Saturday night, it is".. He replies "I thought so.. Cos you chicks are the classiest chicks I've seen here tonight !".  Fuuuuuuuuck. Time to go ! We gather the group, do a head count to make sure we haven't lost anyone and make a b-line for the door.. Safety in numbers, safety in numbers.. that's all I could think about !  Anyways, we made it out of there and headed off to the next venue and partied the night away.. Mind you, it was a great topic for discussion the next day and a few laughs were had by all.     I think it's time for another one of those evenings..

      I don't think we could have asked for a better weekend than the one we just had.  The snow was AWESOME ! God must have been smiling on us cos the weather was amazing, the snow was plentiful and there were no queues OR kids on the slopes.  Our accommodation was supurb - right in the villiage (10 minute walk from the first chairlift), had a spa to rest those weary muscles and we were provided with breakfast and a 3 course dinner every day..   Must admit I was a little nervous to begin with, given I hadn't skied in about 5 years, but really, it's just like riding a bike - doesn't take long to get back into it. Tara and I were skiing down some blue runs after the first few hours.. A few funny incidents along the way tho - like when we totally missed the turn off to traverse back across the mountain and had to take off our skis and walk up the hill about 10 meters.. by that stage we'd lost Mikey and it took us (no joke) about 25 minutes to get our skis back on cos our boots were covered with snow underneath (mental note to self: clean boots before attempting to shove back into bindings).  By this stage we thought we were pretty shit-hot, so we decided to go down a run called High Noon.. at this point though, my boots were serverly cutting off the circulation to my foot - I was wondering why I couldn't turn to the left properly and feeling really uncoordinated.. yeah, as it turned out, we got too far down the run to pull out and it took me ages to get down.  Tara was half way down the mountain and couldn't really wait for me cos it was so damn steep, so here I was cursing and swearing at her, vowing and declaring that I was going to smack her out when I finally got down the hill cos she wouldn't wait for me and I couldn't feel my right leg and my glasses had fogged up and I was all alone... ok, ok, so a little melodramatic, but it's how I felt at the time ! But hey, I survived it and I'm here to tell the tale, so life is good again.   We were all pretty knackered by the time the day was over, so we all went to bed early and got up at a sparrows fart the next morning and were on the slopes asap.  Tara and I spent pretty much the entire day up the mountain and finally did a 5 km track down the bottom for lunch.. only to get stuck on a damn chairlift for 20 minutes on the way back up.. totally don't mind though, cos it meant we got to see Matt fully face plant it on a black run, right underneath our chairlift .. probably the highlight of the trip I think !   The Apres skiing was, well, non existent really.  We were all so tired we didn't stay up past midnight.. probably had a lot to do with the greenery we were smoking too, but having said that, I don't feel we missed out on anything and I was happy to crash and burn early (no pun intended !).   The drive back was fairly uneventful - other than eating a dodgy hamburger on the way home - but it was a leisurely drive all the same.  Had the day off work on Monday, purely to do sweet FA at home.. think I needed it cos I feel great this week.

      I'm in a bit of a dilemma.. You see, I met this Irish backpacker at our local pub about 2 weeks ago and whilst I think he's sweet, he's just sooo not in my world.. He's a nice guy and someone to have fun with, but I don't think it's a long term thing.  Or perhaps I'm just a commitment phobe now ?  Don't get me wrong, I've been in three long term relationships, but after being single now for the last two years, I have such an amazing group of friends and the most wonderful people around me that I feel pressured when I met someone.. Obviously, they're not the right person for me if I feel that way, but it seems *every* person I meet, I have the same feelings about.. with the exception of one person (who I'm still in love with, but I don't think anything will ever happen again).   Yup.. I'm a freak, me thinks !   Interesting, cos I always saw myself as one of those clingy, needy people who needed to have a person in my life to justify my existence.. however, I found that with each new relationship I was involved in, I always took along the bad bits of the other relationship into the new one (like trust, for example).  Now that I've had a chance to look at other people's relationships from a distance, I can see where I went wrong and why.  I've also found that I'm *me* for the first time since I was about 14 .. There's no one to fuck around with my mind and I actually have the guts to tell someone what I really think - quite frankly, if someone can't handle my honesty, then I don't want you in my life.. Harsh, I know, but hey.. I don't want negative people to drag me down - life's too short.   Y'know, I've noticed that I'm pretty good at dribbling shit.  I can't believe I've just managed to write two paragraphs about nothing..   So anyways...   Getting back to the Irish Backpacker, I've decided to have a bit of fun with him, but nothing too serious.  He knows what the deal is so he's not under any illusions that I'm in this for the long term.  Do you think that's a bad attitude to have ?

      I can not believe the difference it makes by not eating carbs for dinner.  I've decided I need to get back into shape for summer and have cut out rice and pasta for dinner - substituting with steamed veges instead.. and y'know what ? It works a damn treat !  I mean, I still kickbox at least twice a week, plus walk for an hour every day, so that probably helps too.. But cutting out the carbs has made such a difference. I think I've lost 1 or 2 kilos in the last two weeks (doesn't sound like much, but  the clothes are definitely feeling looser !).  I don't weigh myself as such, generally go by how tight clothes feel.. the bench mark is a pair of size 8 jeans - I can still fit into them, but they're starting to cut me in half - which means it's definitely time to get my eating in check :)  What a weekend this is shaping up to be - after being good all week, I'm going to let loose on Sat night.  I've organised a group of 20 people to go to Cafe Pacifico  urlLink http://www.cafepacifico.com.au/beta/index.php  - it boasts the largest range of tequila in Australia.  Hmmm..  the makings of a messy night me thinks !  I've also bought each person a shot glass, which I'll be getting each one individually ingraved with the person's name as a momento to those who make the night a memorable experience.  The only excuse a person has for not drinking tequila is if they've previously had alcohol poisoning from drinking the stuff.. otherwise, you're shit out of luck.   BUT - this is how damn clever I like to think i am - I managed to organise the dinner on the last night of football in Sydney - missing the cruicial Sydney v Essendon match.  It'll be an absolute cracker of a match, so I've organised a few key people to send me sms updates as the game progresses. .  Good one. Not !

      You would not believe I actually managed to see Shrek II last weekend.. Yay me !  Tara and I refused to actually name what we were planning to do for fear of jinxing ourselves yet again, but we made it and bloody hell, what a fantastic movie.  The cops scene had me rolling on the floor along with Farbucks on nearly every corner.. such a well written sequel to an already funny movie.  So my week has been a long one, even though it was a short one (due to the public holiday on Monday).  Was called into work on the Monday for a few hours, then had a  horrendous day at work on Tuesday..  Tell you what, I so needed to go to kickboxing on Wednesday night - I really had to hit something, and if it wasn't the punching bag, it was almost going to be my bosses head.. seriously, the guy needs to take a lesson in attention to detail.  I could have thrown him, along with my computer, outside our office window 15 storeys up.  Happy families now, of course, and we've just been having a discussion about the new guy starting in our team. My age (26), Russian, been in Australia since he was 13.. Someone I better get along with, cos I have to work 12 hours a day with him plus sit next to him.. a lot of time to spend with someone who has the potential to drive you up the wall !  Anyways - have been seriously thinking about chucking my job in and heading OS for a while, so it may be irrelevent if I don't like him !   Of course, it wont be till this time next year, so I'll be going on a fact-finding mission to try and figure out what I want to do with my life - I think it's that whole Saturn's return thing happening again.. or that's what I like to tell myself anyways.  Makes for an interesting read and doesn't make me feel like my life is so not in control.   Oh, and get this - had my eyes tested yesterday and I bloody need bi-focals !  How OLD do I feel ??  Ok, so maybe not bi-focals as such, but special glasses for the computer cos my eyes have worsened over the last two years.. Better to try to ellivate the problem now, me thinks, instead of regretting it later in life.  Fuuuuckk.. first it's the eyes, then the rest of the body will follow !!
