       Now, LORD, God establish forever the promise which you spoke about your servant and his house.  Do as you promised.  --2 Samuel 7:25 (my own translation)  What impresses (and frightens me) about this passage is the way that David talks to the LORD, his God.  The last sentence of this passage is in the imperative; David is telling God what He will do.  God will do as He as promised.  David is in essence saying: "Be true to Your word!  Be who You are!  Keep Your promise to me and my household!"  To someone who is young in their faith, it may seem as though David is over-stepping his bounds.  How dare a mortal man speak the eternal God in this fasion?  But, to those who have walked with the Lord for a while and had to lean on him, we recognize the necessity of this action.  To hold God accountable to His promises is to recognize that we cannot do this thing called life alone.  We need God's help.  We need His work in our lives. We need to trust that God will be there to help us or else we will never be able to go beyond our own selves.  In order to achieve greatness, we must lean on the one who is Greatest.

       "Our task is to help people concentrate on the real but often secret event of God's active presence in their lives.  Hence, the question that must guide all organizing activity is not how to keep people busy, but how to keep them from being so busy that they can no longer hear the voice of God who speaks in silence." --Henri Nouwen,  The Way of the Heart   How indeed.  In a world where people are looking for "balance," how does one create space the hear the still, small whisper of God calling us to a time of rest with Him?  Many philosophers talk about a need for balance in our lives.  The yin and the yang; the light and the dark; the sun and the moon.  These are symbols of a world of harmony and "give and take" that has developed over the years.  Developed? Yes!  Intended by God?  Maybe not.  [Jesus says] “Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.  Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."--Matthew 10:37-39  Busyness springs from a quest for balance because we think that, in order to be good at one thing, we have to balance that with time for family, friends, job, etc.  Look at many of the great people of history and you will see that they chased after one passion to the exclusion of everything else.  I pray that I will always follow the call of God and do those things that he would have me do.  I pray that I am always able to be unbalanced and chasing after a Jesus who is leading me deeper and deeper into a radical love and discipleship of Him.

      While I am new to blogging, I have been keeping a paper journal for years now.  There's something very romantic and comfortable about sitting with an empty bound book and a pen, writing down my thoughts, struggles, fears, and worries.  In fact, I really enjoy it and always probably will.  One of the the things that I dream of is giving my journals to a loved one just before I return to my home in heaven.  I picture them paging through them lovingly and longlingly, gaining new insight and wisdom from the scribbles inside.  This thought that one day I might actually help someone through my words really appeals to me.  It's with that idea, that these ramblings may give inspiration to someone, that I am starting this blog.  It's my prayer that these words may inspire you in some way.

      "Then John gave in to him."  Matthew chapter 3 gives us the familiar story of John the Baptizer (as he is called in the God's Word translation).  God's Word sets the table to look at John as a humble man.  He lived in the wilderness; he ate bugs and honey (could that be a new breakfast cereal?); he wore simple clothes of camel's hair and leather.  As we get the mental picture, we see a humble man and in our way of thinking, humble means mild-mannered.  But this mild-mannered image of John is blown from the water when the Pharisees and Sadducees come to see what he's doing.  Here we see that humility can have teeth as he takes these religious leaders to task, calling them a "brood of vipers" in the NIV, or "poisonous snakes" in the God's Word translation.  Humble men don't rile up the religious.  Humble men don't call people to change the way they think and act throught repentance.  Humble men don't raise their voice.  And most certainly, humble men don't argue with the Son of God.  Yet that's what John does.  When Jesus comes and asks to be baptized by John, John tried to stop Him.  He argues with the Son of God saying, "I need to be baptized by you.  Why are you coming to me?"  We know that John knows who this is because of his reaction and also because of his reaction to Jesus in the womb (see Luke 1:38-45).  Even so, John argues with Jesus about who is going to baptize whom.  He fights with God over this.  Perhaps I am reading too much into this, but I see a "humble" man who was so full of passion for his calling as the "voice of one crying in the wilderness" that he was willing to fight about it with the one who called him to it.  John felt so strongly about what God had called him to do that he was willing to question God Himself over how to best fulfill this mission.  Is that sinful?  Is that wrong?  Or is it dedication?  To me, this becomes sinful only if John were to have refused to follow the lead of Jesus.  But, as we read above, "John gave in to him."  John checks his understanding and passion a little bit and follows the will of his Savior.  This only happens because John is able to listen for the leading of his God and follows humbly.  Truly, John is a humble man, crying out in the wilderness and we could use a little more of his humility.

       "Where is the one who was born to be the king of the Jews?  We saw his star rising and have come to worship him."   Matthew chapter 2 remarks about the star that heralded the birth of Jesus Christ.  Twice it points out how it guided the wise men to Judea and eventually Bethlehem so that they could worship the king of the Jews.  I'm curious to know what that celestial event was.  Was it a star or perhaps a comet or some other special effect worked by the Father to mark the birth of His Son, Jesus Christ?  I don't really know.  I'm not curious enough to lose sleep over it.  However, whatever it was, it had to be big.  So why did Herod miss it?  Why did Herod not see the star that was rising over Bethlehem?  Why did this visit from the wise men call him to gather the chief priests and scribes to figure out where the Messiah was to be born; shouldn't he have known this himself?  Was he too busy?  Did he see it and not care?  Was he missing the message of God that was right there before his eyes?  Do I sometimes miss the message of God that is right here before my eyes?  I can't remember the last time I have just looked up at the stars for no good reason.  It's been a while since I last searched the Scriptures for the promises that God makes to me and all believers.  Before we get too hard on Herod for missing the star, we need to ask ourselves how perceptive we are to the signs and wonders of God that are going on around us as we speak.  One of the things that the story of the wise men points out to us is how the nations realized that there was something special happening here but Herod and the other Jews missed it.  Today, we need to look around and see what God is doing, lest there be a star over our towns and we don't even see it.

       "Jacob is the Father of Joseph, who was the husband of Mary.  Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called Christ."   Re-reading the gospel of Matthew, I was pouring over the geneaology that starts the book.  (Doesn't the KJV use the word "begat" so many times in this passage?)  Anyway, I noticed that there are 5 women mentioned in this geneaology, which is strange because usually it was usually only men who were mentioned.  This fact would lead one to think that these must have been godly women of favor to have been included in the lineage of the Savior.  If you think that, you're wrong.  We read all about Tamar's exploits in Genesis 38, how she seduced her father-in-law, Judah, and had illegitimate twin boys, Perez and Zerah.  Anyone who is familiar with the story of the fall of Jericho knows how Rahab was a prostitute in that city.  Ruth was not even a child of the promise; she was a Moabite, an outcast from the nation of Israel.  Bathsheba was an adultress with King David.  While the blame is usually on David for this relationship, let's not forget that it takes two to tango.  And then there was Mary who also acknowledges her need for a Savior (see Luke 1:47).  Most of these women mentioned were not glorious; they were notorious.  If we were to look at the outward actions of their lives, we would conclude that they would certainly be excluded from the line of the perfect man, Jesus Christ.  Yet this is not the case.  Even through the family that the Father chose to be the seed-bed for his Son, the Father hints at what His ultimate purpose is.  He is about the redeeming of sin (not punishing it) and bringing sinful people into His plan (not excluding them).  His power is so great that He can take the sins that we do and, with some pain and suffering, work them out for His good.  Even in looking at the family of Jesus Christ, we see how He rescues the imperfect.

      I was digging through some of the things I had written about a year ago and just filed away on my computer.  What follows may be long but it's worth considering, I think  The Spirituality of Play       Each of us is always in such a hurry to grow up.  When we are five, we can’t wait until we are six.  When we are half-way through our sixth year, we are suddenly “six and a HALF!” and we don’t let anyone forget it!  When we turn 8 or so we start to pick up baseball gloves and footballs and suddenly play has to have rules and comparisons, what is right or wrong, legal or illegal, which player is better, who’s the best on the team, who’s the last one to get picked.  Play becomes serious business.  At age twelve, play is reserved only for sports.  The Barbies and the G.I. Joes and the Legos are all hidden away in the attic or worse…sold off as a grab bag at a garage sale for a dollar.  Next come the teenage years where there is no play because everything is so serious and so much about life and death.  “If Bobby Jones finds out I have a crush on him, I will just DIE!”  Play is forgotten or focused on sports, choirs, school, or plays.  We think we have the world figured out and then tragedy strikes:  we graduate.       In college, we remember how to play for just a little while.   The introduction of new freedom takes us back to when we were able to ride our first bicycle.  There is no curfew, no watchdog, no guidepost, no security blanket for our lives any more.  We are finally adults, standing on our own, making our own decisions, making our first mistakes without the comfort of family.  We find help in the arms of people who were strangers last semester, but after a few months of Introduction to Chemistry and slaving over the Periodic Table together, they have become the sibling we never knew we had.  However, we never play together.  We are too busy studying, working, chasing people of the opposite gender, and worrying about life after graduation.       And, before we know it, we’re there.  We are living on our own far from home…even if it is just a few miles away.  We come “home” to an empty apartment and turn on the television so that we have something to talk about at work the next day.  All the while wanting nothing more than to change out of our “work clothes” and into our “play clothes,” to jump on our bicycle, ride around the neighborhood, and have adventures like we did before.       Some will become adrenaline junkies, pushing themselves to the outer limits of human tolerances.  Adrenaline is a fickle mistress.  As with any kind of junkie, the desire for more will eventually burn them up.  The lengths to which we will go in order to play!       Of course, we think that God is not in our playing.  We remember from 1 Corinthians 13 how that works: “When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; but now that I am a man, I put childish ways behind me.”  The spiritual life is no place for a child.  It is a grown up world of reason and thought and discussion and conversation with scholars and pedigreed people who have paid more money than we have so that they can prove that they know more than we do.        Or is it simply that they forgotten more than we have?  Have they forgotten how to play?  I have never known joy to be an intellectual pursuit…it’s always been a feeling in my heart.  I have never known joy to come from a book.  I have experienced humor, laughter, insight, and many other positive things from a book, but never have I known joy.  Joy comes from experience.  Joy comes from living.  Paul was able to write from prison, “Rejoice in the Lord always!  Again, I say, rejoice!”  Joy comes from a relationship, not a process.       Play is a new spiritual discipline.  It takes effort to shut off everything and play… with God, with kids, with pets, with ourselves (not that way).  To take some time to be active in accomplishing nothing but living the fancies and fantasies of God, listening for the evidences of his love, takes discipline in this task oriented, highly effective world.  The spiritual discipline of play is waiting for Him to come to the houses of our grown-up lives in his muddy T-shirt, blue jeans with holes in the knees, and last year’s tennis shoes, and say, “Can Tommy come out to play?”       Of course I can Jesus.  Let me change my clothes first.

       "﻿Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord"  --Acts 3:19  I had never read this Scripture this way before.  At least, I don't think I had.  What a wonderful progression from confession to absolution to new life.  It starts with repentance: changing the way that we think and the way that we act.  It starts with not accepting things as they are now but rather looking for a change, a newness, a different way.  Where do we find that different way?  In God, as we turn to Him.  We have realized that our way is not working, so we look to God in repentance.  We look to Him in a way that says that we are broken but He can fix us.  We turn to Him because, after all of our searching and hunting, He is the only one who can effect the change that we are looking for.  That change starts with the stripping off of the old; the forgiveness of sins.  Sometimes it's hard to surrender to the Father's superiority and admit that we are sinful and that those sins need to be wiped out.  God is always more ready to forgive than we are to confess.  Confession is weakness, meekness, helplessness.  Confession is giving up and not giving in to the myth that we can fix ourselves.  But it's also the realization that God can do more through us than we could ever do for ourselves.  It's the realization that the sin that we are trying to fix is really holding us back.  God strips our sin away so that we can get on with what He wants for us.  The thing God desires for us is refreshing.  Refreshing our strength, refreshing our minds, refreshing our attitudes, refreshing our spirits.  Refreshing is the gift of that change, that new way that repentance is looking for.  Many times, it doesn't come the way we wanted it but it is welcome...sometimes.  We struggle with the changes that this refreshing challenges us to make, but that struggle leads us to cofession and repentance and the process begins again.  O Father, hear our repentant prayer.  Give us your refreshing.  Amen.

       "And my tongue will continually mutter Your righteousness and your glory all day."  (Ps. 35:28, my own translation)   "And, having the same spirit of faith, according to what has been written, is still written, and will always be written: 'I believed, therefore I spoke,' we also believe and, for this reason, we speak."  (2 Cor. 4:13, my own translation)  Continually, on-going, not-stopping, never-ending...continually.  This word describes God's Word and our words.  2 Corinthians 4:13 talks about how we speak because we believe.  The "continually" part of this is not so much our words as it is God's Word.  The original Greek throws a perfect participle in here when it talks about what has been written.  The perfect tense carries with it a sense of eternity, a continual aspect that is rarely translated.  The NIV and the KJV both say "It is written," which leaves the door open for the question "Is it still written?"  The perfect in the Greek lets us know, as I have pointed out, that what is written in God's Word will always be written in God's Word.  It does not change.  It is continually eternal, just as the Spirit who inspired it is continually eternal.  How great is that?!  I think there's some movie line that says, "The only thing that is constant is change."  As I look at my life, I can't help but agree.  Change is a constant in my life, whether it's my schedule, my attitude, my priorities, or my perceptions.  These are always changing; they never stay the same.  The good news is that God does not change.  His schedule is the same; His attitude toward me is the same; His priorities in this world are the same; His perceptions are the same.  Even though I may not know where I am or what I am doing or where I am going or what I am thinking, I do know where God is, what He is doing, where He is going and what He is thinking because it has been written down forever in His Word.  This unchanging Word speaks to me in my changes, calling me home to a God who is waiting with a continual love for me that doesn't care where I haven't been and what I haven't done.  So, I use my tongue to continually mutter the glory and the righteousness of God.   All day, I will continue to speak about His righteousness.  As I mutter this Word, it is not God who changes; I do.  I am changed by the Word.  I am the metal that is formed by the hammer and the anvil. I am the clay that is changed into a beautiful pot.  His Word does this change in me.  Continually.

      Hey everyone!  I don't know if anyone is still checking this spot, but I am not here much anymore.  My good friend, Jeff Schanze, and I are sharing a blog as a way to carry on theological dialog.  You can find us at  urlLink www.jeffandtom.blogspot.com  .  Most of my postings will be found over there.  See you there!

      So, I arrived back at church at 6:00 p.m to a warm, setting sun and a balmy 75 degrees.  Did some farewell greeting, had a laying on of hands to send me away, and a Confirmation Vision meeting.  It all lasted until just after 9:00.  Got into the car to find that it was 43 degrees.  That's right, more than 40 degree drop in temperature in just over three hours.  Gotta love living in Wisconsin...NOT.  Speaking of the Confirmation Vision meeting, it went so well!  We are looking at switching to a new  urlLink Confirmation Program  and it's been received really well.  It's really exciting...too bad I won't be around to see it begun.

      This post is more of a procrastination than anything else.  My desk has been in many different stages of messiness.  If you imagine a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being sparkling and uncluttered and 10 being piled to the ceiling with junk, I've been from 7 down to about 3 and now back to about 5.  My days have been spent getting resources together for my year-long sabbatical.  The new CD burner in my laptop has made it so that valuable hard drive space can be preserved for more important things (read: games).   So, rather than getting things ready for my leaving, which has been the ultimate goal, I am taking a few steps backward and making even more for myself to do.  *sigh*  Better buckle down and get at it.

      Tempted by the warm air wafting in through the bedroom window this morning, I laced up my running shoes and headed out for a morning run.  The endorphins must have set in early because I actually enjoyed it.  I was looking forward to a 20 minute jaunt, hot shower after, fresh cup of coffee and it would be a great day.  Yeah, right.  My 32 year-old, falling apart, 250 pound-carrying knees didn't quite cooperate.  It's not that I'm really out of shape; most people can't believe that I weigh as much as I do.  I do have a pretty muscular physique to go with my weight.  Sure, if I had a flat, there'd be a spare tire available for use, but still.  I think part of it is my shoes, but the bigger part is my gut.  Anyway, I made it about 15 minutes and then had to make the "walk of shame" back to home.  At least the shower was hot and the coffee was good.

      Well, I have survived another Wednesday night.  Now that I don't have to teach as much, it's a bit better but there's still one minor bump along the way: Game Night.  Tonight it was Capture the Flag...relaxed style.  Same basic concept: get both flags to your side of the field.  The relaxed part was things like boundaries, where to put the flag, etc.  The one steadfast rule was, if you tagged someone, you had to take them to the common jail, which meant that you were out of the game.  So, while kids were running over the better part of a square mile, there were many screams of "That's not fair." and "Can they do that?"  Yup.  They could do that until it became dangerous (chasing each other on asphalt could mean monstrous road rash).  Along with that, it took a while for them to learn about "acceptable attrition."  Tonight wasn't so bad because it produced two teachable moments.  First, we were able to talk about the need for rules.  At first, everyone thought that no rules was cool.  But, after a while, the unpredictability and the lack of appeal process lost it's luster.  That's what God's rules are all about.  He's not trying to cramp our style; he's trying to keep us safe.  Besides, there is plenty of room to play inside his rules.  Second, we talked about true love.  Everyone was so worried about themselves getting caught that they didn't see that if they got caught, their team could win easily.  With flags so far apart and with having to take people to jail, there weren't enough people to go around.  To simply allow yourself to be captured so that your team could take the flag would have ended most games inside of 10 seconds.  But, it's not in our society or nature to allow that to happen.  It's all about us...or so we think.  Jesus said, "Greater love has no man than this: that he lay down his life for for his friends."  And this isn't just laying down our life to the point of death.  To lay our lives, our time, our wants, our desires down to help a friend is the greatest love.  To ask our spouse if we can help in any way.  To not just "get out of the way" but to get into the fray of ministry.  Hopefully I can learn this lesson myself.  So, to answer my own question, why do I do it?  I do it in the hopes that the next generation will learn the lessons above before I did.  I do it so that the next generation will be more faithful than the current one.  I do it because God has made me for it.

      Ah yes, today we delve into that age-old question: Should you work with your spouse?  I'm leaving for a year; Sara's filling in for me.  It's good all the way around because it keeps Sara busy (and employed) while also having someone who won't mind when I come back next year and take my job back.  But I digress...  So, today's Wednesday, THE busiest day of the week.  I have Sara come in and learn some of the ropes for what happens on Wednesdays.  To be honest, now that we don't have the 8th grade class to teach, it's not too much.  Anyway, I have her lay out the news and notes, prepare the lesson for tonight, and generally get a feel for what's happening.  There's just one minor flaw on my part: I forget that Sara doesn't read minds.  I found myself expecting her to do things that she should have no earthly idea that she should be doing.  There were expectations that I had but I hadn't communicated them to her yet.  When I found myself losing it, I paused and thought about why I was mad.  I realized that I had no right to be upset with her for something that I hadn't explained.    I also realized that it may be my own anger at having to leave a place that needs me and wants me for another place that may not need me or want me at all.  Oh well, it wouldn't be the first time that I was someplace where I wasn't need and/ or wanted.  I'll just have to win them over with boyish good looks and charming personality.  Or else just hide somewhere out of the way until it's all over.  To answer the question above, it was good to work with my wife today.  I hope that she would say the same.

      Okay, so maybe my exuberance of earlier was a little premature.  After a straight 8 hours of configuring my new laptop, I am suffering from some serious eyestrain.  It's good to look away from the screen every once in a while.  The transfer of files went pretty seamlessly.  In an effort to be thorough, I synched my Palm as well as importing a .pst from my old computer's Outlook program.  Got doubles of just about everything, except e-mail.  Ah well, gives me an excuse to purge some of my old contacts that I don't necessarily need anymore.  However, the good news about all that is that the T3 synchs up pretty well with the new machine; that is, I did it right. :-)  My good friend Ty's 8600 plays Enemy Territory pretty well, so he says.  I'm having a bit of a problem with my home network staying active long enough for me to get the full version of the file.  I'll try a bit later downstairs, closer to the wireless beacon.  On a "lighter" note, it's crash diet time.  When I went to CHOBC  almost two years ago, I dropped almost 20 pounds in 10 days.  I'm trying to pull that off again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah...I know, it's not too healthy.  But neither is carrying around 250+ pounds on a 6'1" frame.  The good news is that I should be able to keep it off, given my activities of the upcoming year.  The stakes aren't as high this time around either.  Last time, if I didn't do it, I would have gone home.  No such luck this time.  If I'm heavy, they'll take me anyway and remedy the situation.  Okay, enough staring at this screen.  Time to put this thing away and get on to something completely different.

      I am in hog heaven right now!  Here's why:  Yesterday, I came home to find my new ATI Sapphire Radeon 9600 Video Card with 256 DDR RAM on board waiting for me.  Installation was quick and painless and I was fragging at top speed in no time.  It's also got a TV out so that it will be how I watch DVDs in Georgia.  Today, I met the UPS truck at church.  The UPS guy had a brand new Dell Inspiron 8600 which my church purchased for me to help me to do my ministry to soldiers over the next year.  While I now have the pain of transferring files over and re-install a bunch of stuff.  But, for the upgrade, it's worth it.  By the way, my church is WAY TOO GOOD to me.  I thank God every day that I serve the people of St. Paul Lutheran Church.  They are AWESOME!  Anyway, I am late for lunch with my wife.  I'll write more later.

      Well, I did some math today.  About 18 months ago I begged my first guitar off my in-laws and started to plinking around with it.  After 6 months of that, I bought an "entry level" guitar and kept going and boy, did my fingers thank me.  So, I have spent the last year or so teaching myself to play, downloading chord sheets to play music and just kind of farting around.  Tonight, I sat down and flipped through the songs that I could play somewhat.  My repertoire has expanded to just over a dozen praise songs and a few classic rock tunes (I've almost got "Cat's In the Cradle" by Harry Chapin down).  Of course, the lessons that I have taken over the last seven weeks have helped a lot, too.  Thanks, Armand and the guys at the Christian Music Center  I was zooming right along through my songs and TWANG!  I busted a string.  Usually I am pretty good at changing my strings before this happens, but I was surprised by it tonight.  Not to worry, though, because I have some spare strings around.  I'll be right back at it in no time.  I am *this close* to feeling comfortable playing in front of people.  I am hoping to use this skill to enhance my ministry to young people and soldiers.  Also, I am finding a lot of joy in singing praises to God in my basement...even if I do just kinda fumble along sometimes.  "Make a joyful noise to the Lord" it says in the Psalms.  Well, I am having fun and it certainly is noisy.  Thank goodness my wife doesn't hear too much of what happens down here.  Bottom line, I am not disappointed with my current skill level.  I'll never "go pro" but I'll certainly be able to lead some praise and worship in the near future.

      Well, I may be breathing new life into this spot once again.  The blog with my friend Jeff seems to have fizzled, in light of God changing his plans (and mine...see below).  *shrug* No big whoop.  I still love him.  For those of you who read this and maybe don't know, I'm headed off to active duty with the Army.  I'm going east...to Ft. Benning, Georgia.  Hopefully no farther east than that. :-)  With that in mind, this expedition that we call "life" is going to get a whole lot more interesting and, for the time being, I'm going to post some thoughts and feelings about that stuff here.   Stay tuned.

      The difficulty that I feared is coming to pass today.  We had a staff lunch and I found myself just sitting there amongst my own thoughts and fears, already distancing myself from the rest of the staff.  I didn't want to talk, joke, or engage because these things are to love and to love is set myself up to hurt.  I already know that I'm going to hurt but I don't want to hurt any more than I have to.  So, instead, I have to sit with my thoughts, fears, and unexpressed love and swallow them all so that I don't hurt.  I'm a big fat chickenbaby!  Rather than tell these wonderful people how much they mean to me, I sit there by myself and in myself and with myself in a room full of friends.  Man, what an opportunity I missed.  It's not getting easier...and the hardest part is yet to come.  More on that after it happens.

      Today has been a crazy day; I am so lost.  It started with a fight over a dumb piece of paper that meant more to me than my wife's feelings.  Not that this is right; it's just the way that it was.  I'm so frustrated, confused, scared, excited, optimistic, and negative all at the same time.  It's so hard to feel anything.  So, when I don't know what to feel, I feel anger and blow up.  Unfortunately, I blow up a lot at Sara because she's close.  It's not right; it's just the way it is.  I'm working at it...please be patient with me.  Tomorrow's going to be the harder yet.  Saying good-bye to the staff is going to be very very hard.  A lot of good partners and helpmates that I would love to bring with me.  We could change the whole Army if I could get them to come with me.  But that's not in the plan.  It would have been had I written it but, for some reason, God didn't see fit to ask me.  Something about being the Creator, I guess.  At least that's how Job tells it.  I'm so lost.  I have no world.  I have two and I can't do anything in either one.  It's so much like eschatology, so much like being a man of faith that it's not even funny.  To keep going in this ministry in the Church, knowing that the plans that I make and the seeds that I sow will probably be harvested by someone else.  Paul planted, Apollos watered, God gets the credit.  God gets the credit.  Amen.  I'm so lost.  Lost in myself.  Lost in my emotions.  Lost in my tasks.  Lost in my callings.  Lost in everything.  I pray that God will come and find me...soon.

      Today was a first that I had long waited for.  Today, I played in my first LAN party.  It was a lot of fun!!  We tried playing StarCraft at first, but we couldn't get everyone on the network.  When that didn't work, we played  urlLink Medal of Honor: Allied Assault .  It was a free-for-all DeathMatch and I showed them what sniping was all about.  It was great to see all my friends fall from my headshots.  Yeah, it was a great afternoon of killing each other in good Christian love.

      I have been really conflicted over my year-long commitment to the Army.  I am honored to serve my country, yet I know that I am called to youth ministry at St. Paul.  As I tried to put this into words, I thought of the words of Revelation 2:4, "I have this against you: you have forgotten your first love."  My first love is serving my Savior in his Church and connecting kids to Christ.  I can't forget this.  But, my second love is my country.  I am so thankful to live in a country where I can boldly proclaim the truth of Jesus Christ.  I am thankful to be able to write what I want and post it on this blog.  To me, words like loyalty, Duty, Respect, Service, Honor, Integrity, and Courage mean something, in fact they mean almost everything to me.  These aren't just abstract, archaic words; these are concepts that I want to be part of my character, that I strive to live each and every day of my life.    I feel very honored that I am able to serve my country over this next year.  I'm very humbled to be a part of a congregation that will give me the time necessary to do that.  Serving my Savior Jesus in their midst is my first love and I won't forget it.

      Today was a one of those days that will stay with me forever.  It's my last Sunday in Wisconsin; this time next week, I'll be somewhere on base at Ft. Benning, Georgia.  Being such, we had a special commissioning and sending of me as a Missionary to the Military for the next year.  We also installed Sara as our "Interim Director of Youth Ministry."  It was great to be able to lay hands on Sara and pray for her ministry over the next year.  Following services, there was a pot-luck in my honor.  Man, if you are going to have a last meal, a pot-luck is the way to go.  I didn't over-eat too bad and I got a good taste of the best that St. Paul's has to offer.  Following the meal, there was a short program to send me on my way.  Some good friends, Beth, Larry, Don and Tom all had some great things to say.  There was the requisite gag-gifts, mostly Looney Toons to go with my growing collection.  Then I had a chance to share some of my feelings with the church, as well.  They were very appreciative of me; and I am certainly appreciative of them.  Many tears were shed by them and by us.  It's finally starting to hit me that I am leaving for a longer time that I am ready to admit.  This evening, we went to Youth Worship down at the  urlLink The Upper Room .  At the end of worship, some girls from our youth ministry stood up and shared how much they are going to miss me.   It was good for me to hear this because I had wondered if I was making any kind of difference.  It's been a great affirmation of my ministry here.  Why is it that these affirmations come when we are leaving?  The great thing is, like MacArthur, I shall return.

      Tonight it was my pleasure and honor to attend the the 2nd Annual Sheboygan County Sheriff's Honor Guard Banquet.  Sara and I had a great time.  She got to play dress up, put on a really nice cocktail dress, a new pearl choker, and she got me into my dress blues.  It's my second year for being able to do this and I really had a great time.  The only problem was that my day started way too soon.  I also got up early and went to 2nd Brigade headquarters to drop off a couple of pieces of equipment that I still had.  It was good to touch base there one last time...for the next year.  Early starts don't make for late nights and I also have to work tomorrow.

      Today Sara and I fulfilled our Friday ritual of going down to Cedarburg for coffee and fun.  Usually, Ty and I take off for a hour bike ride and Denys and Sara head to  urlLink Cedarburg Roastery  for coffee and conversation...and chasing after  urlLink Bryan and Zachary .  Well, 45 degree temperatures and 10 mph winds don't make for great biking conditions, so we all went to get coffee and have some good conversation.  After that, it was over to  urlLink Mayfair Mall  for a little shopping for the women and more chasing after the boys for the men.  After lunch we parted ways.  More shopping for the gals; back home for the boys, where Ty and I played duelling Dell Inspiron 8600's, swapping files and showing each other great things on the the internet.  It was a techno-geek's paradise!    When the ladies got back, they spent the time constructing some really delicious cakes.  I got a chance to fulfill my "unclely" duties by teaching the boys some bad habits.  Tonight's bad habit: licking the beaters after mixing cake batter.  Zach's just a bit young for this lesson, but Bryan dove right in.  Took a little bit of practice to get his tongue to go where he wanted it but, in the end, the beater was cleaner and Bryan's face was dirtier.  Mission accomplished!  Days like today are some of the things that I am going to miss the most about being gone for a year.  But, weird as it may sound, I believe that it's because I am willing to go and do what I do, that we can enjoy days like toda

      I have officially dubbed today "Q-Day."  While I wish I had the creative juice to throw together a sentence or two heavily accented with the letter "Q," I'm a bit fried at the moment.  I call this Q-day because one of the Companies here was qualifing with their M16A2's today.  For the past two weeks they have been learning safety, breathing, aiming, firing, and all that goes into using their weapon with proficiency.  It's a tough day for many because this is a skill that is not dependant on anything that may have led them to the Army.  It's not just the fast people, the strong people, the smart people, the "gamer" people, the country people, the city people, or the suburban people who qualify.  There's little to know way of looking over a group of Soldiers and saying, "He'll qualify marksman" or "he can't hit the broad side of a barn."  There are people who get everything else who have a hard time qualifing.  There are people who are "rocks" (not a term of compliment) who score well.  It's a very subjective thing.  Anyway, in the end, to qualify, a soldier must hit 23 out of 40 targets...58% to be considered "proficient," or Marksman.  If he can hit 30 out of 40 (75%), he's considered a Sharpshooter.  If he hits 35 out of 40 (88%), he's qualified as an Expert or Sniper.  For many that I saw today, just hitting the 23 was hard enough.  I didn't see anyone hit more than 28.  Like I said, it's not like you can pick out which people are going to be good at this.  But, it is a skill that can be learned, there is not question, quandry, or query about that!

      Like what I've done with the joint?  Yeah, I am a master of the point-and-click.  My blog client  urlLink Blogger  has put up some new templates.  I thought the nautical theme would fit the title.  Plus, I dig most things having to do with ships.  Weird that I'm in the Army, huh?  I think that big water is romantic, but I get stir-crazy/ claustrophobic pretty easily.  So, with that in mind, lighthouses, seashores, and boats that come back to the dock every night are pretty cool.  Let someone else travel around in a grey-steel prison.  I'll take the mud to the open sea any day!

      Hey everyone!  Did you miss me?  Well I missed you all!  How's everyone doing?  That's good.  Here's what's up with me.  As you can see, it's been about six weeks since I last posted here.  It's been a long time of changing, moving, waiting, moving, waiting some more, and then working like a madman to get caught up from all the changes and moves and so forth.  So now I am settled into my new digs at Ft. Benning.  I'm with an Infantry Training Unit out on Sand Hill.  It keeps me busy.  I'm usually here by 5:30 in the morning for Physical Training (PT) and if I'm out of here by 5:00 p.m., it's an early day.  Lots to do.  It's taken some time to adjust, but I'm getting there.  I'm just wrapping up a week as the Staff Duty Chaplain for the post.  Thanks be to God that it was pretty uneventful! (knock on wood)  I'll be "off duty" tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.  Then I can finally get back to doing PT and getting ready for an upcoming Fitness Test.  Hopefully, now that things have settled down, I'll be back here putting up posts and telling you all how it's going.  Stay tuned for more info on a regular basis!

      Hey all!  I am typing this from the comfort of my couch as I get ready to head into bed.&nbsp; I finally got a cable modem in my apartment and a wireless router to boot.&nbsp; Woo Hoo!&nbsp; Not that I don't like to go to Fountain City Coffee, but it's much easier to do it from home.  Hey, don't be depressed if I don't post for a while.&nbsp; I'm leaving Saturday for Camp Okoboji in NW Iowa for a week.&nbsp; Sara and I are able to salvage a week of our 2 week vacation that we had planned in December.&nbsp; Our plans went to pot when the Army got involved.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I missed RAGBRAI this year because we chose a week with some good friends over a week of biking across Iowa together.&nbsp; Anyway, I'll be back around 9 AUG, so don't worry!  See ya!

      Okay, so maybe I should have put this post first, but I didn't so lump it.  It's interesting to watch an action&nbsp;movie at a theater on a military post.&nbsp; Here's some things you&nbsp;have to deal with:  1.&nbsp;   Camelbaks abounding  .&nbsp;&nbsp;Most 18-20-year-olds show off with their sneakers, jeans, or even underwear.&nbsp; I think that's why they&nbsp;wear the pants down to their butt-cracks, so they can show off the boxers that they spent $30 on.&nbsp; Not here at Ft. Benning.&nbsp; No, the status-symbol here is Camelbaks.&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Click here  for a run-down of what I see every weekend.&nbsp; All over Main Post, you see people with really short hair, baby faces, and these huge backpacks.&nbsp; I don't know where they're going or what they need to haul, but they do it.&nbsp; For the most part, I can just go with the flow...until they all go to the movies together and suddenly there's less leg-room that a Southwest Airlines flight.&nbsp; What does one need a Camelbak at a movie for?  2.   A failure to suspend disbelief  .&nbsp; Ft. Benning is home to some of the most Hooah! (it's an Army thing) Schools/ Units in the Army.&nbsp; Groups like the  urlLink Airborne School , and  urlLink the Rangers , and the&nbsp; urlLink United States Army Sniper School, &nbsp;all call some part of Ft. Benning "home."&nbsp; So, when you go into a movie where they have&nbsp;a level of&nbsp;expertise, the crowd is full of groans and hushed conversations about how this is all "fake."&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; It's fake?&nbsp; You mean there really isn't someone named Jason Bourne?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; This all some elaborate story about some ficticious person?&nbsp; What was I thinking?&nbsp; I thought this was real.&nbsp; I mean, if I wanted fiction, I'd go see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9-11 . (Don't believe it's fiction?&nbsp; Read the 9/11 Commission Report.&nbsp; I dare you!)&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I come to a Matt Damon movie, I expect realism!  3.&nbsp;   Prolific use of chewing tobacco  .&nbsp; So I'm munching on my popcorn and snarfing down my new movie fave: Reese's Pieces when I see the kid next to me digging into his cargo pocket.&nbsp; He pulls out a Skoal can!&nbsp; The next thing I know, all I can smell is the sickening mix of mint and tobacco.&nbsp; He puts a pinch between his cheek and gum, pulls out a styrofoam cup and enjoys his movie Southern-style!&nbsp; Yeah, because there's not enough grease and salt in my popcorn, or sugar and chemicals in my Coke and Reese's Pieces to kill me.&nbsp; Nope,&nbsp;I need some carcinogens just to prove that I am 20 and going to live forever.&nbsp; This is one thing that I've noticed: It's too hot to stick a burning mixture of weed and&nbsp;paper in your face.&nbsp; No, if you want the pick-me-up that tobaccy offers, you gotta chew it down here.&nbsp; Everyone is always spitting.&nbsp; Always!&nbsp; Even in movie theaters!&nbsp; How can that even remotely taste good with a Coke?  So, if you want a completely different movie-going experience, let me take you to a 5:30 matinee at the Ft. Benning Movieplex.&nbsp; After you stumble over Camelbaks, listen to the grumbling about how something "can't be done," and see someone fumbling in the dark for their Skoal can, you'll appreciate your local movie theater a whole lot more.&nbsp; I know I have!

      Last week,  urlLink Ty  asked me what I do in Friday nights.&nbsp;   Well, I'm not one to sit around alone.&nbsp; It's a useful skill that I learned on vicarage at  urlLink Shepherd of the Valley Lutheran Church&nbsp; in San Jose, California.&nbsp; The first few weeks I just sat in my house and watched Friday night television.&nbsp; After I started to hit  Full House  re-runs, I knew it was time to get out.  But I digress.&nbsp; Tonight I saw the movie The Bourne Supremacy.&nbsp; I liked the first one, so I thought I would give this one a try as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad I made it to a matinee and only paid $4.00 to see this piece of junk.  The first did a great job of character development, bringing Jason Bourne from nothing to a checkered past to a realistic and believable hero.&nbsp; This time the flashbacks&nbsp;were all about his first mission and how he get's pulled into the current-day ramifications of that mission so many years ago.&nbsp; Not nearly as powerful as the first one.  Also, in this age of bluescreen, CGI, wire-fighting action, a classic action pic with car chases and human stunts just doesn't quite do it anymore.&nbsp; Not that I am a big fan of all  The Matrix  knock-offs now-a-days, but the 15 minute car chase has run it's course with the  Dukes of Hazard .&nbsp; That, with the wobbly-camera work during action scenes that seems to be common now, almost sent me into an epilectic seizure.  This coupled with the fact that Jason Bourne is a character completely void of a sense of humor, and you have a movie that was hard to stay awake through...literally.&nbsp; If it hadn't been for the explosions, I would have dozed of a dozen times easy.  Unless you get free tickets or need something to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon and can catch a matinee for less that $5, wait to rent it...maybe.

      This is the only time that I care what the frogs have to say about anything.&nbsp; And even then, I don't listen to what they have to say.&nbsp; It's been a bit of a subdued TdF for me this year.  Last year, I was able to watch all the action on the  urlLink Outdoor Life Network .&nbsp; However, the local cable company doesn't carry it and, even if I were at home, it's on a section of cable that we don't get any more.&nbsp; So now I jump over to the  urlLink Cycling News section of Yahoo.com &nbsp;every day at noon, hoping for some news of Lance and his victory.&nbsp; To see Thomas Voeckler in the  mailotte jaune  (Yellow Jersey) for so may days started me to worrying.&nbsp; I kept telling myself "Wait for the alps.&nbsp; Wait for the alps."&nbsp; And that's what I did and that's what he did.  I believe he repeated a feat from last year, catching up with his closest competitor, Ivan Basso.&nbsp; Basso had a two-minute head start, but it wasn't enough to stop Lance.  I have to admit that I admire Lance's life right now.&nbsp; He gets paid to tour around Europe on his bike,  urlLink ride the best equipment that Trek has to offer , and date Sheryl Crow.&nbsp; I'm looking for a downside but I am not seeing it.&nbsp; Well, I guess there was that whole bout with testicular cancer that he had.&nbsp; On second thought, maybe I'm just content to be me.&nbsp; I'd still like his bike, though.

      Today was our first Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) since hitting the ground in May.&nbsp; I wasn't too worried about it because I have been under the wise tutelage of CPT Krieger and he's helped to "pump me up."&nbsp; I was well prepared for anything but I had to sabotage my own self.  Yesterday, our S-4 was promoted to Major.&nbsp; MAJ Adkins celebrated his promotion by taking us to a local eating establishment for some food and drinks and fun.&nbsp; The only problem for me was that I had too much fun.&nbsp; I ended up staying with the group that stayed until midnight...with my PT test at&nbsp;0600, which meant a 0430 wake-up call.&nbsp; It felt like I woke up 30 minutes after I fell asleep.&nbsp; Ugh.  So, being the good trooper than I am, I was there in plenty of time, and I drank three bottles of  urlLink Propel  on my way in, trying anything I could to help me wake up and give me some sort of edge for my test.  To no avail.&nbsp; I passed the test with 43 push-ups, 45 sit-ups and a two-mile time of 15:24, but I know I could have done better if I hadn't messed up last night.&nbsp; Plus, I am still tipping the scales at 250, which is WAY outside Army regs.&nbsp; Oh sure, most people look at me and say "you carry it well," but it doesn't matter.&nbsp; I've still gotta deflate this spare tire around my gut.  And, while I passed the test, I am still not meeting the requirements for Airborne School.&nbsp; Just to get in, I need to be able to do 42 push-ups, 52 sit-ups, and two miles in 15:54.&nbsp; Plus, there is a pull-up requirement which I can't remember right now.&nbsp; While ultimately it was a success, it's definitely not where I need to be.  Ah yes.&nbsp; I remember the good-old-days of college cross-country and track&nbsp;where I was out until at least 2:00 a.m. before a Saturday meet and I still performed pretty well.&nbsp; Could it be that I am getting old?&nbsp; Nah.&nbsp; That can't be it.  The good news is that I am not able to start over at square one.&nbsp; The next test is rumored to be sometime in October, so I'll go back to the drawing board and work my tail off to get better. CPT Krieger will keep me on the weights, I'll get my run schedule set up, throw in some bike rides in the evening and hammer this thing out.&nbsp; Hopefully I can drop a few pounds along the way and get that monkey...err...gorilla off my back.  Oh, and I'll be sure to be home plenty early the night before.

      Okay, after typing out "Command Sergeant Major," I realized that I need to throw up a bit of an acronym glossary.&nbsp; I realize that most people aren't fluent in "armyspeak" so I am going to throw some basics up here to help with future posts.&nbsp; Here are some biggies in no particular order: &nbsp; BN: Battalion (the whole group gathered in our starship [see below]) Starship: the barracks that house the 5 intended Companies of our unit. BC: BN Commander CDR: Commander, ergo BC= BN CDR (Now I'm starting to get the Organic Chem willies!) XO: Executive Officer S-1: Staff Section 1 (Personnel) S-3: Staff Section 3 (Training and Operations) S-4: Staff Section 4 (Supply) CSM: Command Sergeant Major CA: Chaplain Assistant Joe: Another name for recruits.&nbsp; Always collective, much like the use of "Charlie" in Viet Nam. Joethrax: any number of ailments contracted because of one's close proximity to Joe. DS: Drill Sergeant.&nbsp; Sometimes referred to as a "Hat" because of the distinctive Campaign Hat. FTX: Field Training Exercise.&nbsp; An excursion to the field that is usually overnight and sometimes longer. &nbsp; So, here's the quick quiz:&nbsp; Today, the BC got on the S-1 because the CSM couldn't get the men that he needed for a detail.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the S-3 and S-4 argued about who was accountable for the bayonets that Joe lost during the FTX.&nbsp; Top didn't care about that, he was all over the DS's for letting Joe screw up like that. &nbsp; Are you picking up what I'm laying down?&nbsp; Good, because from now on, I'm just gonna stick the shorthand in parentheses behind the word once and you'll have to catch on. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      So, I was so worked up by the movie "I, Robot" that I went to get the book to re-read it...only to find that I hadn't read it at all.&nbsp; So, borrowing a page from my good friend Ann, I have to retract some of the statements of my previous post. &nbsp; I know I read a book by Isaac Asimov about a robot who committed a crime; perhaps it was "Caves of Steel" instead.&nbsp; The movie is still good and somewhat of a "thinker."&nbsp; You should go see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you have come to look to Will Smith as the next Jean Claude Van Dam or Arnold Schwartzenegger.&nbsp; The Command Sergeant Major didn't share my glowing review.&nbsp; He wanted more&nbsp;action and not so much thinking.&nbsp; *shrug*&nbsp; Whatchagonnado?

       Last night I went to a late showing of Will Smith's new movie, "I, Robot."&nbsp; Having read the book in high school, I was skeptical.&nbsp; The book is really a good examination of "logical end" of...well...logic and how it can be manipulated toward an end that may not be desired.&nbsp; While the movie is much more action-packed than the book was, to satisfy a broader audience no doubt, it still deals with the issue of Asimov's book and leaves you wondering about life just a little bit.  For me, it struck a blow at the creeping idol of Logic.&nbsp; It's a movement that is growing more and more prominent and accepted in this Post-Modern Age.&nbsp; It says that, because I can't understand something, it cannot be true.&nbsp; It's a movement that puts the ultimate&nbsp;authority&nbsp;in individual understanding and logical progression.&nbsp; Creativity, faith, hope are things that are not welcome in such a world.&nbsp; Nor are things like skepticism, suspicion, and wonder.&nbsp; In&nbsp;a world ruled&nbsp;by Logic, these things are not welcome or wanted because they are unfounded, unproven, and impossible.&nbsp; If it cannot be proved, then it cannot be possible, which is a statement that sums up most people's concept of God and faith.  I cannot see Him, touch Him, or prove Him, therefore He must not exist.&nbsp; He is not predictable, producable, or prudent, therefore He is not to be trusted.  While I would like to generalize people without faith in this way, it too often applies to people OF faith as well.&nbsp; So many people get upset when God doesn't make sense with their logical expectations.&nbsp; "Why doesn't God do things my way?&nbsp; Doesn't He see how much sense it makes?"&nbsp; Yeah, He probably does, but He's got a plan that goes beyond our logic.&nbsp; His ways are higher than ours.  A long time ago, I figured out that God doesn't make sense; He's not logical.&nbsp; And that has made life so much more fun.

      Well, for a while now, my free blog hosting site has had some free picture possibilities.  Couldn't do much about it while locked in my Army office because this thing works through Instant Messaging, which the military kinda frowns upon.  Security pish-posh or some such.  But, now that I am free from the Iron Firewall, I can post what I want, when I want.    So, what better test message could their be than to send a snapshot of a great day.  It's a picture of me and the two Gregs: Greg Suckow, a good friend since high school and a faithful Hawkeye, and Pastor Greg Fairow, a.k.a. Pastor Hawkeye.  Truly, he is a voice calling out in the wilderness.  You see, Pastor Fairow is the campus pastor for our Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod in Madison.  That's right, everyday he works hard to preach both the Gospel of Christ and the gospel of Herky (is that heresy?) to the lost people of Madison.    The two young ladies are students from the University of Iowa, who have made the trek to Camp Randal Stadium to witness their beloved Hawkeyes crush the head of Bucky yet again.  I wish I could remember their names, but, more importantly, they are Hawkeyes.  That's all you need to know.

      Hallelujah!!  After over TWO MONTHS without too much internet action and very little decent coffee, I have found a place for both.  Click the title to see what has great potential to be my new hangout.  I was tuned into this place by a site called  urlLink FreeWiFiSpot.com .  It's a collection of places throughout the country that offer free wireless internet connectivity.  Some are hotels, some are libraries, there's one at the  urlLink Milwaukee Ale House !  (Ty and I still don't know how we missed that one!)  I happen to be sitting at the Fountain City Coffee House here in "Uptown" Columbus, GA.  I came for the free internet, but I have stayed for the coffee.  Their house blend is pretty dark and a tad bitter for my tastes; it upsets my stomach.  However, the Kona blend that I am sipping now is pretty good. Large coffee is $1.75 with half-price refills. The classic blues song, "It's Not Easy Being Green" by Kermit the Frog/ Jim Henson is playing on the sound system.  Tomorrow night, they have a movie playing at 9:00.  It's one of my all-time faves  urlLink Monty Python and the Holy Grail .  It sounds like they set up a white bed sheet, a computer with DVD player, and a portable projector and watch it outside. Too bad it starts WAY after my bed time, although the coffee would help...NO!  I can't do it.  Interesting musical transition: we've gone from Kermit to the Beastie Boys.  Gotta say I didn't see that one coming.   This is an upscale version of your classic college coffee dive; nice marble tables, matching chairs, clean floors, decorating theme, track lighting, and budding artists with their work on the walls.  We're just down the street from Columbus State University, so there are a few students here, although more than one person has a high and tight haircut like mine.  Although, those have pretty well thinned out by 2000 hours.  Did I mention that they had free wireless internet here?  Oh yeah, you figured that out because I am posting whilst my Kona grows cold.  Gotta slam it down and get home.  I still have work to do for tomorrow...unfortunately.  And Captain Krieger is gonna be waiting for me at 0600.  You will be hearing more from me about this place...trust me!

      It seemed fitting to quote Kurtwood Smith (a.k.a Red Foreman) in his little appreciated role as Clarence Boddicker in the 1987 classic "Robocop" to describe the events of today.  I spent some time out on the range.  No, I wasn't punching cattle, I was out with the Soldiers of A Co. as they familiarized themselves with the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, or SAW.  Definitely packs a whallop; it was fun to see the boys try to engage targets with something this powerful.  Some guys were accurate out to 300 meters or more.  What was even more fun was to see a Chaplain's Assistant try it.  Specialist (SPC) O'Brien is here on her second week of Annual Training (AT).  She's with the 1/334, which is the Reserve unit that I belong to now.  She's done a week over at our Reception Battalion and was wanting to get out and see some "real" training.  I was able to hook her up.  We joined A Co. just as they were finishing their familiarization and were getting ready to fire.  We stood on the firing line as the Soldiers engaged the targets and we policed the lines, seeing how the guys were doing.  As you can guess, spirits were high for a couple of reasons.  First, the big boys were gonna get to fire the big toys.  The Soldiers carry their M16A2's all over the place to get used to being responsible for their weapons.  They were ready to try something a little bigger.  Second, SPC O'Brien is a female, and the first these Soldiers had seen in a while.  It was fun to watch the PVT's get caught looking at the SPC.  When we had finished checking on the boys, I went to find some shade. It was 95 degrees by 1130 this morning.  We found some next to A Co.'s Commander.  As we sat down, he looked at the SPC and said, "How'd you like to fire that weapon?"  SPC O'Brien's usually broad smile got a lot broader as she walked over to an ammo box, drew a strap of 100 belt-fed rounds of 5.56mm and walked to firing point #2, waiting to put rounds down-range.    It was comical to see this maybe 5'2" form get down behind the weapon.  The Drill Sergeant gave her a quick info-brief on how to load the belt and the firing procedures.  She tipped back her borrowed Kevlar, about twice as big as it should have been, scanned down-range for the pop-up targets and let fly with her first five-round burst. The result was a lot of dust and a dropped target at about 75 meters. It's a good thing they were only supposed to shoot 5-7 round bursts because that's about all she could let loose before she had to push her Kevlar back on her head.  The recoil jarred her so much that her huge kevlar fell over her eyes.    In a short while, her rounds were exhausted and all that was left was a lot of brass, some perforated targets, and a great story to share tonight with her bunk mates, who had been stuck pushing paper all day at the Reception Battalion.  Who says being attached to a Chaplain isn't any fun?

      In my new-fangled exercise regimen, Sunday is a day for LSD.  No, not the drug, although it would definitely make me a more interesting preacher.  LSD stands for Long, Slow Distance.  If I were in better running shape, that would mean 4-8 miles.  Since I'm not, that means about an hour to an hour and a half on the bike.  Right now, that's about 20 miles or so.  So, at about 6:30 in the evening, I set out.  Columbus has this neat path called the  urlLink RiverWalk .  I thought to myself, a nice relaxing ride by the river this evening would be just great.  My Trek was all tuned up thanks to the guys at  urlLink Mike's Bikes . I'm getting in shape, right? And besides, how far can this thing run, anyway?  No problem.  So, without any recon or research, I loaded the trusty Trek on my Explorer, and I set out the the trail head that's about 15 mins. from my apartment.    Big problems.  First, the trail wasn't completely finished.  There were actually two small stretches of trail and the main trail.  That meant having to navigate through the downtown area of an unfamiliar city on a bicycle.  Not fun.    Second, the northern part of the trail doesn't go through the best part of town.  As I started, there were calls from some of the locals of "how much does that bike cost?"  Hmmm...this would be a good time to push the pace just a bit.  On the way back, there was a young gentleman on his BMX bike who wanted to race.  Well, kid, if you can catch me on my Trek, I'll be happy to race you but you gotta catch me first.    Third, and I realized this about 10 miles into the ride, the trail is about 15 miles ONE WAY.  For me to go from where I started all the way down to the end at The Fort Benning Infantry Museum, I'm looking at a 30 mile round trip ride, by far my longest this year.  I am proud to say that I made it.  It took me  two and a half hours  but I made it.    Yeah, I know, 30 miles in two and half hours doesn't make me ready for the Tour de France yet, but it did feel good to get that many miles down.  Well, most of me felt good.  The part of me that was touching the saddle all day was REALLY glad when we stopped.  Today's lesson: always do your homework BEFORE you undertake something.

      Well, it's Friday already.  Even the Army doesn't stop when you're away for a bit.  It's been a short week but a catch-up week, so there's been a lot to do.  Last weekend didn’t go quite the way I had planned.  There wasn’t as much time sitting around and I thought because Sara wanted to go places and do things while I was home.  Hey, that’s fine with me…but tiring.  I came back on Tuesday more tired that when I left.  She did such a good job of keeping me busy that I didn’t have any problem sleeping in until 8:00 or 9:00 each morning.  That was all the longer the dogs would allow.  It was great to see all my family at  urlLink St. Paul Lutheran Church .  I was able to preach Saturday night and Sunday morning.  It gave me a couple of great opportunities.  First, I was able to give Pastor Tom a respite.  My heart and prayers go with him a lot.  I was really glad to be able to help out in this little way.  Second, St. Paul kicked off a great ministry that I want to tell you about.  It started with the Soldiers here at Sand Hill.  In my short time here, I have had dozens of requests for Bibles.   urlLink The Gideon’s  are gracious in providing New Testaments, but so many Soldiers are asking for the full Scriptures.  It’s an expense that the Army doesn’t consider as important as others.  But, it’s something that the Church considers important.  When I hit the wall in getting help in the Army, I turned to St. Paul.  I contacted them and told them what I needed.  They took the ball and ran with it.   This past weekend, I explained what we were trying to do to the people of St. Paul.  We launched the “Bibles for Soldiers” program and the people of St. Paul responded very generously.  With what they gave just this past weekend, we’ll be able to buy 1,000 Bibles from the  urlLink International Bible Society , and I’m sure that more will be coming after that.  For now, these Bibles will be made available to the Soldiers who are doing their initial training here. Anyone who wants a Bible will be given one.  It’s seems the least that we can do, to make sure that young men who are volunteering to serve their country have a simple Bible to read and draw strength from.  It’s heartening to see the Church rise to this challenge.

      I was reminded this afternoon why I love to live in Wisconsin near Lake Michigan.  After a quick movie ( urlLink Hart's War ), I decided that I didn't want to sit around too much during my four-day pass.  So, we packed up the dogs and headed to  urlLink Kohler-Andrae State Park , which is our new water destination for the dogs because the dog beach that used to be on the south side of Sheboygan has been gobbled up by the  urlLink Blue Harbor Resort .  It's not too much of a hassle, just that State Parks have a leash law, which we conveniently disregard for the most part.  As we pull up, there's a light drizzle in the air.  Sara doesn't mind, I don't mind, and we know that Boomer and Trinity don't mind because they're wanting to get into the lake!  We climb the sand dunes to get over to the lake and as we crest the top of dune, it was just stunning.  There were rain clouds over the lake and we could see the sheets of rain falling miles and miles away.  The grey-blue of the sky mingled and mixed with the slate-blue of rain falling on the greenish-blue of the lake.  The tide was rolling, as much as it does in this part of Wisconsin, so there were crashing waves at regular intervals.  A few hundred meters offshore was a sailboat at full sail was pushed northward at a good speed.  Closer by, Trinity was looking up at me with her soulful brown eyes, with just one word hidden deep inside them: "Throw."  The landscape would have to wait; my daughter wanted to play fetch.  It seemed like a hundred times that I threw that neon green and fuscia disc into the greenish-blue sea. And every time, Trinity was more eager to fetch than I was to throw.  Nevermind the fact that sometimes she was so eager that she didn't even see where it had gone, which made me wish that I had not worn denim shorts.  I don't know if it's genetic disposition, the ability to play, or a desire to see me happy and cheer her on that makes her crash through the surf each time to get that frisbee.  Frankly, I don't care because each time we go it's almost as if she's skipping through the waves and having the time of her life.  To see her be so diligent in her play makes me want to be more diligent in mine.  It's times like these that she's a real inspiration to me.  It's times like these that I miss her the most.    Boomer wants nothing to do with fetching; it's beneath him.  He's an explorer.  He loves to claim and mark new territory for the Vanderbilt clan.  Of course. when the next good rain or tomorrow's dog comes around, his claims will be no more.  Nevertheless, he wanders around the beach looking for another tuft of grass to hold his mark.  He bring Sara in tow as they conquer new worlds for his race.  It's one small leak for a dog; one big downpour for canine kind.  The landscape keeps drawing me back.  I notice that the sailboat has scooted away and I can't see it anymore.  I get so lost in the melding of the rainclouds and the lake that I jump when Trinity steps on my foot wanting another throw.  Called away from admiring the mural that God has painted over the water today, I turn back to task at hand: making my daughter happy.  My mind drifts to a time in the not-so-distant future when my children will join us.  Maybe throwing the balls and frisbees for these of future dogs to fetch.  Maybe content to make sandcastles where princesses are held under the control of evil dragons, waiting for their prince to come.  But, there's no time to wonder about the children of the future; my daughter is back for another flip.  As I watch her bound out over the waves and marvel as she "surfs" them back in, I realize that today may have been the most beautiful day in my entire life and I will cherish it forever.

      Strains of Motley Crue are ringing in my ears: "Tonight!  Tonight! I'm on my way!  I'm on my waaaaay.  HOME SWEET HOME!"  At least I think that was Motley Crue.  It was some Hair Band that I listened to before I had any sense of taste.  Whoever it was, the message is still the same.  After almost 2 whole months, I'm going home to see my lovely wife, Sara, and the "dynamic duo," Boomer and Trinity.  I can't wait!  I've got a rough outline of what the weekend is going to look like.  Tonight, I'm just going to sit on my porch, drink some wine, and watch the world go by.  Then it'll be off to bed with my wife and 150 lbs. or Labrador Retrievers.    Tomorrow, I'm sure I'll be up by 0600 (old habits die hard) and I'll put in a few miles running.  Come, home, make some coffee and sit on my porch as I watch the world go by, waiting for my wife to wake up.  We'll quick pop into the  urlLink church   real quick so I can see the wonderful women that hold that place together and then it's an afternoon with the puppies, wearing them out.  Dinner Friday night will be at  urlLink Cucina , as Sara and I celebrate our 7th wedding anniversary that was Monday.  We'll come home, open some wine, sit on the porch and watch the world go by.  Saturday, I'm preaching at St. Paul, trying to give Tom a break, and then we're having dinner with some good friends, Roger and Wendy, that evening.  It'll all wrap up with some wine on the porch.  Sunday will be church all morning, lazing around all afternoon, fireworks that night, and some wine on the porch.  Monday is gonna be spent in Cedarburg with  urlLink Bryan and Zachary , and if Ty and Denys, want to tag along as well, who am I to say "no"?  I fly back that night and I'm back 0600 for PT on Tuesday.  Already, I can see that the weekend is going to be too short, but aren't they always?  I'm just glad to be heading home.
