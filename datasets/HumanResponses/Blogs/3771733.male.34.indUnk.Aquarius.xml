      Here's the deal:  If anyone sees this god awful blog and wants to leave a comment, please provide:  1. a first name; 2. an occupation;  3. an annoying habit; and  I will craft a curse for you to use exclusively in relation to the person described.  If no comments are left in the next few days, I will just go ahead and dream up some general curses myself.  OK, here's another strange curse  urlLink link , this time its for a shareware program to protect you against curses and black magic.  Honestly, some people have too much spare time.

      Thanx Gladys for the granting of my 15 nanoseconds of fame.  Thinking of a curse to stamp into the pages of my collection of ratty old secondhand books, to stop people not returning them.  Here goes:  "Should you not return this book, may your fingers become more entangled than the innards of a PC built by my younger brother, rendering you never able to turn the pages of any borrowed book again."  Cheap custom rubber self-inking stamp company, here I come!  OK, maybe that was an overstatement and my curse needs some work.  Not to mention the fact that I rarely lend out my books.

      Like a marooned mariner, I have drifted haplessly to the shore of this island that is my blog.  What bollocks, but heh, I'm only on day 2.  Curses update:  I don't know about the legality of this, but here is a  urlLink link  I found to be quite amusing.  It basically describes the practice of placing curses in library books to ensure the book's return.  I think I will institute this practice at home, maybe even get a stamp made up to save time.

      Good evening and how are you?  Like most people, I want my 15 nanoseconds of fame, unfortunately you have stumbled across this site and my wish has become a pathetic reality.  Just had an idea, since I'm calling this site "Hex on Lex", I shall use it to collate hexes, curses and the like from around the internet.  By "the like" I mean the usual drivel most gen xer's obsess about.  Nice.  A hobby is just what I don't need.  Feel free to deride me and this blog, I could do with the material for my collection.  ALX

      ...a curse shall be developed to put on every single person using the internet, except those whom I exempt.  Scared?  I bet you are.  By "bet" I mean about $4.00.  Curse to follow in next post.  Meanwhile, a  urlLink link  relating to a hex on an ex-lover.  Tres weird.
