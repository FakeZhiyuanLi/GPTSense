      had a very bad saturday.. ate a dumplin in the&nbsp; morning for breakfast then started to have a bit of stomach pain.. but later went to meet a gal.. then go friend b'dae.. before that we went wild wild wet.. had much fun but was having stomach pains all the while.. so terrible..then later around 6pm.. couln't stand it anymore then decided to go sit a taxi to go home.. when i left the taxi,i walk a few steps then vomited all the dumpling out. so i thought is indigestion.. so i went home and slept from around 6.30pm to 12+am.. then woke up to go toilet.. then i felt very dizzy and i actually FAINTED... i was layin on the floor juz outside the kitchen and luckily.. i think is after awhile i woke up.. luckily i did not hit my head on anything.. but i think i hit my wrist on something cuz it still hurts until now.. ouch.. then drank milo.. then vomit it out... had such a bad headache.. so i decided to go back to sleep.. then the next day, i went doctor with my mum and the doctor said i have food poisonin and dehydration and fever.. three things at one go.. haiz.. my stomach was so weak.. didn't have strength to carry anything at all.. so i slept the whole day on sun.. and on monday, i felt a little better but i did not go to school..as had a mc and was still weak.. and finally on tuesday i went back to sch.. on the morning, i fely quite ill still.. but after one or two hours later.. i felt my sickness was all gone except for my stomach not havin enough strength even though u all may not see it.. that's y i like sch, my class and my friends who cheered me up and make me laugh.. and that made me well again.. THX!!

      Haiz...today is a damn boring day... got mock exam until 11.30....but actually lots of people cheated as there were no teachers in the class...for 4na today,we had two papers unlike the other classes which only had one...that's so unfair!!we had english which ends at9.40 and accounts which start at 10 and end at 11.30...it all started at 8...so damn tired...mock exam not fun... real exam is more fun...since there was a break for abt 20mins, i decided to walk pam and kim home..even though i stopped halfway as i was afraid to be late..and so i went back to school and talked to elicia a while..then saw Nuriko comin our way... but she was so quiet as usual... why can't she be like how she was in primary sch and sec 1-2...she like keep avoidin me.. not fair..like i will eat her up like that.. and i don't even like her anymore... juz wanna be like old times...at least she talked to me in the past... oh well.. tat's all for now... bye all...
