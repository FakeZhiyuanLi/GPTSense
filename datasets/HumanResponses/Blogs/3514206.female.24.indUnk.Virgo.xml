      Ok so Mother freakin Nature is picking on me!!!! My husband  DAMNED   God  on our camping trip over the weekend (you can read about it here http://www.stopplatetectonics.net/blogs/rdurkin/)and well nothing went  right  after that! Robyn pretty much covered most the details of our camping trip so I won't rewrite about it but i will say that i was completely  FREAKED  OUT! We did have fun though and " FUCK IT WE'RE CAMPING !!!" LOL  We come home from our camping trip all worried about our basement being flooded and our cat being flipped out, but everything was fine up until the next night! I mean DAMN can I get just one night this week where I'm not thinking that I am going to have to go get in the crawl space of my house, in fear of my life being takin by a damn tornado (I don't live in KANSAS and my name ain't Dorothy!) geez!  We prepare all nice and calm like, put both Bizkit and Gravie (our kitty's) in the bathroom just in case we have to grab them real quick, no chasing involved! We get a pathway to our crawl space and i have the phone and a flash light in my hand...all to do now is freak out and wait! AHHHH  Mark puts his car out of the garage to wait for it to hopefully hail on it and i stand on the deck looking up at the sky freezing because within seconds it got cold! So I'm  outside  watching for funnel clouds (where i shouldn't be), then inside watching the weather man tell me that  i should take shelter , then outside to watch for funnel clouds and so on! Well on my trip in from watching for funnel clouds outside; I'm going toward the T.V. I heard Mark yell from upstairs " TORNADO !!!!" I'm like  HOLY SHIT ! and start truckin upstairs (where they tell you not go) to see it and I look outside from our bedroom window (where they tell you to get away from) and it's all brown and ugly and behind it it's pitch black and really MEAN looking! The wind had stopped and it was only raining a real little bit....(They say that is when it happens) and I just knew this is it! The funnel cloud was swirling...like when you put creamer in coffee and about that color! Then it comes to me:  "uh, upstairs is NOT where we need to be right now!!!" but we couldn't stop looking at it. It was the first time for both of us to see something like that! My heart was beating 90 miles a minute and could have peed on myself right then and there. But instead i went and watched it OUTSIDE!!! Now that i am writing about it we sure are stupid! LOL Anyway this is the closest that i have been to a tornado and it was flippin CRAZY! If you have ever been a tornado and didn't shit on yourself you are a better person than me!!! LOL
