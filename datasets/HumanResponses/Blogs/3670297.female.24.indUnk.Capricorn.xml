      I got up late today, probably around ten am.  I spent my whole day doing laundry and organizing things until I went to work today.        Isn't it funny how when you say your going to do it, then you never end up doing it.  But when you dont say it,even plan or think it in your head, you automatically do it.  Wow!  Life is amazing, always surprizes.       Today at work was busy, as soon as I got up checking my 3rd customer already got my bad side.  She thought I was ripping her off on her meat and all on her other groceries.  Then when I explained to her like four times she was wrong, shen just took off and said I have no time for this I'll come back and get it tomorrow.  Then she left me all that crap to take care of.  Sometimes people are just weird!        I just got off work hour ago, now here I am again same spot, same time and same rhyme.        Oh! I havent talked to you guys about my hair today, well everytime Im out in public I feel like people are making fun of my hair, specially when I am at work I sort of regret my hair now.  This is the shortest I ever done  my hair.  I just hope I dont get hit on by the lesbians here in seattle cause it looks like a dykes hair cut.  I am not being mean to anyone but thats my opinion.  And you know whats worse, I dont have a tan any more  I dont even feel like I am from hawaii anymore cause I have no color, just light pale run down brown water color.  Ahhhhh!      well im getting tired, have a good night everyone.                 Love, Mina

      Hello everyone, Sorry for the past couple of nights I already forgot about my blog.  Shame on Mina!  Ookay so today jerm and I woke up late, very late around 10am then jerm and I took a nice long cold shower and then we were off to neverland. We have encountered another cool part of seattle, it was a little suburb called "Wallingford" It was cool, kind of dead reminds me of a little boston and half mineapolis if you guys have ever been there???  Anyways so we had lunch at this sushi, noodle house place, great food, but bad service cause jerm said so.  Our waitress was kind of kranky cause I believe it was too early of a shift for her. Hahahha! Good one.  Anyways, then after our bad service lunch, we walked around wallingford and got some chocolate filled bread, and it was good.  then they had weird stuff around the streets so we went and checked them out.  Afterwards, we left because I had to work at 3pm at CRAPway. Nope! sorry guys no new job yet, hopefully soon.  So I took the car to work tonight cause jerm was to tired to take me and I needed the car so I could go see my other sidetap anyways.:)Hahahah! Gotcha again, man I am too damn funny.! Oh yah so I only worked for four hours tonight and it was great, it was busy and wow my co-workers actually talked to me today just about anything.  That is a first, I miss all you air wisconsiners, I would rather be working with you guys.  Anyways, enough of that before someone gets tearyeyed:(  Then after work, jerm and I had dinner and the movies like every other couple here in Seattle Washington.  So we watch the "RIDDICK" tonight and it was okay for me and for jerm is was oka.Get it? me okay and jerm oka....Hahaha!cause jerm never really wanted to see it, but it was fun and cool and VIN DIESEL is such a HUNK.  YuP! Sorry Dar, I have to tell you. Vin and I been together since DAY 1 and he only loves me.:)  Haha! Anyways so its fun go watch it.  Man, see when you dont own a tv and havent seen cable for almost two years, your money ends up in the movies.  This is our 2nd movie this week.  Were on a roll.  Okay you know how I been saying I am cutting my hair, well it havent happened yet but it will tomorrow, I already made appointment so you guys better watch out fo the new Mina.  Anyways it saturday, you guys must think we are a boring couple cause we dont club or do anything else than movies, we I'll to be honest with you.  We are! Well Im entertaining and so is jerm, well not as good as me though.                So this weekend is gay pride week and I dont know if all y'all got it in your little town, but yah! tomorrrow is the big gay parade couple blocks from my house and its fun and interesting if you like to people watch and just be in a croud of different people.  I have total respect for gay people, they are humans just like us we are all the same, we are just different type of personality. thats a damn shame people who are just like them treat them like there aliens.  Anyways, they had the DIKE parade today, they walked around capitol hill with drums and sang, it was fun.  Seattle is an awesome place.  Man, since I lived here I almost seen all the licence plate from all the states maybe only 10 I havent seen but everyone moves here and I think its funny.                  Well Jeremy says Hello everyone, poor guy he's been having bad dreams lately, he would sleep walk all the time and then he cant go back to bed, poor thing hopefully he sleeps good tonight.  Yah, so I dont know if all y'all know that he has a great job, he likes it alot and he loves the pay the best.  He is an awesome guy, he is the best.  Okay, well I think that is it tonight, sorry guys I know you guys love reading all this fun stuff I put out, but this superstar gotta get its beauty sleep too you know.:) Hahahah.                 Okay love and aloha's                      Aloha o', you stink like poi              nah, Mina

      Alooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! hey everyone, how are things?  Well as for me  I had a very eventful, fun day. I got up early, around 630am cause i had to move the car, it was park at the no parking 7-9am parking, dont want that bad boy to get towed again. Hah! Then I told myself that was too early, so i went back to bed then I got up at 8am.  I had a banana, took a shower then I worked on some things.  I cleaned up my place then work on some clothes and art for my apartment.  The weather was kind of cold and cloudy today in seattle.  Then I left the house around noon to pick up jerm, he is back now, Yeh!  He said Hallo! drove down to federal way, yah! isn't that funny there is a federal way here like how theres one in Denver.Hah! Picked him up at work, then we drove out to renton had lunch at teriyaki place and then we went to the movies.  we watch TERMINAL, the one with tom hanks in it!  It was great, i recommend you guys seeing it.  That's all there is for me here in seattle, (MOVIES)I have no television beacuse I promised myself that I should not watch any tv while im in school, its just distraction from working on homeworks.  Sorry my blog is no fun tonight guys.  Anyways so after the movie, we, I mean I ate again and we head back home.  Nothing much exciting today besides jeremy being back, yeh.   Well i hope everyone is enjoy my weblog.  Have a good night.                            Love and Aloha's                              Mina

      Heeeeeeeeellllllllllllloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Howzit, everyone! Man, I feel like im on a talkshow, comming out to the audience, hello! welcome welcome today we are going to have a great show! Nah, okay back to the real business.         Okay I got up a little late today cause I stayed up late last night till 3am, so I got up around 930am.  I did my usual thing in the morning, you know stretch,scratch,slap,spankink it to the left then right then rub it down.LOL! Hahaha, good one.  Yah so today I didn't get out much, I mean I didn't get out of the house till I had to go to my job.  So I stayed home, it wasnt that hot at all today anyway I work on some sewing, just making art or crap on my wall.  I love to hang stuff up even if its just stuff.  Man I dont think I did anything today, well just those ones.  Okay so I went to work at 5pm and my boss was there.     She warned me being late couple of days ago, because lately with finals and all I came in late atleast four times.  She came to me and said,  "you know what missy! Im gonna have to write you up, becuase you been coming in late lately and I told her yah, sure thats okay.  Then she told me its not hawaiian time here if it's 1pm its 1pm."       When she told me about writting me up, it was cool but when she said it's not hawaiian time it kind of buged me!  Do you guys understand where I am coming from?.  Man I thought to myself, man you dont say that shit, thats fucking rude, your boss should never ever ever bring stuff like that especially if you take it serious.  Then I went to the damn check stand and I was cussin like a fucking sailor, I was talking to myself in my mind.  Damn! That White bitch, who the fuck does she think she is saying that shit.  What a bitch!!! I dont know about you guys but I thought that was fucked up she said that, fuckin Haole!           Anyways, about my job today she was there and she said "Oh good job in comming in early" So I told her yah! then whispered. Bitch! Sorry guys I know its rated R tonight.  Anyways so it was kind of a quick night, it was busy and it went smoothly.  NO troubles,and nothing fun or interesting happened.  So I just got home not to long ago and I just ate, now here i am on my talkshow.  Telling you guys crap, I wonder how many of you read all this crap anyways?  Well let me know how I am doing so far.  So what movie have you guys seen lately?  Well Jerm and I saw (DODGEBALL) couple of days ago and it was hilarious, so you guys gotta go see it.  Ben stiller is awesome, he does such a good job.  Anyways, Well I guess I dont got much to talk about tonight, so I will be back same time, same rhyme tomorrow night.        Okay good night from Downtown Seattle, Have a good night everyone!  LOTS LOVE AND ALOHAZ ALWAYS,                Mina

      Hello everyone, How are you all doing?  Well for me right now, I am really bored.  Anyways so today I actually got up before jerm, then I went back to bed. Haha!  so I got up around 8am took cold shower, because lately Seattle been really hot lately, past couple of days its been 82 degrees and sweaty!  Yah, its great.  Makes me feel like im back home, but not really cause the beach here stinks and cold.  Anyways, continueing on then we went to the post office to mail some gifts for my lovely family, then we had lunch at one of our favorites.  TOFOO!  awesome place, then i had to drop jeremy off to work, he is not here tonight with me for the next couple of days :( cause he is at a confrence thing some where out in BFE. Have fun jerm!  He said Hi, Hello and Aloha's to everyone. Then after I drop his fat ass off, I drove downtown to pick up one of my friends, hah! more like my only friend! We hung out at her place till decided what to do for couple of four hours till she heads to work.  Just when we were walking out one of our male friend showed up, so we went to Dick's.  (Okay, get your mind out of the gutter, Dicks is a very famous burger joint here in Seattle, really good cheap burgers) They got the best milkshilks eveeeeer!  yah after wards we drove across/over the water because jose never been to Alki beach.  Remember Alki, me and jerm were just there yester? Yah that one.  Walk around, skip rocks most of the time, well we tried playing frizzby but jose keep on hitting these old ladies on there legs so for the fourth time we gave up. We did not want to injure anyone, so I skateboard while they skip rock then the rest of our alki day were skipping rocks.  Yup!  You know I'm good when it comes to skipping rocks, yup, the most i do is six.  What! can you beat Me?:) Then we head back to downtown, drop off jose.  He is going home to Yakima (Yuk-IMa) Then Pui (thats my only friend) and I went to Jumba juice Mmmm.. we got drinks then I drop her off to work.  So after that I was all alone.:(All by myselffff...,dont wanna be all by myself) So I got home around 6pm.  Find a damn paking, cause here is so tight and damn those hills, thats the worst oh NO! thats not the worst, can you say PARALLEL PARKING! yup thats the worst, but you know what my motto about that is "I dont care I got a colorado plates" Hahaha, get it! so i wont look stupid cause they'll think i just moved here. Hahahah! Man i got alot to say tonight.  Okay, guys and gals I am sorry if my grammar are terrible, I still havent taken english class yet and that is one of my worse subject so i will be taken it that quarter I graduate.  so too bad so sad, for now you guys have to deal with it.  Just think of me talking to you, cause I do write the way I talk.  Okay so when I got home I went online for a little while and check if I got any comments on my weblog, and thank you Kathy for that nice gesture and I miss you too.  Then I walked up the street to buy me some snacks, then head to pagliazy? a pizza place to buys some pizza, then I got back home, made some clothes pattern and by tomorrow I should have it sewn up.  Just a cute skirt that goes with a top:) Eh!  Its 11:35pm now and I believe I will be up all night cause I dont usually go to bed till around 130 or 200.  Well I hope you enjoyed this one.  Everyone take care and much Mahalo's for being part of my life.  Oh! Yah, it's my summer break I have till july 12 so if anyone wants to come visit me and get a free tour give me a halla!                      Good Night everyone,

      Okay so I woke up late today around 10:30 i guess, but hey its okay because its my summer break.  Anyways, i went to work at two pm for about four hours, and it was okay.  kind of slow, but eh! I'm starting to hate my job.  I need to move on and get a new and better job.  Yah, SAFEWAY sucks.  I like the people, but i dont not as much as i loved air WIZ people.  Air Wisconsin was and is still is right now the bet job I ever had in my 24 years old of life.  Yah, I miss you guys.!  Anyways so after four hours of hard work at CRAPway, Jeramy and I went to the Fremont fair.  Jerm, thought it would be over by nine o'clock pm tonight but when we got there around 6-630 or maybe seven, everyone was closing down, so the only vendor that we could it at is corn.  MMMM.. tasty!  yah then we head off to bajah fresh, then to stone cold ice cream?? NO i think its cold stone, i dont know it had a stone and cold word in it.  So after words we walked back to the car while eating our melting icecreams, and bumms asking us for change.  So after that we head out to west seattle, its one of the famous hang out places for people who love to show off their cars ans all they want to do is hit on young woman, and the girls get all the attention dressing up hootchie.  Oh Well! That's only my opinion.  anyways it was called the Alki beach, tons of people there every weekend.  we walked around till the sunseted! then i got cold, cause you know me when its 75 degress its cold to me.  So that was about 2 hours ago, now we are home, jerm is sitting over there reading his nerdy magazines and me sitting my ass on this uncomfortable stool that we bought for three dollars at a garage sale.  Oh! NO! your thinking we have become seattle people. So tomorrow I am getting a new hair du and its gonna rock.  I promise i will send pictures.  okay its about 10:41pm and Im gonna work on other projects now, I will continue for the rest of my life.  Take care everyone.            HAPPY FATHERS DAYS TO ALL DADS AND TAYS OUT THERE.:)

      I got up late today again as usual and jerm worked till four.  So I feel really guilty today, because I haven't done skwat!  I mean, I had breakfast then I was on the internet for a very long time working on this and my other websites.  I feel guilty is because I am suppose to be sewing and making more stuff but no not today, I dont know why.  But the satisfaction about my day is that when jerm got home he and I went to one of the apartments I had appointment with and it turned out great.  She gave us a tour it was really cool apartments and its all the way on the 13th floor.  I was really excited so hopefully my cousins credit and my credit are good so we get this cool apartment.  It is right in downtown, just take your skateboard down the hill and your there.  It had an awesome view.  So please everyone cross your fingers for us to get this cool apartment.  Its was cheap too for two bedrooms, its $1,040.00 and well not really that doesnt include the bills, but its our budget so its all good.  so anyways, those two pic of me yup thas the new MINA, yeah it's a cool hair cut but I am still not pretty.  Just same ol'mina.  Oh so that was the best part of the day finding the perfect apartment, for me and the guys.  Anyways I actually finished my projects I had going tonight so I was happy about that.  Oh, if you guys are wondering about jerm, he is doing just fine yes his fatter, but thats what I love about him, his sexy that way.  He has a great job and he is happy.  He says hi and misses you guys too.  Anyways I hope everything is going well for everyone.   Take good care, lots of Aloha's and Mahalo's                     Mina

       Yo Yo! Hey everyone.  I had my writing class today, I am kind of upset because the class was too short.  I pay so much money, for this school, and the teacher lets everyone out early.

Anyways, so everyone please wish me luck, I will do better.  I know I will do better and I am going to be myself.            I know it's late, I should be in bed, but I can't sleep that's why I am doing this and plus I am thinking too much about my presentation.  Okay, now I am good to go.

         Man, what a day! So today, I actually got up early to do stuffs. What a great day, jerm and I had. So I went to work around 11:30am to meet a friend she was going to show me how to create a bouquet of flowers I already know how too but I needed to make sure I am doing it right because, remember my presentation on tuesday, I am going to show how to create a bouquet of flowers. Well anyways,we actually hung out with Bonnie     Pierce today, you guys should remember her. She just got back from Denver couple of weeks ago and she said she saw most of everyone. But, she invited us out to play some softball with her co-workers. It was fun. One of my goals for life is to join a softball league, but I haven't been searching   lately cause I have school. Next year I will be graduating, so maybe after all that I will be in a league.  cross your fingers for me. Also, there are more I want to take up, beause I always wanted to do all these fun things three years ago or even longer, but I   been putting it off.                     Anyways, so it was a great day. We played softball, there were only three women thats including me, so we played three to three. Jerm,Adam and I were in one team. Then everyone in three's; I thought I did good, but when I got up to bat and pitch I sucked. I guess I was to   nervous, because I didn't know everyone. Oh' yah, jerm threw a ball at me and hit me on my ankle, now it's all bruised up. Damn jerm! Anyways, then we left around 3pm, beacause I had to work at six,and jerm had to get his hair cut, so we went to a cool shop, and his barber was pretty funny, DIKES!              When I arrived at work today, I was doing okay mind wise I mean, then when I started checking I was so nervous, I didn't know why. But I think it's beause it was so busy, it was to over whelming for me you know. Yah, all night was busy and it's sunday alot of drunks as usual coming in for more beer. Oh' yah and they had the sea fair this weekend, today was the last day. If you guys don't know what the sea fair is, it is      on the water, they have tug boats race,and bunch of rich people drive there boat out at  lake washington park, Oh yah, and don't forget the most important of course. "THE BLUE ANGELS" Yah, damn those planes making all that rackit like eight in the morning waking my ass up. Anyways,     so that was the deal for today, I am really tired. I woke up too early and I played softball and busy work. But's it's all good. Okay ladies and Gents.     Have a good night. and keep in touch please.     oh'yah!  HI GREG MCKAY, THANK YOU FOR BEING A FAAN OF MY BLOG. I LOVE YA, YOUR ONE OF MY INSPIRATION.       MAHALO'S       MINA

        Okay, my teeth hurt like a mother.  I mean, okay so this morning, I had my dentist apointment today and all I got was both on the top at the very end(wisdom teeth)     I guess what they call it.  I got those two yanked out.  I was bleeding all day, Im a little better now, but it's back it hurts and I got a big ass headache.  Yah, so I waisted my day sleeping cause it hurted so bad and they are one selfish dentist, they only gave me two ibefrophen.  What is that about.  Anyways, it hurts Im going to bed.                      Aloha's                                 Mina

        So I have officially decided to make my every sundays be my relax day. From now on, at this very sunday, it will be nothing but sleeping in. OOohh Yahh! So I slept in today, and I got up at 1030am. I watch my chick flick then at 1pm I headed out to work. I was cranky before I went to work, so my first hour of my shift was bad. I was dizzy, and I couldn't stand up cause I dont know. Then this stupid old white lady, she was cranky her self. She gave me shit because she had hard time getting money out. So after she left, I told myself, I hope she crokes on the biscuits she bought and someone would hit her on the road, then I felt better. See, I know each and one of you felt that way before, but when we say those things, you know its now true. You just say it because your so upset at someone blaming you for no reason. That's why that was harsh. Anyways, the day got better, I worked till 8pm, so I just got off work not to long ago.          I called up jamal today, most of you should know him. From ZW, he is doing good, graduated from college last friday, he is still at ZW, and he is doing really good. Jamal, is so cool, and girls he's available still. If I was single I would ask him out for lunch. He soo cute. Okay, yah dont worry jerm is right here. Anyways, I gotta go eat now. Im having hog for dinner, mmmmmmmmmm...     Good night and wish me luck on my Dentist apointment tomorrow, I will have two of my wisdom teeth pulled out.      Mahalo and Aloha     Love you guys,     Mina
