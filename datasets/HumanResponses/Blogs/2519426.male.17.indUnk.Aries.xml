      Last night, at Emily's party, we counted down the seconds until there was 24 hours left until the real thing! Yay!! It was really fun, but I don't think I can top Ryan's list.... The food was great, friends were great, music was OK, duel was great (I beat Zach w/o Relinquished or my Tornado Wall), but I couldn't throw that golf ball worth beans (sorry everyone)!   I think I'll go to bed tonight real early-like... this year I feel like ringing in the New Year in bed, asleep. Oh! and I beat MoH: Rising Sun, but I have yet to unlock all the special features and whatnot.   I'm still wondering why Becky wasn't invited to Emily's party... I mean, why would John be invited, but not his girlfriend? Seems weird to me....  Ummm... right. Bye!

      The day flew by like... a bird... or something.  Or maybe Superman... yeah, Superman.  But anywho, I had a good day.  (Insert interesting things here.)  Ryan came over tonight and we played a little MoH and Soul Calibur.  And that's about it.  I guess winter break hasn't been too friendly to my blog.  Oh well!  Bye!

      I almost forgot to post something for today... lets see....  Not much really to say today, besides the fact that I beat 5 more level in Rising Sun and that some action has finally come upon Emily's blog.  Lol!  If you haven't seen it yet, you should click on the link over there >> and check it out!  That's about it.  Maybe I'll have a longer post sometime soon.  See ya!

      I just got MoH: Rising Sun today for Xbox (thanks for the advice guys), although my Xbox doesn't seem to like it very much.  I took it to George's house and it froze twice in Co-op mode.  We still had a fun time, though.  Oh yeah!  I got the soundtrack for Chicago while at the mall today and I converted Mister Cellophane to mp3 format on my computer.  Angelfire's being homosexual, so I can't post it here yet... maybe sometime soon.

      Christmas dinner was great.  My mom's apple pie was awesome *drools*... I can feel the pounds adding up.  I'll leave the rest to your imagination.   Going to the mall tomorrow real early-like.  Gonna use some of those gift certificates and spend other kinds of money as well.  I'm not sure, though, whether I should get a new game or more clothes.  Any suggestions?   Well, I'll leave you to your fun family get-togethers (yeah right!) and your festive holiday dinners and eventual holiday leftovers.  See ya!

      Got some gifts, went to my grandmom's, had a good time overall.  Let's see... I got plenty of clothes, a couple of gift certificates, some Simpsons stuff (thanks to Ryan, Joe, Harry, and Cait), a few things for my room, and other small things as well.   I picked out a nice little song for my audition for the spring play... it's Mister Cellophane from the Chicago sountrack (don't steal it!)  I'll post an mp3 up here soon.  That's all I got for today... Merry Christmas!

      Well, I think I'm the first to admit that it doesn't really seem like Christmas Eve.  I think I'm going to stay up late enough to catch my dad... er... Santa leaving presents under the tree.  Ummm... not much else to post.  I have a strange feeling that the break will be rather boring; it was even a struggle to get through today!  At least I can wake up tomorrow and have something to do...  Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Krazy Kwanzaa, Tip-Top Tet, and a Solemn and Dignified Gnesh!

      I beat Harry today in a duel!  HARRY!  But to be fair, he beat me in another duel, so we called the match a draw.  Exchanging Christmas gifts in school was great.  It seems everyone got something cool, and I made out with a nice deck holder and several new cards to add.  I would like to take this webspace to thank everyone who gave me something (esp. Ryan - I love the pins and the double-purpose thing is working for me) and to inform everyone for whom I got gifts that I kept all of the receipts (lol).  I'm going to do the regular segment today, but for the rest of the holiday break, I won't go to the trouble of posting links and all that stuff.

      Ugh... the highlight of my day was JCL, or maybe 4th block (even though I lost twice to Zach).  Congrats to John for coming up with such a cool title... check it out on the right.  Let's see, the band party was alright... compared to getting your intestines ripped out by ravinous wolves.  No kidding, it was one of the worst after-school parties I have ever attended.  Try some real music for once!  But anywho, John and I had some fun, so it turned out alright in the end.  I'm kind of too tired to do the regular segmentiola, but here it goes...

      Just got home, well, like an hour ago, after going caroling at Genesis (guess I was going today anyway) and having some lunch/dinner at Friendly's.  Food was good, conversation was interesting.  Also, it looks like John took my advice, check the new page at the right... My sister'll have to help him get some comments on there, and I can help him will some other stuff too.  I thought by the conversation Harry and I had at Friendly's I had figured out who "The Morning" is, but Harry confused me again with a statement he made before we left.  Can anyone with information please tell me the identity of this unknown love interest?  That would help out a lot...  Right now, I'm listening to a little 3 Doors Down... I thought I could put a few favorite mp3's on here, but I think that would be illegal or something (stupid government).  Have I done a quote of the day yet?  I guess not...  The Various Homestar Runner Character Quote of the Day!!!   urlLink Hey, stupid. I bought you this stuff!   Feels like I'm doing this a lot for Christmas... but I guess that's it for now.

      Didn't go to Genesis today because both my mom and sister aren't feeling too well and I am supposed to look after them.  I made the Homsar links come up in a new window so that if you click on them, you don't have to click Back to come back to my page.  Ummmm... did I mention I'm bored?  Everyone has these book-reports (or so it seems) and I'm left posting on my blog about nothing!  Oh! I should get started on making those study-cards for the vocab words.  See ya later!

      Added Joe's page, you can check it out if you like reading friggin novels (j/k Joe) and Zach's page (which I just found out existed).  I also tweaked the template just a little bit to make a few changes, and I added a new section of links that I feel contribute overall to the World Wide Web.  Enjoi!

      My family went shopping and I got a few last-minute gifts... had to exchange some gifts for bigger sizes... like Ryan, this is probably the first year I've actually gone around giving out gifts to friends.  It feels good inside to buy things for other people, but my wallet's screaming with pain.  I should have another paycheck soon, though.  Then she'll be happy...  Today was my mom's birthday as well!  I got her something really nice, and I know she loved it.  We have to leave the house again (ugh!) tonight to go to my grandmom's house for dinner.   Time for the regular segment!!  The Homsar Quote of the Day!!!   urlLink When can we start the Jefferson's?   I probably should start mixing it up with quotes from other members of the Homestarrunner Crew.   My parents are really getting on my nerves today... my mom keeps saying the same thing to me over and over and over.... she's in my room now but she's too comfortable to get out of my chair.  We're probably leaving soon... until next time.

      We got our PSAT results back today... I didn't do too bad (68-Verbal, 75-Math, 71-Writing).  Actually, that puts me in the 99th Percentile!!  Whoo-hoo!   I told John yesterday that he should create a blog-deally because it would fit him like a sock.  No, really, he could write all the depressing stuff he says in first block on there (no offense John, but you're usually in a bad mood), and the Internet could listen to his spouts of pessimism.  Plus, with that fancy new computer of his and the expected cable modem, he post stuff on as fast as a jackrabbit on a pogo stick!  I think that's all I have to say for today... if I forget anything I'll be sure to post it later tonight.

      I have a few of those poems I promised earlier.  These first three are Haikus...  overwhelming pain seems the darkness never fades trying to break free  the thunder crashes the rain pelts against my back i stand tall throughout  i think of this life wonder if i should give in no motivation  I also have a sonnet I wrote called "Inside of Me"  Feels like an ever-shrinking fuse Like I never felt before Think that you could fill these shoes? Tell me when you hit the floor You should be mindful, I implore Bet you won’t look at me the same If you walk out that door, Don’t go thinking this is a game It really is a shame How you refuse to acknowledge me If you can, just say my name Just open your mind and see Keeping all these things inside My true thoughts I can no longer hide

      I won my first duel today (sort of)... Zach forfeited, but I knew I was going to win anyway.

      Spent the entire day dueling with Harry and playing with a wiffle ball.  I beat Harry, but I gotta admit, it was a struggle.  I also beat Zach once, but he got me back twice.

      Today was the most Monday-ey Tuesday I've ever felt.  I was waiting to update the old blog when I actually had something to say, but I decided to update it today anyway.  All the classes are wrapping up really nicely.  Watching movies some of the time, debating bills in Bitters's, and having some duels in VB.  Speaking of duels... We never concluded that match, Harry.  Best out of 7, right?  Does anyone actually enjoy my regular segment?  If you do, please leave a comment to that effect, and I will continue doing that stuff.

      ...and sooner and later you know I'll be dead....   Lost twice today to Harry and Zach.  Guess that's the way the cards roll... or... are shuffled... or... are in your deck.  Harry has comments on his blog now (ahem, Zach and Ryan).

Speaking of Harry, I would like to congratulate him for that delightful little Tale of Two Cities post (albeit I fell asleep half way thorugh it).

      My bill won today!  The vote was 12 for, 10 against, and 7 abstentions.  I think so many people abstained because they didn't understand it, but that's their problem.  My bill passed!!  Btw, if you haven't seen the new Strong Bad E-mail, DO IT!  It is very funny, and I recommend trying the text-based adventure game at the end.  Hints:  1. Watch out for the rope.  2. Try getting the flask several times.  3. Try talking to Dennis.  4. Type "look" at any time to review the contents of a room again.  5. Type "die" at any time to kill yourself.

      Harry said he's like the antagonist, but I'm still not sure of the specifics for this character.  Any helpful information?  Speaking of Harry... he beat me 3 times today in 4th block.  Once it came a little close, but the friggin' heart of the cards must've had some kind of grudge against me or something.  He said all of his victories still don't make up for that one defeat, though.... I guess I'll have to let him beat me some more next week.  Rented True Crime for Xbox.  The reviews were right, but they don't give the storyline as much credit as it deserves.  The camera can be a little weird at times, and some aspects of the game can get somewhat repetitive, yet I can't help but love the shoot-em-up missions.  All in all, I give it a 7 out of 10.  That's it for now! Bye!!

Was beat by Harry (again) in fourth block, but I think I put up a decent fight (by the way, Harry, see page 20 in the rule book).  Here's a couple quotes I just heard on the Simpsons: "It's not just a store, Marge, it's a Mega-store!  Mega means good, and store means stuff!" "Yeah, and I'm not impressed that easily.

      I'm in a predicament much similar to Harry's.  A bunch of last minute Christmas cards and gift certificates have left me with $125 just sitting around.  Should I:  1.

      Please.  But seriously, I'm sorry if I forgot to mention that Caitlin was the first to create a blog (we'll just ignore Cindy and Heather for the time being).  I seem to remember, though, that Emily was the one saying, "You should have one!" when showing off her new chunk of bytes on the World Wide Web.

      Doesn't really feel like a new year.  I know I'm gonna put 2003 on all my papers for like a week, too.  Sorry Ryan!!  I will warn everyone from now on that you have to put in your e-mail address for the comment to go through.  In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have made that a required field.  But you can save the name and e-mail address if you want, so it all balances out in the end.  I've been helping my mom edit her new book for this past week, so I've been a little too busy to update my blog regularly.  But I can't wait for the party tomorrow!  Fun is so cool!  John woke us up this morning when he called to ring in the New Year... that's ok, though, cause I think someone else called us too.  And Cait was up, so you didn't wake up everybody!

      Ok, not really, but this post is dedicated to what I've noticed about her class.  I decided to put this here because of recent events in the classroom (i.e. - John and possibly Harry dropping the class), and I thought that everyone could use my two or three cents.  As some of you have probably heard before, I believe that Miss Baker's teaching process is fueled by a desire deep within her to make her students learn.  If they are learning something, her mission is accomplished.  However, this also depends on the individual student's desire to be taught.  For example: Asa.  Everyone knows that he's kind of a moron (no offense if this ever gets out to him), so Baker's powers are limited when trying to penetrate his mind.  Moving on... Baker also feels she needs some form of confirmation that these students are learning.  It is either evidenced through the work they put into homework, the work they do in the classroom, or the grades they get on the tests and quizzes.  I'm not saying this works for everyone, but take me for example.  I put a fair amount of effort into classwork and I usually get 100's on her tests and quizzes, but not because I care about her class.  It's because I care about my GPA and I can absorb most of that stuff fairly easily, so Baker gets the impression that I'm working hard most of the time.  If someone chronically forgets their homework or does not get very good test grades, it's not always because they don't care about Latin, but rather because they may not have time for her crappy homework or they don't understand the test material very well.  Nevertheless, I think that Baker sees this as an insult to her and her class, and she immediately confronts them on the issue.  They aren't learning anything, and she feels it is her duty to get them "on the right track," especially if she somehow thinks that they normally get good grades in other classes.  Now, the problem I see between Miss Baker and John/Harry is that they, mainly because of other, more important classes or activities, have little time to do homework at home or prepare for her tests and quizzes.  In addition, we like to joke around and talk a lot during her class when we're supposed to be working or doing group activities.  Therefore, noticing this sloppy, sometimes rushed work and a couple poor test grades, Baker seems to enter a sort of mode.  In this mode, she feels she has to put pressure on the students to work harder and care more about learning the Latin.  This added pressure, though, is usually unwelcome, and it only adds on to the stress that we have as students.  Don't get me wrong.  I like Miss Baker as a person.  She just... has some weird quirks inside the classroom that other, better teachers don't dwell on.  It seems like Miss Kuhar could care less if someone doesn't want to do her work.  And she's right - their grades will reflect it, and in the end, it will be on them.  Unless they only need a high enough grade to pass, and they only want enough credits to graduate; then they can move on to their high-paying, gratifying jobs at Burger King and such.  But Miss Baker doesn't see that, and it's only causing her and her students more stress.  She has to work hard at making us learn, and we have to get good grades as well as fill her personal little "quota" of learning.  That's my opinion.  And for some reason, I feel like expressing my opinions a lot today.... Btw, John, I need to talk to you about this weekend.  I'll try to get in touch with you later.

      This test is going to suck.  How are we supposed to write essays about things we "discussed" in class for less than 20 minutes?  Are we expected to memorize everything spewed from Baker's mouth?  This year's going to be a lot different than years past, mainly because of that gay-ass book we have to read, analyze, scan, translate, and memorize.  I hate The Aeneid!!  I hate Virgil!!!   I hate Baker!!!!   More on this topic as it develops....

      Uh, yeah.  Seems like I was losing all hope there.  So... umm.... I guess I want to keep the blog after all.  I was just a little frustrated, and no one had posted for over a week.  I'll try to keep the posts fresh, though I doubt I can measure up to the comedic gold that is Speedy's Bloggy.  Speaking of the devil... er... golden boy: my parties aren't good enough for you?  I mean, come on, Emily's got an array of good movies, lots of great food, and carpeted floors, but... well there's that screen!  And don't forget the Xbox ::sprays of compressed air heard in the background::.  But really, I try my best.  And I AM getting a brand new Xbox.  Trust me; when you see the real deal, you'll want one for yourself.  That's it.  Expect more later.  See ya!

I guess I could leave it up just to have it here... but it's getting kind of pointless as of late.  Have fun over the break!

But anywho, I guess I can't do those quotes of the day/week anymore nor will you be able to access previous ones.  Unless....  I'll have to come up with a new way, or start a new account or something.  I might have to be a little more sneaky about this one though.  Nothing else to say.  Wait, yeah there is!  I got a new bookbag cause the one I got from that contest was for girls... this one's much more masculine.  You'll see it when school comes around again.  Unless....

      I came back from that Voice of Democracy thing today.  Here's the details:  1.)  I had fun. 2.)  The food was good. 3.)  I got a snowglobe. 4.)  I also got a bookbag but my sister is going to use it. 5.)  I have to get some shots tomorrow. 6.)  This list is having less and less to do with the Voice of Democracy dealie. 7.)  I still have that money I wanted to spend.... I have a dynamic idea, but I may have to talk with John before I can do it (cause, you know, everyone needs the overflowing wisdom and approval of John before executing a dymanic idea.) 8.)  It's getting late. 9.)  Oh! And the snowglobe plays the national anthem.  I'm spent.  See ya!

      My Zire 71 is on its way.  It was shipped yesterday, and everything I ordered (except for the 128 MB expansion card, which will be in stock shortly) will be shipped to me within 5-8 business days.  My dad has a 16 MB card that he never uses, too, so I can still test the MP3-playing abilities when the device arrives anyway.  So how 'bout that play?  I should never have stood next to Harry when we went outside to meet everyone after the play, though, because it's like standing in a big ol' shadow.  No one can see me, and if they do, I get some generic "Great job" or "Good performance."  I'm just glad it's all over now, cause I can get some sleep and go golfing after school again.  It should be fun.  See everyone later!

      That was me earlier this morning.  Bad news: I'm going to miss a little school/drama during Hell Week.  Good news: they've pumped me full of good ol' antibiotics and my tonsils will decrease to their normal size before you can say "Hicka-bicka-boo" five times fast.  Temperature reached about 104 degrees on Sunday.  Scary.  But I'm feeling better now, and I should be back to tomorrow.  And my dad re-scheduled the SAT's for May 1, but I have to go all the way to Vineland to take them.  Which suckz (unintentionally misspelled, but I'll leave it).  Needless to say, I'm pretty pissed at life right now for this curve ball; think a dose of vitamin LP is in order.  See ya later...  ::hums "In The End"::

      It's too stressful just to think about everything that's happening now. In the next month, I have to worry about memorizing lines for drama, model congress, the start of the golf season, Kuhar, Baker aka. The Furher, band, college visits (there are already a lot on the agenda), Mr. CRHS (what am I doing for this again?), SAT's (conveniently located on the Saturday of our last two play performances), my job, any homework or projects that pop up, and last, but not least, my personal health.  I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting, but this is what I don't get...  Joe comes up to me during drama and tells me his stress level is off the charts (I guess what started this whole stress business in the first place), and this is the big reason: Jenn Layton got cut by an exacto knife, or something along those lines.  I felt like saying, "This is why you're so stressed out?!?"  To me, if someone else is hurt or sick, you can feel sad, worried, or sympathetic.  But not stressed!  Stress is work that you have to do, stress is your agenda running out of room, stress is having to be at ten different places at once.  If you can help other people through their problems, that's great, but you shouldn't feel stressed because of them.  Especially if you're not married to that person, or in a close, binding relationship.  What I'm trying to get at it, I think, is that Joe, you should worry about yourself some more and loosen up when it comes to other peoples' matters.  Helping is one thing, but you shouldn't get all uptight if the problems don't even affect you.  I may be wrong with some of my opinions, I wrote them down pretty hastily, so feel free to comment as you wish.

      Alright, before I was so rudely interrupted yesterday by the Playskool toy we call a bell, I was on the subject of stress.  And it's not just a normal, aggravating stress, it's a  tiring  stress.  I tried to watch TV last night at 8:30, but I fell asleep half-way through and didn't wake back up until 1 a.m.  And I wish sleep would do something for me, but it doesn't help me at all.  I still feel horrible every single morning I wake up.  I can't believe how many things are going on in my life at once.  To begin with, I haven't heard anything out of my left ear for about a week.  It started when I got a pretty bad ear infection two Mondays ago, and I tried to take some prescription medication to clear it up.  Bad move.  Ever since then, my ear has gone crazy, hurting sometimes, but giving me trouble hearing most of the time.  Loss of hearing was listed on the medication as one of the side-effects you should call your doctor about, but my parents said I was fine.  And if my ear wasn't better by 5 days after I went off the medication (yesterday), I was supposed to call my doctor immediately.  My second main complaint/stresser is my job, if you can call it that.  I work part-time for the Cumberland County Library along with my sister as a consultant, which means I don't have to worry about income tax.  It also means that I never know when I will get paid, as my invoices go through monthly "approval cycles."  I don't think I have seen any money from this job since I started working after school for the first time in September, and I don't have any clue when I will.  I have so much stress from school work and extracurricular activities as well, which I will try to cover in the next post.  See ya!

      My sincerest apologies go out to Becky, whom I have greatly wronged (I think).  Apparently, I wasn't thinking clearly when I left that comment on her blog, and I would like to say that I was concerned for her, but I didn't want to touch on a sore subject (pardon the pun) and Becky said she was feeling okay.  It seems I got excited about nothing anyway because the Creed CD turned out to be by Nickelback.  In conclusion, I'm sorry, Becky.  And if you're Ryan, be sure to read the post below.

      You really need to update, man.  With you and Harry indefinitely out of the picture... let's just say you make the blog experience a whole lot more blogger-ific (i.e. - I'm extremely bored).  007: Everything or Nothing suddenly got  very  tough.... I'm afraid I might have to switch to an easier difficulty to beat this one level.  I get to the last objective, and a swarm of invisible guards surrounds me.  Usually, after killing the first one (using thermal vision, of course), I run out of ammunitions, and that's when the chuds come at me....  I'll get it eventually.  Some awesome levels working up to that point too.  Well, I thought I'd end things with a quote from the coolest guy in the world: "If I keep repeating words throughout posts will they feature advertisements for that word up top there? Like... sex! or... Mail fraud! Bill Clinton! Remote Control! AH! Stroke door handle fondle cheese whippit whip it good super sucky foreign admirals!!!"

      "Never break a bottle of ice on your forehead."  Speaking of John, I saw the comment you left below. Well'sa, I said that you could get out of the locker rooms during a red alert drill by saying you had cancer because they would have to let you leave. I mean, who can say no to a man who's gonna die in a few years anyway? What's one little red alert drill? Seriously though, people with cancer should get some perks for living, like, a pass for free parking at meters, or maybe a discount card that's good for certain purchases. Or, if they're not into living, they should get some cyanide or something. You know, quick-like. But, anywho, that's my view on that. Keep on tranglin'!

Anywho, to comment on Ryan's last post here (cause I can't do it over there!), I DID manage to forget how to play tennis. It's coming back to me... slowly.... but coming back nonetheless. And I'd like to say that, whatever you do, try not to be in gym during the Red Alert drills. Seriously, like, say you have cancer or something and run like hell out of there. It was crazy, man....

      Praise the Blog gods! Ryan has made his return to the internet, I think. The first post was a little short, but I'm thinking there will be more to come shortly.  Ok, Ryan, you asked for it. Here's how you put pictures on your blog: 1.) Get yourself a nice little image hoster. I recommend signing up for the free account at angelfire.com. 2.) Upload your pictures to the images directory of your site. 3.) Link to the images. Use these tags:      And there you go! Here's a little story I'll use to demonstrate: I was on the 15th hole at Holly Hills. Normally, we play the front nine, but there was a match that day, and we were stuck with the back. I hit this beautiful shot off the tee, forgetting about the lake over the hill. The guy we were with said that he hoped the ball didn't roll too far, because it could have made it to the water. I said that it probably didn't, heading forward. But as I started to get down near the lake, I couldn't find the ball anywhere! So I head a little forward, inching my way to the water, when I see it.     Luckily, I had my Palm Zire on me at the time, and I took this picture. That's my ball, in the middle, if you can believe it. Needless to say, with my crappy short game, I wound up with 3 over par, but at least I made it over the water.  Btw, if you don't know already, that picture below is of my dog. She's real cute when she's hungry. So I'll see everyone later. Bye!

      That Rotary thing was crazy! I think I handled it pretty well though. Here are a few comments I heard during the night:  "Well, they can dress them up, but...." I don't think I helped this lady's opinion of the waiters/waitresses any. Shortly after she said this, I almost dropped a tray of salads, and she had to help me gather myself.  "Wow, the service here is...." I never heard the end of either statement, but this one sounded optimistic.  "Are you a pasta-serving guy?" Omg, Joe, the people at one of your tables were pretty mad. They pulled me aside to ask me when their pasta was going to come out. Luckily, Joe was on it in the kitchen.  I got my 128MB expansion card yesterday, and I put the entire Meteora CD on it. The sound quality is awesome with headphones. And for anyone who wasn't at the Rotary dealie, I took a few pictures. You can see 'em when we're back in school tomorrow.  Oh, I just remembered!

Like how we went through at least 45 minutes of class yesterday without doing anything, and then all we did was watch a video. But if slacking off wasn't in her lesson plan, we wouldn't have been doing it, so I think she actually wanted to give us a break for once.  That's all for now. Bye!

      Ok, here's how it went down:  First ~7 times I tried, I died. THEN, that glorious ~8th time, I devised the perfect strategy. I stayed in the corner of the bridge, and when the guy would come charging down, I rolled aside and slash the Bejesus out of him. When he left, I pelted him with arrows until he came back again. That worked until he had about 1/4 health, then those teleporter ninjas started warping over next to me. So I dispatched a few of them, got a little health, and continued slashing the big guy. Finally, I heard him scream out, and the ninja's all died, and I was like, "Yay! I didn't even have to use my healing potion!" So I go over to where he died, pick up a scroll, and go over to the gate, and when I pressed the X button, the Xbox froze. And I was like, "D'oh!"  Ok, so now I've tried another ~8-9 times. I'm like, "I need another new strategy." So this time, I follow the horse around and slash at it constantly. Eventually, I got it cornered for a second, and I hit it about 6 or 7 times. The guy's at about 1/2 health by now. So now I know I can beat this guy. I mix it up with a few arrows, kill a couple wrap-ninjas for health, use my potion in there somewhere (>  So the moral of the story is: I need a new Xbox.

You walk through a gate onto a bridge, and when you get halfway, the gate behind you collapses in fire. Then the boss guy comes out through the gate in front of you. He's a red ninja guy on a crazy black horse with fangs and horns, and he's holding a huge spear. He twirls it around a few times, his horse growls at you, and the battle begins. This guy charges at you, swings at you, and he has this move where he drags you around and throws you up in the air. But he also has these ninja minions, who can teleport around, slash at you, and shoot you from a distance with these magic balls. You can focus on the minions or attack the horse guy mainly, but the minions can re-spawn a certain number of times. And every time you take one out, you can get some health essence, too.  The closest I ever came was when I killed all of the mininons and had the horse guy down to ~1/2 health. I'm gonna have to give it another shot later. See ya!

      Ok, since I have to post AGAIN, I might as well post about Ninja Gaiden, which I just rented today.  First of all, this has to be the hardest game I have ever played! The bosses are insanely tough, and you have to use blocking, combos, rolling to avoid attacks, magic, potions, and, quite frankly, a bit of luck to beat them. It probably took me... ::counting on fingers::... 5 tries before I beat the first boss, and I've already tried the second boss 4 times before I decided to take a break.  Secondly, the crazy crap you can do in this game is amazing! You have to run across walls, throw ninja stars, solve puzzles and such, and I thing there's a way to use ninja powder (j/k... XD). In part of the second level, I had to run across water to get to a secret area. It was fun.  Also, it looks like a have a whole lot more weapons, spells, secrets, and abilities to unlock. More on that later...  Holy crap... there's this thing on TV about a gay prom for Unitarians or something... there was a big rainbow in the background and a whole bunch or girls dancing with other girls. I think they called it the "Prism Prom." ::shudder::  I know you might be getting sick of me saying this, but here it is again: how about that Baker? Will she ever give the seniors in our class a break? And does it seem as though she's been contradicting herself lately? On one hand, we have to rush to "get done what she has planned to get done," but on the other, we are watching movies about cathedrals, looking at books about stained glass windows, and listening about the myth of Daedalus and his dumbass son, Icarus. And what about the movie "Troy"? We're reading about people slicing other people's throats, women getting raped, and we've watched "Gladiator" and "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" un-censored in class. When I watched "A Funny Thing Happened," she wasn't even in the room! Damnit if she isn't making up bad excuses to avoid seeing that movie, which, by the way, directly relates to the book we're reading. The Icarus story had less to do with the book than the movie does!  And does anyone else notice what Baker's doing with this next test? She's trying to make it harder and more complicated than all the others. Now we're supposed to not only study the Latin, but know the English inside and out as well? Bullshit. And that stuff about drawing a picture of the underworld.... she's just asking for someone to do a last-minute, crappy job and expect her to give them full credit. "You can draw stick figures... it can be the size of a normal piece of paper... as long as it's done, you'll get a 100...." I'm about to do it in SERA or something, just to see the look on her face. It'll be like this: >

      This question pretty much summarizes my view on posting right about now. But anywho....  How about that show on the WB tonight, you know, the one where they pick the worst singers? That looks pretty cool....  And how about that Baker? Actually, her class got just a little bit better, except for a few things that have been bothering me recently. First of all, what is all this "discussed in class"? She says that anything that comes out of her mouth is liable to be on any quiz, test... but does she really expect us to take notes on all the crap that she talks about? Most of the "topics" that we are supposed to be tested on were either mentioned in less than 2-3 minutes in class, or they were part of the daily busy-work that we scribble down on the backs of our books and papers.  Secondly, she needs to re-adjust some of her expectations of us (aka. during the boring movies she puts on). Seriously, tell me when we will need to know about the soap-opera-esque snooze-fest that is I-Claudius or the information session on that chapel we're supposed to be going to later this month. Who cares about the damn tours they give to little kids? And poor David... he's not even going on the stupid trip and she won't let him do his make-up work during the video!! Well, I shouldn't say it will be a stupid trip... I mean, it's getting us out of school, right?  That's it for now, see ya!

      Here's a sneak peak at the juicy action!  "Hear my plea!  I am nothing without you, only a shadow of my former self.  Maybe if I had a parting gift, an Aeneas Junior to roam around the house, I would not be so desperate for your face.  I have a longing in my breast that cries out when you are not near, and I pray to the gods that you will find it in your heart to stay here with me."  This is Dido trying to arouse Aeneas with her sex-talk in the letter I wrote. The people in the class woulld understand that stuff like this is common in the actual book. And you guys should see the poster Zach and I made today... XD. I'll have to bring in some photos if I get the chance.

      Here are a few pics of the recent shenanagens at the lunch table today:        If you aren't cool and/or have never seen a picture of him before, this is my good buddy John, chugging an Arizona Iced Tea. I guess we just all thought it would be funny to take a picture of him doing this (notice Heather's head titling back as John finishes off the last drops), and after it was all said and done, John wanted me to put these on the ol' blog. So here you go!

      Blogspot's looking kind of (dare I say it)... cool. Don't think I can say the same of Ryan's new layout... just kidding! But seriously, it sucks, Ryan. Change it back.  Hmmm... it seems my plans for targeted advertisements have failed. Toyota Matrix! Toyota Matrix! Toyota Matrix! There, that should do it.  Speaking of the new car, I was out for a little drive today. Plus, while I was at the mall, I finally picked up Hybrid Theory and put it on my Palm when I got home. It was like, blasting off to the moon, and finding a space monkey there, and bringing him back to Earth to play with you everyday! Well, not exactly, but you get the idea. See ya!

      Got a 2004 Toyota Matrix. (I'm assuming saying this will make my ads focus on cars for a week.) It's not my car, really, but I'll be driving it more often than our other car, I think. My mom already has plans for selling it as soon as I am out of the house, though, so I'll have to try not to get too attached.  Went to some Veterans Ceremony today with the band. It was sooooo straight. After I cam back, we went out for dinner. God, I swear, I could eat a bucket full of General Tso's chicken anytime, anyplace. Here comes the drooling.... ::drools in aforementioned fashion::  Well folks, Angelfire suxors. I guess they don't want us using their webspace to host our images anymore or something... which is totally straight. And by straight, I mean... the word that should apply.  What is up with that essay Baker sprung all up on us last Friday? Everyone was telling her the same thing: "Can't we choose only one half / guys write as Aeneas, girls as Dido?" She was ignorant to every remark. Cut us some slack, lady!! We have lives outside of your class, you know!! Anywho, I didn't have anytime for her essay OR that Physics project so far this weekend. The Physics is more important, I think, so I'll try to work on that first.  El post-o complete-o!

      I need to start posting some real things, not just a few words or comments. So here it goes....  Some people have been feeling pretty strongly, I guess, about the gay jokes Ryan spews ever so much, but I don't think too much of them. I mean, black people make fun of white people, comedians make fun of famous people... it's no different to me. Personally, I also think that homosexuality is wrong, no matter what platter society serves it up on. Recently, I was over at my grandmom's house when my cousin (father of 3) was there with his daughters. He said that they read books in school saying stuff like, "It's alright to live with one mom (picture of single mother), it's alright to live with your grandmom (picture of old lady), it's alright to have two dads (picture of two gay dudes)." So it's not like gays aren't part of our society today. Why can't we joke about them in the same manner as everything else we hold in comtempt?  Speaking of gay, I have the feeling that Baker's class is going to be hell when we go back tomorrow. She'll probably go into overdrive to make up for the "lost day." Oh, God.... here are a few things that I've found interesting about her behavior recently:  1.) Distractions. We try our best to pull her off topic or get her to talk more about a particular word/phrase in a translation, but eventually, when she catches, she just gets pissed off and kicks into hyperdrive again. Distractions have to be subtle, not too off topic, and could use a little knowledge of the translation or what the notes say.  2.) The Lesson Plan. To Baker, this is like the god of the class. We must not stray from the almighty Lesson Plan, lest we be smoten. Her class could use some loosening up. Maybe a free day of just some translation, and what's not finished could be homework. That way, everyone is working, cause no one would want to take that stuff home. But that creates another problem: finishing early. God forbid someone having nothing else to do! Good, diligent students should be rewarded with extra time; that's the way a good classroom works!  Dinner time has interrupted my posting again. I should go on a hunger strike, like that Caesar Romero guy....

      We had a guy in our city (named after the President Fillmore) whose name was Phil.  So when we were assembled as a city on our way to lunch/an assembly/pretty much anything, he would say, "Phil!" and we would all chant, "More!", thus chanting, "Fillmore!"  Phil started a club on the second floor of our building (my floor, unfortunately) called the Shower Club.  I am a little unsure of the details, but I think that, from what I heard, all of the participants of the Shower Club got naked together and all took their showers at the same time.  Needless to say, I was never a member.  And during Andre's trial (see below), Phil rolled his underwear up into a thong, got someone to write Fillmore on his ass, and ran by Pierce City wearing a hat and some shaving cream on his face.  Some other guys followed him wearing make-shift thongs as well, but I think Phil put on the best act.  When my friend, Adam Ross, was running for Gubernatorial Candidate for our party, he had to face off against this puny little dork named Stuart Lombardi.  This kid looked like he couldn't get any from a dog in heat, but he had good public speaking skills.  So after all the candidates gave their speeches and everyone started chanting Stuart's name, I was a little worried.  However, Adam and I found out later that day from someone in our dorm that he had been giving out business cards since as soon as he got off the bus.  This, according to Boys' State rules, was an unauthorized campaign material and means for a disqualification.  So, after we did a little searching, we found one of the cards.  It read, "Stuart Lombardi, Candidate for Governor."  Right then, I realized that something was f***ed up about this guy.  So we reported it to our head counsillor, he confirmed that it could mean disqualification, and I was astonished to find that his name wasn't removed from the ballot when it came time for elections.  Apparently, they had a talk with Stuart, and he told them that he started giving out the 1,000(!) business cards he had printed before he knew about the rules.  I think he should have been disqualified anyway, but he stormed the election and went off to win Governor.  Because he meet Adam when they were candidates together, he appointed him Deputy Chief of Staff, and then Adam appointed me to an Appellate Court Judge.  And I still think that Stuart had no clue that we reported the business card thing to the authorities or that I voted for the other guy.  Oh well....

      Ok, each dorm at Rider University was a make-believe city in New Jersey. I was in Fillmore City, and I meet a whole bunch of other guys while living there. My roomate Travis, Jordan and Adam Rothman (two of three triplets), and my buddy Adam Ross to name a few (if I told you about my blog and you're reading this now, feel free to comment). Then there was a guy named Andre. This guy wouldn't let anyone push him around, and consequently, he got in a bit of trouble with the neighboring dorm of Pierce City. You see, they had soda machines in thier lounge, and we didn't even have a lounge. But they taped off the machines in order to promote their soda/snacks fundraiser, for which they sold the soda for more money/fluid ounce. So Andre, not giving a shit about Pierce's fundraiser, goes into their lounge to use the soda machines, which our councillor said was ok, but which also went against Pierce's city laws. So, eight municipal court summons(es?) later, Andre has to attend a court session in their city. He sits there calmly, takes every chance he can to call Pierce City a bunch of idiots, and winds up proving that 7 out of 8 of the summons slips were filled out incorrectly. I think they sentenced him to a fine of 200 Boys' States Bucks (like Boys' State Monoploy money) and a night in Pierce City jail. Needless to say, Andre did neither. But he's alright. I want to be like him when I grow up....  Coming soon: more crazy Boys' State stories incluiding Phil of Fillmore and the Shower Club, the Stuart Lombardi controversy, and the Fillmore City Guide-on!  And by the way, I would recommend Incubus's "A Crow Left of the Murder" to anyone who even remotely liked "Make Yourself."

      That's right, boys and girls....  Summer's here! And after tonight all the peeps on my Friends List (as well as myself) will be seniors! Yay!!  That having been said... what's going on? I haven't seen some of my friends that I normally see in the halls/lunch/SERA for a couple of days. On Sunday I leave for Boy's State. I'll be there 'til Friday, so expect a big update when I get back! Or else....  Finals seemed to go well. But I should've gotten a 100 on my Pre-Calc final! I'm so pissed! Damn you, Calculus!! I'm in desperate need of an effigy....  What was my last attempt at a daily/weekly/monthly segment? I think it went a little something like:   The Philosophical Statement of the Day!!!  "You can’t have your cake and eat it too."  Mmmm... cake....  Oh crap! John, remember when I was laughing hysterically during the Latin Final today? I was writing the essay comparing/contrasting Aeneas's journey and those twelve deals that Campbell guy made up, and I went to write "determined by his goal," but you know how you can some-the-times accidentally cross letters other than t's? I wrote on the paper "determined by his goat." It was funnier at the moment, though. But that's all I have to say about that.  More later. See ya!

      Pretty crazy at the ol' lunch table today. Ryan wondered what it would be like if someone licked the side of their mouth and simultaneously squinted really hard while they talked. This is what ensued:        Hehe... they make me laugh.  Physics project is all finished and turned in.

Yeah, this is that guy Sean who just doesn't seem to stop coming over to our nice little table at lunch and bothering us. Today, he decided to eat his brownie in a way that... well... you decide.        And you may not even want to see him drinking his milk....     I think that's all I have for now.

      Ok, ok... I'm back from NYLF. To begin with, the best part was going to Dorney Park last Sunday and riding every single coaster there... some twice.&nbsp;I have one of those dumb pictures you can buy when you get off the coaster of me and my friend Tom making faces on Steel Force. It was awesome.  Also, Saturday was pretty fun when they let us loose at the King of Prussia mall. I  finally  bought the first two seasons of Family Guy on DVD, and I finished one and a half&nbsp;disks already.&nbsp;The guy at the Discovery Store even let me, Tom, and my friend Tony watch part of one episode on a portable DVD player they had set up in the store.&nbsp;But by far, the Sharper Image store was the best part of the mall visit. We sat in the massage chairs, played with the magnetic dart board and remote-controlled Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, and I even "found" a complementary chilled Dasani water in the store's portable fridge.  Lemme tell you a little story about what happened earlier that day.&nbsp;They let us loose in Historic Philly and tell us to stay within the area shown on the little maps they gave us.&nbsp;No one did.&nbsp;The group I went out with consisted of myself, Tom, Tony, a Cuban guy named Alex, and a Dominican girl named Elizabeth. I don't know if you are aware of the relationship between Cuba and the Dominican Republic, but let me tell you, they were going back and forth pretty much the entire time.&nbsp;Alex attempted to take us down to South Street to Pat's (I think) to get some Phiily cheesesteaks, but we end up having to ask for directions. When we get there, a huge line was stretched around from the entrance of the building down the street.&nbsp;So we turned around and entered the first resturant we saw: an Irish Pub-like deal. I think everyone ordered a cheesesteak except for Alex, since he had eaten already.  A little background on Tony: this guy is a fluent-speaking Chinese swordsman with a crazy appetite.&nbsp;At Dorney Park, he ate two cheeseburgers, a side of fries, a large soda, two hot dogs with everything on them, macaroni salad, fried chicken, a cup of ice cream, and he was saying that he could go for a funnel cake afterwards.&nbsp;When our cheesesteaks come, he starts digging in. The conversation is still going, and he's still talking, but he's stuffing his face in between making various comments. Literally, one minute it was there, and a couple minutes later it was gone. And after he had finished the whole thing he stopped for a few seconds, looked down at his plate, and said, "Dude, where's my cheesesteak??"  Hopefully, I'll remember more stuff later, and I might even comment on the educational value I got out of this trip.... ::stifled laughter::  See everyone soon! Buh-bye!

      Trying to get some sumemr reading done... and definitely not succeeding.  I've read the first book already,  Dubliners , but I have yet to answer the (2) questions.  Pathetic, right?  I'm beginning to wonder when I'm ever going to start the 500-page monstrosity of  Light in August , or when I'll have time to answer the questions.  These jobs are just driving me crazy!  My mom already wants for me to quit the new one because she ends up having to drive me there or pick me up at least once a day.  Stupid lack of a driver's license....  By special request, I will now talk about a girl at the forum named Meghan.  I think she referred to herself as the "forum slut" on a couple of occasions, mainly because she couldn't remove her arms from around this guy named Joe throughout the entire time we spent there.  We became pretty good friends in spite of this, though (lol).  She kept saying that I was jealous of them because I made fun of their relaionship a few times, but I wasn't really.  And I don't think I was the only person in our MED group who was aware of how well Meghan and Joe got along, too... but she was pretty cool.  At least, as cool as a person who doesn't like shoes can be.
