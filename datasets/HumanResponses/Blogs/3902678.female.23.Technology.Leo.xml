      Work was decent today, I spent a lot of time in training again, YAY! However, my keyboard broke, my phone broke, I had to move to a different cube with no friends to sit beside and I had all kinds of tough issues to tackle that I had to call supervisors and specialists for repeatedly.. oh well, at least I learned something... riiiiiight.... and I didn't get another awful nosebleed like I did yesterday, wwhich is always a plus. I get excited over the small things. Looking forward to hanging out with friends on the weekend and renting The Butterfly Effect and Donnie Darko, both of which I haven't seen before, so don't ruin it for me! My friend Stan moved and was supposed to have his internet reconnected today, but I don't see him online, so I'm hoping maybe he will be a little vampire like me and come on late tonight. Right now waiting for my husband to come home from work and get me so we can go eat dinner.. I'm starving! All I've eaten today was a yoghurt, some candies, sandwih, coffee, diet pills and a bottle of water. And had a few cigarettes which are making my throat sore but I'm starting to like them again. Uh oh. Someone come online and chat with me! Message me on MSN or Yahoo! Talk to me on Hi5! Comment on my boring BLOG! Anything! Need human contact please, even though I get it all day, if I'm without it I start getting withdrawal pains!

      Today was a good day at work, I sat with my friend Adam and a really cool chick named Melissa and we had a lot of fun. I spent a lot of my day in paid training, too, which is always nice for a change. There is a cute supervisor boy that sits near us who has shoulder length hair and that kind of "I just rolled out of bed" style. He's pretty dreamy and nice to look at while working, but I'm getting teased a little about it now... guys, I'm married, I'm not DEAD! The only bad thing about today was on my first lunch I got a bad nosebleed unexpectedly. After work we took pictures of our friend Mitchell's Jeep because Adam's mum might buy it and then Adam can over for dinner and we had spaghetti and beer. I'm really tired so I'm going to bed now, I was just playing around online and thought I'd blab here for a minute.

      Just had to post that Civic... not the price or anything, just the car... holy dream car Batman! I want a 1997 Honda Civic si-r....mmm... special edition with the body kit in the beautiful indigo blue would be nice although I must say I like the custom paint job, and red IS my favorite colour. I love cars...

      What a weird weekend. Hung out on Friday night with a friend, grabbed some coffee, went for a drive, he has a cool old 60's car that I'd love to buy. On Saturday I went shopping and got new clothes and shoes and purple hair dye, but I forgot to go to To The Point and look into getting my eyebrow pierced like I've been meaning to. GRRRR. Sat around last night and went to sleep early, feeling a little grumpy with my friend situation at the moment. My best friend moved to Ontario on Friday and that's making me feel kind of sad and another friend is kind of frustrating me but ANYWAYS enough about that... whine, whine, bitch bitch... who needs friends anyways? I have a cat and a dog. :) Today Al (my husband) and I went to the antique shops and boutiques in Ft Langely and then to a farewell BBQ for a friend of his who has been a youth pastor at our old church for almost 10 years and is just leaving to pursue other opportunities. It was kind of cool, got to see some old church friends whom we haven't seen since we moved, and that was nice, we have been "kind of" going to church since we moved but haven't really connected with anyone. In a way it was scary though, they are all married and look the same with the same clothes and hair and strings of matching kids named McKenzie and Dakota and Madison..... yikes! That is frightening to me, I never want to be like that...On the way home we got to talking about how maybe when we got married a year ago it was a little too soon for me and I am really starting to realize that now, wishing I'd had a few more years to do what I want and have my freedom without being obligated to someone.. not that my husband isn't a wonderful guy (he's awesome and my best friend) but I think I just wasn't ready for the responsibility yet. Now I feel bad because he is being so patient with me and says he's going to sit back and wait for me to get myself sorted out and figure out what I want to do, and I don't KNOW what I should do. I'm not "unhappy" we do have fun together and we never fight, I just think we should have done some stuff differently or maybe make some changes before it's too late. We are quite different people, that could be it too. Maybe I should be with someone more like me? I don't know. Anyways, I don't even really know what I'm using Blogger for but if anyone out there wants to chat, I am outgoing, cheerful, friendly and always like meeting new people, feel free to get in touch! Hope your weekends were fantastic.....
