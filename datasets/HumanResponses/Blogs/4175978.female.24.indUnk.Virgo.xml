						   More marriage guy thoughts - Upon further reflection, it seems to be the "cling factor" of the prototypical marriage guy that repels me. I'm too independent to be with someone who needs to be with me all the damn time. But now on to the goods.  While talking with Melanie tonight, I had the whopper of epiphanies. My FAVORITE Disney movie (and probably my favorite love story) of all time is  Lady and the Tramp . Let's see, what's that story about? A perfect little sheltered princess (okay, so that's not so much me, but bear with me here) meets a philandering scoundrel. He falls hopelessly in love with her, forsakes all the other bitches, and becomes a housedog. The moral? Deep down, all the bad boys are really just looking for the right girl to settle them down, and if you are a special enough girl, they will give up their dirty dog ways and become housebroken. Damn you, Disney. Isn't it bad enough you filled my young mind with ideas of Prince Charming? At least those were blatant and obvious and I learned relatively early that he was fictional. But  Lady and the Tramp ?! That was sneaky, very sneaky. So now that I have identified the root of my issues, what do I do about it? For now, I figure I've made my doggie bed, so I'd best enjoy lying in it while I can... (That means I'm going to sleep on it.)

						   I live in one of the top 10 WORST cities in the country for dating and frequently travel to one of the top 10 best cities for dating.  At least now I have an excuse.

						   Again tonight I face a debate I have waged with myself repeatedly over the years - should I or should I not give into a craving? I stepped onto the scale today (at the gym - go, me!) and found that I have gained eight pounds since moving to Atlanta at the end of June.  I think this is in large part due to the fact that when I get home from work I seem to sit in front of the TV and eat everything I can get my hands on.  I am resolved to do something about this issue, and I think it will be to 1) find something else to do with my time in the evenings and 2) start Weight Watchers (I know, I know) this week.  However, I am currently battling with a MAJOR double craving for ice cream (in Carissa-world, ice cream means low-fat frozen yogurt, by the way) and chocolate.  I know from previous experience that if I do not give in to this craving, I will end up eating all sorts of other things until I finally give in and go to the store anyway, so I figure I might as well just go now and save myself the interim snacking.  Thus, I enter the shame spiral.  See you at the bottom.

						   Out with my friend Zander tonight, I tell him about my recent realization about my distaste for marriage guy.  He says he thinks marriage guy will jump up and bite me in the ass (naughty, yes, but you understand); it's the guys who are so determined to settle down that i can see it from a mile away that are the ones who bore me.  Zander said, "Girls don't like bad boys; they just want to have a good time.  And guys don't like girls who treat them bad; they just want to have a good time too!"  I also realized that I totally have a type.  It's anyone who is remotely similar to the guy I'm into at the moment.  Take for example the guy I picked out in the bar tonight (Z and I were playing "who would you go home with if you had to pick one person here?").  He was 1) the barback 2) wearing a fun hat 3) medium-tall 4) compact and muscular 5) wearing glasses but oops - married.  At some point, actually many years ago, the first thing I check out on a guy became the wedding ring finger.  Somehow I missed it for a solid hour tonight. At least I didn't hit on him.  Thus ends my first Saturday night out in Atlanta.  I love Decatur  - feels like home (Chapel Hill).  Perhaps I'll branch out into the wild dance clubs in Buckhead in the coming weeks...

						   All week, I was excited about going out to this Latin dance club with my coworker, but she bailed on me at the last minute.  I had a couple other options for going out, but I ended up deciding to stay at home and veg.  But here's the thing: I actually enjoyed just being alone and relaxing out on my porch with a drink more than I would have enjoyed getting dressed up, driving out to an unknown location, finding parking, walking to a crowded bar, paying for drinks, walking alone back to my car, and driving home tipsy.  Does this mean I'm actually an introvert? The inimitable Carrie Wachter has postulated a third personality type, which I think is more fitting.  Extroverts recharge by being the center of attention in a large group.  Introverts recharge by being alone.  This third personality type (we'll call them Carriverts) recharges by being in a one-on-one or small group environment with their intimate friend(s)/lover(s).  The problem for me currently is that my intimate friend(s)/lover(s) are elsewhere, so the only way I can recharge is either by driving long distances or by talking to them on the phone, and I think I'm starting to drive everyone a little nuts with my incessant phone calls.  I do have 2.5 friends with the makings of being very close friends in Atlanta, but two of them don't like to go out at night and the other one I haven't even managed to see since i moved here because she's been too busy. I'd love to branch out my circle of friends, but now that I'm not in school anymore, I'm not sure how to go about doing that.  As a friend-making measure, I'm about to go down to the pool in my apartment complex and see if anybody down there wants to make nice.

						   The link is to the latest Strong Bad email on homestarrunner.com It speaks to me because this is basically what I was like (Strong Bad) when I worked with children.  Also because when talking to Melanie last night, I came up with an idea for the Super Duper Kama Sutra when Mel talked about needing a book with all the letters in all the positions - with pictures.  (FYI, Super Duper is a company that makes tons of materials for speech therapists to use with children).

						   My work here is done - my darling Melanie wants to spread the joy that is my random musings (that ARE my random musings? No, joy IS - although musings ARE).  Hoo-aa.  So today was a day of realizations.  First, Laura led me down the path of self-discovery.  She pointed out, and I was forced to agree, that I just don't go for "marriage guy," the guy who's looking to settle down.  As my friends find these relationships that get way serious way fast, I find myself frightened and perplexed.  I recognize that there have been quite a few of these marriage-bound men who have been interested in me; I've even gone out on a few dates with them, but I always end up with the same repulsed feeling.  It's not just that I'm not interested; I'm repelled by them.  Case in point, Brad (aka the guy to whom I had to say, "I'm not your whore.").  Okay, so he was weird beyond the looking to settle me down thing.  It's not the bad boy thing.  I'm way past that.  I think I just 1) don't trust anything that comes too easily and 2) want to know that if someone falls in love with me and wants to be spend his life with me, it's because of me, not just because he was ready to settle down. So am I repelled by marriage guy because I'm afraid of commitment, because I'm afraid of getting my heart broken again, or because I'm just afraid of being bored?  Okay, that was a long realization.  Here's the other:  So there's this guy, and after knowing each for only a very very short time, I already felt like I knew him, really knew him.  Oddly enough, I even felt like I could trust him, and I don't think I've really trusted any man in years.  When we were talking tonight, we were telling each other about all these things we've done in our past, and I suddenly realized that we really don't know each other at all.  I don't think it's a bad thing  or a good thing; it's just strange that I can feel I know him so well when I really just plain don't.  The more I think about it, though, the more I realize that my intrinsic sense about people is what makes me good at my job.  Most of the time, I can sense what my patients need from me - a slave driver to kick their asses into gear, a shoulder to cry on, a calming influence, a cheerleader, whatever.  I feel like I know them, even though they've only told me a little piece of their life history.  So it's a boon in my professional life, but in my romantic life, I think it's a little dangerous for me.  It makes it easy to skip the "getting to know you" part, which is really where you find out if you're good for each other or not.  Rest assured there will be many more musings on relationships.  For now, I think that'll do.

						   Work is hard. Especially when making up for a weekend without sleep (It's hard to sleep when you're guarding your bed against marauding weirdos wearing hard hats.) and when trying to function on very little food.  However, tomorrow is a 10-6 workday with some actual scheduled downtime, so I may actually be able to (gasp) catch up on everything! The most momentous event of the day was opening my $189 cell phone bill.  20 minutes later, I had talked the customer service woman at Verizon into knocking off $60, but I'm still up shit creek.  I'll take suggestions for ways to make a quick buck. In other news, it's 8:30 and I'm seriously thinking about going to sleep.  I remember when I was a little kid and I was bouncing off the walls until midnight and my mom said she wished she could bottle up my energy and sell it - or use it herself - now I'm wishing I had gone along with the plan.  I could be rich, or just awake.  I think I'd settle for awake at the moment. Oh, well, asleep is okay too.

						   This week and weekend have left me with some questions. What would make a man think any of the following is okay:   Adjusting/scratching himself in public  Sitting next to a total stranger in a bar and beginning to talk to her about visiting other planets, then acting like SHE'S the weird one because she seeks clarification as to whether his astral self or corporeal self was doing the travelling  Trying to make your girlfriend so jealous that she just goes ahead and breaks up with you so you don't have to do the dirty work yourself  Taking a plastic ring off a cupcake, making a total stranger lick the icing off the ring, licking the rest of the icing off the ring yourself, putting the ring on her finger, and licking icing off her hand in the process [Granted, what may have made the man in this situation think this was okay could include large amounts of alcohol and the fact that I am rife with flirtatious energy even when I don't mean to be, but still...]  Following this same girl to the room where she is sleeping on an air mattress, even after she has avoided him all night after the cupcake incident - and trying to kiss her  Walking into the room an hour later and trying to get in bed with the same girl who shut the door on him when he tried to kiss her
