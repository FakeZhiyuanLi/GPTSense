      Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to this, the first post of my soon-to-be rant-laden weblog. I have a name and that name is not Bongo Bill, but you will know me as Bongo Bill because I have a healthy wariness of random Internet strangers knowing my full name. Perhaps one day I will decide otherwise and share with you all my name. But until then I am Bongo Bill, and don't you forget it.  This being a rant-oriented blog, I suppose I should begin with a rant. And since you are, in fact, looking at a blog, it is only fitting that I begin with a rant about blogs.  It is the greatest strength and the most critical weakness of weblogs as a medium of communication that anyone at all can own one. It is accessible to anyone who meets the simple requirements of being able to type and occasionally having access to that wonderful overgrown network, the Internet. And yet at the same time, because of the fact that anyone can make one, a blog begins with zero credibility as a source of information and insight. The lamentable truth is that the cause of this is the following train of thought: if anyone can do it, it must not be anything special; the chances are a thousand to one that a normal person's mundane weblog will have anything worthwhile, or will even be tolerable to read.  I have made this blog, using its greatest strength, fully confident that I can elevate it beyond that greatest weakness. This will be a blog where every post will hopefully present to the reader some insight into their own mind, some amusing bit of trivia, a hearty laugh, a complete paradigm shift, or a bit of fatal cardiac arrest (although honestly I don't plan to make much use of that last one).  The philosophy underlying my life changes from time to time as I drive myself to deeper realms of thought. At present it includes one tenet for which I am sure some of you will be grateful: the duty I have taken upon myself for my life is to deliver to others the sense of awe that accompanies the true understanding of a profound concept.  So in other words, you stick around here long enough, you're bound to learn something. Unless you're reading one of my political rants, in which case you'll either A) already agree with me, or B) not listen to me. I have never in my life been able to convert a person from one political ideology to another. That doesn't mean I won't stop trying, though. It's not my fault you're wrong, but I do what I can to help.

      I wrote this a while back. I'm probably going to edit it and submit it, anonymously or otherwise to a couple of major publications. Anyhow, here it goes. I call it "In Defense of the Nice Guy."     Before I begin, let me say that my statements and generalizations are based off of legitimate social archetypes, also known as stereotypes. I make these generalizations fully confident in the knowledge that if they offend the reader, then the reader really needs to lighten up.   One of the oldest questions to plague the males of the human species is, “What do women want?” or more accurately, “What traits do I need to have to make women want me?” The Nice Guy does not know, but he is sure that everybody in the world except for him and his friends have these traits. He looks at the world and he sees men, usually jerks, who attract women of all manner of personality the way a bug zapper attracts mosquitoes. Only, instead of leaving the women burnt to a crisp as does his insecticidal counterpart, he leaves them heartbroken, pregnant, abused, or some combination of the three. That is where the differences between such men and bug zappers end.  Usually after being left a momentarily crushed and battered soul, the woman turns to her friends for a shoulder to cry on and maybe just a little liquor. The woman’s friends may include a Nice Guy, the ones who curse fate for making them unwilling to pursue a friendship into something deeper; often the Nice Guy harbors a one-sided, unrequited love for the woman crying on his metaphorical shoulder. Those who do occasionally get lucky and find their feelings returned. This isn’t about those Nice Guys, but the less fortunate.  All of this notwithstanding, though, the Nice Guy may be as effective and sympathetic a fellow as the woman is likely to find, yet behind it all he knows in his heart of hearts it’s going to happen again. And again. He keeps his hopes up until the next boyfriend comes in, exactly the same as the last one in his heart of hearts, and bites his tongue rather than say, “I knew it” when the relationship reaches its inevitable conclusion. The woman believed that this latest boyfriend was different, whereas the Nice Guy was not fooled for an instant. Why, then, was the woman so hoodwinked?  The ability to fool women into believing that a guy is not, in fact, going to take advantage of the woman is one of the more lamentable traits associated with having “what women want.” I am not sufficiently disillusioned to imply that it is one of the traits, but merely one of the common side effects. “Hey!” says the bug zapper. “I don’t have to give the mosquitoes any food as long as I can attract them to me.” “Hey!” says the jerk. “I don’t have to actually treat my girlfriend with dignity as long as I can fool women into thinking they love me.”  It is this attitude that drives us Nice Guys insane.  Let me clarify what I mean by Nice Guy.  You probably know several Nice Guys. Chances are some of them are friends of yours. You can usually identify a Nice Guy by the fact that he doesn’t seem to show any outward sign of wanting a girlfriend. Perhaps you think he might be gay, except that other guys don’t seem to do anything for him either. He is usually a thoughtful sort of guy who practices random acts of kindness with a frequency greater than zero, and he tends to either genuinely care about his work or studies, or have a time-consuming hobby, or (more frequently) both.  Much of this is a ruse. On the one hand, we’re not called Nice Guys for nothing. On the other hand, our ineffective but altogether admirable method of finding romance involves living by the very image of the sort of man we believe a woman would be most happy with: someone polite, generous, industrious, devoted, and anything but ruled by his sex drive. In a word, chivalrous, but without the sexism.  We, having no idea whether or not that’s what women are really looking for, nevertheless cling to it because anything less would be sacrificing our dignity; it really is an admirable lifestyle. People like Nice Guys.  However, no woman wants to date a Nice Guy, for reasons we cannot begin to comprehend. Some of us abandon our personal code of Nice Guy ethics in an effort to draw in women the way the bug zapper men do. But that defeats the purpose: either he has deceived the woman and she finds herself involved with a man different from the one she fell in love with, or he has become one of the enemy, abandoning everything he knows to be good and admirable for the sake of finally ceasing to be single. We Nice Guys are effectively hedged in by hypocrisy and the sense of honor that sets us apart from the bug zappers. We cannot have what women want without sacrificing what makes us Nice Guys, and we cannot show women that we are the solution to their problems with men without violating the same essence of our Nice Guy-ness.  That leaves our salvation to the women.  Ladies! As a small child, were you ever enthralled by the classic fairy tales, where a Prince Charming or a Sir Galahad or a, well, a Nice Guy comes and rescues the beautiful princess, in whose role you placed yourself, and then they lived happily ever after?  Well, unfortunately, that doesn’t happen. They’re fairy tales for a reason.  A Nice Guy will certainly rescue you from imminent peril, but he’d probably stand around awkwardly after the rescue and after a while clear his throat and say, “Well, I’ll just be going, then,” and then get right back on his noble steed and return to his lonesome existence, brightened only by his hobby of jousting and the occasional futile hope that some damsel, no longer in distress thanks to his valiant efforts, finally realizes that he’s not just doing this for his health.  Then the damsel, no longer in distress, becomes enthralled with another prince or knight who, however dashing he may be, would not have lifted a finger to save the damsel unless he was positively certain he could get use the act of saving her to trick somebody into his pants.  I don’t think we Nice Guys are the only people who don’t like the way this all works out.  And so, women of the world, I beseech you on behalf of all the Nice Guys in the world: take the initiative. The next time you find yourself heartbroken over the loss of another bug zapper, find the Nice Guy who seems to care about it and see if he doesn’t make a better boyfriend.
