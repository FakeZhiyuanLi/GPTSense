      Thats me rediscovering my blogspot..have been educating self on what the world thinks of bloggers..and not very pleased with what I read..hmph.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebel on bloggers!  Finally..folks DO believe Instant&nbsp;Messenger is useful (MSN invested huge greenies in it last week).. I&nbsp;find the&nbsp;whole idea behind the IM rather Zany (noun. Extremely cool and&nbsp;fun.) Thank you for whole-hearted applause.&nbsp;Especially&nbsp;the Yahoo Messenger. The smileys are just unbelievably funny.. Call it my&nbsp;new&nbsp;hobby if you will, but if a messenger allows me to listen to&nbsp;love songs while i play a silly game of cards&nbsp;with my mom,it is a notch above even Zany (noun. The highest form of praise in&nbsp;the blogger dictionary).&nbsp;Anyways..discoveries of the&nbsp;past week.  1) rediscovering Bourne - part. two is plain mindblowing. Damn the critics. Really, if it is a possible action, damn them. Has all the effects needed for a spy movie and it ROCKS!  2) Hearing crazy things about the village..apparently the demons the villagers are scared of are industries and construction crews.hm...i pay 8$&nbsp;for this?  3)&nbsp;Blogmania. from&nbsp;DNC to&nbsp;product launches. Well, smtg like this was bound to happen wasnt it. We had Internet, then mail, then IM (loyalty rolls on)..then the public&nbsp;had zilch to jump&nbsp;around for. Larger mailboxes, yaaawwnn... its like the discovery of fridge Vs. Large&nbsp;fridges. Who&nbsp;cares anymore? but blogging is definitely a phenomenon.&nbsp;Blogging&nbsp;101 in universities,&nbsp;blogger&nbsp;moms and blogging conventions. Will be damned if am not into this early.&nbsp;Then can proceed to preen about life-long blogging talent when am&nbsp;45.&nbsp;Zany as it&nbsp;may seem&nbsp;(Zany. Noun. crazy,illogical or&nbsp;blind sheep phenomenon).  4) waistlines - woeful discovery of the week. waistline remains at a puppy fattish 28 only to grow to 30 by lunchtime. Scientific fact that waistlines balloon during the day (when i shall wear tight jeans that pop out buttons like popcorn by lunchtime). hmph..how Zany is that (Zany. undependable. untrustable).  Oh well..got an exciting week coming up.lets see now. Therez the school reunion tonite at a coffee shop (with a guaranteed "thou shalt be lost" address by Atsuko). Tomorrow shall relaunch ditched website project. Doc apintment on Friday. YUCK..absolutely definite blogging on THAT day...  &nbsp; Zanycally yours    &nbsp;

      Two terms i came across this week...after a mind-numbing task of deciding which one to attack first, have placed my gifted criticism priority on the former, so here goes.  Golf-widows..a rather pathetic term but apparently one who qualifies is J-Lo. Marc Anthony is addicted to golf and the damsel in distress took out enough time to pouteth her lips and sulk about it before she went back to count her fast-depleting money.But seriously, could there be a more self-congratulatory term ever? I mean, this is a sport where the aim is "not to make a fool of yourself". not funny, is the serious truth. Its the kind of sport that one would indulge in, and the rest of the folks around him would go "WHY do you do this to yourself". kinda like waxing and threading that babes subject themselves too (of course..the women who DO wax and thread before their weekly round of golf come across as a psycologically interesting catergory of 'pain lovers')...This is a game where factors do not end at sports skills and weather conditions and calamities such as untied shoe-laces. Oh no siree..It is a game where the factors could include any or all of the following  1) curious rabbits 2) hungry deer 3) frost, dew, insects or any such thing existing in the grass 4)crabs in the sand  Apart from including half of the animal species as considerable factors, one would be required to have a hand-held weather device to indicate wind, snow, sun, wind direction or any such calamities that might decrease the chances of hitting a hole in one.   Inspite of all this, no self-proclaimed golfer could ever say he comes home with a satisfactory golf experience. It takes no less than 6 hours of carting around a golf course to achieve a satisfactory level of frustration before you consider yourself done for the day. Thats right, carting around.God forbid you are caught walking around - fancy gadgets that push your clubs for you  to carts that you can around jiggling in are a part of the experience. snort!! give me good ole waxing anyday. and yeah, throw in a bit of the threading and tweezing too   and WHY would anyone call herself Esther? THERE IS A CHEMICAL ALMOST LIKE THAT NAME ALREADY!!not that madonna was an original name, but if you do wish to switch names, leave chemistry labs and medicines out of it please. Though, it does bring up an interesting option. WHAT would you change your name to? would you change it to smtg that reflects your personality? I would find a whole lot of folks calling themselves pretty and kind walking around then..Me? i would change it to smtg like medussa (during bad hair days atleast) or medulla oblongata (when at my brainiest best) or muddled (a default name)  I would certainly choose smtg that means BAD..that way when i am nice, nobody's complaining..they are only pleasantly surprised...  Anti-golfically yours Medusa muddled Medulla (muddled is my middle name)

      hmm..am supposed to be knee-deep with responses to my blog by now according to my "Despo's guide to blogging" (despo meaning desperate not despodent though lack of resposes invoke similar reactions in self).  Read an interesting article on blogging though (http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64088,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_4) in the time i managed to switch (am self-proclaimed Alt + Tab Queen) to another browser window.   Apparently, blogging takes the life out of bloggers and is considered an ego stroking exercise. hmm.now why would that be? This is exactly the kind of articles that prompt penniless authors to become penniful by writing books such as 'The new social evil of blogging' that goes onto proclaim blogging as a potential threat to productive employees. Then companies can pass resolutions to ban employee blogging, thus making it more tempting for them to bog on the sly - thus making blogsites more successful by the day. Its all a conspiracy i tell you, I didnt watch the Matrix for nothing. Some conspiracies I have noted though:  1) notice how everyone thinks that 'time flies'? Is an international dateline conspiracy. Time IS moving fast, someone up there is spinning the hands right off the clock.  2) How you see ads for hives by Tylenol, and then actually get hives on self? unless therez a psychological implication there, i bet someone is spreading the hives virus coz tylenol made a pill for it.   suspiciously yours  conspiratino

      Thursday morning 9:20 A.M  Laundry merrily hopping in the washing machine.phew!  Whats the deal with laundering? ( i speak entirely in the garment sense here). I pretend its a huge chore that hangs above my head - fact is, it takes three minutes of my precious time to do it.dump, pour and click cycle.Ah, but wherez the joy of moping if i do it when i should? A pal calling inevitably gets the huge sigh "I have TONS of laundry to do". Like i actually sort and bleach and color them right anyways.pshaw!  Eeeks..my first blog and i already complain.hmm..my first blog inspite of reading the nanny diaries and the broke diaries. For the talent scouts reading this out there, I can do much better than this, i swear. For all the pals obligated to read this, skip it. There's no gossip here, neither anything I havent already told you about. Just tell me its a great first blog when you meet me. For the rest, WHY?  Fact is, am terrified of blogging. Kinda reminds me of interviewing. You can talk till your pals scream blue murder, but put you in an interview and your throat goes dry, palms go cold ( i know they popularly sweat, but mine are different) and the loo suddenly seems inviting. Same thing with blogging methinks. I can write pages and pages in MS-Word (with pretty fonts and backgrounds) but put me into a blog and the mind freezes. Questions pop from various unknown areas of the mind "will they like me" "do i sound cool and confident" "Do i sound smart" " Am i ranting too much" "why are they even reading this?".   Oh well. I promised to blog and i shall. oooh.also,I promised to dedicate my first blog to the co-founder of the "ya ya sisterhood" (trust me, we are the originals). So herez to dhana and our sisterhood. As also an ode to the "giggling goats guide to the galaxy" -our long pending guide to insane living.  Weeelll..that wasnt so bad was it? I raved, reflected and dedicated. Hurrah for my first blog!  Adios,  A freshly laundered me.

      You: Snigger Snigger Me: Mutter mutter  yeah..i DID pay money to watch the village - spent more time waiting for a refund than at the theatre, I can tell you that! In hindsight, the movie could've worked if was played in the theatre in reverse. There are formulas of scary movies that shouldnt be messed around with - they should be left just so. Had just settled into seat and had finally taken control of popcorn when lo and behold! titles appear.. I laugh encouragingly - horror movie..get it? whats more horrorsome than the titles when the movie should be picking up speed and is off at full-throttle towards climax? So I sit and snigger at those who leave the theatre murmering -bah, what would they know of modern horror movies. I soon am escorted out in shameful disgrace - apparently was in the way of the cleaning crew who were instructed to clean the place AFTER THE MOVIE ENDED! refund idea was laughed upon by management - didnt help when I pointed out that I was cheated out of a scary movie. But then M.night shyamalan did what I always wanted to -sell a packet of nothing..  Think about it - there is no rule that forbids me from selling a packet of nothing. For fancy effects i could fill it up with air, but is basically nothing inside. So here we have a fancy wrapper, with kids and cartoons or sexy women depending on my target audience (am market savvy mind you). Packet can open like a milk carton, or like a chips packet, depending on if you got the regular or special variant. But the final effect remains the same - there is nothing in the packet. No rule against doing this is there, and i dont exactly fool the audience. If my wrapper says there is zero fat and zero carbs inside- is nothing but the wholesome truth. Hell, I could even have a website promoting the product's future launches - scented air filled in it instead of plain air. The buyer shall purchase a packet (Warning: open pack for contents), proceed to reach in for contents, gaze in puzzlement at empty packet. Then he (in my feminist sense, women dont experiment with unknown products like so) shall turn it upside down, realize the fraud, laugh appreciatively at sense of humor and proceed to throw it in the garbage. A second scenario could also be that he purchases many more with the wrong assumption that he recieved a faulty product. Either way, he buys the first packet - leading me to a well-earned profit for a quirky sense of humor and business. In an idiotic world, he would return for any other product by my company - the same as one shall return for M.night's next movie. In an idiotic world, my friend, in an idiotic world.   Well, reunion with friends was eventful. Heard about paranormal experiences with the utmost solemn interest. Lesson learnt: If one were to speak to one's deceased parent via a communicator (read: possessed human) one shall oversee fact that one speaks to one's father in a language that father doth not understand. For simpler story, read on.  Atsuko believes in the paranormal. Snigger on as you may, raise that untrimmed eyebrow if you wish, but that is the truth. The earlier you accept it without pointless debates, the easier for me to continue the story. Thank you. So the lady hops along lah-dee-dah to San Diego for an encounter of the paranormal kind. I dont know how one approaches this dainty task though. Does one say " I wish to speak umm..to a paranormal person" ? In anycase, she enters a swanky home to speak to Mother Donna (names changed to protect identity - whose identity though? hers or her paranormal business partners? hush hush) So atsuko proceeds to speak to a heavily middle-eastern accented eeeebraheeem. He proceeds to tell her, in her own words, answers to what she wanted to ask! Hallelujah, you say? Caution - he does not answer questions that he knows you dont want really want to ask. Questions such as  - how many marbles in my pocket or how many cops waiting outside to nab you. HUSSSSHHHH i say!!  To proceed on - she expresses wish to speak to her father -a japanese dead person. "yessssss" assures mother donna. Except when father dearest begins to speak, is in heavily japanese accented english. "It was a bit strange" atsuko admitted to us later "he answered in a strangely tibetian accented english". Alla and me exchange sly looks, but Julia gives us the stern eye to comfort her "but tibet is somewhere near japan, eeesnt it" she asks. "it might as well be" replies geo-challenged atusko "but dad cannot speak english". Alla and me continue to smother ourselves from giggling as julia comforts her the way only she can "oh atsukooo..dont worry, maybe poppa wants you to learn better english"...Atsuko nods wisely as she totters off..NOW can i snigger???   paranormally  hushhhh....
