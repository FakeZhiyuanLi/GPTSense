						   Thank you to all for a lovely Summercomes ceremony and a huge congrats to students for their very impressive collection of academic and 'school spirit' awards. Wow! What a super group of talented individuals. A very special and humongous and thank you goes to our wonderful faculty and staff, without whose efforts, the set up and execution of the day could not have gone so beautifully. Thank you for your hard work. It was a lovely morning.

						   Next Wednesday and Thursday, your teachers have some wonderfully fun activities planned that will take you off campus for each of the two days. You will leave at 8:30 and return at 2:45. On Wednesday, there are two trips planned...a middle school trip and a high school trip. On Thursday, teachers have planned a Superfunday during which the entire school will take a ride over to Cochituate State Park in Natick for a day of fun activities. Stay tuned for the list of things to do. Then, on Friday... our last day of school, we shall have an opportunity to watch the beginning of the take down of Phoneix. Beginning on  TUESDAY ONLY , students may take 5 minutes at the end of their class in Phoenix to write a message(s) to write a message on the walls of the building (inside, not out!) It must be clean, positive and appropriate. If it's not, it will be scratched out with an indelible marker. If you don't have a class in Phoneix, you may write during break.

						   Don't forget, today is the rehearsal for the talent show. You'll need the music, props, costumes etc. etc. for your act.  IF YOU DON'T HAVE THESE, YOU CANNOT BE IN THE TALENT SHOW!  If you forgot these and cannot be in the talent show. I'm sorry. But don't forget, there is always next year's talent show, and there might be plenty new talent and you can rehearse your act with your new friends next year.

						   The school boat trip aboard the  Spirit of Boston . The food was great, but this just opinion, the music wasn't that great. However, the sunset was beautiful. I have pictures which I'll scan later. Some kids danced, others walked around the decks, other just and watched the sea, the boats, or people. Judy would like thank the students and teachers.

						   Today, the tours of the new building were held, and I must say, it looks pretty good. The gym is practically finished, as the work crew are laying down the school emblem and will paint it today. We have seen the new library, science room, the commons, and a typical classroom. The computer lab isn't finished yet. I'd say the school looks good except for the unfinished rooms, which have some wires hanging from the ceiling, but I'm sure that will be fixed by the next two weeks. Oh yes, as an extra surprise... Phoenix will torn down on the last day!! Yay! Now... If I only had some C4 and a detonator.  For information on the new school buliding  urlLink click here

						   Tomorrow is Friday as you know and will be periods 5-8 and the usual adviser period or meeting. Well maybe it's not that usual, as Judy will be holding a meeting for people going on the boat trip/dance/prom during that time in the Gym (Porter). Also tomorrow, there will be tours once again of the new building (No Name Yet, I'll just call it the Barn, even though this is the first I've called it that.) That's pretty much it and have a good and safe boat trip/prom/dance/whatever etc. etc. etc.

						   Hello, I'm Patrick Mannion and this is the  Willow Hill School Blog ... acutally, I'm thinking of changing the name to  The Willow Branch Online  or something like that. Anyways, this is my fourth blog... but hopefully, I will not be doing this by myself. I already have three blogs as it is... I don't want to do a fourth one.... so hopefully, I can get you guys, my fellow students to help me... Anyways, I hope you like the layout, it's a template called 'Scribe' and it's a slightly edited version by me, becuase I removed the "About Me" section. I don't like that much personally. Anyways, on to the first story!

      That's right... I have made the decision to allow the provinces to post Level 2 and 3 sex offenders. Level 2 Sex Offenders will be shown by the amount of how many are in the community, however, the community police are allowed to Level 2 sex offenders name and addresses if nesscary. Level 3 sex offenders will receive their own profile page with a history of past crimes committed by them. However, this service is a public service and if used for abuse, criminal activities, threats or harassment will be dealt with harsh fines and a prison term.

      After reading some recommndations. I have decided to create three new tools for the "War on Terror." First of all, is the Cabinet-level Director of National Intelligence which will be head of the National Intelligence Authority. Second are two new centers, the Nationial Counterterrorism Center and the National Crisis Mangement Center or Op-Center. We have yet to name a Director.

      Yes, we two nations have signed a non-agression treaty. We will promise not use any nuclear against each other. This was a response to yesterday's post which Edenburg misunderstood by mistake, but it will now lead to better relations.

      I have declared  urlLink sanctions again Angolistica  for attempting to trade weapons of mass destruction (specifically biological) and manufacturing. I will however let them continue to compete in the Med Games. These sanctions will not be revoked until the The United Socialist States of Angolistica agree to these terms. They will however be allowed to keep the weapons that were manufactured as long as the are never used again unless absolutely necssary.

      Well, I finally come up with something to write after having this window open for at least 4 hours and nothing written. But now I have. Over the last few days, intelligence has come out that The United Socialist States of Angolistica, propsed a trade with The Kingdom of Edenburg for biologicial weapons. Edenburg however, declined and was just as shocked. This alarms me greatly, Freedomstaki will not stand for this. As everyone knows of the  urlLink Sahara Crisis , in which one of our low-yield nuclear weapons went off in the Sahara near The Republic of Tripolis, which sadly led to sanctions against us. The general in charge of this silo conviced his second in command with the other key that, that part was unocciuped and this was a rountine above ground testing, which acutally in pratice has not taken place since 1995. Anyways, Freedomstaki has today since frowned upon these actions of trading of WMDs or using them. I propsed to the UN, the Neutron Bomb Act which would remove low-yield nuclear weapons. Also, some actions agianst WMDs were acted upon the region, but I believe we need more. We need a Mediterranean version of the The Stuttgart Treaty. This could help ensure a long-lasting peace in the Mediterranean for maybe at least the next 50 years. Not only will this include nuclear weapons, but biological and chemicals weapons as well due the recent trading by Angolistica. This may even go further to prevent other weapons such as a Space Weapons Platform, such as in the fictional movie  GoldenEye .   I will write more about this later. That is all for now.

      Man. I hurt so bad. I fell off the steps of the Executive Trailer on vacation this morning feeding the dog. I cut my elbow a bit and it's sore. That's pretty much it except for my butt that's all. Took to the boat for a spin. Wrote down some stuff to be recomenended for the legislature. That's pretty much for it today, except for the news that the Freedomstaki Spirit traded Nomar.

Padraig Mannion, the Taoiseach of Freedomstaki, this is new age, 21st cnetury equivlent of weekly radio address, but now it's daily or even hourly, or whenever I feel like it or remember it.
