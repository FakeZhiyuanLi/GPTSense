      Always forgive your enemies - Nothing annoys them so much.  If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends?  When everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane.   I used to have an open mind but my brains kept falling out.  I couldn't repair your brakes, so I made your horn louder.  For Sale: Parachute. Only used once, never opened, small stain.  Do you have trouble making up your mind? Well, yes or no?  If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.  Many people quit looking for work when they find a job.  When I'm not in my right mind, my left mind gets pretty crowded.  Everyone has a photographic memory.  Some just don't have film.   You know the speed of light, so what's the speed of dark?  Join The Army, Visit exotic places, meet strange people, then kill them.  I poured Spot remover on my dog. Now he's gone.  Evening news is where they begin with 'Good evening', and then proceed to tell you why it isn't.  Before borrowing money from a friend, decide which you need more.(Friend or Money !)  Death is hereditary.  There are three sides to any argument: your side, my side and the right side.  An consultant is someone who takes a subject you understand and makes it sound confusing.  Never argue with a fool. People might not know the difference.  When you're right, no one remembers. When you're wrong, no one forgets.  Cheer up, the worst is yet to come.  Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.  Everyone makes mistakes. The trick is to make mistakes when nobody is looking.  They say hard work never hurts anybody, but why take the chance.  Always borrow money from a pessimist.  He won't expect it back.  I like work.  It fascinates me.  I  sit and look at it for hours.  If you can't see the bright side of life, polish the dull side.  Where there's a will, there are five hundred relatives.  Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die.

      For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin--real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.-- Alfred D. Souza   In the book of life every page has two sides: we human beings fill the upper side with our plans, hopes and wishes, but providence writes on the other side, and what it ordains is seldom our goal. -- Nisami   Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment. -- Buddha   It is not length of life, but depth of life. -- Ralph Waldo Emerson   In the game of life it's a good idea to have a few early losses, which relieves you of the pressure of trying to maintain an undefeated season. -- Bill Baughan   The tragedy of life is not that it ends so soon, but that we wait so long to begin it. -- Anonymous   Expecting life to treat you well because you are a good person is like expecting an angry bull not to charge because you are a vegetarian.-- Shari R. Barr   Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. -- Anonymous   Life is a great big canvas, and you should throw all the paint on it you can. -- Danny Kaye   And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.-- Abraham Lincoln

      Most people I talk to that love pirates or are obsessed with them believe that pirates should not be hung. I on the other hand believe if caught for piracy, then yes they should be hanged. For as I see it, if people weren't hanged for piracy then just about anyone would become a pirate. Without the threat of being hanged, piracy could be as easy as buying food at the store. Therefore, it would then become something even the most shy and chickenish person would do. But with the threat of hanging, only the most roughest and best would be a pirate. So I conclude this with the fact that I am all for pirates being hanged, maybe even me.  P.S. For those that read this please keep in mind that I'm talking of the piracy in the 1500-1700's, not internet piracy, of course.

      Misty  My name is Misty I am but three, My eyes are swollen I cannot see, I must be stupid, I must be bad, What else could have Made my Daddy so mad?   I wish I were better I wish I weren't ugly Then maybe my Mommy Would still want to hug me. I can't speak at all I can't do a wrong Or else I'm locked up All the day long.  When I awake I'm all alone The house is dark My folks are not home When my mommy does come I'll try and be nice, So maybe I'll get just One whipping tonight.   Don't make a sound, I just heard a car My daddy is back From Charlie's Bar. I hear him curse My name he calls I press myself Against the wall   I try and hide From his evil eyes I'm so afraid now  I'm starting to cry He finds me weeping He shouts ugly words, He says its my fault  That he suffers at work.   He slaps me and hits me And yells at me more, I finally get free  And I run for the door. He's already locked it And I start to bawl, He takes me and throws me Against the hard wall. I fall to the floor With my bones nearly broken, And my daddy continues With more bad words spoken.  "I'm sorry!", I scream  But its now much too late  His face has been twisted Into unimaginable hate The hurt and the pain  Again and again Oh please God, have mercy! Oh please let it end!  And he finally stops  And heads for the door, While I lay there motionless  Sprawled on the floor  My name is Misty And I am but three, Tonight my daddy  Murdered me.   I for one am and always will be against child abuse.  -Beni

       Aye, for Martial Fashion Tips, ye came to the right place! (Hell, Lassy,this be the right place for "Marital" Fashion Tips, too, but we'll worryabout that later!)So many neophyte pirates ask me, "Cap'n Slappy, Where do I put me sword?"or "How do I wear me brace o' pistols?" or "How often should I change mebritches?" and it just makes an old sea dog such as meself smile thatcharming whimsical smile what makes even the hardest trollop melt.So, here's me advice - wear it however it pleases ye to wear it and ifsome meddlin' know-it-all o' a sea scamp says, "That's not wear yercutlass goes!" Whisk it from its place with blinding spontenaity, jab itdeep into his belly and ask, "Is it better there?" Rip it from it'sabdominal scabbard and wipe the blade on his shirt before he drops thenreturn it to wherever it is ye like to wear it. Cleanliness is importantafter all.No one will ever question your personal style again!    -Cap'n Slappy

      Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3   Following the phenomenal success of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl, Disney are planning two sequels to be filmed back-to-back. According to reports, all of the principal cast members and director Gore Verbinski have indicated that they'll be interested in signing up if the scripts are good enough. Disney are hoping to secure the services again of Pirates' scriptwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Filming is unlikely to begin before late 2004 or early 2005.

      School brings lots of positive thing back for me. Like, I get to see my friends more often, and I will have better things to do with my time. It also brings homework and knowing I have to try harder on school work. It also means I means I must yet again rise up to my parents expectations. Many hate going back to school, but I just see it as another opportunity to gain friendship and knowledge. DO you hate going back to school or do you like going back to school? E-mail me at:  urlLink spitfirebabe926@netscape.net  with your answer to that question.

      OK - Let's just say for a moment you bunch of pampered, overpaid, unrealistic childrenhad your way and the U.S.A. didn't go into Iraq.  Let's say that you really get your way and we destroy all our nuclear weapons and stick daisies in our gun barrels and sit around with some white wine and cheese and pat ourselves on the back,so proud of what we've done for world peace.  Let's say that we cut the military budget tojust enough to keep the National Guardon hand to help out with floods and fires.  Let's say that we close down our military bases all over the world and bring the troops home, increase our foreign aid and drop all the trade sanctions against everybody.I suppose that in your fantasy world this would create a utopian world where everybody would live in peace.  After all, the great monster, the United States of America, the cause of all the world's troublewould have disbanded it's horrible militaryand certainly all the other countries of the world would follow suit.  After all, they only arm themselves to defend their countries from the mean old U.S.A.Why you bunch of pitiful, hypocritical,idiotic, spoiled mugwumps. Get your head out of the sand and smell the Trade Towers burning.  Do you think that a trip to Iraq by Sean Penn did anything but encourage a wanton murderer to think that the people of the U.S.A. didn't have the nerve or the guts to fight him?  Barbra Streisand's fanatical and hateful rankings about George Bush makes about as much sense as Michael Jackson hanging a baby over a railing.  You people need to get out of Hollywoodonce in a while and get out into the real world. You'd be surprised at the hostility you would find out here.  Stop in at a truck stop and tell an overworked, long distance truck driver that you don't think Saddam Hussein is doing anything wrong.  Tell a farmer with a couple of sons in the military that you think the United Stateshas no right to defend itself.Go down to Baxley, Georgia and hold an anti-war rally and see what the folks down there think about you.You people are some of the most disgusting examples of a waste of protoplasm I've everhad the displeasure to hear about.  Sean Penn, you're a traitor to the United States of America. You gave aid and comfort to the enemy. How many American lives will your little, "fact finding trip" to Iraq cost? You encouraged Saddam to thinkthat we didn't have the stomach for war.  You people protect one of the most evil menon the face of this earth and won't lift a finger to save the life of an unborn baby.Freedom of choice you say?  Well I'm going to exercise some freedom of choice of my own.If I see any of your names on a marquee,I'm going to boycott the movie. I will completely stop going to movies if I have to.In most cases it certainly wouldn't be much of a loss.  You scoff at our military whose boots you're not even worthy to shine.  They go to battle and risk their lives so ingrates like you can live in luxury.The day of reckoning is coming when you will be faced with the undeniable truth that the war against Saddam Hussein is the war on terrorism.  America is in imminent danger.You're either for her or against her.  There is no middle ground. I think we all know where you stand.  What do you think? God Bless America!

      I hope you are specifically singled out for the next terrorist incident that this country sees. We all know that another attack or wave of attacks is imminent and I can only pray that you are the target, for you are doing nothing but endangering the lives of more Americans.  An old saying comes to mind: United we stand, divided we fall. If you, in your simple naivety, are so sure that fighting for our way of life is wrong, then by all means voice your opinion in a positive, non-destructive way. The way of life that allows you to make an ass of yourself in the streets of America also allows you to run for public office and elect the public officials who you think will best represent the populous.  If you truly wanted to further your cause of peace, why didn't you protest our war in Afghanistan? Why didn't you protest our various endeavors in Iraq, Africa and Eastern Europe during the Clinton administration? Why didn't you protest our action in Panama or our "war on drugs"? The truth of the matter is that peace is not gained through words alone but the road to peace and democracy is paved only with the blood, sweat and tears of those willing to die for the freedom of others.  Understand this: your protesting, your blocking of our streets, your occupation of our cities resources, and your rape of the first amendment is not helping to spread peace nor increase the safety of the American people, but rather it is causing the opposite. Our police are so busy keeping the peace with peace protesters (ironic, no?) that terrorists might as well come on in and do as they please. After the events of September 11th, 2001, I can only assume that we would want to put all possible resources into keeping our cities safe, but your protests are hindering that. So ultimately in my mind, if there was to be another attack, I can only hope it is against the people who are essentially allowing it to happen.  Our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, relatives, friends, heroes and idols are dispersed throughout the planet as we speak fighting for the freedom of others, feeding the poor, defending the helpless and keeping peace all in the name of humanity and you should be ashamed for protesting against them. I'm sick and tired of hearing the excuse from you protestors that you are not against the coalition forces, but against the war they are fighting. Although this is a much better stance than the protestors of the sixties who acted appallingly towards our soldiers coming home from Vietnam, I firmly believe that causing civil unrest in the name of "peace" does nothing but demoralize our soldiers who are valiantly serving us across the world.  Protesting a war on an evil, murdering tyrant whose government is responsible for more atrocities that are countable or even worth recounting is the same as showing support for said tyrant. When you show your disgust for our government's actions in trying to overthrow his regime, you are showing your support for him.  My last message is this: think twice before going out to the cities of America with the soul purpose of disrupting the commutes of your hardworking neighbors in hopes of getting on TV with your clever signs and ridiculous behavior. Is your stopping traffic in the middle of the city and playing dead in front of office buildings actually going to bring peace to the world? No, no it is not. I'm not saying that individuals or groups of people cannot effect change in the world, but I think the way the American protestors are trying to do this is a waste of time and taxpayers money.  Show your patriotism by writing to the officials elected by you or even better by running for political office, not by skipping work or school and clogging up America's streets with the intention of showing off your divisive, non-constructive childish behavior.  Regards, Chris M.

        urlLink     Please look at link before you read, has photo: urlLink http://www.morton.wednet.edu/mhs/clubs/Alicia-Marine_memorial.JPG   Six Boys and a FlagHave you ever seen the bronze statue or seen a picture of the statue of the 6 marine soldiers raising the US flag? It is in Washington DC. It is the Marine Memorial.  The statue is based on a picture taken during the second world war, in 1945, and these 6 boys are planting the flag on top of the highest mountain in Iwo Jima after a fierce 27 day battle.  Iwo Jima is a small island south of Japan in the midst of the Pacific Ocean. It was closer to Japan than any island the US military forces had captured up to that date, and the island's capture helped prepare the way for the final campaign against the Japanese mainland to help end the war. The fight was one of the most vicious and intense in that entire war.  The raising of the flag signified the victory of the US marines.  Each year I am hired to go to Washington, DC, with the eighth grade class from Clinton, WI., where I grew up, to videotape their trip. I greatly enjoy visiting our nation's capitol, and each year I take some special memories back with me.  This fall's trip was especially memorable. On the last night of our trip,we stopped at the Iwo Jima memorial. This memorial is the largest bronzestatue in the world and depicts one of the most famous photographs inhistory--that of the six brave soldiers raising the American Flag at thetop of a rocky hill on the island of Iwo Jima, Japan, during WW II.  Over one hundred students and chaperones piled off the buses and headedtowards the memorial. I noticed a solitary figure at the base of thestatue, and as I got closer he asked, "Where are you guys from?" I told him that we were from Wisconsin. "Hey, I'm a Cheesehead, too! Come gather around, Cheeseheads, and I will tell you a story."  (James Bradley just happened to be in Washington, DC, to speak at thememorial the following day. He was there that night to say goodnight! tohis dad, who has since passed away. He was just about to leave when hesaw the buses pull up. I videotaped him as he spoke to us, and received hispermission to share what he said from my videotape. It is one thing totour the incredible monuments filled with history in Washington, D.C., but it is quite another to get the kind of insight we received that night.)When all had gathered around, he reverently began to speak.(Here are his words that night.)  "My name is James Bradley and I'm from Antigo, Wisconsin. My dad ison that statue, and I just wrote a book called "Flags of Our Fathers" which is #5 on the New York Times Best Seller list right now. It is the story of the six boys you see behind me. Six boys raised the flag."  "The first guy putting the pole in the ground is Harlon Block. Harlonwas an all-state football player. He enlisted in the Marine Corps withall the senior members of his football team. They were off to play another type of game. A game called "War." But it didn't turnout to be a game. Harlon, at the age of 21, died with his intestines in his hands.  I don't say that to gross you out, I say that because there are generalswho stand in front of this statue and talk about the glory of war. Youguys need to know that most of the boys in Iwo Jima were 17, 18, and 19 years old."(He pointed to the statue) "You see this next guy? That's Rene Gagnonfrom New Hampshire. If you took Rene's helmet off at the moment thisphoto was taken and looked in the webbing of that helmet, you would find a photograph ...a photograph of his girlfriend. Rene put that in therefor protection because he was scared. He was 18 years old. Boys won thebattle of Iwo Jima. Boys. Not old men."  "The next guy here, the third guy in this tableau, was sergeant MikeStrank. Mike is my hero. He was the hero for all these guys. They calledhim the "old man" because he was so old. He was already 24. When Mikewould motivate his boys in training camp, he didn't say, 'Let's go kill someJapanese', or 'Let's die for our country.' He knew he was talking to little boys. Instead he would say, 'You do what I say, and I'll get you home to your mothers.""The last guy on this side of the statue is Ira Hayes, a Pima Indian from Arizona. Ira Hayes walked off Iwo Jima. He went into the White Housewith my dad. President Truman told him, 'You're a hero.' He told reporters, 'How can I feel like a hero when 250 of my buddies hit the island with me and only 27 of us walked off alive?"  "So you take your class at school, 250 of you spending a year togetherhaving fun, doing everything together. Then all 250 of you hit the beach,but only 27 of your classmates walk off alive. That was Ira Hayes. Hehad images of horror in his mind. Ira Hayes died dead drunk, face down at the age of 32 ...ten years after this picture was taken.""The next guy, going around the statue, is Franklin Sousley from Hilltop, Kentucky. A fun-lovin' hillbilly boy. His best friend, who is now 70, told me, 'Yeah, you know, we took two cows up on the porch of the Hilltop General Store. Then we strung wire across the stairs so the cows couldn't get down. Then we fed them Epsom salts. Those cows crapped all night.' Yes, he was a fun-lovin' hillbilly boy. Franklin died on Iwo Jima at the age of 19."  "When the telegram came to tell his mother that he was dead, it went to the Hilltop General Store. A barefoot boy ran that telegram up to his mother's farm. The neighbors could hear her scream all night and intothe morning. The neighbors lived a quarter of a mile away." "The next guy, as we continue to go around the statue, is my dad, JohnBradley from Antigo, Wisconsin, where I was raised. My dad lived until1994, but he would never give interviews. When Walter Cronkite'sproducers, or the New York Times would call, we were trained as littlekids to say, 'No, I'm sorry, sir, my dad's not here. He is in Canada fishing. No, there is no phone there, sir. No, we don't know when he is coming back.' My dad never fished or even went to Canada. Usually, he was sitting there right at the table eating his Campbell's soup. But we hadto tell the press that he was out fishing. He didn't want to talk to thepress. ""You see, my dad didn't see himself as a hero. Everyone thinks these guysare heroes, 'cause they are in a photo and a monument. My dad knewbetter. He was a medic. John Bradley from Wisconsin was a caregiver. In Iwo Jima he probably held over 200 boys as they died. And when boys died in Iwo Jima, they writhed and screamed in pain."  "When I was a little boy, my third grade teacher told me that my dadwas a hero. When I went home and told my dad that, he looked at me andsaid, 'I want you always to remember that the heroes of Iwo Jima are the guys who did not come back. Did NOT come back.'  "So that's the story about six nice young boys. Three died on Iwo Jima,and three came back as national heroes. Overall, 7,000 boys died on IwoJima in the worst battle in the history of the Marine Corps.""My voice is giving out, so I will end here. Thank you for your time."  Suddenly, the monument wasn't just a big old piece of metal with a flagsticking out of the top. It came to life before our eyes with the heartfeltwords of a son who did indeed have a father who was a hero. Maybe not ahero for the reasons most people would believe, but a hero nonetheless!  We need to remember that God created this vast and glorious worldfor us to live in, freely, but also at great sacrifice. Let us never forgetfrom the revolutionary War to the Gulf War and all the wars in between that sacrifice was made for our freedom.Remember to pray praises for this great country of ours and also pray forthose still in murderous unrest around the world.  STOP and thank God forbeing alive and being free at someone else's sacrifice. God Bless.  REMINDER: Everyday that you can wake up free,it's going to be a great day!
