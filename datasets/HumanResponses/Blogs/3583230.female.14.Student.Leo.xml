      Well today was fun! I went to a party and ya. My sister left for spain yesterday adn this morning i got bored so i went through her room.  I don't get how she can be so perfect! It is just downright unnatural! Oh ya! A big thanks to alex since I decided to make one of these for myslef after he got one.  These are actually quite nifty.  O speakin of that my fave words are nifty spiffy despurce (sp.. just a hint i could not spell for my life)and so many more i jsut cant list them all.  I am so excited Chronicles of Riddick comes out on the 11th!  I am very very very bored right now. well thats all for now.

      I jsut finished watchin You Got Served.  Its not too shaby. Oh yes shaby, another one of my fave words. MY attempts to start skateboarding have failed.  I still suck and am considering giving it up again.  I have also decicded on what i want for a graduation gift.  $100 worth of my fave movies. So far I have SLC Punk.  I cant think of any otehrs i really wana own right now. I am soooooooo bored and there is nothing to do.  There's 1 month and 27 days till my b day! Yay! I find it rather interesting if you give your parents more info than they really need that they have total trust in you. So I say B.S. is in the details.  You wana do something you know you arent allowed to give your parents all the details possible that wont get you in trouble adn they are completely oblivious.  Something thats bugging me right now is the fact that my sister is such adn angel it is jsut unnatural... i know i have talked about this already tho.  There is nothing that she has done wrong accept maybe kissing a guy at a party during truth or dare.  Wow that is scary.  She doesnt use drugs and trys to persuade people that do use to stop, she gets strate A's and has only gotten one B since like 5th grade, does so much volunteer wrok you wonder how she has time for anything else, and oh she is a perfect daughter.  Now you tell me waht is unnatural about that.  Wells that was fun.  Now I am off to find something on tv or maybe watch pitch black or almost famous o! or maybe teh matrix... who else thinks the first one was the best adn only good one?

      One of the funniest songs ever.. by: Stepehn Lynch.......................................   I came down to the breakfast table felt like I could die Tried so hard but wasn't able  to look you in the eye .........................................................  For i'm feeling so much shame yes i have brought disgrace i can tell i've soiled my good name by the look upon your face ...........................................................  Well it seems last night you caught me spankin it No use denyin it I was really crankin it Well Dry your eyes don't be so sad If you could just forgive me and talk to me, dad talk to me dad ..............................................................  I didn't hear ya enter, no I didn't hear the door with my hand upon my member and my pants upon the floor Now burnt into your brain is an image you dispise like blood and guts and starvin kids and Stevie Wonder's eyes ............................................................... . Well it seems last night you caught me spankin it No use denyin it I was really crankin it Well Dry your eyes don't be so sad but I wouldn't use those tissues They've already been had Talk to me dad ..............................................................  The look upon your face made my swollen gland diminish So I said, "Could ya close the door? I really wanna finish" Now daddy I'm ashamed and I'd completely understand If you never wanna hug again or even shake my hand .............................................................  Well it seems last night you caught me spankin it No use denyin it I was really crankin it Well Dry your eyes don't be so sad Just because it was your bed  It's not that bad ...............................................................  When I was only seventeen, you told me it was dirty, so it must be really creepy when your kid is pushin thirty But you cannot tell me dad that you have never had a whack At the thing that hangs below your belt and bumps into your sack ................................................................  Well it seems last night you caught me spankin it No use denyin it I was really crankin it Well Dry your eyes don't be so sad But I wouldn't use those tissues they've already been- just because it was your bed it's not that-  now daddy daddy please forgive me and talk to me dad talk to me dad

      Well I am back... I havent had much to talk about accept well all my trips to the movies in the past few days and things like that.  Oke well lets see I think i will tell you about my first movie trip... I went to get dinner with Erinn and Lex at CPK that was an interesting meal... while we were waiting to be seated we went a book sotre and i baught tarot cards... so after that we ate and we got some pretty strange looks from people at the other tables... that was interesting.. then we headed off to the movie where we met up with stefan but wait.. i cant remember what movie we saw... plz hold one moment while i ask erinn...... ooooooooooo ya! Shrek 2... interesting movie that was errrrr Puss in boots.... OOOOOOOO Shrek likes the pussy!  I shouldnt of said that :/  :0  get teh joke?  Well at the movie i saw casey and carolyn adn their friends.. carolyn threw popcorn and a penney at us...  so the movie was rather hilarious... and then at the end stefan and lex went home.. and erinns mom circled the block twice while waiting for my father to show up.... and wen i got home casey imed me ad started bugging me about the fact i was wit a guy adn casey was acting very jealouse it was reeeeeeeaaaaaaaaalllllllly funny... and that concludes that story leaving out teh scary tarot cards..         Then the next time we went to the movie we were goin to see dogeball but it sold out and like i told erinn they checked tickets on entering that theater.. so we saw the terminal instead it was quite funny... ethan came along and he was short as usual and got in for kids price... thats about it for that..         o then before bothe of these visits to the movies... i went to see stepford wives with casey and carolyn... that was interesting.... they both attacked me...           well to sum this all up i am have been watching alot of movie lately... i find it really strange how i barely talked to erinn the whole 3 years i was at St. M and then now that we are out and all of a suddon we r friends and hang out alot.. its kool how that kinda thing happens although very strange..

Just give up and stop trying!!!!! arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggg!!!  Everything has to b sooo complicated.. omg u did this so now i hate u! or omg can u believe this!!!!! or well since i am so n so's friend i cant b yors.. even tho i said i would even if u did wat u did? god people where the hell does it end!!!!!!!!?????Our race is jsut sooooooo evil to eachother.. and trust me i am not jsut pointing fingers at u.. i no i can b evil and nasty and i realise this and i am not denying it...  But god.. its all lets see how many people can we step on to reach that one goal! but wait do i evne no wat that goal is..? (example of thoguhts in a humans subconcious mind)  I have decided to quit hiding anything! and i erge u people to do it too... the human race jsut destroys.. sure we can b good.. all nice or lets save the earth or i baked u cookies ow w/e but thats jsut one side.. and that side isnt seen much.. this world is just to f***ed up!  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   ok.. now moving on to my mind how it works and maybe help you people figure out me a bit better.. b cuz probubly wat u think i am is not even close... my mind plays mind games on my mind... it makes me go nuts.. but also.. i have read so many books and met all these diff. characters through these books that the ones i like or think are cool i take them upon myself and make them one of my many diff faces... or atleast thats wat my mind tell my my mind.. iono if that is jsut another character in my mind.. but so out of all this... i have lost who i  really am since i am apart of so many other things.. i really dont no who i am.. like what i am writing now i dont no if this is really me or my minf trying to make me sounds like one of those characters i took on as my own....  also my mind is like split.. happy hyper chiild and depressed angry badass suicidal side... neither i no if that is really me or jsut an act or they r both me.. but like i can have to worst day and b all happy and b like well theres always tom.. and go look at hott movie stars online or i can have the best day adn go home.. start thinking and get all depressed and suicidal.. o u guys didnt know? ya.. and that depressed.. thinking life is not worth it thing i know isnt an act.. and tehn that gets me thinking.. is that really me then? but i still dont know.. i dont no wat else to write cuz i have said so much and yet it seems like its all the same thing said diff. ways.. i dont no if i should post this either.. i am not sure of the response.. but to hell wit it i am gunna post this which u no i did sine u r reading this.. but ya... pretty much.. i give up on trying to fit in.. i give up on hoping people like me or people hate me... i give up... its not worth the effort.. so i am gunna stop tying this go bak online and carry on my life... and hope you people get me a little better.. or if this jsut confused u.. mayb that was the impression u needed about me.. so i leave you for now

      Well i got my schedual... errrr..1-art/miller  s1 + s2 health/anibale, 2-algebra/newsom, 3-religion/hodges, 4-world civ/roth, 5-english/schoen, 6-spanish/cervantes.. it just seems so final.. and this has made me slip back into depression.. jsut cause i am not sure what i really want.. its like errrrr... wen i think back.. i was a happy lil kid K-5th then i was even excited bout goin to st. m.. wow did that change once i got there... i cried myself to sleep evey night.. i had a chance to change skools.. or atleast my mom said if i really wanted it bad enough i could.. but i didnt.. A) cuz i was scared to.. B) i wasnt sure what high skool i wanted to go to so if i stayed i could keep my options open.. C) st m was easier....so i stayed.. and i think i am happy bout that choice.. sorta... then in fifth grade my mom promised me i could choose what high school i wanted to go to if i went to st m... well that was total BS.. i told her i wasnt sure i wanted to go to CHS wen i got ym acceptance letter.. and.. and she said we'd talk bout it.. but we never did.. and i never braught it up since iw as still unsure and am still unsure till this very minute.. so enrollment came around.. and i was enrolled.. did my mother ever ask me if i wanted to go? never.. hmmm... well isnt that interesting.. so today i got my schedual.. and it jsut seems so so so final.. and i still dont no what i wana do.. and it totally sux!.. but i guess i will brave CHS.. and if i cant do it i'll transfer...Not to mention.. my freinds factor has completely changed... and now has no affect on either place i would wana go..( yet another thing that bothers me.. not that it changed.. but the reason y it changed).. so ya.. now i am all sad and upset jsut cuz wen i think .. i get that way.. and it isnt good.. and then all this reminds me of a poem i wrote like sometime during 8th grade.. i think.. so here it is:  She Had Changed  Happy as a child was she, Happy about friends, Happy with her family, Happy with her life, Then a change came along, Now there was no happiness, Worried about her friends, Unhappy with her family, Scared to wake up each day, She left her friends and met new people, Not one she met liked her though, Alone she was almost every day, Seeing her old friends every chance she got, She stayed with her family but things did change, She grew older and wiser, She realized her family wasn’t all that loving, She realized her family wasn’t all that great, She slipped away from her family every chance she got, Then she got a chance to go back to her old life, She had the chance to be with her friends again, Or she could take a whole new life, Start all over and to be what ever she wanted to be, She wanted to go back to her friends, To be happy and care free, To not worry about the fights in her family, To look forward to each new day as an adventure again, She had to decide which path to take, Her old life, Or a new life full of questions and new opportunities, She wanted her old life more than anything, She could not go back to her old life though, She realized a scary thing, She wasn’t that little girl anymore, To many things had happened to her, She could not have her old life back, Because she had changed, Her friends did not get her decision, Her parents had never liked either path, She had to make the decision she made, She did not want a new life, For she could never have an entirely new life, Or be an entirely different person, She could not have her old life, For she was not the same person anymore, She took the only path there was, One she had not noticed before, The summer before high school, She took the path she had chose, She could never take back what she did, She didn’t have any choices to make any more, The path she chose, Although chosen selfishly and sad, Was the one she had to take, For it was the only right choice she had, She wrote a very nice letter, To her family and friends, Then she took her life, The night before school, For there was nothing left for her  kinda long eh?.. well ya.. now i am tired of typing.. but ya.. so i got a soccer tourny tom. sre hope we win.. heh ya right.. (im goaly).. but ya.. o n stefan comes bak tom.. i think.. so that will b kool.. o n i got my hair dyed.. it looks sooo kickass.. well thats it for now.. and heres where i leave u.. so until next time.. =~ Your's Truely

      Soccer and v ball camp have killed me.. i am surprised i am not asleep right now.. newasy.. i am takin quizes at quizzilla.. and i took this one quiz and i really liked the outcome.. the quiz is What Kind of Soul Do You Posses.... and here is teh answer...   You have a Lost Soul. No one is really sure what that can always mean, because it can be defined in many ways. As Legend goes, lost souls were the spirits of passed away people who are neither in heaven nor hell. They walk the earth, brooding mysteriously, always appearing when you expect it least. So hence, if you have a Lost Soul, then you are probably very insecure and shy. Stuck in your own little box, you watch the world fly by as a loner. You dont know your place. You seemingly dont have a place in society or an interest. You are a very capricious person, and are confused and frustrated about where you belong. You crave for the sense and feeling of home-but have not obtained it yet.   oo n heres anotehr i jsut took.. i liked this one too.. the title is.."Animal Spirit Guides ~ Which One Calls To You?"  The vision and hearing of Grandmother Owl is very powerful. Those with this medicine are can be gifted with the ability to see into the human psychic and become clairvoyant listeners. Owl often visits those who are teachers, therapists and counselors. As a guide, the owl teaches us to see and hear past shadows, beyond fear and darkness, though to the other side that promises light, happiness and knowledge. Owl's Wisdom Includes: Stealth Secrecy Silent and swift movement Seeing behind masks Keen sight Messenger of secrets and omens Shape-shifting Link between the dark, unseen world and the world of light Comfort with shadow self Moon magick Freedom The owl, whose large eyes peering through the darkness can see any deception. He is always wary of those who he does not feel completely close to (which is not many). The owl is a loner. Call on him if you think people are keeping the truth from you. He will be able to open your eyes.  O n according to another quiz.. i belong in the movie fight club.. i have taken that quiz twice at diff. times adn gotten the same answer.. hmm.. now i wana see the movie  haha! just took another quize... says im stoner bear!.. woot!(quiz title.. what care bear are you? or something like taht)  OO and another quiz says i am ever goth kids dream... hmmmm says alot eh?  neways.. ya.. im done.. soo THE END   wtf! another quiz said that i should die my hair blonde...:/ errrrr... it said i would probubly ditsy n evil.. uhhh
