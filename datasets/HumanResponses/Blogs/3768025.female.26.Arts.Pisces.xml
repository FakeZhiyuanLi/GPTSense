						   I live in the richest and most powerful country in the world. Our military is the biggest and most technologically advanced. The value of our currency regulates the world market. And I've spent a large portion of the day consuming Count Chocula cereal and watching TV. Apparently, I'm back in kindergarten.

						   My day always starts off really great. I have my cup of coffee with some cream, a smoke, maybe another smoke, I read the daily paper, I spend some quality time with the cat, sometimes I eat breakfast. The day continues to go well. I'll have a hearty bowel movement. The kind where I feel lighter and healthier for having had it. Then it's off to do some chores. Some errands. And I'm not really certain when it stops being a good day. Somewhere in the middle, I think. There's a point in time where I lose all of my morning ambition and delusions of grandeur. I don't know if it's after I watch the 112-pound two-year-olds on "Montel" or when I realize that half the day is gone and I've done nothing except secured myself a third or fourth cup of coffee. The dishes are still in the sink. I catch myself daydreaming about colored bath suds and being the lead bass guitarist in a blues band. And then it happens. I lose all of my energy and drive to conquer and then play with the world. Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

						   The  Christian Science Monitor  (where Science and Religion come together to prove that faith proves everything) is pleased to announce this latest unnerving news. It's the buzz of the "Just Say No" drug hate group and P.T.A.s all over the country. Right-wing radio talk show hosts and their irritatingly ignorant callers are claiming that they knew this all along but no one believed them before. Until Now. Some fanatics claim it's a conspiracy. Others fanatics say they agree with that. And still, many people are wondering if it is, indeed, true. If it's true that drugs make you gay.  "If that's the case," asks a staunch liberal, "why does it only affect 10 percent of the population?" No conservative wants to answer this question, because it may obviate the validity of the discovery. Many church-goers insist this is God's way of punishing those who break the law of the United States. "It's immoral what these kids are doing today," insists some man who is clearly judgmental. "Frankly, I'm glad it's happened. Doing drugs is wrong, but the punishment is so much worse." Of course, this outs many gays and lesbians who thought they'd already been out once before. "If this theory turns out to be completely correct, and even if it doesn't," exclaims one priest who volunteers at a boys' camp, "we can determine, by sexual orientation, who has done drugs. And then we can put the right people in prison."  Some neurologists and psychologists believe that the disclosure answers the question as to whether homosexuality is a choice or an inborn trait. "It's neither," reports a Washington Post columnist. "It's a side effect." However, Democratic "Hug a Tree" campaigner Milo Birnbaum posed a difficult challenge at a rally for helping to unionize the homeless: "The Monitor revealed that drugs make people homosexual. But they didn't say which drugs..." Thousands of Bush supporters insist that the drugs that make people gay are, most likely, the illicit ones. (George W Bush might be worried about these findings, whereas Bill Clinton can relax...)  And two weeks ago, the FDA issued a statement at a press conference held in the Carlyle in Washington D.C. "We were suspect of this hypothesis when it was first made public, but now we can say with 100 percent confidence that the evidence reveals illicit drugs aren't to blame. The makers of Tylenol products are." In the latest turn of events, the drug-induced homosexuality controversy is on the forebrains of Americans again. Apparently, acetominophen--the drug of choice for many with a slight headache, nothing more--is the "homo" culprit. "This is scandalous," says one woman. "I know plenty of women who use this drug to help them relax when giving birth. It's an outrage, really."

						   I hate M. Night Shyalaman. He needs to either stop making movies or hire a special-effects guy. For one thing, there is the movie "Signs." Besides being a horrible film with bad dialogue and a stupid plot, they never showed any alien life forms. We knew they were there, because everybody was afraid of them. We saw the faces of the horrified family when they came upon the aliens. We heard alien noises (not hard to do--just record a few sounds and play them backwards and then maybe throw in a bicycle horn to represent an alien screaming). I think people thought that the genius of Shyamalan was that he tried to create tension and suspense by leaving out the actual aliens, around whom the story was centered. ("How very Hitchcockesque of him, really!" I've heard them say.) I just think he was lazy. Filming people talking and carrying on about aliens is less complicated and expensive than showing the aliens. It's a cheap and petty cinematic trick. And because Shyamalan cut corners, I am deeply disgruntled. Thank you. Comment on this if you wish.

						    Stucturalist auteur theory, if I am correct, is based on the assumption, or rather the attitude, that the whole of a work of art is not the sum of its parts. Instead, each part (or term) is uniquely unto itself if and only if it creates and/or relates to a semblance of the organic whole. Each term is interdependent--independently unto itself--and depending upon the work as a whole, thereby contributing to its organic unity, continuity, and ingenuity.  --George W. Bush in speech delivered to Harvard Graduating Class of 2002    This is another ridiculous quote from the leader of the Free World. What WILL Bush say next? That the state of ketosis is contingent on the body producing an inordinate amount of organic compounds with each carbonyl group attached to two carbon atoms? Jesus. And this guy holds the highest elected office in America...

						   If you haven't seen "Fahrenheit 9/11," you'll be pleasingly surprised... If you willingly choose not to see the film, ask yourself in how many federal, state, and local elections you've voted and what you've done, as an American citizen, to enact legislative change in any capacity.

						     In case I haven't noticed (since i'm the only person who reads my journal), my entries are becoming more apoplectic. It's like a bowel fissure, only it's in my brain. I'm going to finally see Fahrenheit 9/11. I've seen the conspiracy movie at  urlLink Take Back the Media  so I know roughly what areas Moore is going to cover. I realize that the movie has been out for some time, but I am too lazy to wait in line when it's popular. If anyone accidentally comes across this blog (all visitations to my site, I believe, are purely coincidental and, in no way, reflect the populist content), please tell me what you thought of the movie--its faults, strong points, and holes. I'm a huge fan of Michael Moore, and I still think his best documentary was "Roger & Me." Terrifically touching film, and done on such a small budget. Also, please let me know how you're doing. It's good to hear directly from my constituents. Thank you, and I bid you a fondue.

						    Why do I write about myself? Why does anyone write about themselves?   I'll tell you why other people do it: to validate their pointless existences. I, on the other hand, write about myself so that others will feel sorry for me. And if they don't feel sorry for me, I'll never know. That's the real beauty of blog publishing. You get your ideas out into the world, and think you're a genius, all because you get no feedback. If blog publishers were a little more picky and choosey about who could end up with an online journal, I bet only a few people would have the balls to hold their little lives up to ridicule. But no--everyone does it. It's life imitating Reality TV.  The other day, I realized I was chewing wintergreen-flavored gum to substitute brushing my teeth. And then I got to thinking, what other oral hygiene corners can I cut?  Why should I floss when I can chew on a perfectly good toothpick? No more eating corn from the cob. From now on, it's corn from the can. I don't need to brush if I can get it out with my tongue. If the dentist can yank it out, so can I. No more eating onions. What will happen? Will I suddenly become malnourished? A good "mouth sweep" with the index finger can do the trick. Gargling with a mouth full of water and toothpaste always fools everyone. Receding gum lines can be halted with the proper flying buttress supports. Hydrogen peroxide can brighten even the most yellow plaque and tartar buildup. Two hours before seeing the dentist, I can gargle with Listerine, eat some Cool Mints, brush my teeth several times in a row, floss angrily causing severe bleeding, eat some Certs, spray in a little Binaca, take a mouthful of Altoids, and voila! The dentist will be none the wiser...

						   They (committee of hypothetical people) say that religion is the opiate of the masses. But I (committee of one) say that horoscopes are the real opiate (or narcotic or barbiturate). This morning, I looked at my Excite! horoscope, and it said that my finances would greatly improve, which coincided with yesterday's personal forecast: "You will fall on financially easy times." Then it gave a detailed analysis of my personality that put my mother's intimate knowledge of me to shame.  Of course, I bought it all. I ate it up. And then I got queasy, for I realized I had been duped into not worrying. How could I, an intellectually gifted yet cosmically challenged person, believe that these printed words pertained to my own destiny? It made me wonder how many other credulous people out there had fallen for these fortune-cookie self-help predictions, neatly published into uncompromising vignettes, categorized according to arbitrary dates set by them (committee of unknowable hypothetical people). Who else follows this painstakingly unsolicited advice about their lives and then decides, based on frivolous warnings, to go on a shopping spree because they think their financial situation will greatly improve? Or what about the unlucky sap who decides to test out his daily horoscope, which states that he should wait until the afternoon to make any business transactions, and leaves his phone off the hook while, unbeknownst to him, the Minnesota Zoo repeatedly calls to inform him that he has won a free pass to the monkey exhibit?  I, for one, would like to see an end to published horoscopes.

						   I hate having to wake people up. It's too much responsibility. It sounds easy at the time, and that's why I don't turn people down when they ask for this simple request. "Wake me up at such-and-such a time." Sure, why not? And their instructions are explicit. "Don't allow waking-state me to go back to sleep. Whatever I say, don't give me another 15 minutes, even if I somehow come up with a good excuse for why I need it." Don't be fooled by their crafty alternate personality is their advice. And when I go to wake them up, they say EXACTLY what they told me they would say. "Ok, just 15 more minutes." I have a very hard time arguing with that. What am I going to say? "No, the Other You told me that This You can't sleep in. You have to get up." Most of the time, I give in.  And then, of course, they eventually wake up and shed their alternate ego. "What?" they ask incredulously. "You actually LISTENED to me? I don't know what I'm saying. I told you I would come up with some lame plea. I LIED to you. And now I'm late for work, because you listened to me."

						   I just drank a can of Red Bull. I guess I am now an unofficial representative and pseudo-sponsor of the product. All I can say is that I was tired before I started drinking, and now I'm still tired but very alert. And slightly frightened. All the added B vitamins have generated a response from my brain--namely, that my synapses are open firing on others with machine-gun repetition and alacrity. It's like I'm forced to keep my eyes open for any and all potential disasters, even though my conscious mind clearly doesn't care about these dangers and wants to take a cat nap.  Last night, some hoodlum broke into my car. (I'm only assuming he was a hoodlum. He could be the respected member of a Masonic lodge, for all I know, or a lifeguard.) I noticed something was awry because the back window was smashed in, and I remembered that I hadn't smashed it in earlier that day. Luckily, there wasn't much in my car to take, except for an old, battery-challenged Discman. Which the felon took, of course. A few weeks ago, I caught some woman digging up and stealing plants from our garden. Two years ago, a couple of men were executed in our alley. My mom explains these events by telling me that we live in an "eclectic" neighborhood. I think that's a very nice way of putting it. "Some of the people here are really nice and some are criminals. See, Alexa? Very eclectic. And liberal." No, I guess you don't hear about conservative and pro-life burglars. At least they vote Democratic or Green Party.  But going out of your way to steal a Discman that is no less than five years old??? The thieves in our neighborhood don't even have lofty ambitions. They're underachievers. But as long as they support unions and women's rights, maybe it doesn't matter.

						     urlLink Without any forewarning, let me warn you that this entire blog is one giant link. To where? Does it matter? You're going to click on it anyway. Where could it take you? Or better yet, where might it take you? To another blog? To some crazy clown website? To an outdated news report? To an award-winning artsy site? To my online bank account? You won't know until you find out. And you can only find out by knowing. You have to. You need to know where it leads. Maybe it's a site you've never been to, but have heard about near the water cooler, under the air conditioner, or conveniently behind a vent. Is it morbid? Is it unethical? Whimsical? Musical? Why would I link to this site specifically and dedicate an entire blog entry&nbsp;to it? Well, it must be a special site, no doubt. Or maybe you've considered that it's a ruse, that you're&nbsp;being fooled into thinking it's a great site, all shrouded in mystery and crap. Could you learn something from it? I can tell you one thing--it's no link to the Boobah Zone. That site I learned, after spending three hours trying to navigate around its seemingly coded labyrinth, was a commercial advertisement for a children's show. And that right there taught me a lesson: I need to learn to not be so confused. Well, click on this link. If you dare. If you like the thought of flying panties or pigs wearing overalls...

						    You know, it's very hard to write in a different font. What I usually have to do is write in plain-text Times New Roman, and then highlight what I've written and set it as a new font. So don't be fooled if you think I get my ideas from switching it up--writing boldfaced, adding quirky Courier commas, italicizing everything. No, it all looks pretty basic when I'm doing the actual writing. I thought you might like to know this about me, and I hope I've answered a few questions from those people who insist they are my "fans who sometimes write hate mail."     &nbsp;   Jake from New Gouda, Tennessee, writes: "I'm sure you get a lot of letters from people since you are a syndicated diarist. But tell me: what is your secret? Where do you get all of your whacky ideas? If you don't use all of the ideas, can you give some to me?"     &nbsp;   Well, Jake, yes I can't. You see, it's not so easy writing a syndicated (your word) diary that is read by untold tens of people. I have to appeal to at least five of my eight readers worldwide. When I'm writing, I must keep this in mind. Otherwise, I lose my readership, my advertisers, my financial backers pull out, the value of my stocks drop like dense&nbsp;horse pellets, and all my shareholders burn effigies in my front yard, which makes the neighbors angry, who then call the police, which then attracts news reporters, which makes the value of my property decrease. For a writer, this is a lot of pressure. One bad article or column or bumper sticker, and my house will&nbsp;get repossessed. I walk a fine line with every word I write. I hope this answers your query.     &nbsp;   Michelle from Goat Cheese, Vermont, writes: "Your website is dedicated to competitive blogging. How can an online diary ever become a sport? And why would anyone want to&nbsp;air out&nbsp;their personal lives in a contest?"     &nbsp;   The whole point of competition, Michelle, is to make all the people who don't win (which is everyone who entered the contest except for the one person who wins it) feel bad. The principle of competition is the driving force behind our wonderfully fair&nbsp;free-market economy, a sort of&nbsp;Darwinian theory applied to Wall Street, where&nbsp;many people clamor for endless commodities, but only a few get to enjoy them. It's survival of the priveleged who have great contacts in high places. In other and more words, our economy is designed to make people feel bad and hurt their feelings. And isn't that what democracy is all about? And free speech? And the right to justify liberty? Competitive blogging will bring out only the best blogs while ceaselessly punishing the bloggers who didn't win. If you can't see the point in that, I can't help you.

						    Even though it looks lame, "Courier" got me through college. Without it, I wouldn't have the worthless degree that has kept me from securing a job. Nor would I have the confidence in my abilities to write a 25-page thesis. That is, until I started using extra bold 36-point Courier font. My life without this epiphany, as I know it, would be different. I might even be in jail.      Courier established, for me and for many more students who feel that a good paragraph should be no longer than two sentences, a unique collegiate writing pattern that I will never forget. In essence, Courier taught me that the minimum spacing in between words should be no less than a few inches and that the actual letters should be girthy and elongated in width. I don't know if I can speak for others here, but this particular font freed me from the omnipresent belief we're taught starting in high school: the more words, the longer the paper. In fact, the very opposite is true: the bigger the letters, the longer the paper. I never understood why dictionaries have used such small inscrutable fonts. Why not cut the corners, use larger letters, and skip defining words that no one cares about, such as "druther" (combination of "I'd rather") and "pate de foie gras," which, as far as I'm concerned, is French and doesn't belong in an English dictionary.      I think Courier also teaches another invaluable lesson, that of saying less while using the same amount of paper. Also, it is important to remember that thick paper helps your writing cause. With thin sheets, such as those found in literature and history anthologies and The Big Long Bible, a 100-page paper can appear to be the size of a Post-It(tm) note. Using thicker sheets, preferably the same size as the tree from whence they came, makes your paper, letter, or "to do" list look much more substantial, and let's not forget, pretty darn girthy.

						     I don't usually work during the day unless someone in the house is retired, unemployed, or unemployable. And I was fine with this intermittent workload--I'd do overtime on weekends and would sometimes work for hours straight without a break at night--until technology advanced, introducing the DVD player. I don't mind him, and I'm not bitter that he sits on top of me. (The family claims he weighs less, but I know the truth. They want easier access to him because he can do so much more...) But really, who wants to watch an entire movie with the cast members and directors talking over every single fucking scene? Is that a really important feature, or do DVD players have it because they can? Oh, I guess with Mr. DVD, you can select any scene out of the movie at any time, but I don't require that much more effort. Just go the extra mile, people, and hit REWIND. It's one button (not like flipping through 18 scenes to find the right one) and then a slight pause while I backtrack through the tape.          You know what I resent? Not being officially obsoletized and thrown out. I cannot tell you how many times he skips or jumps his films, ruining it for everyone. And then, of course, they turn to me, to analog, because I'm dependent, reliable. There might be some slight tracking problems in the beginning, but I can fix those myself on a good day. There's never any need to have to start the movie over again because of some technical malfunction. I'll be able to tell you right away if you can watch the whole thing. For all you people out there who are the proud parents of two movie mediums: VCRs have the temperaments of cats. We like regular schedules. We don't like to be moved around. And we don't "eat" tapes accidentally.

						    To Wham-O:   I am writing this letter to thank the manufacturers of all Slip-n-slide products for putting their potentially dangerous children’s toys back on the market after a few years in the early 90s when they were recalled. It made me learn, at a very young age, that under no circumstances can I ever put a wet piece of plastic over my own lawn and expect it to protect me from the small rocks&nbsp;underneath. Slip-n-Slide also taught me the lesson that if a toy harms only a few children, it won’t be considered defective and pulled off the shelves until it can be proven that several children slipped and slid to their untimely deaths. While the Slip-N-Slide merchandise is not for everybody, particularly those who have blood vessels near the surfaces of their skin, I admired the Wham-O disclaimer on the product safety guideline brochure, which states that if you are over 110 pounds and/or you place one end of the plastic sheet too close to a wall or cliff, you could become paralyzed (e.g. former 160- pound Slip-N-Slide&nbsp;customer from Wisconsin who became&nbsp;paralyzed after&nbsp;putting the plastic sheath&nbsp;next to a brick wall).  I hope that your Product Development and Quality Assurance teams are hard at work on the next big Wham-O item. Perhaps small, almost inscrutable marbles for babies? Or tiny tot blow torches? Whatever the case may be, I look forward to many more years with Wham-O, provided that I read all the fine print lest I become a victim of corporate delinquency.  Optimistic and not too girthy for Wham-O,  Alexa

						    I've often fantasized about indoor water polo. Since I'm neither lucid or coherent this morning, I can at least bask in the thought that I am out of work. For now, since I'm completely unaware of my surroundings and cannot actualize the world beyond my couch, I am happy and unafraid and regard the future as some far-off place, a meandering destination that has nothing to do with my current situation. Unable to sympathize or even feel self-pity, I check the room for general distractions and gleefully acknowledge that reality is a social construct. Because today, my friends and cohorts, I am dazed. But not confused. I see the world and its inhabitants through a pleasant, bay window that's been installed in the driver side of my car. I tune into the beauty of a simple flower and disavow any knowledge of evil and abject cruelty. I even go so far as to say that if there is evil in the world, I am fine with it as long as it doesn't end up in my front yard. I look out into the empty street and conjure up people attending neighborhood festivities. Some of these people are carrying water balloons. The other half are carrying umbrellas. It's a peaceful celebration. I sigh the greatest sigh ever heard and turn away to visions of ample air time on TV for dogs that have jobs.      Yes, I make a mental note. There are dogs who have jobs, who work for a living. They're performers, artisans, craftsdogs, laborers, motivational woofers, investment barkers, dogs with more training than I've got. There are dogs who are employable because they have skills. DOGS. Yet I sit here, engulfed by mind clouds of happiness fuzzies, unable to attend to irrelevant matters, like feeding or dressing myself. Some of these professional dogs are fulfilled by their work. Some even volunteer or work for food, shelter, and if they're good, photo opportunities. These are dogs who are just happy to be giving back to the community, whose collective ankles they bite. Dogs who win prizes, beauty contests. Dogs who exhibit initiative. We get the Star Tribune every morning, but I refuse to fetch it. A dog will do this, and most of them can't even read. What am I lacking? Sizable canines? Paws? A smaller cranium that allows me to become agitated by the sound of a doorbell? A wicked aversion to men in uniform? A real appreciation for the finer foods in life, like liver snaps and gizzards?

						    Some people may say I haven’t lived up to my potential, but I think I’ve come a long way since my days as an infant. Nobody ever gives me credit for childhood accomplishments. After one achievement, it's always, "So what are you gonna do next?" When is it enough? When do people stop asking me? When I exhibit signs of mental deterioration? I'd really like to break down my childhood in terms of goals met. I'll start with my birth, which was cruel and unusual. But, hey, I survived. Within three years of my grand entrance, I learned an entire language with its structural nuances, grammatical functions, and verbal inflections. And nobody has ever considered that to be amazing. In that same three years, I also learned how to eat solid foods, walk, run, and clean up after myself. I learned that crayons can be used on paper and as well as on walls. I learned the rules of baseball and hockey. I learned to count to 100. I learned simple arithmetic. I categorized the world according to two important groups: edibes and non-edibles. (And I did this with very little experience. Call it intuition, but I knew I couldn't eat parts of the sidewalk or plastic shovels.)      I have to admit, since my days as an infant, things have slowed down quite a bit. All I can say for myself in the past few years is that I've learned tact and diplomacy to an extent. While I lack certain traits admired in highly effective business people, I feel that the neurotic behaviors and quirky habits I've amassed in my pursuit to remain in denial have given me an edge. While I'm not as likeable as some, I'd definitely recieve an "honorable mention" at my own funeral.

						   In the beginning, there was Heaven and Earth. Then a few millenia passed, and a wonderful prose fiction arose, plumbing the depths of happiness, eternally ungrateful for "the small things in life," and spasmodic in its praise of meatballs. It was called "100 Ways to Have Fun with Anhedonia." Then there was Hell.  Written by an author, "100 Ways" didn't reach its intended audience until after it was published and some copies were sold. It wasn't a bestselling novel in the early months of its release. With profits on the wane because the book was such a hit with the kleptomaniacal demographic, Penguin Distribution and Folks(tm) decided to pull it off the display shelves in bookstores, relegating the book to the Remainders section. Then they planned to stage a coup, purchasing every book in the store and returning them all with different book flaps in the hopes that "100 Ways" would have a more memorable title like "The Angst of the Cornucopia: How I Learned to Love Again."  Afraid that purchasing the rights to the book was, literary, a mistake, Penguin Publishers and Venal Sons decided to White Out pages in the text that seemed superfluous and vain. Fifteen years later, Dunquist Books Limited bought the languishing book from Penguin and revived the deletions. Parts of the unabridged version are as follows:  Number 12: Look directly into the sun. For a long, extended period of time. While you may suffer no side effects now, you have already permanently damaged your retina!  Number 44: Drink sewer water in Mexico. Tell everyone.  Number 70: The downward spiral in the abyss of your mind is real. Go with it!  Number 2: Never delight in a Broadway musical or take tap dancing lessons.  Number 39: Once you have climbed your way to the top, give in to childish whimsies and destroy your reputation.  Number 63: If the world doesn't understand you, you probably are alone. Take some time out to cry.  There are more tidbits of wisdom in this enchantingly great read. Packed with maxims, aphorisms, and practical philosophies, this life-renouncing novella has changed the lives of many people, propelling some into schizophrenia and many others into clinical depression, usually followed by a suicide attempt. When it first was published as a serial list in "The New Republic," critics panned it. "Very negative outlook on life," reported the Chicago Sun-Times. "This list can only be described as bleak." But readers, anxious to hear that there is no God or Afterlife because humans don't have souls, were not deterred.  Luckily, man's search for ultimate meaninglessness is still a relevant sociological and psychological topic, and this enables "100 Ways" to continue its unabated mission today.

						   In this day and age of child molestation protocol, love is hard to come by, especially if you never leave your house. I’ve been here for days with the doors unlocked, the shades up, and a bright neon sign saying “OPEN,” and still, nothing! Not even a homeless drunkard looking for shelter. Sometimes I wonder how my parents met—you know, before they broke up—and then I fantasize that I, too, might like to unexpectedly meet the man of my dreams in a community bathroom while I’m towel drying my hands on my blouse and he’s using the latrine. But that’s only a castle in the sky, not real life. I think the important thing to remember when looking for a life-long partner, or even a life-long tortoise, is to keep in mind that the search must continue no matter how hopeless the situation may seem or how unseemly an old prom dress may look when you’re wearing it alone at a local tavern, sitting on a bar stool, drawing little hang-man doodles on a bar napkin with a wet ring of bourbon staining the picture, like a moustache on the Mona Lisa or antlers on The Scream.  Some people never find love. These people are usually midgets. Well, nobody can see them, and they always get so defensive if someone says, “Speak up, little man!” or if they are mistaken for those painted trolls people put out on their lawns. “Bend him over just the right way, and you’ve got yourself a human lawn jockey” is often overheard at suburban cocktail parties at The Wyndie Hill Estates to the chagrin of tiny people everywhere.  I am somewhat of a stranger to love, although I’ve been in a few relationships. What matters is that I’ve never given up on them. What doesn’t matter is that I often use the word never quite out of context. Giving up on love, though, reminds me of a story—a story which I will tell you as soon as I turn this loincloth around to face the other direction. My grandfather once told me the anecdote, but when my grandmother overheard him use the word pantyliner, she interrupted to reiterate, profusely deeming his version “inappropriate.” I was pretty young when I heard the fable, and I’m not even sure those people were my grandparents, but let me endeavor to tell you as best I can, what with the loincloth and all.  There was an old man who lived in the country. His name was Battle Ax, for purposes of protecting the rights of the innocent, namely myself. He had farmed there all his life. His great-great-grandfather, Battle Ax, Sr., had settled the land, but in a tragic accident wherein his coronary arteries became blocked after consuming his usual breakfast of a stick of butter dipped in mayonnaise, he died suddenly right there at the table, face first into the leftover butter and saltlick appetizer at the tender age only the luckiest of centenarians live to be—92. Although the family assumed Battle Ax, Sr. to be the most gentle human ever to have lived, an autopsy revealed that he was really an alien and that his true name was Sir Klondike. Shortly afterwards, the boy child, whom the story is about, grew up, raised four children, and went on to become diabetic despite the family’s efforts to dissuade him from that disruptive lifestyle.  Late in his old age, the family took Battle Ax on vacation to Puerto Villarta, a little tourist city in Mexico. He enjoyed his time there immensely but became emotional when his good eye spotted a dead fish on the shore. The old man ran over and picked up the fish, whose eyes had been eaten and whose head was hollow like a whiffle ball bat, and said, “Hello, fishy, fishy. Wake up.” Battle Ax listened patiently for a response, but the fish didn’t answer. “HELLO, FISHY!” he screamed into the fish’s ear. But still, no retort came.  The old man, dissatisfied with the silence of the carp and beginning to suspect it was actually a northern pike, began shouting violently at the fish, shaking it with all the might he could muster. “Fish, I command you to say something!” he wailed. But the cunning fish said not a word. Fed up with such nonsensical insolence, he began to slap it around, banging its head against concrete slabs and scaring the gathering of children who had come to watch the spectacle.  “I did not disrespect my elders at your age,” Battle Ax pointed out to the deceased fish, knowing very well that if he kept up this rigorous activity, involuntary bowel movements might occur. “And I still respect them now,” he continued, “even though they are but spirits who play with my Saran wrap at midnight. Now, fish, speak to me. I am an old man, and my time here is not long, as my sense of sight is not what it used to be, and wasps look an awful lot like flying Milk Duds™ these days.” Unperturbed and even more unmoved, the fish was silent.  After what seemed like hours to crowd and days to the fish, the old man finally ended the struggle and nodded his swollen head in understanding. “I see,” he smiled, unaware he had just contracted viral meningitis. “Your silence is your wisdom, which you would like to impart to me before my silence is eternal. You are a clever and well-organized bottom-feeder. Your lesson I will take with me when my soul leaves my earth-bound body behind. My humblest apologies.”  Ten years to the date, Battle Ax suffered a fatal nose-picking session and died shortly thereafter.  The moral of the story that you should take home with you to show to your mother is that while the world spins wildly out of control, you sit by idly picking your nose. Where is your sense of purpose, of duty in life, and what if you forget to switch nostrils and end up with what looks to many like a problem in facial symmetry? The point is, the old man gave up. He stopped, in so many words, “slapping the fish around.” Then he died. That’s what happens to people who stop believing. And so it is with love. If you let go of the faith and begin to focus more on your education and career and less on your romantic life, your fish will never jabber on and on about silly, mundane things; it’ll only be silent—silent and wholly unforgiving…with no eyes. Remember, this is not my story; nor is it my Grandfather’s—it’s actually Plato’s account of Socrates’ grandfather’s story. No, it isn’t. But I bet I made you think just now.

						    By alexa kocinski   I had studied under the supervision of Frygate for several months after I graduated from college, and so I decided to interview the man whom I admired and who had showed me how to be productive while waiting in bank lines. Frygate was a man of repose—so different and disturbed, and yet he could still carry a tune while whistling and humming simultaneously. At first, this great playwright, author of astonishing works like  The Aimless Entrepreneur  and  Buttermilk!  , objected to the interview, insinuating there’d be trick questions he couldn’t answer, possibly involving two trains heading from ports on opposite sides of the United States at the same time, traveling at various speeds and carrying weighty cargos. If the line of questioning went as he imagined it might, one of the trains would invariably be a ghost train, so which one would reach Topeka, Kansas, first? Or would the immaterial train simply pass through the real train, and then, who would know the difference anyway? I assured him I would not ask queries of this kind, but I had to cross out a few on the list. For over an hour, I diligently thought of new questions while Frygate whittled a toothpick into an ornate depiction of a penguin in distress. However, after much pressing and hemming and hawing and eventually the overdue mending of some under shorts, I was able to secure an entire day with this fantastic homme de grand chou.  Frygate grew up in the ritzy section of South Side Chicago, and as a child, he was diagnosed with a phobia of cures, which abruptly ended his hobby of being in therapy. At the age of 23, he submitted a collection of poems about a mole overcoming a sinus infection. Random House refused to publish it on the grounds that it lacked any reference to the mole’s family medical history. After a series of debilitating falls, Frygate swore off writing and said that he wouldn’t submit another thing until somebody published him. He later suffered a heart attack, and it was then that decided to have cosmetic triple bypass surgery. “That was a low point in my life,” he maintained. “I was young and vain.”  After the two of us sat down in his grand chateau, Frygate immediately apologized for his last play  God’s Silence is Constitutional  but also said that he was not responsible for it. “I wrote it while blindfolded and typed it with my toes,” he said, a technique he had honed while writing his first play  The Stitching of a Troubadour’s Pants , which received extremely poor reviews. Many literary magazines, including The New Yorker, cited “illegibility” as a problem with the playwright’s first attempt. “I worked diligently and was hard pressed to find a small theatre company that would even fund it. That hurt because of the hours I had spent typing the five-act tragedy with my head to the side using two pencils stuck in each ear.” Frygate noted what a failure his first tragedy was and then realized he had written a tragedy in the first place, so irony took its place, and he was able to laugh and wheeze into a paper bag about the blunder. “I’m asthmatic,” he explained.  The Ortway Ensemble, an off-off-Broadway agency, produced  God’s Silence . The show was Frygates’s attempt to stage a silent play where no one said anything or moved around a lot. But the plot twist and the surprise ending (which will be revealed in a television production of the play) eased audiences into its structural absurdity. Frygate was pleased with how quickly the cast, selected by longtime friend Shelley McBride, learned their lines. “Overnight” was his word. “I wanted to do a silent play because I got tired of people saying the stupid things I had written. I thought, if I can tell a story quietly, then I have made it. Of course, I didn’t think this aloud,” he winked cleverly. Frygate admitted that his first draft didn’t quite meet the requirements of silence. “People were talking in a regular-pitched voice.” Then he decided to employ the wartime tactic of whispering, which was first used during the battles of the Civil War by Confederate General Robert E. Lee. “Whispering was a great idea, but it didn’t capture the essence of my story, which was about God and how He got to be in the respectable position He is now by knowing just when to shut up. These days, people talk incessantly, making ignorant quips, ranting and raving about their opinions, backing up those opinions with opinions of friends who agree with them, talking, squawking, blah, blah, blah, Let’s go out to lunch at Trader Vic’s, I got the sushi last time, it was great, yes, but don’t you remember when we were there, I choked on a pineapple, yeah, but it was your fault, you tried to swallow it whole—and people are doing this all the time; they don’t even know it, yapping away their lives, wasting time with slight anecdotes and irrelevant comments, and it’s like they’re trying to hear themselves go on and on, and do they ever stop? Of course not. It’s a wonder that there are any productive moments in the world today. Speaking of productivity…” As the reader may have guessed, I had a hard time with Frygate’s tight-lipped answers and curt descriptions. It was like pulling teeth to get anything out of him. Maybe he was trying to eschew silence, as only a genius can.  Frygate inhaled. “I initially wanted subtitles so people could comprehend the conversations, but that didn’t work, because it wasn’t a film. And the actors got tired of carrying around large, wooden cue cards. We didn’t know about less dense materials back then, like fiberglass.” He finished by exhaling into a balloon, which he housed thousands of in his trophy room to save the air expelled from his lungs. “If the world ever runs out of oxygen, I’ll be one of the few people left with balloons in their home,” he commented.  Ambivalent about change and any negative criticism, his fifth draft was just a copy of the fourth until a former colleague suggested that he try turning a few of the less dimensional characters into orangutans. Frygate recalled thinking to himself during this hour of self-doubt, “Maybe if I handwrote the plays instead of using stenciled letters, I could write more than one play every ten years.” At this juncture and feeling creatively cramped, Frygate moved into the Soho district to a subsidized area for aspiring artists and writers, but once he thought of the section as a giant writers’ block, he was unable to come up with any fictitious character names. “I couldn’t even think of the name ‘Dave’ without feeling I was plagiarizing somehow.” He wrote two lesser-known works (eventually published under the pen name “Frigate”) that, according to the Times, made good use of the letter G. At this watershed and with nothing to lose except his integrity and self-worth, Frygate really began to grow as an artist. His run-on sentences were interrupted by hyphens, and he stopped using three or more commas in a row. “Yeah,” he laughed inappropriately, “those were my spring chicken days.”  Tired of the anonymity that tends to haunt most Broadway and Hollywood writers, Frygate also chose to put his name on the playbills. “I found I got more credit that way. Also, I put my picture next to the name.” He revised the fourth act, wherein a stud poker game ensues in typical Frygate silence. Superimposing some dialogue, Frygate carefully omitted words, such as  deal, draw, card/s, I,  and  bingo . He also expected the players to adlib communication by gyrating frantically while maintaining a believable poker face. Finding the right actor to play the character of God, though—and here, Frygate envisioned an omniscient being who creates the universe and then takes a day off for Eternity—was rather difficult as attested by the nine-week delay of production that had Frygate and his associates hunting far and wide for the perfect person for the role. “I wanted someone who, when He walked into the room, displayed charisma and had a certain swagger, maybe somebody who could goosestep just like the Almighty could.” He found God in Mao Chin, a Buddhist atheist-turned-model-turned-actor-turned butterfly (in the following life). Auditioning for the main part, Chin exuded all-powerful Greatness and read the lines just the way Frygate had imagined them read—without stuttering. “When God gave Man free will and saw what he did with it during the 70s, He was tempted to take it back,” marked Chin’s opening lines and the actor’s first brush with fame.  The first act entitled  Italicized  featured an aging prophetess who had once, in her private heyday, been able to prophesize 30 to 40 years into the future, but because of the onset of glaucoma, she could only see 2 to 3 years in advance. “Fortunately,” Esmerelda explains directly to the audience—quintessential Frygate in-your-face-drama—“I used to see the big picture, but my peripheral vision has deteriorated. I can still envision where people will be in the future, but I can only see the tops of their heads.”  His next production, put on by the Tisane Community Theatre in Hoboken, New Jersey, entitled “Abbr.”, was much shorter than a standard three-act play, but went over well with the hard-to-reach narcoleptic demographic. “I blinked twice,” raved one audience member, “and missed two-thirds of the play. Reading the playbill took up more time. I was really impressed by Abbr.’s pithy nature.” Frygate, known for his rambling soliloquies, had his characters speak in monosyllabic tones, sometimes supplanting long speeches with simple gestures. It was also the first time he incorporated hand puppets.  To this day, Frygate remains dedicated to the alcoholic and promiscuous lifestyle of a writer, but he feels that writing plays is just a jumping-off point for his real ambition: designing and editing medical pamphlets on contagious diseases. “I think my real calling is to write eloquently about herpes and investigate the artistic potential of STDs. No playwright now or way back whenever has ever ventured into this unsightly territory before. I see myself someday using adjectives, such as  inflamed, oozing, open sore-like, itchy , and  burning , in a free and uninhibited manner.” Frygate, who will reveal his middle name to the world during the Democratic National Convention in Pittsburgh, is still optimistic about the past and nostalgic about the future, even though he’s nearing the age most people turn after 68. But he is lucid, candid, and revealing and shows no signs of dementia, infirmity, or senility. After the interview was over and with a glimmer in his eye, he bade me farewell and hurried me out of the door into the foyer. Still learning to decipher his infamous subtlety, I ascertained he wanted me to leave. Either that, or pick up his dry cleaning tab. After all, Frygate the man was and still is one of the most comprehensible enigmas of our time. And I am honored to pay him this tribute.

						    Certain people think I'm out of touch with black culture, but just because I may be a white girl from the decent part of Minneapolis doesn't mean that I'm not connected to the street life. I watch "Cops" and I'm a die-hard fan of Eddie Murphy and Latoya Jackson. I'm also proud to say that I graduated with black students and even ate near them in the same cafeteria. I'm definitely "hip" to the hip-hop culture. (Rocking to the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie!) I am uniquely fond of "shizzle," as it is easy to insert into lyrical poetry because it rhymes with so many other words, such as "nizzle," "drizzle," "fuhzizzle," and "mizzle." Apparently, there are only a precious few who understand black life and community in a way that white kids, who have cable, do. Like  urlLink Johnny and Sally , I have a sizable collection of black friends, and the list of homeboys and homegirls grows every day. In closing, I'd like to say Peace Out to all my pimps and dawgs. Keep it real, yo! And remember: broadcast networks are too afraid to accurately portray black culture without all of the attendant and easily recognizable negative stereotypes. Luckily, we have BET and Animal Planet to take up where they leave off.      AL "just don't call me late for dezzissert" KOCINSKI

						   I can't get comfrotable. I've had caffeine and nicotine, so I'm restless. I don't want to sit still. And my mom--may she rest in peace--won't be leaving for work for another couple of hours, and in her spare time, she nags and complains. I really would rather have my mornings to myself. I like taking it easy, having my smoke, drinking my coffee, thinking my own thoughts.  Ah, here she comes, and it looks like she's forgotten not to bother me. "Alexa, are you gonna fold those clothes in the basement?" I swear, that's all she wants to talk about--personal hygiene and household chores. This morning, I caught her sweeping a floor that I cleaned less than three days ago. Life for my mom is all about watering plants, feeding cats, and vacuuming. So far, she hasn't said one word to me. I appreciate her not meddling in my morning affairs. But now she's talking to the cat, and that's irritating me. Every time I have a conversation with her, she always interrupts me with "Come here, kitty," "stop it, kitty," and "what do you want?" Sometimes if she wants to say something that's really important and the comment can't wait, she says, "Oh, look at her. Isn't she adorable?" Right in the middle of my sentence. I can't finish a story, because somewhere in the room, there's a cat looking REALLY ADORABLE. I wish there was a kind of medication available out there for people who can't shut up--a pill that makes you want to listen to people without adding anything to what they're saying. A pill that stops your own thoughts while someone else is talking. Or maybe just a pill that makes you ill every time something looks like it could be just tooooo adorable, so that you have to look away.

						    A new clinical study done by Dr. Becker, head of the Mayo Clinic's Ophthamology Wing, and Dr. Leder, orthopedic optometrist at Boone County Hospital, suggests that cancer of the lungs and freckles are both definitively related to second-hand smoke. In several tests, subjects who were exposed to second-hand smoke without smoking themselves were four times as likely to develop lung cancer and three times as likely to complain about the side effects than those in the placebo group. However, subjects who inhaled first-hand smoke showed no likelihood of developing cancer at all. In fact, Dr. Leder wrote in an article in The Harvard Medical Journal, "second-hand smoke seems to have the most dramatic effect, whereas first-hand smoke has hardly any negative consequences."  The double-blind study conducted by four people who knew nothing about the test, its subjects, the results, laboratory protocol, or beekers confirmed Dr. Becker's original hypothesis: that second-hand smoke is the major result of first-hand smoke. "A smoker," Becker explains, "is four to five times more likely to smell worse than a non-smoker. But the smoker is less likely to develop cancer than the non-smoking person who sits next to him."  But what about the person who inhales his/her own second-hand smoke? Dr. Leder said that his colleagues were working on that question. "In the event of a smoker inhaling second-hand smoke, we would presume that he, too, would be at the same risk for freckle and lung cancer as second-hand smokers." Dr. Leder suggests that smokers who don't want to inhale that second round of smoke should exhale quickly and then run to the other side of the room.
