      Hi All,   Quick update on me at the moment:  Working as Senior PALS Officer at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.  It's Saturday and had to go in for Hospital Open Day, which I was dreading, but turned out to be rather cool.  Performed an endoscopy and keyhole surgery on some unfortunate dummys!  Lots going on at the moment - am standing for election as the Liberal Democrat candidate for St George's Hill, Elmbirdge Borough Council, Surrey.  Last time we came fourth place out of four (with 50 votes), so hopefully I'll beat that!  Am also the Chairman of the Gate Court Residents Group and am working on the establishment of the group (constitution, policies, bank accounts, etc) and some projects (have done a big 'clean up day' and am planning a major garden project and a residents barbeque).    Just completed a website of useful healthcare and related links at http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/sgshields would be grateful for constructive criticism as I'm hoping to develop it some more and distribute it widely.    It's my friend Christian's birthday on Monday and we're going to Alton Towers to celebrate - one of the few occasions where having arthritis is very useful, as I don't have to queue (just wondering who out of my friends will win the accolade of being my 'carer' and get to annoy the rest of the gang with me).

      Am rather wiped out after the election and a day's training (on Anti-Social Behaviour and Incentives for Volunteers - am now planning a riot and to pay myself a fortune!).  I didn't win in the council elections (which wasn't suprising considering we only got 90 votes last time), but I'm glad to say that my vote was 139 (up about a third).  Very proud of the party for having beaten Labour into third place, for storming into power in Newcastle and making gains up and down the country.  Thanks to all of you who helped me - it was greatly appreciated and has set me up well for the future.

      Have been stupidly busy this week.  A colleague was attacked at the weekend, so it's been pretty horrific for her to cope with and as there's only the three of us, when one's away the others really feel it!  Had to deal with some of our most challenging clients yesterday.  Obviously, I can't go into details, but one was a 'regular' who spends most of her waking life abusing and harrassing NHS staff throughout the UK.  The other involved dealing with the alleged purpetrator of some of the most disgusting abuse I've heard of.  Difficult stuff-I greatly valued the kind and professional support (and end-of-the-day hug!) of my new officer, Lindie.   Got a lot to do this weekend as it's the last one before the election.  Am pleased with the friendly reception I've been getting - just hope that translates into votes!  Am taking on the local independent group that run Elmbridge Borough Council.  They have focused on hampering development (wasting many thousands on wasteful appeals that they have lost) and seem to be divorced from reality (they're planning to move Walton's swimming pool from the town centre to within spitting distance of an existing, modern pool and away from decent public transport links - utterly gobsmaking).    Have also got lots going on with the Gate Court Residents Group that I'm Chairman of.  We've got major landscaping and CCTV projects planned, requiring a huge amount of work and consultation.  Will be very glad to see these schemes get off the ground and give a much-needed boost to local spirits.    Looking forward to getting a bit more time back and getting on top of my workload(s!)... think I might just have tempted fate!
