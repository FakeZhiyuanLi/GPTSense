      First off, I won a T-Shirt at work today. It's a nice "I am MSN" T-shirt and I am excited to take it home and use it to clean the dirt off the wheel wells on my car. =P   And then... a gatekeeper at my work, Kelly (who I duped to win the t-shirt today *ha ha) went over to this construction site across from my work to find out what the hell they are doing. It looks like they are taking twenty 150 foot steel beams and shoving them deep into the earth right next to each other? Anyone know what the point of that is? I guess we'll find out soon from "Mentor Call Kelly" as I'll call him....   Hmm... claping and cheering for Kelly just erupted?! Enquiring minds want to know... more soon...

      Whoa, talk about dumb luck. Ann (the BIG boss) shoots me this email saying if my name is in the "To:" bar that I won a prize. And low and behold, what do my eyes see? "Jeremy *last name here*" in the "To:" bar!  (Note: I ended up buying Lord of the Rings 3, a stack of 100 CD's, and a CD case holder thingy with the gift certificate. Well, it paid for part of it, I paid out of pocket for the other stuff.)

      OK, I'm kinda bummed now because the main reason I signed up for this is so I could get a Gmail account. (and then sell it on eBay for $50!)But, I look on my homepage and no link - everyone else has one - I might just have to try and sign up again and see if I get a Gmail account this time...

      So, Slakis is calling back this customer at work today and gets his answering machine. (Nothing unusual so far, but read on...) Well, this guys answering machine states that he is the president of the Florida Chapter of the NAAWP (aka. National Association For the Advancement of White People). Well, we get curious about how hill-billies are and what they like, so I went to the site and signed up to the message board so I could post and see the posts from all these backwards racists out there.  I wasn't too shocked at what I saw, but there were some idiotic points out there and I made sure the Hill-billies knew it. So, instead of posting a link to the site to generate traffic for them, I'll just post something they posted with my rebuttal on this page...  Hill-billy-bob wrote:   "... All I can say is that I wish there was a way that when any black outlaws commit a violent crime against society, they would be shipped to Africa for a wake up call. The constant, perpetual racial unrest in this country is all because of the past, when Lincoln should have sent all of the freed slaves back to Africa where they came from. Its becaues of their attitude problem that they will never be accepted."   I wrote:    "Hellooo!! Did you think for one second before posting that? If you send a black man that commits a crime back to Africa, then you need to send a white man back to England, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Finland, or where ever else they came from when they commit a crime. The Native American race was here before white folk, and they should be the only one's NOT shipped off this country, if we, in fact, agree that shipping people out of the country is a good idea.   See, that's the problem with all you backwards hill-billies and why you will never succeed at "rising up" because everything you say has dual meaning and, if taken literally, it would usually discredit what just came out of your mouth (or off your keyboard and on to the internet as the case may be). Now, if you really want to make a difference, you need to educate yourself... oh wait, but once you do that, you realize your ideas make no sense and are idiotic in nature.   Get a life hill-billies... or, better yet, just go back to the trailor park you crawled out of and watch NASCAR all-day and leave the rest of us alone!"

      Well, I'm FINALLY able to add to this thing since getting a new job about a month ago. Sorry to everyone craving information about me and my life, really, I'm am very sorry (to all 3 of you at TPUSA, lol). Anyway, this place totally rocks! I wish you could all get hired here because you all deserve to work at a place that cares about you as a worker and as a person.   If you guys are still unsure of what OC Tanner is, here's the scoop. We make awards, (service, recognition, and achievements, those sort of things). Like say you worked somewhere for 50 years, we would be the ones that send you a Rolex with your companies logo engraved in it. What my job here is, is I'm a brochure builder. Basically, that means I take (or make from scratch) the company logo place it into templates on the web and in brochures that get sent out to employees of these companies so they can order whatever it is they want to order. It's a lot of work in Photoshop and mainly Freehand (sometimes Illustrator) and Dreamweaver (or just hard code) for the HTML of the website.   The coolest part about working here is I get my OWN PC, Mac, and most importantly, my OWN DESK! Yay! No more sharing headsets and computers with some dirty old man or someone that is sick or whatever. AND I get to put up pictures and decorate it, so that's kinda cool too.  Anyway, that's about all for now, I'll let you know how things are going once I actually start doing some REAL work.   See ya.

      Well, I'm doing real work, finally. Whew, there's A LOT of things that go into this job. I can see now why it pays more, I'm no longer some monkey on the end of a headset (no offense fellas) saying the same thing over and over to 50 people a day (or in my case just enough people to not get fired, which is about 10-15, lol).  But, that's the major difference working here so far, I feel like I'm important and I ACTUALLY WANT to do work. I've been staying late almost everyday and not getting paid for it. Ya, I know, that sounds stupid, but I take pride in what I do now, and when I say it's getting done that day, I'll make sure it gets done! Whoa... I kinda sound like an adult with a real job now? Hehe.   Well guys, I think that's all for now. Say "hi!" to everyone there at TPUSA for me...   Slakis - Becca thinks you are dogging her and that you are too cool for her. What's up with that? Go ask her out on a date or something, loser.   Jason - I don't even know if read this but, my wife is going out of town for a week to show off my baby to family in Washington, so, I should get to level 65 in Everquest soon. lol.  Becca - My wife is going to be out of town for a week and I don't really want to just sit and play Everquest all day, so why don't you ask one of your "girlfriends" to stop by with you and you two can mess around while I video tape it. =) -End
