      I love my friends, with a passion that is often unexplainable.  Pat is more then a friend, but the same applies to him.  Steven quit his job.  Not sure why.  I'm sure he got pissed off, and thought that with Louise's job, he had the lee-way.  But now he feels bad, and I feel for him.  I wish, often, that when my friends need something I could just supply it.  I wish that I could make things painfree for them.  I can never do that though, and am often at a loss of how to respond.  Poor Pet Toes.  Last night at work, we had very few people.  No one on the floor except the service departments which are required to be staffed.  Hardware (for the the paint), sporting goods (for licenses and keys), pets (for fish), electronics for the registers, and garden (for the registers).  None of the people staffing these departmends can be called away for help.  They can come get their returns, run to the back, and otherwise, must stay in the department.  That leaves : Domestics, paper goods and chemicals, housewares, stationary, over the counter pharmacy, HBA, Toys, and Foods with no one in them.  With 3 closing cashiers, it becomes painful.  A service desk which normally runs with 3 people, is running with 2, because almost every day in June one of us is on vacation.  By the time the closer gets there, the opener is leaving, giving us no time to catch up from the day.  We get no breaks, our lunches are short, and the people that cover us go into overtime.  Cindy got 25 minutes of overtime last night, even though I got back early from lunch, because of 2 problem customers in a row.  I shudder to think what would have occured if I had come back on time!  I got a raise though.  A merit raise.  Which makes me happy.  There's nothing like being shown "You're doing a great job" then by giving someone money!  YAY!  Pat and I got to go out to dinner!  So we went to Arby's to celebrate.  We went to Arby's for our anniversary dinner too.  I just realized how very truly sad that is.  Oh well :(

      I got this in my email the other day, and although I've looked through several hoax and urban myth websites, I really can't find any verification that it's a hoax!  Nonetheless, although it's something Rush WOULD say, I'm not going to believe it yet.  But still....worth a read.  ************ What's a Military Family Worth?  by Rush Limbaugh  March 11, 2002   I think the vast differences in compensation between the victims of the September 11th casualty, and those who die serving the country in uniform, are profound. No one is really talking about it either because you just don't criticize anything having to do with September 11th. Well, I just can't let the numbers pass by because it says something really disturbing about the entitlement mentality of this country.   If you lost a family member in the September 11th attack, you're going to get an average of $1,185,000. The range is a minimum guarantee of $250,000, all the way up to $4.7 million.   If you are a surviving family member of an American soldier killed in action, the first check you get is a $6,000 direct death benefit, half of which is taxable. Next, you get $1,750 for burial costs. If you are the surviving spouse, you get $833 a month until you remarry. And there's a payment of $211 per month for each child under 18. When the child hits 18, those payments come to a screeching halt.   Keep in mind that some of the people that are getting an average of $1.185 million up to $4.7 million are complaining that it's not enough. We also learned over the weekend that some of the victims from the Oklahoma City bombing have started an organization asking for the same deal that the September 11th families are getting. In addition to that, some of the families of those bombed in the embassies are now asking for compensation as well.   You see where this is going, don't you?   Folks, this is part and parcel of over fifty years of entitlement politics in this country. It's just really sad.  *********  wow....makes me want to cry.

      Well, I create my little blog here, and then life gets so busy I can't write in it!  Pat and I had a rough week, but the weekend was so nice, and I think things are back to normal now!  I hope!!  So, today at work....as I'm walking out of lay-a-way, clocked out, a customer askes me a question.  Now, I have no problems telling people where to go, but, geez.  I'm at work, carrying a wal-mart vest, so I help the guy.  A manager sees me, and she tells me, "I know you're going to fill out a time adjustment for that!".  GREAT!  Now I gotta go fill out paperwork.  See, so many wal-mart associates are filing lawsuits claiming the company forces you to work off the clock, that now, we have to fill out time adjustments whenever stuff like this happens.  So I spent 5 minutes helping the guy, through 3 departments, and now, it takes me 10 minutes to fill out the paperwork, and find management to get it signed.  Then she tells me I need another signature on it, from my hourly supervisor.  Well....she went home!!  So screw that.  I'm claiming all 15 minutes as overtime, and they WILL sign that stupid paper, or so help me, I will wreak havoc tomorrow!!

      What an exciting week!  Tovin made 50 after 3 years, and 24 days online; We camped the DreamSphere artifact for about 2 days straight, and either missed it, or the wrong spawn came up for us to defeat it with 3 people; I had 3 days off in a row, and did not one thing that I had planned to do; and the swimming season has begun!!  So, I guess, for the record, a little about me.  I'm 25.  26 on June 20th.  I live in the desert, Ridgecrest, California, with my boyfriend Pat.  He works at the  urlLink China Lake Navy Weapon R&D Base as a civilian employee of the Department of Defense.  I work at Wal-Mart.  (yay?)  I'm currently assigned to the Service Desk, where everyone returns their items, which makes for interesting, lunatic people at just about every moment of the day.  Everyone I work with, all 4 of us, are big-mouthed, sarcastic, cynical and extremely vulgar people.  With all of that though, we all have an incredible self-control that would never have occured to us to have if we weren't being paid to have it.  (Take note Wal-Mart customers - we have dreams about having large guns with unlimited amunition with us, so BE NICE, otherwise, one day, we just might.  Or we'll transfer to the post office.)  Pat and I live in a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment, which is hot as can possibly be right now.  Summer has definitely begun here.  Not a day will go by from June 1st to Mid-October that won't hit 100 degrees.  Starting mid-July, we'll start hitting 117 every day or so.  115 minimum.  We're an hour from the nearest major freeway (15) and we're about 20 minutes from the nearest real highway (395).  There are 25 thousand people that live in Ridgecrest.  900 live in Inoyokern, about 10 minutes away, and kinda slummy.  400 live in Tona, even slummier then Inyokern, yet, somehow, still habitable.  We have a Wal-Mart and K-Mart here.  A Subway's, Arby's, McDonalds, Jack 'n The Box, the Burger King shut down, we didn't ask why, I'd be afraid to find out.  There are no real nightclubs, except a few slummy ones.  Pat and I have started drinking more regularly, since, let's be honest, there's not a lot to do.  We play computer games a lot.  The current obsession is  urlLink Dark Age of Camelot  .  My main character is  urlLink Tovin .  She's a newly leveled 50.  The highest of any char I've ever played.  Me, I'm an arch-conservative, politcally.  I love   urlLink Bill O'Reilly , agree with Rush Limbaugh (his ideas, not his delivery), and have pretty much no complaints about Bush, except maybe the Amnesty plan.  I support our  urlLink military 100%, and just recently got my own cell phone (THANK YOU HONEY!!!!) which I am now in love with.  Text messaging.  It's the new email craze.  T-mobile rocks.  Verizon sucks....really.  Really, Really.  Pat is a little less conservative, 23, with a degree in Computer Science.  He's supersmart.  I love him lots.  And Lots and Lots!!!  Anyway.  I don't really have anything to rant about today.  Haven't been at work yet.  Trust me, it will happen!
