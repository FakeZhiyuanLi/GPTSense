      After the argument with my father about buying my townhouse, I had a pretty good Saturday.  My friend Ken from high school (I also went to college with him) called to tell me that they were going out, and asked me if I wanted to come along.  His roommate from college, Jackson, was coming down, and I had a crush on Jackson in college.  The guy looks like a skinner version of Jake Gyllenhaal... but with a unibrow.  But, strangely, the unibrow is sexy.  I don't know if Jackson knew that I had the hots for him or not, but we had some sort of "connection."  He got too drunk for me to act on it, but I think I ruined it anyway.  Jackson and Ken's friends Jamie and Tony were out with us also.  It was basically me and 6 guys.  It was fun... I just watched them get totally wasted.  Me and Tony started talking and when he found out I used to be married, he automatically deemed me "sexy" and "naughty."  Interesting.  I ended up hooking up with Tony later that night, as well as Jamie.  That's where the "ruining" part came in.  I probably could have hooked up with Jackson, and initially I really wanted to, but I figured I ruined it and didn't want to seem like the group blow-up doll.  Anyway, I would have gotten too hopeful in spite of the fact that Jackson is working the Warped Tour and won't be around all summer.  I'm sure I'll see him again, but I'll probably feel awkward.  Hopefully he'll forget it all.  I really want to see Shawn.  I wish I could talk to him more.  Sometimes I feel weird hooking up with other guys, even though there is absolutely NOTHING going on with the two of us.  I feel like I'm letting him down somehow.  I probably shouldn't feel that way.  Matt hasn't called me, thank God.  I guess he got the picture after our weird night together.  Anyway, gotta go...  Any thoughts on Bush's address tonight??  Not that anyone reads this or would like to comment...

      So my landlord calls this morning to say that she wants to sell the house.  But she wants to see if I want to buy it first.  OF COURSE I DO!  I am so tired of paying rent it's not even funny.  I'm so excited I could pee.  Then I call my parents to tell them the good news.  What does my dad say?  "No.  You're not doing it."  Hello?  I didn't call to ask your permission, I called to tell you the good news.  Then he starts ranting and raving about how I'm not divorced yet and if I buy the house before I'm divorced Pat will go after it and take half of the house.  I tried reasoning with him and saying that I highly doubted that, that I don't really talk to Pat, and that he doesn't have to know that I was buying it.  Of course, my father didn't want to hear it.  He was screaming over me.  He actually said, "I will not allow you to buy that house before you are divorced."  Oh really, Dad?  You're not going to let me?  I'd like to see you try.  Besides, my divorce hearing is on June 15th.  It's not like everything would happen before then.  Get real.  What gets me is that even though I'll be 25 in July, my parents still insist on pulling this garbage.  I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to ground me one day.  This is why I moved out of the house.  Even though I should be there helping my dad, I know that they would have this unbelievable control over my life.  Nothing I do is good enough for my parents.  I do not do what they want me to do, and they hate it.  They don't seem to want to let me have control over my own life.  Here I am, I graduated from college, I have a good job, I'm doing fine on my own, and yet they still think that I am 15 and I don't have a brain cell in my head worth a damn.  Well, you know what?  I'm still going to do whatever I want to.

      I felt like something was up today at school.  When I was done and in my car, I turned on my cell and sure enough there were 3 texts from him.  They said that he couldn't make it today.  His brother got jumped last night and was in the hospital.  I talked to him briefly tonight and he said that he didn't think anyone was going to get charged... and that no one was going to sue.  That frustrated me a little bit...  these assholes are not going to pay for what they did.  He's thinking about taking the vigilante route, but if he does that, he runs the risk of ruining his future teaching career.  I don't want him to do that.  Anyway... so here I sit at 8:45 on a Friday night with nothing to do.  I guess I'll have to go find something.

      Shawn and I are hanging out tomorrow night!  Oh happy day!  If his paycheck clears, he is coming down here, and if it doesn't, I guess I am going up there.  I have a good feeling about this one.  Hopefully y'all will send your good feelings over this way, too.

      I know the views that I'm about to post are controversial, but it's good to question things sometimes.  I saw this on another blog, and I thought it was worth the post.  "41 Problems with the Video and Official Story  1] Berg had connections to al Qaeda terrorists strong enough to be questioned by the FBI. His email was used by accused terrorist Zacharias Moussaoui. 2] The United States and the Iraqi police detained Berg for 13 days, not releasing him until his father filed suit. He was detained as a suspected Israeli spy. The US now denies it had anything to do with the detention despite correspondence to the contrary. The Iraqi police also deny any involvement in his detention. They are playing hot potato with it. 3] When Berg was detained he, a Jew, had a copy of the Koran and an anti-semetic book entitled 'The Jewish Problem'. That is just strange. 3] Berg doesn't struggle or even flinch when his head is sawed off with a western style military knife. 4] An Islamic extremist would know the proper way to behead someone. It is the chosen form of execution in Saudi Arabia and probably other Arab nations as well. It is accomplished with one clean sword stroke to the neck. The person hacking off the head obviously had a great deal of difficulty doing so, owing to the poor choice of blade and technique. 5 ] No blood spurts from his neck as he is supposed to be dieing. The amount of blood on the floor is much smaller than it should have been. He should have died from bleeding out and this would have resulted in a couple of liters of blood spurting from his neck. 6 ] No blood gets on the hand of 'Zarqawi' even though it was in front of Berg's neck when he should have been bleeding out. 7] Zarqawi is thought to be dead and is known to have an artificial leg. Clearly the man hacking off the head didn't. 8 ] Zarqawi is known to have a tattoo on the back of his left hand of three green dots. The man hacking off the head didn't have a tattoo on his hand. 9 ] All the men had nice WHITE hands. Except in the last 20-30 seconds when the face appears to have been digitally lightened, the hands are as white or whiter than Berg's skin. Arab terrorists don't have white hands.  10 ] All of the men had identical, nice, clean clothing. It looked new. This is unlikely for rogue combatants in a war zone. It is likely if someone needed some 'terrorist' clothing for a video. 11] If Zarqawi was in the video, why didn't he show his face? It is known to the US already. It would have established the video's authenticity. It would have inspired fear. So why's it covered? 12] The real Zarqawi speaks with a Jordanian accent. According to a CNN mid-eastern expert who is a fluent professional translator, this 'Zarwaqi' did not speak with a Jordanian accent. She dismissed the possibility of it being him out of hand. 13] The whole time line is completely fucked up. There are many inconsistencies in the time line. I could cite at least a dozen. The most obvious is that he was 'found Monday over the weekend' 14] The 'militants' stood with a Western posture. When they moved in, their movements were rehearsed. Each knew where he was going when the action happened as if it were pre-planned. 15] Two of the 'Arab militants' brought their left hands to their faces during the video. The left hand is unclean in Arabic nations. It is used to wipe one's ass. The left hand is taboo. An Arab wouldn't eat with it or offer it to someone, they are unlikely to touch their eyes with it, it is unclean. 16] 'Zarqawi' is wearing a large gold ring. Islam reportedly forbids men to wear gold jewelry. 17] The rifles are reportedly Galil variants. These would be Israeli rifles. Arab militants wouldn't use Israeli weapons. The guns are all either Galils or Mac's. 18] Between Berg being knocked to the floor and then hacked up, the video cuts for no reason. Remember this isn't a two camera shoot, there is no reason for the video to cut. Something was cut out, or it would be continuous. 19] The website to which the video was supposedly released was down within 90 minutes. All major news organizations supposedly learned of this video and obtained copies within that time. 20 ] Berg is wearing an orange uniform identical to those at used by the US for detainies. 21] The walls and room are reportedly identical to the prison. 22] Berg is shown in a chair identical to those in the prison. If he was in an abandoned warehouse why wasn't he on looted office furniture instead. These chairs are not extremely rare, but the odds of both chairs being identical is slim. 23] The video never mentions the word 'Al Qaeda', it uses the word al qaed. These are two different words, one is a name and means 'The Base'. The other is not a name and translates as 'one who sits by and does nothing'. This translation is from the CNN arab language expert. She reports that any fluent speaker of Arabic would notice this difference. 24] Nick Berg's dad and Berg's tower company appear on a Free Republic 'enemies' list. The list isn't too long. I'm not on it under any alias I've used. 25] Nick Berg's tower company is not registered in his home state of Pennsylvania. While not a legal requirement, state officials report it would be nearly impossible to do business without registering. 26] The time code on the tape is in military time. Arabs use the standard arabic clock. 27] This video came out just when it would help the Bush regime the most. Fucktards everywhere are now using it to justify widespread US war crimes. Hardly the sort of reaction Islamic militants would desire, but obviously quite predictable. 28] One of the towers Berg worked on, the biggest and most damaged one, was near the prison. 29] No one can account for Berg's whereabouts from between April 10th (when his father believe he was killed) to May 11th the most firmly referenced of three days his body may have been found. He looks very clean and well fed to have been held prisoner by savages for over a month. 30 ] The US has not stated how his body was identified. It didn't have a head. It should have taken some time to ID. 31 ] Except for the individual reading the prepared statement, the only words said by the other 'terrorists' were "Allah Akbar" over and over. The speech was somewhat slurred. The accent differs significantly from the reader. I don't believe that they all spoke Arabic. 32 ] The speaker fumbles the transcript several times and goes back to the same page several times. It appeared he was having trouble reading his own statement. 33] During the hacking up part the video camera zooms in indistinctly just where you would expect the filmer to be trying for the most horrid details. 34] The body makes no death throws. None. Nada. Most animals, when they die, convulse. 35] Almost nothing dripped from the recently severed head. If he had just died the head should have still had a lot of blood in it. A head holds around a liter of blood in soft sponge-like tissues, unless the blood was coagulated it should have dripped for some time. 36] Berg continues to 'scream' after his windpipe has been cut through. 37] The time code actually jumps 11 hours during once splice in the video. Oops! 38] Near the end of the video, after the chanting stops, a distinctly Western voice can be heard to say what sounds like "Thy Will be Done" it then repeats itself. Hear it at Breakfornews.coms 39] Berg's body, though he was a civilian, was flown by the military to Dover Air Force Base. His parents had requested to be there when it arrived but that permission was denied. According to Department of State Publication 10391, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Revised September 1996, "The U.S. Government cannont pay to have your body buried overseas or returned to the United States." This is a publication intended for Americans living / working abroad. 40] The voice reading the statement at the beginning not only does not match the lips, but when the pages are turned and obviously lost in confussion, there is no pause. If you try to resynch the audio with the video you can not. The voice is dubbed in and poorly lip-synched. 41] The guy hacking off the head has a black hood, there is a very subtle cut at the end (after Thy Will Be Done) and the guy holding the head up is suddenly wearing a white mask. The time code jumps over a minute.  Now, if it were just one or two of the above problems, I could perhaps write it off to strange coincidences or inaccurate information. Given the scope of the errors with the official story, it is obviously complete rubbish. It is very difficult to say, ever, who pulled a false-flag operation. Groups likely to benefit would include the Bush Administration, the CIA, US Military Intelligence, Individual US Prison Guards, Private Contractors, and Foreign Intelligence such as MI-6 or the Mossad. Intelligence black-ops are also often done for one group by another to allow deniability; this seems to be the case with the UN bugging scandal, and it is quite likely that more than one group was involved in Nick Berg's death as well. It is certain that Nick Berg was not executed via decapitation by 'Al-Qaeda Terrorist al-Zarqawi'."  There are also a number of other things that bother me about this guy.  I posted a couple of days ago that he was investigated by the FBI in 2002 for letting a terrorist use his computer.  This terrorist was none other than Zacarias Moussaui, another supposed "mastermind" of the 9/11 attacks that is now being held by the United States.  Woo hoo, that's not just any old terrorist.  Now I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist, but I think that this whole mess is a CIA psy-ops job.  You guys decide for yourself.

      I don't really have much to report.  By this afternoon, Dad felt well enought to go to the game.  I emailed Shawn and he was so sweet about it.  He said that he wanted to go to the game, but he was glad that my dad felt well enough to go.  What a honey.  I asked him if he wanted to hang out this weekend, and he said that he did.    Dad only made it through 4 innings.  It was really hot where we were sitting, and his legs were cramped, which isn't comfortable for him since he hurt it.  Then, right after he ate a pretzel, a woman with really strong perfume sat right behind him and the smell was making him sick.  His nose is really sensitive when he's on chemo.  So, after the 4th, we left.  The Phils were losing 5-3.  Of course, as soon as we got in the car and on the road, Burrell, Abreu, and Thome hit 3 homeruns in a row!  I felt really bad for Dad, because he was trying so hard to stay there for me, because he knew I bought these tickets especially for him.  At least he got to see the new stadium.  Well, I'm super duper tired, so I'm hitting the hay now.  'Night everyone!

      Ok, so I had my first day teaching the Holocaust to my kids.  Some of them came out with the most racist questions, I almost blew up.  One girl asked, in reference to some Jewish businessmen's wealthy statement in life, "Well, didn't they deserve the treatment they were getting?  Didn't some of them make a big deal of the fact that they were wealthy?"  Other questions I had pertained to "Jewish" being a race, and not a culture.  I was simply amazed by these questions.  It really makes me wonder what those kids are learning at home from the parents.  The whole thing just stunk of  American History X .  I decided today not to see Matt anymore.  After telling the story to several of my good friends, I realized just how odd, absurd, and totally ridiculous it was.  None of them could see me dating him seriously.  None of them could even see me messing around with him!  So, what do I do?  Do I just ignore his calls, or do I explain things to him?  I opt for the first, even though it's rude, because we never had a "talk" about anything in the first place.  So here I am at Square One again.  However, I have tickets to a Phillies game tomorrow night.  If my dad is too sick to go, there is a possibility of Shawn going with me.  He messaged me last night to apologize for not being around and to say that he was still interested in the tickets if I had no one to go with me.  I hope if my dad can't go, he can.  I'd really like to spend time with him because he really is a cool person.  We are alike on so many levels and I think I'd have a really great time with him.  The conversation would be wonderful, unlike with Matt, because we just didn't talk.  On a more serious note, my roommate told me that she might have to find her own apartment if her ex-husband decides to file for custody of their 2 1/2 year old daughter.  The main reason is that Scott is concerned that Sara does not have her own room at our house; rather, she sleeps in Julie's room with her.  I told Julie not to worry about it.  No judge would grant custody solely on the basis of a kid not having her own room.  Plus, Sara is here mostly during the day, so there really isn't any need for a separate room.  I'm just worried about her moving out, because I really don't have the money to live here by myself.  On the other hand, Scott changes his mind about as much as Julie changes Sara's diaper, so I'm not totally worried about it.  Well, I have to get to work... more lesson planning to do.  Won't be able to update tomorrow, but if Shawn comes to the game with me, I'm sure I'll have a lot to talk about on Wednesday.  :)  Later all.

      Ok, so after my post last night about being alone on a Saturday night, my cell rings and it's Matt again.  He tells me that he decided not to go out with his friends.  They're going to Long Beach Island, and it's always a big production when they go there because it's at least an hour away, and he has to work tomorrow morning.  So, in a very roundabout way dealing with having to go to Wal-Mart, he asks me if he can come over.  I ended up meeting him at Wal-Mart, which is weird, because why can't he just come over afterwards, but I needed dishwasher detergent anyway.  He follows me home, but there's nothing on TV, so we ended up watching the NBA playoffs.  He's making comments like, "Nice shot."  I'm making comments like, "Shaq is one huge man."  As you can tell, I'm not much of a sports person.    So he asks me if I want to go upstairs and finish watching the game up there.  I guess he's invited himself over for a sleepover.  This is where things start to get really weird.  He doesn't kiss me goodnight, but the minute I turn over to fall asleep, he begins to grope me.  Finally, I turned over and said, "Are you having fun over there?"  That's when he kisses me.  The incident continues, but since I may not know a lot of people who are reading this, I'm choosing not to post.  But, if you know me well enough to see me or talk to me on an everyday basis, you can ask for the whole story.  I think you will agree that it is weird.  To look at the Big Picture, I don't really think I want to date this guy.  I can't tell what his intentions are toward me.  Judging from the events of last night, I don't even think he's just doing this to get me into bed.  But everything seems so forced and just weird around him.  I thought things would be different because we were already familiar with one another, but I guess I was wrong.  I didn't belong with him the first time, I guess I don't belong with him again.  I will find someone evenutally I guess.  It's times like this I wish I was still married.

      It's 9:00 pm, and I have no plans to go out.  I'm so boring.  There are times when I feel like I have no friends, and then other times I just want to be left alone.  I called Matt to see if he wants to hang out, but he already had plans with his roommate and the boys, so he's going to go out with them.  But he promised me that we would hang out this coming week.  Just to go out once on a Saturday night would be nice.  Too bad Ryan went home this weekend, or I could see what he's up to.  Ok, I'm going to go be boring now.  Maybe I'll have a more cheerful post later.

      In puttering around on the 'net, I came across this gem of a website:  http://www.teenvote.us  (You'll have to cut and paste into browser because for some reason the link isn't showing up.)   It's a bunch of [what I believe to be] teenagers that are lobbying for the right to vote.  They actually want to change the voting age to 15 or 16!!!  Ok, I appreciate their desire to be involved with politics.  Being a history teacher, I see the value of keeping students informed when they are in high school so they can become productive members of society (aka voters) when they graduate.  But... come on, now.  Giving a 16 year old the right to vote is a dangerous idea.  I deal with teenagers all day.  Most of my kids don't have an original thought in their hormonally-imbalanced little heads.  They just regurgitate what they hear at home or what they hear from their friends, who are equally uninformed.  They believe everything at face value without researching, analyzing, and making their own decision.  Case in point:  the student who believed that African-Americans will lose the right to vote in 2007.  I talked about him the other day.  If I had a nickel for every time a student said that we should bomb the tar out of Iraq, I would be wealthier than Oprah right now.  What's even sadder is that they know nothing about the way this country's government works, or its history.  People need to know these things before they vote.  The whole premise behind these kids' argument is that adults are becoming apathetic and teens should be able to vote because they are the future.  They suggest administering a test that teens that want to vote have to pass.  Fine, kids.  One problem:  I have a feeling that's against the Voting Rights Act.  You can't administer any tests to determine whether or not a person has the right to vote.  That kind of goes back to the day when they gave African-Americans impossible literacy and citizenship tests at the polls so there was no way they would be able to vote.  But nice try.  The scary thing is, Ralph Nader supports this.  Par for the course.  This is the same guy that throws his hat in the race so that Bush won't be reelected... and completely ignores the fact that by doing this, he takes support away from John Kerry.  Hardly anyone will vote for Nader.  He will not become President.  If he continues to run, the US will have to deal with Bushie for another four years, which I don't know if I can deal with.  I might have to go marry a Canadian hockey player and give up my citizenship.  I can't deal with a man who starts a war on a hunch, bases his policies on conversations he has with God, and spends $87 billion on defense when there's people who can't afford health insurance in his own country.  I OFFICIALLY THROW MY SUPPORT TO JOHN KERRY.  He may not be the BEST choice, but then, who ever is.  He's better than Bush.  I can't understand why anyone my age would be a Republican anyway.  All right, enough of my political rant.  I don't know why I get all fired up about these things.  I guess it's good that I'm informed and involved.  There are too many of my peers that are apathetic yet complain about how much this country sucks.  ROCK THE VOTE, MY PEOPLE, ROCK THE VOTE! urlLink

      Ugh... this week seemed so long!  And since it's really warm out, the kids have been especially rammy, even though I'm teaching World War II right now.  Today was a really good day... had a discussion about the decision to drop the atom bom on Japan.  One class broke into a discussion about the treatment of Iraqi prisoners.  Thank heavens I'm against the abuse, because it's the politically correct thing to believe.  A lot of my students have these ultra-conservative views of the world, mostly because their parents do, and they are supporters of Bush without even knowing the facts of the matter.  I was surprised none of them were in favor of the prisoners being abused.  One girl said, "What is wrong with those people [meaning the American soldiers]?"  Those were my thoughts exactly.  Last night I saw the video of the Nick Berg beheading.  Truly the most disturbing thing I have ever seen.  Now I'm not saying I condone the way this poor man lost his life, but there is nonetheless something fishy about his story.  Some points to consider:  1.  Why the hell was he in Iraq by himself?  Don't most telecommunications companies that have these sorts of contracts send several people?  2.  Why was he detained by either Iraqi police or American military for 13 days prior to his kidnapping, and why was he questioned by the FBI during that time?  3.  What were the REAL circumstances behind him being investigated by the FBI in 2002 due to connections with a terrorist?  They explained this on the news last night, but I'm not satisfied with the explanations.  4.  Why was he, a religious Jew, riding around in a taxi by himself in Mosul, with a copy of the Qu'ran on his person?  5.  MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION:  Why didn't he take the US up on its offer to fly him home for free???  I would really like to know the whole story.  I mean, my heart goes out to the family, but this doesn't seem like the same situation as when Daniel Pearl got killed.  Back to the prisoner scandal.  This Lynndie England chick is really gonna get it.  Doesn't she know that you can't go with the "I was just following orders" excuse anymore?  That defense went out with Nuremberg.  And the fact that she is in more than several pictures having sex with multiple servicemen in front of Iraqi prisoners just discredits her even more.  When shown the pictures, her mom said it was "just a prank."  Just a prank my ass.  Anywho...  Finally got the USB cable for the printer so I can finally print out pictures.  Whoo hoo!  Maybe Matt will call tonight or tomorrow to hang out.  What do I get my friend Joe, who is graduating from law school?    Hunger strikes... hope everyone has a great weekend!

      Well, here I am... sitting and typing on my new computer.  I feel so high tech and it's so fast!  I could sit here all night.  Thank God Julie was still home to sign for it so I didn't have to go through the b.s. of sending it to the Pleasantville warehouse so I could go pick it up.  Now I just have to wait for the USB cable for the printer and everything will be just fine and dandy.  :)  Dad got really sick from the chemo that he's taking.  He threw up all night the night before last and then threw up once this morning.  Apparently they're going to give him a shot tomorrow so he'll be all right for the weekend.  It really sucks.    Matt called last night... he's been really busy with all that police academy stuff, but it would be nicer hearing him say that he wants to come over and just see me.  Whatever.  I can't worry about that now.  I guess I'll just have to wait and see what happens.  I'm so hungry but my stomach hurts.  What the hell is that all about?  I think I'll go get something to eat.  Till later!

      Posting here, that is!  I guess I could be boring and sit here and give my entire life story and what's been going on with me for the past 25 years, but I'm not.  It's boring.  So I'll start from today.    Dad had his first treatment with the new chemo and already it's affecting him.  It's giving him neuropathy, which means that he feels extreme heat and cold.  So no more cold water, or hot tea.  Lukewarm everything.  He can't even get something out of the fridge, or he feels like he's getting frostbite.  I hate cancer.  I wish I could make it go away because it's about the worst thing that has happened to me in my entire life.  Hopefully this drug won't make him really sick like the last one did and this will be his last go at chemo.  This one kid got on my nerves today.  For the past two days, he's been telling me that his mother told him that African-Americans will lose the right to vote in 2007.  I told him he's wrong.  He doesn't believe me and insists on arguing with me.  Truth is, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is due to be renewed in 2007, but that prevents polling places from barring people from voting.  This FRESHMAN actually tried to tell me that the Constitution isn't a law.  Thankfully,I found all sorts of websites out there from government sources debunking this myth.  Boy situation is weird.  Matt hasn't called me yet, but I text'd him yesterday saying that I hope he's having fun in rent-a-cop training.  Maybe he's working the bar for money while he's training.  Who knows.  I'd really like to know what's going on, or what his intentions are with me.  I keep saying that I'm going to ask him, because it's not like he's a new guy and I have to been super-careful not to scare him off, but to tell you the truth, I'm scared to death to ask him what he wants from me.  I also wonder what happened to Shawn.  We talked almost every day, but now that he's done student teaching, it's like he forgot I exist.  I know he had a show and Senior Week for PSU to go to, so maybe that's it.  I really miss talking to him, even if it amounts, romantically, to nothing.  So sick of seeing my friends from work attached, that's for sure.  Especially Rebecca with Gene.  Mmmm... hot Marine boy.  He needs to get me a friend or something!  LOL  That's about it for now.  Hopefully the next time I post I'll have my new computer and I'll be living in the lap of high technology!

      Hello!  My name is Sweetheart and I am a parakeet.  Actually, I'm a budgie.  I am just a baby, and I was hanging out with my brothers and sisters, and all of a sudden, a big hand captured me!  I spent a little while in a dark box, then, all of a sudden, I was in a small room and some big human was chasing me around.  I finally got into the cage on my own.  I think the human was a little relieved.  I am still a little scared, but the human comes over to my cage a bunch and says, "Hello, Sweetheart!" and "Pretty bird!" to me.  When she does this, this big white thing (although smaller than the human) comes over, too, and makes a "wooing" sound at me.  The human says the white thing is a dog.  I think its name is Maddie.  I'm sure I can get used to both of them, they seem pretty nice.  Maybe some day I'll even talk to the human. She keeps telling me that she's my human mom.  I can tell she likes me, but I think she gets a little scared when I get scared and try to fly around the cage.  I can't fly real well because the people at the store gave me a haircut so that some of my feathers that help me fly are gone.  They said that it's for my protection.    Ok, I'm going to go play with my toys now and maybe eat a bit.  Talk to you all soon!

      Today was the day of shitty tips.  It was steady all day, but a few tables stuck out in my mind.  First, there was a table of 4 fat white-trash types.  They ordered a bunch of food, and ran my ass ragged for their ranch dressing for their chicken quesadillas (I know, doesn't sound like the most appetizing of choices).  The bill came to $39 and change.  They left me $42 and exact change.  People like that piss me off.  Then came the group from WalMart... a couple of hours late.  I was really good about getting their food and serving them quickly.  Their bill came to almost $80, but they only left me $10.  Bastards.  Thankfully, the people tipping 20% or higher made up for it.  Tomorrow night I work the Kareoke.  I think there's two waitresses on, but I should rake in a decent amount of cash. I also forgot to clock out.  But I remembered that I didn't clock out and called them up and told them.  What a tiring day!  I probably won't post tomorrow, but I'm sure I'll have interesting stories for Saturday.

      Today I made about $50 at work.  Not bad... I guess people were in the mood to give me good tips!  One woman came in just to buy a pint of Absolut and tipped me $2 for ringing her up!  Delores said she always does that for the waitresses, but she doesn't do it for her (because she's the owner).  Delores tended bar today and didn't make me tip her, either.  Tomorrow we have a party of about 10-12 coming in from WalMart.  Hopefully they'll tip me above the 18% gratuity I'm going to tack onto their check.  I'll just have to smile a lot and be extra nice.  I think tomorrow I'm going to bring my vacuum into work.  I hate dealing with that other vacuum cleaner... it's so heavy and it's a beast.  If I have my trusty Oreck, I can vacuum and get ready for the restaurant to open in no time!  Read a lot of crazy nonsense about Scientology today... what a wacky cult!  Ooops... they'll probably blacklist me now.  Oh well.  ;)   Gotta go to bed, it's getting late.  And again, I'm not tired.

      Well, it's official -- I'm officially single again!  I went to court yesterday morning.  It took all of a 1/2 hour and then I headed off to the DMV to renew my driver's license and get the name changed on it.  That was more of a mess than court was!  But I got one of those new-fangled digital licenses that NJ is so proud of, even though everywhere else has had them for ages.  I actually like my picture.  I have a cute smile in it.   The buying the house process is going slowly but surely.  Talked for a while to my landlord yesterday about the loan and my different options.  Hopefully, it will all be done by the beginning of July and I can replace the carpets.  When it's all done, I will be relieved.    All right, I'd better get my butt moving today...

      Work was terrible today.  Since it was so nice, I think most people had BBQs for their fathers.  So I only made like $20.  :(  But the owner is putting me on Wednesdays and Thursdays during the day and Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays at night, so I should be making some good money.  They must have some faith in my waitressing abilities if they're putting me on their busiest nights!  Tomorrow is D-Day!!!  Anyway want to go out???

      Since today is Father's Day, I thought it appropriate to do an entry on my dad.  My dad is my hero.  He married my mom at the ripe young age of 19, and became a father at 22.  He worked hard, sometimes working two jobs, to put me through Catholic school and four years of college.  My dad is not the most emotional of people.  There were times growing up that the only time I heard his voice was when he was yelling at me for talking back to my mother or for doing something stupid.  However, I always knew that he was proud of me and that he loved me more than anything else in this world (except, of course, my mom).  This can be verified in the times that I've seen him cry -- the day I graduated from high school, the day I graduated from college, and when he got to walk me down the aisle on my wedding day.  My dad also would get so nervous that he would get diarrhea everytime something nerve-wracking happened (starting the day my mom went into labor with me LOL), like when I got food poisoning and had to go to the hospital, or when my husband left me.  Sometimes people don't realize the importance of fathers until something serious happens.  Before August 2003, everytime I heard that Baz Lurhman song "Trust Me On the Sunscreen," the line, "The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday," never held any weight to me (well, actually, they meant something on September 11, a Tuesday, but anyway...).  Now those lines make me cry.  I never knew  real  worry and trouble until that day in August, after my dad's colonoscopy, when the gastroenterologist took my dad, mom, and me into the "quiet room" and told us that my dad had a large, and no doubt cancerous tumor in his colon.  I was truly blindsided.  I was blindsided again when the pathologist's report came back -- Stage IV colorectal cancer.  The cancer had completely engulfed 17 of the 24 lymph nodes in the area, and had spread to his liver as well.  Since then, I have seen my father go through surgery as well as heavy doses of radiation and chemotherapy.  Most days he feels terrible; most days he wishes he was dead.  Despite all his shortcomings, my father is a superhero to me.  I can't imagine my life without him in it, and hopefully I won't have to see that day anytime soon.  I am greatful to my Lord Jesus for taking my father this far and bringing this wonderful man into my life.  I only hope that the next man I will marry will be as brave, strong, and loving as my dad has been.  And I only hope that my father will be able to walk me down the aisle when that day comes.  Thank you, Dad, for everything.

      You know what I hate more than anything?  Coward boys that, instead of telling a girl that she's not his type, choose to instead completely ignore her and ruin any chance at a friendship.  Yeah, Craig Sommers, that's right, I'm talking about you.  Fuck you.  You talk a good game, all right, but you're just an immature little boy that needs to get over his issues.  You have a lot to learn before you dive into a real relationship.  Go back to your fucking selfish ex-girlfriend... you two deserve each other.  And, considering that she's only 18, you have about the same maturity level, too.  Ok... whew... I feel better now.  That seriously came out of nowhere.  I was just thinking about the nature of the male gender, and it really pissed me off how immature guys can be.  They are really, for lack of a better word, pussies.  Ok, so I'm being a hypocrite... I have, on occasion, completely ignored a few guys just because I didn't know how to tell them I wasn't interested.  But, mind you, these were among the weirdest guys I have ever met.  Otherwise, I am honest.  If I want to get to know you better, I tell you.  If I don't, I tell you that, too.  The only guy I know that has been brave enough to tell me he's not interested in a relationship is my friend Ryan.  When we first met, there was some... well... flirtation going on.  But he was honest with me and told me that he didn't want anything.  So that "flirtation" stopped.  He also said he wanted to be friends.  We are still friends to this day.  So maybe 99% of guys out there should take a manners lesson from Ryan.  It would do everyone a world of good.  I have to get up early to go cleaning tomorrow with Kristen.  I'm tired again, but not tired.  I hate that feeling.  I either need to go buy myself a bottle of wine, or some Sominex.  I wish they sold wine in the grocery store, like everywhere else.  New Jersey is so backwards -- we don't pump our own gas and we have to go to the liquor store to buy beer and wine.  Plus, they don't have Geico here.  So I can't save a ton of money on my car insurance.  Well, bed time.  Maybe I'll have some more juicy rants tomorrow.

      I only made $20 at work today!  It was so friggin slow that I wanted to knaw my arm off!  It was like, I was looking for things to do, but there was nothing to do.  I ended up helping blow up Corona planes for the Jimmy Buffet ticket giveaway tomorrow night.  I don't have to work again till Sunday at 3.  I have to be there till 10-10:30.  Which means I'll get up to go to court and I'll be soooo tired.  But that's ok, it will be a good tired.  :)  Hopefully I will make more on Sunday night.  :)  I have to do laundry or I won't have any underwear to wear tomorrow.  :-P

      Yeah, ok, so I said I didn't want to be Bridget Jones last night, right?  Well, in the meantime, I struck up a conversation with another Match.com boy.  My age, but WAY more mature than these other goofballs.  I don't even dare risk saying his name for the fear that I will jinx myself into ruining even a friendship with him.  I love Holly.  Even though she's married now, I can still complain to her about guys and she understands.  Plus, she encourages my relationship with God and reminds me that if I give my life up to Him, He will provide.  I have to remember to let live and let God.  Don't get me wrong, though, this is not a blind faith.  Those of you who know me know that I am pretty turned off by "those kind" of people.  Don't think that I've gone Bible-thumper on you all...  I haven't.  :)  Hopefully today at work I'll remember everything I'm supposed to do, and I'll do it quickly.  Every day is a bit better than the last, right?  Maybe I'll even get a chance to eat something, which I didn't the other day.  DAYS TILL D-DAY:  3

      Still no call, no text, no IM.  And guess what?  I'm not going to do a god damn thing about it!!!  Moving on to the next prospect.... Jake, Atco, 21.  Today was my first day of waitressing.  Not a bad job, but I worked my ass off.  I probably worked as much as I did when I worked at the Home Depot.  I made $65 in tips actually waitressing from 11:30 till 3:00.  Not bad at all, Julie says.  Not much else to report.  Feeling pretty damn good about myself, actually.

      Ok, so the first day on the job wasn't too bad...  I was only there for 2 1/2 hours.  The owner, Delores, showed me how to set up the place for the day and how to work the computer.  Tomorrow is my first real day on the job, actually waitressing.  Wish me luck.  Boy didn't call today.  I sent him a text message this morning, saying that I hoped he had a better day and good luck on the test he had to make up.  All I got back was a terse, "Thanks."  Maybe I'm just overreacting.  I always get so worried that no matter what I do, or how hard I DON'T try, things just don't work out.  Take Nic, the Air Force guy, as an example.  That wasn't even supposed to be a long-term thing.  But yet, two weeks before he's set to ship off, he drops me like a bad habit.  I don't know the reason.  He just stopped calling.  I don't even know if I did anything wrong.  Shawn doesn't even talk to me anymore.  God only knows what happened there.  I'm starting to feel like I can't hold it together anymore.  I have so much going on in my life, so much weight on my shoulders, and I can't feel like I can brush it off.  I sit here and I worry about so many things:  my dad, money, love.  It sucks feeling as alone as I do right now.  I wish there was a more poetic way of putting it, but I can't find the words.  It just SUCKS.  Now watch, tomorrow will be better.  That's just the way that it is.  He'll call, and I'll be fine.  I'll realize I overreacted over something so stupid, over a guy I've known for 3 days, and I'll laugh about it.  But... until then... I'll just sit here and wait.

      So I drove up to Brick last night to see Craig.  It wasn't much.  We drove around Brick for about 45 minutes, and then I went home.  Really cute... sweet... funny... nice... but I'm not sure what he thinks about me.  I guess there's always that uncertainty when you meet someone for the first time, especially under those situations.  Maybe I'm just overreacting.  He was nervous and very tired... so maybe that's what made the first "date" kinda awkward.  He said he'd call today, and I have no doubt that he's telling the truth.  He seems to be a sincere guy.  First day of summer, first day of new job.  I'm only going in to see how to set up, though.  I don't think I'm doing any waitressing.  Hopefully this Delores person will remember I'm coming in and will be there.  LOL  I think that if things are cool between me and Craig, I'm gonna ask him to Melissa Marolla's wedding.  Keep fingers crossed.

      It's been a while since I've posted again, but I've been busy, so give me a break.  School ends on Tuesday and I'll be glad to be rid of those little heathens.  Well, not really, but they are getting more and more antsy as the year drags on.  I got a big article in the Current about Key Club so now I'm famous at school.    I got a job as a waitress for the summer.  This should be interesting -- I've never waitressed before!  I watched that movie "Babe" this weekend.  Yes, the one with the pig.  It brought back so many high school memories, like all of the girls saying, "A TRAGIC DAY" in that weird voice we used to do.  I miss high school sometimes.  Back then I didn't have to worry about work, rent, money, or my dad being sick.  Then again, if you hooked up with someone and you didn't end up going out with them, you were a slut.  Big negative.  I talked to my ex-boyfriend from college's college roommate for about a half hour today.  He was pretty nice...  I guess I have to change my thoughts about ex-Theta Chi/Sigma Tau Gamma's.  I didn't tell him who I was right away.  He was like, Did you ever hang out with any of my brothers?  I was like, I went out with one of them freshman year.  At that point, I didn't realize that he had roomed with Gary for 3 years.  I often wonder about Gary -- where he is, what he's doing.  I tried to Google him but it wasn't very successful.  I cared about him a lot and would have liked to remain friends with him, but I guess that didn't happen.  Oh well.  I wonder if Kyle will tell the Ayatollah that he talked to me...  I didn't ask Kyle how Gary was, I didn't want it to seem like a fact-finding mission.  I immed him because he looked familiar.  Anyway...  nothing else to report.

      Not that I went anywhere, but I just haven't posted in a while.  So, let's see... what's new with me?  I started graduate courses again, and it's proving to be a lot of work.  School is almost done.  I have no money.  Julie moved out because she doesn't have enough room (anyone need a roommate?)  I don't have a boyfriend, but I want one.  Someone that used to go out with an ex-friend IMed me out of the blue because he remembered me.  How random is that?  I got carded at a work party yesterday and was extremely embarassed.  I'm insanely jealous of Rebecca's relationship with Gene, even though I know the green-eyed monster is not something that you should let into your life when it comes to your friends.  I'll be divorced two weeks from Monday.  And that's about it.

      I made $100 at work tonight!  Go me!  I had some really excellent tippers, and I thank every one of them for contributing to the "Pay Steph's Bills" fund... LOL  On an even better note...  There is this (what I thought was) very nice older African-American gentleman who comes in pretty often to buy stuff from package goods.  He has nicknamed me "Baby Girl" and is so sweet every time he comes in.  Well, today we got to talking and he asked me how old I was.  He said that I looked 17, so when I told him I was 25, he said I was blessed to be so young-looking, and that I would appreciate it when I am older.  He then proceeded to tell me that his daughter got very depressed when she turned 30.  I was thinking that his daughter was just some regular old person.  He says to me, "You know who my daughter is, don't you?"  I told him I didn't, and he said, "Chilli."  I must have had a confused look on my face, because he elaborated with, "From TLC."  I was starstruck.  He said that he didn't have contact with his daughter for nearly his entire life, and then she found him a couple years back and they went on the Sally Jesse Raphael Show to reunite.  He also told me not to mess with boys my age because they are trash (LOL).  He said that Chilli got involved with a man much younger than she is (yes, he was talking about Usher), and that he cheated on her and broke her heart.  Marty confirmed the man's story, and after doing some research on the 'Net, I confirmed the story myself.  His name is Abdul Ali, and he lives in AC.  He was stationed at Fort Benning when Chilli's mom got pregnant, but he was shipped off before even finding out he was going to be a father.  He is SUCH a nice man and SO proud of his daughter, understandably so.    So there's my little piece of fame.  I still have yet to meet an actual celebrity and talk to them, but at least now I can say that I know a celebrity's dad!

      Geez, I've been so darn busy I forgot to update!  Well... work has been going pretty good.  I haven't made over $100 yet, but the owner said that the summer is pretty weird as far as tips go, especially when it is nice outside and people can go to the beach or Atlantic City.  He assured me that I would make more money when the fall and winter rolled around.  Thank God!  I actually sang at Karaoke last night with Jessie, the other waitress on Fridays.  We sang "I Love Rock 'n Roll" by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.  It was a riot.  Of course, Jessie was still working and I was not... and already had 2 DiSaronno sours working in my system.  Lori, the girl I work with on Saturday nights, quit to go work at the Olive Garden across the street.  After talking to her and then talking to Marty, it's apparent that working in this restaurant is hard for her.  She is used to working in corporate situations (Lone Star, Red Lobster, etc.), so doing everything for yourself is a little much for her.  When you work at a corporate restaurant, you have people to hostess, run the food, and bus the tables.  At the Great American, the servers do all that themselves.  It can get a little hairy, especially when it's busy, but once you get a system down, you're good to go.  Doing everything for yourself also means that you don't have to tip out anyone.  Well, I have to tip out the bartender, but only if I sell enough drinks for it to be worth it.  Since Lori quit, they need me to pick up some more shifts, so I've moved to working 6 days a week.  Yeah, I know, that seems like a lot, but I need the money.  My schedule has moved around, so now I'm working 5 nights and 1 day.  That's the good news -- I only have to deal with Delores one day a week!!!  Even that will be buffered... Susan will be working the bar, and Delores usually chats more with her than being up my ass.  I like dealing with Marty WAY better, obviously.  Speaking of Delores, I'll give you the latest bitching I received from her.  Tonight I go into work and she tells me that no one filled the salad dressings.  I admitted that I forgot to do it last night, and that I would do it as soon as I got a second tonight (mind you, her two daughters who work Saturday afternoons were sitting there doing nothing after telling me it was pretty slow this afternoon--so they could have easily filled dressings).  She then bitches at me because she claimed there was no chocolate mousse pie on the dessert tray in the freezer.  I told her that I sell one dessert a week, if that, so whenever I look in the freezer, the tray is pretty full.  She told me I had to cut pie for desserts as well, and when I asked her how many pieces they usually cut out of the pie, she got surly with me and told me in a most bitchy manner.  The ironic thing is that when I talked to Lori, she said that she had cut pie this week.  I went to go look in the freezer, and the dessert tray was FULL.  There were 5 pieces of chocolate mousse pie on the tray!!  They were all the way in the back, so I guess Delores and her precious princess girls did not bother to look very good.  I am SO going to make her eat crow tomorrow.  Anyway, I'm tired...  ::yawn::  I'll try to update more this week, especially if something interesting happens.  Remember:  always 20%, people!  Us waitresses only make $2.13 an hour!

      Ok, I'm going to explain now why I think my boss Delores is such a bitch.  First of all, she never explained EXACTLY everything I was supposed to do on my shift, and then when I don't do it, I get reamed for it.  No, you heard me right... she doesn't just remind me nicely, she practically yells at me like I'm a child.  For instance, the other night, this woman ordered a prime rib quesadilla.  It says in the menu that it comes with barbeque sauce, so I guess she assumed that the bbq came on the side.  Unfortunately, the sauce is ON the quesadilla.  She ate some of it and then decided that she didn't like it because she thought the sauce was on the side.  She ordered a chicken quesadilla instead.  I threw out her other meal and explained the situation to Delores, and asked her if she could take it off the check.  She actually started yelling at me right there in front of customers and other employees.  She made me feel like total shit.  I told her that I would be willing to pay for the mistake, and she said (in a bitchy tone), "No!  I'm not going to make you pay for it!"  This was, mind you, a day after I really did make a small mistake with an order and she told me that next time I screwed up like that, I was going to have to pay for it out of my own pocket.  She told me I had no authority to throw it out, that next time that happened, I was was going to have to explain to the customer that it was THEIR FAULT they didn't like it, and that they were going to have to take it home with them.  I have never seen this happen in other restaurants.  If you don't like the item, or it's not what you expected, the manager always takes it off the bill.  They don't just tell you "Oh well."  Lori, the girl I worked with the last night, told me that Linda (a waitress that recently left to work somewhere else) was waiting on a couple that felt that their chicken parm was over cooked.  Linda brought it back and apparently Delores actually went over to the table, picking through the chicken, saying "I don't see what's wrong with this chicken!"  Marty, her husband, is the exact opposite.  I had two problems last night.  The first one, the person ordered a "steak sandwich."  It sounded like she wanted the Pub Special (a filet mignon sandwich) without the cheese and onions.  I asked her several times to clarify so I was sure I would get the order right.  Confident that I was punching in the correct order, I brought out what I thought was what she wanted.  Of course it wasn't.  I brought it back and punched in what she really wanted -- a cheese steak without the cheese and onions, on a kaiser roll.  I called Marty over and explained the situation.  I told him that I was sorry, and that I repeated the order back to the woman several times to make sure I got it right.  He was pissed... not at me, but at the customers.  Turns out that they have problems every time they come in.  If it had been Delores, she would have screamed at me.    The other mistake was a drink order and the guy was an asshat and Marty only laughed about it.  Anyway... when I got to work yesterday Delores told me that I have to leave the place "really clean" because we weren't going to be open again till Monday.  I must have given her a "what are you talking about" look [I always leave the place clean when I close the non-smoking side.] because she said, "You left the dishes in the bus pan and the water in the silverware bucket."  I didn't feel like arguing with her.  Truth is, I assumed it was the busboy's job... every time I try to do it for him, he tells me that he'll do it, it's his job.  And... I wasn't the closer on Friday night, and I know Jessie got slammed, so there's a good possibility that she had people eating on that side and she put the dishes in that bus pan.  Delores is a stupid bitch.  I guess I'll just have to do the "smile and nod" thing until she really steps out of line and then I'll talk to Marty about it.  Lori just got a job at the Olive Garden, so she'll be leaving.  Maybe I can pick up her shifts at night.  I think I would rather work with Marty anyway.  Ok, it's 1:40 and I'm still in my pj's.  Gotta go get a shower.  Happy 4th of July everyone!

      This is going to be quick since I need to get to bed...  Sweetheart is now perching on my finger in the cage... go budgie!  My boss Delores is a bitch, and I'm not the only one who things so.  Now I realize why no one wants to work during the day with her.  One of these days I'm going to tell her off.  Boy who was remaining nameless told me tonight that he has been dating someone on and off.  I'm glad he told me... he let me know that he wanted to be friends and didn't want to lead me on.  Nice guy.  Moving on...  my birthday is Tuesday and it looks like I'll be celebrating by getting drunk with Ryan on Monday night.  Anyone care to join??    Time for bed...
