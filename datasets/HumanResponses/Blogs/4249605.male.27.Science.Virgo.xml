       So, we are on the medals board of the 28th Olympics,  HURRAH !! It is a silver no less and for those of you thinking "Big Whoop", it is a bi...g whoop indeed, this being the first siver medal our country has had post-independence (thats 57 years folks). Congrats to Rajyavendhra Rathore on the feat!       All of us Indians know what will happen next. Rathore will transiently dethrone the cricketing heroes and have his fifteen minutes of fame. But this is India folks, where hockey might be the national sport on paper (wonder if today's kids know that) but cricket is definitely the overwhelming favorite. Rathore will soon be relegated to the quiz books and Tendulkar will be on top again. Do not mistake me, I have all the respect for our cricketers for the glory they've brought us but we need to do better. Look at how the other sportspersons are languishing while cricketers are raking in the moolah. The government and private sponsors need to step in and turn things around big time or else we'll be the laughing stock of the world. Seventy-odd atheletes in the Olympics from a country of 1 Billion -  come on ! I do sound like an armchair quarter-back but hey, someone's gotta tell the truth.      I don't play any sport, by the way, and thats because when I was a kid, playing was considered to be a waste of time. You were supposed to be burning the midnight oil instead or else the next door kid would score 0.1% more than you and get that coveted medical seat. Things have improved in India, I guess, so we should expect an Olympic gold in the next 25 years??!!

        Hello Everybody!   Welcome to my foray into the world wide web.  Most of you visiting this page would be my close friends and family and so a lot of this won't be new. For others, this is a peek into who I am and what I do.  I was born in Chrompet, a suburb of Chennai (India) on the fourth day of September, 1976 to Ramaswamy Kalyanaraman and Seethalakshmi. I am blessed to have parents who gave me a great education and inculcated in me the values of honesty, hard work and equanimity. I owe all my successes to them. I have a younger sister, Padmapriya (Priya, for short) who has been and will always be my favorite punching bag. An elder brother is not exactly your favorite person when growing up, and I have the feeling I never got to know her much. All the same, I love her a lot and wish her every happiness.  I'm a happily married man (whoever said "you can be either happy or married"??!!). Me and my wonderful wife of three years, Sasi, are expecting our first joint venture to arrive in March 2005 and you're damn right we're excited! We live in Cincinnati, Ohio which has been home to us for the last two years. We came here from Chennai in India in the fall of 2002, me to pursue a Ph.D in Biomedical Engineering and Sasi, for her Masters in Health Promotion and Education. By the way, both of us are MDs, and for those who're thinking  "what the hell are they doing?" , I'll tell you - we're having fun!  I did my schooling in St. Paul's School, Begusarai (Bihar) and SRDF Vivekananda Viyalaya, Chennai. I went to medical school at Kilpauk Medical College, Chennai and graduated with MBBS in 2000. Thats where I met my future wife and the rest is history. Presently, I'm training in the field of Tissue Engineering, which is a relatively new kid on the block. In simple english, we are in the endeavor of designing and growing organs in the lab so that one day we can have a "Bodyzone" of human spare parts and not rely on organ donors. I'm working with Dr. Steven Boyce, who has pioneered a method to fabricate skin grafts from donor cells which is proving to be life-saving for burns victims. Presently, my focus is on automating the cell-culture process and designing an incubator-cum-transport vessel for the skin grafts. In the future, I plan to work on growing hair in the cultured skin, making allografts immunologically inert and gene-therapy through the skin grafts.  When I get time-out from studies, I like to watch movies, sleep, but most of all, just to chatter away to glory with my wife! Yeah, I heard you, what a bore! But this is the way I like it.  Thats it about me. I shall come back with more interesting information in future posts.  BK
