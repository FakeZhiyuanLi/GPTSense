         At the age of 23, I was barely making it financially.  Yes I owned a small place, but I earned a low salary that barely helped me get to the end of the month.  Once a month or every 2 months my mom bought me stuff at the groceries.  I was lucky because I used a uniform at work, which the hotel cleaned for me, and they provided one meal a day.  Food was not the best, but there was a slight selection.  I am getting off subject of what I wanted to write.  I lost weight, smoked, and dated a loser.  Finally I was lucky enough (I can say that now) to be dumped before Christmas 1993.  In February I ended up going to Cancun, instead of Rio de Janeiro, and I met Steve.  I did not want to meet any guy, after my recent break-up, but things happen for a reason.  I thought I would never see him again, so I had fun for intense 3 days.  As it turns out we continued talking on the phone, and I received weekly letters.  If e-mail would have been accessible, we would have communicated even more.   After six months, impulsive Clau, decided to sell some things and come to the US.  I thought what if he is the one?  And also I had many things that helped me make up my mind easily.  My mom was getting on my nerves calling me 10 times a day asking me for advice she never followed.  My brother's life style was messed up.  He is gay and was involved in promiscuous, abusive relationships.  I did have lots of friends that were excited about my romance, so they were pushing me to do it.  At one point I remember saying: If everything works out, I quit smoking! I was so excited.  There were 2 reasons to consider staying in Argentina: my grandparents and my recent closeness to my dad. My grandparents had been the support since pretty much I was born, and gave me ethic, moral and love guidance.  My mom never expressed affection to me, but specially my grandpa showed me love every second.  I lived 2 blocks from their place as a kid, and I would rather be with them than with my school friends.  My grandpa has always been my hero.  He arrived to Argentina with nothing, and worked nonstop until he no longer couldn't.  He had these amazing stories that I could hear for hours.  I played cards with my grandparents and had a blast.  If they were one of the reasons to stay, it all changed in the month of July 1994.   On July 1, I went to see my grandparents and had along conversation with my grandpa, in which he apologized for not being able to give me money to bring to the US and help me.  My mom had spent all the money he had sweat for.  I told him I was a woman, and I could provide for myself.  I told him not to worry about me, because I was a fighter and I was independent.  He looked relieved and happy.  That night I went out, it was hot, and I mixed alcoholic beverages.  I was very sick.  The next morning the phone rang to announce that my grandpa had died of a heart attack, ironically when he was showing a picture on the wall of the house were he had been born in Germany.  My mother or brother were gone, so I was the one in charge.  That was not uncommon, since I've always been the mature of the three of us.  My life stopped, it was as if a dagger cut open my heart.  A few days later, after the funeral and all, I talked to my mom.  She was feeling guilty for having spent all his money, and thought that it caused his death.  I felt peace for having had that conversation with him the day prior to his death, but my hero had died.  My grandma got sick, and died on July 31st, just three weeks later.  They've been together 51 years, so it's not surprising.  After my grandparents were gone, my reasons to stay grew even smaller.  I thought that by trying to make it in another country, I would be repeating my grandpa's story.    The one force remaining for me to stay was my recent connection with my dad.  After many trials and failures to have a relationship with him, I called him and we met for coffee.  I don't remember exactly if I called or he did.  I was amazed by what he told me.  As a young girl, I was convinced that he didn't want me in his life and he didn't love me.  My mom always guilt tripped me, and I believed everything she said.  I was not a girl anymore, and my strong instinct told me that he was sincere.  I started a close connection, only to discover how similar we are even though I grew up without him.  The bad qualities and the good ones, jealousy, gredge, stubborness, humor, strength, happiness, tenderness, dorkiness, you name it.  After a long time I understood why I was so different from mom and Rodrigo.  Many years earlier I wrote him a poem wishing for him to love me, and there it was...  He cared!  Still, I decided to come to the US.  I figured if he loved me, he'll continue to do so.  After 10 years he's the main reason for me wanting to go back.  But that comes in the next chapter.  Stay tunned

      Wow,I thought it would be easier to start by traveling through my life, starting from the beginning.  I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina almost 35 years ago.  My mom and dad were together up until I was 3 years of age.  I have a younger brother with whom I have periods of silence and resentment, and others not bad.  When my parents divorced, I was told that I was really angry for not seeing my dad for over 6 months. Apparently, after I saw him I came back with strabismus.  Being crosseyed has always bother me a lot, until finally last summer I had surgery, and I am much better now.  My mom re-married Ricardo, a Uruguayan musician and composer.  He was very creative and nice at the beginning.  During the eight years my mom was married to him, she made me feel very guilty about seeing my dad maybe once or twice a year.  Ricardo overtime became violent, and started to physically abuse my mother and I in particular. I don't remember anything happening to Rodrigo.  I remember trying to fall asleep at night and hearing him hitting my mom, and her pleading for help.  I also remember a couple times in the middle of the night, getting us together and telling us we were leaving the house.  He never worked, and my mom didn't either at that time.  They/we were living of my grandpa's tremendous effort.  He arrived to Argentina from Germany with nothing and built his own little empire.  Ricardo went through a face that he was following the macrobiotic diet.  I will never forget as long as I live that one day I asked him for money to buy candy and he slapped my face and threw his wine on top of m,y school uniform.  I had to go to school after lunch and stinking like an alcoholic...  After eight years my mom finally divorced.   I start a new paragraph because my life completely changed between the time I was eleven until pretty much I was 24.  My mom had depression and sometimes spent days vomiting by her bed with a bucket on her side.  Another thing that happened is that she became very promiscuous, and slept with almost a different man every night.  When I was 12 she told me to smoke pot that it was not addicting.  As a way of rebellion I never wanted to try it. As I became older every time I went out and came back, I would see a jacket hanging on the livingroom's chair.  I knew that man was sleeping with my mother.  A couple times I called her "puta", she slapped me and told me that it's either men in her room or her vomiting.  Of course I could not say much.  I started to be silent and to absorb all the things that were going on.  God, I was so embarrassed of my mother in public.  She used to dress with mini skirts and spandex tops...  My friends had good families, so I felt alienated and did not talk much.  I wrote some, but there was less writing than thoughts and feelings.  I started college many careers, but no one told me the importance of getting a college degree.  At the age of 24 my mom sold the big apartment and bought 2, one for me and one for her.  She wanted to live alone.  I felt less cared for than before.  I know I was 23, but I was more alone than ever.  My brother had always been my moms reason of being, and ironically he is the one that has made her suffer the most.  Ever since I was born, the role model and person I admire the most has been my grandpa Leo.  I guess, since I was little I was ambitious, hard working and loving like he was.  If it wasn't for the stable home of my grandparents I could have turn to drugs, sex or alcohol.  I look back, and I know that many people have it worse, but I don't understand where I had the strength to endure all of those tough days...  I will continue at another time.

        Today was another Saturday in my life. I spent quality time with Steve... we went to have lunch to his buddy's place in downtown San Leandro... we later went to Tapioca Express and I bought some milk tea for my buddy and dropped it off at the mall... I saw her for just a bit, but it was nice... At 5 we went to Union City to watch  The notebook. I've been wanting to watch it for six weeks. I don't know why, but I knew that it was my kind of movie. I haven't seen such a great movie in years!!! I am not the kind of person who buys DVDS, but as soon as this one is out, I want to buy it!!!!    After watching the movie, I wished that my love for Steve was as strong as the love Alley and Noah had. I normally tear in almost any movie, but in this one I cried rivers... It's a must see... an old times like love story. When the movie ended, everyone, or at least so it seemed, was crying. It was cathartic and woke up my romantic side. It also deals with Alzheimers, and the choice to die when ur body is giving up. If I were very sick or had a devastating disease I would choose to die. But as long as I am relatively healthy, I will never leave this world... even if at times I wish I would be gone... I cannot be so selfish to leave when some people count on me... at times I think that's not the case... but when I am sharp I realize that they do...the quick fix would be to take your life so you no longer have to feel... I am not such a coward... or I am one because I could not even try to end my life...even at the darkest moments there is a tiny glimmer of hope... life is a miracle every day... each day should be the first day of that miracle... whoever reads this, specially you Teesa, I love you and need you lots... don't you ever leave me alone in this sometimes cruel world...

        Today was a day that I wished at many times would end. I wish I could just disappear, so I didn't have to feel or think certain things. The only moment that I seemed to be ok was when I saw Teesa. I was on the verge of crying when I arrived to pick her up. The reason was absolutely stupid: just listening to a cd made me feel incredibly sad about being an Argentinean... then I thought about my dad and his disease...what if the only positive figure in my family dies?...why? yes he's abused tobacco forever, but why would it happen? My mind was racing kind of continuing with yesterday's thoughts.        Somehow, little by little Teesa (with her powers) managed to make me      forget for a while and we had a nice time. After I left her at her house, anguish came back. Maybe I'm pmsing badly, and I try to find a logical explanation when there's none. During the evening I texted Teesa and she helped me feel a little better. At around 8 I called her without anything to say. I hate those times, because I feel I am boring her to death and I called just to pass time. I like when we engage in interesting topics and after talking I feel: wow that was nice... When I am so negative I can never have engaging conversations. why? I wanted to talk some more, I was hungry for one of those conversations. Maybe Monday... if nothing happens so that plans are cancelled. I love my buddy, today my mood was such that I couldn't even tell her I loved her without feeling shy and out of place. Well, tomorrow has to be a better day...

       Today was a fine day!  I saw my best friend.  At the beginning we juast stared at each other without much to say.  It was very comforting to see each other, but we were getting acquainted with our new looks.  Hers is more drastic than mine! She is beautiful no matter what.  After wtaching TV, I let her read the poem.  I've never written a poem to a friend before, she is truly special.  I also showed here the pics and gave small green gifts.  It could not be another color, right?  We went to lunch, and I let her drive through Alameda.  She's actually pretty good!  When we arrived home time was running short, so we did our favorite thing to do: lay in the couch next to each other.  I enjoy that because we are close in body and spirit.  It was almost like a mother daughter situation, Teesa fell asleep on my shoulders!  What's amazing is that I know how hard it is for her to sleep, and being with me relaxed her to the point she could do that.  It made me very happy!  I wish we could have some more of those moments before school starts...  Maybe next Monday?  I don't know.  Besides that nice moment something really important happened: we made a pact.  I will not smoke not even 1 drag, and she will not cut herself even one small cut.  Smoking and cutting are two self-destructive habits we have that need to die forever.  It will work!  I hope from the bottom of my heart that she does NOT let me down, because it could be extremely painful to overcome.  She has my trust and I have hers; we are very vulnerable, but at the same time we are two tough women.  I believe in us!  I love us!

       It was easy to make the decision to move to the U.S. given everything I've been talking about. My relationship with my dad was way too recent to change my mind. Creating a separation from my mom was what I thought I needed. It was like being free at last... My mom called me at my job at least 7 times a day, it was overwhelming. I thought leaving would be getting rid of my past problems. Well, in reality I carried them in my luggage... I was too impulsive to make the decision to leave my beloved Argentina, but in a way I felt I had no other way of putting my life back together; or better yet, starting to live! I desired so much to come here that I said I would quit smoking... I did. Yes, every time I go I start, but I quit again.   When I came to the U.S. I moved in with Steve without knowing him really. I was gutsy, but otherwise I couldn't. He introduced me to all his friends, and I remember people would not touch or kiss... They hugged in such a fake way that I felt so awkward! I missed and still do the physical contact we have in Argentina. Even if you don't know people, when they are introduced to you by a friend you kiss them on the cheek. Steve went back to work kind of quickly. At the beginning I went to do some sightseeing in SF, but after a while I was like afraid or lonely. I used to stay home and watch soap operas, and by the time Steve got home I asked 20 questions before he could answer the first one! I've always been the kind of person that when I have too much time, I think crazy... After spending some money in shopping at The Gap (because in this country they carry my size, at that tiem was between a 10/12,) I started searching for a job. I thought since I spoke some languages and had experience in Tourism and Hotels, I could get that kind of jobs. But very soon that dream fell apart. In Argentina I would have never worked at a coffee shop, especially cleaning and doing dishes. Finally, I decided to search for a job at a coffee shop. I thought it would be easy, but without papers it wasn't. One day Steve got me job through a friend at Sweet Joana's cafe Howard and Spear. Every day I took the bus, and went to my daily humiliation session. The wife of the owner was very mean to me. At first I was troo shy to ask people to repeat what they have ordered when I didn't understand. I got better over time. Her husband and brother in law liked me and were nice, but she was a bitch. I worked there for a while until one day the bitch told me that business was slow, so they could no longer pay me. The husband hooked me up with another brother of his at the Fisherman's wharf. Things there were different. I was given lots of wasing to do of huge, sticky muffin trays. At least I had someone to talk to, a Mexican girl (Yadira). Customers liked me and I was not shy anymore, but I worked like an ass. The owner sometimes cussed at me behind my back in arab, but always smiled and pretended that everything was ok. He called me wet back, and I had no clue what that meant. Everything continued until one day I was told that a new girl will start ,and I will have less hours and will have to work weekends, so I quit impulsively. I told him I had a better job offer. I had nothing, but my ego was still strong.   Weeks after I found a job close to where I lived (a block away). The owner was Egyptian. I had to prepare food, coffee, clean, mop, you name it. Very soon I was in charge of everything and by myself. Omar would only come once a day if that. Customers loved me, and although the job was demanding I was happy. Business was slow at times and friends from the building came to visit, like the lesbian that made moves on me and Guillermina who got offended by my words... Just an Argentinean expression that it is offensive in Mexico. She was nice. One day, I went to work and the store was empty, Omar moved out the night before. To make things short, talking to some cutomers a Korean man offered me a job in a Blue CHip Cookie store he was opening soon. I went to Argentina in the time being, and started working upon return. I had moved out Steve's place, but when I lost my job, he told me to go back. I worked there for a bit, and Steve offered me to get a Civil Wedding to get my papers. I applied for a job at Office Depot and got it. It was ok. After 4 months Steve proposed with a ring, and asked me to get a degree. I started shyly, but college woke up a part of myself that had been quiet. I went to community college, got my AA, and transfered to Cal State Hayward. I wanted to go to UC Berkeley, like Trish, but I needed to stay one year to finish one class. I knew that no matter where I went I would do good if I just set my mind to it. And I did. I graduated Summa Cum Laude. After graduating I got in a program to receive my teacher's credential, and I did. I've been teaching for 3 years, and I don't think I would do anything else, although it could be stressful at times. THe chase of a dream has been tough, and many times I wanted to throw the towel... I did not, and as I look back I feel proud! No one in my immediate family has received a college degree. In a way what I did is so similar to what my grandpa did... He is and always will be my inspiration...

        I hate when technology overcomes me! It's the fucking third time I'm writing this blog. I need to be tech smart! Well, the blog's topic was the continuation of my last one. I wrote about the positive influences I had that help me endure tough times. This 2 forces were Mirta and Marta. Mirta was my nanny in my early childhood until I was 11. She was my friend Mirta's grandma. She was there for me, and took my side when she thought I was right. My mom never heard her, and punished me for things my brother did. My buddy Mirta told when I saw her recently in Argentina, that I was always grounded... I was grounded for stuff Ro had done, but my mom always preferred him over me. My mother and brother went out to have fun while I stayed home punished with Mirta. I kind of liked the peace at the house, but   as time went by I grew apart from my mother. It's hard to have feelings today, even if my mother is trying to do the right thing, because she did not plant the necessary seeds or water the plant correctly when it was necessary. It is hard to show affection, when we never did...    Marta was another positive force in my adolescence. She was my nanny from 12 on. She has always been like a big sister. She took my side a lot, since mymom went crazy during my teenage years. We fought at times, but minutes later we were having "Mate" and laughing. I learned to cook by watching her, although I took a couple classes with famous chefs from 1992 to 1994. Marta was there when I needed guidance, and gave me advice when I was loosing it. She adopted Carlitos when he was 2. I used to take him to places, and when I saw him recently I could not believe how big he's got! He's 16! My mom always thought that Marta was partial to me, so she never listened when there was any issue w/ Rodrigo. At least someone that favored me! My mom slapped me in the face when "I went out of control." With time, I started to laugh, no matter how much I was hurting. She stopped.
