      my blood&nbsp;runs cold. maybe cause i just worked out. its important to work out your physical heart and your spiritual heart so they can be as equally strong. there diffantly has to be a real balance in&nbsp;your body . right and left arm need to be the same strength. right and left leg need to be the same strength. all four parts of your brain . were need to excersise the weaker parts of our brain , becuase its good for you to "be strong... as well as courageus. "&nbsp;&nbsp;and aparently i need to excerise my spelling skills...as well as my math skills. but our innner person (spirit) needs just as much excersice as your outter person. its not your brain im talking about. but your spirit . who is the Holy Spirit. but if you don't have the Holy Spirit in you, you dont even have a spirit at all . because there is no other. which is why people feel so empty and misplaced. their lacking what God intended them to lack. HIM. Hes not going to fill them (you) unless you freely , honestly and truthfuly want him to. his too gentle to push him self on you. there is a real balance in Gods works ..if you draw closer to him he will draw closer to you. thats a promise. pray that you are able to understand his laws of life. and the mercies toward you.

       She told me this would be good for me to write out my thoughts and try to organize my crazy way of thinking. so here we go. for the world to read. i have now idea where to start. i have always loved talking about the heart. so i guess ill start there . the greatest place to&nbsp;be is close to God. oh how i need to clear&nbsp;out my heart.

        me, veronica and lee watched "we sold our souls for rock and roll part 2" if you have ever seen it - its so upsetting...aaahhh . its very true, but non the less up setting. i encourge you to get your copy of it, watch it&nbsp;, be upset enough to not listen to secular music any more. if its not God (Jesus) whorshipping you shouldn't be listening to it.( call&nbsp;that hard core , what ever)&nbsp;we are children of God. fill your ears with such music. don't forget his mighty promises ... He loves you (anyway). focus on him. it makes me want to vomit when i think of all the dead babies people kill in the name of selfishness. aahahahhahhhhahaaaaahhhh....seriously, God is big enough to make a way to provided for your ( HIS ) child. and if you forget how big   He is.    read isiash .. 41:10....     or he would be a lier. then what i believe is all in vain. but hes not a lier. he's real. he's my Father. he always makes a way . &nbsp;Praise the Lord my&nbsp;Father Jesus Christ &nbsp;... e-mail me if you need to talk. me_and_myself7@hotmail.com   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       hes (jesus)&nbsp;been teaching things about my heart latly.. its good stuff it really is . im asking him to turn the tables over in my heart . to knock over the things ive been distracting myself with in the deep corners of my heart.    theres a cool hand luke song that says "jesus turn these tables over" and its talking about the same thing. in those deep nasty corners of my heart that only God can see . and that i let no enter some times not even my own self. Jesus you rock my world. &nbsp;
