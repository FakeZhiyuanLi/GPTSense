      What a weekend that was. Friday out went Mr.Spid on his work's night out, I spent the night on the net whilst trying to have a spilff, tonsillitis don't like smoking so that didn't go well. Bugger. He came home around half four in the morning not half as pissed as I thought he would, and so we went to bed.   I awoke at stupid o'clock (6 am) Saturday, I reckon it was the excitement from knowing I was off to Clarence park that very day. So I got up finally decided on what I was wearing, sorted my overnight stuff out and got ready. Mr.Spid Woke up about 11.30am, because I'd made him breakfast. So all ready off I set to wakey on the bus, an hours journey no less! Anyway I got to wakey and then came the task of getting to Clarence park, I'm useless at finding places I walked all the way down to thornes park college, all way through the grounds over the huge hill to the park where I found a load of people listening to a band called AB Negative, a punk band who are quite good check em out here  urlLink http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/abnegative . Then there were some bands on that I didn't like, can we all say pants? And so the day carried on with me giggling muchly at my mate's saying things that I turned into sexual innuendo, my usual self. Then to my amazement a good band came on Swine who haven't got a website but they are excellent, if you get a chance go see em, there a legend in wakey!   And the next band are so good they deserve their own paragraph, the one and only GORE! This is the second time I've seen these guys perform and my god there good. Their sounds a bit heavy for some people but not for me. They make me laugh, the lyrics are genius. And so is there stage performance, they never fail to amuse. The lead singer came into the crowd on the last song, I was bewildered by such actions, I saw him disappear stage left and could still hear him I was thinking where's he gone then, and was stood watching the bass player do his stuff and giggling, when I turned to my left to see someone in a blooded apron with a guitar, my thought's was oh there you are, and then fucking hell what are you doing there! So he finished replace my face with a pizza base in the mosh pit. I walked back to where all my mate were sat when he was crowd surfing. All in all an excellent set, I will see them play again and again, I'm getting to be quite the GORE whore, he he. Check em out here  urlLink http://www.goruguay.com/ . They rule indeedy.   And so by this point baby Tyler, sash's ickle one was getting tired so back to her house we went (the we is me her, baby Tyler and Toby). Taxi ride later we were there, I realized how far out of the way I'd walked, bugger! Anyway, we were all a bit snickered and Tyler was hungry and tired so sash fed the baby, and then we popped to the off-license for alcohol, yah. Got back in Tyler got ready for bed. Once he was in bed sash made me some scrambled egg's I hadn't eaten all day, fucking tonsillitis! After said egg's I cracked open the alcohol bought from the local offy hmmmm blue wkd is yummy.&nbsp;So a large amount of alcohol later I can't remember bugger all, some things filtered through, sash being on msn with Karl, me giggling at the conversation, god knows what was said though. I can also remember being loud, apparently sash put Eddie Izzard on for me to watch, but I never shut up long enough to listen to it, he he.   So at some point I passed out asleep, I awoke on the sofa my phone was ringing, it was 8.05am! Mr.Spid Was on the phone asking what time busses were at to get him and baby Spid through to wakey. About two hours later there he was knocking on the door. So we sat in sash's for a bit trying to wake up, Toby was a bit worse for wear, he'd had half a bottle of brandy! Sash was&nbsp;knackered. Got down to the park just to see waking the witch going off, didn't hear much to comment on them, shame we missed ninepoundnote though, from what I've heard on there site there rather good check em out  urlLink http://www.ninepoundnote.tk/ .&nbsp; So bands that day I saw were Malibu Stacey, fookin excellent band, there gonna be big soon, catch em whilst you can, the cockpit in Leeds 11th august! Check out the site at  urlLink http://www.malibustacey.com/ &nbsp;its worth it. Mr.Spid Took baby spid to the loo while they were on, and then down to the front of the stage to see em play. Apparently she was mosshing, doing the rock sign and giving em the thumbs up, much to the amusement of the guitarist. I was sat on the hill, and missed all this. Grrr. Still blinding set it was. Then came Cobain, fuck me sideways again, there excellent, nirvana tribute band if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you didn't guess, I love nirvana I have for years, I wanna see these guy's again, you've got to hear to believe how close they are to the originals check em out at  urlLink http://www.cobainrock.com/ . After that set which baby spid wasn't keen on for some reason, me her and Mr left for home, calling in the taxi office for my bag, I'd left it in the taxi on the way to Clarence, bugger. Still I got it back ok and then we went for the bus, we got back about 7.30 I think. I was tired, so I posted a ickle bit on darklings and vegged out on the sofa. Then eventually went to bed, exciting init. I'm not very good at this rock and roll decadence am I? Still a most excellent weekend all round. Rock on peeps  urlLink            urlLink

      Well its taken a week to come around again, but it's finally here, FRIDAY! And that means only one thing, tomorrow's Saturday, and not only is it Saturday its Clarence park Saturday.&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;  So I have a weekend of drink, drugs and rock and roll ahead so can't wait. I get to see GORE again, one of the most entertaining bands I've seen for a while. So anyway that's what's to come.   Yesterday was peaceful, I spent most of the day alone as my mum had baby spid for me, she's a star. I played my guitar for a bit, I've got the start of a rather funky riff going on and I learned the beginning riff to highway to hell. I'm rather proud of myself. So anyway, I'm gonna see what to wear for Clarence now, hmmmmm this may take a while.   Have a good weekend peeps.&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;        urlLink

      So I'm still ill, in fact I feel worse&nbsp;today than I did yesterday, I awoke to AC/DC playing at full volume from the alarm clock, its got a setting so you can play a CD rather than that annoying buzz. So I awoke with a smile at least. I soon found that I can't swallow properly and my headache was the worst its been so far. I've had this since Monday and it don't look like its shifting. Anyway I came downstairs and forced down painkillers, which almost made me sick, and got some warm ribena and a lovely throat lozenge. My mum had baby spid last night so I I've had a free morning without having to rush her to school and I'm not picking her up either I haven't got her while 2, I'm gonna go clean upstairs in a bit, I'm gonna&nbsp;enjoy some peace and quiet first though. Might play my guitar for a bit as well, see if I can write anything interesting, hmmmm GUITAR!

      I must have had the worst nights sleep ever last night. I have tonsillitis and I feel like crap. So about 7 ish I go to bed for a lie down cause I ache everywhere and my head hurts. At this point Mr.Spid is sat on the sofa looking at some wrestling sites on the net, with baby Spid sat next to him. Mr.Spid knows how ill I am and yet sat there whilst baby Spid followed me up and jumped up and down on the bed til I gave up on going to sleep. So back downstairs I went. Baby Spid went to bed at 8ish and decided she wasn't tired so sat watching a film in her room.   Meanwhile Mr.Spid and I decided to watch a film, so I sat there watching this film in it entirety, while Mr.spid decided to fall asleep. So about 11 the film finished and we decided to go to bed, me in bed at 11pm shocking. On walking upstairs we found baby Spid to be wide&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; awake still watching films in her room. And so Mr.Spid jumped in bed and&nbsp;started snoring immediately. Leaving very ill Spid to try and get&nbsp;baby spid&nbsp;to sleep so I put her in her bed turned the light off and said goodnight. I then went and sat in our bed and listened out&nbsp;for any movement from&nbsp;our room. She decided she was gonna get in bed with us much to Mr.Spid's objections, which lasted about an hour of shouting and&nbsp;such like. So I finally got to sleep having no bed and an even bigger headache. Only to be woken up several times during the night and at about 4am waking up in agony&nbsp;due to a small child's feet in my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back and almost being on the floor. So I came downstairs for pain relief and sat reading the darklings site till they kicked in and then went back to bed for a few hours. So suffice to say I'm bloody knackered now. Oh well another day init.

      I've got tonsillitis, I feel like crap and I just want to go to bed.&nbsp; urlLink     I hate being ill, I haven't the time for it. I even went to bed at 12.30 last night, not normal for me at all. I'm gonna go to the chemist in a bit and get something for it. A gun with a single bullet would do I reckon. So I'll toddle off and feel sorry for myself now.&nbsp;        urlLink

      It wasn't too shabby. Saturday went to see spiderman 2, which is quite a good film. Twas a tad too soppy for me, I wasn't in the mood for all that yucky love stuff. Baby Spid enjoyed it, but found Doc Ock a little scary. I must have missed some of the best bits taking her to the loo cause she got frightened, Gah.  &nbsp;  Sunday was quite uneventful, not a problem that's what Sundays are for. Next weekend will change all that, its Clarence park you see. And I can't wait, more info here  urlLink http://www.themusiccollective.co.uk/index.php . Defiantly worth a visit, I mean come on its free and threes some kick arse bands playing.  &nbsp;  Just got to get though the week now..............

      Well I was baby sitting for my best mate last night, which I feel quite honored about, she doesn't ask just anyone to do it. So&nbsp; went over put baby to bed at 7 and sat and watched TV for a few hours whilst she came&nbsp; back from band practice. Oh yeah check out her band  urlLink http://www.seraphic.org.uk/ &nbsp;there very good.  &nbsp; So it was almost 10 when she got back by which time I was tipsy and on the way to being mashed, and had the munchies. So we decided on pizza, I think we may have come up with the best topping ever, wait for it, Bacon, Chicken Mushrooms and garlic butter, yum.  &nbsp;  And I came home to find my baby, guitar had been resprayed and cleaned. Yay, I now have a black guitar with a silver pick plate, it looks rather cool, still plays like shit though............  Guitar&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;        urlLink

Didn't do much of anything yesterday to baby spid to school picked her up, same old same old. Got her school report though, she's doing really well, I'm so proud. Big smiles all round. urlLink

      Not really, well not in real life anyhow, got a game for Mr.Spids PS2 yesterday. Singstar, karaokie type game it is. I started a career game and apparently I'm not that bad, I'm sure it scores you on whether you know the words rather than can sing the tune though. I can't sing for toffee and I have a number one single, maybe it is real life then, hmmmm.  Saw my best mate yesterday, which was fun we caught up on the week and had a smoke. I forgot my mates birthday card due to the fact I was told by my friend that it was another friends birthday that day, its not its a month as yesterday. Gah.  There was a memorial service for my gran today, I didn't go. There are many reasons for my non-attendance to this, not a happy spider this afternoon or indeed tonight. But still if my gran was still here she'd kick me up the arse for feeling sorry for myself so I won't.  Well it's been fun, goodnight  urlLink

      Had to re-sort all our bill's yeasterday seeing as I'd cancelled all the direct debits when we had our little spat a few weeks ago, stupid of me not to sort it straight away I know but its done now, even if it has left us with slightly less money than we had before. I find the council tax frankly ridiculess, even more so now that the council are transfering all the housing to an agency sometime next year.  Did bugger all yeasterday, staying in with ill baby spid and spent for too much time on 'tinternet as usual. Caught up with and old friend the day beofre which was nice, they better keep in touch this time round too.   I've got birthday cards to buy today for two freinds one for tomorrow and one for the 13th, for which I was supposed to be going on the piss in birmingham for, but alas im not going now. Still I'm sure they'll have a great time without me. Hopefully gonna get out myself need to speak nicely to mum and/or Mr.Spid, we shall see, im not getting my hopes up.  urlLink

      Well baby Spid has tonsilitis as suspected, we now have two bottles of yucky orange stuff for her to take, yet she refuses to swallow any of the stuff. She's had me up most of the night crying that her throat hurts, but yet wont swalow the pain killer shes being offered. I've been covered in orange stuff at least 3 times since we got back yesterday.  In lighter news I bought McFlys new album yesterday, its quite good imo. Its sort of poppy-britpop. Still havent done my secret CD, Im at a loss with that one.  Don't know what todays going to bring, we'll see as it unfolds won't we.

I can barley speak first thing let alone get dressed and move. Well at least I got through it, today is aother day, plans for the day include a trip to the doctors, the child looks to have contracted tonsilitus, that should be fun.  I also have CD's to burn and post, I'm doing a secret CD club for a message board I'm on, hope the recipiant likes my CD I'm having trouble compling at thr moment, all the songs I think I like annoy me after 2 spins. Oh well best get it done hadn't I.  urlLink

      Well I do! We had a lovely day yesterday, when he came home from work that is. We walked to the magnet the weather was bloody glorious. On the way I asked him if he thought I was pretty (bad day, paranoid) and he turned around to me and said the sweetest thing ever, "To me you have a perfect face" awwww I love my Mr! He says the sweetest things when he wants something, hehe. That's all I wanted to say so, byeeeeeeeeeeee.

      Since we put the fence up its rained virtually non stop, we have 4 panels left to paint and haven't been able to cause if it hasn't been raining the fence has been too wet, not best pleased.  Anyway, I feel a lot better than I did yesterday, I've had a good nights sleep for once, and actually felt like getting out of bed when I got woken up, amazing. I've got to go out in the pouring rain today, need bits and have to go to the magnet (local shops) for it. Oh well is better than being in all day init.

      'S been a bit of a busy one. I'll start with Friday shall I? Well no baby spid that morning, mum had taken her to my cousin's house they went to bridlington Friday. So me and Mr.Spid got up late-ish and mooched around for a bit. Then we got dressed an went into town, where we went and ordered our fencing and new lawn mower, which I love, he he. We came home then and cleaned up and chilled out some more.  Saturday I got up early with Baby Spid as usual, about half nine a knock on the door came, fencing and new mower had arrived. So Mr.Spid was dragged out of bed and we spent the day erecting (oooh errrr) fencing and mowing the lawns with a decent mower, yay. We finally get that done and come in, have tea and put baby spid to bed. So I'm on a mission to get pissed then, which I did, at about twelve midnight I was sat watching TV and passed out for a few hours, apologies to anyone I was speaking to on msn at the time. I woke up at around 4am due to the heat and didn't sleep well then I tried to about an hour later.  I was awoken at 9.30 Sunday buy baby spid, I was knackered. So I had a lazy morning. Mr.Spid took baby spid to the garden centre to get paint for the new fence. I made the typical Sunday dinner, which was yummy. After dinner we painted the fence, I got more paint on me than the fence though. Still its cool, almost all painted now.  No big plans for the week ahead as yet, but watch this space, cabin fevers setting in now. Nighty night peeps  urlLink            urlLink

      For sale, about the size of an average 6 year old. Likes Chocolate and cheese (that's about it) DO NOT FEED AFTER MIDNIGHT. Can be used as a cute distraction in shoplifing offence's or as a deadly assin, she knows how to break necks and torture people. I swear she's only seen happy tree friends once, and I didn't realize how violent it was when she saw it! Contact me for pricing and postage and packing charges.  He he I not really selling her, she's lying in, its ace! She amazed me yesterday, we went to my mates to take some stuff over for them, the we is a collective me mr.spid and baby spid. So we got there about 7 and sat and had a cuppa as you do. Then we had another cuppa and a spilff, then another cuppa, well for some reason, we won't stay long ended up being ok we shall stay while 11 and then get a taxi home. After the lack of sleep baby spid had the night before you'd have thought she would have fallen asleep very early, but alas no. She was still trying to remove my head by jumping on it at 11 just before we got in the taxi to come home, fell asleep in the taxi though, which aint bad, and she's still asleep now, which is even better.  Hopefully going to a pub quiz tonight, make a few calls and we shall see.

So I'm sort of in a mood, the other half of me just wants to give myself a slap and then give the Mr one. I'm too tired to care right now, we shall see what transpires when he gets back from work won't we.

      Been on my own with crap rattling round my brain for the past few hours and have come up with some questions. See list below.    Why is it when you ask a man what his ultimate sexual fantasy is he always answers "Dunno, threesome"?  The chicken or the egg?  What was the first swear word and why was it considered bad?  Who decided a fuck was a fuck?  Why am I writing this list?  Should I keep my hair black and purple, or just dye the lot black, you know collars and cuffs stylee.  Why is there never porn on TV when you wanna watch it?  Why do I do stupid things, all the time?  Should I start writing rock-ish songs again?  Why did my guitar string break? Twat  Do I think too much about pointless stuff?  What shall I do with my website?  why is it nobody msn's you til your busy writing your blog?  Marriage, yea or neigh?  Am I a good listener, is my advice of any use?  Is the band ever gonna happen?  why am I trying to make this go to 20 when I cant be arsed?  no point is there?  and?  the only reason I am writing owt here is so it gets to 20. Ok?   beds calling me thinks  urlLink          urlLink
