        &nbsp; Well all of you out there know what the above picture is and what it is all about and if you dont listen up! Marijuana's Definitions:  [n] &nbsp; urlLink a   urlLink soft   urlLink drug   urlLink consisting   urlLink of   urlLink the   urlLink dried   urlLink leaves   urlLink of   urlLink the   urlLink hemp   urlLink plant ;  urlLink smoked   urlLink or   urlLink chewed   urlLink for   urlLink euphoric   urlLink effect   [n] &nbsp; urlLink a   urlLink strong - urlLink smelling   urlLink plant   urlLink from   urlLink whose   urlLink dried   urlLink leaves   urlLink a   urlLink number   urlLink of   urlLink euphoriant   urlLink and   urlLink hallucinogenic   urlLink drugs   urlLink are   urlLink prepared   &nbsp; Biological Definition: &nbsp; Cannabis sativa, a plant native to Asia. The term "hemp" may refer to the tall, coarse plant itself or to the coarse, tough fiber from the plant, which can be used to make rope, fabric, etc. The word is also used to refer to any narcotic drug derived from this plant, such as marijuana and/or hashish.  &nbsp; So now you know a little about the magical plant called Marijuana or Cannabis as it has been called fore thousands of years. I want to tell you what I think about the American Governments views on this harmless but very useful plant. ( urlLink http://www.a1b2c3.com/drugs/mj022.htm ) That site right there will tell you all the uses for Cannabis and the facts are there and the government still cant see it! What the hell is wrong with this government? &nbsp; I dont think that the American Government is as opened minded to their 'subject's as I call us. They say they will listen to what we have to say but they dont. Americans have been trying to tell the Us government for years that marijuana, grown legally, can help our country out. Cannabis can be used for a very economic-efficent fuel. Cannabis can be also used for stronger ropes, yes rope is made of hemp people if you didnt know that already. Cannabis can aslo be used medically for many things such as arthritis and other medical conditions.  &nbsp; People say Marijuana is a 'Gateway Drug'. Really what is a 'Gateway Drug'? Ill tell you something about myself and then others I know and Ill take down this 'Gateway Drug' myth sent out by our parents and government! I have done marijuana/cannabis/hemp in my day. I would still do it today if I could. I mean I loved it, I loved the high you felt the hours after it was amazing. Your so relaxed and mellow, the world seems to be a better place when you high and I love that feeling. I have been smoking marijuana since 1998 and I have only used speed once in that time. When I am high I dont get a fucking urge to do other drugs. I dont see a use to do other drugs at this point in my ife so I chose not to. Thats right you got a choice to do them or not to. Everyone has a choice to do other drugs, marijuana doesnt tell you to do it. Its not like it has voices which tells you to do them. If your a strong enough individual then you will not surcome to its so called power you know what I mean? Now for people I know some has surcome to the powers but yet its not like its an epidemic like the US government makes it sound like. Not everyone is doing it. Out of the people who smoke pot only about one-quarter do other drugs. So dont make it sound like a fucking epidemic because it is not! &nbsp; Here is somehting else for you idiots in the government to think about this is a quote from my mom as we were talking about marijuana the other night. She said "I would rather have my children smoke pot than do other drugs" thats right she said that. So why does these Pilgims caleld our governmetn have a big deal with it? Why is it illegal to make water pipes? i dont udnerstand that as water pipes can be used to smoke tobacco as well. If water piepes are illegal then I think so should be hukkas! I mean you can also smoke marijauana out of that too. &nbsp; Anyways what I want to say is the Kottonmouth Kings a hip-hop/rock group out of Cali is the voice of many people in the US these days. They speak what we think so we dont have to. They are all about Legalizing Freedom, freedom to smoke a plant which grows naturally. Why can I we bomb other countries and kill innocence and have that legal but it is illegal to smoke a plant. That still gets me. We kill people but cant smoke a natural plant. Hmmmm I dont get it. Our government is stuck in its pilgrim ways and the damn Catholics rule our country and that is wrong. LEGALIZE FREEDOM.

      You know many people go through life wondering why they were put on this earth, why they have been chosen to live a life of many prosperities when others die. Well in all honesty their is no question to that no answers at that. No one really knows why we are here or when our lives span will end but when it does do we leave the simple pleasure behind or does it continue in the afterlife. Is there an afterlife at that? Well I often wonder myself why I am here and why I am secluded in my own solitude from time to time.&nbsp; I am a man of many indescretions, many injustices in my mortality.&nbsp;I am neither perfert nor flawed. I am me and thats all I can really be. I am a man who has hurt people in his life. A man who has been hurt himself. I learned thus moving on with a clearer mind and respect for ones self. Am I wrong because I hurt or have hurt? Should I be ashamed for doing what I have done? Maybe I need to justify the wrongs done to me by others and others by me. Do I need say I am a man of convictions or mistruths and half-hearted lies. Must I say I lead a double life lying to those I love while lying to those I mislead? Should I feel sorry or mad at myself for this? What should I do? I need to be alone but yet my solitude makes me want to be with someone. But when I am with someone I want to be alone. What is the truth that lies in this? What can I make of this mishap in my own flawed world? I need happiness but I shun it for the fact I think I dont need it. I own my world right? So why cant I control it. I am lost, up shit creek without a paddle to guide me through the wicked forest of lost emotions, simple pleasures, torn souls. I am in love but is my love what I am in need of. Do I need more. So I need more? &nbsp; Imortality, those undead, those night walkers those perfect beings. Darkness is their confidement, Light is there solitude. Does this mean Imortality is a gift or a curse. Should I feel scared or enlightened? Should I care or just dont give a fuck? &nbsp; Simple Pleasures, Solitude in Confidment, Hatred of ones self, Disobedience in your own mind. Lost when your really not lost at all but scared. Questions that need answers.Answers that reall have no questions.

        &nbsp; Love, My Love what a beautiful woman she is.&nbsp; She is everything to me and I know I am to here. She makes my soul shake in excitement everything I hear her voice. And I tell you she has a sexy voice. Her name is Monica and she is from Cali. Yes a Cali girl! Perfect I must say in everyway. She completes me, she makes me want to be more, she makes me feel not alone anymore. Many people say online romances never work but I am here to prove you wrong. Monica and I are in love, we will be until the day we die, together or alone whichever way God intends us to die.  &nbsp; Perfection, a word not really used in todays society. But perfection can be used to discribe my soulmate. My wonderous woman, my vessel of love so to speak. She is perfect in more ways than you will ever know. She has the best voice, the smile that can cure polo (dont quote me on it), the body of an egyptian queen and the compassion and intelligence of no other. She knows what needs to be said and when to say it. She knows me even though she doesnt really know me and thus the reason I am here. I am here to show her who I am and what I want to become. I am here to show my love my past and the flaws I posses. I am here to show Monica the truth in the word 'Love' to show her the truth behind the meaning and the reason I tell her 'I Love Her' forever and ever. She is the truth behind many lies, she is the key to the doors without keys. May my skeletons show, may my flaws be healed, may my love for you Monica be forever true like a beacon of light in the sky. &nbsp; "Every soul has a light, Every soul has a reason to be. But not every soul has a source. For those who have that source there is truth behind its being. For every light there is a beacon. For every beacon there is hope. For every hope there is Love. For the Love there is Happiness."
