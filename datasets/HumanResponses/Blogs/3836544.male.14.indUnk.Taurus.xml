       hello to all my adoring fans out there!! im back from my grounded days!!!   well this post may be a little long, but no longer than any of my others.. so to make it easier on you and me i will divide it up into  sections. each section will contain contents of the day that it states at the beginning of the section....thats just for you brittany. to make it easier on my reader(i would put an "s" to that but the sad truth is that my following is still quite small...kinda like the manhood of that indestructable lego man....) on with the show!!!.........   friday:  i woke up at about noon-ish...which sucked because i realized i was going to the 2:40 showing of anchorman with steffan. (this is the start of my groundination).....anyway, i got up and laid still and watched tv for about 30 mins. then i remembered again that i was seeing anchorman. so i got chlothes and took a shower, then dressed. (as i normally do so ya know) about 20 mins after i got out steffan was here. so we were off to anchorman!!!! when we got there, there were considerably more people on this opening than in king arthur, no suprise there. of course this movie was much more anticipated.  so after the movie i called my dad to pick us up. he got uber mad and ill tell ya why. well, to see a movie you normally ask permission. wel no one was home and they wouldnt answer their cell phones so i just left a voice mil saying i ent to the movies with steffan. well i guess my dad didnt get that message. so h got uber mad. he went on this rave after steffan got out. thanks so much for not going off on me while steffan was there!! great kindness man. anyways he got uber mad and i got grounded. yay. well i got home and had to go to a softball game. so i sat through that, and it wasnt really that horrible. i didnt mind it at all really. it was kool. well it was in neosho and there were 2 of 'em. this one then another at 8:30 or somethin like that. my sisters team killed on each game!!! alright!!! it was kool. so we went home and because there was nothing else to do i slept...   saturday:  the usual only i had to wake up at 7. we had to paint a house. it was kool though, i got into a caulking war. we were shooting leftover caulking at eachother. i lost. and i got covered in paint and caulking. so yeah, those chlothes are forever ruined, oh well i dont care really. it was greatness though. plus we got pizza for lunch. that is always groovy. yep, pizza and pink lemonade. im just wondering, what makes pink lemonade different from regular lemonade, and for that matter, why not call the other lemonade yellow lemonade?? and i mean c'mon, what is PINK lemonade sposed to bring to the taste?? pink?? iuno, that may just be me. but its something to think about.  well that job finished around one and i was getting a buzz from painting with oil based paint. we went home and changed and headed off to neosho for the last gme of the tourney. they had one at 10 but we couldnt make it to it. well i saw the 2 game. we lost. yet won the tourney. it was kool. only down side other than the losing thing, my sis was sick. she threw up in center field. which was pretty punk if you ask me, if only she'd puked on the home plate, that wouldve been awesome. after that we came home and did nothing and thats the end of that day...   sunday:  ok so today we just kinda did nothing. went to church and then went to lunch. the sermon was great though. it was anti-gay all the way. and it brought up a good point. if you allow gays to marry this re-writes the marriage law. this could lead to several things. its not so much that gays are getting married, its that it opens a doorway to worse things. if this is passed what is to keep people from taking 2 wives? a cousin? a dog? in marriage. this really isnt a good thing indeed. plus ya kniow, people cant keep the marriage laws so just lower the standards right?? well what if we apply this to driving?? well you know, people cant keep driving laws so lets lower the standards... wrong idea. oh well if youd like to discuss this further just IM me....you know. well we went for lunch.  after luch jess had to go to practice so we wet to a movie. which is really kool, i mean i didnt have to pay or anything. well they went to see king arthur(id already seen it) so i went to harry potter. and it was pretty good really. im not a huge fan but i dont mind them. i like them, they arent unbearable. but yeah i saw that and liked it. dont judge me. but yeah.......went to pick up jess and headed home. and now here i sit, typing because i havent for a while. and yeah, thats the day for ya...  ok now time for your favorite part:  hip hop word of the day: fo shizzle  song of the day: danger woman -the aquabats  movie of the weekend: ANCHORMAN!!!!   SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!  well until next time remember...jack black punted the dog off the bridge!!!  sincerely, [harry_potter]

      ok, here goes, i took a break from blogging, yet again, only because there was and is basically nothing to type about... but im back with new material....so please, do read on, i know youre bored. ok well ill start with yesterday... &nbsp; on this day i did ntohing in the morning, or in the afternoon. i was online and i downloaded music from none other than thrice. great band, so check them out if you havent already. well i did that for about an hour and got bored so i watched tv. i got bored again and got on after dinner. turns out there is a concert at dioko. so i decide to go considering it was a hardcore concert. so i went over there and it was about 9-ish. and that was when it was scheduled to start, supposedly. well it got pushed back. and it wasnt till 10 that they started. the first band up was everwill. not a favourite of mine. the band in itself is great. a lot of talent in it. i just didnt like the singer. he didnt have that great a scream, nor did he uphold the tradition of hardcore. they arent hardcore. they're rap/metal at best. and i really dont like rap/metal. well they finally got off and it was "while i breathe" up next. they were great. the singer was great. and the band had a lot of talent. hardcore at its fiest indeed. well they left and it was "dark is the day". they never cease to amaze. there was a mosh and it was just kool to watch. i liked it at least. im too pansy to get in a mosh though. i mean i would under these curcumstances....1) i was about 7 inces taller. 2) if there werent people like kevin, or of kevins size in there. 3) if i had friends there with me.... well dark is the day got off and with them the majority of the crowd left. i think there was a total of 0 people left to watch "a show of hands". this band wouldve been better if they had 2 things. 1) a different lead singer, for many many reasons. 2) if the singer would annunciate. 3) if the pianist would play more....that concludes it. well needless to say the band didnt do too hot at this show. they guitarist was great. lots of talent sadly, he's being held back with this band. well once they quit i as on my way home. finally. i got in and went to bed. i do love me some sleep. &nbsp; today i did basically nothing. i mowed to lawn, and saw mean girls. which was kool. the chairs in that particular theatre made it a lot of fun. and those that went know what i mean, they are extremely spring loaded...hehehe. that was fun. well at mean girls i met up with steffan whitney and kendra. it was ok i gues. we al didnt really talk though. so that was a bit of a bummer i guess. and thats my day. when i got home i did the usual. a medley of computer and tv. how fun. well here i sit typing to ya now. and i think thats a bout it.......bye for now &nbsp; hip hop word of the day: (it has been used, but its so great)&nbsp;&nbsp; mo betta &nbsp; song of the day: under a killing moon -thrice &nbsp; movie of the day: mean girls  &nbsp; quoteable quote: gretchen is so hot......(this was used throughtout the whole time we were in the theatre of mean girls, used mainly by steffan) &nbsp; until next time my fans.....

        hello fans!!!! im back from my absence. now i know youre wondering, "what was it that andrew did that was so important that he didnt blog??" well wonder no longer. i am here to fill you in!!  &nbsp;  well lets start with yesterday...it was fun. one word can sum it up: dodgeball. lots and lots of dodgeball. well, i started the day by waking up and getting ready to go over to steffans for a "day of fun". well it kinda was. when i arrived it was about one. and only steffan was there. trey was set to come at 2 and didnt show up till like 2:45, the loser. nick came about 2 though, so it was kool. we watched this thing about a jesus christ action figure. that was hilarious. we had fun with that. when trey finally arrived we headed down to the field with dalton and we played our first round of dodgeball, and it sucked. it was so hot. i was soaked in sweat.  &nbsp;  we went in to rest and went bak out a bit later and brennan came with. we played some more and then whitney and beka showed up. but at that time it was about 5:47 and at 6 i had to go watch a softball game. it was good. jess's team obliterated the opponent. it was so great. 10-0 i was so proud.  &nbsp;  after the game i went back to steffans and they were still playing dodgeball. so i joined up. and from about 8 to complete dark we played. after that we went in and tried to think of something to do. so we resorted to the good old stand by, hide and seek. woo-hoo. i really hate that game most nites. but i played and at about 10 beka and whitney left. and from about 10 to 11 we did nothing. just sat there. i went home and slept.  &nbsp;  on to today. i did almost absolutely nothing today and im proud to say it. i got up and ate and sat around till about 4 when i had to go get my hair cut. when we got back from that we made dinner. omlettes to be exact. they were great. but after that i just kinda sat around until i was informed i was gonna go see anchorman. this, of course, was great news. i love that movie. its so kool. but yeah we did that and after it was over ian spotted blake aggus, now i dont have anything against him but i guess ian does. i was thinkin there was gonna be a fight. and ya know i wouldntve watched i wouldve joined. i was kinda hoping for one just because theyre fun. plus id like to see if we couldve taken them. 4 on 2....bring it on!!!  &nbsp;  well i got home from that and my dad gott on the comp so i slept till he got off and now here i am. well i think that wraps up my dys. until next time....  &nbsp;  hip hop word of the day: ghetto queen -translation- a person who raises kids in the ghetto  &nbsp;  song of the day: pretty in pink -the grown ups  &nbsp;  movie of the day: ANCHORMAN!!!! its super duper!!!  &nbsp;  quoteable quote: "can i wear your hat?"&nbsp;&nbsp; no, bitch -blake and ian  &nbsp;  until a later day.....  bye bye beautiful (to quote coheed and cambria)  &nbsp;  [beat_down_circle]

      man, today was kinda boring, well the first part was at least. it was the usual, wake up, sleep some more, wake up and take a shower. and then possibly eat something, it just kinda depends. today i didnt eat, i wasnt hungry. well at about 4:30 my dad shows up, he changes and we hit the road for springfield...  what awaited in springfield was a reunion of the People to People: Student Ambassabors with whom i went to austrlia with. it was realy fun. i got to hang out with keifer, my buddy. yeah, sadly the other 2 in the aptly named "fearsome foursome" didnt show up. we were very upset. in fact we are gonna mourn such a loss right now .......................................................................................................................................................................... ok enough with that. but the highlight wasnt AT the reunion, it was AFTER it. a few of us went to starbucks for some good coffee and stuff like that. it was me, agent v, chelsea, sarah and crutch. it was kool. i had some good iced coffee. i had a venti iced caramel mocha machiatto. pure deliciuosness. after that agent v ordered something she didnt like nd i was more than happy to drink that. it was good too, dont know what it was though. so needless to say, i was wound up. i mean bouncing and shaking wound up. it was great. plus the converstaion was kool. i think we have another reunion comin up in august. and then agent v may be having one in september or october. that would be groovy.  when we were all done chatting it up i headed home. we arrived at about 10. as soon as i got home i began downloading different things. the first was Trillian, and if you dont know what that is, just ask and ill tell mainly because i dont wanna type it on here. it is long and complicated. then i downloaded AIM, and after that, Yahoo Messenger. it was an....ummm....fun evening. well it was a good day indeed. got to see people i hadnt in a long time. had good coffee. it was great. and now here i sit telling my adoring fans about it. arent you so happy?? well thats it for today.  hip hop word of the day: bodunkadunk -translation- big butt  movie of the day: loser  quoteable quote: youre goin down like a sweet muffin -dodgeball  until i post again, bye bye beautiful...

      hellos again kids, im back from a 2 day thingy of not blogging, i know that at this point anyone who is used to reading this feels empty and utterly deprived, well im back for youre reading pleasure. please, try and contain your excitement.  well anyways the main reason ive been absent was because i went over to steffans. yeah, i went over there at like 4:32 yesterday and we just hung out till it was time to go see King Arthur. we explored sites and a lot of basically nothing. it was ok though. we played this one game with probably some of the greatest music you could ever hear. simply put, japanese techno, can it get better?!? anyways, we got tired of that and so we went on to a game called bubble. and who really cares right?? i dont need to tell you people everything...  so we left at around 6-ish to hit the 7:30 showing of King Arthur. Why did you leave so early?? you may be wondering quiety to yourself. well, there are 2 reasons. reason A) it was opening day and we needed to be there early for good seats. Reason 1) Brennan had to pick up these 2 girls, one he has a crush on and the other...well umm iuno. she was brennans crushes friend. iuno, i never put their names to memory, all i know is that they were pretty hot. oh yeah and ya know what i hate? people who spell hot with 2 "t's", what faggots. anyways, they were being fags and went to see white chicks. yeah, the wayans brothers are kool, but iuno, that movie just looks kinda dumb to me, i wouldnt know why....  well as we sat and waited in king arthur(it was about 1/2 and hour before it started) we began to realize that we were the only ones in the entire theatre. it was kinda bad considreing it was prime veiwing hours and still no one was there. so, because we told hannah we'd meet her there we set our stuff down to save our seats and went out to wait for her... about 5 minutes later she shows up and we got munchies and drinks. after that we went for the movie. still hardly anyone had shown up. it wasnt till like 15 minutes till the movie started that people showed up and even then , the theatre didnt have anyone on the level part of the seats, you know the ones. the ones that you pray not to get when you go to a movie opening day. the ones where by the end of the movie your neck hurts. yeah no one hd to endure that opening day pain, i was very upset.  when the movie let out hannah was stuck rideless. we mourned it i guess. but she got one and it was groovy. so we all headed home. well by we all i mean me steffan and brennan. and by home i mean steffans place of residence... shen we got "home" we decided to watch Killer Klowns from Outer Space. the slogan reading: "in space no one can eat ice cream" i think thats it....not too positive though. either way this movie was great!!! i mean the acting was second rate and the klowns were kool looking. i loved it!!! and im not even being sarcastic. from the over actors to the groovy clowns. this movie got a 5 out ot 5 in my book. so i suggest that if you havent seen it hit yourself in the head repeatedly. after you do this go to youre rental store and pick up killer klowns from outer space and watch it as soon as you get home. if you do not then....umm...iuno what will happen, but you will be forevermore deprived.  umm also that night we watched Swingers with Vince Vaughn. that movie is also great. although the words baby, and money. but not the way we use them today oh no...no its used in that weird 50's talkin way. good thing im a fan of the 50's otherwise that would make me very upset. either or, this movie is great. another good one. not as good as the klowns. but it does get a 4 of 5...also that night we listened to prince, elton john, and meatloaf. a weird combonation indeed. hey, dont judge me. prince is great. like michael jackson. plus hes a midget, and basically its hilarious to look at him.  now on to today. lets see what happened. well after going to bed at like 5 we slept till like 2. that was great. other than my back hurt really bad. anyways...yeah i lost my cell phone over there....it sucks because my mom is now gonna gut me in my sleep and that really sucks and im sad. with that aside i finally remembered my aquabats dvd, which is a double disc set of SERIOUS AWESOMENESS!!!! thats what the box says too... hehehe. it is good though, dont get me wrong. i love it. well upon leaving steffans i went to another sftball game which was inevitibly canceled. probably because of the rain and lightning. they shouldve called it off before everyone got there. but hey, what do i know?? plus i guess that in todays society my logical thinking isnt a great thing. when we finally got home i slept. i sat down(well rather laid down) and fell asleep. when i awoke it was time for dinner. so i ate, and watched whose line is it anyway and about halfway through i fell asleep. when i woke, it was time for family guy and futurama which i watched with open heart and open mind...as i always do. so i watched and the family guy that was on i never really much cared for, oh well though, its better than most stuff on tv today. after futurama a behind the music: guns n' roses was on so i watched. after that was one on motley crue, and i watched well part of it at least. and now, here i sit, banging away on this blasted computer..and i think thats it for this go around.  newly added word of today: mo betta.....look it up in the hip hoptionary or just laugh at its funnyness  movie of the day: Killer Klowns from Outer Space  song of the day: Purple Rain -Prince  and remember: when life gives you lemons, throw them back and ask for oranges  later days kids [insert_name_here]

      hello fans!! its doubtful that anyone is reading this except brit so heres to you..... anyways. today definately sucked. there were some high points but not too many. well the day started as usual, wake up, make eggs go to the trusty couch and most likely fall asleep yet again because of something i like to call lethargia. that always sucks but i dont mind its not like theres anything better to do in the summertime. so sleep as much as you wanna.  well when i was on msn(as i always am because summer is so boring) i was told to watch last comic standing. now this isnt too common for me to do i think i may have watched an episode earlier in the season but i did watch tonite. i saw mr. london get roasted and then came the battle. Ant v. Gary... my choice was ant i mean from what i saw he was hilarious. and tonite gary just sucked something aweful. i mean it too he really sucked nothing too hilarious. but ant, man o man ant was OUTRAGEOUS!!! i was rolling in laughter. he craked one about g. dubya and thats what lost him the battle. but really no one should care!! he was awesome doubletime to the max. oh well i think i kinda got over it. but still gary sucks!!!! if he wins i will be very upset. umm other than that i think the day was pretty boring.  song of the day: Float On -Modest Mouse  movie of the day: Shriek if you know what i did last friday the 13th (SEE IT SOON IF YOU HAVENT!!!)  and remember: you stay classy america     ANCHORMAN OPENS FRIDAY!!!!!!

      greetings earth people... back from a day of explosions and fire and spit back out into this uneventful, boring house and life..... lemme tell ya about yesterday....man o man it was groovy. i began my day, as usual....wait, youve already heard this. well then ill just get to the "good part" if you dare to call it that. well after i posted my last post i headed over to ians. when i arrived i set my stuff down inside and we played halo for about an hour. so when we finally went outside it was about 7-ish. which was kool i think. anyways, we began lighting different explosives, aa mix of bottle rockets, smoke bombs, fire crackers and dynamite. it was great fun.  while we were lighting firecrackers and throwing them at random things ew came up with the idea to tape 3 or 4 to a lego man and blow his already tiny manhood to nothingness. so we tried first at 2 black cats. he wasnt wounded at all. yhardly a singe mark anywhere. so we went for 6 (a big jump i know, but we didnt wanna see him in one piece again). still a vast amount of nothing. still no signs of woundage.so we jumped up to 10 firecrackers.... and yet again nothing. it seemed to be destiny that the lego man would not explode. so we hung our heads in shame and found pop cans to try to kill. and if i may say, those are extremely easier to blow up. put just about anything in there and youll blow a hole in its side.  well after all the firecrackers and smoke bombs and bottle rockets it was time for roman candle war. well i wanted to have one at least, but it didnt happen....so instead i went for the good old fashioned sparkler bomb....but yet again, there was a no. oh well. we set off and artillery shell and then fountains...ooh so great. (sarcasm intended).  so after the fireworks we headed in to watch the tick. good stuff right there. it was hilarious. and for those who dont know what the tick is, its an old show that they "man" took off the air. after that we watched army of darkness. yet again i will remind you that army of darkness and the evil dead series are some of the best of all time. WATCH THEM!!!!! about half way through "army" i fell asleep. it was all because of benadryl. see ian has cats and andrew has allergies associated with cats which is not a good mix. so i took benadryl and was out by midnite...  i woke up wheezing and coughing which was not how i wanted to start my day. so to try and help this i went outside and started blowing more things up (if nothing else it raised my spirits). i left from there at about 11-ish and headed home for a good nap. it felt great. i did nothing for the rest of the day, well at least until i get a call about seeing dodgeball again, which i happily accept. that movie rules!!! pepper brooks is rad.  well when that let out we went to best buy, which was closed...fuinally we ll headed hime and i got online but forgot to get on messenger....sorry everyone who was andrew deprived last nite, i did not intend for it to be that way. so now here i sit typing you this boring story about my 4th. well i think thats about it....  movie of the day: Army of Darkness(yesterdays), Dodgeball  song of the day: Poseur -Calibretto 13(yesterdays), Ballroom Blitz -Calibretto 13 edition  and remember: dont push the ladder....no no NOOOOOO!!!!!!!  later days extremely bored americans, [insert_name_here]

      hello reader... you have chosen to read my blog, so i thank you...anyways...its my first time to post so where should i start?? hmmmmmm....i know....ill start......right.....here!  well not too long ago i headed acros the sea and over to the country/continent called australia. that was such an awesome experience!! we snorkeled on the great barrier reef. i saw a lot of fish, some kool reef structures, almost drowned.....yeah, exciting day. also when i was over there i met some kangaroos. i met many kangaroos. one of which i named pierre. not exactly a very asutralian name, but who honestly cares?!?! well i think that was the hi-lite of the trip....well not really, but i'll ust say that because im running extremely low on sleep and im having trouble typing and there would be too much to say...i might get around to typing all of the adventure one day...just not this day.  man o man......4th of july is here!!! WOO-HOO!!!! the ultimate pyro holiday!! and im making napalm and lots of other things...just bcause im kool like that. anyways, other than blowing stuff up i cant say im doin too much. im not even too sure if me and friends are gonna blow stuff up together which is pretty bad considering today is the 4th and i still dunno what im doin. oh well i guess.   man, gettin back to joplin shows bme just how boring it really is. i went to see dodgeball 2 times in the 1st 2 days i got back. but thats ok because that movie is one of the best all summer. i think that steffan has gone to see it like 7 times now? not sure exactly i kinda quit trying to keep track of it all. but other than dodgeball i didnt really do much i did see spiderman 2, which was a lot better than i expected. im normally not too crazy about the movies that the critics rate as a "good" movie, only because of what they call "bad" movies. oh well this was kind of an exception to the rule. it was good. but i think that they need to kool it on the comic book based movies. there have been too many of them, and there are more on the way. although, x-men, which is a great comic book, i am really looking forward to. from what my informants say, gambit is in the next one. well im hopin, because gamit is the koolest ever. i mean, he throws flaming cards, you cant get much kooler than that. other good movies comin out, anchorman, alien vs. predator(predator will kick major alien anus), nd im sure there are more but im too tired to think of them all.  a movie to consider would be the evil dead series. they are really awesome. if you like anything having to do with zombies or gore or whatever you are missing out on one of the best movie series of all time. oh yeah, and if you happen to know of any good gory horror films, let me know. i like them, well most of them. so yeah, if youd just do that.  dioko is extremely boring when you o and there arent very many people there. and for those who dont know, dioko(not diokos) is a little coffee shop in joplin. its normally fun when a lot of people are there, otherwise it isnt that great. they have great coffee and smothies though. so if youre in the neighborhood go check it out sometime.  i wanna have a movie thing again soon. i havent had one in like over a month so its definately over due. so those that know what im talkin about we HAVE to schedule one soon.  VERY SOON . yes indeedy jim  well i think thats all i WANT to post in this one. i need sleep i have to get up in 3 hours. and that sucks. oh well, until next time, remember: Never Give Up, Never Surrender
