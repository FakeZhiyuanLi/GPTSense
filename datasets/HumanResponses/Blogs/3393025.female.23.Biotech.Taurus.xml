      So, PHISH just announced that they will not play any more shows after this summer.  I will always remember this day.  A lot of people are sad, but I don't really know how I feel.  I'm just happy that I got to see them before they left.  And, this is exactly what I needed to help me decide what to do this summer - go on phish tour, obviously.  This will be the last wandering, free-spirited summer.  or so she thought....  Any way, it's like almost 1:45am, I still have to do laundry, pack, go to jazzercise at 6:15am (hmmm...maybe not), get to work by 8:50am for a meeting>non-stop testing until noon, hopefully sooner.  then, i need to book it to the airport to make my 1:15pm flight to new york.  i can't wait to sleep on the plane.  only 12 more hours...

      I've always wanted to start one of these, but I never got around to it. Kind of like I never got around to studying for the GMATs, learning how to play the guitar, applying for the PeaceCorps, the list goes on and on. I wanted to name my blog "Perpetually Confused", but that was already taken, so "Perpetual Confusion" it is! I feel like this might help me clarify my thoughts so I can figure out what the hell I want to do with my life. I had a journal that I used to write in throughout high school and occasionally in college, and it really helped me understand myself better. However, understanding myself doesn't necessarily mean understanding which direction I am meant to go. Do I want to go my parents' route - go to business school, make tons of dough, and start a family? Do I want to temp for the rest of my life and take trips as I please? Do I want to go on tour and sell veggie burritos and hear great music? Do I want to be a bartender in tropical places around the world? The lattest (is that a word?) would be nice, but what if I get stuck somewhere? What if I suddenly turn 40 and realize that I am all alone in Timbuck2 with no money or way of getting in touch with anybody?   I told my little brother that he can never get married. He has to get really rich and take care of me for the rest of his long life. Zack is my favorite person in the world. He will always be there for me. So why not strive for Timbuck2dom? What is holding me back? I always thought that I was meant to do great things with my life. But is that how everyone feels? Does everyone try to sell products in the mirror when they are younger? "You simply must buy this Noxzema. Look how fresh and clean it makes my beautiful face." Am I crazy or is that normal?   I don't want to be famous or anything. I'd hate to have people like myself reading articles scrutinizing every last detail about my life. "Mary-Kate and Ashley party hard!" Well duh! "J. Lo is back together with Marc Antony." Why does everyone care so much? Why do I read this bullshit? I would die if that became my life. I would much rather be the reality TV-obsessed individual that I am than Paris Hilton. Wait a second... Perpetual Confusion.   But I WOULD love to be rich. Really, really rich! "Rich Girls" = best.show.ever.   And of course I want to be happy. Sex every morning would be nice too, but I guess I can deal with my vibrator since it's worked for the past...forever.   And I would like to make my own hours. I can handle 50+ hour work weeks as long as I can take every other week off. Or maybe every other month or even every other 2 months. 3 months is a stretch for me, but I could deal as long as I could have a long weekend or few in there somewhere.   So there we go - I wanna be rich, not work that much, travel excessively, and not be famous. Well, at least I'm not famous. And I guess I do travel kind of excessively, but I'm talking like, "hey, I feel like going to Thailand this weekend. The trip's on me - does anyone wanna come with?" That would be awesome.   I have also considered bankrobbing. But like the guitar and PeaceCorps application, that is just another idea that is collecting dust in the back of my head. And, when I brought the idea up to my mom, she started crying. I don't want my momma to cry. But it could be a lot of fun. I dig adrenaline rushes and I am very sneaky. I think I'd make a good bankrobber, too. I'll just keep undusting that idea every so often...   Any way, this blog has inspired me to reopen my motivation statement for the PeaceCorps. This, and I just talked to an old friend today who said she is leaving for the PeaceCorps next month in fucking JAMAICA!! Why am I wasting this precious thought-flowing time??   Until next time...(hopefully there will be a next time).

      So I have this problem.  I CANNOT say "No" to people.  I would much rather make fun, exciting plans with 5 different people on the same night than to say "Sorry, I'm already doing something that night."  It's like, I see someone coming up to me at work on Friday around 4pm and I think, "Great, they want to hang out with me tonight, and I already told blah I'd go to their house, and I told blah I'd go to the bar, and there's that show at the blah that I really want to go to..."  So they suggest some enticing plans for the evening or even something extremely lame that I would never even consider doing and what do I do?  "Sure, that sounds like fun."  What is my deal?  Thank the Dude that people are still friends with me.  My best friends always ask me a few times, "So, are you  REALLY  coming or are you gonna flake again?"  Any way, if you have any suggestions for this terminal condition of mine, please fire away.  I need some serious help.

      I didn't even  look  for the how-to-play-guitar video, nor did I dust off my guitar.  I suck.  Sigh.  But I did  think  about it - does that count?  Tonight, I am flying to Long Island to go to Jonathan's cousin's wedding.  I haven't seen Jonathan in almost 3 weeks and I am so excited.  This is the first time I have ever cared about someone so much and I cannot even sit still.  I even went SHOPPING (did I mention I  hate  shopping?) to find the perfect outfit for the wedding, but I ended up getting so flustered that I think I'm just going to bring every fancy thing in my closet and have Jonathan pick out what he wants me to wear.  Isn't that cute?  Let's see...Monday night, I hung out with Lynn and her boyfriend Max after tutoring.  We went to the Mission for some burritoes and then met up with Emily, Dan, and Adam for some drinks at this bar on the corner of Fillmore & Waller.  It was Adam's last night in San Francisco and I have no idea when I'll see him again.  But I'm sure it'll happen, ya know?  Wisco ain't that far...  Tuesday, I went out with Emily and Rachel at the BBC.  We played some Photohunt.  Rachel said that she and Kelly had made fun of all the people playing Photohunt down in LA the weekend before, but I could tell she really dug it by the end of our session.  RustyAmandd is still in the top 10 high scores from last October.  Woohoo!  Russ is definitely the master Photohunter.  Wednesday I didn't do anything after shopping aside from watching Law & Order and then some Simple Life action with the fam.   Last night, I went to PF Chang's with Rachel, and then we went back to her house.  Her mom gave me a dress to wear to the wedding (Jonathan will be the judge of that), and then we headed to Chadwick's for some wine and....  Yeah, so then we went over to Celeste's for another session.  That was fun.   And now I'm here at work, watching the clock tick down.  Ah, fuck it, I'm  outta heeeeere.  God I miss the State.  Until next time, my dear-electronic-journal-which-everyone-in-the-world-can-read.  :)

      Ozric, a seemingly meaningless word that gives a hint of utopia, paired with a feature that you wouldn't necessarily want near you, unless they are fried up and served as calamari.&nbsp; I myself despise that shit, but I really dig the band.&nbsp; I hadn't heard of them until a couple months ago when I decided to go to the All Good Music Festival.&nbsp; Some people on Phantasy Tour were raving about them and I&nbsp;assumed they must be good if they were given one of the two covetted late-night slots at the fest.&nbsp; They evidently founded "space rock" back in the early-to-mid-1980s in Britain.&nbsp; And their keyboardist is Roger Waters' son, so I figured that they at least&nbsp;had to have some inherited talent.&nbsp;   Any way, I caught the first part of their late-night set at the festival, and they were pretty good.&nbsp; Kind of a combination of metal, trance, .....space rock.&nbsp; Yeah, that pretty much sums them up.&nbsp; Their setup is a drummer, guitarist, bassist, synthesized keyboardist (aka Waters, Jr.), and this crazy flutist who ended up flailing his arms around and acting like a monkey more than he actually fluted (if that's a word).&nbsp; I wanted to watch a bit longer, but Jonathan was tired and we had to rest up for our precious Disco Biscuits' late-night on the following evening, so we cut out early.  Luckily enough, the Ozric Tentacles played at the Fillmore on Friday night, so they saved me from making the trek down to Santa Cruz to see Sound Tribe (which I would have been obliged to do since I simply must hit any show that comes my way), and I got the chance to see a full, intimate show.&nbsp; And this time, I had a lot more energy post-pad thai across the street.&nbsp; I thought the show would start at 8 for some insane reason, but the dude at the door told me it wouldn't start until 10, so I wandered around the neighborhood for a good half hour trying to find the ultimate place to eat dinner by myself, and ended up directly across from the Fillmore at this cheap thai place.&nbsp; Then I decided to move my car a bit closer to the venue so as to avoid the crackheads in the area after the show.  So, back to the band.&nbsp; They were awesome.&nbsp; The flutist was again pretty distracting, but when I squinted my eyes a bit, the tentacle-filled light show blurred him out and I was able to really focus on each instrument.&nbsp; I always seem to follow a band's bassist more so than any other artist.&nbsp; I really need to learn how to play that shit.&nbsp; Maybe tomorrow.&nbsp; No, I'm hanging out with Lynn tomorrow.&nbsp; But maybe, HOPEFULLY, I will set aside an hour or two of my Tuesday evening and finally dust off that guitar in the piano room, find where I put that "how to play the guitar" video, and learn how to jam.&nbsp; It's a plan, folks.&nbsp; The next post will be about my guitar-playing experience.&nbsp; Good night.&nbsp; :o)

      No, I don't mean the actual cheese that you eat (though I do really dig brie -&nbsp;yummy!).&nbsp; I mean the band, the String Cheese Incident.&nbsp; I saw them last night and the night before at the Warfield Theater in San Francisco.&nbsp; I haven't seen them since last December, and I had almost forgotten my love for them - blasphemy!&nbsp; Cheese was one of the first jambands I saw that got me into the whole music scene.&nbsp; I realized that yesterday was the 4th anniversary of the first time I saw them.  7/21/00 - The Greek Theater in Berkeley, CA.&nbsp; One of my best high school friends named Alyse was like, "I'm only in town for a couple weeks.&nbsp; You gotta see this band with me."&nbsp; Alyse had gone to my high school for two years, and then left her junior year (my senior year) to go to some boarding school in Connecticut.&nbsp; She was the over-achiever in our slacker group of friends, so I expected her to get even more hardcore at this new boarding school of hers.&nbsp; However, when I saw her for the first time after she started this school of hers, her hair was all nappy and she said she had been smoking even more pot than we did (if that was possible) and had become a total Choate slacker.&nbsp; I didn't believe her for one minute but was still intrigued.  One of the many reasons I was so excited to go to college on the east coast was because I knew Alyse would be in the area (what an ignorant west-coaster I was).&nbsp; Any how, on her visits to Philly, Alyse would make me go to various concerts with her like Phish or Primus.&nbsp; I respected her taste in music and decided to plunge into this string cheese idea of hers as I twisted my ratted up blond-streaks (yep, they were forming).&nbsp; I had heard the name of the band before and remembered that they played in Philly on Halloween '99, but the girl on my frisbee team who invited me kind of scared me.&nbsp; Oh well, better late than never.&nbsp;   By the end of that year, I decided to make the 10-hour trek up to Portland for their 3-night New Years' Eve run with Alyse and her new Santa Cruz friends.&nbsp; Yes, by this time, Alyse was already well into her first year at UC Santa Cruz, had defined dreads, and was what some considered a full-blown hippie.&nbsp; I too had taken the dread plunge and looked forward to the beginning of my new musical era.&nbsp; May the music never stop.

      Sorry it has been so long since I last posted, but I have a good reason - I just returned from my almost-month-long road trip.&nbsp; It started in Brooklyn on 6/17, Phish's first show of their "last tour ever".&nbsp; Just me and my new boyfriend Jonathan who lives on the other side of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;We ended up seeing all 8 shows (2 in Brooklyn, 2 at SPAC, 2 at Deer Creek, IN, and 2 at Alpine Valley, WI).&nbsp; I also got to visit my dear old grandmother in Louisville, KY.&nbsp; Then, Jonathan and I headed west.&nbsp; I got to visit some new states, check out Yellowstone, eat a shitton of fast food (Jonathan LOVES McDonald's).&nbsp; We saw the Dead in Utah and then headed to CA for the High Sierra Music Festival.&nbsp; The highlights of that were the Russo/Benevento Duo, staying up for 2 days straight, and meeting all the Arcata crackheads.&nbsp; Then, we zoomed back across the country for the All Good Music Festival in Masontown, WV.&nbsp; After our over-heated lack of sleep at HSMF, we decided to spend this festival in an air-conditioned Ramada Inn.&nbsp; Worst.roomservice.ever.&nbsp; But hey, we slept well and had a damn good time.&nbsp; &nbsp; I thought I would get more into detail on this crazy trip 'o mine, but it wore me out.&nbsp; I am now at work and deathly ill, though I am a lot better than I was 2 days ago.&nbsp; I'm also kind of post-tour depressed and might get into a pretty negative rant.&nbsp; So, I will end this now and write more later.&nbsp; Time to raid the first-aid kit for more nasal decongestants...
