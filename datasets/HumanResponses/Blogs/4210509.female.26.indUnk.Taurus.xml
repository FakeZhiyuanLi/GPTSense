       hello ya'll... i am new to this whole computer thing so bare with me please. i would just like to tell my story to people that don't know me. i would like your opinion if you are willing to share. well here it goes. on a dark and stormy night... no just playing. anyway... i have benn seeing this guy since May and when we first got toghether we both agreed on only being friends with "benifits" if you catch my drift.cough cough. everything has been fine and still no attatchments BUT i just realized this past week that i DO care for this guy alot. he just recently went to Florida on vacation with his family. before today i hadnt talked to him since last Tues. well hurricane Charlie sweep there on Wed. or Thurs. and he didnt call me before he went on the cruise so i freaked out big time. i could not stop thinkin about him. now i realize that i do have feelings for him. he finally called me today and i was so relieved. i had a big cheesy smile on my face for hours. i don't know what to do. what do you think?  hillbillie
