      Just got back from St. Louis (Class Trip '04) was pretty cool. Saw harry Potter 3 over there and then we all went into a Cardinals store and yelled "Cardinals SUCK Cubs RULE!". Everybody just looked at us and we walked out. i took 116 pictures it's crzy 5 rolls of film (ha-ha hannah i got some picts of you). back to my main request help me find a digital camera so i don't have to spend money developing 116 pictures. Other trip oriented things: New Salem Village, Lincoln's Home, Capitol Building, Holiday Inn (pretty crap arcade, cool volley ball court), city museum, Science Center, crappy restaurants, The Arch, Home owned by a woman named Sara Dana built by Mr. Wright, "The old courthouse", Union Station. i think that's it but i'll change it later if i think of anything. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LMAO J's tooth brush holder=black colored item that is shaped as a rod with ridges 7" long LMFAO Sean M's tooth brush=electronic tooth brushshaped to a rounded point *cough* vibrator *HaC* i'll try and post some pictures in a couple days. So anyways i'm not doing anything much any more. ok so i think i think that's it for today.

      On friday the 28th i went to Wisconsin with some friends (Sean M, Alex A, David A, Gabriel A). It was teh bitching and teh rocking. it was crzy fun, and we made a lot of jokes like when we tried to get gabe to shoot orange juice out of gabe's nose, and he was eating chicken so i said he was gonna shoot some "mangled chicken" out of his nose. Then Sean M said that he would pay to see "Mangly the Mangled Chicken" ( a cartoon scenario where Mangly is shoved in to a wood chipper and is mangled. Then we got to talking about a headlesss chicken which you can find at www.miketheheadlesschicken.org . it's pretty creepy. We dug holes too big ass holes, so anyways i'm back now and trying to find a kick ass digi cam for cheap. oh and Sean m has two laser guns (Red, and Lefty) he had another (Zappy) except he dropped it into a puddle and it ESPLODED!!

      I think ppl assume that asians are good at DDR but the truth is ur only good if u have good "foot-eye" coordination. For instance, someone not to name any names, might have though he/she was good at DDR, then that someone might have played not to name any names and then lost horrible. Then a another duo went onto the dance thingy and totally kicked someones asses to kingdom come...remember i'm not naming any names, But they were only good because they practiced. bastards...and of course never embarasse ur self when playing DDR...it's too late for me. and of course  Dun Play Dee Dee Arr if ou sock

      Can-adi-a was a blast! I think it was...it was kinda boring so i'm going to do a "Captains log" from Day 1.  Captains Log 7/1/04 The crew awoke early that morning and loaded the starship to travel the 5 hour journey to "Port Huron"(right on the canada/america border.) we were stuck in traffic so the that drive took 8 fucking hours...that was so fucking long...i started threatening to gut every one on the street... The hotel was pretty much crap, except for the small pool...what a crappy pool...i did a couple laps and came out.  7/2/o4 We set out again arriving at the bridge where we would have to cross the line into "enemy territory". My Grandparents wanted pictures of the bridge in the background so we stayed and i noticed that all the squirrels there have black fur. They were like the Evil squirrels from hell...their eyes were RED (FULL OF 4N7I-L337 3V1L!!)Then there was this fat guy in a scuba suit walking the side walk near the water, and we walked over to him, he got on the other side of the rail, smiled at us, and splash. Then we crossed the bridge and entered canada where there were these french fry stands that sold french fries and they were really good, especially with the curry powder on them. We got to the hotel in "mississaugwa", Toronto and left our bags there and then went to downtown Toronto. On the way there i saw 5 "The Beer Store"'s and 6 "L.C.B.O."'s(they sell wine) Then we went to the Asian district and it was pretty cool, lots of street vendors, and hobos asian hobos. We went to a restaurant and then went sight seeing. We saw the Ceann tower of something...then we tried to get back on the expressway and came across a lot and i mean a lot of porno theatres and strip clubs...then there was this guy who said um some vulger things to another woman...there was a lot of "F*** yoo" and then a lot of "You i31tch", and then "Yeah that's right F*** Y00, i31tch!"  7/3/04 We went to Niagra Falls it was kinda not great... i mean it's water falling...but then we bought this sugar stuffed and i was insane for the rest of the day...it was so sweet! Then we went to a suburban super china mall! it had like 500+ stores inside of it!Lots of azn chixXors ^-^. so well that's how the day ended after i walked around the mall for like two hours with no money and lots of stuff i wanted to buy.  7/4/04 We went home...sweet home land on american soil!

      Ok gabe cuz u want the "411", it was pretty cool. The dj was crap thoughi swear if the guy ever heard irfan or even J us the damn machine they would fire that guys ass so fast! so it was like the ball room of a bar and there was this "play ground" in the back that caused pain to every one who touched it's metally/tire like surface! Ok so we didn't really dance, so i started to do the 1 break dance move that i know so it was pretty messed up, and then allison was apoligizing but she shouldn't have, it was the DJ's fault!! so allison was wearing a pink top and a black mini skirt it was awesome! so that's the "411"

      So we were at the hip (alex sean stefan and i) and we were going to alex's house and i did a "Ghost rider" (bike trick where u jump off and the bike just keeps going without you) so i jumped off and the bike kept going for like 30-40ft. which was freaking awesome, but while jumping off i lost my balance and fell bracing my fall with my right hand and using my left side to take the hit (OUCH).

      ...i'm too bored and only some shit is happening, and i need money...so alex's party was pretty cool(i got 2nd and 3rd, and then was getting better at D.D.R.) then we(barbara, hannah, sean m, alex, sam, josh, marcus, and danny) went to the new target at the hip, and sean we cracking jokes about returning womans underwear. "Yes, i'd like to return these, they were uncomfortable snug." was his exact quote. then we wandered across the street to borders and hannah left our diabolical swarm. we milled around for a while and marcus disappeared when we tried to leave so we had to spread out and search the premises. We found him and then we started to mock childrens books and he disappeared again! (Freaking Ninja Skills). SO then we went to the DUnkin donuts and started sucking the jelly out of donuts with straws (man that hurts) then we went to johns house and josh pissed barbara off so she chased him around and hit a cars hood and set the car alarm off (we dispersed). Then we regrouped and josh and sean climbed a tree infront of john's house and his mom was all "RAWR!!!" then it was like 7 so we decided to wander the dark streets and go to barbara's grandma's house then to her house where the crusade ended.

      So my older brother is gone for 6 outstanding days! My life is full of vigor, must do something out standing. (Pulls out little streamer shooter thing) *BANG* ok now to tell u my day. So i went to sleep at 5 am that was really  smart,  so i woke up at 12 which is like 7 hours so i figured i was good to go then i stood up and had a pounding headache. Imagine another heart three times larger than normal beating in your head. Then i ate something and went through general hygenic procedures, then played a game for 3 hours i'm lvl 19 now. Then i went to Mitsuwa (Japeneese mall that kicks ass) then my mom dragged me to ikea...that place is horrible...ands now i'm typing this and picking at my scab.
