      Today I am feeling good. And it is unusual. Everyone has their bad days right? Well I am having one of those good ones.  I don't feel the weight of the world on my shoulders today. I don't feel like hiding under the covers today. I feel like going for a nice walk.  Now underneath this inexplicable feeling of peace and hope is a curiousity of Why? What did I do (or not do) to feel this way? Was it something I ate? Did I do something to somehow flood my brain with endorphins?  I think I will just enjoy it while it lasts. I don't want to give you the impression that anyone ever notices my dark moods. When I am around people I can actually force myself into a sunny mood most of the time.  I did a bit of praying yesterday. I have been noticing some things that tend to help me have more good days. Praying daily seems to help. Exercise seems to help.  One thing I am realizing is that being self absorbed is very unhealthy. And I think as a society we are all way too self absorbed. If you think about it isn't being self absorbed just another way of focusing on what we don't have and how to get it? Or a session of self pity for the things we will never get?  Now I am sitting here in my dark room writing a blog instead of going out on that walk...

      So I'm not sure if the rest of the country is aware of this but we are all supposed to have a 'Go' bag packed and ready to go, in case of disaster.   urlLink http://www.nyc.gov/html/oem/html/readynewyork/prep_gobag.html   Nothing like packing a go bag to brighten your day eh? They have all these seemingly logical items you should pack, like water, batteries etc.  I guess 'disaster' is a polite way of saying "Oh shit! al-Quaeda(sic) did somethin' stupid again". Where we are supposed to go and how is unclear. I guess they will send a bus to pick us up and put us all up at the Trump Casino in Atlantic City or something.  As any New Yorker would tell you, within 10 minutes of any kind of announcement the entire city would be in state of gridlock. The entire city is in various stages of gridlock daily without a disaster happening for God's sake!  I am sure there are dozens of guys in think tanks trying to figure out where these retards are planning to strike next. I have a couple of theories on how to catch these turds before they do any more damage.    1) Set up a terror attack staging area.   Maybe if we set up this place where these dudes can blow themselves up without hurting others that would help. Personally you can set it up anywhere between NY and LA AFAIC. Maybe put it in the desert, that would make everyone happy. Set up a TV network to monitor the area 24/7 so we can watch these Nimrods blow themselves to smithereens during halftime or whatever. Hey, maybe they can even coordinate some sort of spectacular halftime show, blow themselves up in a domino fashion or something! They might even consult Paula Abdul on some dance moves...   2) Sting operation:   Here's a way to get rid of some of the really dopey ones (i.e. shoe-icide bomber Richard Reid). Set up a (fake) public speaking engagement for Osama bin Laden. Just make sure there is a warning included in the announcement in coded form (pig Latin, ubby-dubby or something) that it is a sting operation, so our own cerebrally challenged don't show up my accident. Maybe a good place to do this would be New Jersey in Secaucus or Newark.   Once all these guys are locked in the arena we could do all sorts of stuff to them. One might be tempted to simply nuke the arena. That would be too easy. I say we put on a show for them so horrible, so inconceivably painful that they just start to chew thru their wrists to escape the agony of the experience.  Start off with playing all the 'Cop Rock" episodes on the Jumbotrons. Next a four hour concert by world famous singer  urlLink "Wing"   If they make it thru that it's time to bring in Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Richard Simmons to Dance to the oldies..  Anyone left alive after that will be subject to idea #3:   Idea #3:   New York and indeed the whole world has plenty of exercise machines. All the work done to operate these machines is currently wasted. Why not connect up some generators and rechargable batteries to all of them and network all that lost energy potential? So when you do that 30 minutes on the Stairmaster, not only are you shedding unwanted pounds but are storing electrical energy to be used to fry these terrorists!

      I think we are all born with certain tools for living, and some of us are lacking essentials. Like a sense of other's feelings. Society is so wrapped up in themselves and their needs and pleasures that they can't see past their own noses.  Some people can't sleep at night. My mom used to say that was because they had something on their concience keeping them awake. I wonder how much truth is in that?  When my mind wanders in the twilight time before I sleep I seem to relive all my past mistakes. I have to 'change the subject' in my mind. Why do I keep reliving my past mistakes?  And why do we place so much importance on other people's looks? I am guilty of it, we all are to a certain extent. We all get old. Our bodies wrinkle and stretch and generally wear out. Men are more visually driven they say. Is it really what we decide is beautiful that drives this concept of beauty? Or how we want others to percieve the beauty of our significant others, or ourselves for that matter.  I just had a strange thought. What if we could choose between a mate that looked gorgeous to others but ugly to us, Or a mate that looked beautiful to us and ugly to others. Which would you pick?  As far as mates go I think my ability to please and satisfy her should be most important. It seems that many women are not satisfied with status quo. They always need a relationship to be progressing on some level. I'm not talking about marriage. I mean being married to a loving husband, having a good job, maybe a kid or two. They look for the next thing. Women always seem to need a goal. Maybe a bigger house? Maybe do the dishes a few more times a week? I think we all need to learn to aprreciate what we have and not look at what other's may have.  Women, If you have a man that loves you, takes care of you, is faithful to you and  doesn't beat you, you are better off than 90% of the other women out there. And the sooner you realize it the better. If your man possesses all these qualities I want you to go out and buy HIM flowers today.

      I don't know if there will be a part two, I am just covering my bases. :)   Jackie Onassis:   I met Jackie when I was 13 or so. I used to walk her dogs. She had an irish setter (I think it was) which was given to President Kennedy by the people of Ireland This dog was very old at the time. She also had what I think was a maltese. I was introduced to Mrs. Onassis and she was very nice as you would expect. Mrs. Onassis didn't spend much time shooting the breeze with me, so no real dirt I can dish. My dad on the other hand swears she would curse like a sailor when she got mad.  I also became somewhat friendly with the secret service guys that were protecting the kids. They had an office in the building where she (and I) lived. In those days the elevators had an operator. When any of the family came on the elevator a special button was pressed to alert the secret service. There were a few incidents where 'John-John' would duck his secret service by using the service elevator. On one particular day he did this and was mugged of his bicycle in Central Park. It was in the papers. Which reminds me. I was given one of John-Johns old bikes by Mrs. Onassis. I loved it! It had shock absorbers which made the ride nice and smooth. I had never seen a bicycle with shock absorbers before. There is a picture that exists of John-John and Mrs. O where he is riding this bike. How cool!   Billy Joel   Yes, I briefly met my idol! Back in the mid '80's I was a recording engineer. I went for an interview at a recording studio on 42nd street (Chelsea? Clinton or something) Billy was there working on an album called "The Bridge" Unfortunately I couldn't sum up the courage to have a conversation. I just said hello and sort of basked in the moment. I have seen him on a few other occasions and I saw the hint of recognition when he saw me. Billy is my piano mentor, albeit from afar. His playing totally turned me on to rock and roll piano. I hope to meet you again and chat sometime Billy. :)  I also met the following people during my recording studio days: Debby Harry, Bill Cosby, Roberta Flack, James Ingram, Grover Washington Jr., The original SNL band and many others who's names currently escape me.

      The 'Blog' phenominon (sic?)is rather new. I know it is supposed to be about current events (I guess it is), but I am writing about my past for now. I would like to use this to collect thoughts on my past and on who I am. I thing it is good psychotherapy to actually write out who I am.   I think on some level I imagine a beautiful princess will read this and be intrigued by me and fall hopelessly in love. Or maybe when I get to know someone I can direct them here to 'out' myself. Who knows?  I like to think of myself as a very kind and loving person, don't we all? But I know I can be a real ass at times as well. :p  It will probably take 100 posts for anyone to even begin to 'get' me., But I have to start somewhere!  The question I seem to be asking myself at the moment is "Am I a simple guy, or a complicated guy?" I think it best you decide this for yourself.  I think if I were to attempt to sum up my feelings on myself I would say I like me, but there is room for improvement.

      This is a tough one in a way. Trying to take a hard look at yourself can be painful. And the ego will kick in and make some excuses for sure. So this is who I am (in my own perception) at this moment.  I promise you that I can me quite funny and light hearted, but it seems the shit is rising to the top first in my blogging experience. This is feeling very theraputic for me releasing all this sad stuff. I hope someone gets off on it on some level. I should mention I have a few glasses of wine in me as I write this. I will try to be as balanced as possible.  I think I am a nice person. I really like to listen to people, I am not one of those that nods their heads waiting for you to stop talking so I can say something else, totally ignoring what you've just spoken. I am a listener, you have my ear if you are making any kind of sense or have a point. As long as you aren't babbling.  I think I am fairly intelligent. I am not as smart as I think I am though. I say this because on some things I can be so perceptive yet on others I haven't got a clue. For instance I am extremely sarcastic, yet a lot of other people's sarcasm flies right over my head.  I love my parents. There, I've said it. Just like any parent/sibling relationship I have my gripes, but overall they have been supportive and loving thruout my life. God bless you.  At this point you may have noticed I haven't gone on about degrees I hold, or how much money I make. I have not been steadily employed since 2000. But that is not why I don't brag. I don't brag because I don't define myself by my work. I didn't when I was making 50K a year and I don't now.  I am chronically curious. This goes hand in hand with the listening aspect. Even when I have absolutely decided on something, I will ask someone's opinion. Quite often their opinion will either reinforce mine in a totally new way, or challenge it in a way I never expected. I have opinions. But if my opinions are enlightened by someone else, I don't have the slightest problem with changing them. I see this as a great strength.  Some people ask why. I say why not. Is the glass half full or half empty? I am more concerned with exactly how much is in the glass.

      I mentioned a few of my good points in my last blog, so before anyone complains I will try to actually take a hard look at my bad points.  I am self absorbed. I guess admitting to being being self absorbed is kinda redundant seeing as I am bothering to write this stuff in a blog for the world to see but there it is...  I am lazy. If I had my say I would sleep 23 hours a day. My dreams seemed to have shattered My way of escaping reality is Zzzzz. Legal and free. The other hour I would be surrounded by people hanging on my every word and worshipping me.  I am judgemental. I tend to judge people on the way they talk and the company they keep. Is that wrong?  I am a megalomanic. I think on some level I am not better than anyone else, but uniquely gifted.   I feel shortchanged. I live in a world where people are starving, beaten, and homeless, yet I feel shortchanged for not having a wife that looks like Jennifer Aniston and living on the beach in Malibu.  I don't think of other's feelings like I should. I need to work on exercising the golden rule in my life.  I'm sure there is more, that's all for now.

      I suppose I should dedicate this to all the women that have broken my heart.  From my earliest days of puberty I have been rejected by the women/girls I have truely loved. I know that sounds 'oh poor me' but that is how I see it.  I should start off by saying I was very naive (and still am to a certain degree) when it comes to relating to women. I somehow got it into my head when I was young that I was unattractive to the opposite sex and was very withdrawn and shy. Upon reflection I realize this was not true at all. It probably is true now because I have not taken care of myself and am 280 pounds of blubber. Yet I still have a cute face.   To all you women that say all men want is sex, I want to tell you it is not true. For a time I wanted and pursued meaningless sex that made me feel empty inside. I only pursued it because the women I loved and respected rejected me. I got some satisfaction from it emotionally on the conquering aspect of it. "I talked a women into taking off her clothes and spreading her legs whoo hoo!"  I crossed a line in my mind that I wouldn't only have sex with someone I loved, that I would have sex for it's own sake.  The night Jennifer told me she wanted to be 'just friends' I called this woman around the block that had been pursuing me and released all my pent up sexual frustration on her.  The sad thing is this other woman really loved me, and I just used her as a sperm receptacle. Sperm that was meant for Jennifer, the one I loved with every fiber of my being.  Jennifer, when I professed my love for her, told me it was impossible to love someone you haven't slept with.   Not to say Jennifer was my first love, she was only the icing on the cake. My experience with Jennifer was what drove me to meaningless sexual relationships.  I think my first love was Laura. I was 13 or so. When you are so young the slightest sideways glance can crush your heart. I somehow from the deepest reserves of my being summoned up the courage to ask her to skate with me at the roller rink.  Me: Would you like to skate with me? Laura (goddess): no.  That single word so casually spoken crushed months of longing and admiration and masturbation dedicated to her. That single word was spoken by her as if I had asked to take a shit on her forehead.  Anyway I have actually loved very few women and the ones I did rejected me. I would like to take this moment to apologise to all the women I used for sex. It seems a few of the ones I didn't love really did love me.

      Yes, I say follower of Christ instead of Christian or 'born again'. Unfortunately there are many who claim to be Christians but aren't walking the walk, or a least trying to. Some have gone wayward on this path. Some just say they are on it, but aren't.  It is easy actually to tell if you are on the right path, we have a guidebook. When we do something wrong against God it is called sin. If you are doing something that the book says is a no-no, you are sinning, it's that simple  If this seems strange in the context of my previous discussions of loveless sex and other things I have done it is easily explainable.  Before my decision to follow Christ I did things that were clearly against the teachings of Christ. The difference is that I now do not do those things, and if I slip up and do them I ask for forgiveness. You can't fool God. He goes by your heart. He knows your thoughts. If you have done something wrong against God and are sorry for it, all you need to do is ask Him to forgive you and He will!  I think the thing that turns off many non-Christians is the concept that they will be held accountable for their actions. NOBODY LIKES TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO! Even if it's in their best interests.  Another thing I think turns off non-Christians is the belief that Christians think they are better or more pious than non-Christians. The true follower of Christ thinks he is better than no one.  I can best demonstrate my thoughts on this with an analogy. Let's say we are all in an AA meeting. Some of us are recovering alcoholics, some of us are thinking we may have a problem and still others are in denial that they have a problem. The true Christian is like the recovering alcoholic in as much as he realizes he has a problem, and he is trying to live a sin-free (alcohol free) life. Just as the alcoholic is never 'cured' of wanting a drink, the Christian is never cured of his desire to sin.   Sorry if I got a little 'preachy' there. I just wanted to clearly present a few of my thoughts on Christianity.

      In my family, the truth was always carefully hidden. Not overtly snobbish, but a subtle snide remark or a glance that was a little too long betrays the superior attitude that lies beneath.  My brother is a drug addict.  I don't mean he smokes a little pot, I mean he sticks needles into his arm, steals anything from anyone etc. He was homeless for a time. He is now in prison for the second time (that I know of).  My brother's 'condition' is a family secret. I have never seen my dad cry until the last few years.  At this point the story can take several paths. I can tell you some horrible stories, tell you how we are dealing (or not dealing) with this family crisis etc. I think I will tell you how my brother got on this path.  To me there is a line that we cross in our mind when we make a decision to do something. Also I believe we are born with tendencies to certain types of behavior.  A thought crosses our mind, and we either act on it or don't. Sometimes these thoughts can be rather bizzare, at least to some people.  One day my brother somehow got it into his mind to smoke pot. Now I know there are plenty of people that 'cross that line' and never go any farther. My brother crossed the line into drug use. Once there he continued to cross lines, but I think the biggest leap was into drugs or altering his reality. I believe once you have decided that altering your reality using chemicals is OK jumping to a different chemical is a small step.  That is why I believe that pot is a gateway drug. To phrase it differently, how many of you have gone from being totally straight to say smoking crack or shooting heroin?  Anyway he started on pot and ended up on heroin.

      Did that get your attention? Good.  I have a question for the dozen or so people that may read this. Let's imagine I have just won a fantastic amount of money in the lottery. You find out about it thru one of the many full page ads I have taken out in every major American newspaper. It reads something like this:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  "I have decided that I have no real need for this much money, and I would like to spend $20,000,000 of my winnings on something that will benefit mankind. Therefore I am now accepting plans for the dispersement of these funds to a deserving cause."  "The person or persons that I decide have the best suggestion for the cause this money should be dispursed to may choose to either accept a one million dollar award, or forfeit the award in which case I will donate $25,000,000 to their chosen cause."  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Two part question:  1) What would you want the money to be spent on? 2) Would you turn down the one million dollars to see an extra 5 million go to your chosen cause?
