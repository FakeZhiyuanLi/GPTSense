Wooo I woke up pretty early again.:) and I took a shower yup, I m nice and clean, I always am :) After my wonderful shower, i got ready for a very important day. It was the day that Christina and I were gonna work out, YAY. So I went to pick up my little sister mari, I didn't see my obsessors until I got to Del mar to pick up ariana. I saw my obsessors, they aren't really bad looking. After that I went to pick up christina, i saw her turtle, itz huge!!! Then we went back to my casa, we ate sandwiches, got dressed. My mother went to take us to soquel for our working permit. then we went to go do some excercise, we did the whole shebang, crunches, push ups, lunges, and frog leaps oh ya and bridges!! LOL Agter are little excercise we went to run up and down the bleachers adn then we went up the big Soquel hill, it was some work out. Then we went down a hill, then we went up this other really steep hill, but it was easier. then me and christina went adventuring around the bottom of the trail where itz scary. This was while ariana and mari went a different way, they didn't wanna adventure w/ us. Then we were remembering past times @ Soquel it was wonderful, then we went to our spot and waited for my mother. Then we went to the mall, just me and christina, we felt disgusting cuz we were all sweaty. We saw tanya, Teresa and rebecca, we really wanna kill tanya and teresa, but we are kool w/ Rebecca. I had a world record 2day, me and ariana didn't fight this whole day today YAY!!!!! yesterday was a horrible figth LOL. OMG and u know who else we saw @ the mal?? we saw Houston Buffington. I LOVE Her we used to be like best friends, but now she lives in stockton. Then we saw rebecca and Maricela. I wanna kill Maricela too YUCK. Then we went to go put on makeup on at Gottschalks, i'm not that great w/ it, but christina does a good job putting it on me. I looked adorable, jk, but I found out that I have cat eyes LOL.then after the mall we walked home. We sat in my room and laughed and started to go crazy again, cuz we didn't know wat to do. Then we decided to go to Rite-Aid and so we did, but we also ended up going to the mall again. This was wen we saw Houston, Rebecca, maricela oooh and then we found some very important ppl, their names are, are u ready??!!! we saw TINA and AMY!!!!!!!!!!!!YAY!!!!!! they are soo kool, they were eating fries and we decided to join them so we did, don't worry we didn't eat all their fries. they are so kool, we talked about different things like umm... guyz...fries...guyz...and all the lies...ya, some certain ppl out their, right tina??!!names will not be mentioned LOL. But then we had to go bcuz we supposedly only went to rite-aid so it was about tym we headed home, so we did. And then we ate dinner yum...Then carlos took us for ice cream so we walked bak to baskin Robins and we walked bak home, we seriously walked like 20 miles today LOL!!!!I hope I get skinnier :) plz...plz...Then we were home and we sat down and talked about different things like wat we're gonna do tomorrow and wat were gonna do w/ some ppl. And our plan to practice...very important things that have to do w/ life...and all day i've been missing someone...yes u guessed it again, i don't know, but your really smart cuz u know who I m always thinkin about. Oh ya I died again today like yesterday, but this tym chrsitna joined me in the afterlife, it was great!!!! we had fun up there, I think it was up there...hopefully. Now I m just writing in my blog. So, ya while I've been writing this blog I've had christina by my side.     OH YAH!!!!!! As I said Christina and I ran up the soquel hill, my inspiration for this wonderfulness that we did was GARDENIA!!!!!!!!!!

         2day, well... In the morning I woke up @ like 10, ya I know pretty early 4 me at least. Then I chatted w/ Christina on the phone for like an hour around 10:30. We were chattin 4ever!!!!! oew!!!! Then I went to pick up mari @ 11 i didn't see my admireres :( Then I went to pick up Ariana and I saw my cousin, Alan, yay, i hadn't talked to him in 4ever. Then I went home, I went on the computer and was listening to music and then Carlos came he freaked me out. oew scary!!!!then we went to go get pizza and Jumba juice. I ate 2 slices of pizza after already eating lunch. Then guess who showed up??!!! yup u guessed it CHRISTINA!!!!!!!Oew!!!It was funnnn... first we just hung out in my room and we started going crazy th@ I started talking to myself on the computer and christina started doing bridges on my floor. It was great, but then we went outside so we wouldn't go too crazy and I started getting in this horrible fight with ariana and mari, they r weak cuz they needed 2 ppl to beat moi!!!! I got a horrible wedgie eeew...I think I won, but my mom stopped us LOL. Me and christina just sat on the trampoline and talked and christina busted her arm... so sad :( Then we walked to Rite-Aid and christina took her camera and the stupid lady at Rite-Aid said that Kodak said that my camera only had 12 pix that was dumb because it was a 27 picture camera. We kept calling nathalie, but she never answered. Then we got Ice cream @ rite-Aid the crazy thing is that this tym we all got double scoops. I finished it ALL!!! and christina only ate half. Then we came home and we were taking care of turtles and I talked to Gardenia on the telephone after I hadn't talked 2 her 4ever. YAY!!! I made salad and I went PoTtY!!!!! :) DB moment hee hee. We ate dinner after that and christina thinks I m starving myself, cuz I ate 2 tacos, rice and a salad, I don't think itz called starving yourself wen u just had a double scoop ice cream. LOL!!! anywayz we were already supposed to be on our diet, but I guess that starts tomorrow. Afterwards we came bak to my room to plan a very special occassion, but it turns out itz gonna have to be post-poned for at least another 2 months :( I'm gonna cry, wait no christina's gonna cry HEE HEE!!! we had everything ready too!!!!! ugh...And now I m writing everything down woo, sounds like fun right??!! oh ya and we also spent much tym on the telephone chit-chattin w/ some peeps LOL if u know wat I mean...LOL...         WEll I g2g luv ya all very much good-Bye                            *~* LUV, Lil'C*~*

        Alright I can't remember very well how this day started or wat I did, but I remember I talked to Christina on the phone and we started planning the players club, cuz it was gonna be at nigth. So I talked to her on the phone and she said she was gonna come over on the bus, so we could convince my parents that I could spend the nigth at her house. Then I think I had to do something, so we stopped talking on the phone. Then Nathalie called me telling me that we should go to the movies and watch    THE VILLAGE.    Well I knew that     we probly couldn't go, plus I had to spend the night at Christina's. So then she came over and I was telling her about it, and I was like u should go, plus there had been a very cute guy at the mall who told them about it!!! hee hee....well we watched  room raiders,  there was this girl that had such a messy room, it was sooo gross!!!! DISGUSTING, she even had a pig in her house!!! eeeeewww.....well, ya we watched that lol!! then we went into my room and I'm pretty sure that we were listening to music, I can't remember very well. Well then Christina came, I can't remember wat tym she showed up either hee hee....well, Christina asked nathalie if she was gonna go to the player's club and nathalie said no I think. So, then I had to go to the bank, to get dinero for the player's club and we started walking. Then Nathalie stole my sisters and took them to the mall, ya I noticed, but we had to go on buisness and they were supposed to come along, but they didn't. So, we went tot the bank and then we went looking for them at the mall, but we couldn't find them. Then we started walking to Rite-Aid, so we got to Rite-Aid and we were about to order, when we saw my sister walk into the store without Nathalie!! They said that she wasn't feeling good, so she went to her grandma's. hmm....well we bought our ice-cream. I bought Rocky Road yumm....then we headed back home and me and chrisitna were just sitting around in my room. then we were gonna ask if I could spend the night, but ariana and mari wouldn't let christina go, it was like alil wrestling match kind of LOL!!!!then we finally go through and we asked and he said he had to think about it, and when he thought about it, he said I had to get home at least @ 10:30. So I went to discuss with Christina and she said that it was alrigth, except I might have to leave earlier, cuz she had cheerleading at 10 the next morning so I told my dad I had to be home even earlier, so he let me go. We ate dinner and then he dropped us off at Christina's. We made some coffee yumm...Christina's coffee is the  BEST!!!!  Then we kinda started getting ready, around 8:30, then we called nathalie to see if maybe she changed her mind and wanted to go, but she didn't :(!!!!! So we got ready, got dressed, put on some makeup, u know the usual routine. Then her brother took us. When we got to the player's club, it was soo lonely. and there were like no guyz dancing , only girlz, so we sat for a while and then we decided we were gonna dance. So we went to dance on the floor and then the middle block was with less ppl so we got on it and started dancing, it was MUCHO fun!!!! Then we went to the bathroom, cuz we got   HOT   so then christina was telling me how she wanted me to do something, and I was too embarassed to do it. haha, anywayz we went back out and we danced some more, sometyms we were on the spotlight :) !!!!! Christina kept trying to make me do the thing, but I wouldn't. Then l8er I saw that my cousin was there, adn 1 of Jonny's friends. then we decided to sit down and we decided to leave, I think their was a fight, i dunno....watever, not like I really care. then we went back to Christina's adn we started to watch Zorro, o yah and we had this really yummy ice-cream. so we watched zorro, but then I asked her about  the sims  game so we went onto her computer, but we didn't play the sims we played    Tetris Attack    I think thatz wat itz called. Well first she was playing and I was blabbing on about retard stuff, I dunno, I can't remember, but then we played 2 player and that was sooo much FUN!!! it was sooo funny 2...heee hee...then I did blab on about who knows wat, and we were soo into the game it was hilarious, someone should've video taped us, that way wenever we get depressed, we could watch ourselves and laugh and laugh, that would probly always turn us into a good mood lol!!!! well then we went to "bed" even thought we were on her floor talking about elementary until like 3 A.M.. lol it was sooo much fun!!! well ya then eventually we fell asleep!!!

        I can't really remember much of this day. I just remember that nathalie came over and we were listening to music and we talked to Christina on the phone for a while it was pretty fun. Then Brandon came over and nathalie was doing his hair. It was all fixed, then we decided to go outside, so we went outside to jump on the trampoline, it was really really fun!!! We jumped and I flew up pretty high. Then after that, Nathalie and Brandon wanted to go to the mall, so I went to ask and my mom aid i could go. So we went and we just walked around, and I put on a whole bunch of makeup at Macys. I wanted the makeup, but it was like $20 for just one color, so i didn't get it. DUH!!! well...then we went into the foodcourt and we just sat around and we saw maria and the girl that is always with her. They were just sitting there with us, we were chattin. Then Brandon went to go sit with Kate and Naomi. So we were just there with maria, it was pretty kool. Then Nathalie was like poking me and I didn't know why, adn then she was like "cruz's brother", so i turned around and It was him!!! omg!!! after that I was kinda iffy about the mall, and well...after that I was freaking out, cuz there was a possiblilty I would see him. So, then we decided to leave, Thank goodness!!! i was feeling sick!!! then we walked towards my house, but nathalie got picked up and bradnon went with teena to the tracks I think. well then I just walked home and really did nothin at all. then we got told that we were gonna go to San Jose the next morning, so we were deciding wether or not we should go. We decided we were gonna go cuz we were gonna go to the Great Mall!!!!!!YAY!!!! well, then we just went to bed. And that was all of my day. BUH BYE!!!!!!!!!    **LUV,LIL'C**

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ok, I woke up this morning around 10:45. This tym I had not a single dream, well at least none that I could remember.&nbsp;         Once I was awake and did my usual routine, u know make-up, do my bed all that stuff. I thought to myself, while I was listening to a song by   Pilar Montenegro   called    Quitame ese Hombre.      I was thinking do I even like Cruz anymore?? I have no clue wat my feeling are right now, itz all numb. Yesterday I thought I still missed him and I thought I still liked him, but this morning I just didn't feel the same . Rigth now I'm chewing on the winterfresh gum, and it doesn't even taste the same as it once did.&nbsp;Then I'm thinking that maybe I don't know wat I feel for him, bcuz I'm scared of wat could happen if I still like him or even go out with him again. I don't want anything bad to happen to anyone.&nbsp; I still think I miss him though, like deep inside of me, but right now I don't feel anything, I'm just numb. I hope everything turns out well in the end.    Well, after I had this thinkitive moment, I was basically cleaning my room and then I decided to vacumm so I could help my mom with something, then I decided to help her with ironing, but she thougth I was too slow, so I stopped.&nbsp; Then we wen to eat lunch it was yummy...hmm... lemme think, I didn't do much. I called Christina, adn I was talking to her for a while, then she ahd to go, I think I called her l8er again, but then she had to go again. I still got to talk to her for quite a while though. I talked to Nathalie online. Then I got a call from Gardenia, she told me she was at the mall and if I wanted to come. So I decided, why not?? I ahev nothing else better to do. So I went to the mall, I met her around Claires. I hadn't seen her in such a loong tym. We were talking, but then palafox called her and we met him at the foodcourt. umm...we were kinda hangin out with him for a while, until like 5:30ish. Then Gardenia's mom had to pick her up, she asked her mom if she could come over to my house and she said she couldn't. So then she asked if I could come over, and she said yes, but I had to still ask my parents. So we went to my house and I asked, and surprisingly they said yes. So I went to Gardenia's house. We talked about a lot of things. I hadn't talked to her in soo long.&nbsp; Then we went for a walk to Phil's and we bought some ice cream and I bought some winterfresh gum, cuz i had ran out of it. So, we went back to her house and then we called Cruz, I really didn't wanna call him, I didn't know wat I was gonna say. the thing is that I like talking to him when I'm alone, cuz then when I'm with someone I feel like i can't tell him wat i wanna tell him. And I also feel like I can't be on the phone for as long as I may want to. Thatz my reason for not wanting to call cruz when I'm around ppl, so I don't want u guyz to take it personal or anything. Cuz a lot of ppl have tried making me call cruz and itz when they around. and If their is a chance with me and cruz again, I wanna try it on my own, I know u guyz may wanna help, but I wanna try it on my own.&nbsp;THX, I'd really appreciate it!!! well, umm...anywayz ya, no one answered and gardenia left a message, so he'll probly end up calling my cell. Well, I'm gonna try calling him probly tomorrow, if I can, I think his family is like on vacation or something. Well after that wwe umm...talked and talked it was kool!!! well&nbsp;then I came home around 10 and then I turned on the computer, listened to music adn wrote in my blog. Oh yah and I'm still not over cruz, cuz I had a couple of kinda like flashbacks, so even though I thougth I was over him earlier, now I think I'm not. well ya, I'm gonna go now BUH BYE!!!!!

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up this morning around 10:30. I was jsut thinkin about the dream I had last nigth, well I think I had 2 separate dreams last night...The 1st&nbsp; dream goes like this:        I was with Gardenia, and some other ppl and then we saw riannon next door and gardenia and the other ppl were just making fun of her, cuz I guess they didn't like her. ya, and then we were just running around like the mall, it was really weird.  (ok 2nd dream was:)          My dad took us to a restaurant, except the restaurant was kinda like, well it had a rollercoaster, houses, ppl's yards and dressing rooms. Alright, so&nbsp;I saw Cruz, and I was kinda like *wat r u doin here?* but u know I was happy to see him. Well we went to the roller Coaster, except gardenia was there 2   .&nbsp; the weird thing was that this tym we weren't in the same order as my last 2 dreams, this tym cruz was in the middle. Cruz and gardenia were talking about in wat seat they were gonna sit in, and I just remember thinking *ugh...and I was just bored and I felt, I dunno... itz hard to explain* But then like all of sudden cruz turns to me and he start talking to me   (something else happened, but I feel stupid saying it, cuz I think it might kinda be in part to a connection of nathalie's dream LOL)&nbsp;   so, then we were all over each other&nbsp; again, well not like that, it was just the way we were at  Del Mar  and at his   Church.   So, we ended up going on the roller coaster together. I remember being soo happy. Then there was another part to my dream, when carlos and Jonny were both there. And cruz went over with Jonny and Jonny had some weed, isn't that just great. And I remember telling cruz, "Don't take it, plz, do it 4 me!!" LOL and then Carlos was like "Don't take it, do it 4 me!!" but carlos only did that cuz he knew if he said that, cruz&nbsp;would take it and I would be mad at cruz. Well of course cruz wasn't gonna take it 4 carlos, so he took it. ugh.. I was soo mad at Carlos, bcuz I knew why he had said that. ugh...I remember being soo mad at him.&nbsp; So, Cruz and Jonny were both kinda retarded cuz they were both well, ya...  that was pretty much my whole dream well ya anywayz back to my day:     &nbsp;

       &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    OMG this sux!!!!!!!! I wrote like this loong blog for today, and my computer was retarded and erased the whole thing!!!!!!!!!! ugh...now I have to write it all over again!!!!!!!!!        &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ok, well, has anyone ever though about how many things can run through your mind, in like one minute? &nbsp;2day I was thinking for a couple of minutes and my mind was running through tons and tons of memories and ideas of different things. Itz pretty crazy, how someone can just think of soo much in such lil tym.        &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anywayz, about my day. 2day I was woken up by my aunt who told us to go outside and watch the warf-to-warf thing, it was pretty boring , we just watched all those ppl passing by, sweating and running, kinda dumb. anywayz after about a half an hour of ppl watching we went inside and ate breakfast, it was really yummy....scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, and bread. We watched    Chicken Run   it was a funny movie, except I don't think we even finished watching it, o well.&nbsp; hmmm...then our uncle decided to take us to the park at Del Mar, it was kinda boring, but u know their were a whole bunch of memories running through my mind. Well we weren't there that long, but long enough. Then we headed back to their house. We decided to walk around the apartment and that was pretty boring. Then we decided we wanted to watch     Scary Movie 3  , that was a really funny movie, I love it!! hmm.. then while we were watching the movie we ate lunch, we had a sandwich and chips, it was yummy...hmm..then around 4ish my dad called us telling us that he was gonna pick us up. So we got ready and then he showed up with Liza, we said our&nbsp;"hellos" and then we said our&nbsp;"goodbyes" and "thank yous" We headed home in Liza's gigantic red car. When we got home we just sat around and talked&nbsp;(in spanish) hee hee. My dad doesn't want us to&nbsp;forget our first language, so now we have to speak spanish around the house. &nbsp;hmm...then Liza was about to leave and then nathalie called, I told her I would call her right back. SO I said good-bye to Liza. She's goin to Wisconsin on thursday! hmm.. so then I called nathalie back and talked to her for a while. Then I got a call from Jonny telling me if he thought dad would let him spend the nigth, bcuz he's gonna go to&nbsp;a concert tonite, I was like probly, and then he talked to dad, so he's probly stayin. Then right after I called Christina and talked to her, we caught up on each other's lives and we talked, but then I had to get off the phone. I went to the store with my dad to go get water and buy chicken. Then I got home and kept listening to music. Then Nathalie called me like rigth b4 9 and we talked for a while. ooh, after I got off the phone with her, I just layed on my bed thinking, thatz when I figured out how much thinkin someone could do. hmm...then I just came to write in this blog. ooh ya...rememebr how one tym, I was like there isn't a single 12 hours that I don't think about cruz?? well, itz still true, cuz last night I had&nbsp;ANOTHER dream and he was in it. My dream was:             Ok, my dream starts off on the first day of skool. I was walking with nathalie this tym, and we were walking to get our schedules. We got our schedules, and I remember we were walking in the 2nd quad and I remember looking over to where the bathrooms are and I saw Cruz, and Daryl together, like alwayz. So I remember thinking *Omg!! wat am I gonna say? Should I even talk to him? ugh...wat am I gonna do??* then me and nathalie passed by them and I looked at him and just smiled at him. Then I remember like walking around the skool for fun, I guess. then I saw him again, again we were in 2nd quad and this tym I was like on the side thatz like by the little hill thing and cruz was like on the other side of the 2nd quad, by the parking lot, he was with a whole bunch of ppl, I can't remember who though and I remember he like was waving and I dunno, in my dream it made it seem like he was telling my why I wasn't talking to him and he was just like "hi" and waving his hands, and I remember being like "HI" oooh, adn then I remember him, and a whole bunch of ppl were gonna ditch and do something. I can't remember wat they were gonna do, but I knew it was something that if they were caught doing they would get in soo much trouble.!!!&nbsp;O wait, I remeber wat he was wearing, he was wearing like a blue striped shirt, I can also remember that Daryl was wearing like a tan colored striped shirt. hmm...then I remember I couldn't find my classroom, but then I found it, it was a strange class. then we went to our next class and that was a REALLY REALLY weird class, cuz we had to like run across these train tracks, except they were like rotten boxes, I dunno...it was weird, we had to try to survive in that class. It was really strange.        &nbsp;

       &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wat is there to do in life, in order to be prefectly happy?? Is there a single person out there who is totally happy? if anyone ever finds someone who is perfectly happy give them my # so I could get some lessons on being happy. I don't know if thinking about one person for soo long is healthy. I know smiling is healthy. Even though I still smile a lot, sometyms they're just fake and sometyms, the real smiles happen very little during the day. I can't let one person get to me, so I'm gonna have to bring all those real smiles back. I just need to find things to do during the day that will keep me occupied and let me forget about that person at least for a while. I have tried many things, even when I went to the river in Ben Lomond, I only forgot about him for like a ver lil bit, but then I was once again reminded. I dunno wat to do, everytym I try to call him, something hapens and I don't end up talking to him. Like that one tym he was sleeping and then I've called him like&nbsp;3 tyms today already and no one answers. And then one tym carlos came so I couldn't call him, mebe this means I'm not supposed to happen??!! O well, I'm just gonna keep on trying until I can finally talk to him...     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ok, well 2day I was awoken by my mother, she told us that we had to go watch my cousin play his championship soccer game at Estrella Del Mar. So we woke up and this was around umm...9ish. hmm... we watched the game, it started @ 11. They lost :( 5 to 1. My cousin made that one goal for his team.&nbsp; After the game I went home and well...sat at the house at the computer, I think...I talked to Christina on the phone for a while, ya, I'm pretty sure I did. Then I was talking to nathalie for a while on the phone. Then She called me @ 3ish and I was talking to her and then I told her I would call her back, bcuz I was gonna attempt calling cruz. This was around 3:30. No one answered the phone :(.Then l8er nathalie called me asking me if she could come over and I was like "YA!!" So she came over around uumm...I think it was around 5. She came into my room and then I saw a message from&nbsp;Gardenia on IM and I called her, I was talking to her for awhile, it was kool, cuz I haven't talked to her for a while :)!!! Well after I got off the phone with her I noticed that my cousins were here, so I went outside to say hello and give them all hugs and kisses. Then I went back into my room&nbsp;with nathalie, where she was downloading some music and I heard about 2 new songs, I LOVE the songs. &nbsp;They are very depressing though, well at least to me :(!!!! Then while my sisters and cousins were swimming, nathalie got a phone call from her mother saying that she had to go to Mervyns, and nathalie's mom didn't even tell her why. So we asked for permission from my father and he let us go, so we went almost running cuz nathalie was really worried, we went in through the food court. We saw Ivan (nathalie's brother) he was being annoying, cuz he tried to trip nathalie. So we just kept on going to Mervyns, and when we found Nathalie's mom, she was like "Where's Ivan?" She had called nathalie, cuz she couldn't find Ivan...and we had just seen him in the food court. It was crazy, then we went to buy some Cherry Lemonade yum... it was really SWEET!!!!! Then we walked back to my house, and on the walk back home&nbsp;we saw a car that looked just like Christina's mom's car and then we realized it was christina. We said "hi" and ya, she was goin to the mall. Then there were these&nbsp;2 guyz&nbsp;on their bikes and I dunno...but they said something&nbsp;and I was just like "SHUT UP!!!!" and then I think they called&nbsp;me a bitch...I don't really know, but I just kept yelling&nbsp;at them to "SHUT UP!!!!!" HAHAH&nbsp;well, when we came back to my house, we were playing music over and over, it was soo depressing. ugh... then we decided to go eat dinner. In my mind I was like thinking to ask nathalie if a sundae would make her feel better adn then she was like " do u think we can be able to got to Baskin Robins and get sundaes?" adn I was like "thatz exactly wat i was thinking. Then my mother came to eat dinner. So I went outside, to ask my dad if we could go to Rite-Aid and he almost didn't let us, but then he was like hurry up. So we left, while my sisters and my cousins were in ariana's room playing some game. So we walked to baskin Robins and bought our sundaes, mine was really yummy....then we walked into Albertsons, cuz ariana wanted us to get her like 4 bags of hot Cheetos. So we were there and ya, then we walked back home and we were crazy again, on the walk back, we were just screaming in the streets, not just screaming, but we were SCREAMING!!!!!!!!! adn SINGING SOO LOUD!!!!!!!!! we were just like watever, no one is gonna be able to see us anywayz. They might hear us, but not see us. It was really GREAT!!! It felt soo good when we were jsut yelling in the middle of the streets, I dunno, it just felt soo good. I wanna do that again, like in the middle of nowhere. So, then we just got home and umm... we listened to some new music, well she downloaded another song, by Brandy, it is soo connected to us. I love it!!!!So, ya and then her mom came to pick her up :( I still talked to her like really really quickly online after that. then , I was just with my cousins, adn I wrote the beginging of this post. But then my cousins asked if I wanted to spend the nigth adn I was like "sure..." But i needed to take a shower, adn it was like 10:30, so I took like a 5 min shower adn then we got to their house and watched tv and ya, then we went to be like @ 12:30. adn that was that for that day!!!!!&nbsp; Oh yah, and I called cruz @ 3:00, no one asnwered, then I caleld @ 6:00, no one answered, then I called one last tym @ 9:oo and again no one answered. Mebe, it was cuz Icalled with the cell phone, adn he has caller ID, so mebe he doesn't wanna talk to me?? Who knows!!!???not me!!!!! O well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GOODBYE!!!!!!!!!!      **LUV,LIL'C**     DONT FORGET THE COMMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!

       &nbsp;  &nbsp; Alright I woke up to a normal morning, wait except for the fact that I had been woken up by a terrible nightmare. there&nbsp; ppl dying, ppl screaming, ppl drowning, ppl fighting, ppl trying to get a job. this was one of the most randomest dreams I've ever had, cuz I dunno how my dream connected to my life. All i can say now is that I am afraid of trains, especially when they go over a bridge. Ok, well anywayz I woke up and ate breakfast, u know the usual daily routine. umm...lemme see nothin much happened and nathalie called me around hmm...I can't remember the tym it was...o well. Anywayz she wanted to come over so she did. Once she was here we just sat in my room and I was debating wether or not I was gonna call cruz. Well I was about to like 20 tyms. then nathalie straightened her hair with our curling iron hee hee. and we talked to Christina, and she told us about her dream, ooh and nathalie told me about her dream totally GROSS!!!! I seriously can't imagine that heppening, not hat I want to or anything eeeewww!!!.......alrigth well, I decided to curl my hair and then we decided we wanted to go to the mall, so I had to go ask my mom. I asked her and mari wanted to go, so we had to wait for her. Then their was a knock on the door and it was this lady that was trying to sell a book, I love the book, cuz it seriously looks like it could help us out with hw!!! anywayz I love the lady too, she was soo kool. She told us, me and nathalie that I guy only grows in mentality to be up to 12 years old haha...so watever guy is our age rigth now, in mentality is really only 2 years old hahaha thatz soo funny....she was like "I haven't had a single boyfriend that hasn't cried on my shoulder" In my mind I was like wow, thatz crazy... Anywayz we convinced my mom and dad to buy the book, that means she is gonna come visit us like in August kool...alrigth well, she soon left and then nathalie got a call from her mother and we ran to the mall, it was pretty tiring. We went anywayz though, then we went to the food court and nathalie bought some fries and cherry lemondae yumm....well then we saw maria the questionaire...heee heee.Ok so then went back to my house and me and nathalie just sat around in my room and I was going crazy cuz I dind't know if I should call him or not. And then I decided to get happy, so I remembered wat always made me laugh, which was remember that ppl look soo funny upside down, so I layed upside down on my bed and I loooked at nathalie she looked soo funny upside down. Just imagine your bottom lip being your top lip. U know wat u guyz should really try looking at someone upside down LOL!!! Anywayz thatz wat started my craziness. Then I was just going crazy with laugther. And then nathalie found her song and we started singing to it and it was funny cuz we were soo loud, and then christina came so we decided to do the song again, and this tym we were twice as loud. Well at first we couldn't find chrisitna cuz she was hiding from us LOL!!!!she even scared me....ok, so we sang and then ooh we found out we were having a barbeque that was totally unplanned . then lemme see we were watching fear factor, ooh pretty scary , these ppl had to go in the water with crocodiles oooh....after that I was like falling asleep kinda during that. before that I was chasing Christina around the house, bcuz she had to call someone, itz not fair, cuz i didn't want anyone to call cruz, but they did anywayz, the thing is that I wanna do it on my own and then u guyz alwayz lie to me, cuz I know u guyz called him and u tell me u didn't. Plz...lemme TRY to do it on my own. well anywayz after that I was basically umm.. I guess depressed, cuz christina says that when I am depressed I start drawing stars, cuz thatz wat I did last tym, and I did that 2day, so i guess I was depressed. Nathalie soon had to leave:( soo sad...then I was with Christina and we were talking about everything....ans how or wat we are gonna do to stop the depression. then she had to leave too :( so I was left all alone and then I got ready to go to bed and then I went on the computer and created a quiz and then I wrote in my blog and now I'm gonna listen to music on my CD player, which is probly gonna get me more depresesed, o welll......goodnight!!!!!      **LUV,LIL'C**

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WOW!!! I can't beleive itz been 2 months since that one day that made my life a drama lol...well I woke up this morning around 8:30ish, I was planning on sleeping in 2day, cuz yesterday I woke up at 5, but I guess that didn't end up happening. O well!!! Well, I realized, even though I knew I still liked cruz, I think I still like him too much, cuz I had another dream about him last night, their were tears, and happiness, and angry parts, it was a mixed up dream, thir were many ppl in them too. Lemme see, I was in the dream LOL, cruz, carlos, Jonny, Ariana, Mari, gardenia, and uhh... I think that was all, I'm soo sorry if I&nbsp; didn't dream about u.&nbsp; well, the dream is too long, so I'll explain to u l8er.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, so ya, I realized that there&nbsp;aren't&nbsp;any 12 hours that I don't think of cruz, isn't that soo sad :(!!! cuz, I had a dream about him and then all day I was thinkin about him...ugh...i just can't get him outta my mind, I was gonna try calling him again 2day, but I didn't cuz I was around my parents like 24/7.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, well anywayz back to my day, I woke up and found out that I had to go to Ben Lomond to&nbsp; pick up my grandma from my aunt's house and my mom told us that she was gonna take us to the river, so we took our bathing suits. well, we drove over to Ben Lomond and once I got there I called nathalie :)!!! and I talked to her for a bit. Then we took our cousins and our cousin's cousin to the river. we got there and got dressed and walked down to the river. there was no one there, so we got the river all to ourselves. it was soo much fun too, I didn't really think that I was gonna have fun, but I did. It was really freezing at first, but eventually we got used to it. After we were swimming in there for a while we went to eat, but after we ate, we just went straight back into the water, again, it was cold, but I ended up getting used to it. I had a lotta fun.!!!! Ok, so around 3:30 we left and we got the around 11:30, so we were there for about 4 hours WOW!!!!!!!!! alrigth, so after the river we went to my aunt's house, and I was soo tired of being there, i wanted to leave really bad and then finally we left and we ended up taking the cousins and my aunt with us, we went straight to the mall, and I felt soo disgusting, thank goodness I didn't see anyone important, I think!!!LOL!!well i Bought a sqeeze pop yumm....wait didn't I just buy one like 2 days ago haha...o well...Alright I got tired of the mall, soo I asked my mom if I could walk home with mari, cuz I was tired of it, she let us, yay...I walked home and, ariana didn't wanna come with us, cuz I think she has a crush on our cousin's cousin. Ok, so we got home and I just kinda got there and felt soo much better. I called nathalie I talked to her for a while. then I called christina, but she was at Cheerleading. and umm...then l8er I talked to nathalie once more for a lil bit. then wat had been on my mind all day was to call cruz, but I didn't.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;oh, yah and when we were at the river, ariana told me that Liza knows. For those of u who don't know who liza is, she is my older sister, and she is 27 years old. Well, ariana says that she knows about me and cruz, or she thinks she knows, cuz she only knows what carlos and Jonny know. I'm not sure if they know or not that we aren't together anymore. Well ariana said that she&nbsp;is gonna talk to my mom and dad and see if they know about anything, according to ariana she isn't gonna tell them anything, she is just gonna play&nbsp;dumb, and wants to know about me and my life. Watever, I'm just going with the flow, watever happens, happens, and I think that watever happens, happens for a reason, so we will see l8er on&nbsp;wat the reason for&nbsp;all of this is.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hmm...well ya when I got home, I was just kinda here and I was actually kinda talking a lot with my parents and stuff. Oh yah we also went to visit my aunt who is visiting from mexico. it was kinda boring over there, o well, and from there we went to buy pizza yumm... umm then I came home and watched home videos with my mom and dad, well actually it was of the video I took yesterday in the mountains. yup, thatz pretty much&nbsp;it...Oh, and my mom made&nbsp;2 french tail braids, they look soo cute I love them...well I'm getting tired, so I'm gonna go to sleep GOODNIGHT!!!!!      **LUV,LIL'C**  &nbsp;    P.S don't 4get that comment!!! hee hee

Then I went potty and Ariana said she saw them all pass by LOL!!!!! ya, well then I went on the computer and talked to Nathalie and Gardenia and then I was listening to music.&nbsp; Soon, while I was singing along to "My all" my cousins came over cuz they were all gonna go for a swim in our pool, It was kool, oh and I was on the phone with nathalie at this tym.

So I went for a hot tub run, I didn't go in my pool, but I went in the hot tub, it was pretty kool. After I was there for a while, i went inside and I was talking to tina online and then I decided I was gonna call cruz. I dialed the #'s, and my heart was beating pretty fast. There was an answer on the phone, I asked if Jose was there, but his mom said that he was sleeping, and it was only like 7:30.

I was planning on calling cruz 2day, but carlos came so i can't call him when carlos is around. YES, i still&nbsp;like Cruz, I just thought some of u should know!!lol&nbsp; ok, so we were planning to go the movies with carlos, so we were gonna go around 12, but then it got too late so we decided to go to Shrek 2&nbsp; @ 4:00. I was talking to nathalie on the phone and I invited her to go the movies with us.&nbsp; She called me back and she said she could go. YAY!!!!!!! So we left around like 3:30, and we&nbsp;went to pick up nathalie at her house and then we drove to cinema 9. We bought tickets to Shrek 2, then we asked carlos if we could go watch "i, Robot" , he said yes, so then me and nathalie had to buy something to much on, and to drink, so we bought like this umm... I forget wat itz called, but it was HILARIOUS!!!!!!! LOL!!!! ok, we went into the movie adn we were like laughing like crazy, and then we saw a someone look alike adn it was scary, but funny. Then we were pretty calm during the movie. I think that all that resting came out of us when we got out of the movies. Oh, ya, the movie was such a good movie, I LOVED it !!!!!!! ok, well we got out of the movie adn we were like looking for that look alike adn it didn't seem much like a look a like anymore hahaha...ok so we left and there were some creepy ppl looking at me and Nathalie hee hee...ok so we went outside the theatre and I saw my cousin with some girls, how weird, I didn't know he actually hung out with girls hee hee...Anywayz, we saw the ex look alike adn then we were looking for carlos adn my sisters, adn we found them across the street haha I can't belleive that I couldn't even see them there. Well we decided to go get some sundaes yumm.....me adn nathalie were like going crazy , adn laughing like crazy since we got out of the theatre. We were just walking adn there was this person that smelled really bad, I had to run into the closest store, cuz it was some bad B.O YUCK!!!!!!! SO afterwards, we just kept walking, and we walked into Marinis, yumm...if we bought a sundae, u could buy another one free.&nbsp; So, nathalie bought herself one, and then I got her free one. It was yummy...I had Caramel in it yumm... ok then we sat on our table, adn OMG!!!!!!!! it was sooo funny...heee...heee. I had to go potty hee hee adn we were just sitting there ont he tables, and me adn nathalie actually seemed high, bcuz we were laughing like crazy, but u know we wouldn't get high, so don't worry. We were only high off of life LOL!!!!! ok, so then we walked into umm... wat is that place called again??? hmm... oh yah, I think it was Starbucks. I got to go into their potty, cuz I had to go really really bad!!!! anywayz then we walked back to the car and I was like screaming in the parking lot, I swear me and Nathalie were like CRAZY!!!!!!!!! It was mucho fun, right nathalie *WINK* *WINK* OK, so then we went to drop off nathalie, and Carlos was being mean cuz he wouldn't drop her off at her&nbsp; house ugh...he can be soo mean sometyms. alright so then we drove abck home adn i was home adn I called christina to see how her cheerleading practice was and to see if she could spend the night. YAY, she was able to. So she said she would be at my house around umm... I dunno, she said she would be here though. So, Christina came around 7:30 i think, and I had somethin very very importante to tell her, it was these little things&nbsp; that carlos kept bringing up, the first was that he thougth christina was a bad influence on me LOL!!!!! WATEVER!!!! adn then he was like, " so, been to any bonfires lately??" I was like no, I've never been to one" adn he just started laughing and said that bonfires adn me were funny. I was just like watever. And then he a was like "so, how is cruz these days?"&nbsp; and I was like "good" and then he said" he broke up with u didn't he?" and I was like " uuh, no." I said that bcuz I didn't want him to bug me about it. Then l8er that night when I was with Christina in the palm tree room, we watched some t.v and then we decided to do some Ouija, so we took it out adn asked it a couple questions.

It was a very difficult job, but it was pretty fun, spending some cleaning tym with my mother LOL!!! Ok so after that I called nathalie and asked if she was having her yard sale and she was so I told her I would stop by. So we drove over there adn then I asked my mom if I could stay with her and she said yes. So we were there outside in her front yard. then I went into her room and I was watching tv adn looking through her magazines, it was pretty fun. We called chrisitna, but she was asleep :(. Then afterwards we headed to nathalie's cousin's birthday party, Kim Padilla was there!! It was pretty fun, yumm....Smirnoffs!!!!!!!!!!I don't know if thatz how u spell it. Ok after we ate , we jsut chilled. Then we were getting in depression mode, so we asked Nathalie's mom if we could leave the party and go to my house, she said yes. So from&nbsp; there we took the bus and we took it to Jose park. Then we walked from teh park all the way to our depression place :( we cried, nathalie beat me though LOL!!!!! after that we took the tracks to my house. we both had weapon, i had a bottle, adn nathalie had a stick, becuz Jonny, once told me that he didn't want me on the tracks after 7 bcuz u could get raped, so we were super cautious. hee hee. When we got to my house, we asked the Ouija like 2 questions and we were done with that, then nathalie left...soo sad. I kept trying to call christina, but no one answered. :(&nbsp; I just sat in my room, listening to music. Then we had to go to bed and nathalie slept with me and we did some Ouija. He still Likes me!!!!!!!!! according to the Ouija YAY!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok, then I listened to music and that was it....well I gotta go BUH BYE!!!!!!!!  **LUV,LIL'C**  &nbsp;    &nbsp;

She told me I had to be ready by the tym he came for lunch, which is around 12:30, adn at the tym it was like 11.  Before I left I talked to Christina on the phone. So, I got ready and my dad came adn ate adn then I went with him. It was boring waiting for him at his work, but then finally we left. We went up on the mountains, it was sooo nice up there, U could see all these trees, u could see the ocean, it was soo pretty!!!!!!!!!!Well, we eventually we got to the place that he had the delivery and I waited in that stupid truck for at least and hour and a half, it was soo boring, adn it just kept on getting hotter and hotter. i talked to nathalie on the phone. After that I was still waiting and then my dad made me videotape teh beautiful wilderness. I have it on tape :) After that we drove back to Santa Cruz, it was such a looong drive, there were curves and curves and then there was a whole bunch of traffic!!!!!!! ugh...I was soo tired of sitting down...ooh and before we left we got to felton and bougth some Ice cream at rite-aid, my dad let me get a double scoop, I got Mint chocloate chip and chocolate chip yumm....Ok so, eventually after a long tym we got to Santa Cruz, adn then we got home. I called Nathalie and she was at the mall with Christina. I couldn't go , cuz news came up that I got a new neice and nephew, How EXCITING!!!!!!!!!! ok, before I had to got to the hospital, we went to K-mArt, I was freakin out, cuz I was scared I would run into him, i seriously don't know wat I would do. Anywayz then  We had to go to the hospital. So I couldn't go to the mal :(!!!!! Well , we headed to the hospital, It was @ Dominican, yay, thatz where I was born :) Ok so I met my new nephew, I think they're gonna name him Adrian.  then we went to see my neice, she's the grandchild of my aunt, the one that died.  My cousin is naming her Rosario.  Ok, so I got to meet them...YAY!!!!!!! So then we went to go get something to eat and we went to Taco Bell, and we ate there...it was yummy, I ate 2 tacos. Then we as soon as everyone was finished we headed home and when we were driving over that bridhe by K-Mart, ariana saw someone and then she started tapping on my shoulder adn I turned around, it was him, omg!!!!! well  i think it was him...My heart seriously started beating sooo fast. It migth've not been him, but I think it was. Ok, so then we went to Lounqs to get some necessities. I saw Ashley Sanders there, when I was with my mom, dad, and sisters. She said Hi to me and I said hi back. then she was like How are u, and I was like good and then I asked her how she was and she said good then she asked me how my summer was adn I said good, adn that was it. It was weird though cuz I never talk to her and she was like starting up a conversation...oooh I rememebr when we were like best friends in 2nd grade. LOL!!!!! ANywayz so ya then we went tot he gas station and I called nathalie and then she said she was gonna come over to my house cuz she was at her grandma's.

She was like singing all these songs...ya, I know she didn't make them up, but it was a wonderful performance, we have some of it on tape too....LOL!!!!!!!

Then I went to go watch the Butterfly Affect with my sisters. I LOVE that movie, it was my 2nd tym watching it. Then after that I came into my room adn wrote in my blog and now I'm gonna get off, listen to my CD player to all those wonderful songs that are probly gonna make me cry, adn then around 1:30 Christina's gonna calle me, or at least she better.

Ok, so 2day I woke up around 11ish adn I remembered that Christina was gonna come over sorta earliesh, so I got all pampered hee hee. And, just as I knew, Christina showed up around 12:30. She was here, just chillin. We went to the mall for like half an hour and we baught squeeze pops yumm... then nathalie called me telling me that she saw Cruz at K-Mart, she always sees him, adn I never do :( o well...I was going crazy, cuz he hasn't called me, not like he has the obligation to or anything, but anywayz the good thing is that I had my comfort food, which is the squeeze pop, I finished it in like 3 or 4 hours, ya I know CRAZY!!!!!! Ok, so then we walked back to my house and nathalie adn brandon showed up...the Ouija was actin crzy today. umm...ya and then christina had to leave bcuz she had cheerleading practice. Then me and nathalie had to take brandon to his house and then Henry called us, we were tricking them, making them think that there was gonna be aparty tonigth hee hee&nbsp;LOSERS!!!!!! anywayz we went abck home adn pretty much didn't do much... adn umm... ya just sat around asked the board a couple more&nbsp;questions, even though it didn't answer us well. Then nathalie had to leave and I basically stayed home and didn't do anything.oohh, Chrisitna couldn't spend the night :( Sooo sad!!!!!!!!! well, me and mari stayed up until 1 playin with the Ouija. And then I was awake until 2 listening to music...I cried :( brown Eyes is sooo sad. well I g2g cuz there isn't much more to say about 2day, and if I forgot something then just let me know alright????    **LUV,LIL'C**

        Alright, as u all know, well I think u all know that Christina spent the nigth, so we woke up @ 11, cuz the stupid alarm ugh... then we fell back asleep and then we got a phone call from my mother, asking us if we were still sleeping. And I told her that we have been awake and we were chit chattin, even though we were really still kinda asleep....hee hee. anywayz we were now awake, since there was no way we were gonna be able to go back to sleep, or else we would get bugged by my momma. ok so, we did some more Ouija board, gosh that gets like addicting, well the only reason we played some more bcuz mari came in and she asked it a question. That thing is creepy, cuz it spelled out Cruz's last name, when I asked it if I was gonna see anyone today. It's scary. After we did that, we went back to the house, it was soo bright outside it was hot too. When we got inside we got dressed and then we went to go get something to eat, and it was like 12 something already. We were still eating when I got a phone call from Nathalie around, I dunno...it was after 12:30 though. She wanted to know if she could come over, adn of course she could. Her and Christina are like family, i swear, and I have proof, I;ll tell u in a minute. Ok, so nathalie came when we were just finishin our umm... well brunch I guess hahaha. then we went into my room to do the Ouija...right??? ya I think so. Then we started puting it away when we heard that my mom wasn't sleepin anymore. My mom had to go to work, it was now, a couple of minutes b4 3. I went to go give my mom a kiss goodbye and so did ariana and mari, adn then Christina and Nathalie did 2. SEE we are all a BIG HAPPY family!!!!!!!!!!! umm... ok so once my mom left we went into my grandmas's room and got some candles so the Ouija board would work itz magic. We turned them on and then we started to ask questions, adn it gave us direct answerd. It answered everything perfectly. I asked why cruz hasn't called me adn it said that it was bcuz he is confused. well we all get a whole bunch of answers. Once we turned on the candle, we were seriously having a full on conversation with the board. It answered perfectly, the candles really work!!!!   During our little conversation we were hearing noises outside my room and we heard ppl's voices, we were creepin out! We each grabbed a weapon LOL, I grabbed my hair spray hee hee, it would've probly worked like pepper spray. We walked out of my room, I was the first one and then I looked outside the front door and I saw carlos's car. Then I looked in the living room and it was Carlos and Jonny, it was hilarious cuz we were seriously expecting like a robber. We said hello to them both and then we kept locking ourselves in my room so we could keep on going with the Ouija and then they kept coming at the door. So eventually Nathalie decided to go to the mall so she went with ariana. Christina, Mari and me stayed behind, but then we decided we wanted to go look @ our horoscope At that book store at the mall, so we went. Then when we finished we went to the food court, where we found Nathalie and ariana, they were waiting by Sbarro's for someone by the name of Jose. Then me, christina and mari went to go buy a vanilla Carmel Chiller, yumm.....it was delicious...then we went back adn jose wanted me and Christina to talk to his friends and nathalie was like "no!, they can't, they have boyfriends, Christina, u can't do that to [........] adn Crystal, u can't do that to..cc...cccrr...uuuu....zzzz....eeeeeerrrr!!!!" it was soo funny. To tell u the truth I had no clue wat Jose was telling us. So then we all went to Macys for a lil bit to smell perfumes. then we were gonna go to Gottschalks and then Jose signaled to Christina basically if she knew where nathalie was. So we went to get nathalie and then took her to Jose and then the rest of us decided to go walk around and we walked to ToyTown. We were just walking around looking at all those wonderful toys, not really, they're actually kinda boring. then there was this lady on a walkie takie, she was bugging all of us, cuz she just kept following us around the store and looking at us...ugh I kinda wanted to kill her, well not really, just hurt her really bad.hheee heee ok so then we were really bored so we wanted to go back to my house. So we went back to the food court to look for nathalie, and well... we found her...adn then we headed back home. When we got there carlos adn Jonny were still there. We, I think we did a lil more Ouija. adn then Carlos and Jonny came into my room, don't worry we hid the board. So then they were just there adn we were all conversing...With Jonny, me and christina were talking to him about the player's club adn the thing he was taping... he says he has the tape and ya, we were just talking about stuff. Carlos was talking to Nathalie abotu Geometry stuff, I think...I dunno So ya, then we decided to see wat Henry's house # was, cuz Ouija gave us an address, adn we wanted to see if it was correct. It wasn't correct. Then we came back to my casa and we decided to go outside and hang out so we were sitting there talkign about some more stuff LOL Me and Jonny were talking about Pier 39 in San Francisco. umm... I was also talking to Christina about something, but Jonny interupted with the San fran Pier thing. And Nathalie and mari went inside so ...ya. then Jonny kept chasing ariana becuz ariana got jonny wet, adn Jonny wanted to throw ariana in the pond. Ariana just kept running away, adn then Jonny lost her adn he went inside to go look for her and then he caleld me bcuz he need my help for something. So he told me he needed to go to my room to get his things, but of course I knew that he was looking for ariana. Then they opened the door and there was this war kinda thing cuz he went to go get ariana, but we wouldn't let him. So then Calrlos adn him had to leave. So we told them all good-bye adn they left. We did a lil more Ouija and then Christina's dad came and then soon nathalie's mother came. so everyone was gone. Me, ariana adn mari had to pick up all the wx that fell onto the ground we just cleaned it up and then colored it so the carpet wouldn't look white. After that we went to go eat dinner, it was delish.hee hee then we well just sat around, i went on the computer, listened to music. Oh yah, henry called dn he wantz to hang out.hmm... I doubt it... anywayz I called christina adn talked to her for a while, but then she was gonna go online, so now I'm tlaking to her online and I'm writing in the blog...how fun....I'm soooo tired rigth now, my eyes are like wanting to close.....hmmm.... adn itz only 11. well I'm gonna go now an dtalk to chrisitna, cuz I don't think i have much to say about today, cuz I think I let out everything that happened. GOODBYE!!!!!!!!!!!!  **LUV,LIL'C**  P.s don't forget to leave me a comment Alright???!!!! ok thx.  P.P.S one more thing about the Ouija board, it was trying to tell me that something is gonna happened on August 1, 2004. and it has to do with Cruz.

        OMG!!!! wat a crazy day!!!! well it started of with me waking up like exactly at 10:30 and  then I pampered myself LOL!!!!! I was just spneding my tym pampering until we found out we were  gonna be late to pick up ariana, we (my mom, mari and me)lost track of tym. So when we went to  pick up Ariana we were about 15 min late. she was like about to walk home hee hee. After that I  came back home. O wait, rigth before we went to pick up ariana, nathalie called me and asked me  if I wanted to go watch a movie with her and brandon, cuz it started @ 12:45. I told them I wasn't  sure, cuz I thought I was gonna go to the boardwalk with Gardenia, but I didn't know wat tym. So then  ya, we went to pick up ariana. Then I got home and made a sandwich for my dad's lunch adn then I made  one for myself, when nathalie called me adn asked me if her and brandon could come over, and that I HAD  to go with them to the movies. I asked my mom adn dad adn they said that they could come over. It took  them actually not that long at all for them to get to my house. I was just about to start to eat my  sandwich. nathalie needed to borrow a shirt for when we went to the movies, except we changed plans to  go to the mall instead. I let her borrow my red Albercrombie shirt. And Brandon was just on my computer  chattin to some of his ppl. Then I went to finish my sandwich and wash the dishes. then nathalie kept telling  me I HAD to go, so i went to ask my parentals, adn they said I had to be back before 3 bcuz I had to take  care of the children haha. So we were off to the mall. When we got there we checked to see if Jose was  working and he wasn't, so then we took some pix on that machine thing, They were HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!  After the pix we walked to american Eagle and Christina called me :) I was talking to her for a while...and  then I sat with nathalie at american eagle talking about everything, and I told her about my dream, and then  I said how it was kool that gardenia had a dream dictionary. oooh adn this was when we were in Express.  After that we decided to go see if we could find some dream dictionaries at that one book store. We found  some adn we also found like astrology things, I thought the astrology books were more interesting, I mean  so was the dream dictionaries, I wann buy one of those. After that, I dunno who had the idea, but we decided  we wanted a Ouija board adn I was like "ooh, they sell those @ lounqs. So, we decided that we were gonna go  buy one , but first we had to go pick up ariana and mari, cuz they couldn't be home alone. So we walked to  lounqz, OMG!!!!! we jaywalked sooo many tyms today.  so anywayz me and brandon went o go buy the ouija board while nathalie and the girls went  to buy food @ McDonalds. The darn board cost us like almost $25. Itz soo expensive. So after  that we went into McDonalds to go with Nath and the girls. Then we walked back to my house,  again some more jaywalking. then when we got home , my dad and my uncle were here. So we went  into my room adn turned off the lights, but it wasn't that dark, cuz it was only like 3:30. So  we started to use the Ouija board, it was soo freaky. I thought brandon was moving it. We asked  a couple of questions, if u wanna know any of them, u gotta look in my DB book.  then Brandon had to leave, so then brandon opened my door in my room adn there is always like  a swish of air, when somoene opens my door, so i heard it and screamed a lil bit, adn then  everyone else started screaming and running out of my room, and I was jus tlike "wat r u guyz  doing", but I told this to myself. It was soooo funny. So then nathalie and brandon left, of  course nathalie was gonna come back. So me, ariana and mari just sat around waiting for nathalie.  then she finally came back. And we got out the board again, this was when we asked like sooo  many questions...some questions were answered accurately, some were weird adn some i guess we  just have to figure out wat it means. Like most of mine hee hee. During our Ouija board extravaganza,  I kept trying to call Christina, but it was always busy...it was upsetting, CHristina get your brother  offline. Anywayz so we were kinda creeped out. O yah , adn Cruz doesn't like Tanya, adn he likes me :),   well at least according to the board LOL!!!!! Then nathalie had to leave, so sad :( :( Then, gardenia  called me to go to the boardwalk, but my father didn't let me ugh...he is soo mean!!!!After that me,  ariana and mari did a couple of questions, thatz when I figured out, o wait nevermind that was something  else. The thing that is creepy is that we never move it, it actually moves by itself!!!! So ya, we asked  a couple more questions. adn umm... then well i called Christina adn it finally wasn't busy, adn I talked  to her and she is gonna be coming soon so now I'm listening to music adn just hangin around waiting for  Christina...ok so for now i'll wait and see wat happens when Christina comes and i'll write that down ok  Alright, Christina is now here, she's been here for a lil while, we did the Ouija once again, just to show  her how it works, Ariana asked about her guy, and it said something, Like he will like u I think.It wasn't  so creepy as the first tym At all. WEll actually I was never really freakin out, like ya I thought it was  really weird adn strange how it answered those questions, but I'm not goin crazy bcuz of it. So, nathalie  don't worry, just don't try to be superstitious. Alrigth, well I told Chrisitna everything, so she is caught  up. Well, we are just talking now, adn EXPERIMENTING something...something u don't need to know about. Anywayz  I'm gonna go now,probly to play some more Ouija boardin the back room...ooo....creepy!!!!! well I gots to go  BUH BYE!!!!!!!!!!  **LUV,LIL'C**

        ok, well I wasn't really home all day, but I pretty much was. I woke up around 9, that is too early, I was soo tired cuz last night I fell asleep like @ 1. itz not that late, but still. I had to wake up early bcuz we had to take my grandma to Ben Lomond, she wanted to got keep my aunt company. So, me and mari went with my mom to take her. When we got there we kinda sat at my aunt's house and watched tv, it was this show on the spanish channel, it was pretty interesting. Then we had to go like across the street to my other aunt's house. There we sat around and did nothing, and I got clothes from my cousin, some were cute, some I decided not to keep. haha. So, then we went home, and the whole way I just listened to my cd player. Then we went to pick up Ariana since we got back right in tym to pick her up. SO, we picked her up and then we came home. I talked to Christina and Nathalie online and nathalie gave me a whole bunch of ideas of songs to download. I was talking to Christina about my dream. My dream made me soo mad...ugh...I will not mention wat it was about either. I don't even wanna relive it. I talked to Tina on the phone for a lil bit, nathalie was ont he phone 2. Except I had to go cuz my brother was taking us out to eat, even though he wasn't really, he was really gonna make Ariana and mari pay, cuz I didn't wanna take money out of the bank, bcuz in this past month I already took out too much. So we went to the banck so Ariana and mari could take money out of the bank. There was this weird guy who wanted money from carlos and was trying to give him 3 Armani jackets. Carlso said that they seemed really real, but he didn't know wat that guy had up his sleeve, it was pretty suspicious. He was italian too. I was just thinking wat if we were like on punk'd or something liket hat, that would be sooo funny. LOL!!! umm...then we went to Takara and ordered this huge order of sushi that was like $40. Then we went to buy my mom Jamba Juice adn took it to her work. Then we got home and chowed down on the sushi. It was delicious...I like the eel on and the california rolls, oh and the shrimp one. yumm...After our little chow down I went into my room and hung around at my computer like always. After that I went to play a lil bit of Final Fanatasy, itz this game on the playstation. then I hung around and then carlos left after we ate dinner. then when my mom came to eat dinner there was this phsyco cat outside my house, I SWEAR, my mom like drove the car all close to it and it didn't leave. And then my dad sprayed a whole bunch of water with the hose and it just didn't leave, Wat did he wanT!!!!??? I swear it was crazy!!!!!! Then i talked to Christina for like 15 min, but then someone called her brother so she's gonna call me back. Right now I was thinking of calling u-know-who, but I don't really feel like it, well i do, but I just don't know wat I wanna talk to him about. oooh I had this very interesting conversation with carlos before that one italian guy showed up..this is about how it went:   "I have some stupid friends and crazy stories...do u have any crazy stories??"-Carlos  "uuhh...no...[pause]"-ME   "wat about your friends??"-Carlos  "Which ones?"-ME  "the ones I've met...wat about the cheerleader?"-Carlos  "umm...I dunno..."-Me  "wat about your other friend?"-Carlos  "I dunno"-Me  "the cheerleader seems like she's the crazier one, is she?"-Carlos  "ya, pretty much..."-Me  "your other friend is more mellowed down rigth?"-Carlos  "ya...her name is nathalie.."-Me  "u know I'm not good with names"-Carlos  "ya, watever, soo wat about me, do i seem more mellowed down than nathalie?"-ME  "well, no, especially if your going out with Cruz...you've chanegd in this past year, itz hard to tell, cuz I only know the way u are around the house"-Carlos   I know,I know, I still haven't told carlos about me and Cruz not being together anymore, I just don't know how to tell him, cuz I don't wanna tell him that cruz dumped me, cuz then cruz might have to die. And I don't wanna say i dumped him cuz, well wat if he asks cruz and then cruz says something different. ugh...and then I was talking to one of my obsessors on the phone bcuz he had called ariana and he wanted to talk to me bcuz ariana was saying that she was with her boyfriend adn I had to tell him that it was ariana's boyfriend and then he asked me about my boyfriend adn I was liek I don't have one and carlos was there. And he asked ariana "wat happened to cruz?" And Ariana was like " o,she's only saying that cuz she's talking to that guy" ooop I guess I forgot to tell him...hee heee, don't worry I'll eventually I'll get around to telling him.   Somewhere in the converstaion carlos said something about hoping he doesn't hear about any stories about parties and finds out I've done something stupid...adn of course in my mind i was just like...let's hope u never found out...cuz itz too late LOL!!!!!   Well...Christina, according to Carlos u r the crazier one. Nathalie, u r the more mellowed down one. And I'm the one who had really changed in the past year, who isn't so mellow anymore, like the way i used to be.   Hi Gardenia!!!!!!!!!!! we still need 2 hang out!!!!! I hope you have been having a great summer soo far. I know I'm talking to u rigth now, but I just wanted to say "hi" in my blog heee heee x7!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! omg I was remembering that letter we wrote to ourselves for our senior year, I can already answer some of those questions I asked myself, I'm gonna cry when I get it, I know it....   well I'm gonna go now...Cuz I think i wrote about everything that needed to be said!!!

        2day, when I woke up I got ready, like I do every morning. u know, a little makeover. After that I helped with cleaning the house bcuz we were gonna have family over. I vacummed the whole house and cleaned my room.Ariana's room looks soo cute, no she had a new room, I like it, but mine is still waay better hee hee. After that I took a little nap while listening to music. I love my music, I haev like 118 songs. I love em all. So then, I took a little bike ride with ariana and mari, it was fun, then we saw our cousins. They walked to our house nad they were there for a while and then we started having a barbeque all of a sudden. I called up Nathalie and christina, they both said they were gonna come. So first nathalie showed up adn she was here for a while, she ate a hot dog and then one of those spicy ones, I didn't have one, cuz I think they're too spicy. Then she started downloading some music 4 me LOL...then christina finally showed up. It was fun we sat around, had some DB moments, listened to music and laughed it was great, great tyms. Soon nathalie had to leave :( ooh Christina gave me my squeeze pop, yumm... I seriously like chugged that thing, I'm gonna feel soo sick tomorrow, I'm already startingt to. We need to work on our diets cuz we seriously are gonna get fat,. It seems like we are on a diet to get fat, than to get skinnier. hahaha. So we sat around listened to music, laughed, had moments. It was sooo much fun, but then she left around like 10, i think. it was soo sad :( I LOVE YOU CHristina!!!! hee hee heee. Then I started to watch BadBoys with MAri, and my dad took the cellphone from my room ugh...how can he just walk in my room like that and take the cellphone!!!!Anywayz I watched BadBoys with mari, part of the tym I was tlaking to christina though, cuz I caleld her to tell her that I had no cellphone for the night :( we were talking for quite some tym. But then she had to go.

        2day I had to wake up soo early, I woke up at 7:30, it sucked really bad. I had to take a shower and then get ready for the "surprise" it was only a surprise for ariana and mari, I already knew where we were going. Anywayz so we left around 9:30ish and then we met Liza somewhere past Los Gatos so she could give us our $20 off ticket. Before we got to Great America, my dad freaked me out soo bad. He told me that he was gonna take me to the airport so I could go to mexico bcuz my aunts were waiting for me in mexico. I can't beleive I actually fell for it, I thought he had tricked me into thinking we were going to Great America nad really they were gonna take me to the airport it was scary, but thank god that wasn't the case adn we were going to Great America. So we got to Great America and me adn ariana were soo excited bcuz we love topGun and that was the ride we couldn't wait to get on. Mari was excited cuz it was her first tym going to Great America. This was my 4th tym going. My first tym I went w/ ariana, carlos, jonny, Brandy, and Gabe. That tym it was soo much fun. The 2nd tym, i went with Christina it was fun, except for the fact that we waited in line for Stealth for like 2 hours adn we never even got to go on it. The third tym I went with nathalie thatw as fun 2 adn we went on the water rapids 10 tyms, that was crazy, we were trying to get to 20, but instead we only got to 10, it was really fun. no this tym, was really really fun also. So first me and ariana got in line for Topgun, it was such a long line...but my mom, dad, and mari waited for us. It was fun, when we finally got on. After that we went on this ride called the Orbit, mari was freaking out, cuz she said she was scared of heights LOL!!! umm... then we got on a whoel bunch of rides, long lines, short lines a whole bunch of different ones. We got to go on Invertigo, that was sooo much fun, I love that ride, we also went on Grizzly, Demon. Ooh after that we caught up with my cousins, it was fun cuz they went on all the rides we went on, it was kool. the only ride I didn't go on this tym was Drop Zone. I've been on it twice, but it still freaks me out. I had soo much fun, I LOVE greatamerica, itz the best. We were there from like 10:30 to like 7 or 8. After Great america, we all went to my cousin's house. It was fun, I called nathalie adn I tried calling christina, but she wasn't home. We just hung out @ my cousin's house up in Palo Alto for a while and then we finally left around 10:30ish. We didn't get home until like 11:30. I had a missed call from Christina, so i tried to call her back, but her phone was busy. I had soo much fun.The thing that sucked was that their weren't very many cute guyz nd if there was any, they were all taken hee hee o well...we gotta go shooping somewhere else and next tym w/ Christina since nathalie can't :(  Nathalie and Chrisitna we seriously all have to go to Great America one day all together, u know, a 3DB day wooo!!!!! ok well i g2g now Buh BYE!!!!!!!!!!  **LUV,LIL'C**

        Umm.. who really cares wat tym I wake up, I bet everytime u read this you're saying " who cares" ok, I'm balbbin on... So, anywayz, ya I didn't do much until like 12 when we went to pick up Ariana from summer skool. Then I stayed home and did nothing until christina came to my house around 2:30 ish I think i can't really remember. But I remember her hair was all curled it looked really cute :) She was my inspiration to curl my haie that day LOL!! so i curled my hair and she downloaded a whole ton of songs 4 me THANK YOU CHRISTINA!!!!!!!!! Soo, again we just sat around and chit-chatted and then we went into the kitchen to have a decent conversation, but not their just had to be like 3 phone calls in like 10 minutes. My cousin alex called it was hilarious cuz christina pretended to gove him her # and really gave him Ivan's LOL!!!!! Then we saw that nathalie showed up YAY!!!!!!!! The 3DB's once again!!!! so we decided to go to the mall and to get sundaes, yum....Ariana and mari tagged along once again. We walked to get sundaes and then we walked to the mall and we walked around. We got to the food Court and we saw that Jose was working there so he was about to get off his break, so nathalie separated with im while Christina, Ariana, mari, and I walked to American Eagle, they had really cute tube tops. We tried them on, but they didn't fit well, well At least not on me. OMG and we also saw Jonny hangin out with Jessica Murphy eeew.... ya me and Christina had trouble trying on the clothes at American Eagle Oeww!!!!!!! She ended up buying a cute pink halter top and I think nathalie bought a yellow striped tube top. So after we finished with American Eagle we walked back to my house and just sat around, some more chit-chatting adn then we went to eat dinner. While I was in the bathroom someone called and they tried to make me beleive it was henry, which I knew they were lying about. I knew who it was. so i decided to go to my mom's room phone and just like I knew it was my umm... it was Jose. Anywayz then they hung up and I talked to him for a while. then he called back later adn Christina talked to him adn asked him if he liked a girlnamed Tanya Ortega and he said yes I heard him say it ugh.... then she asked if he liked me adn I didn't listen to wat he said bcuz as soon as I heard him say yes to the other question I hung up the phone. According to Christina he still likes me, but he doesn't think we'll go out again. :( O well... then i talked to him for a while after that and then I talked to him some more on the cell phone and then he said he would call me tomorrow to see if he could go to the mall adn we could hang out, but I also said that I doubted that I would be here. So then Nathalie was the first to leave and then Christina was talking to cruz when her dad came it was funny cuz her dad adn my dad were watching a mexican movie hahaha... but then christina had to leave soo sad :(.... After that I just went to bed adn listened to music I think hee hee

They said they were gonna go visit us l8er. SO n/e wayz, I got home and did nothing, I was sooo bored I had nothing to do and for some reason going to the mall sounded exciting, so I called up Nathalie to see if she would be able to go w/ me to the mall, but she was at her house so I couldn't go w/ her. And b4 I had called nathalie like b4 I went to pick up Ariana I called christina, but she was @ Jackie's house. So after I called nathalie I tried calling christina again, and this tym she was home, so I asked her if she wanted to join us to go to the mall, bcuz I was soo bored and i was in the mood to go. She said ya, and that she would be here in a while. So, we just waited for Christina, oh and we is me, ariana and mari. we just sat around and watched tv. When christina got here I asked my father if we could all go to the mall, and he said no, adn then he said ok adn CHrisitna complimented my dad on his hair, cuz he had died his hair adn then he was happy to let us go the the mall. YAY!!!! so we went and I was really expecting something to happen, cuz earlier I seriously was excited to go, but nothing really happened. It wasn't that great, and then ariana told me and christina that she wanted to take pix at clique, and we were like no, adn she said she would pay and she kept bugging us, so we took pix. They turned out ok. I really wanted my hair down, but nooo, I had to have my hair up in a ponytail :( o well... After we walked around the mall 4 ever we got our pix and then got chillers adn then started walking home adn then my dad picked us up and we went to go get Pizza's @ little Ceasars, we got three boxes adn then we also got crazy bread adn hid it from my cousins lol. SO, we ate our pizzas adn me and christina talked about things again, we always have conversations to talk about and they're always interesting, we never get bored hee hee.

        Alright, 2day i woke up around 10, i think. so, I woke up and basically did nothing for a while. Then Christina called me and invited me to HArvey West Park, for a barbeque, so I asked adn I was able to go. She also called nathalie, but she didn't answer :( so, around 12:30, Christina and her mom picked me up, and then we went back to her house to pick up her brother and dad. After that we got to the park where there was a whole bunch of food. mariah was there too, she is soo adorable. Erica's cousin is soo cute too. So we were there for like, until...I can't remember LOL we were just hangin out in the little park on the teeter totter LOL it was fun. then we ate soo much.We also hung out and talked. Me and chrisitna always have something to talk about. After the park we went back to Christina's house. We were there for a while and we had some more DB moments!!! " NO,Who's gonna take care of my baby??" LOL hahaha!! hilarious, srry for those of u who do not unsertand, u just had to be there, I couldn't even breathe hee hee... so after we had our crazy moments, we decided to go rent a couple of movies, so we went to the video place and finally after soo long,we decided to rent Eurotrip and Bad Santa. I got a lollipop yum...it was cotton candy. Christina got a whole lot of candy. then we started to walk to our wonderful memory area, oh and we saw Jouaquin w/ his little brother. It was funny, but we didn't talk to him. So we got to our wonderful cove and just remembered it was a wonderful moment, nathalie should've been there, but I think she had like other plans. Well then we walked back to christina's house. OOH I forgot to tell u, that well letz forget it. ok, so on our way back we had to go through Del mar school, and there were a whole bunch of mexicans who were gonna play soccer. And of course they started trying to get our attention, they were so retarded. If they like came up to us adn introduced themselves then mebe we would have cared, but they didn't so they were soo stupid. and then we had our lollipops and they were saying "no me vas a dar paleta" which means " Aren't u gonna give me some lollipop?" they were soo dumb. ans under my breath I was just like " u don't deserve any". I seriously thought they were gonna go and try to chase us or something. but they didn't which is good. SO, then we got to Christina's house and we started to watch Eurotrip and then we finished watching it and I called my mother to see if I could stay to watch a movie at christina's house and she said yes so I stayed for movie #2. Of course we didn't start the movie until we got some of christina's famous coffee LOL!!!! Bad santa was hilarious!!!!!!!! Then when it was over I called so i would get picked up and ariana opened the present chrisitna gave her LOL itz funny!! umm... ya, tomorrow I think we're goin runnin. While I was at her house I got a couple missed calls, but I didn't get one from the person I was wishing it would be :( ya, I know I should be over it by now, but I'm not O well !!!! Well, rigth now I'm talkin to tina online itz pretty interesting... Well I gotta go, I doubt I'll fall asleep though, cuz christina said u have to have coffee 5 hours b4 u go to sleep, so If I had it around 7:30, I still have until 12:30 and it is 11:40, so I bet I'll talk to christina on the phone LOL like always well BUH BYE  *~*LUV, LIL'C*~*

So we got home and then reina came and she had cupcakes and face painting things I think. After that Nena came and the rest of them w/ their cousin fonso. Then ariana's friends came, Jessica, carmen and then mybsami, I don't know if thatz how u spell it??!! It was pretty boring at first. Then we started going on the party line thing, itz like a chat room except on the phone, itz pretty interesting. we were on their for like an hour and something minutes. Then we got bored of it, adn then Liza and carlos came. and then just a whole bunch of ppl came it was soo packed, it was like a HUGE party, not one of those simple little birthday parties, but a BIG one. I talked to nathalie on the phone, she saw someone there that I wish I could've seen, he didn't call me :(!!!!!!! that makes me sooo upset. He was in town and he didn't call me!!!!! Anywayz, we had cake, she opened presents, u know the usual thing that happens at birthday parties. After that something happened that usually never occurs at a birthday party, wat happened!???????!!!!!!! ok ok, this guy that I had never met b4, well it turns out he's my nephew, but anyways ya, my nephew threw ariana in the pool w/ clothes and all. She was just thrown in there, it must've sucked bcuz it wasn't really warm. It was sooo hilarious though. HEE HEE HEE u should've been there christina and nathalie, instead I was hangin out w/ Ariana's friends, it was kool though. After ariana was thrown in the pool we hung around and just talked and tried to have fun. nope, still no phone call.:( umm...let me see then some ppl started leaving, then we left, me, ariana, mari adn my cousins. So ariana ( the birthday girl) left watever guests stayed behind LOL!!!!! ya we went w/ them to their apartments and we saw Andy, and some other ppl. Then we walked down to the beach. I called christina but the stupid phone waslow on battery so i couldn't talk to her anymore :(. nope still no phone call. :( we were at the beach for like almost 2 hrs. it was kool a whole lot of smoke and fire. We created a bonfire, it was crazy, it was like the biggest fire on the beach. but then the stupid sheriffs were kicking us out of the beach bcuz they kept telling us to leav, but we wouldn't go, so a whole bunch of their little cars surrounded us and told us to leave. So we left, I really wanted to see...ya u already know who. But I didn't, I hate my stupid day- by-day horoscope, becuz it said I had to smooch him while watching the fireworks, it is soo inaccurate!!!!!!!!!!! After the beach we hung out w/ my nephew LOL his name is Luis, he's pretty kool. he wanted to be in my quincia√±era, like the waltz, but I don't even know if we are gonna have a waltz thing. O well!!!

       Okay, 2day I was woken up around 10 by ariana and mari. They freaked me out!!! They told me that we were gonna go to the Dollar Tree in Watsonville, the only reason I was freaken out was bcuz u know who lives near there right!!?? ok ya well, he didn't call me today and he said he would, o well!! I was really goin crazy when they told me we were gonna go there. Ariana even ran out of my room yelling " mom, Crystal's having a heart attack!!!" haha it was funny. well afterwards I found out we were gonna go to the 99 cent store by K-Mart. I was feelin better, but of course u know part of me wanted to go to Watsonville :) SO after we went shopping for the things for ariana's party we came home and then we looked for yard sales and my mom bought this little bar thing. then Jonny came, and ariana and him were talking about "the past" which was only like 6 months ago when he claimed and all the stupid stuff that happened, so I m guessing he doesn't claim anymore. After that ariana just had to bring it up, she's all "have u talked to Cruz since the last tym?" and then he just said that he never talks to him. Watever.Then Jonny started saying how he was talking w/ carlos and some more of my family about me changing and how "bad" i m starting to get or watever. ugh...that makes me soo mad bcuz they talk about me behind my bak. Jonny says that my mom and dad know about me, u know and cruz, Jonny says that he knows that EVERYONE knows!!!!!!that made me soo mad. Anywayz then we just jung around adn really didn't do anything. Then Liza showed up :) yay, I hadn't seen her for like 2 weeks. Then we went to the mall cuz she had to exchange a santa Cruz sweatshirt that was too big for her. SO me and ariana went to Manx,(which is where we go the sweatshirt) while Liza was w/ Mari and jonny at lady foot locker. So me and ariana went over there and gave her the lady the receipt. then the lady at the store told us she couldn't take the sweatshirt bcuz supposedly we took off a tag or something like that, that was soo stupid bcuz thatz how we bought it. So then we told liza and liza went to Manx to go complain. Liza went in there and told them that we never took anything off and that she lives out of town and that all she wanted was to get a smaller size. Then it got into this long arguing thing. It was soo hilarious. Liza was soo pissed u could tell. then after that they called the manager to see if they could give her a smaller size. so then they said they couldn't take it. then liza was like let me talk to him. SO liza talked to the owner, she was even arguing with the owner. She was like " so, I'm guessing that u check the to see if any of the tags are ripped off when u sell an item" and the owner was like "ya , that is wat we have to do". Then liza was like " well, u know thatz not true, bcuz they didn't check the tags for the ppl who were in front of me in line." ooh that was soo good. The two cashiers just looked at each other like " ooh...S***.It was great!!!!!!LOL PAUSE  ok after this I saw tina, Amy, and brandon it was great, I also saw Jose working at Sbarro's, but I didn't talk to him. oo then we got pretzles yum...After that we went into ross to meet liza, jonny and mari. We saw our aunt and uncle. then we found them. It was pretty boring. Then we decided to go to Manx in Capitola Village. they actually let us exchange it, and u know wat!!!??? The other santa cruz sweatshirts there only had one tag, just like the one we were trying to return. I think liza should go ask for an apology bcuz she was right and they were soooo wrong. So she got a smaller sweatshirt, it was good, then we went to buy some KFC yumm... then we just hung out again. then Nathalie came to my house, jonny was still here. It was kool. Then soon nathalie left :(!!! then I was w/ Jonny in my room, he was helping me find something online, for like G-Unit or something like that. Then we were watching a whole bunch of old school music videos. It was pretty kool. Then Liza came adn we went to take Jonny to watsonville, to Gabe's house. We were pretty lost, I'm not kidding we were wondering around for like half an hour. then we finally found it, but no one was home... we had to wait there for like another half an hour. It was pretty boring.

       2day, I woke up soo early!!!I woke up like @ 8:45. I woke up and then went to mari's Open House thing or something like that, I also saw my admirers. I only think one of them is semi-cute. I think his name is like rafael or something like that. After this wonderful open house thing , ya right, it was the most boring thing EVER!!!!!!!!!! N/E wayz after that, me and my mother went shopping @ the mall for Ariana's present :) She got new shoes!!! and new clothes and a new bathing suit, they are soo cute :) Well after our shopping, we went to pick up the girls, it was great, I said happy birthday to Ariana. :) umm... then I got home and basically waited for the word from Chrstina on our plan hee hee. Christina came to pick me up like right before 3. We went to the career center, it sucked, especially since I m too young!!:( it sux..then we went to the boardwalk to see if we could get jobs, I'm afraid I might not have any luck their either. O well...then I went to christina's house. Christina's brother told us that our little friends were there so we went looking for them at the tracks. We didn't find them. So then we went back to her house and decided to make home made tortillas. We weren't too great since we burnt some tortillas LOL!!! Then we just hung around cuz our little friends showed up. We jsut hung out in Christina's room being bored. And then I guess we decided to jump a whole bunch of fences. It was great, I'm soo proud of myself for being able to jump over the fences :) After that we hung around this factory thing it was pretty boring at first, but then it got a bit more exciting...wow...not like that. it was just not boring cuz we were actually sorta talking. And then we got cold so we went back to Christina's house and everybody decided to show up like her parents. then all our friends left soo sad :( o well. then I ate dinner at christina's house it was bread from my uncle's panaderia. yumm... After we ate we went upstairs adn chatted for a while and then I had to go cuz it was like 9 already. I came home. It was pretty upsetting because me, ariana and mari I guess got in a fight. Ariana was really upset bcuz I left her on her birthday. I felt soo bad, I gave her like 2 huge hugs!!!!!!!! and then afterwards me and ariana talked about our problems and we like bonded and I told her if she ever has problems in life to let me know. I think this bonding thing is great, i'm hoping it will last for a long LONG LONG Tym. wellz i gots to goes.  Bye everybody. And OMG!!!! I'm not gonna see christina for like more than 24 hours, that is sooo gonna suck :(!!!!!!!!!!WEll itz pretty late now, adn I'm waiting for christina's call, she better call me!!!! we always have our midnight talks. well GOODBYE!!!!!!Srry gardenia for not calling u back. I didn't have my cell phone w/ me all day, so I didn't know who called, but by the tym that I got home it was like 9:30 and I didn't know where the cell hone was, cuz my sisters had lost it, so I just found it like 20 min ago, and rigth now it is 12:05. So, I'm soo sorry!!! YAY Christina just called me :)!!!YAY I have to go now!!!!!!!BYE!!!!!!!!!  *~* LUV LIL'C*~*

But itz ok, cuz I'm feeling better. n/e wayz after I woke up I took a shower and ate breakfast, then I got ready to go to the career center w/ christina. But, Christina's car broke down and she couldn't come, cuz she had to take the bus home. :( I didn't see christina at all, it sux, itz been more than 24 hours.

        Alrigth, 2day I was awoken by Mari, she was telling me that if I didn't wake up then I wouldn't go swimming with her and Liza, I ddin't really feel like swimming, but I wasn't in the mood to be alone either. ugh...u know wat!!?? I'm just a freakin wall to ariana and mari, cuz yesterday when ariana was gonna leave mari was like " aww...Ariana's gonna leave me all alone!!"  and then ariana comes to talk to me l8er and she was like "I feel bad, I'm gonna leave mari all alone" ok wat does that makes me, ya u got it a    WALL      that made me soo uuh...mad I guess. Geez itz just as if they were jsut talk to a wall, cuz they were talking to me, yet they were saying mari was gonna be alone, that very nice. Anywayz ok, so we got ready to go swimming and they didn't let me take a shower b4 we went swimming, o well. So then we went to Simpkins, but only the pool for kids under 6 years old were open, so we couldn't go in...ugh...so then we decied to go eat breakfast and then go swimming so we went to .....I forget wat itz called, but itz like right by the fleamarket, it was yummy....So then Carlos came to meet us there and we were with him and then I sadi Hi to Liza's mom. And then We deceided to go to the flea market, so we went. ugh....It was kinda scary, cuz we went to the bathroom there, adn then Liza and Mari walked off together and I stayed behind. So while I was entering the fleamarket all these guyz that were wearing  red , which are the ppl that work there, well one of them was like  "No te vayan a robar"  and then I heard this other one say  "ay, ya se la quieren comer"  gosh those ppl were crazy, I just walked rigth past them and it was kinda a long walk to finally get to liza, mari and Carlos. Geez....I told them never to leave me behind again. LOL!!!! itz funny though, now that I think about it. Well then we walked around the flea market, it was soo  HOT!!!  I was like burning and me adn mari just jept on complaining cuz we wanted to go swimming, so we finally left and we went to Simpkins, it was now open, cuz it was like past 1. So we went and we just started swimming around, it was actually pretty fun, but then I started getting over it. So me and Liza got out of the pool and layed out in the sun, it was nice then we decided to go cuz we had to say goodbye to Carlos b4 he went to work. So we headed back home and sadi goodbye to him then took a shower then....then afterwards my dad came and we had to go to the mall. Well liza had to go to buy some contacts, but it turns out she couldn't buy them. then we went into macy*s and looked at the shoes, there were some cute ones. Then we started heading back and mari bought us a   Vanilla Carmel Chiller   mm...that one is the  BEST!!  well after that we headed back home and then when we got home we just sat on the couch, I sat there listening to my Depression Cd while I was looking throught the new  Teen People  magazine it was fun, well after I looked throught the whole magazine I just laid on the couch lisstening to the Cd, then I fell asleep for like 10 minutes, it was a nice sleep, I think! LOL.. well, earlier we had been planning to go to the Drive-In. so then   Collateral   started at 8:30, so we headed to that, we went with my dad and liza and me and Mari. It was an ok movie, it wasn't that great. Well,  after that movie was over, which was like 10 something we were gonna watch another movie, so we did and this movie started at 10:55. the movie was    Bourne Supremacy,    I liked that movie, it was really good, there were some parts that were soo funny, well at least to mee hee hee and then there were parts where u kinda knew wat was gonna happen. Well it was really good. That movie was over around umm...1ish. So after that we went home and I said goodnight to everyone and I went into my room. And ugh...put on my Depression Cd adn cried haha...again??!!! yup!!! I know i'm such a weirdo, but see crying at ngith refreshes me fot the next day. So ya, I cried and I realized that I really missed him and well...ya I missed him and then I was listening to   Unbreak my Heart   ugh...I dunno why, but for some reason this song seriously made me break down, that I even turned off the Cd Player and put it away, ok this means there was no more musci adn I was still crying...ya, I know, really weird. Ok well then I eventually fell asleep around almost 2. OK well I'm gonna go **CHOW**

Who cares!!?? ok, so After doin my bed and semi cleaning my room, Nathalie called me telling me that she was at her grandmas house. She was telling me that she was bored and then she asked if she could come over. Well   OF COURSE   she could come over, gosh, nathalie u don't even gotta ask. Well so she said she would be here in like 10 minutes. SI did my make-up and semi finished cleaning the rest of my room. ya, and she came and she read my poems and we went on the computer for a while. Basically we were just hangin around in my room until like 3 cuz she had to go to the dentist. So I was basically just umm...well looking for words that rhyme with other words, that way whenever I wanna write a poem, I'll already have words that rhyme. SO I was doin that until Nathalie came, whcih was around well...B4 four!!! then I called my father and asked him if we could go to the mall and he said   "YES"   , yay....well then we were off. We walked to the mall, well first we went to the bank, cuz I needed some dinero. So I got only 10 dollars. Then we went into the food court and we saw   Alicia Martinez    she asked if we had money adn well we only had money to eat, so we said no. then me and Nathalie bought some bar-B-Q chicken...it was yummy....Then we took pix at that machine, gosh, it was crazy!!!! We were     RETARDED!!!!!       I mean it too. I was like yelling it, of course I was probly too mebarassing hee hee was I???!! I dunno....well we took 6 dollars worth of pictures it was kool. Some I liked some I didn't, but watever. They were cute anywayz and we had fun taking them. hee hee hee. Well we also made a wish with the    Romantic Wish     pefume, I can't tell u wat I wished for though, cuz then it wont come true. We just dropped the paper of teh perfume in the fountain, well we kinda slid it into the fountain and then kinda just ran hee hee...it was soo funny. Well then umm...ya thatz when we went to take the pix, I think. We also went to Gottschalks and Mervyns?? ya we did, I think, ya I'm pretty sure. Then Nathalie wasn't feeling good, so we went into the bookstore and then Ariana and Mari were gonna buy a ducky so we waited, but they took too freakin long, so we went to pick them up hee hee...then we found that they were still in the Panache place, they were spinnning that thing. And then we finally started walking to my house YAY!!! well I thought some guyz were htting on my sisters, but then when we got closer, I noticed that no one was hitting on my sisters, It was my cousin. So I said Hi!! and there were these other kids in teh car, ones name is Andy and I dunno the other guys name, but I know he goes to Harbor and I was talking to him on the Fourth of July and I think he hung out with Jonny, I'm not sure. Anywayz who cares. then we were walking to go to Baskin Robins and my sisters separated from us.

            Alright 2day I woke up around 10:30 and took a shower, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth....u know, my usual daily routine. After my daily rountine, I was sitting on my computer, just listening to music and reading my horoscope.  hmm...I felt really lazy again, so I decided to vaccumm the whole house once again, I do that like evry day now!!! lol, well, I vaccummed and then I tried cleaning the kitchen , but it was pretty much already clean. So, once again I sat on the computer, while my mom was takin a nap. So ya, I just sat there, being the lazy little me that I am. Well as soon as my mom was done with her nap, she walked into my room and asked me if I wanted to go to the Ross downtown?? and I was like   "SURE!!".   So we went to look for the girls and see if they wanted to join and they did, so we all kinda sat outside with my grandma before we left. It w as pretty relaxing. We just sat outside in the warm sun...gosh I wanna do that again, all my hurt and pain was like gone...wow I didn't realize how relaxing that was until just now...well ya, it was great. So then after our relaxing moment we drove to the Ross downtown , that one always has way better clothes than the one by the mall. So, as soon as we got there I went straight to the Junior section. I looked through the shirts and skirts and pants. I hardly ever find good shirts there, well sometyms I do, but 2day wasn't the day. I only found one shirt, itz really cute though, so i grabbed that one to try it on. Then I looked throught the pants, and well I didn't find any there that I liked. Then I loked throught the skirts and I found like 4 skirts and a pair of shorts. When I went to try the clothes on. I   hated   the shorts. One of the skirts were too big. So I got three skirts and that black shirt. The skirts I bought were: one was like a   tan   colored one that is kinda like ruffly. the 2nd skirt was like a whitish one and the 3rd one is like a striped one that is like pink and white and black, itz a skort. i think they were soo cute. Well ya, my mom bought them for moi!! and Ariana and Mari bought these twin skirts, they were soo cute, itz like a black background with like pink flowers kinda, itz soo cute. Well after Ross, we went to the PetSmart, it was pretty boring...then we left around 5ish. We were all in the mood for Spaghetti, so we went to Live Oak Market and bought all the neccessities to make Spaghetti. Then when we were about to go home, we saw my dad coming in his car to the live Oak market too. So we talked to him and he said that he was gonna buy carne asada, so we decided to have BAr-B-Q instead of Spaghetti. So, my mom and dad went to buy the Carne Asada while us girl stayed in the car lsitening to Kdon,I can't remember wat we were talking about, but I tihnk it was pretty interesting, we also were eating umm...beef Jerky, it was yummy, especially since i was soo hungry.Well then we drove back gome as soon as they stopped their shopping. We got home like @ 6. Well then I went on the computer and me and Ariana were looking for our horoscope. My horoscope for umm..lemme check really quick......ok I'm back, my horoscope for alloy said :    "You and your mom aren't seeing eye to eye lately, Scorpy, and you feel really bad about it. It's about time that the two of you sit down and talk about it. Ask her what she's doing after work tomorrow. Making plans with your mom is cool!"     this really scares me, does this mean that I should tell my mom about, well....everything??? I need help, well whoever is reading this, can u plz leave me a comment lettin me know wat u think I should do??? THX!!!!!    well ya, some more of my horoscope was well one of the Village ones, the Daily Single's love was :    "Today would be a good day to start a physical routine. Not that you need it, especially, but it'd be great for your mental health. It'd be an excellent way to get your mind off you-know-who."      well, this kinda makes sense, because well it doesn't work for today, but it works for yesterday. Because yesterday I ran for 10 minutes and well while I was running I tried to get my mind off of u-know-who, but well maybe it doesn't make sense, I dunno...well ya, after we finished looking through our horoscope we went outside to eat our dinner. then we finished and I came back inside back online ugh....I'm soo lazy. well ya, I didn the same thing I always do adn then I put myself to read Brandon's blog, GOSH!!!! that took forever!!!!!!!! it was very funny though. After readin it I was like ready to fall asleep. But then I wrote in my blog so ya....I was talking to him online and then I tlaked to nathalie and ya...o wait I also went to    Hollywood    noo....not that hollywood, I went to hollywood vidoe. We rented     HellBoy.     ya, then I came back on the computer and ya, well that was like absically my day.

        2day I woke up @ 11. I got dressed and went into the kitchen adn saw that my grandma was back from wherever she went. Then I said hello to my mom's best friend, named martha. Well then I ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, washed my face, cleaned my rom and then I put make up on cuz I looked soo dead. I even woke up with bags. ugh...it was horrible. I was soo sore, my legs were hurting, but u know wat I was still soo happy that I got my shirt signed. Well then I didn't do much, but went online and looked at a picture of me and Nathalie on Kdon. It was really kool, so I called Nathalie and told her about it, adn she told me that she saw Lil Rob over at Great America, cuz she was over there when I called her. She said that she even took a picture with him, how kool!!!!! She's like surrounded by luck!!! Then we were talking for a while and then we got off the phone. then My mom left @ 3. And I was just sitting at the computer adn then I decided u know wat?? wat is the point of this, so I got up and decied to vaccumm the house with the radio blasting in my mom's room. Can u beleive how bored I was, well i vaccummed the whole house and then I decided to clean up the house, so i fixed little things that were buggin me. So after that I decided I looked too fat, so I did some stretches and then I ran in my backyard for ten minutes again. I tried getting my mind off of the fact that I still had watever minutes left, so then my mind was focused on thinkin about past memories and that made me soo upset, I even noticed I started running faster evertym I thought about the memories I loved and missed. I miss those memories soo much. Itz just like this movie playin over and over in my head. I seriously need to see him. well after I finished runnong my 10 minutes, I went inside and I was sweating like crazy, I grabbed some ice , it felt soo good on my face, then I saw that carlos was here, so I told ariana and mari. We said Hi to carlos and then I sat outside with carlos talking to him about a whole bunch of crazy things like his theories and stuff. There was this one thing he said , he was like describing himself, kinda and when he was describing himself, wat he sadi about himself, seriously reminded me of cruz. I was like wow, u and cruz have someting in common, except I said that in my head LOL!!! haha I bet u though I actually told him that. Well anywayz ya, It was an interesting conversation. Then Christina called YAY!!!! I talked to her for a while and that was an interesting conversation too...well then I had to go to the store, I think, if I remember clearly, so I told her i would call her back l8er. So then we went to the store to get bread with carlos. I think I had another conversation with carlos, can't remember. then Carlos left. After that I ate dinner. Then I had to go to the store to buy some milk, so Ariana and mari came with me. adn we bougth the milk adn walked back home. then I went into my room and went online and wrote in my blog and that was about it for the day. Ooh and I called Christina back, but the phone was off. I also talked to Nathalie online for a while. Well I g2g , soo buh bnye and leave a comment ta-ta!!!!!!!!!!

              ok, well this day started off with the sound of my alarm clock goin off!!! ugh...I was soo tired, it rang at 7:45. So, I got up and took a shower, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, washed my face, dried my hair, fixed my hair and then just got ready. As soon as Nathalie and Chrisitna got here, we pretty much left. I said   "goodbye"   to my familia!!  We left and we got on the freeway, to go to the    LATINO HEAT  .  We passed by Watsonville to drop off Nathalie's brother. then we went back on the the freeway, but rigth before we did, I though I might've seen cruz, but I'm not sure. Well after that, we were on the road for about 41 minutes. When we finally got there, there was like no line. They kept sending the ppl that ought their tickets online to different lines, so when all the ppl that had gotten there like 5 minutes b4 they opened up the gates, almost went in, we were like last even though we were there b4 anyone else. They're soo unorganized.
