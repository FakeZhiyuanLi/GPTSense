						   I am currently away.&nbsp; By away I mean not at the computer at which I am typing this message.&nbsp; Away.&nbsp; This word could be taken as meaning non-existent.&nbsp; Truthfully something cannot be non-existent because it is in fact something.&nbsp; If it were non-existent then it would be nothing and something cannot become nothing.&nbsp; The physical properties or substance of something can in fact change but to go from being to not being is impossible.&nbsp; Something may no longer act the same or may even change its form yet it still is.&nbsp; Some scientists claim that the universe is extending into nothing.&nbsp; How can this be since nothing is not something it is in fact no thing.&nbsp; Nothing is not being it is lack of being, a gap in being if you will.&nbsp; Well, if you have an emergency call me.&nbsp; Hopefully if there is an emergency you have contacted me prior to reading this.

						   1. Do you like your name? Why or why not?&nbsp;Yes, i like my middle name, no i hate my first name... I like my middle name, b/c it's like a royal name, and you don't really hear it every day, plus i love the person i'm named after (Lorraine) and i hate my first name.. It's way to common, doesn't fit my personality, i hate the person I'm named after, and&nbsp;it's generally a really religous name, and i don't like that.&nbsp; (Catherine)  2. If you could change the spelling of your name, would you? And what might you change it to?&nbsp;ummm, i would deff not change Lorraine, BUT i might change catherine, deff. not to a "K" spelling, b/c&nbsp;that's&nbsp;Katies way, and that&nbsp;wa how you told us apart.. but it could be Cathryn.. that's&nbsp;better!  3. If you could change your whole name, what would you change it to?&nbsp;I'd jus put my middle name first... or go by mymiddle name.&nbsp;  4. What girls' name do you like?&nbsp;Teresa (called Tess*) Elizabeth (called Betsy) Deanna, Micaela, and Lorraine.  5. What boys' name do you like?&nbsp;Alexander (called Alec*)&nbsp;Michael, Robert (NO NICKNAMES), James, Trent, Rhett, Micah... and a lot more...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** For those literate ones who read this, those names HAVE NOTHING to do w/  Tess of the D'Urbervilles , i liked them way b4 i read it!
