        hey guys what ya up to not too much here jus got back from the vet and cleaning the church and paying bills with my mom on our way to do all that we went past the red cross and my youth group from church was there washing cars. and i called my best friend michael and told him that if someone would have told me that they were doin that i might have come and he said well when he got there that was the first thing he did was ask did anyone call tabitha and let her know and he said well since yall didn't you must not want her to be a part of the youth group then and ya know that kinda hurts my feelings but i don't let them know that cuz they (as in adults i should say) already think i am a drama queen cuz alot of stuff happened to me this year and i hope that this doesn't happen again. but you would think that your own youth group would have at least called you and let you know that they were having a car wash but they are goin on some ski trip and i know im not gonna get to go on that cuz my mom really don't want me to go without her so im not goin on that for sure but i guess i need to get back into the church and start making everyone like me like i used to do i guess that is the only way everything is gonna get back to normal ill jus have to start goin to youth group and goin back to church on wednesday nights... but i have to go now so ill talk to you later buh bye

        hi...well today i really didn't do anything me and my dad slept half of the day b/c we are both sick. Last saturday i was in the hospital that did blood cultures and a ct and a spinal tap that thought i had somethin that would kill me well then come to find out i have a really serious sinus infection and i am takin 5 prescriptions for it and im gettin better slowly but surely i appreciate everyone that called and checked on me.. i was suppose to be at my best friends lake house having fun when all this took place. i had to call my mom at 4:30 in the morning friday to come get me i got so sick. so i guess i need to call her and see when i can come back up there with before school starts back.  im kinda ready for school to start then im kinda not i mean i want to go back so i can see all my friends and talk to everyone and all but then i don't want to go back because i have to get used to the work and the schedule which really sux. but i guess it will all work out in the end and i have made my mind up that i am gonna try to be more nice to people this year cuz i don't like bein mean and i want to change my ways this year and see how it goes if it goes well i might stay like that but if it doesn't work out ill jus go back to bein the old me the one that complains about everything. lol... but anyways i guess i will let you go now sorry i kept you so long i jus had a lot to get out in the open with everyone. g2g love always tabitha
