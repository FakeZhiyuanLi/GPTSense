      Whenever I take a look at the amount of homework given to us by my teachers, I'll just literally faint and collaspe. I just do not have any idea how to complete it. Well I guess this is where perseverance and determination come in. One has to have those attributes. Surprise! Surprise! I went for a science seminar yesterday. Undoubtedly, it is very interesting. Stem cells, dolly, embryotic stem cells. Just think about that. Cool. Finally, Dr. Alan Colman, our speaker is a big fan of Manchester United! Y0z, Y0z! Brian, you there. I say y0z. Y0z! Y0z!

      It's nothing much today. But at least I completed something that I'm proud of. I've managed to finish the Da Vinci Code. It's a fantastic book but I have to say it contradicts Christanity. Notably and claimed as a free thinker but in a way a christian I was quite surpriesed and irked by the way this book depicted Christ and about the Holy Grail. Who knows whether it is true or not but I being christian, I'm quite against this ideology that Christ was not divine but just pure human. But then this book certainly could cliam its righteous position of #1 International Best Seller for its great contenta nd suspense. A thumbs up for it. Religiously, it's different.

      Mon resultat n'est pas bien. A la vacance, je ne suis pas heureuse et maman gronde moi. Mon reultat n'est pas bien parce que je n'a étudie pas. A la vacance, je prend etudier, lire mais regarder des films. Ne pas regarder "Harry Potter", "Day After Tomorrow>". Lire, lire, maman parle moi. Mon resultat n'est pas bien.   Au revoir et bon nuit.

      I know that I have not updated this site for quite some time but I have got to admit that I am pretty sick of camps. I had two consecutive camps. That is horrible. Think about it. Camp camps camps. One camp we woke up at 1.00 a.m. and did solo night. After that, we had to do 1500 push-ups. The other camp, we were sleeping on the ground which was covered with rocks and stones. Sandflies and mosquitoes constantly harassed us. When we were sleeping, that irritating sound of mosquitoes is unbearable. I'm glad that all camps are over. Starting a new blog. Will see it soon.

      Death. It occurs naturally to all humans, to all living things. It is a natural phenomenon so why should we be afraid of it. Recently, people have been more and more afraid of death, trying all ways to stop and halt death. Why? Because people fear death. They fear it.   	It is  very noticeable that the more civilized and developed society and country is, their people gradually grow more and more frightened of death. They cannot accept death. They think death as negative and should be avoided which is of course, sadly to them, not possible. On the other hand, people from villages or not so developed societies or comm00000; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 11px; -->                                    * Profile *      Name: Yiling  Age: 14   School: Anderson Secondary  Birthday: 1 May 1990   Etc, etc, etc... write anything you want.     * Links *     urlLink Link     urlLink Link     urlLink Link     urlLink Link     urlLink Link     urlLink Anime Skies        * Tagboard *    Have a tagboard here or anything you want.
