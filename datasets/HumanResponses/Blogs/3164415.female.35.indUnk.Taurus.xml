						   I love long weekends! Don't get me wrong, I love my job, but who doesn't like a long weekend!
After spending a few days away from the computer, I have come to the conclusion that this is a very theraputic release.
New item in my life: my husband has been diagnosed with diabetes. This has become very important in my life because the changes I wanted to make for myself are now the changes we both need. You see, in a few months, I am going to have gastric bypass surgery. This is obviously a life altering commitment and the eating changes were important to have under control before the surgery.
We have 30 days to put my husband's diabetes under control with diet and exercise. The whole family had already joined the gym over a month ago. This takes care of exercise, diet just seems to fall into place.
In regards to my biological mother, it was brought to my attention that I may be having some food issues in regards to her and my sense of "abandonment" from being rejected by her. Maybe. This is one issue that I am still trying to understand. Again, this is why I am using this website. I get to vent for anyone to read, and accept comments from anyone who wants to post.
*This note is for Bev: If you really want to help me through this, call me at work (you know where I work) and set up a time and place we can meet and talk uninterupted. I want to be able to get through this and get some mutual understanding.

In general, I have to say that my life is good and I am happy. 

Until my next post...goodnight.

						   OK, here is my basic info.
I am currently 35 years old and I am an adoptee.
I am married (second marriage) and I have two sons from my first marriage. More kids? NO! I love the two I have but am quite happy they are self sufficient.
I was raised as an only child by two very loving, but very strict catholic parents. I was a spoiled rotten kid (this may sound great, but never appreciating anything can cause issues later in life).
About 10 years ago, my biological mother and I found each other. She was wonderful and did not seem to want more than a friendship (this was even more than I hoped for!). Things were great for a while and she helped me understand that emotions and depression are real. With this knowledge, I realized my suicidal thoughts were not normal! Wow! Glad I found that out in time!
I went through some personal issues but kept her in my life. I survived cancer and an amicable divorce. 
While I was going through this, my biological mother chose to pick this time to abandon me yet again by saying she needed some "time". This has to be the ultimate devistation.
As an overweight girl and now overweight woman, I have never been strong in the self-esteem department. This led to many more years of wondering what I did wrong to make her leave.
After two years of professional therapy, I can almost feel very angry with her. Please understand that after 24 years of loving a woman I never even met (for having the courage to give up a child), it is very hard to give up this unconditional love.
I will be using this site to try and work through my issues because here I can type and not be judged (but please feel free to leave a comment, positive or negative).

						   Today I volunteered for the cancer survivors day at Concord Hospital. It is a great cause with alot of work and effort put into it. Unfortunately, the weather was not condusive to a great turnout. We had showers off and on and it was rather cool for a June day.
This weekend was just for me in my mind. Knowing I was going to be at the cancer survivors day, I was thinking about the length of time I have been a survivor. This month I am now nine years cancer free. Hooray for me! And a big congrats goes out to the wonderful people that came out today to celebrate themselves. Let's face it, they deserve it. 
My new personal goal, in one year I would like to be working for the cancer center (or at least working toward a position through college courses).
Goals for the next year:
*complete requirements for surgery
*have the surgery
*increase gym time
*research positions at cancer center
*persue knowledge required for positions through local college


Short terms goals: *what are we going to do this weekend?

Well, I think I am about ready for bed. This has been too much thinking for a Sunday night (haha).

						   It is Saturday and I am at work. Life? I don't think so. 
Anyway, I have decided its time to grow up and get a career instead of just a job. My boys are older (and so am I!) and I need time for ME! Selfish? YES! I am entitled. 
Change 1: I have an intake appointment at a local college in a couple of weeks. 
Change 2: I have decided which career path I would like to take and obtained the advise of someone in the field to guide me in my college choices. 
Change 3: Applied for an entry level position in the career of choice. 

My initial class choices will be in the communications field and liberal arts. 

I will have to get back to this later. My co-worker is all set and no longer needs my guidance. I can go home! 

For now...goodbye!
