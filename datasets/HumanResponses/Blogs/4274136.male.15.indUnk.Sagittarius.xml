       wtf school registration is lame. all these stamps on my hands? a fucking bicycle... gg anyways im taking a bunch of classes that are going to kick my ass, but my laziness is going to kick my ass harder. Wow, that hill over the railroad tracks is a bitch. I havn't biked in forever. I'm getting so lazy. I don't know why I am typing with perfect punctuation, but I am. OMG WTF.... Wow. G_G. My nose just started bleeding like a mother fucker all over my white ass shirt. I hate this dry weather. I can't stand the west coast. The second I turn 18, I'm outta here.  Back to the sweet humidity of the east coast. I can't even begin to describe how much I hate this place. I wish I knew what I'm going to do for college too... Physic is boss, and so is Japanese... but I just don't know anymore. Boredom eats my brain like I eat breadsticks. I can't think straight about anything. I'm so lost. Computer games are boring too. I just sit here all day clicking my life away like it's going to keep me happy. But it's just as boring as anything else.  Not that all this complaining is going to help either.   -The Italian
