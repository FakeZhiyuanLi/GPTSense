      The most precious gift in life is our health.  When my well-being began to decline last year, I began to realize how valuable great health is.   Recently, I came across some startling national statistics on where our health is heading.  120 million individuals have chronic degenerative conditions—no cures  50+ million have Autoimmune conditions— no cures  7 million children are on Ritalin or other psychotropic medications  Prescription drugs #4 cause of death  Six out of the top ten causes of death are diet related  Americans are #1 in world of being overweight  Every disease category is increasing— not decreasing   Pretty scary! Unfortunately the list goes on.  In looking for alternative ways to prevent disease from taking over my body, I discovered recent medical and nutritional research in the study of glyconutrients or by the nickname, “Super Carbs”!  Before you get alarmed about the word “carb”, rest assured that these carbohydrates are in a whole other category. These are a very special type of carbohydrates, not the kind of carbs that most of us are busy avoiding so we can keep from putting on fat by raising our insulin levels!  What really caught my attention is that within weeks after taking these Super Carbs, I noticed that my chronic back pain was disappearing and I experienced an energizing life force returning!  I decided I wanted to learn more about why these products worked so well.  What I found was astounding.  When the body is having a health challenge, it is because there are certain essential nutrients that are missing.  When too much stress, aging, and living in a toxic environment overwhelms the body, it begins to break down.  If you give the body back what is missing, it has the capacity to heal itself!  Would you like to know more?  I will do my best to keep it simple.  These super carbs give the body what it needs to maintain optimal health.  In over 20,000 research articles, these eight super carbs are identified to build glycoproteins, which are crucial for normal cell structure, function, protection, and cell-to-cell communication.  Further research in 1996 revealed at least 6 of the eight super carbs were missing from our diets.  Some of the functions of super carbs are:  Control the immune defense systems identification and communication network that protects the body   Makes us 80-90% of the cells structures  Makes up the mucous creations that protect the stomach and intestines Makes up transport molecules for vitamins, minerals, and lipids  Control cell membrane permeability, regulating what minerals, lipids and other nutrients get inside the cell.  Control the ability of many hormones  Critical for the cell-to-cell communications of all 100+ trillion cells that allows the body as a whole to function normally  Make up many enzymes  Critical for both normal brain structure and brain chemistry function  Make up clotting factors in the Blood  Even determining you're A, B, or O blood type by a single Super Carb   Wow, this can be so confusing if you aren't a doctor or a scientist.  To make it simple, what we put in our body is critical to the quality of our lives.  We MUST have the right fuel for our body to do its job to defend us from disease and keep us youthful, vibrant and energized.  The research is teaching us that we need these eight super carbs that are largely missing from our diets in order for us to maintain normal function and to fight off aging and disease.  When you give your body these missing nutrients, it’s like putting a higher grade of oil in your car because you are concerned and want the maximum performance out of your engine. Are you taking as good care of your body as you do your car?  You can expect much greater performance out of your body when it is correctly fueled!    It's really pretty easy.  If you are the kind of person who isn't willing to settle for half a tank of energy when you could have a full tank, then you are a perfect candidate to begin adding these essential nutrients back into your body with super carbs known as glyconutrients.  This new medical research is called the science of glycobiology or carbohydrate technology.  Remember, these are not ordinary carbohydrates.  They are safe for diabetics and will not cause you to store fat.  Just the opposite!  They allow the body to regulate itself and the way you burn fat and metabolize other foods.  They allow the immune system to balance out properly so you are protected from viruses, bacteria and cancers. They prevent the body from attacking itself in autoimmune disorders.  They have ability to allow the body to heal and regenerate itself.  These essential nutrients make up the life code of the body.  Do you know anyone who would like this kind of protection from disease who would like to give his or her body a chance to restore itself?    If you would like learn more, send us an email to  contact@rejuvenate-your-life.com  and we will send a direct link so you can get more information so you can make an intelligent decision and take control of your health.  Diseases are not from drug deficiencies.  They are from nutritional deficiencies!  Give your body back what is missing and your cells will dance for joy!  Your body knows what to do.  It's up to you to provide it with what it needs!
