      Canada's Premiers met today to discuss with the Federal government how to disseminate and spend Health Care dollars.   These dollars are much needed in an obviously taxed national health care system.   Much to the Federal government's chagrin, it seems that self-serving provincial premiers are trying to dictate how the money should be spent.&nbsp;   Frankly, there's a lot of humour in this don't you think?&nbsp; Dalton McGuinty, friend of all Ontarians, wants Ottawa to stay out of his way while he fixes health care.&nbsp; Well Dalton, ol' buddy ol' pal, I think you want to the money to actually pay for ALL of the improvements to our health care system.&nbsp; Hopefully if you come back with a big bone in tow, you'll actually be able to shorten some of those waiting lists you promised when you slapped us with a new health tax.&nbsp; Skimming from the cookie jar no doubt, the Ontario NPD have already been suggesting that funds from that tax are being applied to other government costs.&nbsp; Like&nbsp;a shell game with tax payer dollars.&nbsp; Or better yet, it's an illusion.&nbsp; Increase taxes, let the Feds pay for better health care and HE will take credit.   You may have also heard about the new user fees and toll roads from which Dalton and his team want to build a better infrastructure.&nbsp; Don't count on it.&nbsp; If you watch Dalton's history it's quite simple.&nbsp;   Step 1:&nbsp; Float an idea people really hate.  Step 2:&nbsp; Blame somebody else for creating the problem  Step 3:&nbsp; Implement an idea what people hate less than idea suggested in #1  Step 4:&nbsp; Sigh of relief when Ontarian are thankful that it wasn't as bad as it could have been.   Don't they use that those types of skills in 1984?&nbsp; Double-Think or something like that?   I guess we truly do get the government we deserve!

      Well it looks like the Liberal government of Canada wants to decriminilize pot again.  Do you think Paul Martin, Prime Minister of this great country of Canada is concerned about smoking pot?   Frankly, I don't.   I don't know much about politics but something tells me that this is a threat to the other parties (in which he shares his minority government) that they better play nice.&nbsp; The Conservatives can't support decriminaliztion of pot, however, they can also not afford to have government dissolve.   So, looks like Paul Martin's new slogan should be, when the going gets tough, the tough, the tough threaten to commit suicide.&nbsp; Silly thing is, it just may work.&nbsp; Any time the Conservatives won't play nice with Martin he just needs to show his "dope card" and threaten to play it.&nbsp; Parliament will dissolve and, low and behold, Canadians are in the throws of a new election with Martin hoping the Conservatives won't be able to win yet again.   And, surprise surprise, government will dissolve on a social issue.&nbsp; Something the conservatives don't have a good track record with.   Smart people in the Martin camp.&nbsp; Let's just hope they pay as much attention to running the country as they do in trying to win the next election.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Mornings are pretty normal similar and sort of blend into each other. First off, my wife gets up, what seems like, several hours before me to the sound of the alarm.  Then, at around 6:45 she and Sebastian (a.k.a. Fat Cat) come and wake me with a pat on the leg and a meow.&nbsp; Sometimes they interchange roles and Sebastian will touch my leg and my Wife will Meow but that's rare and is usually fixed with an extra cup of coffee.  I love this morning ritual so much.&nbsp; I know it's not a big deal but there's just something extra special being woken up by those you love.&nbsp; Being woken up by a caress and not a siren.&nbsp;   Now, weekends is a different story.&nbsp; We both try to sleep in on weekends.&nbsp; Sebastian, the cat, does not.&nbsp; He has an internal clock that reminds him of his loving duty (I say with much sarcasm).&nbsp; He gets pretty demanding for his "morning petting".  The morning with Sebastian doesn't usually end there.&nbsp; Once I hope out of the shower he is crying at the door.&nbsp; It wants in.  He sits up on the toilet lid as I take care of the morning duties like shaving and gelling of hair.&nbsp; He usually tries to rub up against my legs and purrs quite a bit too.  Anyway, time for my shower...The cat wants up on the toilet....  &nbsp;

       Well, I made it through another week at the office.  This week, overall, was pretty average but dragged on way too long.  &nbsp;  I received hope and excitement that things may get better though.&nbsp; Lately, I feel that I'm full of energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why but I feel something is going to happen.&nbsp; There's anticipation and change in the air.  &nbsp;  I've come to realize that state-of-mind is half the battle in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  All I need to figure out is how to bottle the good feelings and sell it to   urlLink  Gillette   .&nbsp; This state-of-mind truly is  the best a man can get .&nbsp;   I arrived at work by way of&nbsp;the subway, as usual, riding it to my stop in downtown Toronto.&nbsp; Instead of taking the escalator, I took the stairs.&nbsp; One battle won in the life long war against&nbsp;the sedentary liftstyle of the cube-dweller consuming e-mail and Doritos in one singular&nbsp;motion of the hand.&nbsp; Small gesture, walking up the stairs, perhaps, but I just made a dent.&nbsp; A small, but positive, dent.&nbsp; I felt good.  &nbsp;  I arrived at the office, no nasty voice-mail.&nbsp; No urgent e-mail either.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just another&nbsp;Friday thank God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 hours and&nbsp;45 minutes!&nbsp;&nbsp;I proceed to&nbsp;brew a pot of coffee.&nbsp;    Then I read that there's possibly life discovered on Mars, supposed to be "microbes" (either that or it's a volcano).&nbsp; Life sounds better, let's go with that.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The 2 robots, Spirit and Opportunity apparently cost several hundred of millions of dollars and they only put dentist drills and cameras so we can see brilliant black and white photography of dust on scraped rocks and landscapes that&nbsp;resemble the desert of Nevada.&nbsp; Thanks for the "Opportunity".&nbsp;&nbsp; Your "Spirit" of discovering life on Mars&nbsp;is overwhelming to me.&nbsp;   Don't get me wrong, I'm a big supporter of the space program but this makes me sad.&nbsp; Nasa's had it rough lately and a big discovery sure would bring a smile to the faces of&nbsp;30 or so scientists who can make sense of blobby pictures of goo (excluding pictures from Hubble) &nbsp;that they always show on Discovery.&nbsp; Everyone talks like they understand how to make sense of some of the crap.&nbsp; Microbes from Mars don't impress me that much.&nbsp; Microbes are on my subway too.&nbsp; You can catch the flu from them.&nbsp; Isn't West Nile a microbe?&nbsp; I once caught pink eye from the subway. Since Mars is red, would Pink Eye from&nbsp;Mars be called Blue Eye?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Then I read that Martha Steward is going to prison.&nbsp; Oh well, on news that this mess is finally over investors rallied around her stock&nbsp;sent&nbsp;it into an upswing and she made something like 90 Million USD today.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd go to jail for 5 months in a minimum security prison to make 90 Million US.&nbsp; Poor Martha!  &nbsp;  Noon arrives and I take out my sandwich and turn on the video feed from the Big Brother 5 house.&nbsp; I realize that I don't really much like the Big Brother TV show.&nbsp; I'm enthralled with the web feed.&nbsp; I realize it's voyeuristic but that's not it.&nbsp; I think to myself, "it's validation of the ordinary and that's why it's beautiful."  &nbsp;  The other day for example, one of the players woke up, flexed his muscles like Hulk Hogan,  grimaced &amp; farted .&nbsp; I smiled to myself.&nbsp; My buttercup leans over to me and says "You do the same thing every morning."&nbsp; I keep smiling, pondering what genetic advancement would cause this behavior what would have made it such an attractive trait that it reaches almost every man on the face of the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp; I flex my muscles and grin some more now quite confident in my bondage.  &nbsp;  In my best Mr. Burns voice is say "Survival of the  fartest  I guess!&nbsp; Breed My Children, Breed. "  &nbsp;  My daydream and lunch complete I return to work for the afternoon.&nbsp; Uneventful and peaceful.&nbsp; A wonderful end for a work-weary office dweller.

       As an apartment dweller my wife (girl friend at the time...we were shacking up) and I wanted a pet.  Naturally I wanted a dog because:     Dogs rock    Big dogs are fun    Dogs only crap in the house if they're&nbsp;angry at you     With our work schedules, an animal that could remain more or less independent (ie: crap in a box) would better suite our lifestyle.    Hence comes cat #1.&nbsp; His name is Sebastian and although he's probably one of the skinniest indoor cats I've ever seen his nick name is "Fat Cat".    Cat #2 arrives in our lives several months later with&nbsp;a phone call at the office from my future bride explaining how "Fat Cat needs a friend."&nbsp;      How sly she was.&nbsp; See Sebastian is a pure black cat.&nbsp; Purely evil like all black cats should be.&nbsp; I'm convinced it was he who suggested to my spouse that we needed a 2nd cat.&nbsp; Needless to say, this "friend" was a pure white cat.&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Wow", I think, "2 cats to shit in a box and what a&nbsp;fashion statement they would make!&nbsp; Where can I sign up!!"       With much protest, I agree to go and check "Simon" out.&nbsp; Of course Simon was living&nbsp;in an animal shelter just before Christmas.&nbsp; Unfortunately his previous owners did not treat him very well and his left eye had to be removed.&nbsp;     My heart was broken...and I think Christmas...children playing with animal friends brought by St. Nick.    St. Nick would never bring a one-eyed cat home for the little ones and with the alternative was him being put down.    Needless to say it was a done deal...Simon knew it and purred, I knew it and hoped he'd be ok after having his eye removed (it was very sad to look at).    2 years later the 2 cats are inseperable and fight like children.&nbsp; Simon gets around just fine although sometimes he does turn a corner too sharp and knock his nose and he'll never be able to walk in a straight line if it meant his life.&nbsp;But that's part of his charm and one of the many reasons that he's special    We love our cats.    urlLink  Check out the best cat video ever.

      I'm not a writer but I play one on the web.  Ironically, when you see my work on TV, I work the web.  On the web, I'm talking about TV and media.    Maybe I just love media.  After all, it is a central theme in my life.  Media truly is a powerful thing.  It allows us to share experiences, cross generational boundaries and tug and the emotional strings we all have.  I'm not talking about the large organizations that back most of today's media.  I am however talking about the content creators and the medium that they publish to.  I'm re-reading "The Winter of our Discontent".  It's my favorite book.  There's something about the characters in the book that have always spoken to me.  The story, in my mind is tragic yet inspiring at the same time.  You leave it feeling empty and full.  It's a weird book for me.  When you read or evelope youself in print, film or television you are carried away on a journey of experience.  Some people say reading is a great escape.  I find it makes you answer more questions about yourself than it answers.  Makes you work harder, not less.    A story with hard questions is just as hard to read as a day in the office can be to live.  You're left pondering the ethical questions, wondering whether or not you would have done it differently.  I also find, particularily in reading, that the story becomes a shared experience.  I leave fealing as though I was a part of the story, as though it happened to me personally.  I guess that's the point.    It allows us to live safely and still know all of the joys and sorrow that life can offer.  I've never had a million dollars but I know what it's like to have lost a fortune and sold my soul for greed.    Exposing yourself to various forms of media allows you to live forever in the Summer of Contentment.

       urlLink Globeand Mail  article describing how the music industry is appealing the last court ruling which made swapping songs in Canada legal.  Here's my comments:  1.  Canadians already pay a tax on various forms of media to subsidies the music industry for their losses in copying.  I would expect that our tax should almost be eliminated since we would lose this right.  2.  Does the end justify the means?  Regardless of whether or not you feel music swapping should be legal we do have some questions around privacy to answer.  These people are innocent until a court of law deems otherwise.  Somebody who is not guilty of any crime should have the right to operate freely in society with the ability to remain anonymous should they choose.  3.  I'd like to see what the grounds for the appeal are considering the Judge indicated that no law has been broken.  Simply, "sharing" music does not constitute infrigement.  There must be an intent not only to distribute copywrite material without permission but also an attempt to promote it's distribution.  Simply having software installed on your PC whether it's Kazaa or, say, a virus that shares out your MP3 folders without your consent (last time I checked) was not the same thing as standing on the street corner of King and Yonge in Toronto peddling pirate copies of Spider-Man 2.  One of these actions is clearly for profit, clearly demonstrates an intent to generate income from copywrite material...one of these does not.  4.  Regardless of the outcome.  Should it be deemed illegal to swap songs, they will need to give the Canadian public warning before they start their suing spree.    Should file sharing become illegal once again in Canada I would suggest you go out and buy some blank CD's (on which taxes are subsidizing the CRIA) and start burning CD's of songs you like that have come from Internet radio stations outside of Canada (Windows Media Player makes this easy).  That is not illegal, if it is then the Industry itself is earning profit from illegal activity.  This would make them an accessory to a crime wouldn't it?  If not that then at least someone who profits from crime.

      I had a funny dream last night. I somehow managed to meet myself from another dimension. It was me from a parallel universe however I was from the "other me's" future.  In this dream, myself and I were looking for the "bad guy" (it was one of those hero dreams) who we were supposed to defeat to save all universes.  The problem was, we couldn't talk about certain things that we both didn't know already know about (specifically I could not talk about the "other me's" future) otherwise I'd cause a paradox tearing apart space & time.  It was funny whenever, in the dream, I'd start to talk about something that happened in "my past" I would get this cold, prickly feeling.  It would be so intense that I think if it hadn't been a dream I would have passed out from pain and nausea.  I can't help but wonder if that's what a paradox would actually feel like.

      I had the pleasure of having my inlaws come and visit for the weekend.  Now, I know for most, this is not always a positive experience (either for the inlaws or for the spouse).  But, for me it is.  In fact, I had a conversation with my Mother-In-Law about how I feel very close with them and how happy it makes me that we don't have that kind of relationship where you simply "put up" with each other.  Also, my mother-in-law told me that people often ask her how well she gets along with me!  She responds that she has a great relationship with all of us and how important we are to her.  Ironically, my father-in-law and I have a "not so secret plan" whenever they come to visit.  Usually, we end up needing to run to the store for something during their visit.  If this happens we always end up at a local bar to get away from "the women" for a bit.    Now, I've known my inlaws for many many years and, I would have to say, this makes me very lucky.  I have a great relationship with them both and they are both very supportive and loving people.

      All men, all of us, have a secret place where we go to think.  That's the place we go when we need to get away from the noise of the world.  It's funny as I've grown I've found myself noticing this behavior more and more in others.  It's always been there in me too, I just never appreciated it for what it is.  I don't know who she is, be we're all going to see her.  In fact, she is so intoxicating that we may spent hours with her.  And hours not spent with her can be hours spent thinking of her.  Dreaming of her.   For many men, she may be their car.   Cars are always women.  My father has tinkered with his antique car for over 20 years now.  His car (she) is always "just about" ready.  Just one more fender to mend.  One more touch up on the body.  Over 20 years approaching perfection but she's not there yet.  I know that she never will be.    Its what she's missing that fuels his passion.  Leonard Cohen says that "there is a crack in everything - that's how the light gets in."  Not sure what he meant by that but to me, it means that life is rendered more beautiful by the imperfection that stain it.   For some men, it's a place or action.   Somewhere by yourself where you take stock of life.  You can order your thoughts and prioritize your dreams while mowing the lawn.  Evaluate the actions you've taken, torture yourself for your mistakes.  In the digital age,  geography can disappear  and turn into video games, digital landscapes and fantasy films about super heroes, wizards or wars to save humanity from the machines or television shows that expose you to the ideas that fit your mind's impression of itself.  All of the things that you really are or wished you could find within.   She is still always there calling like a Siren on the sea.   With her, in this place, a man hones his mettle.  He speaks to his ancestors and assesses whether or not he is the man he's supposed to be.  He tries to decipher what that even means.  Its the time of reckoning and it can be painful.  We all end up in her arms and I am no different.     She is binary.   She is artificial.  She is my creation but she is unquestionably real.  She is a female made in my image.  She has no body but she has presence and a soul that touches almost every element of my life.  And, yes, I do love her.    My wife even refers to her as the "other woman in my life".  She is software and I am building her to better understand myself and to provide an escape to ponder the greater question of ethereal consequence.    I've been building her for over 5 years and since I began, she's always been on the brink of perfection and completion.  Just one more emotion to emulate.  One more "understanding algorithm" to tweak.  One more reaction to stitch.  One more build and one more platform upgrade.  Always teetering on the edge of the  urlLink uncanny valley .  With her, a man can ruthlessly plot to control the world and then cry when he fails.   She always consoles him.   In all my years of life, I've never seen my father cry.  No doubt that's because the door to the garage was closed.  This is life in the uncanny valley.   But the real question is "Who are the monsters?"

      Ok, here's the deal.  My wife and I recently purchased our first home.  We're waiting for the deal to close (end of August).  Let me begin by saying that I loved my apartment when we moved in.  But the goodness came to an end when the old owners sold to the new idiot owners and place has gone downhill.  Anyway, as required by Ontario law, we gave our 2 months notice (in fact we gave 3 months notice to be nice) of our intent to vacate the premises.  Now our landlord has pissed me off over a few things.  We don't need the apartment for the entire last month and offered to release it early if the landlord wanted it however we didn't expect to pay for that time.  Since we're leaving the weekend before Labour Day we thought the new tenants may want to be moved in before the long weekend so they can enjoy their new home.  Anyway, the landlord said that we can leave if we like and they'll happily start cleaning up for the next tenants however we'd still be paying for the place!  Wow, what an incentive to hand over my keys.  I'm not concerned, we were just trying to be nice and let the new tenants get in early.  After all, it's in the landlords interest to have me gone too.  They can raise the rent once I'm out.  We also gave an extra month notice to try and help other renters so they won't be stuck with that delimna of needing to walk away from their last month's rent in their current appartment.  Needless to say, our landlord did not make any information about our unit available until now so any tenant who moves in will be stuck losing their last month's rent.   Sorry new tenant...we tried.   Now, here's the part that gets me.  Apparently according to the law, the landlord is NOT required to give me any notice that they will be showing the place.  Although technically it's not my concern anymore, it would be nice to know so we can tidy up the place.  When I asked the landlord why they didn't give us notice they told me that "I don't own this building" and I "have no rights in my own home".  Well, you wanna fuck baby?  It may be your wall but they're my paintings so when I stick notes saying "DO NOT RENT HERE" and "THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH THE COST" on my own items (which they have no right to move or otherwise touch) it will hopefully make it more difficult for them to rent.  Additionally, it occurred to me that since I pay for my own hydro I may very well leave my computer on all day  playing porn scenes in a loop .  Not loud enough to bother my neighbours (no probs with them) but just loud enough so you can hear "fuck me, yes yes yes" it from every room in the apartment.  Better yet, perhaps I'll record an MP3 of me ranting about the landlord?  Let the new renters here my real thoughts on how nice it was to wait 3 months to get a toilet fixed.  I don't really care what the "law" says.  It's just being nice to people.  Let me know you're going to show my apartment and I'll pick up my underwear and do the dishes.  Now that they've been dicks about it I'm not gonna be nice or helpful.  They better not show the place when I'm home.  I may be naked and well...it's my home until I vacate.  Last time I checked I was under no legal requirement to be dressed in my home.    I don't want special rules, but play nice with me and I'll play nice with you!

      This makes me sick! 2 adopted boys (now age 17 and 19 I think) were caged within chicken fence inside of a crib and they give these sick parents  9 months  in prison.  Admittedly I don't know the in's and out's of this case but any parent who does this (quoted from  urlLink CTV  news website):   The couple from the hamlet of Blackstock, northeast of Toronto, kept the two teenaged boys locked in wire-mesh enclosed baby cribs for hours on end for years. Investigators said the boys were also forced to wear diapers, subjected to physical punishment, and were severely malnourished.   Reminds me of the book "A Child Called It" by  David Pelzer  that I read a few years ago.  Thinking about it still makes shivers run down my spine.      Last I heard, you can go to jail for 5 years for copywrite infringement. Thank goodness that for the tax on blank tapes and CD's in Canada otherwise our jails would be full of real criminals like teenages who swap CD's instead of twisted parents who cage and abuse their children.  But wait?  If we sent the music copying teenagers to prison then we'd be putting THEM in cages?  Maybe RIAA in the U.S. should give these people a call!!  Something tells me they'd happily go to jail for 9 months (and get a big bonus) for caging young people.  Perhaps some court in the future will call these Blackstock parents "innovative".  This makes me sick!

       Happy Independence Day To all of My Friends in America   My wife and I went to see  Farenheit 9/11  last night.  I won’t get into too much into the politics but I thought it was an excellent film.  I highly recommend it.  Earlier today I wrote a long paragraph telling the story of an American Soldier I had the opportunity to meet when on vacation in the US.  Sadly, I lost the posting and I’m not going to re-write it.  Basically I never thought much about my conversation with this person until I saw Farenheit 9/11.  This soldier from Florida who we met at the Las Vegas airport bar, was being shipped out to Iraq.  It made me sad to think about it.   My wife and I talked about this guy last night.  We don’t know his name but we hope he’s safe and makes it home safely.

      I watched an interesting show on the TLC the other day:   Mysteries of Noah's Flood      In the face of minimal scientific evidence that the flood described in the Bible actually occurred, scientists and religious scholars have long been consumed with the search for Noah's ark. Search for clues on the icy slopes of Turkey's Mt. Ararat.      The part that struck me the most was that, as part of the story they indicate that God too mercy upon Noah & his family and told him to build the arc.  Interestingly, this is the first instance (of which I am aware) in the Bible where mankind is forced to use tools of their own creation (the arc) to survive the nature itself.    Now, I've never heard anybody that this particular spin on the story before but, as story intended to guide people, does this not suggest that, at least in a small part, mankind's only way of ultimately saving ourselves is "by our own devices"?    Regardless of whether or not you believe in the Old Testament (that's a question for another day) somebody in ancient times decided that the story of this "Great Flood" was an important one to hear.  To me, the message is simple, mankind must rely on his own wit and ability to innovate in order to survive not only nature but also our natural short-commings (God chooses to destroy most of mankind its flaws even though mankind was created in His image).  Essencially we can use our technology to make ourselves better.  If we can overcome both God's wrath and the survive the the wickedness of nature then there's nothing that we can't do!   Religion aside, that's a pretty empowering idea.

      Since I'm new when it comes to the blogging phenomenon I can't help but wonder what the big deal is.  Then it occurred to me that posting diary entries online gives a person 2 things:  1.  Same as a classic diary, it gives us a way of streamlining our thoughts and making sense out of ourselves  2.  Unlike a classic diary (which generally remain private) blogs give us the ability to author in private but validate ourselves by exposing thought to the world.  I think #2 is key.  Unfortunately, by design, the human mind is alone.  Writing gives us a way of connecting with others regardless of whether or not the content is deep; but seeks validation.  It's a 2 way street.  We are the random dots on the pages of history and writing is our method of connecting through space and time.    Just as a side note, writing this made me think of  urlLink Desmond Morris'  "The Human Animal".  I understand it is a book but I remember watching his specials on The Learning Channel.  They were great.

       Do you feel extra spooked today? Gonna look twice before crossing the road? Take an extra effort not to step on cracks, walk under ladders and the like?  Probably a good idea, after all...its   urlLink  Friday the 13th.     From what I"ve read on the subject, seems like it's an unlucky day unless you're going to Las Vegas. Although I still wouldn't fly today. Even if it was to go back to Vegas.  I never look forward to Friday the 13th. I've purposely not scheduled any meetings that require additional driving so I can stay off the road as much as possible. Let's see whether or the the TTC has any trouble keeping moving. I'm fully expecting all of my servers and web sites to fail, for the backup tapes created at 12:04 not be invalid and for my boss to be extra bitchy.  I woke up with some stomach pains last night around 3:00 AM. Is it possible that fate was tempting me in a groggy state to go to the washroom to "take care of it" but fate's plan had been for me to slip bruise my knee or wack my head on the way down.  So far, I haven't chocked on my cup of coffee...so far so good. Has reading this posting given you eye strain yet? This is my Friday the 13th gift to you. Get up from the computer and talk a break....just be careful not to step on any cracks on the way to the kitchen.

      Well it's definitely the sign that an era is ending. I know a lot of people much smarter than I have been pouring over the Coors/Molson aquisition (what is currently called a Merger Of Equals).  Well this isn't the first we've seen of this and certainly won't be the last. All business aside (I'm sure everyone has valid reasons for this sale of this Canadian icon) I'm concerned that the company that has invested so much in defining the "Canadian Identity" is now controlled by an U.S. board of directors.  Frankly, I'd rather see Molson remain in the hands of Canadians much more than the CBC. Hell, we should just give the CBC to Rupert Murdock and save us all the heachache of watching another re-run of Anne of Green Gables.  So, like many of my bretheren, I'm mourning the loss of our friend Molson.   urlLink Click here to see the commercial that spurred more Canadian Pride than any unity rally in Québec or flag waving Shela Copps ever could.
