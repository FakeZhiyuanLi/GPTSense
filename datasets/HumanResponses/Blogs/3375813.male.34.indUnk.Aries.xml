      Mobile phone companies hold the key to future payment processing but so far, none of them seems to have gotten it right. After the dotcom failure, they seem to have receded from their previous enthusiastic point of flexing their billing infrastructures, set for total financial services domination to focusing on their core business, which is selling airtime and only maintaining the white elephants m-commerce payment gateways as a reminder of how much it can cost to play the e-commerce game and loose. This however, need not be the future of m-commerce.   Introduction  The problems with paying for things are that it is slow, you need the right amount of money and if you want to pay by credit card, the merchant must be able to process the transaction in real-time to be sure of the legitimacy of your funds. Not only do you need relatively expensive infrastructure to process electronic money, the time to process electronic payment and the residual fraud liability associated with card fraud raises the bar to exclude many new start-up enterprises.  So, where traditionally payment processing was a necessary evil to do business, today it is a business enabler that can give small merchants with low turnover access to markets such as impulse buying and consumerism that didn't previously exist. For acquirers the challenge is to lower the payment processing costs for the merchants and thereby increasing their revenue by enlarging their install base, while still managing their fraud risk.  A number of companies have been formed since the event of electronic payment processing that tried to capture this market by utilising new and innovative technologies, but sadly, not many of them have succeeded in achieving the correct mix of critical parameters that would guarantee the successful commercialisation of their systems. And therein lies the catch: How to identify and manage the critical parameters to ensure successful m-commerce?   What are the new challenges to gain access to the future market  It seems that even though the technological requirements are relatively easy to meet, that there is always the mix of critical success factors that are hard to achieve and the same way that traditional monetary systems evolved in many unproductive paths, the current incarnation of m-commerce is also going about accessing their markets in a hit and miss fashion. What are the critical success factors for an m-payment solution? Since there are many more low turnover merchants than the Tesco's of the world, m-commerce must give the smaller merchant access to payment processing without a crippling large capital layout.  At the high end of the retail market, this requirement is diminished and what are important are improvements in efficiency and transaction costs.  The payment processing must be fast and simple to allow impulse buying and facilitate consumerism. Imaging the future of Coca Cola (or any other Fast Moving Consumer Goods company) without a rapid payment solution to allow users to quench their thirst when they are thirsty? The lack of fast and simple payment processing is hurting the retailers, but it is ultimately hurting the FMCG vertical market the most.  The net transaction cost must be lower than existing payment processing solutions because without changing the basic benefits of payment processing significantly (such as security, confidentiality and non-repudiation etc.) only when all parties benefit will such a system be of outright benefit to all.  Ultimately it must be more convenient to use and optimise the growing queueing culture with more people wanting to buy more items in more opportune locations.  Software costs should be realistic and that probably means very simple, secure systems. One of the drawbacks of the old e-commerce era was that payment processing software turned out to be relatively expensive and there was no effort made to link the software costs to the revenue generated by the system (or maybe people were just over optimistic?). What happened instead was the that the transaction costs turned out to be relatively high to pay for the expensive technological implementations and low participation rates. This is a bad way to do business since low participant turnout makes it more prohibitive for the existing participants to generate the required revenues with the result of mass disinterest in the system.  How often do merchants allow customers behind the counter? So, why do e-commerce operators insist on using integrated payment processing facilities which is not only expensive because of lack of standardisation (try to move your shopping cart solution between different vendors to see what I mean). but security and the implementation is conceptually difficult? Why handle both your customer orders as well as payment processing through the same web interface if you can move payment processing (still automated) to an existing out of band channel such as payment via mobile phone where the implementation is more standardised, transaction costs are lower and security is higher?   Why are mobile phone operators well placed in this market?  The reality is that the mobile phone operators are very good at keeping track of small units of measure (seconds of airtime) and billing that at variable rates to their consumers. Even more impressive is the fact that they do this not just for thousands of clients, but literally for millions of people, from all geographical locations. When last have you scrutinised your mobile bill in detail? Mobile phone operators are entering the phase where their excellent billing history makes them trusted payment processors and users believe that they are getting billing right.  But what is probably the biggest trump in the hand of the mobile phone operators, is a not always recognised benefit, and that is that they provide an trusted computing platform in the hands of the user which makes all the difference when it comes to electronic payment instructions and this is why:  During an electronic instruction, the critical steps of the transaction is where the user ties his payment instruction to some goods he wants to buy (or an identifier thereof) as well as the seller of the goods. From a legal point of view, a signature on a printed payment instruction is sufficient, but to truly experience the benefits of electronic payment processing, these identifiers must be electronic and they must be secure. And that is where the trusted computing platform comes in. Without the trust in the computing platform, there is no way that the user can truly believe that he has successfully tied his payment instruction to the electronic identifier specified and the merchant in question and without trust in the system, m-commerce will not move forward.  Even though a trusted computing device is probably the biggest benefit that mobile phones bring to the m-commerce, there are some other benefits, many of the relating to the fact that mobile phones are ubiquitous and the capital layout is minimal for entry into the system.  Transaction costs are also low because the existing secure communications and data network is being reused for payment processing.  Security is fundamental and when you compare a lost credit card to a lost mobile phone, you will realise that since the phone should not ever hold any sensitive material, unlike a credit card, when it is lost, voice and data services, including payment processing capability, can be suspended with a single call.  Mobile technology is so pervasive that almost anybody can buy anything from anyone else. This out of band payment processing facility means that m-commerce can be attached to any transaction type, ranging from buying items over the Internet, to buying your ice cream on the beach with your mobile phone.   What are the critical success factors for such a payment scheme?  They range from hard technological requirements to more un-deterministic psychological ones and I list a number of the more critical ones.   Conceptual requirements  Non-repudiation: buyers and sellers must not be able to back out of the transactions and this has to be at least comparable to existing “card not present” type transactions where buyers have a opportunity to reverse transactions under certain conditions and merchants must bare the brunt of these losses. Authorisation: The buyer must give a clear buying signal that cannot be contested. Confidentiality: No third party must be privy to any of these transactions taking place or the contents thereof.   Human requirements  Ease of use: Users must not feel technological pressure to have to “learn” the system, otherwise it in itself becomes an entry barrier. Users must trust that the system is secure and works The system must be efficiency (otherwise we could have stayed with coins)   Technology requirements  The link between the mobile phone and the back-end processor must be regarded as completely secure and no confidential information should be stored on the phone. The mobile should not store a communication history that can contain sensitive material such as passwords in clear format. “Keeping it simple” technology in terms of payment processing. The amortisation of the capital layout should be closely linked to the revenues generated by the software and not the other way round.   An conceptual payment scheme  How would such a payment scheme work? The reality is that it is dangerous to venture into the future when it comes to payment schemes, mostly because it has so often been proven wrong, but considering that there are a number of the psychological and technological details that need to be resolved, one possible scheme could be where a merchant sends a message to your phone stating an offer of goods you are interested in. The offer might be a text description with an MD5 hash drawn over it to reduce the size of the text you are dealing with. If you want to buy the goods, you would confirm the sale through your trusted device. This confirmation would consist of your signature (PKI keys should be stored on the back-end processor and transparent to the user if they are being used) of the hash of the goods and the merchant number. The mobile operator effectively acts as an arbitrator between you and the merchant by:  Firstly, keeping a record of the transaction for both party's edification.  By informing the buyer that the merchant has at least passed some vetting scheme to be able to use the payment processor. This might be as simple as the merchant is still with the processor with no complaints that rendered him suspended.  By informing the merchant that the funds have immediately been moved to his accounts and he can let go of the goods.  Thirty days later, the user will receive his regular phone bill, including all the purchases he made during the billing period and the merchant will receive his funds for all sales during the period.   Conclusion  The existing m-commerce solutions clearly miss the critical points of m-commerce and those are to leverage the existing mobile phone infrastructure to provide the ability to the whole of the mobile operators existing user base (which is effectively a very large fraction of the consumerist world) to buy stuff from other small or large merchants, using only mobile technology, thereby allowing so many more merchants into the market and ultimately generating real benefit and revenue for the mobile operators by leveraged their unique position in the market as trusted financial service providers.   Epitaph  I contacted Vodafone to find out how much it would cost me to open a small commodities shop and use M-pay for payment processing and their answer is included below. The situation is unclear to me since they already have a number of shops selling items of more than £5 each at http://www.vodafone.co.uk/mpay   Thank you for your email, unfortunalty Mpay only goes up to £5 and is really designed for digital content    Kind regards R   R XXXXXXXX  Business Development manager  Commercial Partnerships - Sales     References  M-Pay Valista Vodafone trail  Eircell Vodafone, Altamedius  Thomas Geitner, Chief Executive, Global Products and Services, Vodafone, www.merchantseek.com

      The purpose of the blog is broadly to demystify and clarify general items of interest to community at large and if you feel you can contribute, please send me an email so that I can offer you an account.  This blog is a tribute to Hofstadter who first mentioned the Skeptical Inquirer in MetaMagical Themas. Unfortunately, my copy of the book has now gone to a friend with the consequence that I cannot remember who were the good guys, the Skeptical Inquirer or the National Inquirer. So, if we get it wrong, then lets just call it irony!

       FBI arrest  The FBI recently had to apologize to Brandon Mayfield of Oregon for detaining  him for 14 days in connection with the Madrid bombings. The problem was the misidentification of a finger print on a bag of detonators and even though Mr. Mayfield insisted that he had not left the USA for a decade, he was still detained as a suspect linked through his finger prints to the terrorist bombing. This story illustrates an example of how security systems in general need to become more complex to understand the context in which an event is measured and then to search for other valuable clues to support the evidence that the event is in fact what you though it was in the first place, and not just a false positive. In the case of Mr. Mayfield, maybe the FBI should consider that a water tight alibi that places him firmly in Oregon for the 10 years leading up to the attack might indicate that they finger print was not such a good match as was though initially?   Security objectives  Security systems in general are there to reduce risk and ultimately save money. However, if they incorrectly identify events as false positives, then they cost money. I recently left my office outside of working hours and suddenly the burglar alarm was triggered through some action which is still unclear to us (and we are certainly not going to try and reproduce it). It costs the managers of the facility £50 every time the security company has to tend to such matters. In this specific case, you should wonder it the absence of any movement in the lobby might indicate a potential false alarm on the front door and save everybody £50 for the call-out? However, the question is not always if you can you identify false positives, but also if you can identify the truly dangerous events amounts the many positives as well. An example of this would be if the front door alarm, some motion detectors as well as the safe alarm is triggered, then you can probably deduct that a real burglary is in progress and step your level of response up appropriately. What is clear is that in today's world, you have to be able to measure context around incidents and then analyse that context to find supporting evidence that points to the event you have identified. Lets take an example of logical analysis. By specifying a range of logical conditions that must be satisfied and then ultimately producing the event that all these incidents support, you can gain greater confidence in the likelihood of the event being a true positive.   The broken record player  But what about circumventing these systems? Once the logical operation of these systems are known, then it is as easy as designing a procedure that will “outsmart” the system in question. Hofstadter referred to this procedure as “the record that broke the record player” in his Goedel, Esher and Bach. This question is related to Goedel's incompleteness theorem and I guess in the long run, it will be possible to always design a logical procedure to circumvent a logical design. So, what about non-logical procedures? Well, that certainly does become a little bit more interesting. Let us take the front door and lobby sensors as an example. Lets say the problem is that you don't want your pets to activate your motion detectors and you don't want a malfunction on the front door sensor to trigger your alarm. In our system the front door alarm activation must be accompanied by motion in the lobby within a certain period of time (where, if this period of time was fixed, the robbers could just wait for the specific period of time and then enter the lobby), but where the wait period is now randomly generated. So, once the front door is opened, the alarm will only be triggered if there is movement in the lobby within an unknown period of time. If the maximum waiting period is 48 hours (the longest possible time between normal access and therefore human inspection) then the mean waiting time for the robbers would be 24 hours with the possibly shortest waiting time being as low as 1 minute (which is of course highly unlikely) The problem has now fundamentally changed in that you now required gambling burglars (which they probably are!) to take a change to get into the build and by manipulating the wait period parameters, you can ensure that the system does not behave deterministically and therefore reduce false positives and false negatives.   Network security  In computer network security, the problem is even more extreme. Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems looks at individual data packets and then look their payload up in a database of known bad signatures. If it matches, then an alert is raised, but in reality, the identification of a signature of known bad behaviour is very difficult without understanding the context of the packet that was detected. An example would be an FTP alert that a user is trying to up or download material from the website which he is not authorised to do. The problem is that unless this packet is seen within a context of an FTP session, then it is a false positive. However, considering that the information about whether this is an FTP session, the login and password exchange protocol, happened long in the past by the time this packet is seen, means that the context of this packet is effectively lost. So, enters regular expressions where it is possible to specify that the requests for unauthorised information must be preceded by a FTP login request before this can be identified as a true positives. Regular expressions should have a significant impact on the improvement of network security alerts.

       How to make Intrusion Detection Systems work better   Every year in every large company the golden question is asked: “How much are we going to lose this year because of security failures?” The CITSO responds with:“Well, we need to find out what the likelihood is of things happening to us and we then need to check how much it will cost when those things happen to us. Once we have those figures, we can decide how much we have to spend and how much that spending will reduce the cost of these bad things happening to us”  So the first question is, how do we find out what the likelihood is of bad things happening to us? The most effective way to do this seem to be by measuring the daily activity on the network and seeing not only how many bad things happen on the networks, but also what their impact is on the organisation. This behaviour is then extrapolated and by correlating it with extraordinary global events (such as terrorist bombings), the “acidity” of the network can be predicted quite accurately.  So herein lies the problem, how to identify bad things. Intrusion Detection Systems have specifically been designed to detect bad traffic. In some cases, this means detecting traffic that contains data which is clearly identified as malicious, but in other cases, it also detects network behaviour that is out of the ordinary. But IDS's suffer from two problems, false positives when malicious behaviour is misdiagnosed and false negatives, when real attacks are missed. Examples of false positives are when signatures are triggered by themselves and the IDS then alerts on its own signature downloads while false negatives would be when an attacker substitute the NOOP sled (string of (sometimes) meaningless binary used to pad a buffer overflow until the function return value is located and overwritten) with binary data that is not detected by the IDS and the attack can therefore penetrate the environment undetected.  The real problem with IDS is actually that it is normally focused on assuming that the volume of alerts is important and that a large number of a certain alerts is more dangerous than a small number of another alerts. This design feature, combined with the fact that IDS events are context free in the bigger scheme of things (they stand by themselves and are not correlated with other events) result in false positives and irrelevant positives (a dangerous payload that went to machine not sensitive to it).  So, a whole new generation of Security Information Systems have been developed to collect data from all over your network and then correlate that data with your IDS data, thereby reducing false positives.  The broad idea is great, but it seems that most of these products will eventually be superseded by the capabilities of the IDS/IPS systems themselves for the following reasons.  1. All investigations start with the identification of anomalies and uses the rest of the information to qualify that anomaly, which means the IDS system is key to the whole design. 2. IDS systems are designed to deal with events and router logs, application logs and network banner grabbing produces events of a different kind that are still just events. 3. Large gains can be made by doing correlation of IDS events with themselves. Examples of this would be classes of alerts such as “attempted recon” that are then followed by “application exploit” are much more indicative of nefarious activity and raises the priority on clustered alerts that indicate a constructive effort to compromise a system.  What is also interesting is that by collecting application logs and system logs in your IDS for correlation, you now have the ability to alert on error conditions which might have been brought about by a security event or not, but is still something that has to be dealt with since it is costing you money and security systems are there after all to save you money!  False negatives are difficult to detect since they were missed by the IDS in the first place, but one can assume that application logs will provide more detail in the case of attempted or successful exploits, thereby exposing false negatives.  The bottom line is that visibility of network status is key to understanding risk and by correlating IDS alerts with application logs and other network information systems, false positives can be reduced thereby providing better information.
