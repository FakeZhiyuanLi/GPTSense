      I wish you could understand. I think so much. If I were an AI I would most deffinetly be rampant. That was one of the most geekiest things to say but it is true.  I am in such a bind I don't know how to get out of it. It is a shame that I can't help myself. Maybe if I didn't think about it so much...  Ah who is kidding who here.

      A shameless made up quote...  Before I continue I must say that I have discovered a rather amusing detail about meself. I will relate it to you in a form in which you will most likely understand:  I am starving, in fact I havn't eaten in three years. I am still alive though. When food is put in front of me, I stare at it for a long time but am afraid to begin eating. After a time it gets cold and is no longer suitable for eating. I get up from the table and sit back down on the floor, hungry as ever. In my mind I cannot bring myself to do what I long to do the most.  Is that not insane? What can someone do when put in a situation such as this? I'm going crazy here.  Off to Subway.

      Yeah so here I am, it is a Saturday night. I'm sitting here, on a borrowed 450mhz computer creating the first post in my 'Blog'. My friends are all at Kevin's house having a great time playing Halo. Why am I here? Two words: my mother. We can all learn a thing or two from her, mainly how effectively one can make the  least  sense. But as a rash of poison ivy, the more I itch the more the rash spreads. So, back Saturday night.  Let me look at what I do have; I have the internet, an Xbox, Law and Order: SVU, and lots of soda. I'm not going to even attempt Xbox, as that was the focus of last night (Friday). L&O: SVU is on and even though the audio of detectives chasing sexual predators may sound tempting I am typing this instead. That last sentence was supposed to read ..."I am instead typing this." but for some subliminal reason I changed that around. Can someone really eat 10 saltines in one minute?  Before I end this message I really must express that it is a shame you cannot hear what it is I think. Kidding myself that I have advanced thought patterns to everyone else is just an excuse that I can make so that I think that even though it seems as if I'm better than you, I'm not. You think about that now.  Screw it, I'm downing this Sujamma and upping my Balls level to 4.
