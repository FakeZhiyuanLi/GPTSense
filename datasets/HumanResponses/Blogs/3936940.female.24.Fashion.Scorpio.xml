      I should be banned from watching sad movies. Especially the ones that are sad LOVE stories. I saw The Notebook last night with a friend. It was truly a great movie. Unfortunately I started to cry 30 minutes in and didn't stop until I was almost home. Sometimes I think these movies give us an unrealistic ideal of love. Is movie love real? I'd like to think so but I don't know for sure because it's never happened to me. I'm a hopeless romantic so I guess I'll just keep hoping that my soul mate is out there somewhere wishing for me just like I'm wishing for him. Until that time comes, I guess I'm condemned to watch other's love unfold in the comfort of a dark movie theater with my popcorn in hand.

       Yes we do, and we eat it with a relish other people might reserve for a great orgasm.&nbsp; To us cake is kind of like sex anyway.&nbsp; If it’s good, it's really good and if it’s bad, well it’s still cake.&nbsp; You know on more than one occasion I’ve actually made a gay man a little tingly while he watched me eat a baked good.&nbsp; Not really sure what that says about me, but I like to think I showed my dinner companion a night he’ll not soon forget.&nbsp;   Lately I'm not getting so much cake.&nbsp; I finally did something that I loathe and detest.&nbsp; I went on a diet.&nbsp; I am now one of those girls that I can't stand.&nbsp; The kind who ask for their salad dressing on the side, and agonize over the entire menu, trying to calculate what has the lowest point value before they order.&nbsp; I drink water now instead of coke.&nbsp; I try to steer my lunch&nbsp;buddies to resturaunts that I know have&nbsp;points friendly menus.&nbsp; I'll go to a party and not eat the munchies, and worst of all I never eat&nbsp;the doughnuts people bring to the office anymore.&nbsp; Sometimes I ask myself&nbsp;"what have I become?"  To answer that question, a slightly slimmer, more points&nbsp;obsessed, version of myself.&nbsp; Basically though, I'm still me.&nbsp; I liked me when I was heavier and I still like me now.&nbsp; I do however, enjoy stepping on that scale every week&nbsp;to see the pounds tick off and know that I'm just a little bit closer to a healthier me.&nbsp; Well that and getting my ass into smaller pants.  My friends have been amazingly supportive as well.&nbsp; LBG checks in with me every Tuesday (my weigh day) to help congratulate me on my progress or to help motivate me when there is none.&nbsp; They bear my babble about points values with smiles and don't find it too weird that I take a jar of peanut butter with me where ever I go these days.&nbsp; For their patience and support I am grateful.&nbsp; And to those gay men who have had the voyeuristic pleasure of watching me eat baked goods, (and you know who you are) don't worry, I can still eat cake (well sometimes anyway).

      Where would we be if we had no DRAMA? Relatively speaking my life is fairly DRAMA free. I guess that's why we have gay men. Don't misunderstand. I love the gay. They are cute, and funny, like to shop, will tell you when your make-up looks good, notice when you have on new shoes, will go with you to get a pedicure and hold your hand for absolutely no reason. These are all great and wonderful things. Things I wouldn't trade for all the world, but to love a gay man (or men, as in my case) is to be on a first name basis with DRAMA.   We're not talking about your run of the mill high school, I saw Julie making out with Seth behind the dumpsters, DRAMA. I'm talking about Alexis and Krystal Dynasty kind of DRAMA. You know where the cat fight starts out in sitting room and some how manages to end up in the fountain out front. Waterlogged starlets are pulled from the fountain with shirts ripped, bras exposed and a clump of each other's hair in their fists.   God love them they do keep us on our toes.   I imagine the DRAMA quotient is fairly high with one gay man. LBG and I have 3! That's right, count 'em 1-2-3. And usually the DRAMA is between some combination of the 3.   For instance, T &amp; J fly to California to visit R. R and T have a bit of a past. They began their relationship as make out buddies and over the years have settled into a friendly type relationship. Because of their dubious beginnings their relationship can get a bit difficult at times. Anyhoo... R used to date Mr. X and still had some unresolved feelings for him. During the visit T, J and R bump into Mr. X out at a club. T doesn't know Mr. X and R had a thing. Later in the evening T and Mr. X kiss and R sees them. R is NOT happy with T or Mr. X and decides to leave. J accompanies R home because he is upset and T goes home with Mr. X. When R gets home he decides to take out his revenge. R dumps the entire contents of T's suitcase onto his front lawn. R's neighbors come home and begin to eyeball T's belongings like they just stumbled upon a yard sale. J, ever the mediator, decides to rescue T's underwear and shoes from the front lawn and the evil clutches of the fashionista neighbors, and puts all of T's belongings back into the house. This infuriated R who intended for those clothes to remain right where they were. So what does he do? Promptly throws all of the clothes back out onto the lawn.   Can you believe that? Not only did R toss the clothes onto the lawn, but he did it AGAIN after J so sweetly picked them up. Thankfully, R and T resolved the issue and we all lived happily ever after (well until more DRAMA popped up), but that's another story. To this day J, LBG and I cannot talk about the incident without dissolving into a fit of giggles.

        "I'm living in a material world, and I am a material girl." - Madonna   I really love to shop. Even if I don't buy I thing, I still love to browse and try on and touch the various pieces of merchandise. I know I can't afford (even at half price) the hot pink leather Marc Jacobs purse laying in the clearance bin but that doesn't stop me from fondling the leather or tucking it under my arm while I continue to dig through the bin. Finally when I've spent as much time as I can rummaging around in the purse bin, I know that I have to relinquish my hold on this unattainable purse. Just holding it is enough to give me that heady sensation you get from buying something you truly love. I lovingly place the purse in it's clearance bin and bid it farewell.  This is not an uncommon shopping scenario for me. I'm perfectly happy to shop even when I can't afford to buy anything. I don't understand people who, when they have no money in their budget for shopping, don't even want to go to the stores and browse the merchandise. I just don't get it. I can entertain myself for quite sometime just trying on shoes I'll never buy. The more outrageous the better. I think nothing of asking for a pair of hot pink patent leather zippered stilettos in a size 7 1/2. I have nothing to wear these shoes with and even if I did, I couldn't buy them because they make my feet groan in pain as soon as I slip them on my feet. I guess some might consider this a complete waste of time but I see it as no different than someone who's hobby is fishing or cabinet making. It's just something I like to do that passes the time.  I love make-up counters and displays of jewelry. Hats and scarves and sunglasses. Anything that you can easily try on and glance in a mirror to see how ridiculous or fabulous the article in question makes you look. And yes sometimes some of these items do manage to find their way home with me, but more often than not I leave them exactly where I found them.  Maybe you've heard of the term "retail therapy". Maybe you know exactly what that means, or maybe you didn't think it even existed. For me it certainly does. A day of shopping/browsing can do wonders for my mood. Can make me happy when I'm sad and be calming when I'm pissed. I'm not sure what that says about me as a person but I guess it really just comes down to the fact that I've never outgrown playing dress up.

      Did you ever feel lost? I'm not talking about not knowing where you are for fifteen minutes or ending up in an unfamiliar neighborhood. I'm talking about no direction, adrift in the sea of life, kind of lost. That's pretty much how I feel right now. My life has absolutely no direction and little meaning. I feel like I've been treading water for the last 4 and half years. Steadily swimming and getting nowhere. I'm still afloat but I'm sick and tired of swimming and not finding the shore.  I think it's destined that your 20's must suck. When you're still in college your 20's are great. You can finally drink legally, you can buy condoms without embarrassment, technically you're an adult, etc, etc, etc. After college is a completely different story. You greet the world with enthusiasm and fearlessness.....at first. Then you get your first job and realize that working for a living sucks. Being an adult sucks. Getting up for work EVERY morning sucks. Paying bills sucks. Everything sucks.  I've lost all motivation. I come to work and sit in front of my computer for hours on end just staring at the screen. I go home and sometimes find the will to throw something together for dinner and then I collapse in front of the television and stare at that screen for several more hours. I don't feel like washing clothes, cleaning, washing dishes or doing anything generally productive. I hate being like this but I don't seem to be able to snap out of it. The only true joy in my life comes from my family and friends. Thankfully I'm still a happy person around them.  I just need a goal or some general direction in my life. I know I'm not happy and I feel like I'm too young to be this miserable. What do you do? Do I just quit my job and hope for the best? Do I stay and hope for the best? Currently my solution of sending out endless resumes and sitting at home with a pack of cigarettes waiting for the phone to ring isn't cutting it. Imagine that. I'm tired of treading water and sometimes wonder if it wouldn't be easier to just give in and let the sea take me. This option could go one of two ways: the current could lead me to shore or I could be devoured by sharks. I don't know about you but the shark thing isn't appealing. I guess it's this option that keeps me swimming.

      I have come to realize there are all kinds of love in this world. I love the Rolling Stones and a good cheesecake, but not the same way I love my parents. I love beauty products and pedicures and I love a good bourbon and ginger ale. I also love J.  I love all of my friends very much. I love A because she's been there for everything; she is my childhood. I love D because she helped me through a really tough period in my life and helped me pull through with laughter. I love C because she made college really fun and carried some of the same battle scars I did. I love LBG because she feels like the twin I never had, my other half; so very much like me and yet so different. I love T because he helped me through a tough time but he also expanded my world. I love R because he's funny and bitchy and well, just R.  Why do I love J? He's the calm to my storm. When I see him, he smiles at me with his eyes. He fights back. He isn't afraid to tell you he loves you. He isn't afraid to tell you when you're being an ass. He holds my hand. He's the bravest person I know. He loves to go to the movies. He gets excited about the small things. He kisses my forehead. He makes me CDs. He knows all the words to the songs in Grease 2 and Labyrinth and all the great one liners in Clueless. He calls. He doesn't care if I cry during a movie. He has the best smell. He likes to sleep butt to butt. He wears colors only found on Easter eggs. He loves football. He makes me laugh. He makes me laugh. He makes me laugh.  Our relationship defies labels and is sometimes complicated. Love isn't defined by romance novels or romantic comedies. Things don't always turn out right and we don't always say or do the right things. Our lives are messy and sometimes difficult. I don't care that some people don't understand. I don't care that we blur boundaries. What matters is that we are there for one another and there is love.
