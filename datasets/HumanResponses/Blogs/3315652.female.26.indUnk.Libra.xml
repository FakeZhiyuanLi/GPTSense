      My name is Chrissie. I'm 26 years old. I have two daughters, Chenoa (3) and Cherina (21 months.)  I left my husband in March. He was controlling, manipulative, and verbally abusive. He never let me have any money, claiming that he didn't have any (but he had enough to buy beer,) accused me of stealing money when he'd clearly lost it, hated my friends and family and resented their presence, put me down (my pet name was "stupid bitch") called me a bad mother, threatened to take custody of the girls if I left him, accused me of cheating on him, threw baby fits when he didn't get his way, and basically worked to suppress and kill anything that was a part of me. And he tells all his female friends via email that all he wanted was for me to love him and want to be with him.  The final straw came when he had a female friend come over to visit him. I found out that day that he had lied to me about how he met her. he had told me that he took the girls to the park, and they met there because our kids approached her kids. However, upon learning her name, I realized that he had been talking to her before that. Her name was in his cell phone for AT LEAST a week prior. And later on, after snooping thru his email, I learned that he had met her on a dating site.  Also that day, I discovered that there was a spy camera in my living room. Up until that day, I thought it was a simple alarm clock. I found the receipt for it when I was cleaning the bathroom.  So I decided to leave. I wasn't going to live in a house with a spy camera and a husband that thought it was OK to cheat on me right under my nose.  I called my mom and asked her to come pick up the girls so I could pack my things. She came and got them, and I started packing at about 3pm. My husband and his brother left at that time as well. It took me a long time to get my head together and figure out what to take and what to leave, and to find boxes... so I was still trying to get things together at 2:30am the next morning, when husband and his brother came back, drunk.  Husband came into the back bedroom where I was, packing. I had the stereo on. He ripped the speakers off the stereo and knocked some things over. I asked him to please leave me alone. he yelled at me, saying that this was his house, and he paid the rent, and he didn't have to do anything if he didn't want to. On and on it went, and his brother got in on it as well. They wouldn't leave me alone. So I told them that if they wouldn't leave me be, I'd call the police. Which I did. And the whole time, his brother was talking over the 911 operator, so I couldn't hear her... threatening me, saying "well, if this is how you want to handle things, we'll just see what happens" and threatening my brother, who wasn't even involved, etc.  When I got off the phone with 911, they both went outside. I locked the door on them so to avoid any further confrontation until the police arrived. When they did, they banged on the door. I opened it, they questioned me as to what was going on, and before I knew it, I was handcuffed. The police told me that my husband had a red mark on his face, and had said that I slapped him.  Off to jail I went, for something I didn't do. I spent a day and a half in jail. My PR bond was denied... the only reason that could have been was that he told the police he was afraid of me. So my parents bailed me out. He filed a protective order on me, which has since been lifted, filed for divorce, and is now trying to get full custody of the girls, just like he always said he would... and I am awaiting trial for the alleged slap.  So now, I'm dealing with the aftermath of a trainwreck. I'm living with my mom and stepdad, outside Austin. I have a crappy part-time job, and even though I have no rent or bills to pay other than legal expenses, my paychecks are gone by the time I get them. I have no car to get to and from work, so I'm relying on Mom to drive me around. I'm trying to get enrolled in community college so that I can better my life and those of my girls, but seriously... I have NO idea how I'm going to handle all of this. I'm sure I can get financial aid for school, but in the meantime, how am I going to afford to live? I can't stay with my parents forever. They're planning to move 60 miles away from here in the near future. I have nowhere else to go, no way to get there... and who's going to watch my kids while I'm at work and school? I can't afford daycare. I can't afford a car. I can't afford a place to live. I can't even afford my insulin, or to see a doctor. (I'm diabetic, by the way.)  And as far as the girls go... they're being carted back and forth between here and their dad's house every week. I just dropped them off today, and I get them back next week. His mother has left her house and job in Houston to take care of the girls while he works. His brother is living there as well... and I think the woman he's been seeing is staying there. At the very least, she's spending nights over there. I have a neighbor who lives across the way from him, and she keeps her eyes and ears open for me.  Anyway, that's my story. I'm overwhelmed and confused about my future, and even though I want my girls with me, I don't know how I'm going to handle it all. I'm very scared that I'm going to lose them.

      It went well.   I thought it was trial day, but it wasn't. Turns out it was only docket call. Somehow my lawyer neglected to tell me that...   Either way, there isn't going to be a trial. My lawyer talked to the judge, and I ended up taking a plea bargain. I'll go to a class called "Stress Level 1" and the case will be dismissed. No criminal record, no nothing. The ex now has nothing on me, custody-wise. Unless you count the nicer place to live and the better paying job, which doesn't mean a thing really... he'll be paying child support, if things go the way they should.  So, that's one less thing for me to worry about. Yippee!  ~Chrissie

      I am stressing, hard core.   My trial is on Tuesday, and my stomach is in knots. I just keep running over the possibilities in my mind... wondering what his lawyer is going to ask me, how he's going to twist my words and make me "trip up..." the whole thing is a joke. I just wish my ex would cut the crap and tell the truth... that there's no reason for a trial, and that I never slapped him. Such a stupid thing to have a full-blown jury trial over. Waste of everyone's time.   My kids are coming home tomorrow... at least I have that to look forward to. I wish I didn't have to go to work, so I could spend the day with them. But, no. My day off will be spent in court, battling a false assault charge filed by their wonderful father.   I have trouble sleeping lately. I lay down and get immediately nauseous. My nerves are shot. I hope after Tuesday, I can say justice was done and breathe a little easier.   ~Chrissie

      I got paid yesterday, and I'm already broke. My lawyer won't be getting a check this week!  My trial is on Tuesday, so I decided to go out and get something to wear for it. I went to three stores, and only at the last one did I find something suitable. But along the way, I found other things that I liked... I needed the clothes, since I don't have anything for summer, and it's HOT here... but I still feel really guilty about spending a whole week's pay in one day. Here's what I got:  3 tank tops @ 7.50 each (sale) Denim shorts @ 24.50 Brown embroidered sleeveless shirt @ 22.50 Pink shorts @ 8.50 (sale) Blue striped shirt @ 7.50 (sale)  2 bras @ 9.99 each (sale) White shirt @ 8.50 (sale) Black pinstripe slacks @ 9.99 (sale) Matching sundresses for my daughters @ 9.99 each  Add that up and you know I don't get paid much. LOL... gonna be a hard week with no money. I hadn't shopped in forever, though, and I REALLY needed the clothes! I guess I'm gonna have to get over it somehow. Can't run around naked all summer.  ~Chrissie

      My sister Gina, my 12-year-old twin nephews Robby and Bryan, and my 19-year-old nephew Kenny came to visit. Oh, can't forget her friend Howard. Talk about an exciting, yet exhausting experience. I hadn't seen my sister and the twins in 7 years, and I hadn't seen Kenny since he was 2.  We stayed up till 4am talking... well, actually Gina talked and I mostly nodded. LOL... that woman can talk. And they're all LOUD talkers. It's like they have to shout over each other all the time.  Next morning when we got up, Kenny and I went into Austin. By He wanted his hair dyed black, so we went and got a box of hair coloring. We went out to eat, and then we stopped by my friend's house so she could meet him. Then we stopped by my brother's job so Kenny could meet his uncle. I was glad I could spend some time with Kenny. He's a lot like me... we're into the same music, our personalities are a lot alike. I wish he could have stayed behind with me for a little while. We could have had some fun cruising the town.   We got home, dyed his hair, and made dinner. Those people can EAT. I was glad I had stopped at the store and bought some extra food! There were almost no leftovers when we were all done.  They left at about 10pm last night, and by that time, I was exhausted. I was really happy to see them, especially Kenny. But after that short visit, I needed some downtime.  This morning, I woke up feeling deathly ill. I thought I was coming down with flu or something. I called in to work and stayed home. I slept almost all day, and now I feel almost completely better. Except now my stomach is killing me. Hopefully I'll be alright by tomorrow. I can't afford to miss another day of work.  Chrissie

      OK, so I've neglected my blog. Oh well... nothing interesting's going on.  I took the stress class... so my criminal woes are behind me. Whoopee!  I hate my job... my boss is leaving, so I'm going to be "running the show," as she puts it. No word of a promotion or raise, though. I'm job hunting. I submitted my resume to a couple of companies. Now let's pray that I hear something. I have GOT to get a better job if I've got any hope of leaving my parents' house before they move deeper into the buttcrack of Central Texas.  So I'm still just sitting here, stagnating... nothing seems to be changing at all. No word from my lawyer about the divorce, or custody case... just sitting here in limbo... waiting for something to happen.  ~Chrissie
