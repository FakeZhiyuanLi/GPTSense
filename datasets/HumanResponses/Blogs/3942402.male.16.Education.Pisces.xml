       Yesterday night,&nbsp;I went home after watching the movie 'Connie and Carla'. Was really&nbsp;a funny show cos mostly gays. lol, then went to geylang and eat some durians. On the way back,&nbsp;I saw some postitutes. They are really very pretty.&nbsp;Today morning after tea, my parents and I went paying visit&nbsp;to both my&nbsp;past away grandparents. Then now I'm home and later have to go for muaythai class at 5pm. The whole day&nbsp;was so packed, don't&nbsp;have much time for myself.&nbsp;My classmate, kelvin introduce&nbsp;'outpost' this game to me. Wondering whether its nice or not cos I'm downloadin now. So bored and looking at my younger bro playing his toys in front of me. Those superheroes flying here and there, cars crashing and the sound 'bish,&nbsp;bash, ahhhh..' so loud. Then the bad guy dies and reborn again. Sounds so stupid but quite&nbsp;cute. hahahaha ...&nbsp;

       Same as before, homework not done yet. I laughed like hell in mother tongue lesson today. wahahaha, Li kept making jokes and laughin non-stop. Then they took my pencil case and acting saying they didn't take. After 1 big round, they returned me.&nbsp;I cancelled my tuition cos I'm very tired.&nbsp;I came back from school around 4.30pm, finished snooker training. Then tomorrow&nbsp;I have N level MT oral. Sounds very fearful but I'm not. Eventually, it's quite easy anyway. My friend, Fiona is always behind me when it comes to oral. Haha, think of it also funny. Today she brought chewing gum for us, so nice of you. But I won't thank you. lolz! &nbsp;So boring, think I gonna have my dinner. Its so late to have my dinner...

       Yesterday, I came back from muaythai training. My&nbsp;thighs and arms&nbsp;was hurt&nbsp;so I didn't go to school today. Homework also not done yet. Hehe. I got boxed&nbsp;twice on the left eye and stomach while sparring with my trainer.&nbsp;Later on, I&nbsp;sparred with my best friend Li and I felt guilty cos I accidently hit him quite hard on&nbsp;his eye. Then we went to take the MRT at 11.15pm at chinese garden and it was 1 hr journey back home. So tiring when I reach Tampines and there was no bus. So I walked home with a cig on. Think I gonna have my lunch now, hungary... bRb~

       Today I&nbsp;woke up quite early suddenly  &nbsp;I saw alot of people whom&nbsp;I donno in my house. Later I found out&nbsp;my mum is oragnising a party without letting me know. Maybe yesterday I didn see her then she forgot to tell me. As my hair had reduce to botak, I don dare to mingle with&nbsp;em`. I brought my laptop upstairs my room and use it. It was quite noisy in the morning, wondering why&nbsp;my mum invite them in the morning. I'm in my room alone doing nothing and facing&nbsp;3 walls. Noone call talk to&nbsp;me, sister sleepin and brother went for tuition classes. Think&nbsp;I'm gonna do something to keep myself busy. Gotta go, seeya~ I still have Muaythai lessons later on.. on &amp;&nbsp;on...

        &nbsp;Today was a very terrible day for me in class as I kept on falling asleep. I forgotten to do my POA homework and was punished by standing outside the class. But I found a way to keep myself cool and relaxing, so i sat on the ground.&nbsp;A bunch of&nbsp;lower sec pupils passed by and looked at me differently. Just wondering is there anything wrong with me? And after school, we went to look for&nbsp;Miss Zhang with my friends, roger and anli and the&nbsp;rest of the girls. Her last day in school today and a girl even cried for her. So touching scene. Heard she's going for her further studies and that's a great news. Opps, I going out for snooker soon..seeya
