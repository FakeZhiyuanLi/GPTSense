       Hello. I haven't really done a lot today. Just woke up, finished my book, talked to Jeff on the phone, did all of my chores, took a shower, and then Aaron called me.       I'm going to the lock-in at my school today from 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. so that should be fun, I hope...lol. I need to go in a min. and finish getting ready for that, I'm just waiting for my hair to dry so I can straighten it.       Yep...Well, I guess I have no more to say...although I wish I did. Hm...I'm listening to "The Girl All The Bad Guys Want" *Good song!* Yep...well that's it, lol. Goodbye for now!

       School is going to suck soo freaking bad. I seiriously DON'T want to go back. Especially to Fossil Ridge...everything about it sucks. People always say..."Oh...it's going to be soo cool because it's all new." Well, because it's all new...no one is gonna know what's going on...they are gonna be trying new stuff on us, and all this crap...like I feel like I'm not even gonna get the 'high school experience' that everyone gets because I'm the 1st class to go through this high school. If I hate it after 1st sememster, I'm switching to a diffearnt school, I'm not even joking.

       I just signed off of AIM...and said goodnight to my bestest friend, Jeff. For some reason...all of a sudden, it just hit me...how lucky I am to have a best friend like Jeff. We are seriously at the point where we can like finish eachothers sentences, no joke. If I'm trying to say something...but I don't know how to say it...Jeff can explain it for me, and I can do the same for him. It's sooo cool to have someone there for you like that. He's like my older brother, watching out for me, teaching me everything...he's the coolest and most amazing person you will ever meet. I just wanted to say how lucky I feel to have Jeff as my bestest friend in the whole entire world!

       Hey Hey Hey! I actually had a chance to sleep in today, and gosh, did that feel good. I woke up at 10:00 a.m. and then read for about 30 min. I'm reading this book called 'Keesha's House' (I think that's what it's called anyway) and it's pretty interesting, it's written in a weird/poetic way. After I read that I got on-line to see if Jeff was on and he wasn't, so I put my away message up and then I went and ate breakfast. After that I came back and Jeff was on! So then he called me and we talked for awhile. We talked about all the stupid but funny memories with me and Michael, lol...good good times! Oh, last night I had a dream and Michael and Jeff were in it! It made me happy...lol of course, because the 2 best people in the world were in my dream! After I hung up with Jeff I practiced the piano and then put my CD cases in alphabetical order, lol...I have no life, I already figured that out. Then I got changed, and Jeff called again! Later I'm going to Epic to work out and then take a shower, get ready and go to the mall! Woo Hoo! Well, I guess that's all I have to say for now, so I'll write in here later! Luv yall!

        I never talked to Michael yesterday. I don't know why he never called: maybe the phones weren't opened up yet, or maybe he got in trouble for calling me the other day (and wow, would that suck). I just woke up this morning, missing him more than EVER. Like, I realize that I actually NEED him. These days are going by sooo slowly, but at the same time I want them to go by slow because there's barley any summer left and this last summer is a summer I'll never forget.     These past 7 months--I'll never forget. So many things have happened. So many tears spilled, so many sounds of laughter, and the feeling of love. Everything in these past 7 months is more than I thought I would ever experience in a life time. I guess I'm lucky I got to experience all of these things...even if they weren't all happy times. In fact most of them weren't happy, but hey, I guess I'm a stronger person today because of it all, and I'm closer than ever to my best friend and my boyfriend. I don't know why I just said all that, but I guess I got it all out.       I'm actually in a very good mood right now, happy you could call it, lol. Yesterday was just "an off and on" mood, but today I'm happy, yay!       Well, I guess I'm not really doing anything today, I might be working out, but it depends how my muscle is feeling. Other than that, I'm just waiting until Jeff gets home from court. So until next time...um...goodbye? (Tee Hee) Wow...I'm such a loser!

       Hey. I just got home from church, and it was actually a pretty cool message our pastor was talking about, so it wasn't boring at all. We got done early too, so that was nice. I feel like I'm in a better mood right now than I was yesterday morning. The thing on my mind is going back to school though, and I REALLY don't want to. This summer has just been amazing...and I've made lots of memories...I guess I just don't want to move on. Well, tonight Michael is calling at 9:00 p.m. so that should end my day well. I guess that's all for now.      "Back To California"     How long I’ll wait   Just to say goodbye   Ten different ways to enjoy this night   Can’t do this anymore   Won’t feel you anymore How long I’ll wait   Just to say goodbye   You could never let me in   Holding on until the end The time I waste just to say goodbye   Out of your way I could do this right   Can’t see you anymore   Won’t feel you anymore How long I’ll stay   Just to say goodbye, say goodbye Leave it all the fights and all   Summer’s getting colder   Drive all night to hold you tight   Back to California   Days went by    We waited and I guess we’re getting older   We couldn’t win in the end You’re gone   I’m miles away   Turning out your lights   Ten different ways I could end this night   Can’t do this anymore   Won’t feel you anymore How long I’ll wait   Just to say goodbye, say goodbye Leave it all the fights and all   Summer’s getting colder   Drive all night to hold you tight   Back to California   Days went by    We waited and I guess we’re getting older   We couldn’t win in the end You’re gone

Nope, not yet      If yes, tell me about your job; if no, why not? I'm getting one soon...once I can skate again      Describe to me your personality: Um...I guess I'm understanding, kind, I don't judge people, I can be crazy/fun, hyper, trustable, loyal, I try to look at things differant ways so I can see all point of veiws...and I guess that's about it, lol      What do you do when you’re bored?

LoL...I could go on and on and on about Michael...but I guess I'll just say the basics...He's pretty much one of my best friends and I can tell him ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. I really mean that too. He respects me...and I can just be myself completly around him. He makes me sooo happy...and just wow. He's the most amazing person you will ever meet...words can't describe him. He's 5'11" almost 6'0" and he has short brown hair, and brown eyes and he's going into the military.      As far as looks go for the opposite sex, what makes you want to look twice (in a good way, lol) In other words, what’s your type, physically?

Are you all for or against public displays of affection? Um...for I guess...just so it doesn't get too out of hand.      Which is most important to you in a relationship - faithfulness, compatibility, or excitement? Probably faithfulness...because if you don't have trust...you don't have anything.      If you really like someone, are you more likely to eventually ask them out or forever hold your peace? I wouldn't know...I've never had to ask anyone out...everyone I've gone out with has asked me out.      What’s the best place for a first date? Um...I don't know, I guess just somewhere where you can both be comfortable but have fun at the same time.      Would you prefer more romance or fun in a relationship?

Yes      Ever had your heart broken? Yes      Ever broken someone else’s? Um...I think so...      Would you rather date a bunch of people all throughout high school and settle down when you get older or meet "the one" while you’re still young?

       Hey. My 2nd entry of the day. How exciting. My Xanga is a little messed up right now but I'll keep writing in that too because that has like records of everything I have gone through. Jeff is over right now and he's sad because he doesn't have a dog...and the only dog he owns...he shot with a tranquilizer gun. Anyway...I'm all happy now. Michael finally called me...and he wasn't suppose to, but he did anyway...lol, well that's Mike for you all. Jeff and I have just messed around the whole time. We even drew in our driveway with chalk! It was lots of fun, people thought we were retarded though...lol. I've also tipped my computer chair over twice so far...lol. Well, I guess that's all for tonight. Luv yall.

       Today just feels crazy. Yesterday I was so happy...and today it's totally opposite. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still happy...I guess today is just not my day. I really don't know why either. I guess I just have a lot on my mind with starting school, tryouts, acupuncture, possibly getting my wisdom teeth out this up coming week, registration...and not one of those things I want to do. I wish I was able to just live a free and normal life...do what I want to do, but I guess everything happens for a reason. I'm waiting for Michael to call today...he said he would, so he should. Well...I guess I have nothing more to say...so I hope everyone that reads this has a great day.
