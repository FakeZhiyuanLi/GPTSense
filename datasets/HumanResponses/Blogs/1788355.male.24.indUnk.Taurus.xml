      At some point in the near future, it will be possible to know for  urlLink certain  whether or not someone is lying, fix depression, and essentially read their mind. The technology is edging closer and closer, to discovering which areas of the brain are active during certain thought processes, it is now only a matter of time.   Caplan gives a convincing argument as to why it is ethical for us to develop the tools to detect lying, and modify our brains and the way the work. Such modifications may enable us to learn at incredible paces. French in an hour, read faster, remember things perfectly. Who wouldn't want to learn a new language in an hour? Or read a book in minutes. Have perfect memory, or erase past traumas.   If we had a machine that could tell if someone was lying, one would have to define a lie. You couldn't really find the truth in such a machine, just what the person believes to be true; what actually happened versus, their perceptions. (That point came up in talking to JohnnyMac) Scientists who looked at brainwave outputs saw differences in activity in regions of the brain from lies and truths. Apparently it takes less work for the brain for one to tell the truth. Of course one could tell a lie with impunity if one would believe the lie they told, but then at that point, it ceases to become a lie.   But at what point do our enhancements stop? Just because we make ourselves better, faster, and smarter, should we? At what point do we become less human?  Earlier this year a Nasa project  urlLink surfaced  to setup 'mind readers' at Airports to "detect passengers who potentially might pose a threat." Do we trust the government to use such a power? One does not have to be paranoid to see such a power being abused by political powers. If Stalin had the ability to detect someone's 'intentions,' do you not think he would have done it? What would a president do to protect a nation? Scan everyone to find the terrorists in our midst? We live in a time where the government sees everyone as a potential threat, a potential terrorist. Are we as a people responsible enough to handle such a power? I think not. Sounds like  urlLink 1984 ? So does many things that our  urlLink government  is  urlLink currently   urlLink doing .  At the point that it becomes possible to give people perfect memory, it will become possible to fabricate memories, or erase them. At the point one could fix brain defects and cure people of schizophrenia, you could give people these diseases. With the power to create, and fix, comes the power to destroy.   Is it worth opening this box? Do the benefits outweigh the dangers? That's something that will have to be debated. But certainly, just because we can do something, doesn't mean that we should.   I for one, do not wish to have a perfect memory. There is something about how memories fade... Often one remembers thing better than they actually were. Perhaps, there is bliss in my ignorance. I don't mind it, it is part of the human experience. Perhaps that is something that will change with time.  ~Ben

      Now, as far as Video and Computer games go, I do not shy away from the violent ones. But  urlLink this  is just ridiculous. It does confirm my suspicians that the war was just entertainment for most Americans. I mean how many of us actually know someone in Iraq? Actually, I do. But for most of us there is a large degree of seperation between what happens to people in the news and what affects you. Our nation was at war for months, yet in America, you wouldn't be able to tell if it weren't for the newspapers or TV news.   I remember when Doom was called a  urlLink murder   urlLink simulator  - so I wonder what "good-natured" senators are going to have a hissy fit about this game? In Doom you fought monsters from hell, most far from human looking. All of those who talk about media bias (be it conservative, or liberal), you should take note. The news is a form of entertainment, the reality show of life. It is of course no more real than what producers choose to show you. My film teacher once told me: "Television is a sequence of lies that you believe to be true."     Murder Simulator? psh...  What you see and hear on television and the radio, or read in the newspapers is carefully chosen with one thing in mind: someone will watch, read, listen or buy it. The news is a consumer product. This of course will not be news to anyone who's paid any attention to the world. People often blame the media for the ills of their society. They see the violence in a game their children are playing, or a move they saw. They then connect that to the violence they hear about on the news. Our movies are violent, cause our culture is violent. We are violent. No one needed to see a movie to learn how to kill someone, we've been doing that thousands of years before we ever had televisions.  ~Ben

      Hey, I suppose this is my first post. So to whomever will actually read this, hello. I wasn't sure if I was going to create this today, or ever, really. But since I couldn't sleep I figured I'd do something semi-constructive. First was applying for jobs, second was creating this blog.   So for a start, a little about me: I am a 23 year old male who lives in the  urlLink Chicago  area. I will be attending  urlLink graduate school  this fall, but would prefer gainful employment. That, however, doesn't seem to be working for me. So for the moment, school it is. I have a B.S. in Computer Science, and that is exactly what it is: BS. I've been working an extremely boring job devoid of anything intelligent to do at the  urlLink university  I graduated from. When you graduate from school, you're supposed to leave, and I still haven't. I'm slightly ashamed of that.   I play guitar, write crappy songs, watch movies, and spend way too much time online in my freetime.   So that's a little about me. So what should you expect if you stop by? Mostly me bitching, probably. I cannot gurantee it will be entertaining, but at least it'll be something.  ~Ben

       Jesus: The Virgin Mary a "Frigid Bitch"    In the urlLink  diaries  Jesus calls the Virgin Mary a "frigid bitch", and describes his experiences of taking marijuana and LSD and having sex with Mary Magdelene.   Now this sounds like my kind of book. I do agree that god must have a sense of humor I mean, look at the platypus for chrisake.  There are way too many reactionary christians that get offended way too easily. First reaction of course is to ban the book! Ban ideas that are different than our own. Insanity. If you don't like the book don't read it, no one is forcing you.  In the mean time, at least admit it's funny...

       Is David Blaine Insane? Probably....     I do like that picture though. So apparently this nutty 'magician' (as if there were such a thing) decided to lock himself up in a glass box and suspend it over London. Why? No one knows?  Apparently urlLink  Londoner's  are doing everything from flashing their breasts at him, to throwing sausages and bacon.  Suppose he could fast himself for something more useful..like a cause?  But hey if Sky news were paying me to sit in a glass box for 44 days, I might do it too.

      So what happens when mutli-billion dollar corporate trade entities don't have enough money? They  urlLink sue  12 year old girls for more. The industry continues to blame 'internet piracy' for their declining sales, while not looking at the fact that just maybe their music just really sucks, and that's why no one buys it.   As usual,  urlLink The Register  sums it up best:  "Brianna thought the $29.99 fee her mother paid for the Kazaa music trading service entitled her to download songs at will. Nothing like a lawsuit seeking $150,000 per song to correct that misconception. This is what some refer to as a growing pain.   This settlement has taught us a few valuable lessons about the RIAA's methodology. Apparently, young teens hit the copyright infringement scale at the $2,000 mark. College students, by contrast, must cough up between $12,000 and $17,000 for their violations, as we saw earlier this year. So any parents out there with children under 12 can expect their precious tots' crimes to cost around $1,000. That's comforting."

        urlLink Liberals need to lose the hypocrisy and realize old traditions are still important     I would like to complement Nick Arhos in his recent column written in regards to liberals and their ideas.   His article really captures the overpopulation of the liberal presence on campus. I believe he is correct in his statement, “Liberals also refuse to acknowledge the overwhelming evidence that the United States is a Christian nation founded upon laws derived from the Holy Bible and the Christian faith.”   The Alabama Supreme Court situation makes me sick. Our laws, that the Supreme Court enforces, are based on the Ten Commandments (thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, etc.). Those tablets have a place in the courts.   I also would like to voice my approval in his statement exploring the hypocrisy in many liberals’ beliefs. I am tired of complaints about SUVs and gas costs. Unless these individuals are riding a bike or walking, they have no place in harassing vehicle drivers.   Do I classify myself as a conservative or Republican? No, I consider myself a citizen of the United States of America: In God we trust.   Joshua Huseman  Junior, communication   Normally, I do not like to participate in the name-calling and misinformation that is modern political discourse. However, the complete lack of historical knowledge of this nation by Joshua and Nick is amazing. Firstly, if the United States is a christian nation, what denomination is it? Christians among themselves cannot decide on a set of beliefs to all agree on, so it seems unlikely one denomation would be favored over another. Then there is this document that the nation was founded upon, the constitution. The constution doesn't even make a mention of god, or christianity, even in general. Although it does mention religion, right in the first amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;."  To argue that our nations laws are based on the 10 commandments is nonsense. Firstly, I don't remember there being a federal law forbidding from using God's name in vain. Further, it is not illegal for me to worship or create an icon.   more later...  Ben

      Heard this new song just the other day and it summed up the moment perfectly, i like it a lot.  The Postal Service - Such Great Heights:   I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles In our eyes are mirror images and when We kiss they're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate that God himself Did make us into corresponding shapes like Puzzle pieces from the clay True, it may seem like a stretch, but Its thoughts like this that catch my troubled Head when you're away when I am missing you to death When you are out there on the road for Several weeks of shows and when you scan The radio, I hope this song will guide you home  They will see us waving from such great Heights, 'come down now,' they'll say But everything looks perfect from far away, 'come down now,' but we'll stay...  I tried my best to leave this all on your Machine but the persistent beat it sounded Thin upon listening That frankly will not fly. you will hear The shrillest highs and lowest lows with The windows down when this is guiding you home

      Mar's had a  urlLink sea  (of water!)!  I'm not a person that deals with change well. And for a person that doesn't deal with change now, there have been a lot of changes in my life in the past year. I guess I'm not sure what I fear, if anything, other than change itself. I get comfortable in my routines - to a fault. But I actually get used to new routines rather easily, just makes me uncomfortable.   Anyhow.  Places I want to go to:     urlLink Japan  (Tokyo! I think I've always wanted to go to japan..) My studying in Japan kind of got put on hold since I got a job,  I still plan on doing it however, so Perhaps I should not get used to an extravagant lifestyle!    New Zealand (Looks beautiful and interesting, and more fun that Australia!)    India (Taj Mahal! Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi)    Spain(a friend keeps telling me how great it was there, over and over, and over... ;))    Egypt(Pyramids of course... and the Sphinx)    Ireland(who doesn't wnat to go to ireland?)    England (Big ben, need i say more?)    China (Great wall, Hong Kong, Bejing..)   South Africa Morroco Argentina Mexico Florida! Alaska Norway Lithuania Poland Germany France Australia

       Bush pushed to Bomb Iraq after 9/11    After the president returned to the White House on Sept. 11, he and his top advisers, including Clarke, began holding meetings about how to respond and retaliate. As Clarke writes in his book, he expected the administration to focus its military response on Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. He says he was surprised that the talk quickly turned to Iraq.   "Rumsfeld was saying that we needed to bomb Iraq," Clarke said to Stahl. "And we all said ... no, no. Al-Qaeda is in Afghanistan. We need to bomb Afghanistan. And Rumsfeld said there aren't any good targets in Afghanistan. And there are lots of good targets in Iraq. I said, 'Well, there are lots of good targets in lots of places, but Iraq had nothing to do with it.   "Initially, I thought when he said, 'There aren't enough targets in-- in Afghanistan,' I thought he was joking.   "I think they wanted to believe that there was a connection, but the CIA was sitting there, the FBI was sitting there, I was sitting there saying we've looked at this issue for years. For years we've looked and there's just no connection."   Clarke says he and CIA Director George Tenet told that to Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Attorney General John Ashcroft.   Clarke then tells Stahl of being pressured by Mr. Bush.   "The president dragged me into a room with a couple of other people, shut the door, and said, 'I want you to find whether Iraq did this.' Now he never said, 'Make it up.' But the entire conversation left me in absolutely no doubt that George Bush wanted me to come back with a report that said Iraq did this.   "I said, 'Mr. President. We've done this before. We have been looking at this. We looked at it with an open mind. There's no connection.'     urlLink http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/19/60minutes/main607356.shtml   Unbelievable.

       Violence begets Violence.   Something I learned while I was still young. Something that Israel, or the Palestinians have learned. Terrorism is generally regarded as a dispicable act. Strap a bomb to yourself and take out as many of the "enemy" as possible - often times civilians. But all warfare is horrible. To condemn assymetrical terrorism as a crime against humanity, and yet not "conventional" warfare, seems downright hypocritical. Does not the seemingly random bombing and missleing of Palestinians terrify them? Is it not itself a form of terrorism? To make the people of Palestine - those who are fighting - submit to the wishes of the Israelis? Isn't that the definition of warfare - make one side submit by force. It would seem that the end's of the would-be terrorists aren't irrrational - they just want their homes. Some of the more radical groups want the destruction of Israel - but that seems to be the fringe groups. Most of the Palestinians want what every person on this planet wants, peace, and a place to live.    What's left of the Hamas leader. What was widely unreported was that he was wheelchair bound...  This situation can most easily be put upon the British, amoung other nations (however it was the British who occupied the area which is called Palestine and Israel now), that decided to make a homeland for the Jewish people displaced by Hitler and his indescrible act of inhumanity. The British gave up, and handed it over to the newly formed United Nations to handle. The land was divided and Israel was formed, and it was immediately at war with several Arab countries. Israel ended up conquering land from Palestine, and Egypt too.  Why the United States decides to take sides in the conflict (the Israelis) is unknown to me other than political reason - to have a strong ally in the middle east which doesn't like the US much (and the irony is lost on me, one of the reasons they don't the US is because of our support for Israel).   The Palestinians are fighting back in the only way they can. They have no armies, no tanks, no aircraft. The Israelis have American tanks, american weapons, american aircraft. This military support is fueling as what is seen as a largely one sided conflict. The Israelis moving deeper into Palestinian territory, and bulldozing homes; the palestinians fighting back with suicide bombings, and the Israelis retaliating.  The palestinians won't stop their bombings until the Israelis pull back, the Israelis won't stop retalliating (by shooting missles into crowds of people to get "terrorist leaders"!?), or pull out until the palestinians stop bombing. So its a vicious circle of violence, with no end in sight.    urlLink US running scared...

      One sign that you may be doing something that is wrong - world wide protests!    Hong Kong.  I remember being educated all my life about how great the United States of America is. "We're the greatest nation in the world!" Why? Is it because of all the nations we've "freed"?   One of the factors leading to radical terrorists is our propensity to overthrow governments we don't like. This is why I was against going to war with Iraq. We were playing right into the hands of Al Queda. The suffering of the Iraqi people was great, but no greater than what the United States has incured against other peoples by supporting even more terrible dictatorships.     Kashmir.  I attended a talk about the morality of the United States invasion of Iraq at Benedictine University. It was the typical catholic "just-war" theory stuff. But there was one very interesting moment. The only Iraqi to attend - someone from the audience stood up and said (during the q & a session): "I find it absolutely hypocritical that you would all talk about the evil regime of Saddam Hussein, all the while it was the you who had put him into power, supported him, gave him the weapons of mass destruction. Then you sit here and debate the human rights issues of government."   I am paraphrasing of course. But this put the whole room into shock. And I am glad he said it. It is hypocritical. Our nation is warring contradiction. Freedom for all, as long as you're american, or have oil, and only if we can't get along with you're autocratical government or replace it easily.    The Philippines  Now, you may think I'm a looney here. What other nations has the United States government overthrown? I haven't read about this in history class? Well, no you haven't. Or rather it's there - between the lines.    Turkey.  Here is a short list (made short as I'll only list nations after WWII ended):  Iran (overthrew their democratically elected government no less, because their president was going to nationalize their Oil company! OH NO Socialism!!!) South Korea Guatemala Vietnam Cambodia Zaire Brazil Dominican Republic Haiti Cuba Indonesia Chile Greece Nicaragua Greneda Libya Panama Iraq Afganistan Yugoslavia  this isn't even a full list.   One suggestion for the future. STOP. MESSING. WITH. OTHER. PEOPLE'S. GOVERNMENTS. That pisses them off!   I think we can eventually restore respect to this nation, may take a long time though.    London.   We are, along with the world, are the victims of our own foriegn policy.

       Bleu Bleu, something new for you.  I gots me a new a job. So long to my old place of not so gainful  urlLink employment . About all I'll miss is the people, really. Lots of memories there. But time to create new memories in new places.   I was thinking today, that I think I will be a teacher - at least for a little bit. Watching the professor that (as of this second)  I still currently TA for, completely lose the class over and over again - made me really want to take over and teach the class.  My current plan, finish my masters. Go teach somewhere and get my PHD. Marry some great girl (perhaps Jewel will be availible?) Work for Nasa, go to Saturn, then die a happy man with 10 kids.

      i can't put into words the beating and relentless thoughts of my head that constantly bombard all that i am and if i could write all i thought or knew im pretty sure i'd either be damn smart or completely insane. most likely the latter... i know that for about a day 4 months ago i actually thought i would have everything i ever wanted, but it slipped away, like most things.  as Eddie says "hearts and thoughts, they fade, fade away..." I guess nothing is permanent, but I'd think that at least I'd be happy for more than a day. But reality then sets in. and then the possibility of that i may never have what i really want out of life. Who am I to expect that anyhow...

I have a new one though....much better than my old one. so perhaps i'll delay judgement until then.  that old beaten up room still holds memories for me though, and its hard to leave it on one level.  strange life, strange days, strange air  now, my recurring back pain is getting much worse. some days i feel completely debilitated. probably moving all my stuff yesterday didnt help anything either.

      insanity. absolute insanity.  Want to stop viruses?  urlLink Execute  the writers. That's write exectue someone who writes a virus. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Now you will go to  urlLink jail  for up to 3 years in italy for "downloading and uploading copyrighted content."   This is insane. People don't understand technology, the record and movie lobbyists are scared to death of it. Instead of changing their business to fit the new economy they want to  urlLink sue  people back into the old one.  A single mother sued for $540,000 - because her daughter downloaded some songs off of the internet is ABSOLUTE INSANITY. That is the worst abuse of corporate power I've seen in a long time.  Crime comparison:  Speeding ticket: 95$ (for speeding 95 in a 65 zone, I know I did this). Downloading one song in the United States and sharing it: 750$.  Let me ask you, what is the more dangerous activity?  What should our concern be? Why are we wasting time with this? We have terrorists that want to kill us, half the world angry with us, and we're wasting our time tracking down "music pirates"?? GIVE ME A FREAKING BREAK.   some days i wonder about this country.

      I now have a gmail account. Apparently, that's a  urlLink big deal . Now, if I knew I could sell it....  Well I gave my brother and Samreen the accounts. So lucky them. I have bestowed them great riches, or something.  It is pretty nice though. I like the way the page is setup - nice and simple. Its faster than yahoo or hotmail, and uncluttered. It organizes the email into "conversations," sort of like a messageboard.  Privacy "advocates" are having a field day - but they just prove they don't understand the technology. A computer looks for terms in your email and gives you relavent text ads. Though, I have yet to see a "relavent" text ad (pictures later..). That's it. Nothing sinister.   And you know what? You don't have to use it.  adios for now

      i guess i'm officially important now. I now get woken up in the morning whenever anything breaks, or looks broken. And thanks to the idiots who came before me, things break plenty.   So what to do? Fix it, I suppose. But I thought I was hired to program not babysit servers...

      I don't even have to wait 10 mins for a social engineering example!   Here is an email I recieved:    Dear U.S. Bank valued member,   Due to concerns, for the safety and integrity of the online    banking community we have issued this warning message.     It has come to our attention that your account information needs    to be updated due to inactive members, frauds and spoof reports.    If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and renew    your records you will not run into any future problems with the online service.  However, failure to update your records will result in account suspension.  This notification expires on May 20, 2004.     Once you have updated your account records your internet banking    service will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.     Please follow the link below    and renew your account information.     urlLink U.S. Bank Internet Banking        Hmm? I don't ever remember having a US Bank account? Is there such a thing? Sounds a little generic!  Now if we look at the source you see where the link really goes:  a href="http://203.131.92.146/www/" U.S. Bank Internet Banking   It seems, however, someone caught this and has disabled the website. But how many people went to that website and gave him their bank information?  I wonder..

      So what am i doing up at 6 am on a sunday morning?  to go to work. Some days I like my job, others - not so much.  So I thought perhaps I would bore you with some random thoughts, whoever it is that reads this.  A  urlLink flying car  is less of a gas guzzler than an SUV. Holy carp. (holy fish?)  Some of you may know, I am deeply interested in security, especially in the work place. I think I've read 5 or 6 books on the topic (starting my 7th and 8th). I don't think many people actually realize that the biggest security weakness are the people. If you call up and ask someone for information 9 times out of 10 they will give it to you. All you have to do is claim authority.  Any some good and interesting reads are:   urlLink Social Engineering Part 1   urlLink Social Engineering Part 2

      Have $200,000 and some time? Create a new virus. Or a cure for aids..  urlLink  http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,63441,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1     BERKELEY, California -- It took Adam Arkin and David Schaffer just $200,000 and a grad student to develop a potential treatment for AIDS. And that scares them.  That's because the therapy itself is a virus. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory assistant professors created a virus altered to latch onto HIV and mute its ability to become AIDS. They've tested the theory in a computer model and in cells in a dish. The results have been promising, and if they continue in that vein, the researchers could begin animal testing by the end of this year.  Arkin said this week at the International Biotech Summit at the University of California at Berkeley that it was almost too easy for him and his colleagues (Schaffer and then-grad student Leor Weinberger) to build the anti-HIV virus.  "If I can do it, anyone can do it," Arkin said.  "That's going to be a problem."     Understatement of the year?

      Odd. I don't post for a whole 10 days and WHAM the entire interface is different. Maybe I can change how my rather generic website looks.  Anyhow.  What Won't Happen but should: John McCain joining John Kerry and running for president. Vice-president is a rather useless role, but one that has been redefined by Dick Cheney. (Who really runs, or rather ruins this country). Bush admitting this war was an expensive mistake, in every sense of the word.   A good read:  urlLink http://www.indystar.com/articles/0/146292-3880-021.html   A note about Torture.  It seems some people aren't shocked by the torture of Iraqi prisoners. I can't believe that. We're supposed to be above that. Once we compromise our principles to fight the terrorists, we've lost. Not to mention WHY THE HELL ARE WE IN IRAQ? How many reasons have we be given? How many more will be fed? Why do we still accept them? It was a nice political spin that the talk of the missing weapons of mass destruction has completely left public debate. Now we're their to liberate the iraqi people - or are we there to torture them? So how are we bringing democracy to the middle east? By raping and torturing their people? There seems to be little mention that the prisoners that are at that prison are largely held there for no other reason that "looking suspicous."    urlLink http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2915028   War brings out the inhumanity in people. You can't establish a democracy for another people by force. It is something they must do themselves, it is something that we did ourselves (with a little help of the oft-forgotten french).  It will probably be a long and violent process - most revolutions are. But it'll be better than americans being over killing them, and "freeing" them (of their lives..).

      so there was an earthquake this morning. How strange.  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsUS/Quakes/uskgad.htm  I felt the building swaying, it was quite strange. I thought some lovers were getting a little into it upstairs (happened before), but then the swaying got stronger. I thought it strange, but since i've lived in a wooden house that swayed a lot before I lived in the apartment building, I didn't think much of it.  But then, John Im'd me.  [01:11:27] John: um [01:11:31] John: the ground just shook [01:11:37] me: you serious [01:11:41] me: it did here [01:11:43] me: wtf  [01:11:49] John: what the hell [01:11:50] me: i swear to god it just did here [01:11:59] John: it was like an earthquake [01:12:04] John: hehe [01:12:04] me: weird [01:12:10] me: or a nuke [01:12:16] John: ever been in an earthquake? [01:12:22] John: our computers wouldnt be working [01:12:40] John: nor would our eyes, skin, vital organs, peripheral organs...  Then Matt called me and told me the ground shook by him in Dekalb. It was quite freaky.  Anyhow, 4.5 earthquake is pretty good, but mild.

      Some of you asked what does "nani betsuni" mean? Well, it's japanese for "what? nothing!," well roughly, anyhow. It's for that annoying interaction with certain people, when you don't hear something they said and they say "nothing!," then you get really curious what it was they just said, since they just won't say it again.  I went to Great America yesterday. It decided to rain most of the morning though, and I got absolutely soaked. But we recovered, and went again later, with no rain, and waiting in line. I've never been on that many roller coasters in a row that quickly before. I was dizzy, and felt a little drunk afterwards. It's a bit strange, because I dont remember most of what happened, it's all a haze.  I have lots of memories there...strange ones, nice ones, and bad ones. They were pretty much haunting me all of yesterday. It's funny how sometimes you can't get certain things or people out of your mind, i just keep replaying the moments, and i really dont want to remember or forget at the same time. That's been the last 4 years. In one sense i want to forget them in another I want to remember them.  every couple of months my dreams change, well some of them. Others stay the same, and I can't shake them. I keep having this recurring dream of the past, then waking up, realizing the moment is gone, and lost forever. So I have to live through all the sadness again, and I'm not sure why my brain is relentless in its self-torture.  more and more i just come to the conclusion i live in a fantasy world most of the time, and when i come back to the real one, i get really sad, then fall back to my fantasy that will in reality never be fufilled.  i never much liked the real world anyhow

      The creator of the algorithm, and my profession:   Al-Khwarizmi From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi (أبو عبد الله محمد بن موسى الخوارزمي in Arabic), also called Muhammad ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, Muhammad ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi, and Mohammad Bin Musa Al-Khawarizmi, (flourished early 9th century), was a Persian scientist, mathematician, and author. He may have been born in 780, or around 800; he may have died in 845, or around 840.  He was born in the town of Khwarizm (now Khiva), in Khorasan province of Persia (now in Uzbekistan). The name al-Khwarizmi means the person from Khwarizm. His family moved soon afterward, to a place near Baghdad, where he accomplished most of his work in the period between 813 and 833. There are various guesses at his native languages, including Persian or more probably Khwarizmian (now dead). All of Al-Khwarizimi's works were written in Arabic.  He developed the concept of the algorithm in mathematics (which is a reason for his being called the grandfather of computer science by some people), and the words "algorithm" and "algorism" come from Latin and English corruptions of his name. He also made major contributions to the fields of algebra, trigonometry, astronomy, geography and cartography. His systematic and logical approach to solving linear and quadratic equations gave shape to the discipline of algebra, a word that is derived from the name of his 830 book on the subject, Hisab al-jabr wa al-muqabala (حساب الجبر و المقابلة in Arabic).  While his major contributions were the result of original research, he also did much to synthesize the existing knowledge in these fields from Greek, Indian, and other sources. He appropriated the place-marker symbol of zero, which originated in India, and he is also responsible for the use of Arabic numerals in mathematics.  Al-Khwarizmi systematized and corrected Ptolemy's research in geography, using his own original findings. He supervised the work of 70 geographers to create a map of the then "known world". When his work became known in Europe through Latin translations, his influence made an indelible mark on the development of science in the West: His algebra book introduced that discipline to Europe and became the standard mathematical text at European universities until the 16th century. He also wrote on mechanical devices like the clock, astrolabe, and sundial. His other contributions include tables that included trigonometric functions, refinements in the geometric representation of conic sections, and aspects of the calculus of two errors     urlLink http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi    P.S. wikipedia rules.

              We are as the flute, and the music in us is from thee;         we are as the mountain and the echo in us is from thee.             We are as pieces of chess engaged in victory and defeat:         our victory and defeat is from thee, O thou whose qualities are comely!             Who are we, O Thou soul of our souls,         that we should remain in being beside thee?             We and our existences are really non-existence;         thou art the absolute Being which manifests the perishable.             We all are lions, but lions on a banner:         because of the wind they are rushing onward from moment to moment.             Their onward rush is visible, and the wind is unseen:         may that which is unseen not fail from us!             Our wind whereby we are moved and our being are of thy gift;         our whole existence is from thy bringing into being.    -  urlLink Rumi ,  urlLink Sufi  Poet About Sufism, which somewhat mirrors my beliefs...  Sufis believe that their teachings are the essence of every religion, and indeed of the evolution of humanity as a whole. The central concept in Sufism is " urlLink love ".  urlLink Dervishes  -- the name given to initiates of sufi orders -- believe that love is a projection of the essence of  urlLink God  to the  urlLink universe . God desires to recognize  urlLink beauty , and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God "looks" at itself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparent ugly, and to open arms even to the most evil one. This infinite tolerance is expressed in the most beautiful way, perhaps, by the famous Sufi philosopher and poet  urlLink Mevlana  (also known as    urlLink Rumi ) :  "Come, come, whoever you are. Worshiper, Wanderer, Lover of Leaving; ours is not a caravan of despair. Though you have broken your vows a thousand times...Come, come again, Come."

       I think a society totally motivated on greed, consumerism,  and materialism is a sick society.   I don't think that there can be a sufficient advancement in society until people generally care for each other. Despite all the great things about this country one its greatest assets - individualism - is one of greatests downfalls as well.   Because we are an individualistic society, there is an apathetic attitude among the general populace for anything but their individual lives. Hence the lack of participation in political systems of this nation. I think that most of us would be surprised if you asked the general population if they beleive that health care, and other social programs should be provided by the government - i think you'd find that answer would be yes. Yes, That is complete conjecture - but not unfounded, I am sure I could find a survey to back that up.        Ashcroft, who has performed an unprecedented power-grab as attorney general of the United States.    The part that disturbs me about the Bush administration is their psychotic, and odd politics. They are no longer for less government (as government has grown dramatically under the Bush administration), they continually attempt to claim more and more executive power (although this has been a general presidential trend), and are for further government interference in the general lives of the people (the amendment to outlaw gay marriage, institutionalized discrimination). The only thing they have done remotely conservative is - ramp up the nationalism of this nation and cut taxes. The rest have been very un-conservative moves.   I'm for less government involvement generally, and especially in areas that will hurt the general populace. I believe that a national or state based health care system is badly needed. I believe that we should leave other nations to self-determination, with the exception of actual self-defense. The interventionalism of the past 50 years has created more problems than it has solved.   And most importantly - there is no one way to solve a problem. Not all liberal ideas are correct, not all conservative ideas are correct. I think this is a point most of you are missing, there are multiple ways to solve a problem - because that is generally what we're trying to do - solve problems.   These are more or less my observations.

       urlLink A Good Read or rather depressing.                     So I might be a terrorist, but I’m not completely sure; I’m still waiting for the government to let me know. Like many Orange Countians—150,000, give or take—I fit the description of a possible terrorist. What’s that exactly? Does she walk around with a .38 Smith & Wesson, slaying heathenish infidels? Nope. Does her normal wardrobe include an "I [heart] Osama" T-shirt? No way; I tossed that out with my "I [heart] the New Kids on the Block" shirt ages ago. Does she conveniently create fictitious wars around election years? Not me.        I don’t feel like a terrorist, but who am I to question the sophisticated methods used in our nation’s counterterrorism agencies, as infallible as our nation’s leaders. With new, cutting-edge advancements in technology, today’s terrorists can be easily tracked down based on two factors: their last name and their country of origin. Forgive me, Big Brother, for I, having the last name of "Afghani" and my father being from, well, Afghanistan have thusly sinned twice. My being Muslim is simply an added bonus.        My family was contacted last August via post card—I suppose our Morse Code machine must have been down at the time. The piss-colored post card was addressed from Detective Boyd of the Los Angeles Police Department and asked us to "PLEASE CONTACT."         My father, the original Afghan in the family, had the honor of placing the call to the Anti-Terrorist Division at the LAPD. The conversation between my father and the detective basically resulted in the understanding that we, the Afghani family, were on some sort of a list that their highly developed computers had created. The detective wanted us to set up a meeting with him sometime in the near future. Where? Well, it seems the preferred meeting place for police and enemies of the state can now be found at your local coffee shop—doughnuts were not discussed.             urlLink Read the rest here

      one step further to a dictatorship?  Tom Ridge wants to  urlLink suspend the election  if there is a terror attack.   The better solution would be to make the election several days, instead of just one. That way an attack one day wouldn't make sense - it wouldn't be as disruptive. Not to mention that the election shouldn't just be held on one WEEKDAY. (Making it difficult for most normal working people to make it to the polls).  Ben

      the media is like a single mind. When one newspaper writes something, the next one has to write something about it too. So when you check the various news papers/TV/websites you find they all have the same stories - details may be different but the news is always the same. They all seem to miss the same things, then they all seem to make the same mistakes.   urlLink For Example :  What most (nearly all) people fail to realize is that sending email is more analogous to sending a post card than it is to sending a letter. Since all emails are sent through the network and internet in clear text and can be easily read. If you don't want people reading your email - you should encrpyt it.   Not to say that I am in favor of government wiretaps of internet connections. One just has to be pro-active about security.

      A really good  urlLink article .  I've been trying to make this point to people for a while:  We're better than torture. We know better. We have laws - a supreme law - the constitution.  If we give up our values, to fight a war - then we've lost. If we torture someone to get information, we've sunk to the level of the terrorists - we've become the terrorists.   How do you win a war against an enemy that knows no boundaries, that recruits a new member everyday, who doesn't have any problem beheading innocent people?    You be better than them. You cannot every fully defeat idealogy, but you can make it obsolete.

      I'm a fan of  urlLink Lawrence Lessig , who is a law professor at  urlLink Stanford Law School  (which is where I would go, when I go to law school. I think I'd like to do that one day...). He used to teach at the  urlLink University of Chicago Law School , with  urlLink Barak Obama  (someone else I'm a fan of).  Lawrence has an interesting  urlLink article  in  urlLink Wired  (my favorite magazine to read):   In August, Robert Greenwald will release an updated version of his award-winning film,  Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War . Greenwald has added a clip of President George W. Bush's February interview with Tim Russert on  Meet the Press , NBC's Sunday morning talk show. In the clip, the president defends his decision to go to war - astonishingly unconvincingly.  Greenwald asked NBC for permission to run the one-minute clip - offering to pay for the right, as he had done for every other clip that appears in the film. NBC said no. The network explained to his agent that the clip is "not very flattering to the president." Greenwald included it anyway.      and       This question is crucial, and thus Greenwald has decided to defend his fair use right, even if it means staring down a bunch of lawyers in court. The argument: It's hard to tell "the whole truth" about the Iraq war when you censor bits of that truth because a network tells you to. But what this incident demonstrates most is what many increasingly fear. Concentrated media and expansive copyright are the perfect storm not just for stifling debate but, increasingly, for weakening democracy as well.     This does mark a disturbing trend...    And one of the reasons why i like Obama:   "There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America - there's the United States of America."  - Barak Obama at the Democratic National Convention.

      here i am heading to san francisco, with another person named erik( urlLink eric ). This time I have a feeling it will be less fun, however. At least I won't accidently be on a flight to Alaska this time. Which, by the way, isn't on the way to SF.  Sometimes, I think it's worse not to know, than to think about the possibilities. But I think, that is my flaw. Because my life is all possiblities. Where do I go? What do I do? They're more or less - all my choices.  My biggest goal in life is to have a family, and to be a better father than my own. And I'm sure I've found the person I want that with. The problem with primary goals is when they include people who have their own lives, and their own goals. I was never good at that. Sometimes, I like to think to myself how I've never gotten what I've wanted. Perhaps, I should think rather, that I've never wanted what I've gotten. And I wonder about the things I've done to be in this position. I know she is right. Only thing is, it feels like everything is closer than it is, and I have to be reminded that Christmas doesn't come this year. Especially for someone who's done what I've done. But I've learned how quickly one can descend into weakness. I don't want to be there again either. So comes possibly the hardest thing I've ever done. Letting go. Either it'll come or it won't. One of my major faults is forcing something when I'm frustrated - to make it work - instead of patience and a steady heart. Whether or not things work out the way I want them to - is ok. There will be tomorrow, other people, other things.  It helps, not to be so self absorbed. But I think that I'm often a poor observer. I'd like to think I wasn't always caught up in my head...but I am. Perhaps its the caffiene, or my nuttiness.  There is this baby boy in the seat ahead of me, his kind, new eyes staring back at me. How can't you help but stare back? The little girl across from the aisle is playing with her cat, entertaining the boy. Sometimes the people are more entertaining than the movie...  Another flight back to the west coast. Not for long enough. Even thought it feels like my heart is being stretched like a rubberband from San Fransisco to Chicago.  So i pray now and forever that I can be the person that I want to be, and need to be. That those around me can forgive my sins, that God can too. That despite my wrongs, that he will have enough mercy on me to let me achieve my happiness, and let it not be at the expense of someone elses.  So, I guess you are right, Sammie, tears are my muse. They aren't tears for me though, I won't cry for me anymore. I've been blessed, and i think it's tough to see, because I can readily see everything that's wrong - instead all that's right.
