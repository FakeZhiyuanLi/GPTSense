      It's been a few days. I haven't had much to say really. Except I've missed a friend.  I was thinking about what I'm going to do with some of my charcters. I do have a SL (storyline, for all those that aren't in the know) I can try to run but I'm not sure how I'm going to start it off.   Time will tell I guess. Besides I need to talk to the other SOPs about it.

      Ah the wonders of being an SOP.  Today we had to tell a good player that he was losing his position as a rep....it wasn't fun.

      Yesterday was Father's Day.   What did I do? For my Dad a simple "I love you." For my husband..well that's private.  I love my father deeply. I couldn't have had a better man raising me or loving me. He's the stick I measure all men up to. I married a man much like my father in views and temperment. I'm proud of my father, he's worked hard all his life to provide for our family. I can't say that my father is proud of me... that hurts some. Disappointing my father always hurt me more than when I ended up getting spanked for some transgression.  My father often told us stories of his younger life. How hard it was, how he wanted so much better for us. I heard about alcoholic step fathers..yes, fathers. I heard about his grandmother raising him and the love in his voice when  he spoke of her. I even heard of his tours in Vietnam. He felt it was important to pass down even those stories to us, my brother and I.  "Someday you are going to have to remember these. They are your history and mine. Good, bad and inbetween, girl.  Don't ever forget and don't ever let me forget....if the time comes." ~~~ Wayne Evans, my father.  I love you Daddy.

      Well this weekend went pretty fast. Typical Sunday table top game that was just short of being totally boring. Only because I'm rather burnt out on D&D at the moment. I really have to say though that this time around the DM did a pretty good job considering.  I play TT twice a week on Fridays and Sundays. They can run the gamut of D&D to Cyberpunk to whatever catches the player's eye for the week. I like the variety and it's different than online irc roleplaying chats. You get the occasional dickhead but usually all it takes is for the party to kill their character once before they get the idea. They either pack up and leave or they adapt.  I've been roleplaying for 17 years now. I started at the tender age of 15. You learn a few things along the way in all those years. Like how to make good survivability choices  for your character.. when to run...when to fight...when to beg for your life. Of course with some you have a character who would make a stupid decision, you just have to know how to get said character out of the hole they dig themselves into. This includes knowing when to put pride aside and do what you must. Anybody who has a character that isn't able to adapt has a character that has a built in timer that will eventually go off and say -DONE-. I love seeing some player come up with a saying like "He would NEVER do that" I just have to play devil's advocate and say ....never?? never ever??  It's fun to play with those, they tend to die quick but you can use them as efficient cannon fodder until such time as they expire because their character "just wouldn't do that."

      After spending a good chunk of time on this thing and my webpage to figure it all out. Then time with the hubby (that's husband for those that don't know). I'm tired. Soon to be fixed as fast as I can get some coffee down me. Ahhhhhhhhhh coffee, nectar of the gods.....usually.

      Okay okay I gave in to peer pressure!! Forgive me. Really I just needed to see if I could do this. Cause when it comes to html and junk like that I suck...I'm not kidding. I'm not even going to tell you how long it took me to put this all together. All I can say is it's because of sheer determination.

       Interesting Bit Of Stuff   Ever have a church group show up at your door and try to give you the "Good News"? Isn't it just so Annoying?  Here's a few questions to throw back at them as they try so hard to get you to change your faith.  The questions follow unchanged from their original authoring. Under no circumstances will "The LORD works in mysterious ways" or other arguments in that vein be acceptable. If a question does not apply to your particular sect, explain why.  1. If your god did not want Adam and Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, why did he put the tree in the garden of Eden (and at the center, no less)? Was it for shade? If so, why use something so dangerous as a shade tree? If the purpose of the tree was to tempt Adam and Eve, explain why it's OK for your god to engage in a practice that our modern-day courts of law refer to as "entrapment."  2. Why is it that the life of Jesus was so similar to the lives of pagan Christs, particularly Herakles, Dionysios, Mithras and Asklepios?  3. Do you feel that the last words of Christ were significant? If so, why do the four gospels attribute three different sentences to Christ as his last? (Matthew 27:46 and Mark 15:34: "My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?"; Luke 23:46: "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit"; John 19:30: "It is finished").  4. If your sect considers the King James Bible to be the official and/or authoritative translation, justify this in light of the fact that when King James commissioned his translation to be poetic rather than accurate. How can you possibly use an inaccurate translation as your reference for what is/is not the word of your god? If your sect does not use the King James Bible, what translation do they use? Justify the use of that particular translation  These are just a few things to say to those that come knocking on your door wishing to change your particular faith. ( My pardon to my Christian friends.... this is all meant as a joke and to get a few laughs. Perhaps if people think about their religion they'll be less like sheep and make more intelligent choices.)

        What I thought I  Would Never See    Didn't think she'd come back. Interesting that she has. Could she just not stay away?   I fade more and more from IRC. Miss it, but far less than I ever thought I would. Why play? Why be around? There is nobody but a handful that even notice or want to do more than sit and stare at a screen. I'm restless. I want ......something.

       Another Two Down   I had Phedre taken from the Sabbat list, and then posted upon the VH forum that I want Han`ia removed from the Gangrel clan list. Hard to see them go? Amazingly not.  I made a realization today. I feel less and less motivated to stay on irc now that I'm not an op. I was going on most often because I felt a duty to be around as an op. Really only stay on to talk with a few friends, if they are busy...oh well. If there is no roleplay? Take off and see what's on TV or something. Why stay? Why lurk? Just what am I missing?   Nothing.  Wow... what a thought. I don't need to be on. I don't want to be on. Well... I do but as soon as I see nothing is happening. I leave. I miss the way it used to be, but you can't roll back time.

       ST Marathon   I've been running this SL, Tears of Nidaba. To be honest so far I'm very happy with how it's been turning out. It's taken some wierd directions at times but they've only made the SL better I think. I haven't heard any complaints yet. Though they might all just be a little polite about it.  Adjusting it for table top was hell....... there are things you can do in one and not the other. If anybody likes mythology they'll probably like this SL.

       My Two Cents   Well I finally put down my words....wonder what the fall out will be. I almost hope somebody bitches. I would welcome it in fact. It's almost gotten to the point where I don't even want to play in the hall. I made a promise though...and for him and the few others that really matter I'll stick around. That's it though.

       Sick   I've been really sick these last few days. Well sick isn't the word, my blood pressure has been up and I just can't get rid of a headache. I slept most of yesterday and today. It's been unusual, the sleeping part.  Perhaps this is the reason for my earlier blahs on IRC.  On the brighter side. I'm starting to feel better.

       Things That Tick  You Off   There are somethings that just need talked about. I really don't care who sees it either. I've let myself stew about it and now I want to write about it. A while back  urlLink this  post was made. Now at the time I was leaving as an SOP and such and of course this person couldn't let things lie. No she  just had to dredge things up and cause a bigger stink. I made a simple post, all of 4 words.    What she points out are things she complained about before things were changed and now she wants it back to the way it was when she was bitching about the very system she says we try.  One word.  MORON  God that feels good. What it is with people? They don't understand the simplest concepts?

       The Blahs   Yes it's the case of the blahs. At least for IRC anyway. I can't say the same for my drawing.   WOW  Three pieces in as many days. I haven't been in a frenzy like this in a long time. The problem is that I can't think or do anything but this till it's out of my system so to speak. It really annoys the man at times. I really want to start painting again. I do alot of watercolor but never think they are good enough to scan in and show off. I'm picky like that.   --Roleplaying Section--  I will be gradually adding stat sheets for each character. All of my vampire characters listed are on IRC. However I'll be using typical VtM in making their sheets. Yes I actually have sheets for them.   --Webpage Stuff--  I will be adding links to my favorite ppl upon this page soon. Yes, I'm lazy. I should have done it earlier, but what the hell. I'm riding this wave of activity for all it's worth.

       Changes II   Finally completed the change over completely. I will be adding more art and such really soon. Doing it while I'm in the mood is the trick. I love the design aspects of doing webpages but I could do without the coding. I'm more interested in how it "looks" rather than the content. If you like this tell me!! I like having feedback.  Dal Net is still a bitch. *sigh*  Tiscali seems the only server up. Which is a real pain cause it's laggy as hell sometimes.   urlLink Krysil

       Changes   Well I think I've found what I've wanted in a basic look. Now all it takes is some tweaking to fix. Really hope this turns out nice. I lik what I've done so far but who knows with me it can change at a moments notice. They never told me coding would be such a pain in the ass. Fixing my title image has been harder than I thought, but so far it hasn't been anything that I can't work through.   On another note I can't get on to Dal Net. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!

      Completed yet another piece of art. Waiting. I rather like the look, the original is a photo from a magazine that I used for my pose. After doing my own drawing I scanned that in and played with it in psp.   Not too bad if I say so myself

      I just completed a bit of art. Wistful. It will be up on the art page soon When I get around to  doing it. Otherwise not much else is going on. I'm playing around as just a player in the hall. It's okay but not what I used to do. Dark Realm is.....interesting, that is if I can manage to get into the story lines they have running. No luck so far.

      It's been forever since I've written anything into this. I really didn't have anything to write. I took steps yesterday, removing myself from the SOPs list and resigning as the Toreador representative in a channel I've spent more than  5 years in.   Does it hurt? Yes  Do I regret it? I'm not sure yet.  Will I go back? I doubt it. There isn't anything to go back to.   It's been good guys. Fun for the most part. The stories, the play.....the people. I'll miss it, I can't deny that. It hurts leaving behind something I've worked hard on, but so much blood, sweat and tears into. Yes, I did my own share there. Withstood the name-calling, the cold shoulders and hurt feelings because I had a job to do.  I'll miss even that I think. I won't miss the stress the channel put me through.   Mik..... I'm sorry just to leave you in a lurch. Robbie..... I'm sorry you feel I was just patronizing you. Liam.... Have fun working with all the whiners, they aren't mine anymore.

       A Death.... and a loss that I'll feel for a long time   Catherine died....my oldest and Best character in #vampirehall. It hurts. That I lost her. Though I'm not angry just saddened to loose a character I've worked so hard on. So I cried my tears and dried them. Time to move on....time to put my effort toward another.   I'll leave with Catherine's song. She created it just for Mikal and it suits very well for this moment.  Gypsy's Heart    We've been through a lot, you and I. Depths of despair and joys so high. This one thing I give I know you'll cherish, This one thing I give I know won't perish.  I learned that freedom is in the heart. Sometimes I cannot stand being apart. Leaning on each other in times of need. What love has grown from this tiny seed.  When I think of you it's your... Gypsy's heart, roaming... (free) Gypsy's song, soaring... (free) That brings me tears... (Yes!) That soothes my fears... (Yes!) Your gypsy's heart beating next to me.....  Your gentle arms surround and protect, The warm, constant love you project. By birth it doesn't belong to me, But certainly my heart is, you see.  So different yet still so much the same Caring enough to ease each others pain. Letting our love be expressed We know it's stood up to the test.  Because of your... Gypsy's heart, roaming... (with me) Gypsy's song, soaring... (in me) Bringing me to tears... (Yes!) Soothing my fears... (Yes!) Gypsy's heart beating next to me  God knows what I'd do without your....  Gypsy's heart, roaming... (with me) Gypsy's song, soaring... (in me) Gypsy's heart beating next to me....  A Gypsy's heart beating ........ In me...

        More Questions....yippie   Just more questions because I've had a few people ask for them enjoy. :)  1. Explain why I should believe that your god is all-good when the only real information we have about him is the Bible, which clearly describes him as both good and evil. (See Isaiah 30:32, Luke 14:26, Numbers 31:17-18, Matthew 10:34, Amos 3:6, Deuteronomy 18:8, Deuteronomy 20:16, Exodus 20:5, Exodus 32:27, Isaiah 45:7, Psalms 52:5, Luke 22:36, and Jeremiah 18:11 for a small sample of Biblical passages which describe Jehovah as having an evil morality at times).  2. Explain why, if your god loves us all, more than half of us are going to Hell after we die. Specifically, refute or explain the following words of Christ, as presented in the New Testament: "Many are called but few are chosen," and "Straight is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto salvation, and few there be that find it." If your god loves all of us, couldn't he find a better way?  3. Explain why original sin exists. Why should I be eternally tortured for something that a pair of naked fruit-munching simpletons did in a garden over six thousand years ago? If you believe that children are born stained because they were conceived sexually, explain why I would be punished for something my parents did by your merciful and just god. If this does not apply to your sect, explain why.  4. If Jesus did have to die, why did someone (specifically, Judas) have to be damned in order accomplish the death and resurrection of Jesus? Jesus was at least a volunteer for the cross; I doubt that your god asked Judas if he was willing to go to Hell so that the resurrection could be accomplished.  5. If Judas was willing to go to Hell for humanity, didn't he make more of a sacrifice than Jesus, who spent only three hours in pain? Shouldn't we then be worshipping Judas?  Again this isn't to bash Christians at all since I too have my roots in the faith. Have fun.

       Some Thoughts   Recently I've been troubled about a few things. Vague fears that rest in the back of my mind. Oddly I can't voice them here, or anywhere for that matter. I'm not afforded any private place where I might rid my mind of these things. Express them without censure or risk of anger on some person's part.   I want to be able to rant and rave and yes that means sometimes I want somebody to give me a pat on the back and tell me it's going to be okay. Instead I'll hold these words in and seal them up like an oyster does with that bit of sand. Encase it in nacre and hope that some day I'll have a pearl of wisdom to hand down to my children or friends.  Still it's painful, irritating and stifling to my soul. Free spirit.... trapped? Yes, that's what it feels like. This isn't how I wanted my life to turn out. This isn't my dream. This is my reality and is it a wonder that I try so hard to lose myself in fantasy? To forget, for a brief time that I'm not what I wanted to be.  Don't get me wrong, this is my fault. I put myself here and I've only got myself to blame ultimately. I've dug the hole....now I just have to stop digging.  Where to?   .........where to?..........

        A New Job... A Good Time   I started a new job not long back and so far I like it alot. Despite it is telesales for the most part. The way they operate is really laid back and quite easy going.   Right now I'm in the Renewals department. I was originally in the AOL section (did not like it).  So far I've had a great time in renewals though. It's been fun and rewarding because I don't have to push this on people just ask if they would like it or not.  I'm not a really good salesman but I am good at being polite and courteous and that I figure is a big bonus in this section. Especially since I'm doing so well in it.   Wish me luck!!

       Storm Warning   Turn and look me in the eyes. Are you afraid of the storms in mine? Thunderous clouds and furious glances, Better look close storm warning sign. Strong enough to withstand my storms? The unknown depths and lightning tossed emotions. Uncharted territory that none have seen. These storms will test your devotions. Face forward into the wind driven rain. Endure the rising, angry waves. Seek further, till you reach the center. Just reach out and see what it saves. But careful of the storm warning. Seek safety and surcease. Cause this storm lashes out. All you can do is let it release.                                         ~Kristi Bowers

       Summoning   Passion rises, carried by flame  Flickering to kiss and consume  Bonfire before me, whispr'd my name  While above the full moon does loom  Chanting, chanting  I am incanting  Magick weaving  Bring my wish to being  Distant thunder speaks of power  Clouds gathered against mountain tops  God-fire lancing, making all but me cower  Its sudden flash then cool raindrops.  Chanting, chanting  I am incanting  Magick weaving  Bring my wish to being  The hiss of water on glowing coals  The mist of my breath in rain fall  While all feel the power deep in their souls  Lifting my voice to the clouds I call.  A summoning I seek from You  A payment in service I will do  Summon for me my other half  Winnow the grain from the chaff  Chanting, chanting  I am incanting  Magick weaving  Bring my wish to being  The world held still my prayerful plea  My spell the magick held its weave  Force of will and timing was the key  Reaching the heavens, answer to recieve  Chanting, chanting  I am incanting  Magick weaving  Bring my wish to being  It is done and begun  To see before a new sun  We answered your cry  In Our service will you strive  So it is again and always shall be  Soon beloved child, you will see  Chanting, chanting  I am incanting  Magick weaving  Brought my wish to being  Thunder once more filled the vaulted sky  Standing, emptied as the power flew  Shuddering with cold, tears in my eye  Deep within my heart I Knew  Chanting, chanting  I finished incanting  Magick weaved  And I believed   Kristi Bowers

       Contradiction    Tell me, just once  And make up your mind  Either I am damned or saved,  Take me along or leave me behind!   Come taste the moment  honey sweet or bitter  Come speak to me  in soft or sharp whispers  Contradiction is my name..my name   You tortued me still  You knew the choices  Blindly I climbed each hill  My love is still so clear  Though I can't hate you  Why ignore my tear   Come taste the moment  honey sweet or bitter  Come speak to me  in soft or sharp whispers  You lead me on this game..game   Tell me, just this once!  Why couldn't you look deep?  Kept me in the cold...  Between hope and the need to weep.  Come taste the moment   honey sweet or bitter  Come speak to me  in soft or sharp whispers  Lonliness is my name...my name   Kristi Bowers

      What to say?  Life goes on despite me wishing otherwise at times.    Money always seems the root of the problem these days. While there are varied reasons why my SO and I fight it seems the ones about money are the bitterest, the most hateful.  It's about control and my feeling the lack of it in my life. I'm stagnant again and it's something I hate. I'm my own worst enemy it seems.   Self-destruct.... tick tock tick tock--- When's the boom?  On a good note, my depression seems  under control. I refuse to allow myself to wallow in the feelings of despair. I look for other things to do.  Brent calls it avoiding the issue...he doesn't understand how hard I'm struggling to deal with them in the first place and how I'm unable to communicate my despair in a sufficient manner.  Life goes on. This one truth I have to remember.

      Once again it's been a long time since I've blogged anything at all. God, I'm terrible at this. Yet we'll try and see how I do from now on.  Recent events...  Play DAoC (Dark Age of Camelot) for those that don't know.....my wizardess finally made it to lvl 50! Took forever too!  Rp on mIRC (if you don't know what that is.....go search the web)  Other than that, paint, draw and basically read.

      Well once again it's been a long time since I've set my thoughts down. I'm awful at journaling, in part because I've never felt as if it were private. There was always my little brother and even my parents when I was younger and my beginning attempts were read by them at one time or another without my permission or approval.   Then there was my whole teenage years and I definitely learned the peril of keeping my thoughts down on paper. Much to my own shame and embarassment. These lessons were learned the hard way because what I write in the heat of the moment will usually fade or good sense will take over.   So..... here I am writing on this where anybody can come along and read it. Perhaps I feel a bit safer just because of the utterly public nature of this in the first place.  What am I going to write about?  I could start with my marriage.  This is my second attempt at matrimonial bliss....not that it's been very blissful. I can say this it's been 10 years...not all of it bad. There's been some reall hard times and some good times. Yet in many ways we seem to grow more distant. I feel more and more resentment. It's not that we argue all the time it's more like the same arguement over and over. I end up feeling like a child and the more he tries to control what and when I do things the more I rail and struggle.   I can stand outside myself and look at what's going on and yell at myself to just shut up but the words spill out.... words I know will continue the arguement. Lately I've had some success of curbing those words. Lately it's a smile I paste on my face. I've worked hard to get that far. Realizing my part in the continuation of the hostility.  I have to say that it's worked somewhat. It's helped that I've tried to be more understanding....or at least see his point of view.      Yet that's only the start......sometime I'm going to have to speak about my eldest daughter.

      Here I am once again.   Start the first day or real work tomorrow. Excited and a little nervous all in one I would have to say. We'll see how it goes. I'm eager though to really get going on this.  The schedule is a dream with two days working, one day off and two more working before finally two days off. I love this schedule....it's like having a two day work week. So first day like a Monday the next like a Friday...how can it get better?  Well I could get paid for doing even less,  heheeh.   I'm in a pretty good mood have been for the last week. Hope to stay that way too!  Wish me luck!

      It's frustrating.... I have a chance to visit a very good friend of mine, and I won't go.....all because I don't want to piss off the S.O. A week away... relaxing, away from man and kids just time for me and me alone.   I want.... but will deny myself. Curl further into my little shell.

       Tired...  &nbsp; It started out like a good day. Things seemed just fine, but I guess it wasn't to be. No sooner than I got up&nbsp; it turned to shit.&nbsp; The man, deciding that I haven't paid enough attention to him, elected to take all my stuff and put it up in the computer room.&nbsp; Movies.....clothes.....RPG books, anything he percieved as mine.&nbsp; Then busily tried to pick an arguement.&nbsp; I just ...closed down. His voice became nothing more than an annoying buzz. I was emotionless....too tired to cry.....to fight, to care. &nbsp; I'm frozen like a bug in amber. I can't move forward....I can't move at all. More and more I feel trapped into something the more and more he tears at me. Little pieces of myself fly off and I can never get them back again.&nbsp; What can I do? Three kids and me, no job.....no car that works. I can't even just pick up and leave. What person doesn't occasionally dream of the greener grass? &nbsp; I know it isn't true. It's hard which ever way I turn.&nbsp; I need to find myself again. I feel stuck inside a bloated body and chaotic emotions.&nbsp; I know I'm failing my children, not giving them the mother they deserve, yet feel powerless. Weak.&nbsp; No wonder I turn to games and chats with far away friends for comfort.

       Scouting Ahead...  &nbsp; The smooth slide of her arrow being pulled back felt almost pleasurable. The prey, an unsuspecting elf, was busy casting his spell against some other member of her realm. She didn't bother to look at who. Holding her breath she let the arrow go after taking careful aim and was satisfied as it buried itself deep into the elf's body. She barely realized that she'd already drawn a second arrow before it too was gone&nbsp; and the elf fell lifeless to the grass.&nbsp; A cruel smile touched her lips briefly as she aimed for another target. It was satisfying to watch the Hibernians scurry about in a panic. In a matter of seconds another fell, this time some hapless bard. As she was about to pick a third target she found there were no more.  &nbsp; "Raven you have absolutely no mercy, you got that bard right in the back." A tall highland Paladin, leader of this particular group chided. &nbsp; Ravenrede had to hold back the smirk of contempt at his words. "Only what she would have done herself to you. Or worse mesmerize you with her songs and while you smiled stupidly in wonder her friends would have cut you down." &nbsp; She shifted the bow to her shoulder while the Paladin tried to work up a comeback. "I'm going to scout ahead at the Hibernian Portal Keep. You'll get word from me if they decide to come back. " Her words curt and clipped.  &nbsp;

           Irritated...     &nbsp;  Ugh.... I just hate feeling this way. It seems that everything and everybody gets on my&nbsp;nerves. Kids, husband....friends. Nobody is exempt.&nbsp; The "can't help its" feeling where nothing sounds appealing. Talk about a&nbsp;pain.....     &nbsp;

      Another day... &nbsp; So far no luck in the job department. *mutter* However I have to continue to look forward.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Lately I've been playing my DAoC   I'm amazed at how well I'm doing so long as I have a group. Really enjoying the New Frontiers.&nbsp; Don't think I have much more to talk about today.&nbsp; Just not alot going on.

      I play around with a program called Terragen. These are some of my latest efforts. Now realize I have the free version which doesn't come with all the nice bells and whistles but I think I do a pretty good job.   ENJOY     And another:

      Once again....  Wow it's been a VERY long time. I'm so bad at this. Well what's new in life.    Don't have a job anymore. Don't you just love how you think everything is fine and you're doing a good job and then WHAM!!! Life kicks you in the teeth. Surprisingly I've recovered resonalbly well. Been looking for another job but it's sort of hit or miss.   I'm just going to smile and move on. No reason to shed tears over it....doesn't mean if it happens again I won't be falling apart but for now I'm glad I'm all together.
