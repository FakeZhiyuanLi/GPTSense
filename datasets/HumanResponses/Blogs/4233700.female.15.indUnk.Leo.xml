       Anniversary   okay   I dont know how to spell aniversary so i hope i spelled it rite but i probably didnt lol. Oh well, today is me and Brents 4 month anniversary but it sucks, because we cant hang out because I'm sick. I don't kno what i have. its weird, like for the past 4 days my mouth has gotten worse and my gums are all inflamed and i cant talk or eat, and im going to the doctors soon. lol yea i kno it sounds miserable bcuz it is. But anyway, I'm supposed to have band practice today at Grady's house ( our electric guitarist ) but i dont think i can sing if i cant even open my mouth. haha, BUT WHATEVER. i want new shoes. i'm craving a shopping spree...  hmmmm im bored and hungry. i need money. i need clothes. well, i have clothes. i need more. im a retard. im rambling. im a rambler. thats what i do. it happens sometimes. alot. i dont kno what to say. im bored. hungry. hot. like as in temperature. theres little bunny parts on my front porch. my cat ate the rest. i guess the feet dont taste very good. i've never tried it. man o man. i want the ashlee simpson cd. is that weird? shes pretty. i just died my hair yesterday. now its darker. alot darker. like, really dark. it looks good. i like it. i hate blonde hair. sorry if ur blonde. but its gay.

       Mom's Birthday      Today is my moms 42nd birthday...i got her a really pretty neclace and this cute scarf thing that im gona borrow lol. Yesterday afternoon i went to Brent's house...every time I see him it just reminds me of how awesome he is and how much I love him. Honestly, I can't even believe how lucky I am sometimes to have him. He just wants me to to be happy and he wants everything for me, I could never ask for anything better.       Sarah is in Florida for another few weeks or so, gawd!! It's like that old saying or whatever: you dont kno how special something is until its gone?? yah well, its TOTALLY that way with sarah. Not that I didn't kno she was special already lol. But I didn't realize how much I like, need her to be here and help me get through life. Like, all this hard and bad stuff has been happening while she's been gone and all i keep wishing for is that Sarah would be here to tell me it's all okay and get pissed at all the people that I should be mad at myself but I'm too chicken to get in any fights. Sarah's better at cussing people out anyway haha.       I'm leaving in a few hours until wednesday night. So i wont be writing til then.

       Camping      I just got back from camping yesterday...we left Winthrup early so that we could come home in time to watch the Olypmics, they were pretty cool but i was thinking that if i was there i'd feel stoned or something bcuz it was so dark and ceramic and weirded out but thats just me. Tomorrows my moms birthday and then tomorrow night im leaving again to go camping for another 5 days or something. My cousins are coming in from California. But anyway, what is it about summer that makes u feel like a loser if ur not doing anything? I mean, it should be okay for us to just stay at home by ourselves and just chill for a few days right? But then why do we all feel like such idiots if we're not hanging out with friends, or camping or out doing something productive, we dont have to be accomplishing something all the time right? Not that being by yourself isnt accomplishing something, but WHATEVER im just rambling like always. I never know how to say anything. But i think we should all just be okay with the fact that we're not gonna always hav something to do and that the world isnt going to leave us behind if we stop for a second to relax...
