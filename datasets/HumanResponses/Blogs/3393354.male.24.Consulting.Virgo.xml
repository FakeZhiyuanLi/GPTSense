      I've been getting more and more interested in the  urlLink Green Pary of Canada  lately.  Their policies seem very inline with my values and vision for Canada.  Importantly, I believe their economic policy to be sound: tax the bad things, subsidize the good.  I've actually put down my name as a volunteer.  Might be fun to get involved with a political party during this election period!

      I'm a big believer in the influence of chance encounters on one's life.  I feel like we are so powerless in the face of the great Random Dice that we throw every day.  Sometimes events seem to conspire against you.  Sometimes you feel you can do no wrong.  I think it's a kind of cyclical process.  You're 'luckiness' is always changing.  When things are going poorly, you really need to try to keep your eye on the big picture and have confidence that things will swing back the other way.  Over a long enough time horizon, things always tend to work out.  That said though, lady luck has certainly not been shining down on me these days.  With the demise of a fantastic relationship, and now an apartment that will put me in the poor house, I have little cause for being optimistic.  I will be moving in with new people soon however, and perhaps that will prove to be a fortuitous change of course for me.  Here's hoping that the chips start falling my way again soon.

      Went to see the Israeli film  urlLink Broken Wings  tonight. Quite enjoyed it.  Sad tale of a family that's been hit hard by the death of the father.  The movie begins nine months after the death, and the family is still in shambles.  Each of the kids, and the mother, breaks in a different way.  The movie follows them through some dramatic events that eventually help pull them back together.  Recommend it for rental.

      Thought  urlLink this  was a funny article about the final of the prequel trilogies.

      How appropriate the analogy of the Firebird, rising from the ashes to its once mighty strength and reclaim the victorious prize.  Indeed, ever since the regular season ended, the Calgary Flames have possessed that rare combination of grit, luck and composure that are worthy only of bygone championship teams.  Now recast as Canada's team, the Flames have a weighty mission ahead: to wrestle the league title out of American hands.  Even if none of us are Flames fans through and through, we know that the smart money will be on the poor, gritty Canadian underdog club (with a little help from the loudest fans in the league) to come out on top.  Here's to hoping that Jerome Iginla raises his first cup; that Calgary will celebrate its first cup in over a decade; and that Lord Stanley comes home.

      So I've finally finished tweaking the look and feel of this site.  I'm impressed with the freedom you have in hacking with the template.  Fun!

      My blog has been born again.  I bailed on the old one because I never used it - it never really worked to my satisfaction anyway.  Anyway, so here I am with a clean blogging slate.  I like to think that having a new blog will give me cause to write more often.  I do like to write, so I should just find the time to put pen to paper (so to speak) whenever the urge strikes me.  These Random Thoughts will be posted as frequently, or unfrequently, as my time and interest allow.  If you happen by, please drop a comment or Random Thought of your own.
