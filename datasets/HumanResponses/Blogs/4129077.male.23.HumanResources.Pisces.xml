      AVP made 38 million dollars over the weekend and Randy Orton is the new World Heavy Weight Champion....take your pick as to what one of those I am excited about.  I had a tire blow out on me on Friday night at around 230am as I was coming home from a friends house.  It scared the shit out of me as I was going around 75 miles an hour at the time.  I get the estimate back tomorrow, looking to be about 400 bucks or so.  That's really all that's going on with me.  I'm going to be moving out of the house in about two months or so and am also getting a second job to help cover my expenses.  Things are going to get a hell of a lot different very soon....

      I just got home from seeing it.  This movie deserves no more than 1 or 2 paragraphs to be spoken about it.  Without futher ado(originally posted by myself on cloudchaser.com):  Thank you Fox for finally killing off any hope for future aliens and predator movies.  This pile of shit was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  There really isn't that much alien on predator violence, the acting was terrible, the story a joke, the characters were poorly developed.  I could just go on and on about this one.  I just can't believe you take a great concept like this and absolutely fuck it up beyond belief.  It really just blows my mind;  I have no faith in Hollywood anymore.  Fuck you 20th Century Fox.  Fuck you Paul W.S. Anderson.  Fuck anybody who had anything to do with the production of this movie.

      Well this is it.  I've been waiting for this fucking movie for nearly 14 years and tonight it all comes to an end.  I'm getting blazed as fuck and going to see this movie with my step brother and a bunch of my friends.  Expect my spoiler filled review tonight around 3am..

      Work went fine today.  I actually expected there to be some mild drama after the shit that went down over the weekend, but in all truths, everything went perfectly fine.  Gennie joked around with me alot today and she was all smiles towards me most of the day.  I don't care if she likes or dislikes me to be perfectly honest;  I just want a smooth running work environment and don't need any bullshit hassle.  So I've been playing ESPN NFL 2k5(cough HDloader cough) and am having a ton of fun with it.  I started off doing a franchise using the Miami Dolphins and managed to win my first preseason game against the Chargers 13-7, but I dropped the next to Carolina 17-14.  Miami has an absolute terrible offensive line in this game which totally kills the entire side.  You need to pray you make one or two big plays during your drive as it is really your only chance to score.  Defensively we are one of the best by far;  Taylor, Madision, Seau, Thomas etc etc dominate in this game.  I have two more preseason games to go before I start the regular season.

      As like all the women I meet, this one turned out to be not so good for myself.  She seemed nice at first, but the girl has some serious mental issues that she needs to get worked out.  I couldn't see myself with someone like her;  I just would not be able to take it.  Oh well though, there is more fish in the sea.  So tonight we had a little birthday party for my brother and step brother, both who are turning or have already turned 21.  I got to play mock bar tender for the night;  I was making electric blue lemonades, which is a great drink filled with rum, vodka, blue carcua and lemonade.  Great stuff.  After we did that for a little while, I went back to Adams and chilled.  I smoked a bunch of weed out of a pipe and then Shana and Cory came over and we just relaxed for a few hours.  I got invited to some hotel party next week that Shana is throwing so I'll definetly be checking that out.  I also have a softball game tomorrow night, but I'm not really thrilled about.  So be it.

      I work in a physical rehabilitation clinic as a tech for an occupational therapist.  We have other phyiscal therapists who work there, but I really don't do much for them as my job pretty much entitles me to stick with just the OT.   The PTs have their own little helper.   Basically, this person(like myself) does the bullshit jobs that nobody likes to do:  cleaning up, getting the patients set up, organizing crap, etc.  So for the past three months we have had one helper by the name of Natalie.  Not a bad girl, very cute, all though she does like to talk a whole bunch.  She is getting ready to go away to school or something like, so for the past week she has been training her replacement Gennie.  Now I think Gennie has some problems in her personal life.  Not that I would really know these things, but just by talking to her you can almost tell.  Now today this girl finally started talking to me after all week of giving me the cold shouler.  I don't mind talking to her as she is rather fun to converse with.  At around 3pm, the office got the great idea of going to Dairy Queen for a mid afternoon snack.  With little resistance, myself and Margarita both decided to go.  We take my car and Margarita starts talking about "You know, I think that girl likes you.  She has been asking us all these questions about whether or not your single"  and other stupid shit like that.  When I get back, Gennie really starts talking to me.  At one point, I was back typing up some paper on the computer and every time Gennie would walk by, she would stop and talk to me about something or other.  I didn't really talk to her much after that as I was busy doing other stuff.  At the very end of the day when I'm leaving, Margarita pulls me aside and basically says this girl wants to give you her phone number and all that jazz.  So I guess tomorrow I'll get it and see what happens.  Not really expecting much, don't know if I seriously want to date a fellow employee, but maybe we'll go out and have some fun.

       urlLink Alien Vs. Predator   So it comes out next Friday.  I've been waiting for this movie for nearly 13 years, but the fact that it is rated PG-13 and directed by Paul Anderson(a guy I don't have much faith in) kind of kills it for me.  I'm hoping for the best, but I really don't expect much out of this.  Damn shame too because with this franchise in the right directors hands(cough cough James Cameron), it could be undeniably bad ass.

      I logged onto AOL about 11:30 pm tonight just to check some mail and see who was online. Out of the blue, this woman who I had been talking to off and on for the past three weeks randomly IM's me out of the blue. Now, this was shocking to me as I hadn't talked to her in maybe a week and probably was not going to again. We had talked about getting together and having nasty hair pulling, screaming, sweaty, hardcore sex, but over the course of these weeks we just stopped talking.  Imagine my surprise when her message simply stated, "Do you want to meet tonight?" I was a tad taken back by the bruntness of the comment; after thinking about it for a few minutes I decided to do it. She lived about 10 minutes from where I'm located at, but I, even though I've lived in this town off and on for 15 years, had trouble finding the house. I called her when I finally made it to the house, went around the back of the house and was let in.  Now, I didn't know she was married and looking for a fuck buddy on the side. I still would have fucked her regardless, but I felt this was information that I needed to know ahead of time. What was even a little more odd was that her husband just laid on a couch the whole time and watched the entire act; it ran maybe 45 minutes or so going by the alarm clock on the side of the bed.  The sex was very good and I was not creeped out by the guy watching us at all. It was hilarious at one point when I was eating her out(completely shaved pussy to my delight) and I went to play with her asshole. I slipped a finger in and was like why the hell is it A) so loose, and B) very slick. Without evening needing to say a word, she causally remarked, "He was fucking me in the ass before you even got here." I fucked her in a few positions before getting behind her and fucking her deep in the ass. 10 minutes of that caused me to blow my load.  Like I stated, having another guy around did not freak me out at all, and if I'm invited back(which I have reason to believe I will) I definitely will go again. More on this to follow in the coming weeks.

      I used to have one of these blogs on Blogspot that I wrote on daily for nearly three months;  one day I just up and stopped posting to it and proceeded to completely forget I had one.  I just remembered today(actually while I was taking a nap this afternoon) and tried to post an update to it.  Alas, I had forgotten the password and now have no way of getting it mailed to me(I no longer have my old email in service).  This is going to be my new site;  I really don't have a clue as to what it's going to be about or even how often I'll post.   New stuff will definetly be put up from time to time, but I will not promise anything to be on a regular schedule.  -John
