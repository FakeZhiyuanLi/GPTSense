      I'm so obsessed with knitting, I decided I needed a spot where I could track my finished projects, muse about future projects, and generally go on about it all without being a drag on my regular journal, where I get to be boring about my life as a mama instead! I thought I'd just post pictures of my projects thus far, starting with my first scarf last November, which I made along with armwamers, with no pattern for a little family friend; however my son, Silas, is modeling them. They were made with some cheapy Lion Brand chenille, since I was deathly afraid of ruining good yarn, and I had yet to discover the many amazing yarn stores Seattle has to offer!        Next I made a couple facecloths for my sisters for Christmas:    I can't recall what order I made all of these, but I made them in December 03 and January 04. The kids' scarves have no pattern, nor does Vivienne's hat, but Silas' hat is "Hot Head" from  Stitch 'n Bitch , as is my kerchief:          Next came my  urlLink Booga Bag , my first attempt at felting. I used Noro Kureyon #126:    Around the same time, I started a sweater for Silas. I only JUST finished it, so I'll post pictures as chronologically as I can manage. I also started the "Little Black Top" from  Stitch 'n Bitch  for my sister, and a felted hat for my other sister. The hat is made with Cascade 220 (black) and a Dalegarn wool (purple), held together with a sparkly bit of something I bought off a cone at my LYS.    Next I decided to make a  urlLink little spring top  for Vivienne. I used Paton's Fresco, and loooved working with a ribbon yarn. It was a nice break from the Little Black Top.    Somewhere in there I made a spring shawl out of Plymouth Eros for our co-op preschool's annual auction, but I can't find any pictures. I did finally finish the "Little Black (olive!) Top", and it fit my sister perfectly. It was my biggest success to that point. I had a huge sense of accomplishment.   Here is Susan showing it off:    I needed a major break from garments after that, but my addiction forced me to goof around with some spare yarns I had. So, yeah, a beer cozy:    That was pretty dorky, but it  did  inspire a little thing I consider to be pure genius:   (don't pretend you don't eat it out of the pint!)  Then  urlLink WEBS  had a huge sale and I got a steal on some closeout Cascade Lana D'Oro.  I started the "Under the Hoodie", again from  Stitch 'n Bitch . I'm still working on it, currently working on the first sleeve, but here's a view of the back:    After frogging the sleeve once, I got sick of it and put it away for a few days. Well, of course, I couldn't NOT knit, so I seamed up Silas' sweater at long last:       And that, my friends, brings us up to today! Still plugging away at Under the Hoodie, having made numerous stupid mistakes on the sleeve and having had to frog it twice. Next up is Knitty's  urlLink Cleo  for my other sister, Helen. I'm also planning on a cardigan by Kristin Sperklund from the  urlLink Interweave  free subscriber patterns for Viv, but I have yet to buy yarn or anything. I need to start thinking holidays, too!  Okay. That's it for my first foray into blogging! C

      I finished another  urlLink tiny ribby tank , except I changed it up a bit-- crossed the straps in the back and did a 3-needle bind-off instead of kitchener to graft the straps. This one is for my friend J's little cutie. Hopefully she will send me a picture of C modeling it!     Now, onto Cleo for real. C

      Look at this yummy yarn:   It came today, for  urlLink Cleo , for my oldest sister. I'm so pleased she decided to order this yarn. It's soft and the color is amazing. Kinda splitty, but I think I'll get used to it. And, for the first time in my personal swatching history, my gauge was spot-on the very first try! I love  urlLink elann.com . I got a good price on the yarn, and I received my order in two business days. I'm excited to start it, but I think I will finish up Tiny Ribby Tank #2 first. C

      Here's Vivienne in her new tank:     poser!     She immediately pulled like crazy on one of the straps & stretched it all to hell. Damn cotton. I washed it on warm/ gentle and it looked really messed up upon coming out of the wash, so I now have it on delicate tumble dry with hopes it's not ruined. Ayeeee. C

      A LiveJournal friend recently knit  urlLink this cute tank  for her daughter, and I was inspired to make one for Miss Viv. I happened to get some uber-clearance Lily Baby Cotton, so this cost me seriously less than $3 to knit. I had to learn kitchener stitch, which sounded easier than it was. Actually, the execution wasn't that hard, but it doesn't look that great. I need to figure out the trick to making it look nice & neat, I guess. Anyway, overall, I'm pleased with the top.     The very middle stripe is leftover variegated cotton I had from some dishcloths. It looks much better in person than it does in the picture. It's obviously too late to have V model it, so I will add a picture of her showing it off tomorrow. These quickie projects are very satisfying to instant-gratification types like me.  The yarn arrived for my sister's  urlLink Cleo  halter. It isn't quite as it appeared on my monitor. I guess there's the flaw in bargain-hunting online. I think it will work out okay, though. That's the next thing on the needles, and I will work on my hoodie here & there, too. I really want to make a big, soft afghan, too, in hopes my husband will finally get rid of the holey, sun-bleached, monkey-vomit-green one he's had forever. C               Â

      I made the Umbilical Cord Hat from S'nB for a friend's new baby this evening. It's nice to know there's a pattern I can just whip out in an evening when friends have babies! It's cream-colored, despite looking white in the photo.     Such a nice, easy thing to knit! C

      So my ice cream cozy was featured on  urlLink Cozy of the Week . If you want to knit one, too, here's the made-up-as-I-went pattern:  On size 5 US double pointed knitting needles, cast on 48 stitches, join, and divide among 3 needles.  Knit 3 rows in k2p2 rib.   Knit two rows.   Add in scrap novelty yarn and knit however much you want with that.   When you are about halfway done, k2tog after the sixth stitch on each needle.   Add more eyelash or whatever as you see fit. About 3/4 way through, do the k2tog decrease again.  For the next 2 rows, k2p2 rib, then cast off in rib. The last row should be the bottom of your cozy.  I'm thinking after I finish the second sleeve, I'm going to put my hoodie aside for a bit. I need to knit the Umbilical Cord Hat from Stitch 'n Bitch for a friend's new baby, then I think I'll knit up one of  urlLink these  cuties for Viv. I got some Lily Baby Cotton for next to nothing today at Joann, since my store is moving and they are clearing everything out. I think it will work well for both the umbilical cord hat and the tiny ribby tank. C

      It's not so beautiful outside today, and T & I were out late celebrating his birthday last night, which leads me to think today would be a good day to sit around and knit. Unfortunately, I'm really sick of my hoodie. I can't start Viv's cardigan, since I'm waiting for the yarn to arrive. I can't start Cleo for my sister, because again, I'm waiting for the yarn. Ayeee. I guess I will just tough it our and work on the hoodie. I just want to be done with it already. I should look through my stash to see if I have some random cotton to make Viv a little tank. So, the new issue of  urlLink Knitty . People are all a-swirl on the various knitting communities. People seems to feel strongly. I don't. I think some of the stuff is cute, though I am more inclined to make things I can show off, I guess because I'm still newish and it feels like such a giant accomplishment every time I finish a piece. I am considering making  urlLink hush hush . It's really beautiful. I might wear it in public, actually. I'm thinking a silvery grey with black and hot pink ribbon. Ohh, Maybe I'll knit the top in black, the rest in the silvery grey and pink ribbon. Hmmmm. If I do, I'm sure it will take me ages. I can see it being something to have perpetually in progress when I get sick of scarves, hats and sweaters over the winter, and then voila! Next spring, I'd have a lovely little nightie/ dress. We'll see. Time to vacuum and do dishes, then I will hunker down with the sleeves to my hoodie. C

      I finally got through the lace band! It's really a cool pattern, once you sit down and do it with out small-child interruptions! I expect I'll finish the body today and then I need to go back and make another triangle.     It's a little dark, and it's squished onto the circs, but you get the idea.  What's next? I am going to finish off a Big Bad Baby Blanket for my friend,  urlLink langus , who has thrown in the towel. Then I need to decide whether to focus on a bag for me-- I've got some  Lamb's Pride Bulky in black and a nice deep pink waiting for me to knit & felt. I have a cardigan I want to start for Viv. I need to go back and add the hood to my hoodie. And then there's xmas presents... I'm pretty sure there will always be plenty of projects awaiting me from here on out. C

      oh. my. god.  Cleo is slowly killing me. I've ripped out one of the bra triangles twice. I got sick of that, so I moved on to the lace band, and guess what? I've ripped it out not once, not twice, but ohhhh 5 or 6 times! I've lost count. I need one full evening of total silence to get the lace band done, and done right.  If I don't get it right next time, I may throw in the towel and come back to it next spring. ugh.  I hate when knitting sucks. C
