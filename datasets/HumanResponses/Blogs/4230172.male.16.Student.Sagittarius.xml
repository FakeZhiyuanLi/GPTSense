      Then there was a monkey and his name was Billy.  Billy was sad that Jamal died...  But the monkey had ADD so he forgot about it pretty soon and went back to swinging in the trees.   > Later that day   But then he swam into an electric fence and died...  Fuck I am bored.

      Normally when you hear 'lets go to a party'. You think drunk chicks and beer, yes? Well yesterday, running into this morning was the Sale College Deb party out at Brett Laurias place in longford, about 8 km from Sale.  At about 12:30 in the morning it was decided we would not ring my mother to get her to pick me and the others up, but rather to get a group of other people and go on an expedition back to the town. Silly idea, the freezing cold, a bit of rain, lack of scenery and even the inability of many to walk in a straight line.  During the first part of the walk it was loads of fun, all of us mooning several cars and ripping out signs and markers along the side of the road. An hour or so into the trip we found an ESSO hardhat on the road, that was very exciting, but then at that point me and Christon were at least 10-15 minutes ahead of the rest of the group.  Once we reached Sale, and got to the netball courts, the first sign of civilization, it was about 2-2:30. Then we sat and waited for the others, but no one came, so then I rang Jason, and he said, and I quote: ' I am at home, we got a lift from Belindas mum about half an hour ago '. At this point I hung up.  So the two of us stubbled into Sale, had a rest at my fathers before heading off our separate ways, I got home at about 3.  What a fun weekend... And next weekend, I am going to attempt to walk back from the Maffra Deb party, which is, never-the-less, in Maffra. Funo.  Well, I are tired, nite all.

      Welcome y'all.  This was inspired by Pricey,  making me  comment on his blog, and thus the boredem became apparent and I knew that it was my calling to make one too......  Or to put it another way I was sick of just spouting off random comments at people in chatrooms and then being kicked, so now I can be dodgy in my own space.  Catch.
