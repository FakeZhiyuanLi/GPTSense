      Where on earth did spring go?!?  We had, what, maybe 2 days of spring between freezing cold and this sweaty stuff!!  It was like 88 around here today - sweat rolling between the mountains I call my chest....... ponding up in my bra ready to burst!  Ass stickin to the nice computer chair we bought in the winter - leather, yeah great idea - THEN!!  Sitting in the bus today - must be 15-20 degrees hotter in the driver seat than outside - thought I was just going to melt and pour right down those bus steps into oblivion!  How I wanted to smack the van driver this morning who whined over the 2 way radio as to the fact that her air conditioning wasn't working as good as it should - could have reached through that mic and strangle her!!  Least she has it!  Ok done with my complaining - for now.........

      Here it is Thursday and he is to be home tomorrow.  Hoping its by the time our little one has her play but seems when I am counting on it something comes up!  I miss him so damn much - guess I should be glad, had about 3 years of him home everyday - why should I want more?  The feeling of being a single mother again has set in - but won't be leaving anytime soon since he will be at this for awhile yet.  I know I shouldn't be bitchin cause there are tonz of families out there whose parent(s) are overseas - but damn it he's not.  WHY does he gotta be so good at his job that he gets sent away to other facilities?!?!  *sigh  I try sooooooooo hard to act like its ok that he's gone and we are handling everything here at home ok without him - so he can do his job and not have to worry about us.  BUT its been hard - end of the year, so much going on that he's missing.  Oh well - ok i'm done rambling!  More later or tomorrow..........

      Here it is Tuesday and this week SUCKS already!!!  Found out hubby has new assignment that he'll be gone weekly from Sunday to Friday - giving his family a whopping whole day to spend with him while he sleeps to catch up from the week!!  I was hoping this would all be coming to and end soon but he tells me this may go on for another couple months.    Good news though - I am driving for two field trips this week again!  Going to a local zoo tomorrow and then an amusement park on Friday.  What a job - drive them there, get in free AND get paid by the hour to enjoy whatever the trip may be that day!    This whole 'blog' thing is still very new to me - not sure what all I should be saying in here.  Not sure if anyone really gives a crap either but at least I can vent.  More will come as I get more comfy with this whole thing!!   Laterz!
