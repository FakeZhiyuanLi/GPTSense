      Today is fun day at school.  The kids all get to go around and do fun games and play all day.  I'm going to go and take pictures of the boys.  DS3 is staying home with a babysitter!  (AHHHH!!)  Not to have to drag him around and negotiate with him.  Plus then I can actually have a conversation with the other moms.  Freedom!   Things are going along just like normal...  Nothing much exciting.   Not sure why I'm so tired.  It is so hard to get up every morning.  I guess just being the end of school and doing so much.   The John Gresham book is really good, hard to put down.   I'm going to list these air tools DH has for sale on eBay today.  I hope they will sell. I've bought lots of stuff off eBay, but never tried to sell anything.  Should be interesting.    Later

      I'm on my way to work this AM.  I have to take the van into the shop, DH made the appointment, I have to be there at ten till 9.  The gas gauge is doing funny things and we want to get everything fixed on time, we have one more year till the warranty runs out.  But I hate taking it into the shop.  That guy there treats me like the little woman who doesn't know anything.  I hate that.   Then I have to go to work for awhile.   Then I have to get groceries. :(   Then DS1 has a open house thing at school, he is telling jokes for the program.   They are so cute.   8:19, wow I have to leave in 10 mins.  I gotta go.

      While vacationing on a ranch, Paul Martin gets thrown from his horse, lands on a rattlesnake, gets bitten and dies because the emergency room at the nearest hospital is too understaffed to treat him in time.  So his soul arrives in heaven and he is met by St. Peter at the Pearly Gates. “Welcome to Heaven,” says St. Peter. “Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a Liberal around these parts, so we’re not sure what to do with you.”  “No problem, just let me in; I’m a believer.” says Martin.  “I’d like to just let you in, but I have orders from the Man Himself. He says you have to spend one day in Hell and one day in Heaven. Then you must choose where you’ll live for eternity.”  “But, I’ve already made up my mind, I want to be in Heaven,” replied Martin.  “I’m sorry, but we have our rules.” And with that, St. Peter escorts him to an elevator and he goes down, down, down, all the way to Hell.  The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a lush golf course; the sun is shining in a cloudless sky, the temperature a perfect 72 degrees. In the distance is a beautiful clubhouse.  Standing in front of it is his dad, and thousands of other Liberals who had helped him out over the years. Pierre Trudeau, Jean Marchand, Pelletier, St. Laurent etc. The whole of the “Left” was there, everyone laughing, happy and casually but expensively dressed.  They run to greet him, hug him, and reminisce about the good times they had getting rich at expense of the “suckers and peasants.” They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar. The Devil himself comes up to Martin with a frosty drink, “Have a Margarita and relax, Paul!”  “Uh, I can’t drink no more, I took a pledge,” says Martin, dejectedly.  “This is Hell, son. You can drink and eat all you want and not worry, and it just gets better from there!”  Martin takes the drink and finds himself liking the Devil, who he thinks is a really very friendly guy who tells funny jokes like himself, and pulls hilarious nasty pranks, kind of like they pulled on the GST and Free Trade promises. They are having such a great time that, before he realises it, it’s time to go.  Everyone gives him a big hug and waves as Martin steps on the elevator and heads upward.  When the elevator door reopens, he is in Heaven again and St. Peter is waiting for him. “Now it’s time to visit Heaven,” the old man says, opening the gate.  So for 24 hours Martin is made to hang out with a bunch of honest, good-natured people who enjoy each other’s company, talk about things other than money, and treat each other decently.  Not a nasty prank or frat boy joke among them; no fancy country clubs and, while the food tastes great, it’s not caviar or lobster. And these people are all poor, he doesn’t see anybody he knows, and he isn’t even treated like someone special! Worst of all, to Martin, Jesus turns out to be some kind of Jewish hippie with his endless ‘peace’ and ‘do unto others’ jive. “Whoa,” he says uncomfortably to himself. “Pierre Trudeau never prepared me for this!”  The day done, St. Peter returns and says, “Well, you’ve spent a day in Hell and a day in Heaven. Now choose where you want to live for eternity.”  With the ‘Jeopardy’ theme playing softly in the background, Martin reflects for a minute, then answers: “Well, I would never have thought I’d say this — I mean, Heaven has been delightful and all — but I really think I belong in Hell with my friends.”  So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down, all the way to Hell. The doors of the elevator open and he is in the middle of a barren scorched earth covered with garbage and toxic industrial waste, kind of like Sudbury.  He is horrified to see all of his friends, dressed in rags and chained together, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. They are groaning and moaning in pain, faces and hands black with grime.  The Devil comes over to Martin and puts an arm around his shoulder. “I don’t understand,” stammers a shocked Martin, “Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a clubhouse and we ate lobster and caviar, drank booze. We screwed around and had a great time. Now there’s just a wasteland full of garbage and everybody looks miserable!”  The Devil looks at him, smiles slyly, and purrs, “Yesterday we were campaigning; today you voted for us!”

      Yes I did it.  I bought a gmail account off ebay.  Only $3.25 US.   urlLink supermom13@gmail.com  my actual name was already unavailable... But I'll use that one for my blog address.    I got a little sun while sitting outside yesterday.  I know how totally uncool it is to lie in the sun, but man, I get so sick of this pastey white color... Hopefully it will be ok.  I must admit it feels good.   It is going to be 90 out today.  Already there is one big fire burning in BC, nowhere near here though.  I'm sure we'll smell smoke soon though, and the sky will be red.  Like last summer.    What to make for dinner, God, I am so sick of cooking?!  Last night we had salmon, but DH didn't like it, he complained,  [I say fix your own damn dinner and quit your complaining.][In my head I say that]  Marriage is good, but it is these damn little irritations that get to me.  You'd think that after 12 years he would know what bugs me the most, leaving dirty socks around, not hanging his towel up, complaining about dinner.  And the worst:  "Did you do anything today?"

      Well I completely missed yesterday, no blogging for me.  DH was on the computer most of the day.  Playing Command & Conquer.  He gets so cranky about it.  If I acted like that when he came into say something to me when I was on the computer he would be upset.  But he thinks it is ok when he does it.  Makes me mad.  I don't get how he gets away with that one.  I guess it is easier to avoid a big confrontation.  {SIGH} Dr. Phill would have a field day with us.  Although we seem boring compared with most of the people on his show.  No affairs, or abuse, just pretty much normal folks we are.   So I just got the boys out the door to school.  Only 5 days left.  And then it will be summer vacation.  Wow will I make it 60+ days home with 3 boys!  I may have to hide out in my room sometimes.   So it is now Tuesday Morning all is quiet, DS3 is still asleep... Everybody else is at work.   I have some work stuff to do today.  And I have to go and get gas, as we are so empty in the van.   I started a new book yesterday, John Grisham "The Partner" it seems pretty good thus far. Loads better then the Nora Roberts crap.   I want to make a summer music CD... I need to think of some good summer songs.   Uh-oh, I here DS3 is up now, I better go & get him.   Later......

      I had a Caesar salad with shrimp and a glass of wine that was my dinner.  Never mind I just ate it at 11PM.  I feel kind of sick now, I don't think salad is designed to be eaten after 8PM.   DS3 is upstairs asleep in his bed.  DH, DS1, DS2 are at the big Father/Son sleepover at church, probably playing dodge ball or eating chips right now.   This blog site is a bit hard to navigate, I downloaded this HELLO thing but can't figure out how to get my picture on the side of the page, oh well.  This shouldn't be so hard.  I can usually figure these things out.   I'm tired.   But it is so nice to be alone, that I want to stay up just to have the solitude.   I need to write an email to a relative, that I haven't been in touch with much, but should have been.  I feel somewhat afraid to be open with her, she'll talk to other relatives and tell them what I am up to, not that it is very exciting, just she doesn't tell me anything they are doing.  So I guess I feel on guard, and don't know what to say.  Or I could just not answer, wait till next Christmas, and say all the blah blah stuff.  I'm not sure why it is so hard to be real.  I'm going to watch the news, a shame they killed another American.  How horrible.   I am reading this Nora Roberts crap right now. It is ok, but I now there are much better books out there.  I have been so tired I can only read a couple of pages and then I wake up sometime with the light on and the book on my face.   I have time alone and now I can't think of anything to do, or all I want to do is just go to sleep.   DH liked his Father's day stuff, but presents don't get him super excited like everybody else here.  Hot day tomorrow the weather man is saying.  It is great, so nice to have summer, it feels like a vaction.  Too bad we can't go anywhere!   I have to stay focused on January... Disneyland.   There was a bad accident on the Highway on the way home from church tonight.  A truck or van (it was hard to tell) was all mangled in the ditch.  The kind of accident that gives you chills when you see it.   That's it, I can't stay awake any longer.  G'night zzzzzzzzzzzzzz

      A nice hot day.  Took the kids to shop for DH for father's day.  Cleaned the house up, DS2 helped a lot, which is new, I didn't have to yell to get him to help.  DS3 is still sick and sleeping now, but his throat hurts when he eats.  The antibiotics will kick in soon I hope.   I'm tired, this week was too busy.  I can't wait till school is out then things will calm down some.  Except then I will wish school was back in, because my life will be filled with 3 boys 24/7.   DH is tired too, very cranky last night.  I hope stress at work gets better.  I keep telling him a bad day at this job is like a really good day at his old job.  I hope he likes the father's day stuff we got him.   Got my hair streaked last night, she did it and then it didn't have enough blonde so then she did it again.  It was nice to talk to her, and forget about my own problems for awhile.  Not that I have many problems.   We have church tonight, DH is supposed to share about Father's day and being a Dad.  I did a PP slide with pictures of the boys on it to be on behind him while he talks.  Seemed like a cool idea, but now I wonder if it is tacky?  Oh well, we'll find out.  Then there is a Father son sleepover after church tonight.  So I will come home with DS3 and put him to bed and enjoy some "alone time"   Well here he comes home from work, so I better be off.

       It is very hot out there today.&nbsp; WHEW.&nbsp; Almost 36 Celsius.&nbsp; (Almost 100 F.&nbsp;)&nbsp;    The boys are out playing in the pool, DS1 & DS2, but DS3 is over tired and he is in bed taking a nap ( I really hope) DS1's friend is staying for the weekend.&nbsp;    DH is at work, like every Saturday.&nbsp; I am so tired of him working Saturdays.&nbsp;    My friend, found out this week that her brother died.&nbsp; He was only 34.&nbsp; He had a heart attack, in his sleep.&nbsp; His landlord found him.&nbsp; She was so upset, I felt so terrible for her.&nbsp; I have never had anyone that close to me die, so I can't say know how it feels. &nbsp;  I made some lagsange at took over to them.&nbsp; I can't imagine how that must feel.&nbsp;    DS2's 7th birthday is this week, but it really sucks to have your birthday in the summer, then nobody can come to your party because everybody is on vacation.&nbsp; So he has decided we will postpone it until school starts, that way more than one kid can come!&nbsp;    I have been downloading Shrek 2 soundtrack all day, only to have a few songs not work, and have to look for them again & again.&nbsp; I think I like this Counting Crows song the best on the album....&nbsp;     &nbsp;    "So she said what's the problem baby What's the problem I don't know Well maybe I'm in love (love) Think about it every timeI think about it Can't stop thinking 'bout it"     &nbsp;

      I have got DS2 in soccer camp.  So I have to spend my mornings in town waiting for him to get done at camp, and trying hard to keep DS3 entertained.  (Not an always easy undertaking).  It has gotten hot again so I have taken him to the library, the grocery store, McDonald's, and the park.   Then earlier this week DH and I got some paint, so we have now painted DS2's room bright blue, and then once we start painting we look at the carpet and realize what crap is in there so now I am here waiting for the carpet guy to get here and install his new carpet.  Then I will get to work on painting/staining the stairs.  I think we should buy stock in the Benjamin Moore paint company.  We spend so much money there... I love painting though.  I could paint all summer.  I just love it.  Once I start I can't stop.  I'm a home improvement addict.  I guess there are worse things I could be.   DS1 is still at Gramma's.  I really miss him.  When he gets home we are going to paint his room, "Green with envy"  is the name of the color we choose for his room.  :) Cute eh? And then we will get carpet in his room too.  It is nice to be getting all of this done.   DS3 is down for a nap, I better start on those stairs.... :-)

      I don't get why human nature is so selfish. And I don't know why it is so hard to forgive either.  At some point I say, "I forgive you" and at that moment I DO forgive that person.  But then like a month later, I pick it up again and this battle rages on.  How can I forgive at one time and then take it back on again?  And then I pick a fight, for really no reason.  {I mean, I know we are sinful, sometimes I just can't believe how really sinful we are at all moments, like even with being selfish, with my time, or my money} Why can't I just let it go? [and let it stay gone??] It is a battle.  I need to ask God to help me.   It seems I operate with this feeling really happy, or feeling really down.  "Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity Our reason coexists with our insanity And though we choose between reality and madness It's either sadness or euphoria "

      The Patriot's Act: What's More American Than Asking Questions?   -- by Michael Moore   "You should ask yourself some difficult questions about just how proud you are of the America we now inhabit:     Are you proud that one in six children lives in poverty in America? Are you proud that 40 million adult Americans are functional illiterates? Are you proud that the bulk of the jobs being created these days are low- and minimum-wage jobs? Are you proud of asking your fellow Americans to live on $5.15 an hour? Are you proud that, according to a National Geographic Society survey, 85% of young adult Americans cannot find Iraq on the map (and 11% cannot find the United States!)? Are you proud that the rest of the world, which poured out its heart to us after Sept. 11, now looks at us with disdain and disgust? Are you proud that more than one billion people on this planet do not have access to clean drinking water when we have the resources and technology to remedy this immediately? Are you proud of the fact that our president sent our soldiers off to a war that had nothing to do with the self-defense of this country?  If these things represent what it means to be an American these days — and I am an American — should I hang my head in shame? No. Instead, I intend to perform what I believe is my patriotic duty. I can't think of a more American thing to do than raise questions — and demand truthful answers — when our leader wants to send our sons and daughters off to die in a war.     If we don't do that — the bare minimum — for those who offer to defend our country, then we have failed them and ourselves. They offer to die for us, if necessary, so that we can be free. All they ask in return is that we never send them into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. And with this war, we have broken faith with our troops by sending them off to be killed and maimed for wrong and immoral reasons.  This is the true state of disgrace we are living in. I hope we can make it up someday to these brave kids (and older men and women in our reserves and National Guard). They deserve an apology, they deserve our thanks — and a raise — and they deserve a big parade with lots of flags.     I would like to lead that parade, carrying the largest flag. And I would like the country to proclaim that never again will a war be fought unless it is our last resort.  Let's create a world in which, when people see the Stars and Stripes, they will think of us as the people who brought peace to the world, who brought good-paying jobs to all citizens and clean water for the world to drink."  In anticipation of that day, I am putting my flag out today, with hope and with pride.

      Wow it's been awhile.  But it feels good to do this, so I am trying to press on with blogging.   The kids are out of school for like over a week now.  And my sanity is still intact, which amazes me.  I haven't been yelling much either, I guess I don't have PMS yet eh.  Went to the states last weekend.  I just don't think I am much of an American any longer, those people down there have a flag stuck to every surface, and I just wonder WHY?   My cousin sent me this thing written by Michael Moore, and I really liked this part,   "For too long now we have abandoned our flag to those who see it as a symbol of war and dominance, as a way to crush dissent at home. Flags are flying from the back of SUVs, rising high above car dealerships, plastering the windows of businesses and adorning paper bags from fast-food restaurants. But these flags are intended to send a message: "You're either with us or you're against us," "Bring it on!" or "Watch what you say, watch what you do."    My mother insits she hates Michael Moore, but I see that he has a point.  I'd like to see his movie.  But DH would probably fall asleep in it, and I don't want to go alone!   DS1 is at my mom's house for 2 weeks.  I hope she is not telling him all this American patriosim stuff... I'm so glad to live in Canada.   The other day was the anniversary of us moving to this town... it has been 10 years!  10 years we have lived in the same town.  That is hard to believe.   We went to see Spiderman 2.  I'm getting too old for movies like that.  The boys liked it though.   I got LHOTP season 5 today!  Yeah!  I have to wait till DS1 gets home, he is the only one who likes to watch it with me.  DS2 says it is retarded.  [LHOTP= Little house on the prairie] and DH will watch sometimes, when there is no show about rebuilding cars is on.   This past weekend in the states we boated and jet skied.  It was fun.  But sometimes I just feel like I am somewhere else, or that it wasn't really me. Or that I just don't really fit in with that whole life anymore.  I'd much rather stay home.  And I get so frustrated with my mom.  Sometimes I wonder if like she wasn't my mom if I would even be friends with her.  It is weird.  I don't fit in and I have been doing and saying the "right things"  to please them for years, and not even being myself.  I can be real with DH and kids, but not mom & dad.  And I feel so much more relaxed when I am not around them.   What a terrible kid I am.  But I think I guess I am becoming  my own person? Maybe?  I say who cares what they think... But yet some part of me always wants to PLEASE them and be the perfect kid.   Well I want to go read for a bit before everybody descends on me "What's for Dinner??"  I'm reading at the moment, "Nights in Rodanthe"  By Nicholas Sparks  urlLink http://www.nicholassparks.com/Novels/NightsInRodanthe/Flap.html   Later...............

      We got a cat! She is 3, black with some white, and her name is Olivia! DS1 wanted that for his birthday (which is coming up next week) so I shelled out the $90 bucks to the SPCA and we now have a cat. I could have gotten a free cat from a friend, but then I would have had to have it fixed and shots and all of that, which would have cost me like $250. 00 so I went with the SPCA deal. DS1 is excited, and she seems pretty mellow... So I hope she remains that way. DS3 was pretty excited about her too, he just sort of wants to grab and stuff though.  Being two years old it is sort of hard to understand why you can't pick Kitty up by the tail and swing her around... Not much else new, we have been working like crazy on the house, we got the kids bedrooms done, paint, carpet, baseboards, everything, and they look great! Then we also got the upstairs bathroom DONE!! It is great! Paint, and we got some of those stick on tiles, until we can get real tile, and wow it looks great. You can almost not recognize the bathroom when you are in there. Also got a new shower curtain, towel rack etc, so that made a major improvement. I have had this bad summer cold, it is gross, my throat hurts, I am sneezing constantly, and I feel sort of achey and tired. But it seems I can't stop... I still have so much to do. DS2 is at my mom's for the week. Which is great for him but now DS1 has no "playmate" so I have become the "playmate" and as much as I adore DS1, he could be a little more independent.. he is constantly asking me questions, and wanting to know what we are going to do tomorrow and the next day, and the next day... While I love his questions, it just gets kind of intense, I don't know what we are doing from one minute to the next much less the day after tomorrow! DH starting jogging again, I wonder how long it will last this time? I'm gonna go and get some pictures of the new rooms to post here on my blog. :-)
