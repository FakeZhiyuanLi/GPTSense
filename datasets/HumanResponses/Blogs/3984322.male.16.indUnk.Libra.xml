      I was visiting my grandma Aune yesterday. She is very powerful and  positive woman - at the age of 78. She takes care of her huge and  beautiful garden yard as a full day job.  We were eating at her place. The dining table is in front of a window  where you can see to the road. A man drove by bike and stopped in front  of the neighbours gates. He took a beer bottle from his bag and tried  to open it with his bike. He chopped and hacked it to and with his bike  but didn't manage to get the cork away. Suddenly my grandma ran to the  kitchen and said "I'm gonna give that man a bottle opener" (in Finnish  of course). Then she ran outside and gave it to that man. He got to  drink his beer and continue his journey. Incredible kindness. I was  stunned.  Yesterday was anyway some kind of nice day. It was the sunniest day of  the summer in Finland since it has been raining almost every day now. I  went to cut grass to my grandma's place - it took two hours without any  breaks. After that I had coffee with my friend on the town square. Then  I went swimming with my brother to the national park of Aulanko. I had  biked some 30 km.

      I started programming my own Wiki software last week with PHP and MySQL databases. I've seen that every wiki software needs some kind of technical skills, for tags or linking to another page. So I'm making it simplier to add pages and link them with each other - of course I'm including some core functions. Wiki's are wonderful way of organizing data and what I'm trying to do is to make it a little more suitable for corporate and non-tech use.   Linking from a document to another is simple and there are two ways to do it. You can either create a new document linked to document you're displaying or you can link already existing documents to the document. Links will be displayed in a menu on the side. You can also attach files to documents. As search engine I'm using MySQL FULLTEXT. It'll do until something better appears.   I'll release the - at the moment I'm calling it murrosWiki - program as open source, propably under GPL license. But it'll take months to program it for some kind of release.   I've also planned to include an XML database system in it. That means simply that user can create databases from scratch by specifying what fields it should contain and the program puts those specs into MySQL table. The inserted data will be located in another table in XML form. I'm not sure if it's worth all the work but I'll give it a try.   Would anyone be interested in this kind of software? Developing it? Any tips for me?
