      It's been a hectic week!  We've just finished VBS at our congregation (which I was in charge of) -- we had almost 60 kids the last two evenings.  Anyway, back to blogging.  The  Tennessean  (Nashville's daily newpaper) contains an  urlLink article  on this weekend's festivities at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, celebrating the 200th anniversary of the signing of the "Last Will and Testament of the Springfield Presbytery" in 1804.  Also mentioned is the long-awaited debut of the   urlLink Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement  .

       The evolution of Alexander Campbell's understanding of baptism   As noted in my first post on this subject, Thomas and Alexander Campbell labored and studied extensively before reaching the conclusion that immersion was God's will.  Being convicted of that, they submitted to baptism at the hands of Matthias Luce, a Regular Baptist preacher, in June 1812 [Robert Richardson,  Memoirs of Alexander Campbell , 1.395].  Yet, almost a decade later, at the time of the Campbell-Walker and Campbell-McCalla debates, we find that Alexander Campbell was  still  studying and that his understanding of the design (i.e. the purpose) of baptism was still developing.  Richardson himself hints at this when he says, at the end of chapter 18 of the  Memoirs : "The full import and meaning of the institution of baptism was, however, still reserved for future discovery" [1.405].  It was only during the 1820s, a full decade after his baptism, that Campbell came to the conclusion that baptism was "for the remission of sins."  Several questions come to mind at this point for brother Hafley:   1) Campbell, it is well known, was never re-baptized, even after he came to the understanding that baptism was "for the remission of sins."  Why not?  Was his first baptism, done in obedience to the command of God, valid?  2) What about Matthias Luce, the Baptist minister who baptized him?  Does the fact that he was a Baptist invalidate Campbell's baptism?  To put it another way, do the beliefs of the baptizer in any way determine the validity of the baptism?  I don't want to read too much into brother Hafley's article, but I have often heard it said on this topic that "one cannot be taught wrong and baptized right."  Is this true?  (Campbell, after all, taught himself on this subject.)  If it is true, what does it say about the power of God?    3) Should Campbell have undergone re-baptism many years later when he understood that God, in baptism, effects the remission of sins?  Campbell clearly did not think so.  Roderick Chestnut, in an article entitled "John Thomas and the Rebaptism Controversy," [in  Baptism and the Remission of Sins , ed. David Fletcher, Joplin, MO: College Press, 1990] discusses Campbell's views on this very point.  Campbell likened baptism to a wedding ceremony.  Working off of 1 Corinthians 3.21-23, he asserts that the believer who is "in Christ" through baptism has all things:   "Because we are Christ's, we have all things. . . .Among these 'all things' we can easily find the forgiveness of sins. . . .Some persons have thought that because they did not understand the import of christian immersion, at the time of their immersion, they ought to be immersed again in order to enjoy the blessings resulting from this institution; but as reasonably might a woman seek to be married a second, third, or fourth time to her husband, because at the expiration of the second, third, and fourth years of her marriage, she discovered new advantages and blessings resulting from her alliance with her husband, of which she was ignorant at the time of her marriage" [Campbell, "Ancient Gospel -- No. VI [:] Immersion,"  Christian Baptist  5 (2 June 1828): 447].  This is not to say that Campbell thought that all baptisms were necessarily valid.  He does think that there are reasons for baptism that are invalid.  But it is clear that, in Campbell's view, perfect understanding was not necessary for a baptism to be valid.  In other words, God remits sins in baptism whether we fully understand that at the time of our baptism or not.

       urlLink Travis Stanley  blogs today about the meaning of (pro)life.  I read the article in  urlLink Sojourners  that he cited a couple of weeks back and it really challenged me to think about my own pro-life stance more deeply especially as it relates to political affiliations.  The Republican Party  does  oppose abortion, but that opposition often comes across as rather shallow; in other words, Republicans don't seem to care about the baby once it leaves the womb.  Furthermore, they seem intent on prosecuting wars all around the world that take the lives of innocents in untold numbers.  The Democrats seem to have the opposite problem: they oppose war but wholeheartedly support abortion.  All this without even mentioning other life-and-death issues (euthanasia, the death penalty, etc.).  At any rate, it looks as though there are now resources for a more comprehensive pro-life ethic.  Check out    urlLink A Seamless Garment  (a.k.a. A Consistent Life Ethic) for more information.

      Just finished  The Return of the King .  It left me feeling lonely at the end -- when you spend a great deal of time with a group of characters, often you are loath to part with them.  On the subject of Tolkien, I just bought Matthew Dickerson's  urlLink  Following Gandalf  , but I probably won't get to it for a couple of months at least.  Dickerson interprets Tolkien's Middle Earth tales through the lense of free will and moral responsibility and makes what appears to be a convincing case for a Christian interpretation of the works.  Also, for bedtime reading, I've begun Defoe's  urlLink  Robinson Crusoe  .  I've owned this book for years but have never read it.  My interest was rekindled after a recent vacation that my wife and I spent on Ocracoke Island, North Carolina.  Ocracoke is best known as the site, in November 1718, of a bloody naval battle that resulted in the death of Capt. Edward Teach (a.k.a.  urlLink Blackbeard ).  Anyway, the story is told in   urlLink A General History of the Pyrates  , which was for many years attributed to Daniel Defoe.  As it turns out, that's not the case; the book still makes for great reading though.  Aarrgh!  Link of the Day:  urlLink "Torture, War, and Presidential Powers"  by Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) (via the always-provocative LewRockwell.com).

      A few thoughts on the article linked above...  First,  pace  my brother Hafley, A. Campbell's view of baptism  did  evolve.  Richardson's  Memoirs  (I.396-397) indicates that both Thomas and Alexander Campbell had spent a great deal of time studying and developing their views on the subject of baptism at the time of their baptism in June 1812:   "In a very long address, he [Thomas] accordingly reviewed the entire ground which he had occupied, and the struggles that he had undergone in reference to the particular subject of baptism, which he had earnestly desired to dispose of, in such a manner, that it might be no hindrance in the attainment of that Christian unity which he had labored to establish upon the Bible alone....but having at length attained a clearer view of duty, he felt it incumbent upon him to submit to what he now plainly saw was an important Divine institution."   Richardson goes on to say that they (Thomas and Alexander) understood baptism to be a command of God and were thus immersed.  It was only later, at the time of the Walker and McCalla debates (in the mid-1820s) that Campbell formulated his understanding of baptism "for the remission of sins."  The fundamental question, which Hafley doesn't quite address head on, is this: "Was Alexander Campbell saved?"  This is an uncomfortable question for him, though, because of its implications.  According to brother Hafley's baptismal theology, Campbell cannot have been saved because he was not baptized specifically "for the remission of sins."  On the other hand, however, it is embarrassing to state outright that the man who initiated the Restoration Movement is currently burning in hell.  So, brother Hafley is left with a conundrum.    It is not a new conundrum though.  In a 1901 written debate carried in the  Gospel Advocate , J.D. Tant and James A. Harding discussed the following proposition: "The Scriptures teach that a man must believe and understand that baptism is 'for,' in the sense of 'in order to,' to the remission of sins at the time of his baptism to make said baptism valid."  Tant affirmed and Harding denied.    In the course of the debate, the subject of A. Campbell's baptism came up.  Tant is caught on the horns of the same dilemma that our brother Hafley is caught upon: from his rigid insistence that baptism is only "for the remission of sins" it follows that Campbell was not scripturally baptized.  But Tant can't bring himself to say that outright.  Harding catches him in this.  A statement in Harding's "Fourth Reply" to Tant brings this dilemma into sharp relief:   "He [Tant] likes Campbell and Scott, hence he appears to be satisfied with their baptism, though they did not then understand  eis  remission; he has no such partiality for Baptists in general, so he repudiates their baptisms, though they understood  eis  remission just as well as Campbell and Scott.  If to understand  eis  remission is necessary, it is certain they were not baptized."   So it is with brother Hafley.

      DisciplesWorld.com has a nice article about Ronald Reagan's affiliation with First Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in Dixon, Illinois and Disciples-related Eureka College.  Reagan was the third president to be affiliated with the Stone-Campbell movement (along with James Garfield and Lyndon Johnson).   Recently, I've been involved in a discussion group that is reading Thomas Hobbes'  magnum opus , Leviathan.  Personally, I'm coming from this work from two different angles: first, I'm pursuing a description of Bushian neoconservatism as "an overenthusiastic reading of Hobbes' Leviathan" and second, I'm tracing for myself Alexander Campbell's Enlightenment milieu.  Anyway, the following quote comes from Leviathan 5.3:   "...so is it in all debates of what kind soever: and when men that think themselves wiser than all others, clamour and demand right reason for judge; yet seek no more, but that things should be determined, by no other men's reason but their own, it is as intolerable in the society of men, as it is in play after trump is turned, to use for trump on every occasion, that suite whereof they have most in their hand.  For they do nothing else, that will have every of their passions, as it comes to bear sway in them, to be taken for right reason, and that in their own controversies: bewraying [revealing] their want of right reason, by the claim they lay to it.   A stinging rebuke of a political and religious dogmatism...

      This will probably be the first of several comments/quotations from this book by John Mark Hicks and Greg Taylor (Leafwood Publishers, 2003).  Anyway, here's a gem from Martin Luther:  "Your baptism is nothing less than grace clutching you by the throat: a grace-full throttling, by which your sin is submerged in order that ye may remain under grace.  Come thus to thy baptism.  Give thyself up to be drowned in baptism and killed by the mercy of thy dear God, saying: 'Drown me and throttle me, dear Lord, for henceforth I will gladly die to sin with thy Son.'"  More later...

      In a fit of haste and impetuosity (that I will probably regret later), I've created a blog.  Is it just self-absorbed navel-gazing?  Probably.  Will anyone care?  Probably not.    Maybe anonymity will work to my advantage.    Anyway, if anyone is reading this, expect posts on the usual: politics and religion.  You don't have to agree (you probably won't), but your thoughts will always be appreciated.  XP,  Chris

      A big thanks to  urlLink Travis Stanley  for  urlLink this post  on his " urlLink Blogging with the Saints " site.  St. Ephrem's respect and humility before the text would serve us well when we start  urlLink to obsess  about  urlLink every detail  of the Genesis account.

      According to an article in today's  urlLink Washington Post , the Bush administration worries that Americans just aren't as scared as they should be.   These people constantly talk about protection and "homeland" security, but when it comes right down to it, this man's re-election is based upon fear, upon convincing people that we need him to protect us from our worst nightmares.    I'm thankful that God calls his children to be "peacemakers" (Matthew 5.9) and to "live in love" (Ephesians 5.2).  One of the NT writers said that "perfect love casts out fear" (1 John 4.18).   I'll take that path; Mssrs. Bush and Cheney can take theirs.

      So, I've been reading Richard Weaver's trenchant  Ideas Have Consequences .  There are plenty of snippets that I could share but here's one that encapsulates alot of my thinking about the purpose and direction of my life as an academic.   The split in the theory of knowledge which took place at the time of the Renaissance is enough to account for that form of ignorance which is egotism.  Under the worldview possessed by medieval scholars, the path of learning was a path to self-deprecation, and the  philosophiae doctor  was the one who had at length seen a rational ground for  humilitas ...An opposing conception comes in with Bacon's "knowledge is power."  If the aim of knowledge is domination, it is hardly to be supposed that the possessors of knowledge will be indifferent to their importance.  On the contrary,  they begin to swell; they seek triumphs in the material world (knowledge being meanwhile necessarily degraded to skills) which inflate their egotism and self-consideration.  Such is a brief history of how knowledge passes from a means of spiritual redemption to a basis for intellectual pride.  As I've gone through college and, now, through the first few years of graduate study, I've discovered the paradox that the more I learn, the less I know.  And, as Weaver indicates, that is the beginning of humility.  None of this is to toot my own horn.  But I have noticed in so many churches a fear of higher education that springs (I think) from a fear of how the educated handle their knowledge (with arrogance, with contempt of others).  So, it remains for me and for all who pursue higher education to consider how we use our knowledge and the responsibility that that knowledge places upon us.
