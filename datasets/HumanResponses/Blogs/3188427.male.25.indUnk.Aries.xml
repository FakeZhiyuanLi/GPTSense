      This tool extends explorer with functionality of a command prompt. Implemented as a band object completely in C#. Demonstrates COM Interop and P/Invoke, windows hooking and API interception. Finally you can run all these .Net SDK tools and ‘Hello World!’ programs without leaving explorer shell.

      Default AssemblyVersion build and revision numbers - By Omar Shahine   The other day I was wondering where the AssemblyVersion build and revision numbers come from if you use the default synax in your AssemblyInfo files:  // // Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values: // // Major Version // Minor Version  // Revision // Build Number // // You can specify all the value or you can default the Revision and Build Numbers  // by using the '*' as shown below:  [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]  Well it turns out that the build number is set to the number of days since a  random, designated start date, and the revision based on the number of  seconds since midnight.  It's interesting that it took 15 or so minutes on google to find this post that has this little nugget.   Feedback by  Ryan Gregg    I'm not sure Random is a good way of putting it. It is a specified date, by default Jan 1 2000. It can however be changed in the registry to a different date.   I didn't know revision came that way, and that's strange, because the number always seemed so random to me.

      Getting week number in dot net is so easy. We should use System.Globalization.GregorianCalendar object which has GetWeekOfYear method : -  public static int WeekNumber(DateTime dt)  { System.Globalization.GregorianCalendar gCal=new System.Globalization.GregorianCalendar(); return gCal.GetWeekOfYear(dt, System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule.FirstDay, System.DayOfWeek.Monday); }

      Asp buttons have a property accesskey which is similar to hotkey. You can press alt key with the accesskey to invoke click event of the button. But there's one problem. It does not underline the accesskey in the button text. But it can be achieved using html server control as follows: -  &lt;button id="underlineName" type="button"&gt;&lt;u&gt;N&lt;/u&gt;ame&lt;/button&gt;  May be i will create an control based on asp button with underline access key. Some day....

      It is not possible to implement embedded images using MailMessage object.  For supporting embedded images in html, the image should be attached with a content-disposition as "inline" and supplied a unique content-id. This content-id is then referenced as source to the image tag as follows: -   &lt;img src="cid:&lt;&lt;your unique content-id&gt;&gt;"/&gt;  In order to implement it, you can : - * Use third party components like aspNetEmail, which i think is not free. * Or have links to external images, which is much better as it will keep mail size to minimum. * Or create your own component for sending e-mail using SMTP RFC commands.  CP to rescue. There's already an  urlLink e-mail component by Steaven Woyan  available on CP which supports embedded images.

      I came across this  urlLink tool , which claims that along with blocking pop-ups, it also blocks the text-based ads from Google.   My first reaction was great tool. But then I thought, wouldn't it be unethical since by subscribing to  urlLink Google , one is agreeing to its privacy policy which clearly states that user will see text ads and links to relevant ads and people are paying to show them.  Is it really unethical or there is no reason to care as long as such tools serve the purpose.

      Some useful tips by Suzanne Cook on App.config: -  - Forces the v1.0 CLR to be run. If the v1.0 CLR is not installed, the app will fail to run. - Redirects “assemblyName, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=25283151a234958d“ to version 2.0.0.0 of that assembly. This is only useful for strongly-named assemblies, since versions don't matter for those that are simply-named. - Redirects “assemblyName, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=8968ee41e78ce97a“ to codebase “http://www.yourwebsite.com/filename.dll“. 'Href' can also be set to something like “file:///c:/localfile/filename.dll“. Note that redirecting to a codebase causes a System.Net.WebPermission or System.IO.FileIOPermissionAccess.Read + PathDiscovery demand when loading that assembly.

      In his blog, Mikhail Arkhipov asks why most web pages are formatted in portrait orientation when the monitor size is 4:3 or 16:9 wide. There were several reasons given by readers like it follows magzine layouts or readability i.e. there is a ratio between line spacing and line length beyond which your eyes will have troubles finding the start of the next line, and reading becomes much harder. But the comments by Dimitri Glazkov were more accurate. He writes: -  There is no such thing as portrait orientation of a Web site, as there is no such thing as landscape orientation.   The most intuitive principle of reading an electronic document has always been "you read horizontally and scroll vertically" (unless you are a navigational weirdo like creators of  urlLink http://www.korg.com/ ).   Thus, the horizontal size (width) of the page is typically dictated by the size of your output device (monitor), whereas the vertical size (height) is not constrained and depends on the size of the content.   Ideally, this should mean that on wider output devices you would see more content horizontally and scroll less.   Unfortunately, building a "liquid" HTML template that will stretch correctly and still deliver an enjoyable reading experience is rather tricky.   That is why a lot of Web site designers forego the liquid stretching thing altogether. At this point, they fix the width of their template at some lowest denominator, so that all of the content is visible horizontally on most people's monitors.   Today, the magic number is 762px or so, to accommodate the 800x600 resolution.   Naturally, when you look at a page this wide on one of those larger monitors that we developers covet so much, the layout will appear as portrait.

      The event model in the .NET Framework is based on having an event delegate that connects an event with its handler. When you create an EventHandler delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event.  i.e. to raise an event for button click the (auto-generated by designer) code would be like this: -   this.button1.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.button1_Click);   And to un-associate the event with your event handler: -   this.button1.Click -= new System.EventHandler(this.button1_Click);

      A useful utility to Convert VS.NET 2003 Project Files By dacris on CodeProject  From the article: -  Here is a step-by-step description of the changes that happen when you convert a project from VS 7.1 to VS 7.0.  1. In SLN files, the 8.0 must be replaced with 7.0.  2. In vcproj files (and only vcproj), the 7.10 part must be replaced by 7.0. Note: The   portion of MC++ projects will be incompatible with VS.NET 2002 since it uses #using statements from 'stdafx.h'.  3. In VB.NET or C# project files, 7.10.3077 is replaced with 7.0.9466.  4. Also in VB.NET and C# projects, the schema version 2.0 should be replaced with 1.0.  5. In RESX files, the types declared are 1.0.5000 and must be replaced with 1.0.3300.  6. Again, in RESX files (binary streams), the base-64 encoded part that describes the version of the stream must also change from LjAuNTAw to LjAuMzMw (basically base-64-encoded versions of 1.0.5000 and 1.0.3300 respectively)   To convert from VS.NET 2002 to VS.NET 2003, just apply this process backwards.

      Recently, I installed Windows XP on my notebook and set theme to Windows XP. Being used to Windows Classic theme, I was having difficulty finding how to lock my machine. Ctrl + Alt + Del opened up task manager. And the shutdown menu didn't list lock computer option. So I googled a bit and found an interesting article by Vic Ferri on  urlLink different ways to Lock Windows XP . From which I came to know that Switch user (WinKey + L) is actually lock computer.

      After installing the latest Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition Beta, I played around a bit by creating a website and a webservice.   Started getting following error:  	"Error while trying to run project: Unable to start debugging on the web server."  It turns out that all my existing websites are using version 2.0 of the framework. I tried using old copy of  urlLink Denis Bauer's ASP.NET Version Switcher  and it works perfectly. Infact it includes v2.0 also in the list. Nice job there Denis.  Another way to fix is using IIS itself. The new installation includes additional tab for ASP.NET in properties option of IIS. This tab allows to select Asp.net version of the framework for the website. And if version 2.0 is selected, it allows to edit configuration settings of the website using a cool utility.  Hmmm, 2005 certainly look interesting !!!

      No I don't have GMail invitation to give out. I don't even have a GMail account. But at  urlLink GMail Machine , people are donating their GMail invite to be given away randomly. One has to keep on refreshing the page untill he/she see's number 1337. I have been trying for three hours without luck. But there is still hope as the number of invites to give out (current 302) is growing at much higher rate than those given out (current 89). So wish me luck. !!!  Cheers
