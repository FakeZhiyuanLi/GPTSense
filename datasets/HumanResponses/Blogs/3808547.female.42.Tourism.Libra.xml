      Sometimes life throws you many curves, twists and turns...we were thrown a curve recently and we had to make a life altering and final decision.  I had twins several years ago almost 6 now to be exact.  My body like my mind must've been in shock for the last 5 years because the Medical world told me that it was impossible to have more children.  That stung because I was young and my husband younger. I was elated at the wonderful gift that I had been given, you see we had wanted two children and we were blessed with two at the same time, but angry that the choice to have more children had been taken away as easily as it had been given to me.  It felt like a bad dream that I thought one day I would wake up from one day and then we would have another healthy little one....years past us by and I didn't wake up. Fast forward to 4 weeks ago....my husband Tom and I were watching 2 and 1/2 Men..Charlie Sheen is going to have a vasectomy...we laughed at the humor,the next night it was According to Jim the same subject....we laughed again and jokingly said how we didn't have to worry about that....dum dee dum dum...next day's Doctor's appointment I wake up from the dream....and I hear Uhm can't explain it but you are ovulating again..AND with your age and history you WILL have another multiple birth(meaning two or MORE) ruh roh said Scooby.....Okay...waking up 4 years ago would've been nice....now was a nightmare.... I was 6 years older, had my life back(well as much as you can with very busy 5 years old twins),my career was taking off again and I LOVE my job..okay so you know the saying watch what you wish for...they forget to add that you will get it but it may take 5 years!  So the fun begins...NOW we have to make "the" decision.  We talk, we talk some more, I offer to have the surgery he offers to have the big "V", we talk some more.  As we are talking and thinking we go on a trip...while on the trip this woman walks up to me as I'm standing in a Restaurant line and says How old are they?  I smile knowing that she too has twins because only another twin mother would ask that question..(thats because the rest of the world asks Are they twins?)I tell her 5 and ask how old are yours....she never asks how did I know she has twins...there is an instant "kinship" there as she says 6 months old we exchange the usual Twin Mom things and I tell her it does get easier I PROMISE..she looks relieved and says THANK YOU I needed to hear that. I knew that she did...I remembered back to those first months when you grasp hold to any kind words and all words of wisdom from others that have been given the blessing of twins.  As the breakfast progresses I look over at my girls carrying on a conversation with their cousin, they are in a deep discussion with her about Pocohantas(we are eating at the Pocahontas Waffle House)and my husband and I get to carry on a conversation as well...I glance down at my "sister" with the 6 month old twins and she's bouncing one on her lap and rocking the other in the carrier...our food arrives and I watch as my two "big girls" cut up their pancakes and eat them....and I actually get to eat, enjoy, and finish my meal...I glance down again at my "sister" and her food is getting cold in front of her as she tries to feed one of the girls a bottle, juggle the other all the while trying to grab a bite here and there.  It all comes clear to me. The decision is made.  One of us will have surgery but which one.  I'm older, he's younger...if something happens to me he "could" have more children with someone else...if something happens to him...well I'm too old now so I'm the logical choice. Have you ever looked at someone and in one moment loved them more than you ever thought possible. That happened to me.  My husband wouldn't hear of me having surgery because it is easier on him than on me.  He made the appointment and said it was a done deal.  If I didn't already know how much he loves me I knew at that moment. He would do ANYTHING for me even having his "manhood" cut upon. The next few weeks were filled with jokes and poking fun all the while I was SO proud of him and felt like the luckiest woman alive.  So now it's my turn at the humor and comedy...I try to talk him into selling his "nads" afterall after the surgery is done....they aren't gonna be worth anything right and the going "rate" was suppose to be 36,000.00 per nad...In my mind I see $$$ and think of how we can spend the 72G's...I tease him unmercifully about it...all the while I'm SO proud and lucky...I name all the things that we can get for his "nads" he doesn't see the humor as he grins each time I tease him....I keep it up because it is SO rare that "I" get one over on him...and YES I enjoyed teasing him Very very much. So it's snip snip time...we go the night before to the "city" where the "deed" will be done.  We check in to the hotel and head out to dinner.  We choose a Japanese Steakhouse...after a Buddha or two(really good fruity drinks)the irony hits me and I can't stop laughing...I tease him and say the Japanese cook works at the Restaurant part time...his "real" job is to do the big "V" at the hospital that is actually next door.  He watches with a pained expression and a grin as the "chef" slices and dices the filet...any bets as to what is going through Tom's mind?!  We laugh so hard I'm almost in tears and he says well I'll be alright tomorrow unless I hear the sound of those knives.  I'm feeling pretty proud of myself too at the moment...afterall what other wife would treat their husband to a nice meal at a Japanese steakhouse to watch the show of slicing and dicing meat right before he is to have his manhood  sliced,snipped,clipped, tied, and stitched! The time has come...we have to have a consultation to make sure that we understand that this IS a permanent and FINAL thing.....can you say Duh Huh why do you think we are there...uhm it BETTER be permanent and final..I mean Tom wasn't there because he didnt' have anything better to do that Friday.....so we are waiting for the Nurse Practioner to come in and "talk"  the next thing we hear is all of this banging, and something hitting the floor that sounds like the knives...I burst into gales of laughter and say,"Told you the little Japanese man works here"!  We laughed so hard that I was almost in tears..then I start teasing him that they are going to staple his incision closed(after all I had to have staples with my C-section and my gallbladder surgery...why not with this..men have all the luck)and try one last time to get him to sell his nads for extra cash....tease him about being in stirrups and darn it they didn't even use those...men have all the luck although he wasn't feeling too lucky right at this moment.   A snip snip here a snip snip there here a snip there a snip...the deed is done..we are handed a speciman jar and sent on our way. For later accumulations At this moment I am SO proud of him and love him more than anything for what he has done to protect me from having to go through surgery....I want to baby him but he is walking fine,walking tall and proud, and saying it was a breeze..asks to go shopping at Old Navy he's seen some clothes on the internet that he wants. Now he is a da Man! MY Man! So off we go...we shop and then go to Hooters for lunch...I figure he deserves the scenery after what he has done for me. Once we arrive home he goes to bed, puts his feet up and wraps frozen peas in places where no pea has dared to go before but they WORK to keep the swelling down! Being the southern hostess that I am I had a good supply of frozen peas already on hand for Layered salads to serve at summer picnics.  Now of course everytime someone we know eats the salad and compliments me on how good it is Tom and I will just look at each other politely say "thank you" and grin...for we KNOW where those peas have been! So the moral of the story is when life throws you a curve, sends you around an unexpected bend, or gives you bags of peas..make Layered Salad by laughing, joking, and loving each other.  A dear friend told me that "you and Tom" always have SO much fun..even getting a Vasectomy you make fun...well I'm not real sure just how much fun it was for him.....
