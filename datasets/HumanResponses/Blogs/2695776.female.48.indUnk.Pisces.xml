						   February 28, 2004   TO: 	Capital One Services 	P.O. Box 85015 	Richmond, VA 23285-5015   Acct#:	xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx  Subject: Dissatisfaction with services purchased with Capital One credit card.  Under the Special Rule For Credit Card Purchases, I am writing to dispute the charge of $780.00 by the merchant Midwest Moving & Storage, posted to my account on 1/31/2004. The company's movers permanently damaged four items of my property. Three of those items have been rendered unusable and will have to be replaced at MY expense.   I reported the incident to the company's Claims Representative (see attached). His response was that because I selected the "30 cents per pound per article valuation" at the time of the move, they would reimburse me a total of only $21.90 for the damage to all four of the items. I was not offered the opportunity to purchase a higher level of insurance. I fully expected that my property would be handled and delivered in the same condition it was before the move. The damage to the particular items was a direct result of the movers' negligence in handling the items. Their negligence is further amplified by the fact that they managed to destroy a light fixture in the ceiling of the apartment I was moving into.   Because of the extensive damage to my property due to the movers' negligence, based on what I estimate it will cost to replace or repair the items, and because of the company's refusal to resolve this problem in a more equitable manner, I dispute and refuse to pay more than their minimum charge for the move: $480.00 (120/Hr X 4-hour minimum). To avoid finance charges, I will remit the full amount of $480.00 by the next "Payment Due Date" of March 24, 2004.   For your information, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau against this company on Friday 2/27/2004 (Complaint #1406628).   Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.  Sincerely,

						   Submitted at BBB website, 2/27/04   This moving company permanently damaged 4 items of my personal property. Three of the 4 items are beyond repair and are now unusable.   I filed a claim (and cover letter) with the company. Their response was a very curt letter and a check for $21.90, in accordance with their "30 cents per pound/article" policy which I agreed to at the time of the move. Had I known how careless the movers would be, I would certainly have opted for better insurance coverage to protect my property. Not only did they damage my personal property (a dinette chair, a floor lamp, a dresser, and a side table), they broke a ceiling light fixture at the move destination.   The company reps did NOT contact me to try and resolve the matter to MY satisfaction. It will certainly cost me more than $21.90 to repair/replace the items they damaged/destroyed. At a minimum, this company is guilty of false advertising. On their website (www.midwestmoving.com) they claim "People Expect The Best and We Deliver". Based on their claim, I expected my property to be delivered in the condition it was when they picked it up. Instead, four items were delivered broken and/or damaged. Three of those items are damaged beyond repair and are now unusable. AND, during the move-in, they completely destroyed a light fixture at the new location! For all this, they compensated me for only $21.90?!?!?!? It will cost me MUCH more than that to repair/replace the items they damaged/destroyed!   I paid the cost of the move with a credit card. As is my right under the "Special Rule for Credit Card Purchase" I will contact the credit card merchant to withhold payment for Midwest Moving's services.   Thank you for any assistance you can provide.

						   February 12, 2004   Michael Jackson Claim Representative  urlLink Midwest Moving and Storage, Inc.  1255 Tonne Road Elk Grove Village, IL 60007   Dear Mr. Jackson:  Enclosed is the completed Loss/Damage claim form listing the items that were lost/damaged during my move on January 30, 2004. I am writing to further explain/clarify the damage to these items.  1. Fanback Dinette Chair This is one of only 2 chairs of a 3-piece matching dinette set. Since the chairback is broken in two, the chair cannot adequately support the weight of an average-size adult. Though the 2 pieces can probably be glued back together, it will never be as strong as the matching chair. The individual chair cost me $46.00 five years ago. I would be surprised if I could purchase a replacement for that same price.   2. Torchiere Floor Lamp The metal connector that connects the light pole to the base, was completely broken off the base. Consequently the lamp cannot stand on its own, as it was designed to do. Since the connector itself was broken off and lost during the move, I will have to replace the entire lamp. Also, the matte paint finish on the outside of the metal reflector shade has been badly scraped/scarred. This lamp was also purchased 5 years ago for about $29.99. (Unfortunately I don’t have the store receipt.) I suspect it will cost me more than that to replace it. The store I purchased it from no longer carries the item.   3. Double Dresser Front Rail This dresser belonged to my grandmother and is over 30 years old. Though it is not a particularly expensive piece, it has survived several previous moves without damage. During this recent move, a portion of the front rail was somehow separated and will need to be reattached.  4. Three-Leg Round Table A day or so after the move, I discovered that a 2-headed screw (threads at each end), required to attach one of the 3 legs of the table, was missing. The other 2 screws remained screwed into the table legs. I suspect the third screw somehow became dislodged during the move and was lost. The legs were removed by one of the three movers assigned to the job, prior to moving the pieces (Upper and lower surfaces, plus 3 legs) to the moving truck. The table is unusable with only 2 legs. I have no idea where I might find the special 2-headed screw I would need to attach the 3rd leg.    In addition to the damage to my personal property, the movers broke a glass light bulb cover installed in the ceiling of the hallway in my apartment. This happened when they were bringing a queen-size box spring into the apartment. The glass cover was shattered into about 100 pieces of varying size. Fortunately, the building management has agreed to replace the cover at no charge to me. However I am reporting it to you to illustrate the carelessness of the movers.   Mr. Jackson, I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Because of the current condition of the dinette chair, the floor lamp and the round table, I cannot possibly enjoy the full use of these items. They need to be repaired or replaced as soon as possible.  Sincerely,

						   March 29, 2004   TO: 	Capital One Card Center 	P.O. Box 85520 	Richmond, VA 23286-9175 Attn:   Customer Relations Representative   Amount of Disputed Charge: $300.00  Following and/or attached is the information you requested via your letter of March 16, 2004: 1. Capitol One account number: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx 2. Merchant name: Midwest Moving & Storage, Date of disputed transaction: 1/30/04, Dollar amount in dispute: $300.00 of the total charge of $780.00. 3. Copy of documentation supporting services I was supposed to receive: Attached - obtained from merchant's web site (www.midwestmoving.com). Other than what I obtained from the merchant's web site, I did not receive ANY documentation of services prior to the move. Based on the merchant's slogan as shown on their web site ("People expect the best and we deliver"), and the testimonials posted on their web site, I had a reasonable expectation that my property would be handled in the manner one would expect from a PROFESSIONAL moving company. The negligence shown by these movers is what I would expect from unpaid amateurs.  4. Copy of contract/invoice that details work performed: Attached. 5. Last date I contacted the merchant: 2/12/04. Description of merchant's response: A brief, callous letter and their check for $21.90. 6. Copy of the merchant's refund policy: Attached - I suppose this would be the statement of "Mover's Liability" included on the invoice and reiterated on the merchant's response letter. I would like to point out that the moving crew leader (who visually inspected my property before moving it) recommended that I agree to the 30 cents per pound/article. Apparently he did not feel it was necessary for me to purchase a higher level of insurance.  7. Signed letter from another certified moving specialist stating what the original merchant did incorrectly or improperly: The moving specialist I contacted (Hollander Moving & Storage) declined to write such a letter. Their position was that since I did not take out a higher level of insurance (beyond the minimum basic 30 cents per pound/article) I am not entitled to anything beyond that amount. As I stated above and in my previous letter, I was not offered the option to purchase additional insurance.  It is quite obvious what was done improperly/incorrectly:  The chair back was damaged because the chair was stacked upside down on top of the matching chair. The chair back of the upturned chair is longer than the legs of the chair it was placed on (seat-to-seat). In this stacked position, there is about 4-5 inches of space between the 2 seats and the top of chair back (a space of about 3 inches) is resting directly on the floor. Any weight placed on the stacked chairs would result in undue pressure on the top part of the chair back causing it to break.   The floor lamp was broken away from the base because it was not secured properly at some point during the move. I overheard one of the movers say it was knocked over as it sat in the loading area while other items were being loaded into the truck.  The 3-legged round table was damaged because the movers lost the special screw that is needed to attach one of the 3 legs. Since they are the ones who decided to dismantle it, they should have taken care to keep up with the hardware needed to reassemble it.  The dresser was damaged because some force was applied to the narrow rail causing it to separate from the dresser. I suspect this is from trying to move it by pulling it rather than pushing using the end of the rail for leverage.  The light fixture was damaged because the movers were not paying attention to the height of the bed frame as they carried it into the apartment, in relation to the height of the ceiling and the location of the light fixture even though the light was on.  8. Amount in dispute: $300.00 of the total charge of $780.00.  9. Copy of final receipt: Attached - refund check stub for "Claim Settlement".   I hope this information is sufficient to finalize resolution of the disputed charge.   Sincerely,

						   March 1, 2003  Ms. Stacy Pristas Property Manager Windsor at Ontario Place Chicago, IL 60611   Dear Ms. Pristas:   I am writing to inform you of a serious problem I had with my recent move from Ontario Place. I reserved a moving crew from the company you use, Midwest Moving & Storage. During the move, the movers damaged four items of my furniture. Three of those items were rendered unusable. (There was also minor damage to a few other items, however I chose not to include those items in the claim because they are easily repairable/replaceable.) Attached is the letter I filed with my claim to Midwest Moving, that provides details of the damage. Please note that in addition to the damage to my personal property, they also broke the cover of a light fixture installed in the ceiling of the apartment I moved into at Presidential Towers.   The company's Claims Manager (Michael Jackson) recently responded with a letter reminding me that I selected the "30 cents per pound per article valuation" and as such, included a check for a mere $21.90. I find that amount unacceptable since the damage was a direct result of the movers' negligence and carelessness in loading, unloading, and/or transporting the items from the moving truck. I am pursuing the matter through the Better Business Bureau and because of my high level of dissatisfaction with the service the company provided, I am disputing and refusing to pay $300.00 of the $780.00 moving cost charged to my credit card.   Ms. Pristas, I strongly urge you to discontinue using the services of Midwest Moving for Ontario Place tenant moves.  Obviously, the movers they use are quite careless in their handling of a customer's property. They certainly did NOT handle my property in the manner I would expect from any professional moving company.  (By the way, this is the same company that moved me from Unit #2203 to #2305 at Ontario Place last year. During that move, two of the four wheels on a file cabinet were broken off and lost. During this move, the remaining two wheels were broken off and lost. But at least the cabinet sits level now and I can still use the drawers.)  As you consider your decision, keep in mind that Midwest Moving's performance and quality of work reflects on you and Ontario Place management, since they are your company of choice for in-house moves and move-out arrangements.    Thank you for your consideration.   Deena M. Bogan Former Tenant

						   Ms. Latrice James Personal Services Dispute Specialist Better Business Bureau of Chicago 330 N. Wabash Ave., Suite 2006 Chicago, IL 60611  RE: 33018291 - Midwest Moving and Storage, Inc.   Dear Ms. James:  In response to your letter of March 31, 2004 regarding my complaint against the above-named company, the company has not satisfactorily resolved my complaint against. them. In fact they have not contacted me in any way, shape or form since I filed my complaint with the BBB. However, as I said I would in my initial complaint, I contacted the credit card company to which I had charged the $780.00 moving charge. I disputed and refused to pay $300.00 of the total charge. As of my most recent statement from the credit card company,  the $300.00 (plus finance charges) has been deducted from my balance. I consider THAT a satisfactory resolution for the damage to my property caused by Midwest Moving.   While I have your attention, I would like to point out that I originally filed my complaint via the BBB Online Complaint System on February 27, 2004. Attached is a copy of the confirmation email I received from that system. Please note the Complaint #: 1406628. This is a different number than the one printed on the letter I received from you and referenced above.    Earlier today I went to the Chicago BBB web site to look up the status of my complaint. There was nothing for the number you gave on your letter to me: 33018291. When I looked up the complaint using the complaint number assigned by the Online Complaint System - 1406628 - the status information was displayed. I've attached a copy of the Status page printout. Please note that the Status page printout says the company has 10 business days to respond, with a Due Date of 4/21/2004. Ten (10) business days from March 31st would be April 14th. The 4/21/2004 date seems to allow for the 14 business days from March 31st that you stated in your letter to me. The 10 days versus 14 days is a glaring inconsistency that needs to be corrected.   Sincerely,

						   Description of the Loss and Damage caused by the mover is stated in the attached correspondence I sent to the mover on February 12th and June 5th of this year.   My claim can be settled by the mover issuing a credit to my Capital One Visa account for the remaining $284.10 amount in dispute. (Capital One Visa is the account to which the original $780.00 moving charge was billed.

						   June 5, 2004   TO: 	Capital One Card Center 	P.O. Box 85520 	Richmond, VA 23286-9175 Attn:   Customer Relations Representative   Re:	xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx Amount of Disputed Charge: $300.00   Dear Representative:  I do not know why, but this disputed charge has been posted to my account as of my most recent statement. As of March 29, 2004 the charge had been removed and I provided the supporting documentation requested by S. Lyon to support my contention. Since I did not receive any further correspondence from Mr./Ms. Lyon, I thought the matter was resolved. I would appreciate an explanation of why this disputed charge has been re-posted to my account.   In the meantime, the merchant - Midwest Moving & Storage - arranged for a repairperson to come to my apartment and try to repair the damaged items on 4/26/04. I have reason to believe that effort was merely to save their status/reputation with the Better Business Bureau. However, the repair effort resulted in destroying one of the damaged items.   Attached is a copy of my correspondence to the merchant regarding the disputed $300.00 charge. Please note that I have offered to pay only $15.90 of the disputed $300.00 charge that has been re-billed to my account. Once again, as is my right under the "Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases" I am invoking my right NOT to pay $284.10 of the charge. I have made an offer to the merchant to pay $15.90 of the charge.  I dispute the remaining $284.10, and per the attached correspondence I intend to escalate the matter as necessary. Separately, I would appreciate your explanation of why the $300.00 charge was re-billed to my account, without any prior notice.   Sincerely,

						   June 5, 2004  Mark Nykaza  urlLink Midwest Moving & Storage, Inc.  1255 Tonne Rd. Elk Grove Village, IL 60007  CC: Luis Toledo  Re: Job #87819-01  Mr Nykaza:  According to my recent credit card statement from Capital One, your company has re-submitted the $300.00 charge I disputed as a result of the damage to my property caused by your company's negligence and carelessness. While I appreciate the effort you made to correct the situation by having Mr. Snitkowsky repair the damaged items, the repairs he made were no better than if I'd done them myself. In fact, the floor lamp he repaired toppled over after 10 hours of letting the glue dry. The metal lamp shade is now bent into the shape of a taco and the halogen bulb broke off in the socket. The lamp is now completely unusable. As for the chair, there is a visible scar where the two pieces were glued together. The same is true for the dresser.  The only item that was restored to its original condition was the 3-legged table. Nevertheless, in order to close this matter I will agree to pay only $15.90 of the outstanding $300.00. The $15.90 represents the settlement amount you refunded to me, not including the floor lamp which was further damaged by Mr. Snitkowsky's repair effort. I will notify my credit card company accordingly - specifically, that I dispute and refuse to pay the remaining $284.10.   If my offer of $15.90 is not acceptable to you, I am prepared to escalate the matter by filing a complaint with the American Moving & Storage Association, and if necessary to escalate it further by requesting arbitration to resolve and settle this matter.    Your company/your movers did a very shoddy job of transporting my property. Items were damaged at some time during the move. The movers caused further damage by breaking a ceiling light fixture at the destination/delivery location. If everything had gone smoothly and nothing was damaged, then you would certainly be entitled to the full amount of the $750.00 moving charge. But everything did NOT go smoothly - items and fixtures were damaged through your movers' carelessness and negligence. Attempts to repair one of the damaged items (the floor lamp) resulted in completely destroying the item. For these reasons, I will agree to pay ONLY $15.90 of the $300.00 balance.    Your company did NOT do a satisfactory moving job and I am certain that the only reason you hired Mr. Snitkowsky to try to repair the damaged items was to maintain your status/certification with the Better Business Bureau. Had I known you would continue to recover the full $300.00 balance that my credit card company had already deducted, I would have notified the Better Business Bureau accordingly.   You do NOT deserve to be paid the full amount of the moving charge as if you had done a reasonably acceptable and satisfactory job. You DIDN'T, and I refuse to pay you as if you did.   Sincerely,

						   July 7, 2004  Apparently my request for arbitration to the America Moving and Storage Association (AMSA) was forwarded to Midwest Moving. Today, the rep from MWM (Mark N.) called to politely inform me that the America Moving and Storage Association was NOT the appropriate agency to pursue this matter with. He suggested I contact the Illinois Movers and Warehouseman's Association to pursue the matter.  Apparently the AMSA thinks it's OK for a moving company to bust up a your furniture if you are naïve enough to sign off your shipment at the 30 cents per pound/per article rate. Had I known this company's movers would be so careless, irresponsible, negligent, and unprofessional I would not have bothered with paying for additional insurance. I would have hired a different company altogether!!!   Ah well, the fight WILL continue! I certainly will contact the IMWA to file a complaint and/or request arbitration.
