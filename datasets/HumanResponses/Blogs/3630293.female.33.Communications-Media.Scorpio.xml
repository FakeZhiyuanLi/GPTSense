      The President spoke at 9:02 P.M. from the Oval Office at the White House. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television.   .................................................................   This is the 34th time I'll speak to you from the Oval Office and the last. We've been together 8 years now, and soon it'll be time for me to go. But before I do, I wanted to share some thoughts, some of which I've been saving for a long time.   It's been the honor of my life to be your President. So many of you have written the past few weeks to say thanks, but I could say as much to you. Nancy and I are grateful for the opportunity you gave us to serve.   One of the things about the Presidency is that you're always somewhat apart. You spent a lot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving, and seeing the people through tinted glass--the parents holding up a child, and the wave you saw too late and couldn't return. And so many times I wanted to stop and reach out from behind the glass, and connect. Well, maybe I can do a little of that tonight.   People ask how I feel about leaving. And the fact is, `parting is such sweet sorrow.' The sweet part is California and the ranch and freedom. The sorrow--the goodbyes, of course, and leaving this beautiful place.   You know, down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the part of the White House where the President and his family live. There are a few favorite windows I have up there that I like to stand and look out of early in the morning. The view is over the grounds here to the Washington Monument, and then the Mall and the Jefferson Memorial. But on mornings when the humidity is low, you can see past the Jefferson to the river, the Potomac, and the Virginia shore. Someone said that's the view Lincoln had when he saw the smoke rising from the Battle of Bull Run. I see more prosaic things: the grass on the banks, the morning traffic as people make their way to work, now and then a sailboat on the river.   I've been thinking a bit at that window. I've been reflecting on what the past 8 years have meant and mean. And the image that comes to mind like a refrain is a nautical one--a small story about a big ship, and a refugee, and a sailor. It was back in the early eighties, at the height of the boat people. And the sailor was hard at work on the carrier Midway, which was patrolling the South China Sea. The sailor, like most American servicemen, was young, smart, and fiercely observant. The crew spied on the horizon a leaky little boat. And crammed inside were refugees from Indochina hoping to get to America. The Midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship and safety. As the refugees made their way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor on deck, and stood up, and called out to him. He yelled, `Hello, American sailor. Hello, freedom man.'  A small moment with a big meaning, a moment the sailor, who wrote it in a letter, couldn't get out of his mind. And, when I saw it, neither could I. Because that's what it was to be an American in the 1980's. We stood, again, for freedom. I know we always have, but in the past few years the world again--and in a way, we ourselves--rediscovered it.   It's been quite a journey this decade, and we held together through some stormy seas. And at the end, together, we are reaching our destination.   The fact is, from Grenada to the Washington and Moscow summits, from the recession of '81 to '82, to the expansion that began in late '82 and continues to this day, we've made a difference. The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two things that I'm proudest of. One is the economic recovery, in which the people of America created--and filled--19 million new jobs. The other is the recovery of our morale. America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership.   Something that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of this. It was back in 1981, and I was attending my first big economic summit, which was held that year in Canada. The meeting place rotates among the member countries. The opening meeting was a formal dinner of the heads of goverment of the seven industrialized nations. Now, I sat there like the new kid in school and listened, and it was all Francois this and Helmut that. They dropped titles and spoke to one another on a first-name basis. Well, at one point I sort of leaned in and said, 'My name's Ron.' Well, in that same year, we began the actions we felt would ignite an economic comeback--cut taxes and regulation, started to cut spending. And soon the recovery began.   Two years later, another economic summit with pretty much the same cast. At the big opening meeting we all got together, and all of a sudden, just for a moment, I saw that everyone was just sitting there looking at me. And then one of them broke the silence. 'Tell us about the American miracle,' he said.  Well, back in 1980, when I was running for President, it was all so different. Some pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe. Our views on foreign affairs would cause war. Our plans for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about economic collapse. I even remember one highly respected economist saying, back in 1982, that `The engines of economic growth have shut down here, and they're likely to stay that way for years to come.' Well, he and the other opinion leaders were wrong. The fact is what they call `radical' was really `right.' What they called `dangerous' was just `desperately needed.'  And in all of that time I won a nickname, `The Great Communicator.' But I never though it was my style or the words I used that made a difference: it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things, and they didn't spring full bloom from my brow, they came from the heart of a great nation--from our experience, our wisdom, and our belief in the principles that have guided us for two centuries. They called it the Reagan revolution. Well, I'll accept that, but for me it always seemed more like the great rediscovery, a rediscovery of our values and our common sense.   Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on something, the people will produce less of it. So, we cut the people's tax rates, and the people produced more than ever before. The economy bloomed like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and stronger. Our economic program brought about the longest peacetime expansion in our history: real family income up, the poverty rate down, entrepreneurship booming, and an explosion in research and new technology. We're exporting more than ever because American industry because more competitive and at the same time, we summoned the national will to knock down protectionist walls abroad instead of erecting them at home.   Common sense also told us that to preserve the peace, we'd have to become strong again after years of weakness and confusion. So, we rebuilt our defenses, and this New Year we toasted the new peacefulness around the globe. Not only have the superpowers actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons--and hope for even more progress is bright--but the regional conflicts that rack the globe are also beginning to cease. The Persian Gulf is no longer a war zone. The Soviets are leaving Afghanistan. The Vietnamese are preparing to pull out of Cambodia, and an American-mediated accord will soon send 50,000 Cuban troops home from Angola.   The lesson of all this was, of course, that because we're a great nation, our challenges seem complex. It will always be this way. But as long as we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves, the future will always be ours. And something else we learned: Once you begin a great movement, there's no telling where it will end. We meant to change a nation, and instead, we changed a world.   Countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free speech and turning away from the ideologies of the past. For them, the great rediscovery of the 1980's has been that, lo and behold, the moral way of government is the practical way of government: Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly productive.   When you've got to the point when you can celebrate the anniversaries of your 39th birthday you can sit back sometimes, review your life, and see it flowing before you. For me there was a fork in the river, and it was right in the middle of my life. I never meant to go into politics. It wasn't my intention when I was young. But I was raised to believe you had to pay your way for the blessings bestowed on you. I was happy with my career in the entertainment world, but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to protect something precious.  Ours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government, and with three little words: `We the People.' `We the People' tell the government what to do; it doesn't tell us. `We the People' are the driver; the government is the car. And we decide where it should go, and by what route, and how fast. Almost all the world's constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are. Our Constitution is a document in which `We the People' tell the government what it is allowed to do. `We the People' are free. This belief has been the underlying basis for everything I've tried to do these past 8 years.   But back in the 1960's, when I began, it seemed to me that we'd begun reversing the order of things--that through more and more rules and regulations and confiscatory taxes, the government was taking more of our money, more of our options, and more of our freedom. I went into politics in part to put up my hand and say, `Stop.' I was a citizen politician, and it seemed the right thing for a citizen to do.   I think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping. And I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited. There's a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics: As government expands, liberty contracts.   Nothing is less free than pure communism--and yet we have, the past few years, forged a satisfying new closeness with the Soviet Union. I've been asked if this isn't a gamble, and my answer is no because we're basing our actions not on words but deeds. The detente of the 1970's was based not on actions but promises. They'd promise to treat their own people and the people of the world better. But the gulag was still the  gulag, and the state was still expansionist, and they still waged proxy wars in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.   Well, this time, so far, it's different. President Gorbachev has brought about some internal democratic reforms and begun the withdrawal from Afghanistan. He has also freed prisoners whose names I've given him every time we've met.   But life has a way of reminding you of big things through small incidents. Once, during the heady days of the Moscow summit, Nancy and I decided to break off from the entourage one afternoon to visit the shops on Arbat Street--that's a little street just off Moscow's main shopping area. Even though our visit was a surprise, every Russian there immediately recognized us and called out our names and reached for our hands. We were just about swept away by the warmth. You could almost feel the possibilities in all that joy. But within seconds, a KGB detail pushed their way toward us and began pushing and shoving the people in the crowd. It was an interesting moment. It reminded me that while the man on the street in the Soviet Union yearns for peace, the government is Communist. And those who run it are Communists, and that means we and they view such issues as freedom and human rights very differently.   We must keep up our guard, but we must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust. My view is that President Gorbachev is different from previous Soviet leaders. I think he knows some of the things wrong with his society and is trying to fix them. We wish him well. And we'll continue to work to make sure that the Soviet Union that eventually emerges from this process is a less threatening one. What it all boils down to is this: I want the new closeness to continue. And it will, as long as we make it clear that we will continue to act in a certain way as long as they continue to act in a helpful manner. If and when they don't, at first pull your punches. If they persist, pull the plug. It's still trust by verify. It's still play, but cut the cards. It's still watch closely. And don't be afraid to see what you see.   I've been asked if I have any regrets. Well, I do.The deficit is one. I've been talking a great deal about that lately, but tonight isn't for arguments, and I'm going to hold my tongue. But an observation: I've had my share of victories in the Congress, but what few people noticed is that I never won anything you didn't win for me. They never saw my troops, they never saw Reagan's regiments, the American people. You won every battle with every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action. Well, action is still needed. If we're to finish the job. Reagan's regiments will have to become the Bush brigades. Soon he'll be the chief, and he'll need you every bit as much as I did.   Finally, there is a great tradition of warnings in Presidential farewells, and I've got one that's been on my mind for some time. But oddly enough it starts with one of the things I'm proudest of in the past 8 years: the resurgence of national pride that I called the new patriotism. This national feeling is good, but it won't count for much, and it won't last unless it's grounded in thoughtfulness and knowledge.   An informed patriotism is what we want. And are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world? Those of us who are over 35 or so years of age grew up in a different America. We were taught, very directly, what it means to be an American. And we absorbed, almost in the air, a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions. If you didn't get these things from your family you got them from the neighborhood, from the father down the street who fought in Korea or the family who lost someone at Anzio. Or you could get a sense of patriotism from school. And if all else failed you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture. The movies celebrated democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special. TV was like that, too, through the mid-sixties.   But now, we're about to enter the nineties, and some things have changed. Younger parents aren't sure that an unambivalent appreciation of America is the right thing to teach modern children. And as for those who create the popular culture, well-grounded patriotism is no longer the style. Our spirit is back, but we haven't reinstitutionalized it. We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom--freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise. And freedom is special and rare. It's fragile; it needs production [protection].   So, we've got to teach history based not on what's in fashion but what's important--why the Pilgrims came here, who Jimmy Doolittle was, and what those 30 seconds over Tokyo meant. You know, 4 years ago on the 40th anniversary of D-day, I read a letter from a young woman writing to her late father, who'd fought on Omaha Beach. Her name was Lisa Zanatta Henn, and she said, `we will always remember, we will never forget what the boys of Normandy did.' Well, let's help her keep her word. If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are. I'm warning of an eradication of the American memory that could result, ultimately, in an erosion of the American spirit. Let's start with some basics: more attention to American history and a greater emphasis on civic ritual.   And let me offer lesson number one about America: All great change in America begins at the dinner table. So, tomorrow night in the kitchen I hope the talking begins. And children, if your parents haven't been teaching you what it means to be an American, let 'em know and nail 'em on it. That would be a very American thing to do.   And that's about all I have to say tonight, except for one thing. The past few days when I've been at that window upstairs, I've thought a bit of the `shining city upon a hill.' The phrase comes from John Winthrop, who wrote it to describe the America he imagined. What he imagined was important because he was an early Pilgrim, an early freedom man. He journeyed here on what today we'd call a little wooden boat; and like the other Pilgrims, he was looking for a home that would be free. I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it, and see it still.   And how stands the city on this winter night? More prosperous, more secure, and happier than it was 8 years ago. But more than that: After 200 years, two centuries, she still stands strong and true on the granite ridge, and her glow has held steady no matter what storm. And she's still a beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.  We've done our part. And as I walk off into the city streets, a final word to the men and women of the Reagan revolution, the men and women across America who for 8 years did the work that brought America back. My friends: We did it. We weren't just marking time. We made a difference. We made the city stronger, we made the city freer, and we left her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.   And so, goodbye, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

      (Yankee Stadium 1939)  Fans, for the past two weeks you have been reading about the bad break I got. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the fact of the earth. I have been in ballparks for seventeen years and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans.   Look at these grand men. Which of you wouldn't consider it a highlight of his career just to associate with them for even one day? Sure I'm lucky. Who wouldn't consider it an honor to have known Jacob Rupert? Also, the builder of baseball's greatest empire, Ed Barrow? To have spent the next nine years with that wonderful little fellow, Miller Huggins? Then to have spent the next nine years with that outstanding leader, that smart student of psychology, the best manager in baseball today, Joe McCarthy? Sure, I'm lucky.   When the New York Giants, a team you would give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift --- that's something.  When everybody down to the groundskeepers and those boys in white coats remember your trophies --- that's something.  When you have a wonderful mother-in-law who takes sides with you in squabbles with her own daughter --- that's something.  When you have a father and mother who work all their lives so you can have an education and build your body --- it's a blessing.   When you have a wife who has been a tower of strength and shown more courage that you dreamed existed --- that's the finest I know.   So I close in saying that I may have had a tough break, but I have an awful lot to live for.

      YTL Group managing director Tan Sri (Dr) Francis Yeoh returns to his alma mater Kingston to receive an Honorary Degree Doctor of Engineering. Speaking to the graduates at the Faculty of Technology graduation ceremony, he advised them: “We must not only harness the mind, we must also harness our hearts to re-engineer the world of man and bring it back to sanity and productive endeavour. Let us not suffer from spiritual amnesia. Let us build together a lasting world full of goodness, an everlasting Empire of the Minds with Heart.”  ------------------------------------------  London, 12 February 2004  FULL TEXT OF SPEECH BY TAN SRI (DR) FRANCIS YEOH  It is a great pleasure to be speaking here today before what for me is a very special audience to thank you for the honour you do me, which I humbly accept on behalf of YTL, on behalf of my family and on behalf of my country.  W.H. Auden once said: “When I find myself in the company of scientists, I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into a drawing room full of Dukes.   Although I obtained a civil engineering degree from Kingston I have to confess as an engineer I am now somewhat of a dinosaur having become a businessman. But to coin a well-worn phrase, you can take a man out of engineering but you can’t take engineering out of the man. I like to think I conduct my business with the instincts and the disciplined approach of engineering such as you taught me at this great Institute.    This occasion is also a nostalgic one for me.  Looking at all the young hopefuls gathered here today to receive their degrees, I go back to that other young hopeful - a young (Malaysian) Chinese lad, who traveled 8,000 miles to study engineering at Kingston.  We were the immediate post World War II generation.  In our generation hope was the first article of faith.  I was young and idealistic. (My wife reminds me I am still young and even more idealistic today). We were liberated from conflict. We had seen the triumph of good over evil and been given a new lease of life.  Then came that spectacular moment, when the Americans put the first man on the moon.  It was a dramatic illustration of the scientific advance of our generation and the power of technology.  And we were all able to share the moment, wherever we were, thanks to those other early advances in I.T.  I felt proud to have chosen engineering as my field of study – the most relevant of disciplines to mankind’s increasing mastery of his environment, and what seemed its limitless capability to create new wonders for the betterment of the world.  I still believe in that relevance - I quoted Auden just now. What he also had to say is pertinent to my continuing belief despite my deep respect and reverence to statesmen of global stature.  Auden said: “The true men of action in our time, those who transform the world are not the politicians and statesmen, but the scientists”.    I have kept my passion for technology. Today YTL owns and manages regulated infrastructure assets and utilities globally, servicing 10 million customers. My civil engineering background backed by the intellectual capital of four other siblings who are also civil engineers certainly gave us the added confidence and knowledge to handle what would otherwise be a complicated and complex business.   However, in today’s world the mastering of the language of brick and mortar is no longer adequate. Today’s dominant alphabet no longer codes in twenty-six letters but in two ... they are of course, in 1s and 0s. The digital alphabet that encodes and transmits information with extraordinary speed and accuracy has become the world’s main language.  Indeed only with the extensive employment of ICT to complement our brick and mortar infrastructure are we able to successfully service our 10 million customers, twenty four hours a day, everyday of the year.  Please remember well, customers do vote with their feet.  Science and technology allow people to multiply their productivity much faster than those who do not have the same knowledge.  And now the difference between what one person produces in the richest and the poorer countries in the world is 390 to 1.  And with the IT and genetics revolutions, the difference will soon be 1,000 to 1.  And this is why the great empires of the twenty-first century are and will remain “The Empires of The Mind”.  Societies that turn their back on technologies and stop building Empires of The Mind will perish!  We accept the fate of societies that fails to build Empires of the Mind, what is the fate of societies that turn their backs to build Empires of the Heart?  In today’s troubled world we need more than technology. It is my belief that technology on its own will not save the day. A new word has gained currency in recent years - re-engineering. We need to re-engineer the global community. If we tackle the root causes of injustice and deprivation we will create a better life for all. We need to renew our faith in that Great Engineer – the Creator of the Universe, our Lord God.   As a Christian, I believe that our universe itself was designed and executed by a great engineering intelligence. Chet Raymo, an astronomer calculated the odds of our universe resulting: If all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the Earth were possible universes and only one of those grains of sand were a universe that allowed for the existence of intelligent life, then that one grain of sand is the universe we inhabit. Therefore life on this earth is a miracle and our gathering here today is even more miraculous for me.    While we celebrate the advances of technology, unfortunately technology also played a part in 911 and the terrorist aftermath.  Globalisation has made it possible for a handful of fanatics to hold the world to ransom and technology gives them more advanced weapons.    Chesterton observed: The Greeks, the great guides and pioneers of pagan antiquity, started out with the idea of something splendidly obvious and direct; the idea that if man walked straight ahead on the high road of reason and nature, he could come to no harm or flippantly put,  he has to simply follow his nose. The truth is when he follows his nose, he manages somehow to put his nose out of joint, or even to cut off his nose to spite his face.   It is no surprise that in today’s troubled world, Yancey observed that technology repeats the cycle of Adam and Eve, Prometheus, Icarus and Pandora.  We master the atom and nearly obliterate ourselves.  We learn the secrets of life only to develop techniques to destroy the unborn and the aging.  We unlock the genetic code and open a Pandora’s box of ethics.  We harvest rain forests and create floods, harness internal combustion and melt the icecaps.  We link the world on an Internet only to find that the most downloaded items are pornographic.  Every advance seems to induce a greater fall.  As a Christian, I believe I am a mere steward of God’s wealth.  Whilst He writes the scripts we are His potential powerful pencils. We must therefore not only harness the mind, we must also harness our hearts to re-engineer the world of man and bring it back to sanity and productive endeavour. Let us not suffer from spiritual amnesia. Let us build together a lasting world full of goodness, an everlasting Empire of the Minds with Heart.  May I congratulate the graduates here today and wish you well in your chosen careers. I hope it will be as rewarding for you as it has been for me.  My only advice is to keep your enthusiasm alive and your faith intact. Once again I thank you for honouring me and I give my Lord Jesus all the glory.   May God bless all of you in your future endeavours. Thank you very much.   SPEECH BY TAN SRI (DR) FRANCIS YEOH  ON THE CONFERMENT OF HON. DEGREE DOCTOR OF ENGINEERING  BY THE KINGSTON UNIVERSITY  12 FEBRUARY 2004

      By Butch Jimenez  Butch Jimenez, head of PLDT's media and strategic communications  department, delivered this speech at the UP Diliman Class 2003 commencement exercises.  .................................................................  Better than being negative.  As college students, you're just about to set sail into the real world. As you prepare for the battleground of life, you'll hear many speeches, read tons of books and get miles of advice telling you to work hard, dream big, go out and do something for yourself, and have a vision.  Not bad advice, really. In fact, following these nuggets of truth may just bring you to the top. But as I've lived my life over the years , I have come to realize that it is great to dream big, have a vision, make a name, and work hard. But guess what: There's something better than that.  So my message today simply asks the question, What's better than...?  Let's start off with something really simple. What's better than a long speech? No doubt, a short one. So, you guys are in luck because I do intend to keep this short.  Now, let me take you through a very simple math exam. I'll rattle off a couple of equations, and you tell me what you observe about them. Be mindful of the instructions. You are to tell me what you observe about the equations.  Here goes: 3+4=7, 9+2=11, 8+4=13, and 6+6=12. Tell me, what do you observe?  Every time I conduct this test, more than 90 percent of the participants immediately say, 8 + 4 is NOT 13, it's 12!  That's true and they are correct. But they could have also observed that the three other equations were right. That 3+4 is 7, that 9+2 is 11, and that 6+6 is 12.  What's my point? Many people immediately focus on the negative instead of the positive. Most of us focus on what's wrong with other people more than what's right about them. Examine those four equations. Three were right and only one was wrong. But what is the knee-jerk observation? The wrong equation.  If 10 people you didn't know were to walk through that door, most of you would describe those people by what's negative about them. He's fat. He's balding. Oh, the short one. Oh, the skinny girl. Ahhh, 'yung pango. Etc.   Get the point? It's always the negative we focus on and not the positive. You'll definitely experience this in the corporate world. You do a hundred good things and one mistake-guess what? Chances are, your attention will be called on that one mistake.  So what's better than focusing on the negative? Believe me, its focusing on the positive. And if this world could learn to focus on the positive more than the negative, it would be a much nicer place to live in.  Better than working hard. We have always been told to work hard. Our parents say that, our teachers say that, and our principal says that. But there's something better than merely working hard. It's working SMART.  It's taking time to understand the situation, and Coming out with an effective and efficient solution to get more done with less time and effort. As the Japanese say, "There's always a better way."  One of the most memorable case studies I came across with as I studied Japanese management at Sophia University in Tokyo was the case of the empty soap box, which happened in one of Japan's biggest cosmetics companies. The company received a complaint that a consumer had bought a box of soap that was empty. It immediately isolated the problem to the assembly line, which transported all the packaged boxes of soap to the delivery department. For some reason, one soap box went through the assembly line empty. Management tasked its engineers to solve the problem. Post-haste, the engineers worked hard to devise an X-ray machine with high-resolution monitors manned by two people to watch all the soap boxes that passed through the line to make sure they were not empty. No doubt, they worked hard and they worked fast.   But a rank-and-file employee that was posed the same problem came out with another solution. He bought a strong industrial electric fan and pointed it at the assembly line. He switched the fan on, and as each soap box passed the fan, it simply blew the empty boxes out of the line. Clearly, the engineers worked hard, but the rank-and-file employee worked smart. So what's better than merely working hard? It's working smart. Having said that, it is still important to work hard. If you could combine both working hard and working smart, you would possess a major factor toward success.  Better than dreaming big I will bet my next month's salary that many have encouraged you to dream big. Maybe even to reach for the stars and aim high. I sure heard that about a million times right before I graduated from this university. So I did. I did dream big. I did aim high. I did reach for the stars. No doubt, it works. In fact, the saying is true: "If you aim for nothing, that's exactly what you'll hit: nothing."  But there's something better than dreaming big. Believe me, I got shocked myself. And I learned it from the biggest dreamer of all time, Walt Disney.  When it comes to dreaming big, Walt is the man. No bigger dreams were fulfilled than his. Every  leadership book describes him as the ultimate dreamer. In fact, the principle of dreaming and achieving is the core message of the Disney hit song, "When You Wish Upon a Star".  "When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are; anything your heart desires will come to you. if your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme. When you wish upon a star, as dreamers do," as Jiminy Crick et sang.  But is that what he preached in the Disney company? Dream? Imagineering. Well, not exactly. Kinda, but not quite. The problem with dreaming is if that's all you do, you'll really get nowhere. In fact, you may just fall asleep and never wake up.  The secret to Disney's success is not just dreaming, it's IMAGINEERING. You won't find this word in a dictionary. It's purely a Disney word. Those who engage in imagineering are called imagineers. The word combines the words "imagination" and "engineering."  In the book "Imagineers," Disney's CEO, Michael Eisner, claims that "imaginers turn impossible dreams into real magic."  Walt Disney explained there is really no secret to their approach. They just keep moving forward-opening new doors and doing new things, because they are curious. And it is this curiosity that leads them down new paths. They always dream, explore and experiment. In short, imagineering is the blending of creative imagination and technical know-how.  Eisner expounds on this thought by saying that "Not only are imaginers curious, they are courageous, outrageous, and their creativity is contagious."  The big difference with imagineers is that they dream and then they DO! So don't just be a dreamer, be an imagineer.  What's better than vision.  You must have all been given a lecture at one time or another about the importance of having a vision. Even leadership expert John Maxwell says that an indispensable quality of a leader is to have a vision. The Bible also makes it very clear that "Without vision, people perish." So no doubt about it, having a vision is important to success. But surprise! There's something more potent than a vision. It's a CAUSE. If all you're doing is trying to reach your vision and you're pitted against someone fighting for a cause, chances are you'll lose.   The Vietnam War is a classic example. Literally with sticks and stones, the Viet Cong beat the heavily armed US Army to surrender, primarily because the US had a vision to win the war, but the Vietnamese were fighting for a cause.  In the realm of business, many leaders have visions of making their company No.1, or grabbing market share, or forever increasing profits.   Nothing really wrong with that vision, but take the example of Sony founder Akio Morita. He did not just have a vision to build the biggest electronics company in the world. In his biography, "Made in Japan," he reveals that the real reason he set up Sony was to help rebuild his country, which had just been battered by war. He had a cause he was fighting for.  His vision to be an electronics giant was secondary.   What's the difference between a vision and a cause? Here's what sets them apart... No one is willing to die for a vision. People will die for a cause. You possess a vision. A cause possesses you. A vision lies in your hands. A cause lies in your heart. A vision involves sacrifice. A cause involves the ultimate sacrifice.  Just a word of caution. You must have the right vision, and you must be fighting for the right cause. In the end, right will always win out.  It may take time, and it may take long. But if you have the right vision and are fighting for the right cause, you will prevail. If not, no matter how sincere you are, if you are not fighting for what is right, you will ultimately fail.  Having been given the opportunity to study in UP, no doubt, much has been given to you in terms of an excellent education. Don't forget that in return, much is now required of you to use that education not just for yourself, but for others.  And as you move up and start reaching the pinnacle of success, even more will be required of you to look at the welfare of others, of society and of the country.  A final review:   What's better than focusing on the negative? Focus on the positive.  What's better than working hard? It's working smart.   What's better than dreaming? Imagineering.   What's better than doing something for yourself? Doing something for your country.   What's better than a vision? A cause.   What's better than a long speech? Definitely, a short one.  Thank you and congratulations, UP Diliman graduating class of 2003.  "Excellence is not a destination; it is a continuous journey that never ends."

      By Guy Kawasaki   (Guy Kawasaki was on Apple Computer's Macintosh development team. He delivered this speech to the graduates of Palo Alto High School on 6/11/95.)  *****************************************************************  Speaking to you today marks a milestone in my life. I am 40 years old. 22 years ago, when I was in your seat, I never, ever thought I would be 40 years old. The implications of being your speaker frighten me. For one thing, when a 40 year old geezer spoke at my baccalaureate ceremony, he was about the last person I'd believe. I have no intention of giving you the boring speech that you are dreading. This speech will be short, sweet, and not boring.  I am going to talk about hindsights today. Hindsights that I've accumulated in the 20 years from where you are to where I am. Don't blindly believe me. Don't take what I say as "truth." Just listen. Perhaps my experience can help you out a tiny bit. I will present them ala David Letterman. Yes, 40-year old people can still stay up past 11.  10: Live off your parents as long as possible.  When I spoke at this ceremony two years ago, this was the most popular hindsight-except from the point of view of the parents. Thus, I knew I was on the right track. I was a diligent Oriental in high school and college. I took college-level classes and earned college-level credits.  I rushed through college in 3 1/2 years. I never travelled or took time off because I thought it wouldn't prepare me for work and it would delay my graduation.  Frankly, I blew it. You are going to work the rest of your lives, so don't be in a rush to start. Stretch out your college education. Now is the time to suck life into your lungs-before you have a mortgage, kids, and car payments. Take whole semester off to travel overseas. Take jobs and internships that pay less money or no money. Investigate your passions on your parent's nickel. Or dime. Or quarter. Or dollar. Your goal should be to extend college to at least six years. Delay, as long as possible, the inevitable entry into the workplace and a lifetime of servitude to bozos who know less than you do, but who make more money. Also, you shouldn't deprive your parents of the pleasure of supporting you.  9 Pursue joy, not happiness.  This is probably the hardest lesson of all to learn. It probably seems to you that the goal in life is to be "happy." Oh, you maybe have to sacrifice and study and work hard, but, by and large, happiness should be predictable. Nice house. Nice car. Nice material things. Take my word for it, happiness is temporary and fleeting. Joy, by contrast, is unpredictable. It comes from pursuing interests and passions that do not obviously result in happiness. Pursuing joy, not happiness will translate into one thing over the next few years for you: Study what you love. This may also not be popular with parents. When I went to college, I was "marketing driven." It's also an Oriental thing. I looked at what fields had the greatest job opportunities and prepared myself for them. This was brain dead. There are so many ways to make a living in the world, it doesn't matter that you've taken all the "right" courses. I don't think one person on the original Macintosh team had a classic "computer science" degree.  You parents have a responsibility in this area. Don't force your kids to follow in your footsteps or to live your dreams. My father was a senator in Hawaii. His dream was to be a lawyer, but he only had a high school education. He wanted me to be a lawyer.  For him, I went to law school. For me, I quit after two weeks. I view this a terrific validation of my inherent intelligence.  8: Challenge the known and embrace the unknown.  One of the biggest mistakes you can make in life is to accept the known and resist the unknown. You should, in fact, do exactly the opposite: challenge the known and embrace the unknown.  Let me tell you a short story about ice. In the late 1800s there was a thriving ice industry in the Northeast. Companies would cut blocks of ice from frozen lakes and ponds and sell them around the world. The largest single shipment was 200 tons that was shipped to India. 100 tons got there unmelted, but this was enough to make a profit.  Companies that invented mechanical icemakers, however, put these ice harvesters, out of business. It was no longer necessary to cut and ship ice because companies could make it in any city during any season. Refrigerator companies, however, put these icemakers, out of business. If it was convenient to make ice at a manufacturing plant, imagine how much better it was to make ice and create cold storage in everyone's home. You would think that the ice harvesters would see the advantages of ice making and adopt this technology. However, all they could think about was the known: better saws, better storage, better transportation.  Then you would think that the icemakers would see the advantages of refrigerators and adopt this technology. The truth is that the ice harvesters couldn't embrace the unknown and jump their curve to the next curve. Challenge the known and embrace the unknown or you'll be like the ice harvester and icemakers.  7: Learn to speak a foreign language, play a musical instrument, and play non-contact sports.  Learn a foreign language. I studied Latin in high school because I thought it would help me increase my vocabulary. It did, but trust me when I tell you it's very difficult to have a conversation in Latin today other than at the Vatican. And despite all my efforts, the Pope has yet to call for my advice. Learn to play a musical instrument. My only connection to music today is that I was named after Guy Lombardo. Trust me: it's better than being named after Guy's brother, Carmen. Playing a musical instrument could be with me now and stay with me forever. Instead, I have to buy CDs at Tower.  I played football. I loved football. Football is macho. I was a middle linebacker-arguably, one of the most macho positions in a macho game. But you should also learn to play a non-contact sport like basketball or tennis. That is, a sport you can play when you're over the hill. It will be as difficult when you're 40 to get twenty two guys together in a stadium to play football as it is to have a conversation in Latin, but all the people who wore cute, white tennis outfits can still play tennis. And all the macho football players are sitting around watching television and drinking beer.  6: Continue to learn.  Learning is a process not an event. I thought learning would be over when I got my degree. It's not true. You should never stop learning. Indeed, it gets easier to learn once you're out of school because it's easier to see the relevance of why you need to learn.  You're learning in a structured, dedicated environment right now. On your parent's nickel. But don't confuse school and learning. You can go to school and not learn a thing. You can also learn a tremendous amount without school.  5: Learn to like yourself or change yourself until you can like yourself.  I know a forty-year-old woman who was a drug addict. She is a mother of three. She traced the start of her drug addiction to smoking dope in high school. I'm not going to lecture you about not taking drugs. Hey, I smoked dope in high school. Unlike Bill Clinton, I inhaled. Also unlike Bill Clinton, I exhaled. This woman told me that she started taking drugs because she hated herself when she was sober. She did not like drugs so much as much as she hated herself. Drugs were not the cause though she thought they were the solution. She turned her life around only after she realised that she was in a downward spiral. Fix your problem. Fix your life. Then you won't need to take drugs. Drugs are neither the solution nor the problem.  Frankly, smoking, drugs, alcohol-and using an IBM PC-are signs of stupidity. End of discussion.  4: Don't get married too soon.  I got married when I was 32. That's about the right age. Until you're about that age, you may not know who you are. You also may not know whom you're marrying. I don't know one person who got married too late. I know many people who got married too young. If you do decide to get married, just keep in mind that you need to accept the person for what he or she is right now.  3: Play to win and win to play.  Playing to win is one of the finest things you can do. It enables you to fulfil your potential. It enables you to improve the world and, conveniently, develop high expectations for everyone else too. And what if you lose? Just make sure you lose while trying something grand. Avinash Dixit, an economics professor at Princeton, and Barry Nalebuff, an economics and management professor at the Yale School of Organisation and Management, say it this way: "If you are going to fail, you might as well fail at a difficult task.  Failure causes others to downgrade their expectations of you in the future. The seriousness of this problem depends on what you attempt." In its purest form, winning becomes a means, not an end, to improve yourself and your competition.  Winning is also a means to play again. The unexamined life may not be worth living, but the unlived life is not worth examining. The rewards of winning-money, power, satisfaction, and self-confidence-should not be squandered. Thus, in addition to playing to win, you have a second, more important obligation: To compete again to the depth and breadth and height that your soul can reach. Ultimately, your greatest competition is yourself.  2: Obey the absolutes.  Playing to win, however, does not mean playing dirty. As you grow older and older, you will find that things change from absolute to relative. When you were very young, it was absolutely wrong to lie, cheat, or steal. As you get older, and particularly when you enter the workforce, you will be tempted by the "system" to think in relative terms. "I made more money." "I have a nicer car." "I went on a better vacation." Worse, "I didn't cheat as much on my taxes as my partner." "I just have a few drinks. I don't take cocaine." "I don't pad my expense reports as much as others." This is completely wrong. Preserve and obey the absolutes as much as you can. If you never lie, cheat, or steal, you will never have to remember who you lied to, how you cheated, and what you stole. There absolutely are absolute rights and wrongs.  1: Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone.  This is the most important hindsight. It doesn't need much explanation. I'll just repeat it: Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone. Nothing-not money, power, or fame-can replace your family and friends or bring them back once they are gone. Our greatest joy has been our baby, and I predict that children will bring you the greatest joy in your lives-especially if they graduate from college in four years.  And now, I'm going to give you one extra hindsight because I've probably cost your parents thousands of dollars today. It's something that I hate to admit to. By and large, the older you get, the more you're going to realise that your parents were right. More and more-until finally, you become your parents.  I know you're all saying, "Yeah, right." Mark my words. Remember these ten things: if just one of them helps you helps just one of you, this speech will have been a success:  10: Live off your parents as long as possible. 9: Pursue joy, not happiness. 8: Challenge the known and embrace the unknown. 7: Learn to speak a foreign language, play a musical instrument, and play non-contact sports. 6: Continue to learn. 5: Learn to like yourself or change yourself until you can like yourself. 4: Don't get married too soon. 3: Play to win and win to play. 2: Obey the absolutes. 1: Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone.

      This was an article written by Marina Mahathir in The Star's recent Musings column. Everything she says is so true, only she can get away with it! Enjoy...  The Star August 20, 2003   Not Always Boleh  by Marina Mahathir  AS we reach our 46th birthday and cries of "Malaysia Boleh" ring out, we should really reflect on this a bit. I am one of those who always find these constant shouts of "Malaysia Boleh" a bit tiresome. Not to be a spoilsport or anything, it's just that sometimes our focus on what we boleh (can) seems rather shallow. I have great admiration for Malaysians who can sail solo around the world, climb Everest, explore Antarctica and brave the English Channel. These are truly great feats and the glory achieved by them reflects on us, and motivates others to try and do similar things. What I have some problem with are the types of Malaysia Boleh feats that have to do with creating the longest popiah, the most number of teh tarik pulls, the most number of sticks of satay eaten, etc. No doubt everyone wants his or her 15 minutes Of fame, but after that, what? Will the person who ate the most number of durians ever be featured in Hari Ini dalam Sejarah?  As we all scramble to get into some book of records for things we boleh do, I wonder if we ever reflect on the things we tak boleh (cannot) do?  Here is a partial list, in no particular order:  We tak boleh talk about many things because they are deemed too sensitive for some unknown people's ears. Thus, there are so many things swept under the carpet now that we can hardly walk without tripping.  We tak boleh complain about how some people in authority behave. We tak boleh show affection to our loved ones in public because some people think it's obscene.  The women among us tak boleh feel safe in public because if something happens to us, it's always our fault.  We tak boleh be trusted to decide for ourselves whether a movie is good or bad.  We women tak boleh look at pictures of women's bodies in women's magazines; they have to be blacked out.  Young people tak boleh be given information about the many bad things that could happen to them even though this could save their lives. Universities tak boleh be left with more women students because this may lead to a very empowered population of women. And what's more they may start demanding that women be given vice-chancellor posts!  We tak boleh ask why the authorities have some ruling or other because then they may actually have to think of a good reason for them.  We tak boleh, tak boleh, tak boleh talk about religion even though sometimes the implementation of religious rulings can make our lives miserable.  We tak boleh complain when cars are triple parked on Fridays because,hey, what is a human law when they're breaking it to commune with God?  We tak boleh be sure anything we do will be judged on its own merits; we must get some VIP to help us.  We tak boleh excel in many things, including sports, because someone will tell us why we tak boleh do it (too difficult, not nice, not feminine, too much work, no money in it, etc).  We tak boleh point out the contradictions in our society because it's, well, embarrassing (like, how come we're so religious and so superstitious at the same time?).  We tak boleh teach our kids to think because then they may ask us too many questions.  We tak boleh act as if we would like to think about things too, and then give our opinion.  We tak boleh trust our young people even though one day, whether we like it or not, they will take over the country (unless we turn them into clones of us of course).  We tak boleh deny the fact that Siti Nurhaliza is a lot more influential than most politicians (who else can sell out a lipstick by just mentioning it?). But then Siti tak boleh make our lives miserable.  We tak boleh talk back, unless we couch it in polite terms. Never mind that the person we want to talk back to has been very rude.  Every day it seems we are encouraged to do things to prove we are the best, biggest, brightest. But rarely are we ever encouraged to be thinking and compassionate human beings with opinions of our own, especially if those opinions are different from the norm. Are we to show Malaysia Boleh only in harmless non-threatening ways even though these often have no long-term benefit? Or should we really be challenging ourselves in our minds and hearts?

      Speech by TUN DAIM ZAINUDDIN   I was appointed two years ago as lecturer but I regret that until today I have not delivered a single lecture. Just as in the case of students who don't attend a single lecture, this University has asked me to repeat my term for another two years.   I have not chosen any special topic for my lecture but as this was an invitation from the business school, I thought it appropriate that we talk about running and managing a business.  As I am no expert,I can only base it on my own personal experience.   I retired in 1977 after making my money. I thought I deserved a rest so I took time off, went back to university to study, to recharge my batteries, but before long, the then Deputy PM asked me to come back to help at UDA.  I came back and started Peremba. I also went back to business but this time, I found a new area to make money _ the stock market but don't let anyone tell you that that is the easiest path to making money. It was as worrisome as when I was in Maluri. In 1984, I joined the government and in compliance with government directives, I had to sell all my shares including shares in a bank. As 1984_1985 were the years of recession, I had to sell at very low prices. I could have realized more from my assets if our economy was not in recession.   I left in 1991, after seven years as Finance Minister. I went back into business, back to the same playing field that I was very familiar with. Whilst I am now actively back in business, I also give free advice to those who sought my advice.   While I have been successful, Alhamdulillah, I cannot guarantee you will succeed based on my advice. But those who have worked with me in Peremba Tan Sri Azmi, Razali, Dato Halim, Hassan, Dato Samsudin Hassan have all become millionaires in their own right. No company has produced so many successful people that Peremba was dubbed "the University of Peremba". I don't know if they followed my guidelines but I know they all worked very hard when they were with me. There are other Bumis and Non-Bumis who sought advice and help from me and are now very successful. I shall not mention their names as I do not want to take credit for their success. I am happy for them.   Some of you I am sure would like to know if you follow faithfully what I have to say, would that be a guarantee for success? In life, the only guarantee is death. Let's face it. If all of you go out from here and straight away go into business, not all will succeed. My advice is merely a guideline and unless you try, you will never know the ultimate result.   For tonight's lecture, I suggest I spend half the time talking and the balance for a question and answer session.  This way, we will be able to exchange views. While I will talk to you about business in general, I will focus specifically on Malay Business.    Notwithstanding common misconceptions, Malays have been involved in business for centuries. Malays were traders trading with Sumatra, Java, China and India. However, the British policy of economic segregation coupled with their immigration labour policy led to the concentration of Malays in the agricultural sector. With Merdeka and the economic boom activities of the 50s and 60s, the Malays were not content to remain in the kampongs while the wealth of the country was in the hands of foreigners and non-Malays. Their discontentment erupted in 1969. Then came the NEP. The NEP was not formulated to provide for handouts and charity to the Malays. It was a vehicle to level the playing field for the Malays, to enable them to catch up with their more advanced fellow citizens. Even in golf, if you are a beginner playing with a more experienced person, you are given a handicap.   The NEP has produced many Malays who are successful in business and in other economic and non-economic endeavours. Now we have many Malays who are millionaires and billionaires. How did they become successful in business? Yes, there was the NEP that gave Malays the chance but not all Malays who went into business are successful there are just as many bankrupt Malays.   The question you should ask before you embark on any business venture is whether you really want to succeed.  If the answer is positive, ask yourself how strong is your desire to succeed?  Do you have the strength, stamina and discipline to succeed? Are you prepared to give your all, your time and money and are you prepared to work and study to achieve your ambition?  If again the answers are positive, you have the makings of a successful person. These qualities segregate the successful ones from those who fail.   There is no magic formula to starting and maintaining a successful business. You start with the technicalities and practicalities of starting a business. Whether to have a sole proprietorship, a partnership or a company, each has its own pros and cons, its own risks and benefits. Then you have to think about office space, location, staff, support equipment, factory space and land, as the case may be. All these cost money and it is not, I repeat, not necessary to ensure success that you must have a big office, many staff and a Mercedes Benz.  These are burdens that you don't need when you are starting. The time for fancy cars and a fancy office will come later, if you insist that you must have them, but remember to make your money first before spending it. I shall tell you a secret _ you also do not need to play golf to be successful. (If you do not believe me, you can ask the Prime Minister.)   What kind of business should you get into? What would determine your choice? You look, you read, you listen, but in the end you have to make your own decision. You have to decide.  You may like some businesses but they make little money. In some, there is big money but you may not like it. But remember, you go into business to make money. No one wants to go into business to end up a bankrupt.  However, there is no point in going into a business that you have absolutely no interest in.  You can't run a sports shop if you can't tell a badminton racquet from a squash racquet, nor be a contractor if you can't stand being out in the sun. You must like what you are doing, it must interest you when you start and hold your interest as you go along.  Work should be satisfying, something you look forward to, otherwise you will give up at the slightest hint of a problem. If, however much you like the business, but it is not profitable, then you have to stop being a dreamer and be practical. If you can marry what you like with what that can make money, then I would say that you are indeed a very lucky person.   To determine whether you are going to be successful in what you are planning to do, you would not go far wrong if you ask yourself what it is that people want or need. If you can meet either their needs or wants, then you are halfway there.   People need the basics of food, clothing and shelter.  People's wants are limitless. If you are in the business of satisfying needs, there will always be a market for your products _ a humble rojak man will still be in business alongside multinationals like McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Whether the rojak man will be just as successful will depend on his product, the rojak. If it offers the right combination of price and quality and a consistency of these two factors, he will in his own way be successful.   The food business is indefinite _ from "mee abu" or the burger stall to conglomerates. You can be a stall owner selling satay or you can set up a chain; you can be a farmer planting padi or you can practise integrated farming where fish and prawn breeding can fetch handsome profits; you can sell beef or lamb at the local market or you can supply and distribute internationally _ think of the Haj when millions of cows and sheep are slaughtered. You can sell fruits by the roadside or you can run fruit plantations. It is the same with other needs and wants of your customer. You are only limited by your imagination and your ability to work hard. If your finished product costs less than your competitor's and has zero defect the market is yours. Once the market is yours you are on the right road.    In my case, I went into the business that answered people's basic needs and wants. First, I went into the salt business _ I thought, what can go wrong? Everybody needs salt. What would our food be like without salt? So my partners and I went to Japan, Thailand and Taiwan to study the process. We studied weather reports to see where we should site our salt fields and factory.  We knew everything there was to know about salt and then we opened our salt fields. Then came the rain and washed away our salt, our hard work and our money. We persevered and tried again but this was followed by the big flood of 1970! We nearly became bankrupts. I had to make that tough decision _ cut losses or continue. I knew my strengths and my limitations and whilst I knew I could control some things in business, the weather was not one of them. So I closed down the business. But I never said die and I never gave up _ so I went into another basic need _ housing.    We identified the land, drew up the plans, then went on the merry-go-round to get approvals. That was not easy at all. We had to deal with so many government departments and financial institutions. It was a very frustrating process. By then, I knew business was not easy. Business is very complex where sometimes one is confronted with problems to which there are no easy answers. But we must not be dismayed if we take a long time to find answers to the questions. We persevered and months later got all the necessary approvals and permits.   Then we were ready to start business. But I was inexperienced and the contractors, architects and engineers knew that this was my first project. I, however, made it clear to them that I may be new at this but I was not stupid. I was at the site every day; I watched everything; I read up; I asked questions and at the end of the day, I lay in bed going over the day's problems and how to solve them. I built Taman Maluri on ex-mining land.  When we were laying the pipes for the sewerage, the engineers suggested that we go 40 ft. down. I knew that if we were to go down 40 ft., we would have water gushing out. I thought about it and suggested that we used pumps instead and it worked. Were they testing me? I don't know but I knew that my solution earned their respect.  I was at the site day and night to solve any problems that could arise. I never put off to tomorrow what I could do today.  Every day of delay costs money. Interest accumulates even when you are sleeping. I was also everything from manager to office boy. I had only three or four staff when I started. One secretary, one messenger boy and one sales staff. I ran a very lean and tight office. The engineers, surveyors, site supervisors, contractors were not my employees but all were engaged as consultants for the project. As such, I need not worry about EPF, SOCSO, medical and insurance benefits. I took no salary but only an allowance to cover my family's needs. I had to keep costs down because until you sell, there is no income.    I was worried that we could not sell the houses. So I made sure that the houses would not only meet the standard of buyers but gave more than they expected, better quality and better design.  We made our roads wider.  We provided a letter box, a place for rubbish; at that time this was something different, something special. Now these are standard features. Where the minimum ceiling requirement was 10 feet, we made it higher.  These things do not cost much more, but it made our houses different and better.   We also made our houses affordable. Our single-storey link was sold at RM17,500; double-storey link at RM48,000.  Alhamdulillah, the houses sold like hot cakes and we have never looked back.  Success tastes even sweeter in the aftermath of failure.   I may have made all this sound simple. All my years of hard work condensed into a few paragraphs. But it was sweat and tears and there were times when I despaired of ever making it _ we faced it all _ from sleepless nights, long hours in the office, begging banks, in particular bank officers, running so often to government departments and sometimes having to deal with petty-minded officers with big egos and big stomachs. We were given the run-arounds enough to test the patience of a saint. I swallowed my pride and learned to be patient. At the beginning, nothing is easy. Things only look simple after you have succeeded and your bank account is no longer in the red.   There is no guarantee, of course, that if you venture into the housing industry, you will succeed. What if the market crashes and buyers withdraw to cut losses? What if consumer tastes change? What if, for example, you have these rows of houses, built and ready but no one buys? If you can sell, you prosper; otherwise you suffer.  These are the challenges that you will face, and you will face challenges in whatever business you choose.   Whether you will be able to weather the challenges really depends on you. You have to face the problems and try to sort them out. Problems have to be solved; they will not go away however much you hope and pray that when you wake up and like magic, they have disappeared. Whether you will be able to solve the problems or not depend on you and your preparation before you even embark on the project. Even if some things are beyond our control, if you have done a thorough study and know your market, the chances are you will have anticipated the problems and be able to solve them. You would have alternative plans and answers. Whilst you see abandoned projects, abandoned factories and businesses, you can also see that some sell even in the worst of time. Why?  Because they know how to read the market _ their product sells, whatever the market or economic condition.   Your organization is also important if you want to succeed in your business. Have a proper organization and draw out a management chart. Authority flows from the top.   It is people that makes your business a success.  Choose the right type. Get those who are hard working, disciplined, dedicated and honest. You can make the stupid learn. But the lazy, you will find them a great burden. Reward your staff for good per-formances.   Take good care of your staff and they will take good care of your business. But the lazy ones must be sacked. Don't allow them to destroy the good ones. Be firm but fair.   Be compassionate to those who are willing learners, but show no leniency to the lazy. Bad influence is like cancer and unless attended to, it will spread easily. Good behaviour is not that easy to acquire. So train your staff to be efficient and cost conscious. Remember in business, there is always competition and competition is good. It keeps you alert and on your toes all the time. Only your costs can decide if you will do well or otherwise. Cost and quality will determine your market share. Control these two and your market is safe. So show them leadership. You must be the first to come and the last to go. After all, it is your organization. You have to lead, be a good leader so that your employees can trust and count on you. If you are playful and undisciplined, the rest of the staff will take their cue from you. If you work hard, they will work as hard. Therefore, instil good qualities, i.e. honesty, hardwork, thrift, discipline and deter-mination; make sure time is never wasted.   Every-thing must be done on time. Remember, time is money.   Other than tight control on staff, you must have a tight control on finance. Discourage waste. Make sure every single cent is accounted for. Remember 100 cents make a dollar. It is from cents that you will make your millions one day. It is your money not your staff's, so you have to be diligent and ensure proper control. Saving money means making money.   You may have the best management team, you may have the finance, you may have the contacts but whether you succeed or fail will still depend on you. You must have in you the qualities that will determine success. What are these qualities?  I believe they are:   First, hardwork, hardwork and more hardwork. Rewards come to those who are willing to work hard. Business is hard work and sacrifices. Don't waste time looking at the clock. There is no such thing as 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes, it is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You may have to give up your leisure and holidays, be on call 24 hours a day, available at any time to make decisions, give directions and solve problems.   You have to be dedicated and have perseverance. It is a sacrifice and if you are not prepared to make the initial sacrifice, you cannot enjoy the benefits later. I have yet to come across a success story with the main character not putting in any effort.   There is no substitute for hard work. Work hard to make your dreams come true. If you believe strongly in what you are doing and want to make it a success, the fight to succeed is worth all your time and sacrifice. Never stop until you succeed.   Second, you must have a passion, a fire in you to do well.  It must keep burning in you until you succeed. The determination to succeed will help to ensure success. Without strong determination, you will be unsure of success. Your strong desire for success will motivate you to work hard.   The determination to succeed is the prime reason many achieve their goals. Success breeds success, and with success comes confidence. If you want something badly enough, it will happen because you will make it happen but it will only happen if you work hard at it. If you want to do something, try it.   Don't be afraid. You must believe you can do anything you want to do. If you work very hard to achieve it, once you set a goal, persevere to accomplish it. You should not accept defeat and refuse to quit even when faced with failure. You may stumble, but if you have the determination, you will get up and move on. You will be conscious of future pitfalls but when you are down, there is no where else to go except up.   Trust your instincts and commonsense. You should know yourself. Have confidence in your decisions, your ability and your judgement; if you believe in yourself, others will too, but if you make a mistake, do not be afraid to admit it and to learn from it. In short, never give up. Never stop learning.   Third, you must have pride in your work but do not be too proud to ask and to learn. Pride in your business is important _ this will urge you to succeed and do well. You must want to be the best in your chosen field. If you have a sense of shame, you will make sure that you will not fail. If you do not want to fail, you will plan well and work hard to ensure that you will not fail.   But do not be too proud to learn from others, to ask for opinions, to seek advice, consult people. Don't be shy. Be prepared to learn. Be humble, be friendly _ you may never know whose help you may need. Be particularly friendly to your bankers. Banks have the habit of asking back for their umbrellas when it rains. If the officers are sympathetic to your problems, you will get another chance.   Fourth, a good education is fundamental. You need education appropriate to your goals. Read everything.  Education does not end when you graduate. If you read, you will learn new things and may even find the answers to your problems.   Read about your business, about management, about finance, about new innovations in the market. Read the law on companies, duties of directors.  Some Malay businessmen want to be directors and at the very least, Managing Directors, if not Chairman. They are under the wrong impression that Directors have no responsibilities other than attending meetings and entertaining people. Read the Companies Act and you will know what it entails being a Director.   The first word of God was "Iqra" _ Read. Read also for pleasure, widen your horizon, do not be a person who is encyclopedic about his business and knows nothing about the world around him. Nurture an intellectual curiosity about everything around you.   Fifth, you must want to be in business and you must love the profession to give your all to it. Some Muslims believe this world is for the non-Muslims, that Muslims should only pray and think of the hereafter. So why go into business and make money? You can't take the money with you when you die. For the Malays and Muslims, we have to change that belief. It is a wrong interpretation of the Islamic faith. I have yet to come across any religion that discourages its followers from doing business.    As long as it is not haram and your business practices are not immoral, I cannot see any reason why Muslims cannot pursue a career in business. As long as in the pursuit of success, you do not forget your religious obligations, I think it is possible to be both a businessman and a good Muslim.   Going into business is to make profits, but your ultimate goal is to improve the quality of life of those around you and to contribute to the nation. It is the people t hat make the country. If they work hard and succeed, then their success is the country's success.  If the people do well, the country will do well, and your contribution to the country's success however small, is an act of charity.   Sixth, you must, like the Boy Scouts, be prepared. You must go in with your eyes open, realistic of the risks and benefits, of the pitfalls that await you. In business, you take risks but you must not be reckless. You must be prepared to face challenges, not be afraid to face problems because you have already anticipated the problems and are prepared to meet them.    With time and practice, you will be able to handle problems with ease; you will acquire the ability to respond to problems, to train yourself to think quick and fast. Like all fields, in the field of business, you need brains to succeed. It is not the strongest or the fastest man or woman for that matter who wins.  It is the person who thinks that wins; therefore be a strategist.    Seventh, Discipline. You must exercise both mental and financial discipline. Discipline also means that you should do today what is needed to be done today no matter how tired you are or how tempting it is to put it off.    Discipline also means that you keep to appointments, to promises, to time, to schedules that you deliver what you say you would, when you say you would; that you honour your word; that you keep to your budget and control your cost; that you are honest notwithstanding the temptations that await you; being disciplined in your thinking and plans mean that you do not get carried away by grandiose plans, straying into ventures that have no relevance to your core businesses; that you are well organized and orderly in whatever you do.   It is very important to develop early your priorities, values and sense of proportion and spend your energy and resources to achieve your desired result. When you are disciplined, mentally, physically and financially, you will have the ability then to handle whatever comes your way. In other words, have focused concentration.   Eighth, be brave, be innovative, be creative and imaginative, be unafraid to take calculated risks and challenges; think the unthinkable, dream the impossible.  Sometimes, when you let your mind wander, unfettered by conventional thinking parameters, you might just find the right solution to your problems. But do not be foolhardy: your bravery must be tempered by practicalities, not recklessness that would jeopardize your business and your future.   Business is an adventure. It is not for the timid and the indecisive, those so afraid of failure that they dare not take the first step. Be brave and take a risk _ a ship in harbour is safe but it is not what a ship is for.  Business is an adventure that is both exciting and exhilarating and yet full of unseen dangers lurking at corners, but at the end of the day, it is an adventure worth undertaking and most fulfilling if accomplished well.    Whilst you must be realistic about your expectations, you must also think big. Not big cars, big houses but to think about your business. You have to start small but you must plan ahead not just for tomorrow or the next few years. You must think about how big your business is going to be 10 years, 20 years down the road. And to plan that far ahead, you must have a picture in your mind, a dream in your head about the future of your business.   As Robert Browning said, "Alas, but a man's dream must exceed his grasp or what's a heaven for?" Keep dreaming and turn your dreams into reality. That is the hallmark of success.  Aim to be the best and if you achieve it, you will be noticed and will be remembered. Set your ultimate goal but you must also plan your intermediate goals.  In order to reach the top, you move up step by step.    Ninth, be decisive. If you fear to go into business or are doubtful of success, you will, of course, get nowhere.  Indecision is a curse. The test of an entrepreneur is the ease with which a decision is made. It does not matter if it is a wrong decision.   A wrong decision is better than no decision. We have the brains to reason, to think. If you don't act you will never know the result.    Last but not at all the least, you must be interested in making money. Many think money is the root of all evils. It is greed and the love of money that is the root of all evils, when money is an end itself and not a means.  It also depends on what you use your money for. It could be used for good or for evil.  If you use your money to build mosques, give to the poor and needy, it cannot be evil. Don't blame money. Blame those who use money for evil purposes.   To succeed, you must show interest in money and in wanting to make money. There must be that hunger to make money. There must be that strong urge. After making money, to make more money. There is nothing immoral in this urge. If you don't have it, I think you should not go into business.  Business is all about making money. You must enjoy making money.  If you don't enjoy it, do something else. Please do not misunderstand me. I am not saying that you should only do something just for money. That alone cannot sustain you. But you are in the business to make money and that you must enjoy.   I would like, however, to distinguish between wanting to make money and greed. Do not be greedy. Greed destroys your self-respect. Do not worship money _ that you would lose your morals and religion for the sake of money. If earned through halal means, God will help you to succeed in whatever you do.   There is a joke about Imelda Marcos that she was in the 'mining' business. Every time she saw a business, she said, "It is mine, mine, mine," and look what happened to her.   When you have made money, be generous to those who have not, but only to deserving cases. Be thankful to God. Bersyukor.  Just because you have made lots of money, do not then think that you are superior to or better than the next person. The small courtesies in life are still important _ return phone calls, answer letters, show up on time, be polite, diplomatic, considerate.   Money in the bank is not a licence to be rude or arrogant. Neither does it mean that you have to flaunt your wealth. Conspicuous consumption only shows a weakness in character. If you have earned your money you will not need to bolster your image by surrounding yourself with excesses.  Learn to value your money but do not on the other hand, be someone who knows the price of everything and the value of none. Respect others and they will respect you. Your reputation is important.  Establish a clean reputation.  Make sure you are respected.  Maintain a high standard of integrity. At the end of the day, success isn't money, and it isn't power. The measure of your success isn't measured by the wealth you accumulated, the awards you received, the records you broke, the battles you won but the name you leave behind. There is no price to be placed on your name.    There is no point in being successful in business but a failure in life. Your family and your friends are important. A man with no friends and a dysfunctional family is not a happy man. It's not the money in your bank but people who make you happy. Do not confuse money with superiority. In the eyes of God, remember rich or poor, all are equal.   The above list are just some of the things that I think are important but ultimately all will depend on you.  Do you have the stuff to make it? Are you soft? Are you weak? Or are you the one with determination, courage and enough strength to see the company through difficult times? Each company will have its own problems.  Seldom will you find the answers in textbooks.   Yet, it is important to still read and learn how others solve their problems. All problems are unique to the particular organization, so you will have to use your head, use it wisely, sit down and analyse what has gone wrong. Then find out how best to solve your problem. Do not expect others to do your work for you.    Always remember to aim for excellence. Never settle for second best and second rate. Also remember that the road to success is never smooth. You may stumble along the way. Get up to move on.  You will grow stronger and steadier. Never accept defeat or failure.   Learn from your mistakes but do not repeat them. It would be a great misfortune if having tried and failed you gave up. The strong hearted with the determination and courage and preparedness to learn from past mistakes will in the end triumph.   Some of you may wonder why quite a number fail in spite of putting in so much effort. Is it because they are not lucky? My answer is that luck does play a part. It is sometimes an important element but don't depend on it.  In the end, it is 99% preparation and perspiration, and the rest is luck.   I do not presume that I have all the answers but what I have told you are some of the guidelines and qualities that you may need to succeed in business. There are so many different and some contradictory and some strange roads to riches.  There are so many paths leading to success. The best way to learn how to be a winner is to learn from winners and losers, especially the losers. Most losers lose because they take excessive risks and lack discipline.   In the final analysis, it is up to you to decide what is best. In the end, it is what is in you that determines your success. However, let me remind you that what I have been talking to you today is about how to run a business and be successful in business, NOT that to be successful you must be in business. In whatever endeavour you undertake, if you do your best, if you have pride in your work, if you work to achieve a standard of excellence in your field and if you retain the highest level of personal integrity, then you are a success.  To most people riches reflect success. This need not be so.  Success could be in other fields not confined to business only.  So go explore the Amazon, sing at the Opera, climb the Himalayas, find the cure for cancer, conduct an orchestra, discover a lost tribe in Kalimantan. Do what you want to do as long as it is the best.

      SEING IT MY WAY M. Bakri Musa  Obscenely Ostentatious Malay Weddings:  A Modern Potlatch Ritual     There is no limit to the obscenely ostentatious display of wealth amongst Malaysia’s newly rich. Consider weddings, in particular Malay weddings. They have become a modern version of the old potlatch rituals of the Northwest Indians of America, with each event becoming even more gaudy and lavish than previous ones.  The recent society wedding of Anwar Ibrahim’s daughter was only the latest. Like the earlier extravaganza for Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi’s daughter, the celebration involved the entire village and dragged on for days, with the bride and groom literally taking to heart their traditional role as Raja sa Hari (Royal Couple for the day). These gala Malay nuptials with guests that numbered in the thousands easily exceeded that of Prince Charles and Diana; at least they had only one reception. Now that Anwar and Badawi have set a new high-water mark for their princesses, I shudder to imagine what the next real royal Malay wedding will be like.  Anwar may be in jail and facing a mountain of legal and possible medical bills, but that did not stop him from putting on a lavish do. He had the money for that but not apparently for his daughter’s university education. She by her own admission is getting a “scholarship.”  Like the Indian potlatch ceremonies of yore, the orgy of expensive gifts proffered at these weddings is with every expectation that they will be reciprocated in some form or other in the future. It took an unsympathetic Federal Government to ban the wasteful practice among the Indians. With Malays there will be no such restraint, the change must therefore come from within. Sadly, I see no movement from that direction; thus do not expect an end to the ever-increasing showiness that is the Malay wedding.  The Malay masses may be forgiven for our confusion. On the one hand we are told ad nauseam by our leaders to be frugal, save for our children’s education, and generally be berdikari (self reliant), yet the powerful and rich among us continue with their vulgar displays of wealth. All these while they and their family are busy pigging at the public trough. Indeed for most, that is their only source of affluence.  Lest readers think that I am being unfairly hard on Malays, consider the equally flamboyant and garish affair put on by Samy Vellu only a few years earlier. This Bumiputra wannabe has learned only too well the wasteful ways of Malays.  Malaysian weddings have less to do with celebrating the commitment a young couple has made to spend the rest of their lives together, rather an occasion for their parents to display their social status and discharge their business and other obligations. Guests are not so much those who have shared in the lives of the bride and groom rather their parents’ business associates, superiors and notables. Typically the wedded couple barely knows the guests.  It is now trendy to invite diplomats, ministers and members of the royalty, all in an effort to display the host’s supposed social prominence. The whole occasion becomes overshadowed by the presence of these special guests, with the bride and groom reduced to being mere appendages.  The wedding day is special; to be cherished by the couple long after the guests have departed. For the bride especially, it is an occasion she has dreamed of all her life and spent countless hours and thousands of dollars to make it perfect. What she does not need on her own very special day is to be upstaged by some pompous dignitaries.  Malay weddings are also endlessly drawn out. There is not just one celebration, rather at least three or four. First is the betrothal. This used to be rather perfunctory but today it has become ever more lavish and elaborate. Typically the groom’s family would come bearing gifts of not just perfumes and jewelry but actual cold cash. The colorful ringgit notes of high denominations are prominently displayed in intricate floral and other designs, an attempt at some poor imitation of an ikebana arrangement.  The whole affair is reduced to a mercantile exchange, but instead of goats and buffaloes as the price for the bride, real money. Malays have apparently been swept by modernity, but not modern enough as yet to discover checks.  My own wedding – oh, so many decades ago – cost me a mere RM 49, the traditional dowry specified in our adat (custom). Alas the Malay wedding world has been swept in an inflationary cycle. Back then a ringgit was a real ringgit.  After the betrothal is the akad nikah, the actual exchange of wedding vows (an elaborate event by itself) followed by not just one but multiple bersanding ceremonies, first hosted by the bride’s family and then the groom’s. With many Malays now having multiple wives (the culture has effectively reduced marriageable women to trophies, with marriage akin to collecting cars or some other equally expensive and highly visible toys) it is not uncommon to have separate ceremonies, one given by the father and another by the mother. Imagine the exponential increase in the number of ceremonies!  With so many rites and celebrations, the frustrated young couple is left wondering when exactly the whole damn thing would be over and they could be left alone and start “doing it!”  Having recently put on a wedding (only one reception!) for my daughter, I know how expensive these affairs can be. I also know how much Malaysian ministers and civil servants earn (at least their honest income!), so it baffles me as to how they can put on such lavish affairs.              I find even more tasteless the present fad of aging middle-aged men putting on sumptuous weddings for their second (and often third and fourth!) bride. All in a desperate attempt at reliving their youthful fantasies! In America such libertine Don Juans would end up in jail, but with leaders unabashedly proclaiming Malaysia to be an Islamic state, the taking of multiple wives is not only permitted but also viewed as an expression of personal piety. Such perversity!  With nine sultans in Malaysia, and each permitted to have up to four current wives, there is no shortage of princes and princesses, and thus royal weddings. Combined this with the clamoring royal wannabes and social climbers, rest assured there will be no end to the extravaganza that is the Malay wedding.

      WoMan: When the COWS bites  Raja Zarith Idris  July 10:  What makes the other woman tick? ticks? Doesn’t she Don’t they have any conscience about destroying a happy family and shattering lives in her their ruthless pursuit of material comforts?   RAJA ZARITH IDRIS writes.  	 	    Advertisement    SERIOUS literature, gossip magazines and tabloids newspapers from around the world attest to the fact that Malaysian women aren't the only ones whose lives are ruined by the "Cunning Other Woman Syndrome" or COWS.SARS is under control, so are hepatitis A, B and C, but will COWS ever be completely eliminated? as a serious disease? This syndrome cuts across continents, age and social stratas: consider Monica Lewinsky, Camilla Parker-Bowles, Edwina Currie, Julia Roberts (wearing a T-shirt that said "A Loe Vera", apparently advertising the wonder plant, but which we know was actually an allusion to the name of her lover's wife), Vicky Morgan (Alfred Bloomingdale's mistress), and a cast of thousands.  There are books written on the subject: The Lives and Loves of a She-Devil by Fay Weldon, The Robber Bride by Margaret Atwood, Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman by Elizabeth Buchan, and The Other Woman by Eric Jerome Dickey, among others.Song lyrics abound with references to women losing the men they love to another: "All at once The smile that used to greet me Brightened someone else's day She took your smile away And left me with just memories..." (All At Once - Whitney Houston) I write this for every woman who knows what it feels like to be hurt, inside or out.  I write this for the wives who remain at home, struggling to look their best while keeping their homes clean, their children bathed and dinner on the table, while awaiting the arrival of their husbands, who are yet again delayed at the office because there is yet again by another urgent meeting. they have to attend.I remember one of the sweetest and gentlest of women I know telling me, with tears in her eyes, how painful the hurt was when she found out there was "someone else".  She said: "Do you know what time of the day I love the most? It's when my husband comes home returns from work, that's what I look forward to. That's the best time for me, when I see his face, when he walks in through the door. But then I found out that he had someone else - it felt as if my heart was cut by a knife." I write this for the wives who have the most beautiful jewellery and who, despite their wealth and success, have hearts which have been cut up, much in the same way that the diamonds around their necks and on their fingers had been cut.  The difference is that diamonds are hard and do not cry when being cut, but hearts are fragile and they can shatter into tiny little pieces that cannot be put back together again.  One successful CEO told me how she felt when she accidentally discovered what everyone else had known: that her husband had a lover.  She said: "I bled. To say that I cried is an understatement. My entire world had crashed, I couldn't function, I went bananas, bonkers, you name it. I couldn't do anything. I was paralysed."   What unique brain pattern goes on in the heads of these COWS-infected women that allows them to think that other women's husbands, fiances and boyfriends are actually free for the taking, and may the best woman win? Which part of their minds make them decide that it does not matter if another person - the wife, the fiancee, the girlfriend - is hurt? Three years ago, I wrote a piece similar to this, one, and I was branded cruel. Was I cruel? Well, let me count the ways: I did not set my sight deliberately on someone else's husband, fiance or boyfriend. I did not cause the breakdown of a couple's marriage. Neither did I make innocent children cry because they saw their parents quarrelling. I therefore categorically deny that I am a cruel woman.  To be fair, women suffering from COWS aren't all that unfeeling. It is just a wise decision on their part to care for men they have chosen as their own, without caring a hoot if the wives, fiancees, or girlfriends have got razor blades at their wrists because their entire world had fallen around them.COWS-infected women do have incredibly deep feelings and emotions. They are willing to uproot, themselves, give up the lives they lead (the cramped apartment, the boring job, public transport, eating fast food, little cash) and go instead into unchartered and dangerous territory (penthouse apartments, no job, a Mercedes-Benz, fine dining and lots of cash) because they sincerely want to devote themselves utterly and completely to the men they love.Is that so wrong? From the burgeoning numbers of those suffering from COWS, obviously not.  Men find women suffering from COWS irresistible: instead of reporting to the Health Ministry the dangers of such a disease that is now exceeding epidemic proportions, they instead choose to perpetuate the existence of these women.Men forget the wives who, once upon a time, in a kampung far, far away, had helped them dress up for that important job interview or who stayed up late into the night, correcting the grammatical mistakes their husbands made in their presentation for the board meeting because they (the wives) had a better command of English or could write better Malay.  Men cannot be blamed for being attracted to women suffering from COWS - their male bodies are full of rampaging testosterone, the hormone which enables them to see a pretty woman eating alone at McDonald's three roads away while they're having a family meal at another fast-food outlet.  I may have to consult a qualified GP here, but I am quite sure that testosterone is also the reason why men need to compete with their peers, and thus, if you read British Tatler magazine or the like, the phenomenon of the trophy wife, the trophy mistress or the trophy girlfriend is here to stay.Ladies and gentlemen, if we were to collect all the broken hearts that belong to the wronged wives, the betrayed fiancees and the girlfriends left behind, we could probably replace the glass panes of the KLCC Petronas Twin Towers with them, and still have extra left over.  This is what women suffering from COWS choose to overlook: wives, fiancees and girlfriends have hearts, just like them. Is that a surprise? The way I see it, to hurt the wives, fiancees and girlfriends is actually what gives these women that added zap and tingle, and make them all the more determined to prove the importance of their existence. - they do NOT want to be meek and mild.Perhaps, none of them planned to fall in love with their bosses, colleagues or rich-as-Croesus millionaires. But when it comes to being professionals, as opposed to being mere amateurs, at their jobs, COWS-infected women know that money is very important and will provide everything a girl could wish for, especially a girl's best friend: diamonds, Chanel, Prada, Bvlgari and, well, the whole floor of designer shops at KLCC.  It is a fine thing for a woman to devote herself to the man she loves regardless of the fact that whether he is a family man actually has a home with someone else, and there are children who love him sincerely and innocently, more than the COWS-infected woman does) but what is unforgivable is when the zero-ing onto a particular, unsuspecting man is done with military precision, and that it is done so for one reason and one reason only: money.  Imagine the scenario: Mother: "Darling daughter, while his wife is looking uglier by the day because she is miserable, make sure he gives you at least one house, a car and a good, hefty bank account." Overheard during a conversation between two men (I eavesdrop as part of my role as a journalist): "Well, you have to give it to her, she acts as if she is so in love with him so well, she should win an Oscar. And her mother should win the award for Best Supporting Actress."   So the question that remains to be answered is this: does a woman suffering from COWS lure her victim because she had fallen in love with his looks (a balding head, a generous belly) or was it the Ferrari he zooms in around town that made her decide "this is THE one for me" ? And there is that other question too: will this COWS epidemic end, if ever?   # The writer can be contacted at zsi2000hotmail.com

      This was an article written by Marina Mahathir in The Star's recent Musings column. Everything she says is so true, only she can get away with it! Enjoy...  The Star August 20, 2003   Not Always Boleh  by Marina Mahathir  AS we reach our 46th birthday and cries of "Malaysia Boleh" ring out, we should really reflect on this a bit. I am one of those who always find these constant shouts of "Malaysia Boleh" a bit tiresome. Not to be a spoilsport or anything, it's just that sometimes our focus on what we boleh (can) seems rather shallow. I have great admiration for Malaysians who can sail solo around the world, climb Everest, explore Antarctica and brave the English Channel. These are truly great feats and the glory achieved by them reflects on us, and motivates others to try and do similar things. What I have some problem with are the types of Malaysia Boleh feats that have to do with creating the longest popiah, the most number of teh tarik pulls, the most number of sticks of satay eaten, etc. No doubt everyone wants his or her 15 minutes Of fame, but after that, what? Will the person who ate the most number of durians ever be featured in Hari Ini dalam Sejarah?  As we all scramble to get into some book of records for things we boleh do, I wonder if we ever reflect on the things we tak boleh (cannot) do?  Here is a partial list, in no particular order:  We tak boleh talk about many things because they are deemed too sensitive for some unknown people's ears. Thus, there are so many things swept under the carpet now that we can hardly walk without tripping.  We tak boleh complain about how some people in authority behave. We tak boleh show affection to our loved ones in public because some people think it's obscene.  The women among us tak boleh feel safe in public because if something happens to us, it's always our fault.  We tak boleh be trusted to decide for ourselves whether a movie is good or bad.  We women tak boleh look at pictures of women's bodies in women's magazines; they have to be blacked out.  Young people tak boleh be given information about the many bad things that could happen to them even though this could save their lives. Universities tak boleh be left with more women students because this may lead to a very empowered population of women. And what's more they may start demanding that women be given vice-chancellor posts!  We tak boleh ask why the authorities have some ruling or other because then they may actually have to think of a good reason for them.  We tak boleh, tak boleh, tak boleh talk about religion even though sometimes the implementation of religious rulings can make our lives miserable.  We tak boleh complain when cars are triple parked on Fridays because,hey, what is a human law when they're breaking it to commune with God?  We tak boleh be sure anything we do will be judged on its own merits; we must get some VIP to help us.  We tak boleh excel in many things, including sports, because someone will tell us why we tak boleh do it (too difficult, not nice, not feminine, too much work, no money in it, etc).  We tak boleh point out the contradictions in our society because it's, well, embarrassing (like, how come we're so religious and so superstitious at the same time?).  We tak boleh teach our kids to think because then they may ask us too many questions.  We tak boleh act as if we would like to think about things too, and then give our opinion.  We tak boleh trust our young people even though one day, whether we like it or not, they will take over the country (unless we turn them into clones of us of course).  We tak boleh deny the fact that Siti Nurhaliza is a lot more influential than most politicians (who else can sell out a lipstick by just mentioning it?). But then Siti tak boleh make our lives miserable.  We tak boleh talk back, unless we couch it in polite terms. Never mind that the person we want to talk back to has been very rude.  Every day it seems we are encouraged to do things to prove we are the best, biggest, brightest. But rarely are we ever encouraged to be thinking and compassionate human beings with opinions of our own, especially if those opinions are different from the norm. Are we to show Malaysia Boleh only in harmless non-threatening ways even though these often have no long-term benefit? Or should we really be challenging ourselves in our minds and hearts?

      Oleh: PROFESOR DIRAJA UNGKU AZIZ http://mistique.i8.com/tragedi_pemikiran_melayu.htm  KALAU ditanya tentang minda orang Melayu kepada saya, saya rasa Melayu tidak sanggup berubah. Perspektif mereka terhad, tidak suka menyiasat dan mereka tidak mahu berfikir dengan mendalam.  Kalau kita tengok orang Melayu dalam cerita hikayat, Hikayat Raja-Raja Pasai misalnya, ia cukup menarik. Kita dapat menggambarkan bagaimana ekonominya dan strategi orang Melayu memerintah untuk berdepan dengan Majapahit.  Berdasarkan hikayat itu dan tradisi pantun Melayu,kita dapati orang Melayu ini mempunyai minda yang canggih. Tetapi yang jadi tragedi ialah orang Melayu tidak nampak ini semua kerana tiga pengaruh besar.  Pertama, dalam tahun 1920-an dan 1930-an, pihak penjajah British menolak apa yang datang daripada Melayu, termasuk pantun, sebagai folk art, menjadikan apa yang dihasilkan oleh Melayu sebagai second class.  Ketika itu, Melayu yang berharap untuk naik pangkat dan dapat kerja dengan kerajaan penjajah terpaksa ikut teori penjajah Inggeris. Ini semua membawa orang Melayu kepada perspektif jati diri yang salah.  Itu pengaruh penjajah.  Pada zaman ini, saya melihat sungguhpun banyak pemimpin Melayu bercakap tentang sains dan teknologi, orang Melayu pada umumnya tidak dapat menangkap pandangan itu.  Di Eropah, sejak zaman renaissance, mereka telah mempelajari kemajuan sains dengan pendekatan yang berbeza dengan Islam. Mereka sentiasa bertanya.  Malangnya, di Malaysia, dari bangku sekolah kita tidak galakkan budak-budak bertanya. Sampailah mereka di universiti, kita tidak galakkan mereka bertanya: Kenapa?   Di negara kita, pelajar tidak berani bertanya dan guru-guru pula tidak tahu menjawab. Budaya ini menunjukkan tidak wujudnya inquiry mind dalam masyarakat Melayu. Kita tidak ada sikap saintifik.  Sikap negatif inilah yang menyebabkan berleluasanya cerita orang kena tipu dengan bomoh. Yang saya hairan, graduan-graduan universiti pun kena tipu dengan bomoh.  Kalau pada kurun ke-18, terutama di England, orang selalu bertanya: Kalau betul ada hantu, mana hantu?   Kita hendak pergi ke tempat hantu, kita nak pergi tengok hantu untuk lihat apa manifestasi hantu.   Pendekatan berani bertanya ini adalah sikap masyarakat dan tamadun yang berasaskan sains. Malangnya, kita tidak sedia dan berani bertanya, yang akhirnya menyebabkan kita tidak berani menghadapi cabaran.  Pemikiran Melayu ini sebahagiannya adalah sisa-sisa pengaruh penjajahan British. Ini bukan rahsia lagi.   Kita boleh membaca dokumen-dokumen itu di London.   Menurut para pegawai Inggeris, orang Melayu ini kalau diberi terlalu banyak pendidikan dan kalau diajar ilmu sains, kelak mereka akan jadi seperti orang India di India. Mereka akan berdemonstrasi dan hendakkan kebebasan.  Akibat dasar itu, tidak ada trouble makers. Trouble makers Melayu hanya timbul selepas Perang Dunia Kedua setelah kemasukan Jepun.  Telah ada banyak buku yang membincangkan tentang subjek bagaimana British berjaya mengamalkan dasar yang mengongkong minda Melayu.  Itu semasa penjajahan. Selepas kita merdeka, minda orang Melayu masih terkongkong kerana semua orang Melayu kemudiannya gila hendak kuasa dan hendak jadi kaya.  Ini adalah teori saya mengapa minda Melayu tidak berubah. Saya bertanggungjawab tentang pandangan ini.  Selepas merdeka, sesetengah orang Melayu yang ada kuasa, dia rasa dia boleh memerintah Malaysia sama bagus macam penjajah British.  Minda Melayu ini sentiasa ada sesuatu yang membendung dan mempengaruhi - daripada kesan-kesan kolonialisasi pada tahun-tahun 1930-an, pengaruh Indonesia yang tidak sesuai di sini pada tahun 1940-an dan 1950-an, kesan media massa, dan kemudiannya budaya wang dalam masyarakat Melayu pada dekad-dekad terakhir ini.  Sekarang ini semua orang Melayu hendak kaya.   Sebagai seorang pendidik universiti, saya percaya (tetapi saya tidak ada buktinya) kalau orang mendapat pendidikan, mereka akan lebih bebas dan berubah.  Contohnya pada akhir tahun 1970-an. Ketika Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad menjadi Menteri Perdagangan Antarabangsa dan Industri, Malaysia ketika itu dapat menarik banyak modal asing untuk membuka kilang mikrocip.  Kita dapat mewujudkan peluang pekerjaan kepada beratus-ratus ribu orang terutamanya untuk wanita.   Wanita Melayu yang bekerja kilang ketika itu akhbar-akhbar gelar mereka ini sebagai minah karan. Orang Melayu hina wanita Melayu yang bekerja kilang.  Kenapa budak-budak perempuan Melayu ini mahu tinggalkan rumah di Kelantan,  tinggalkan kampung di Johor untuk pergi bekerja kilang di Pulau Pinang, Selangor dan Melaka?  Mereka sanggup kerana mereka telah belajar sampai ke peringkat sekolah menengah. Jadi program kerajaan membuka sekolah-sekolah menengah pada tahun 1960-an dan 1970-an, walaupun tidak ada rancangan khusus, ia telah membebaskan pemikiran budak-budak perempuan Melayu.  Waktu itu terdapat beribu-ribu remaja wanita Melayu pergi bekerja di kilang-kilang. Dalam penyelidikan saya pada tahun 1970-an, dalam soal selidik saya bertanya mereka, bila hendak kahwin?   Di kampung, dulunya mereka ini berumah tangga pada usia muda. Umur 18 dan 19 tahun sudah kahwin atau dikahwinkan, tetapi akhirnya bercerai juga.  Oleh kerana pendidikan dan faktor pendedahan kepada karier baru, wanita Melayu itu sudah ada idea tidak mahu kahwin cepat-cepat. Mereka hendak bekerja terlebih dahulu dan menyimpan duit.  Kita tanya lagi, kalau sudah kahwin hendak anak cepat atau lambat? Mereka kata lambat. Mereka hendak tangguh dapat anak sebab mereka hendak enjoy hidup berkahwin dan mewujudkan rumah tangga yang lengkap terlebih dahulu. Kata mereka, kalau dapat anak susahlah.  Dalam sekelip mata, wanita Melayu berubah sikap. Ini semua tidak diprogramkan oleh kerajaan. Ia jadi begitu sahaja.  Tetapi masyarakat Melayu tidak faham keuntungan perubahan minda wanita ini terutama di kalangan kumpulan berfikiran konservatif.  Hari ini di Malaysia, trend semasa ialah wanita menguasai 65 peratus tempat belajar di universiti-universiti. Dalam sektor kerajaan, banyak wanita yang memegang jawatan tinggi.   Trend ini pasti mengubah masyarakat Melayu secara pesat, sebagaimana ia mengubah pemikiran wanita Melayu pada tahun 1970-an.  Ini semua adalah hasil daripada perubahan sikap yang tidak dirancang tapi terjadi.  Perubahan minda itu berlaku secara tidak sengaja.  Kadang-kadang kalau nasib kita baik, hasil perubahan yang tidak dirancang itu juga progresif seperti dalam kes perubahan minda wanita Melayu.  Bagaimanapun, kadang-kadang perubahan yang dirancang tidak terjadi kerana orang yang hendak melaksanakannya pun tidak jujur selain terdapat pengaruh lain yang menghalang seperti pengaruh politik tempatan, politik antarabangsa, Indonesia, peranan orang agama yang menimbulkan nilai-nilai sama ada seseorang dapat pergi syurga atau tidak.  Minda Melayu tidak dapat memikul ini semua. Kerana ada sesuatu dalam budaya mereka yang masih tidak diubah, mereka sanggup duduk di kedai kopi main dam. Contohnya orang lelaki di Kelantan dan Terengganu. Kalau mereka tidak main dam, mereka akan bincang untuk gasak kerajaan. Semua salah, dia sahaja yang betul.  Titik perubahan kepada minda Melayu ialah tragedi 13 Mei 1969, tetapi peristiwa tersebut dan dasar-dasar ekonomi, pendidikan dan politik selepas itu tidak sepenuhnya menukar sikap orang Melayu.  Ada beberapa faktor lain yang menghalang iaitu pengaruh Barat, peranan media massa, politik serta agama.  Kita memang berubah sedikit dari segi lahiriah tetapi saya tidak fikir orang Melayu kini berada pada kedudukan yang lebih baik.  Kita sudah terjangkit apa yang bekas Perdana Menteri British, Margaret Thatcher hendak dulu, dan fahaman ini cukup besar sama ada di kalangan pemimpin Melayu dalam UMNO mahupun Pas, dan juga di kalangan para pegawai kerajaan.  Kita hendak menjadi apa yang Thatcher kata a nation of shopkeepers. Kita tidak mahu kata shopkeepers, kita gunakan istilah usahawan.  Orang berfikir kalau sebahagian besar orang Melayu jadi usahawan, maka ekonomi orang Melayu akan naik. Ini saya rasa salah. Pendekatan untuk membangunkan orang Melayu dengan wang ringgit dan kebendaan ini tidak betul. Tesisnya silap.  Tetapi itulah minda Melayu sekarang.  Akhirnya saya lihat orang Melayu kini sudah kurang komitmen terhadap bangsanya sendiri. Sudah tidak ada kesedaran bahawa aku orang Melayu, aku mesti berkhidmat kepada orang Melayu, untuk membangunkan orang Melayu.  * PROFESOR Diraja Ungku Aziz adalah bekas Naib Canselor Universiti Malaya.

      For those who love to judge partially & with bias.   Read On....   Hopefully we will remember to tell this story to our children one of these days..  There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his sons to learn to not judge things too quickly. So he sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go and look at a pear tree that was a great distance away. The first son went in the winter, the second in the spring, the third in summer, and the youngest son in the fall.   When they had all gone and come back, he called them together to describe what they had seen. The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and twisted. The second son said no--it was covered with green buds and full of promise. The third son disagreed, he said it was laden with blossoms that smelled so sweet and looked so beautiful, it was the most graceful thing he had ever seen. The last son disagreed with all of them; he said it was ripe and drooping with fruit, full of life and fulfillment.  The man then explained to his sons that they were all right, because they had each seen but one season in the tree's life. He told them that you cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one season, and that the essence of who they are--and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life--can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.  If you give up when it's winter, you will miss the promise of your spring, the beauty of your summer, fulfillment of your fall. Don't let the pain of one season destroy the joy of all the rest.

Til the world tramples me, and I am no more, I will stand tall as tall as I might. Always reaching for the sun. Even though all around is brokenness and pain I'll lend my brief beauty and stand tall as tall as I might."  By Amanda Kiser

      You can be just thirty-three and over the hill, Or eighty-five going on twenty-nine! The young-at-heart don't care about years; They know age is only a state of mind!  You're never too old to be young, So make love and laughter part of the plan; The best thing in life is to die young As old as you possibly can!

      Do you realize that the only time in our lives when we like to get old is when we're kids? If you're less than 10 years old, you're so excited about aging that you think in fractions." How old are you?" "I'm four and a half!" You're never thirty-six and a half. You're four and a half, going on five!   That's the key.   You get into your teens, now they can't hold you back. You jump to the next number, or even a few ahead.   "How old are you?" "I'm gonna be 16!" You could be 13, but hey, you're gonna be 16!   And then the greatest day of your life . . you become 21.  Even the words sound like a ceremony . . . YOU BECOME 21.  YESSSS!!!   But then you turn 30. Oooohh, what happened there? Makes you sound like bad milk. He TURNED; we had to throw him out. There's no fun now, you're just a sour-dumpling. What's wrong? What's changed?   You BECOME 21, you TURN 30, then you're PUSHING 40.   Whoa! Put on the brakes, it's all slipping away. Before you know it, you REACH 50 . . . and your dreams are gone.   But wait!!! You MAKE it to 60. You didn't think you would!  So you BECOME 21, TURN 30, PUSH 40, REACH 50 and MAKE it to 60.  You've built up so much speed that you HIT 70! After that it's a day-by-day thing; you HIT Wednesday!   You get into your 80s and every day is a complete cycle; you HIT lunch; you TURN 4:30; you REACH bedtime.   And it doesn't end there. Into the 90s, you start going backwards; "I was JUST 92."   Then a strange thing happens. If you make it over 100, you become a little kid again. "I'm 100 and a half!"   May you all make it to a healthy 100 and a half!!    HOW TO STAY YOUNG  1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctor worry about them. That is why you pay him/her.  2. Keep only cheerful friends. The GROUCHES pull you down.  3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever. Never let the brain idle. " An idle mind is the devil's workshop." And the devil's name is Alzheimer's.  4. Enjoy the simple things in life.  5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath.  6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be ALIVE while you are alive.  7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it's family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.  8. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help.  9. Don't take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, to the next county, to a foreign country, but NOT to where the guilt is.  10. Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity.   AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.

      Thanks to Doc Tee Jay, from his blog: http://docteejay.blogspot.com/   Here is a letter from Ronald Reagan to his son, Michael, who was 26 years old when he married his first wife, Julie, who was 18 in 1971. I hope you won't stop reading here.  Dear Mike: You've heard all the jokes that have been rousted around by all the 'unhappy marrieds' and cynics. Now, in case no one has suggested it, there is another viewpoint. You have entered into the most meaningful relationship there is in all human life. It can be whatever you decide to make it.  Some men feel their masculinity can only be proven if they play out in their own life all the locker-room stories, smugly confident that what a wife doesn't know won't hurt her. The truth is, somehow, way down inside, without her ever finding lipstick on the collar or catching a man in the flimsy excuse of where he was till 3 a.m, a wife does know, and with that knowing, some of the magic of this relationship disappears.  There are more men griping about marriage who kicked the whole thing away themselves than there can ever be wives deserving the blame. There is an old law of physics that you can only get out of a thing as much as you put in it. The man who puts into the marriage only half of what he owns will get that out. Sure, there will be moments when you will see someone or think back on an earlier time and you will be challenged to see if you can still make the grade, but let me tell you how really great is the challenge of proving your masculinity and charm with one woman for the rest of your life. Any man can find a twerp here and there who will go along with cheating, and it doesn't take all that much manhood.  It does take quite a man to remain attractive and to be loved by a woman who has heard him snore, seen him unshaven, tended him while he was sick and washed his dirty underwear. Do that and keep her still feeling a warm glow and you will know some very beautiful music. If you truly love a girl, you shouldn't ever want her to feel, when she sees you greet a secretary or a girl you both know, that humiliation of wondering if she was someone who caused you to be late coming home, nor should you want any other woman to be able to meet your wife and know she was smiling behind her eyes as she looked at her, the woman you love, remembering this was the woman you rejected even momentarily for her favours.  Mike, you know better than many what an unhappy home is and what it can do to others. Now you have a chance to make it come out the way it should. There is no greater happiness for a man than approaching a door at the end of a day knowing someone on the other side of that door is waiting to the sound of his footsteps.  Love,  Dad  p.s. You'll never get in trouble if you say "I love you" at least once a day

      God grant us this year a wider view, So we see others' faults through the eyes of You. Teach us to judge not with hasty tongue, Neither the adult ... nor the young.  Give us patience and grace to endure And a stronger faith so we feel secure. Instead of remembering, help us forget The irritations that caused us to fret.  Freely forgiving for some offense And finding each day a rich recompense. In offering a friendly, helping hand And trying in all ways to understand;  That all of us whoever we are ... Are trying to reach an unreachable star. For the great and small ... the good and bad, The young and old ... the sad and glad  Are asking today; Is life worth living? The answer is only in, loving and giving. For only Love can make man kind And Kindness of Heart brings Peace of Mind.  By giving love, we can start this year To lift the clouds of hate and fear.

      I am neither two much nor too little. I do not have to prove to anyone or anything who I am. I have been many identities, each one a perfect expression for that particular lifetime. I am content to be who and what I am this time. I do not yearn to be like someone else, for that is not the experience I chose this time. Next time I will be different. I am perfect as I am, right now. I am sufficient. I am one with all of life. There is no need to struggle to be better. All I need to do is love myself more today than yesterday, and to treat myself as someone who is deeply loved. With joy, I recognize my perfection and the perfection of life.

      By David Bolchover   When Sir Alex Ferguson leads his soccer team into the FA Cup Final in Cardiff on Saturday, it will mark the end of a challenging season both on and off the pitch for the manager of Manchester United. The tensions between Sir Alex and John Magnier, the Irish racing tycoon and one of the club's big shareholders, have highlighted Sir Alex's biggest challenge. He may be king inside his own little fiefdom - the cosy, artificial world of soccer - but this time round he is not up against young lads whom he can order around as he likes. In his confrontation with Mr Magnier, he is face to face with an experienced player in the tough world of business. In this respect, Sir Alex has stepped into the really big league.  Nevertheless, top soccer managers and players deserve better regard from the outside world than they often receive. Whatever the rights and wrongs of his quarrel with Mr Magnier, Sir Alex has been top of the tree in a hugely competitive and open meritocracy in which success shows and failure is cruelly exposed. If only business were more like the perfect market that is soccer. If only talent, determination and performance meant everything and flattery, nepotism and image counted for nothing.  The experiences of Jason and Darren Ferguson, two of Sir Alex's sons, starkly illustrate the gulf between soccer and business. Jason's career as a soccer agent has undoubtedly been helped by the fact that his father is such a big figure in the industry. The very name of Ferguson carries weight and credibility in British sport - and brings with it good connections. That is business.  Now wind the clock back to the Manchester United career of Darren Ferguson, who left the club just over a decade ago. He was a decent player, but having his father as manager could not disguise the fact that he was not good enough for a team with designs on European domination. He is now playing for Wrexham, a lower division team. That is soccer. A good name and a connection are not enough.  No industry is more meritocratic and yet the consensus seems to be that top soccer players are overpaid. For the best players, though, $140,000 a week is not so ridiculous. First, they provide entertainment for millions. Second, they have an extremely rare talent that is visible and measurable which the market is willing to pay for. In banking and broking , plenty of traders earn vast salaries. Now that is ridiculous. You could train any one of thousands of reasonably bright 18-year-olds with the gift of the gab and a capacity for hard work to do their job. But how many youngsters are potentially as good as Thierry Henry at soccer?  Sir Alex - and for that matter any other great soccer manager - devote their lives to getting the best out of others and are hugely and obviously successful at it. If only business had more managers like these men it would contribute greatly to a country's overall productivity. According to a recent Gallup survey, more than 80 per cent of British workers lack commitment to their jobs and most blame poor management for their low level of motivation.  If you want inspirational leaders, do not look to chief executives. They are mostly just company men who played a canny political game and got a few breaks. Go to the dugout at the top soccer clubs instead. If you want to feel jealous about people who are lucky enough to earn a huge salary, go to Hollywood or Wall Street. Top soccer players do not need the right school, influential fathers, well-connected publicity agents or the luck of being in the right place at the right time. They got their slice of fortune on the day they were born. It is called sublime talent.  The writer, co-author of 'The 90-Minute Manager: Lessons from the Sharp End of Management', is a consultant on management and leadership

      There were these 4 guys, a Russian, a German, an American and a French, who found this small genie bottle.  When they rubbed the bottle, a genie appeared. Thankful that the 4 guys had released him out of the bottle, He said, "Next to you all are 4 swimming pools, I will give each of you a wish. When you run towards the pool and jump, you shout what you want the pool of water to become, then your wish will come true."  The French wanted to start. He ran towards the pool, jumped and shouted"WINE". The pool immediately changed into a pool of wine. The Frenchman was so happy swimming and drinking from the pool.  Next is the Russian's turn, he did the same and shouted, "VODKA" and immersed himself into a pool of vodka.  The German was next and he jumped and shouted, "BEER". He was so contented with his beer pool.  The last is the American. He was running towards the pool when suddenly he steps on a banana peel. He slipped towards the pool and shouted, SHIT!!!..."  Lesson: Think twice before you say something, because sometimes accidents do happen.

      For all of us who feel only the deepest love and affection for the way computers have enhanced our lives, read on. At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated, "If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon".  In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:  1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.  2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a new car.  3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue.  For some reason you would simply accept this.  4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.  5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but would run on only five percent of the roads.  6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single "This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation" warning light.  7. The airbag system would ask, "Are you sure?" before deploying.  8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.   9. Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn  how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.   10.You'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the engine off.

      A young man joined the Army and signed up with the aratroopers. He went though the standard training, completed the practice jumps from higher and higher structures, and finally went to take his first jump from an airplane. The next day, he called home to his father to tell him the news.  "So, did you jump?" the father asked.  "Well, let me tell you what happened. We got up in the plane, and the sergeant opened up the door and asked for volunteers. About a dozen men got up and just walked out of the plane!"  "Is that when you jumped?" asked the father.  "Um, not yet. Then the sergeant started to grab the other men one at a time and throw them out the door."  "Did you jump then?" asked the father.  "I'm getting to that. Every one else had jumped, and I was the last man left on the plane. I told the sergeant that I was too scared to jump. He told be to get off the plane or he'd kick my butt."  "So, did you jump?"  "Not then. He tried to push me out of the plane, but I grabbed onto the door and refused to go. Finally he called over the Jump Master. The Jump Master is this great big guy, about six-foot five, and 250 pounds. He said to me, `Boy, are you gonna jump or not?' I said, `No, sir. I'm too scared.' So the Jump Master pulled down his zipper and took his penis out. I swear, it was about ten inches long and as big around as a baseball bat! He said, `Boy, either you jump out that door, or I'm sticking this little baby up your ass.'"  "So, did you jump?" asked the father.  "Well, a little, at first."

      Lee Kuan Yew was awoken at 4am by the telephone.  "Sir, it's the Minister of Health here. Sorry to bother you at this hour but there is an emergency! I've just received word that the Durex factory in Bukit Timah has been burnt to the ground. It is estimated that the entire Singapore supply of condoms will be gone by the end of the week."  "What a disaster! The economy will never be able to cope with all those unwanted babies - we'll be ruined! We're going to have to ship some condoms in from abroad..."  "Indonesia?"  "No chance!! The tabloids will have a field day on this one!"  "What about Malaysia?"  "Maybe - but we don't want them to know that we are stuck. Call their Prime Minister - tell him we need one million condoms; coloured white and red; ten inches long and eight inches thick! That way they'll know how big we really are!"  The poor chap called Dr. M, who agreed to help the kiasus out in their hour of need. Three days later a flight arrived in Changi airport - full of boxes.  The delighted Lee Kuan Yew rushed out to open the boxes. He found condoms; 10 inches long; 8 inches thick, all coloured white and red. He then noticed in small writing on each and every one:  MADE IN MALAYSIA SIZE: SMALL

      Contributed by Yong Soo Heong  Number One Idiot of 2003  I am a medical student currently doing a rotation in toxicology at the poison control centre.  Today, this woman called in very upset because she caught her little daughter eating ants. I quickly reassured her that the ants are not harmful and there would be no need to bring her daughter to the hospital.  She calmed down and at the end of the conversation happened to mention that she gave her daughter some ant poison to eat in order to kill the ants.  I told her that she had better bring her daughter to the emergency room right away. Here's your award, lady. Wear it with pride.    Number Two Idiot of 2003  Early this year, some Boeing employees on the airfield decided to steal a life raft from one of the 747s. They were successful in getting it out of the plane and home. Shortly after they took it for a float on the river, they noticed a Coast Guard helicopter coming towards them. It turned out that the chopper was homing in on the emergency locator beacon that was activated when the raft was inflated. They are no longer employed at Boeing. Here's your award, guys.   Number Three Idiot of 2003  A true story out of San Francisco: A man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of America, walked into the branch and wrote "this iz a stikkup. Put all your muny in this bag." While standing in line, waiting to give his note to the teller, he began to worry that someone had seen him write the note and might call the police before he reached the teller's window. So he left the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo. After waiting a few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller. She read it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he wasn't the brightest light in the street told him that she could not accept his stickup note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of America. Looking somewhat defeated, the man said, "OK" and left. He was arrested a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of America.  (Don't bother with this guy's award. He probably couldn't read it anyway).    Number four Idiot of 2003  A motorist was unknowingly caught in an automated speed trap that measured his speed using radar and photographed his car. He later received in the mail a ticket for $40 and a photo of his car. Instead of payment, he sent the police department a photograph of $40.  Several days later, he received a letter from the police that contained another picture, this time of handcuffs. He immediately mailed in his $40.  Another award (though this guy might be onto something worth thinking about)!   Number Five Idiot of 2003  A guy walked into a little corner store with a shotgun and demanded all of the cash from the cash drawer. After the cashier put the cash in a bag, the robber saw a bottle of Scotch that he wanted behind the counter on the shelf. He told the cashier to put it in the bag as well, but the cashier refused and said, "Because I don't believe you are over 21.  The robber said he was, but the clerk still refused to give it to him because he didn't believe him. At this point, the robber took his driver's license out of his wallet and gave it to the clerk. The clerk looked it over and agreed that the man was in fact over 21 and he put the Scotch in the bag.  The robber then ran from the store with his loot. The cashier promptly called the police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got off the license. They arrested the robber two hours later. This guy definitely needs a award!    Idiot Number Six of 2003  A pair of Michigan robbers entered a record shop nervously waving revolvers. The first one shouted, "Nobody moves!" When his partner moved, the startled first bandit shot him. This guy doesn't need a award, he probably figured it out himself.    Idiot Number Seven of 2003  Arkansas: Seems this guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that he'd just throw a brick through a liquor store window, grab some booze, and run.  So he lifted the brick and heaved it over his head at the window. The brick bounced back and hit the wouldbe thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. It seems the liquor store window was made of FlexiGlass.  The whole event was caught on videotape.  (Oh, that's smart. Give him his award)

      A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture  when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced out of  a dust cloud towards him.  The driver, a young man in a Broni suit, Gucci shoes, Maui Jim sunglasses and Zegna tie, leans out the window and asks the shepherd, "If I tell  you exactly how many sheep you have in your  flock, will you give me one?"  The shepherd  looks at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing flock and calmly answers, "Sure. Why not?"  The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell  notebook computer, connects it to his  AT&T cell phone, surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite navigation system to get  an exact fix on his location which he then  feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.  The  young man then  opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop  and exports it to an image processing  facility in Hamburg, Germany. Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored.  He then accesses a MS-SQL database through an ODBC  connected Excel spreadsheet with hundreds of  complex formulas. He uploads all of this data via an email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response.  Finally, he prints out full-color,  150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized  HP LaserJet printer and finally turns to the shepherd and says, "You have exactly 1586 sheep."  "That's right.  Well, I guess you can take one of my sheep,"  says the shepherd. He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on amused as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car. Then the shepherd  says to the young man, "Hey, if I can tell  you exactly what your business is, will you  give him back to me?"  The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, "Okay, why not?"  "You're a consultant,"  says the shepherd. "Wow! That's correct,"  says the yuppie, "but how did you guess  that?"  "No guessing required," answered the shepherd. "You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew; to a  question I never asked; and you don't know  crap about my business...... Now give me back my dog!"

      A body builder picks up a blonde at a bar and takes her home with him.  He takes off his shirt and the woman says,  "What a great chest you have." The body builder tells her, "That's 100 lb. of dynamite."  He takes off his pants and the woman says, "What massive calves you have." The body builder tells her, "That's 100 lb. of  dynamite,"  He then removes his underwear and the woman goes running and screaming out of the apartment. The body builder puts his clothes back on and chases after her.  He catches up to her and asks why she ran out of the apartment.  The woman replies, "I was afraid to be around all that dynamite after I saw how short the fuse was."

      Once, there was a man who was upset by his past deeds that he decided to visit a church and confess all of his sins. When he arrived at the church, he walked to the confession area and spoke to the pastor.  "Father, I am sinful."  "Yes son, just tell me what have you done, the Lord will forgive you."  "Father, I have a steady relationship with my girlfriend. It's been 3 years and nothing serious ever happened between us. Yesterday, I visited her house and nobody was at home except for her sister. We were alone and I had sex with her."  "That's bad, my boy. Fortunately you realise your mistake."  "Father, last week I went to her office to look for her, but nobody was around except for one of her colleagues, so I had sex with her too."  "That's not very good of you."  "Father, last month, I went to her uncle's house to look for her. Nobody was around except for her auntie, and I had sex with her too."  "Father? ......... Father?" suddenly this guy realised that there was no response from the Father. He walked over and discovered that the Pastor was not there. So he began searching for him.  "Father? Where are you?"  He searched high and low, and finally he found him hiding under the table behind the piano.  "Father, why are you hiding here?"  "Sorry son, suddenly I remembered there is nobody around here except me."

      Ms Brooks was having trouble with one of her first-grade pupils.  "Johnny, what is your problem?"  Johnny answered, "I'm too smart for the first Grade. My sister is in third grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the third-grade too!"  Ms Brooks had had enough, so she took Johnny to the principal's office. The principal agreed that he would give the boy a test and if he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the first-grade and behave.  He started by asking Johhny some simple arithmetic. "What is three times three?"  "Nine, Sir."  "How much is nine times six?"  "Fifty-four."  And so it went with every question the principal thought a third-grade should know.  The principal looked at Ms Brooks and said, "I think Johnny can go to third grade! He seems smart enough."  Ms Brooks said to the principal, "Let me ask him some questions?" The principal and Johnny both agreed.  Ms Brooks asked, "What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?  Johnny, after a moment, answered "Legs, Ma'am"  "What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?"  "Pockets!"  "OK, what does a dog do that a man steps into?"  "Pants."  "What starts with a C and ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin whitish liquid?"  "Coconut."  "What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?"  The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Johnny was taking charge. "Bubblegum!"  "What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?"  "Shake hands, Ma'am."  "Now for some "Who am I" sort of questions, OK? First one. You stick your poles inside me, you tie me down to get me up, and I get wet before you do."  Johnny, quick as ever, answered, "Tent!"  "OK, a finger goes in me. You fiddle with me when you're bored. The best man always has me first."  The Principal was looking restless and a bit tense. But Johnny was on the ball with "Wedding Ring!"  "I come in many sizes. When I'm not well, I drip. When you blow me, you feel good."  "Nose."  "Right, I have a stiff shaft, my tip penetrates, and I come with a quiver."  "Arrow."  "Good, now for the last one. What word starts with an 'F', ends in K', and means a lot of heat and excitement?"  Firetruck, Ma'am!"  The principal breathed a sigh of relief and said to the teacher, "Send him to university, I got the last ten questions wrong myself!"

      Bob Smith, my assistant programmer, can always be found hard at work at his desk. He works independently, without wasting company time talking to colleagues. Bob never thinks twice about assisting fellow employees, and always finishes given assignments on time. Often he takes extended measures to complete his work, sometimes skipping coffee breaks. Bob is a dedicated individual who has absolutely no vanity in spite of his high accomplishments and profound knowledge in his field. I firmly believe that Bob can be classed as an asset employee, the type which cannot be dispensed with. Consequently, I recommend that Bob be promoted to executive management, and a proposal will be executed as soon as possible.  Addendum: That idiot was standing over my shoulder while I wrote the report sent to you earlier today. Kindly re-read only the odd numbered lines.

      (This really happened)  Caller: Is this Tech Support?  Tech:   Yes it is. How may I help you?  Caller: Well, it's a software problem. Somthing with the power.  Tech:   The power supply?  Caller: Yes. Thats it.  Tech:   The power supply is hardware sir, not software.  Caller: No, this is a software problem.  Tech:   Ok, what exactly is the problem?  Caller: Black smoke keeps coming from the vents when I turn it on.  Tech:   You need a new power supply. What you need to do is take it...  Caller: No! It's a software problem!  (The tech guy realising at this point that the guy is totally clueless about computers, and won't let up that it is a software problem, he decided to just lead him on)  Tech:   Oh. I guess you are right. It MUST be a software problem.  Caller: That's what I've been trying to tell you! So how do I fix it?  Tech:   Do you have your Windows 95 Startup Disk still?  Caller: Hold on, let me find it. (Pause) Yes, I have it.  Tech:   Ok, on that disk is a program called "Microsoft Anti-smoke". Put          the disk in, turn on the machine, and it will be fixed.  Caller: Ok, hold on (Pause) No, it didn't work.  Tech:   You must need a higher version of Anti-Smoke. Call Microsoft.  Caller: Ok, thanks.  (So the man calls Microsoft)  Microsoft: Microsoft Tech Support, How may I help you?  Caller:    I called this other tech guy and told him that there was smoke            coming out of power supply. At first he said I needed to            replace it, but I wouldn't let him rip me off like that. So he            said you guys had the program called "Anti-Smoke" on the disk I            got with my computer. We tryed it, but I need A higher version.  Microsoft: Sir I don't...  (And then the Microsoft guy got what the other support guy was doing. So he went with it too.)  Microsoft: Ok sir, that won't be a problem. I need the numbers of the back            of your computer so I know what version to send you.  Caller:    Ok. (Pause) Z4....  Microsoft: I'm sorry, did you say "Z" was the first letter of the code?  Caller:    Yes....  Microsoft: I'm afraid we have no version of "Anti-Smoke" that will work            with "Z Class" computers.  Caller:    Then what do I do?  Microsoft: You will have to replace your power supply.  Caller:    Ok, thanks.  Microsoft: Sure. Goodbye. (Click)

      From a strictly mathematical viewpoint, it goes like this:  What Makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about achieving 103%? Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answers these questions:  What does it take to achieve 100% in life? Let's do the math...  If:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  is represented as:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26  Then:  H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K  8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%  and  K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E  11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%  But,  A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E  1+20+20+9+20+21+4 5 = 100%  And,  B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T  21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%  BUT, look how far ass kissing will take you.  A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G  1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%  So, one can then conclude, with mathematical certainty, that while Hard work and Knowledge will get you close, it takes the Attitude to get you there; but if your boss wants more... Bullshit and Ass Kissing will put you over the top!

      In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot.  And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she had been called 'Amazon Dot Com.'  And she said unto Abraham, her husband, "Why doth thou travel far from town to town with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?"  And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, "How, dear?"  And Dot replied, "I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)."  Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever moving from his tent.  But this success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secrete himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short.  And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would work only with Brother Gates' drumheads and drumsticks.  And Dot did say, "Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."  And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known "eBay" he said, "We need a name that reflects what we are."  And Dot replied, "Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators."  "YAHOO," said Abraham.  And that is how it all began. It wasn't Al Gore after all.

      AAI (Appearance Arousal Index) – A ten-point subjective scale used by human males to rate the superficial physical appearance of a female. 50% of the overall rating is weighted toward facial attractiveness. “10” is the highest possible rating. A female assigned a score of “1” is sometimes referred to as a “two-bagger.” The widespread and frequent use of this slang phrase serves as correlational evidence that the ICP (Instinctive Compulsion to Propagate) in males exerts a stronger influence on their behavior than their personal aesthetic ideals and values. Field studies have shown that human males will mate with physically unattractive females if they can disassociate themselves from the visual element of the experience. Females also experience a similar subjugation of aesthetic values, thus explaining the fact that most females close their eyes while engaged in the act of sexual intercourse.  BWLS (Bored With Life Syndrome) – Combined emotional feelings of depression, frustration, boredom and uselessness which manifest in married males and females after the initial sexual energy in their relationships has waned or disappeared. This emotional condition is often complicated further by the birth of children and can lead to clinical depression. The only effective modern cures for this emotional affliction are divorce or adultery. Research has shown that marriage counseling is ineffective in cases of BWLS.  DELUSION – anything you believe that a mental health professional personally disagrees with. Psychiatrists and psychologists operate under the premise that they are always right, in all matters. When a patient/client disagrees with them on any point whatsoever, that patient is labeled as delusional. When two mental health professionals disagree with each other, it is a case of double delusion.  DIVINE INTERVENTION (human female) – Onset of menstruation following unprotected sex with a loser who never called again.  DIVINE INTERVENTION (human male) – Divorce without payment of alimony or child support.  ECLECTIC APPROACH – A random, odd and generally ineffective therapeutic procedure, method or testing process utilized by a mental health therapist who has forgotten everything he or she ever learned in college.  FIELD RESEARCHER – male or female psychology, psychiatry or social work student or intern more interested in the color of a baboon’s ass in springtime than the welfare of their fellow man.  HYPOCHONDRIAC – a person suffering from one or more illnesses for which modern medical science has yet to find a means of diagnosing or treating. Medical doctors (due to embarrassment at their own incompetence) generally refer hypochondriacs to psychologists or psychiatrists for treatment. This causes depressed emotional states in hypochondriacs upon realization they will never receive legitimate medical treatment for their illness. Extended periods of this depressed emotional state sometimes result in spontaneous combustion of the sufferer - another phenomenon medical doctors and mental health professionals decline to acknowledge or study.  ICP (Instinctive Compulsion to Propagate) – The human male’s uncontrollable hormonally driven physical and emotional drive to mate with a human female (or any convenient substitute) to increase the distribution of his DNA in the human gene pool. This unstable condition occurs in men roughly between the onset of puberty and age 45. During this phase of life, the human male will say or do anything to motivate a female to engage in sexual intercourse, including manipulative use of the phrase “I love you,” or “Lets get married.”  INDUSTRIAL / ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST – a psychology pseudo-professional out of the mainstream who believes all of the world’s problems will someday be resolved through job analysis and standardized tests. In the world of industrial psychology, all human beings fit into precisely defined categories of personality and behavior.  LOBOTOMY – an arcane surgical procedure utilizing sharp, pointed instruments to poke a hole in a patient’s forehead in order to destroy brain tissue in the frontal lobe (and possibly exorcize demons). This procedure, originally thought to modify behavior and decrease impulsivity is now used to prepare candidates for service as U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army commissioned officers.  MARRIAGE – a socially acceptable, government approved partnership of two people desiring to engage in frequent, uninhibited, guilt-free, passionate copulation or other mutually stimulating physical activities without the accompanying burden of competition, courtship, respect, consideration or payment of prostitution fees. This arrangement is frequently complicated by the birth of children which forces the married couple to remain together (for the welfare of the children) long after they have lost interest in each other. Marriage is the number one cause of stress and stress related deaths and adultery.  MID-LIFE CRISIS (human male) – A psychological phase of the aging process originally theorized by Daniel J. Levinson, which provides a socially accepted rationalization (excuse) for married males between the ages of 40 and 50 to engage in adultery with women younger than their wives. The theory postulates that men are not responsible for their own behavior during this period due to the overwhelming mental distress generated by growing old. Many men experience heart attacks during this period, brought on by vigorous sexual activity with younger women or the side effects of excessive Viagara use.  MID-LIFE CRISIS (human female) – The period generally associated with menopause, normally in a female’s late forties, during which the female evolves beyond bitch to become a true incarnation of the devil. This condition is driven by hormonal changes and psychological crisis over the loss of ability to bear children. A woman who, during this period, murders her husband for engaging in adultery (rationalized by his own mid-life crisis) can use “menopause” as a mitigating circumstance in her court defense.  MOS (Missed Opportunity Syndrome) – An emotional feeling of emptiness and hopelessness often erroneously diagnosed as depression. MOS develops after a missed opportunity to have sexual intercourse with a healthy female of child-bearing age and disposition. This emotional condition normally occurs months or years after the break-up of a relationship between teens or young adults. Since the male ICP has been compromised, MOS is nature’s way of punishing a man for neglecting his genetic reproductive responsibility to spread his seed and propagate the species. There is no cure for MOS except marriage. After marriage, the MOS syndrome is eventually displaced by BWLS.  NERVOUS BREAKDOWN – A debilitating mental condition triggered unexpectedly by excessive stress from marriage, trauma from the sudden loss of self-esteem, or realization that one is no longer in control of the situation. The conscious mind (ego), which has had enough, goes on extended vacation and the unconscious mind (id) shuts down all physical systems when it discovers it can’t function effectively without the ego. There are as many treatments for this condition as there are psychologists and psychiatrists in the world. Patients suffering from this mental derailment generally show increased susceptibility to future attacks.  PANIC ATTACK – Instinctual, unreasonable over-reaction to a situation wherein the possible detrimental consequences of the reaction appear to be subordinate to the potential hazards or trauma of the situation:   mass panic attack – a wildly disorganized emotional and physical reaction by a crowd of people imagining impending doom, such as the stampede to exit a public building when someone yells “bomb,” “fire,” or “There is no cause for alarm.” This phenomenon is also observed in groups of women stampeding into a building because “The sale will end in five minutes.” The most chaotic form of this psychological behavior is displayed by entire populations prior to significant natural catastrophes like erupting volcanoes, the election of a Democrat for president, a comet five minutes away from striking and demolishing the earth, or McDonalds running out of Big Macs.  personal panic attack – emotional and physical over-reaction followed by shut down and sometimes somatic disposition of human beings who discover themselves in a negative interpersonal, social or environmental situation with dire consequences over which they have absolutely no control, such as a cheating wife caught in the act by her husband, a junior high school student caught smoking in the school bathroom by the principal, or the discovery that whitehouse.com does not take you to the White House where the president pretends to work. (Or you discover that it takes you to the site where the president and most of his staff do spend much of their time.) Exhaustive crying or hysterical laughter often accompany personal panic attacks.  professional panic attack – loud and prolonged verbal and physical temper tantrum engaged in by psychiatrists when a client/patient refuses to pay them for their alleged services.  REINFORCEMENT – action taken which causes a behavior to be repeated. There are two types of reinforcement:   negative reinforcement – Something tedious or undesirable taken away from a subject which causes the subject to repeat a desired behavior. A typical example of negative reinforcement is a psychology professor eliminating the requirement for homework so a student will continue to grant sexual favors.   positive reinforcement – Something given to a subject which causes the subject to repeat a desired behavior. A typical example of positive reinforcement is a female college student having sex with her college professor whenever he gives her an “A” on a paper or exam. Under most circumstances (provided the sex is good), the professor will continue to give that student high grades in anticipation of sexual favors. Psychology and psychiatry professors are highly susceptible to this type of manipulation since the sanctions for having sex with a student are not as serious or frequent as the professional sanctions in private practice for having sex with a client.   SAPI (Sexual Activity Probability Index) – A ten-point subjective scale used by human males to estimate the probability that a human female will engage in sexual intercourse on a first or second date without insisting on a more “permanent” relationship or “commitment.” Women with high SAPI scores achieve active social lives, higher overall rates of marriage, fewer bouts of loneliness and depression requiring therapy, and a higher rate of STD infections. Women sometimes mimic sexually provocative behaviors to trick men into awarding higher SAPI scores but this deception is normally discovered during the second or third date. The SAPI should not be confused with the AAI (Appearance Arousal Index). The AAI is a scale used to rate physical appearance, while the SAPI is a scale used to measure sexual behavior probability.  SELF ESTEEM – a false sense of self-worth implanted by mental health practitioners or elementary education teachers which fosters the delusion that a person is normal and happy in spite of being fat, stupid, ugly, uneducated, “special,” or otherwise out of accepted societal norms. This false sense of self-worth is normally abandoned when the believer applies for a job, purchases clothing, looks in the mirror, or suffers a painful heart attack brought on by excessive cholesterol in their coronary system.  SOCIAL WORKER – male or female underachiever with neither the financial nor intellectual capacity to earn or obtain a Masters or higher post-graduate degree in psychology or psychiatry, who nonetheless wants to meddle in other peoples’ lives due to their own pathetic lack of one.  TCS (Topic Confusion Syndrome) – A common mental disorientation that causes high school and college students to temporarily forget which class they are attending. The most common symptom of TCS is a student’s in-class question or statement to the instructor that has absolutely no relation to the topic being lectured or discussed at that moment. Data from current research shows strong evidence that TCS is caused by stray sexual stimulation pheromones in the classroom, or drug abuse.  TRANSFERENCE – in psychotherapy, the mechanical act of a duped client/patient, taking their hard-earned money and giving (transferring) it to the psychotherapist due to a delusional fantasy that the therapist is actually helping them resolve a problem. Psychotherapists would have the public believe the term has something to do with identifying the therapist with another person who has caused traumatic consequences in a patient’s personal life, but this is the basest form of deception. When psychiatrists speak to each other in private, transference is all about the redistribution of funds - from a bank account of the client to a bank account belonging to the therapist.

      A guy is browsing in a pet shop and sees a parrot sitting on a little Perch. It doesn't have any feet or legs. The guy says aloud, "Jeesh, I wonder what happened to this Parrot?"   The parrot says, "I was born this way. I'm a defective parrot."   "Holy crap," the guy replies. "You actually understood and answered me!""I got every word," says the parrot.   "I happen to be a highly intelligent, thoroughly educated bird.  "Oh yeah?" the guy asks, "Then answer this -- how do you hang onto your perch without any feet?"  "Well," the parrot says, "this is very embarrassing but since you asked, I wrap my weenie around this wooden bar like a little hook. You can't see it because of my feathers."  "Wow," says the guy. "You really can understand and speak English can't you?"  "Actually, I speak both Spanish and English, and I can converse with reasonable competence on almost any topic: politics, religion, sports, physics, philosophy. I'm especially good at ornithology. You really ought to buy me. I'd be a great companion."   The guy looks at the $200 price tag. "Sorry, but I just can't afford that."  "Pssssssst," says the parrot, "I'm defective, so the truth is nobody wants me. You can probably get me for $20,just make the guy an offer!"   The guy offers $20 and walks out with the parrot.W eeks go by. The parrot is sensational. He has a great sense of humor, he's interesting, he's a great pal, he understands everything, he sympathizes, and he's insightful. The guy is delighted.  One day the guy comes home from work and the parrot goes, "psssssssssssst," and motions him over with one wing. I don't know if I should tell you this or not, but it's about your wife and the postman."  "What are you talking about?" asks the guy.  "When the postman delivered the mail today, your wife greeted him at the door in a sheer black nightie and kissed him passionately."  "WHAT???" the guy asks incredulously.   "THEN what happened?""Well, then the postman came into the house and lifted up her nightie and began petting her all over," reported the parrot.  "Oh No!," he exclaims. "Then what?"  "Then he lifted up the nightie, got down on his knee and began to kiss her all over, starting with her breasts and slowly going down...."  "WELL," demands the frantic guy, "THEN WHAT HAPPENED?"  "Damned if I know. I got a hard-on and fell off my perch! "

      One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.  He invited all his neighbours to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down.  A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbours continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off!  Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a steppingstone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up.    Remember the five simple rules to be happy:  1. Free your heart from hatred - Forgive.  2. Free your mind from worries - Most never happen.  3. Live simply and appreciate what you have.  4. Give more.  5. Expect less  NOW --------  Enough of that crap . . .  The donkey later came back, and bit the shit out of the farmer who had tried to bury him. The gash from the bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in agony from septic shock.  MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON:  When you do something wrong, and try to cover your ass, it always comes back to bite you. Hehehe...

      By: Chong See Ming  Journaling has long been recommended as a beneficial tool in self awareness and understanding. Journaling has been said to nurture one's spirituality and build inroads into our unconscious minds.  Journal advocates say that journaling is the perfect way to take inventory of ourselves and our feelings, resolve conflicts, make decisions and bring clarity to our lives as well as to record our personal spiritual journey.  For me, it's always been a balm for my soul. As I record my thoughts, dreams, desires and feelings, my self-knowledge increases. Call it mental detoxification, mindful spring-cleaning, or any other terms, journaling for me is a form of meditation that de-clutters any mental confusion.Let's explore in detail some of the key advantages of keeping a journal:-  Journaling is an affordable method of self-therapy  A journal doesn't have to be an expensive hard-cover, bounded notebook with a built-in lock. I know some people who use thin school exercise books costing only 80 cents each, but as thoughts flow, the desired effect will still be the same. If you are technology-savvy, an online blog will cost next to nothing. Check out Blogger for free blogging tools. (And read Najah Nasseri's article on Blogging, this issue of ProDigy)  Journaling helps us solve problems  No matter how cliché is seems - the phrase "The answer lies within us" has been historically proven. Through journaling, we can start sifting through the whirlpools of our minds to find answers to issues that bother us.  Journaling helps us to excavate our authentic selves  In the noise of everyday world, we often prevented from listening to our inner voices. We are "polished" by what our family, friends and society demands of us whereby we gradually adopt mannerisms and values that may contradict who we were originally. The danger of losing ourselves this way is we may stop living the life we crave and live our lives for others. John Holt, an American educator described this problem exactly when he wrote in his book, Never Too Late: My Musical Life Story, " ...it is not easy to find out what we like or want, when all our lives, other people work trying not just to make us do what they want, but to make us think that we want to do it."  Journaling helps us listen to ourselves  Writing a journal may re-orientate us on the journey of self-discovery as it is a good way to let our inner voice comes through the hustle and bustle of our surroundings.  Putting our thoughts on paper could also help uncover the hidden mental obstacles which are stunting our growth, and help us become more aware of the negativity in our thoughts and resolve them.  Journaling is a healthy way to release pent-up emotions  In her book, Write Away, A Journal Writing Tool Kit, Eldonna Bouton asks "Think about how often you have been asked how you were and you automatically responded with "Fine." How many times were you really not fine, or worse, but couldn't really say how you were really feeling?"  A blank page is a safe place to dump anger and frustrations without hurting anyone. Releasing our feelings to the page may actually help them subside. We can use the journaling process to help us work through stressful events without the fear of social consequences, especially things that we don't want to discuss with friends or family.  Ultimately, this connection can reduce stress and keeps us healthy.  Journaling is an investment in ourselves  It does not require any skill or talent, just a willingness to write when we feel like it. We benefit from the self-expression and increased awareness of our thoughts and feelings.  In this way, journaling complements our life-long learning process as we document our experiences and learn as much as we can from them.  You might say I've kept a diary before but nothing came out of it. Well, unlike the diary of the past, where you dutifully recorded the events of the day, be clear that this new journal's purpose is to capture emotions and documenting feeling and sentiments. By capturing your thoughts on paper, you open communications links between your subconscious mind and your conscious mind, allowing your subconscious to emerge. And it might just help you solve the mystery of who you really are. Try it.  5 Quick Tips for Journal Keeping Commitment Keep your journal with you in your bag or somewhere conspicuous where you will always see it and be reminded. Block 10 minutes or more everyday as writing time.  The right tools Having the right tools can make the experience more enjoyable. Use your favourite pen and for longevity, write on acid-free, hand-made paper.  Date Date every entry as far as possible, make a note of the time, place and even weather. You will find these information useful in the future.  Find a support group Get your close friends to remind you to write in it. Get on to a jounal-writing mailing list - There's plenty on Yahoo Groups.  Be true to yourself Remember the best journal is one that is entirely YOU - so create your own rules, whatever that strikes your fancy.

      CAPRICORN  22 December – 21 January  WOMEN: Don’t need much foreplay - you go straight from zero to WOW in nothing flat! Not interested in exotic variation; only staying in power. Since you like to dominate, you like to be astride your man, set a rhythm, and please yourself. Once into a rhythm, lovemaking becomes a wild contest with orgasm as the prize and you can depend on getting here more than once. Also a scratcher and a screamer.   Best sex mates: Taurus, Scorpio and Pisces.  MEN: Sex evokes the best he can offer. He is a planner and a schemer (that is schemer, not a screamer!). Prefers a woman who knows what he enjoys, and he expects her to be willing and ready whenever he wants her. Has the stamina of a marathon runner. Here is the man who will hold off until you are ready to scream! Erogenous zone: a massage that starts at the lower back and gently strokes upward along the sides of his spine.   AQUARIUS 22 January – 21 February  WOMEN: A slow starter, you idealise love and encompass it with tenderness. Once aroused though, anything goes! Extremely imaginative and likes to try new things. There is nothing in any sex manual that you won’t try. Belief that anything that increases the pleasure for your partner is worthwhile.   Best sex mates: Aries, Gemini, Libra, Sagittarius and Aquarius. Favourite sex position: standing up, and in water.  MEN: Never treats a woman like a sex object and prefers a variety of foreplay before getting down to it. May have to be revved up, but once his engine is started, he is free and inventive with amazing persistence. He will always see you through to climax. A woman that knows what she wants will be very happy. He usually ensures an orgasm twice - once orally and once genitally. Erogenous zones gently touching the calves and ankles will get him going. Be careful though - a kinky Aquarium can be a sadist who doesn’t like to be denied!   PISCES 22 February – 21 March  WOMEN: Always make the right moves, say the right things, and create the right ambience. You are sexually liberated and enjoy a wide range of eroticism. If his fantasies coincide with yours, the action can really get torrid! You seldom say no to anything your lover suggests!   Favourite places: in a waterbed or hot tub. Best sex mates: Cancer, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces.  MEN: Takes the lead in lovemaking and impatient if he doesn’t get a swift response. Indifferent to sexual restrictions, both moral and legal; prefers a partner with a tremendous sexual craving. Likes sex in a chair. He likes to be submissive. Becomes an addict to anything that will give pleasure and release. Erogenous zones: massaging and caressing his feet.   ARIES 22 March – 21 April  WOMEN: Wildly sensual, passionate and adventurous. You’ll have sex anywhere, you know what you want - intense and frequent sex, you have a need for complete control, but you’re also in love with love. As a mate, you are ardent, loyal, sentimental, and earthly. Biggest thrill - the tickle of a man’s facial fuzz.  MEN: Sleeping with him is like playing croquet with live bombs you never know what is going to happen! Never expect him to wait for you to be ready - he will rip your clothes off if he is ready to go. Don’t tease him or you’d better be ready to deliver. Fond of slave master games and he likes it rough. Aries men are also explorers, so be ready to go where no woman has gone before. His favourite position -a woman on her knees leaning forward.   TAURUS 22 April – 21 May  WOMEN: You expect your man to be kind and patient and make love to you by the book. Like to be pleased by sex, but don’t look for unusual approaches. But you are a demanding lover and leave your partner breathless. You have a need for oral gratification, both giving and receiving.   Best sex mates: Cancer, Sagittarius, Scorpio, and Leo. Most likely kink: sucking on your toes, one by one. You also like biting. hmmm!  MEN: He is the ideal lover - sensitive and understanding of his partner’s feelings. He prefers it slow and easy; he won’t be your guide to the exotic unknown, but that he does, he does beautifully. This is the guy to go for long and luxurious oral sex. Stamina? This man could wear down a glacier! His erogenous zone: gently and slowly kiss and bite the back of his neck.   GEMINI  22 May – 21 June  WOMEN: Often the aggressor; you are never embarrassed by your behaviour because you never adhere to any standards except your own. Your main requirement: a lover who knows how to take his time. You are a one woman harem, but a partner should be aware that in a relationship, the Gemini woman is looking for a combination of the spiritual and the physical, the romantic and the practical. You want to talk to the guy after you tumble with him!   Best sex mates are Leo, Scorpio, Aquarians, Libra, and Aries. Favourite gadget: the vibrator.  MEN: He likes it with the lights on in front of a mirror. He can work any partner into the mood because he knows exactly how to evoke the right responses. Oral sex isn’t his favourite pastime, but will take his time with the other preliminaries. Tends to be fast and furious, more concerned with satisfying himself than his partner, but he is more than adequate in areas of lovemaking that are often neglected by other men. He can tell a woman exactly what she wants to hear. His erogenous zone: move your lips and tongue lightly up his arm.   CANCER 22 June – 21 July  WOMEN: Will never make the first move, but you can be a marvelous lover for you are capable of intense sensuality. You will reciprocate passion with a fever that will stir his heart and stimulate him to his best performance. On your own time, you have a fondness for masturbation. Your favourite position: lying prone while your man enters you from behind.   Best sex mates: Taurus, Leo, Virgo, Scorpio, and Pisces. You may become a slave to sexual pleasure!   MEN: His most surprising technique: intercourse with no hands. He has a need for constant encouragement and if gotten, he will be a delightful swain. Both patient and aggressive, he will often begin somewhere other than bad: likes being in command, and is a master at manual clitoral manipulation! You’ll like the trip as it as much travelling to a place as it is arriving.   LEO 22 July – 21 August  WOMEN: Sleek, lascivious, enticing and lazy! Whatever Leo wants, Leo gets! Intensely responsive and there are bed partners who have scars to prove it. Your need to show off leads you to prefer the top where he can look up and admire the beauty of your body.   Best sex mates: Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, and Aries. Your sexual wardrobe: full of wispy cutout bras and panties!  MEN: Simply brushes aside rules and conventions. One important rule to remember about him: NEVER tease. His endurance is remarkable and he has a great appetite for making love. He likes women in the submissive position and oral sex is okay when he is on the receiving end. He likes a woman to show how much she is enjoying it. His erogenous zone: his back is particularly vulnerable.   VIRGO 22 August – 21 September  WOMEN: You have no illusions about sex and wish everyone would stop magnifying its importance. Prefer men who will wait for the relationship to develop to the point where sex is inevitable. You love mutual masturbation and enjoy a little punishment and your grace and modesty is a great turn on. You become an artist at pleasing your lover.   Favourite kink: can’t truly enjoy it unless a third party is present. Best sex mates: Gemini, Cancer and Aquarius.   MEN: Too shy to make an overture, but when the moment arrives, you had better be prepared for him to bring his pyjamas, shaving equipment, and toothbrush. He likes to talk about how you like it and having talked about it, he will key in on the right erotic response. Don’t expect imagination, but he is a hard worker and is open to suggestion. His secret life: can be obsessed with pornography. Erogenous zones: his buttocks.    LIBRA 22 September – 21 October  WOMEN: Drama is the key word - you set the stage for sex. Intensely feminine and an instinctive exhibitionist. You feel your body was made to be seen and admired. Feel that seduction is an art, not an assault. When approached the right way, you find it easy to say yes to almost anything. Unusual control of vaginal muscles.   Best sex mates: Aries, Gemini, Leo, Scorpio, Sagittarius, and Aquarius. Like any position where your buttocks are exposed.  MEN: Looks for the whole experience, not just a tumble between the sheets. Has a definite kinky side, a voyeur and fond of the ‘menage–a–trois’. He has the patience needed to satisfy. He like women who dress well and have long hair. If a woman’s clothes look as though they are easily removed, he finds her hard to ignore. Erogenous zone: back and buttocks, especially the feel of erect nipples against either of them!    SCORPIO 22 October – 21 November  WOMEN: Inquisitive, searching and experimental. Knows that eroticism consists of more than the physical act of lovemaking. While looking like a perfect lady in public, you dress and act like a whore in the bedroom. Control of the orgasm is very important and will try anything to help your man maintain his potency. You never take no for an answer and when interested in someone, you will pursue him with determination and guile.   Best sex mates: Gemini, Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. Props you love: scented body oils, flavoured lubricating gels, and vibrators.   MEN: A lustful, sexy animal. Enjoys biting and sucking and is a master of oral sex. Inflicting pain turns him on so he may pinch at nipples or the inside of thighs. Likes it in water, but his kink is that the prefers wooden tables and hard floors to satin and silk. His erogenous zone is his genitalia.    SAGITTARIUS 22 November – 21 December  WOMEN: You like the outdoors - freaking out if you are in a tent, camper, or on the beach. You enjoy sex, but you don’t like to prolong the preliminaries and want to start the main show as soon as possible. Like to tease your partner to the point of losing control. You don’t mind if your partner comes too quickly – you are a generous and accepting lover.   Best sex mates: Leo, Libra, and Aquarius. Your sexual wardrobe will consist of accessories - gloves and shoes!   MEN: Sex is rarely an intense experience with him - he often comes too quickly, but he’ll be the first to try a new position. He is the master of erotic massage - both oral and manual. His tongue can be a wicked instrument and when combined with his lips, creates an explosive effect! Erogenous zones: hips and thighs. And he likes to look at a woman’s calves and thighs, and likes to have sex with a woman in stockings.

      Special for eDiets by Nikki Goldbeck CDN   "My doctor has advised me to give up those intimate little dinners for four, unless there are three other people eating with me." --Orson Wells   The other day a colleague told me about a government website with an interactive quiz comparing today’s portions to typical portions 20 years ago, including both calories and the amount of physical activity it takes to burn those calories. As someone who has always prided myself on my ability to count calories in my head, I looked forward to the challenge. Suffice it to say, I am no longer so confident in my calorie-estimating talents.   (If your ego can take it, give it a try at http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/portion/.)   The supersizing of food and its effect has certainly gotten plenty of notice. One estimation is that servings in U.S. restaurants are two to 10 times the size of those recommended by the U.S. Food Guide Pyramid. Moreover, according to a 2001 survey by the American Institute for Cancer Research, this doesn’t stop 67 percent of Americans from finishing their meals most of the time. This Clean Plate Club attitude is clearly one cause of our ever-expanding national waistline.   The supersizing of soft drinks is a perfect example (and the only question I was confident about in the online quiz). A 12-ounce can of regular soda (already an increase from the original 6.5-ounce bottle) contains 150 calories, while the 20- to 36-ounce mega-cups typically purchased at the movies can climb from 300 to 450 calories.   And although certainly not limited to fast food restaurants, a regular meal can easily turn into mega-calories when it is supersized. Here’s what happens to a typical burger combination:   REGULAR MEAL (regular burger, regular fries and 16-ounce soft drink) ·  Approximately 625 calories  ·  About 4 tsp. of fat (19 grams)  ·  1/4-cup sugar   SUPER COMBO (double burger with cheese, supersize fries and drink) ·  1,800 calories  ·  About 17 tsp. of fat (84 grams)  ·  3/4 cup sugar ...   A recent Tufts University Health and Nutrition Letter reported that restaurants serve some entrées with an entire day’s worth of what the Food Guide Pyramid considers “grain and meat servings.” For example, an order of spaghetti  and meatballs at Olive Garden equals 10 servings of grains and 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 servings of meat.   And when it comes to “imported foods,” once they are Americanized so too is their size:  ·  The American croissant contains about 100 more calories than the average one in France.  ·  When the bagel first arrived from Poland, it weighed 1 1/2 ounces and contained 116 calories. Today’s American bagel is about triple the size and contains over 300 calories (or as much as 4 slices of bread).  ·  In Mexico, a cheese quesadilla is a 5-inch tortilla estimated at 540 calories. The American version is generally 10 inches and contains over 1,200 calories.  But enough of this discouraging news. If you’re putting on pounds -- or aim to take them off -- check those portion sizes. (And remember, just an extra 100 calories daily beyond your needs can lead to a weight gain of 10 pounds a year.)  To estimate your food intake based on “serving sizes,” here are some ways to visualize how much you’re really getting (without having to weigh or measure):  (EDITOR'S NOTE: Since hands and fingers vary from person to person, think of a modest size individual. And remember, these are only guides.)   Breads, Grains and Cereals  1/2 cup cooked cereal or grain = cupcake wrapper full  1 cup cooked pasta or grain = a walkman, tennis ball, man's fist  2 cups pasta or grain = a full outstretched hand  1 cup dried cereal = large handful  1 slice bread = audiocassette tape  1 pancake = compact disc (CD)   Vegetables  1/2 cup cut up vegetables = tennis ball, light bulb 1 cup cut up vegetables = man's fist  1/2 cup serving = 6 asparagus spears; 7 or 8 baby carrots or carrot sticks 1 medium potato = computer mouse 1 cup lettuce = 4 lettuce leaves  1 cup salad = baseball, man's fist   Fruit  1 medium fruit = tennis ball, man's fist 1/2 cup cut-up fruit = 7 cotton balls, 15 marbles 1 cup fruit = baseball, man's fist 1/2 cup grapes = 15 grapes   Milk & Dairy Foods 1 oz. cheese = 4 dice, your thumb 1 1/2 oz. natural cheese = 3 dominoes, a 9-volt battery, bar of hotel soap, your index and middle fingers  1/2 cup ice cream = tennis ball  1 cup ice cream = baseball ... More >>   Meat and Nonmeat Proteins 1 oz. meat = match box or floppy diskette 3 oz. meat = deck of cards, cassette tape 4 oz. meat = palm of the hand  3 oz. grilled or baked fish = checkbook 3 oz.  cooked chicken = a chicken leg and thigh or breast 1 tsp. peanut butter = tip of finger to first joint  1 Tbsp. peanut butter = tip of thumb to first joint, 1 dice 2 Tbsp. peanut butter = ping pong ball 1 cup beans = baseball   Concentrated Fats and Other High-Fat Foods 1 tsp. butter, oil, salad dressing, mayonnaise = tip of finger to first joint 1 Tbsp. butter, oil, salad dressing, mayonnaise = tip of thumb to first joint, one dice 2 Tbsp. butter, oil, salad dressing, mayonnaise = ping pong ball  1 oz. chips or pretzels = one modest handful  1/3 cup chips, crackers or popcorn = woman's handful  1/2 cup chips, crackers or popcorn = man's handful   Concentrated Sugars and Other Sweetened Foods  one slice cake = width of two fingers  wedge pie = width of three fingers   Serving Dishes/Utensils 1/2 cup = small fruit bowl, custard cup, mashed potato scoop 1 1/2 cups = large cereal/soup bowl, dinner on a dinner plate (not heaped) 4 oz. liquid = tea cup, small juice glass 8 oz. liquid = water glass   ...............

      The Electric Shock Kiss: The two of you shuffle your feet furiously on the carpet. When you both have an electric charge, lean over and slowly aim for each other's lips. With your lips about one-half inch apart, move in even slower until a spark jumps between the two of you. Instantly after this happens, kiss one another...    The Eye Test Kiss: Make an eye chart like the kind that you see in a doctor's office where the letters get progressively smaller. Have the chart read, "If you can read this you are standing close enough to kiss me." Now find your love and give an eye exam.    The Angel Kiss: Every one loves having their ear nibbled on because it just feels heavenly. Well, next time you're with your love, go in for a kiss, but gently nibble on his or her lower lip. I'm sure they'll think you're an angel.    The Pillow Fight Kiss: Start a pillow fight with the pillows sitting on the sofa while watching TV. When they finally start fighting back, make sure you move enough so they miss you and then say, "Missed me, missed me, now you've gotta kiss me!!" and then wait for them to come in for the kiss.    The Word of the Day Kiss: This will drive your partner wild. Pick any phrase or word - and whenever your partner says it during the course of the day... grab them and give them a huge kiss! They will wonder what all the kissing is about, and it is fun to keep them guessing at what is causing all of the attention!    The Teasing Kiss: He'll kiss, but then he gently pulls away, just enough so that she can barely feel his tongue on her lips. When she tries to pull closer to him he pulls farther away. When she finally stops trying to get closer, and she closes her mouth, he gently starts kissing her again. Try this and have your loved one go CRAZY!!! Just don't keep this up for too long.    The Popcicle Kiss: Right before greeting your significant other, eat a popcicle, or some other cold dessert treat. Not only will the flavor draw them, but the contrast of your cold mouth against their warm one will be very enticing.    The Dinner Kiss: If your love is making dinner when you come home. Walk up softly behind her, put your hands on her shoulders and gently kiss the nape of her (or his) neck from the base to just below the ear while murmuring how wonderful it is to come home to dinner.    Commercial Kisses: The next time you and your significant other are sitting around watching TV, make it a goal to kiss through every set of commercials that comes on during the course of the evening. Not only will it keep you from suffering through 2 minutes of advertisements, but it may lead to making a show of your own...    The Hide & Seek Kiss: Play hide & seek at home. Usually the places where you hide will be dark and cosy. When your partner finds you, the mood and atmosphere would be just right for a long sweet kiss! And the game goes on...    The Good-Things-Come-to-Those-Who-Wait Kiss: Start your kiss small scale and gradually turn on the heat. Don't show your love everything that you have right away. Let them anticipate what you are saving for later.    The Hard to Get Kiss: When your mate wants a kiss, don't give it to him/her right away. Let your mate be anxious to get the kiss, then when you do kiss him/her, it will be more wanted and better. You can even make it a game.    Kissing Memories: Sit close to your love and whisper to each other the memories you have about the first time you kissed. Talk about what it was in that first kiss that made you know that you wanted to kiss them again and again and...well you get the idea. It turns into a very romantic experience.    The Butterfly Flutter: Place your eye within a breath of your partner's cheek. Open and close your eyelids against her skin. If this is done correctly, the flutter sensation on her cheek should match the one in her heart.    The Strawberry Kiss: I just read this weeks news letter and I wanted to send you my favorite kiss idea. Dip a strawberry in whipped cream, put it in your mouth and have your sweetie bite the half that sticks out. As his lips touch yours, you can kiss...    The Liquid Kiss: Drink a small amount of moderately cold water, and hold it in your mouth. (could be any good liquid actually) Place your mouth against your partner's and transfer the water to his/her mouth. After they swallow it, use the moisture to prolong an increasingly warm, deep tongue kiss - kind of like from a cool mint to a volcano!!!!! This is a symbolic ritual with me, and it is an awesome turn-on for the girls.    The Sexy Kiss: If done correctly, this kiss can drive you both into a heated frenzy. The only things allowed to touch are the lips. As you get heated, the tongue is optional, but nothing else touches, including hands, bodies, etc.

      By Chris Josefowicz June 22, 2004     The brain-body connection seems to be stronger than most people realize. Shaking a leg (or curling a bicep) doesn't just make you stronger, healthier and better looking. It also helps your brain shrug off the effects of aging.   Thanks to brain-imaging studies in humans and neurochemical studies in animals, scientists have found that exercise actually develops a stronger brain. Physical exertion induces the cells in the brain to reinforce old connections between nerve cells and to forge new connections. This denser neuron network makes you better able to process and store information, essentially resulting in a smarter brain.   Best of all, exercisers do not need the endurance of an iron man to benefit. For older people in particular, even a moderate program of exercise can boost brain health and cognition. Much of this new research focuses on a substance called BDNF, for brain-derived neurotrophic factor. This chemical helps nerve cells grow and connect. It's also important for fetal development.   Now it turns out to be critical in the adult brain as well. The benefits of BDNF are broad. Animals with boosted BDNF navigate mazes faster. Brain injuries heal faster. The brain chemical wards off depression.   It works by actually rewiring the brain. BDNF if one of the tools a brain uses to turn life experiences into long-lasting changes, influencing everything from memory to mood. And boosting BDNF may be simple to do. Scores of studies during the past decade show that short stints of exercise -- say, even a few minutes of swimming -- increase BDNF in the brains of animals.   The dynamics of BDNF are harder to study in people, but researchers have used imaging techniques to show that exercise helps human brains too. It postpones the effect of aging on the brain.   Everyone's brain loses nerve tissue as it ages, beginning in the third decade of life. But people who exercise lose brain tissue more slowly than non-exercisers. Imaging studies show their brains are dense with neurons and connections among neurons.   Exercise does more than simply preserve brain tissue -- it can also improve thinking. In a recent comparison of 18 studies, inactive older adults who began an exercise routine got significantly better at cognitive tests than measured skills such as planning and paying attention.   The kind of exercise that makes a difference is not hard to tackle. A brisk 45-minute jaunt three times a week will do it. Even young people can expect to see some brain benefits from exercising -- an improved ability to handle complex cognitive tasks and protection against the effects of aging.

      We all think eating fruits means just buying fruits, cutting it and just popping it into our mouths. It's not so easy as you think. It's important to know how and when to eat. What is the correct way of eating fruits?  IT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS! FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN IN AN EMPTY STOMACH.  If you eat fruit like that, it will play a major role to detoxify your system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities.  FRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD  Let's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit. The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines, but it is prevented from doing so. In the meantime the whole meal rots and ferments and turns to acid. The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil. So please eat your fruits in an empty stomach or before your meals!  You have heard people complaining - every time I eat water-melon I burp, when I eat durian my stomach bloats up, when I eat banana I feel like running to the toilet etc - actually all this will not arise if you eat the fruit in an empty stomach. The fruit mixes with the putrefying other food and produces gas and hence you will bloat! Graying hair, balding, nervous outburst, dark circles under the eyes all these will not happen if you take fruits in an empty stomach. There is no such thing as some fruits like orange an d lemon are acidic because all fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Sehlton who did a research on this matter.  If you have mastered the correct way of eating fruits, you have the secret of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight. When you need to ! drink fruit juice - drink only fresh fruit juice, NOT from the cans. Don't even drink juice that has been heated up. Don't eat cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all. You only get to taste. So stop making 'goreng pisang' or 'durian porridge' if you want nutrients. Cooking destroys all the vitamins. But eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice. If you should drink the juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly, because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it.   You can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse your body. Just eat fruits and drink fruit juice throughout the 3 days and you will be surprise when your friends tell you how radiant you look! During the fruit fast you can eat fruits, prepared in salad forms and make it more interesting.

      1. Nurture blessings and hope in your own life and in the life of your community. Promote solidarity and cooperation. Dont leave the poor behind for the wolves to devour.  2. Learn how to grow your own food. Plant fruit and nut trees, berry bushes, and other perennial food crops. Preserve heirloom varieties of plants and animals. Buy as much food as possible from local farmers and local processors. Encourage schools and churches to start gardens. Dont buy any meats, eggs, or poultry from the Confined Animal Feeding Operation system. If you can't find local animal products produced with sustainable and humane practices, become a vegetarians. Do your part to help develop a local food system.  3. Use energy frugally. Know how much energy you are personally using and which way your energy usage trend is going. Walk, take public transportation, or ride a bicycle, wherever possible. Super insulate your dwelling and avoid air conditioning as much as possible. Remember that "stuff" has energy embodied in its manufacture and distribution.  4. Practice personal detachment from material goods. Remember that you are NOT your stuff. Reduce, reuse, recycle, repair, make do, do without, use less stuff. Patronize the aftermarket in places like swap meets, thrift stores, and flea markets. Avoid new stuff as much as possible, dont buy clothing made in sweatshops, limit your consumption of resources, including water.  5. The borrower is the slave of the lender. Flee the bondage of debt. If you must borrow money for education or housing, pay it off as quickly as you can, always make extra principle payments on loans. Never finance frivolous consumption with borrowed money on credit cards.  6. Dont let the perfect become the enemy of the good. Do what you can, with what you have, where you are. As you change your lifestyle to be more just and sustainable, dont attempt too much at first. Set incremental goals and meet them. BE willing to start small, or it is likely you will never start at all. But beware of procrastination.  7. Learn many things. Practice many skills. Teach others. Be ready to adapt to major changes that may come your way.  8. Accept responsibility for your own life, but understand your interdependence with others and the importance of community. Be aware of your environment and how your lifestyle impacts the community and world you live in and other people. What I do doesn't matter is a lie we tell ourselves to make ourselves feel better about doing wrong. Watch out for dangers and disasters that ay be ahead, and act in advance to mitigate the impact of such events. The Bible says, Remember the time of hunger in the day of plenty.The time to build the cellar is before the tornado hits.  9. Avoid big box corporation stores and franchise chains. Buy from local businesses and if possible try to earn a living and spend your money outside of the corporation dominated globalized economy. Organize cooperatives and start small businesses to replace unsustainable globalized business structures. Keep your money in a credit union.  10. Support political and voluntary initiatives that promote sustainability and resilience, such as public transportation, energy efficiency, renewable energy resources, small farms, decentralized economics, balanced government budgets, ad local markets.

      1. Don't imagine you can change a man - unless he's in diapers.  2. What do you do if your boyfriend walks-out? You shut the door.  3. If they put a man on the moon - they should be able to put them all up there.  4. Never let your man's mind wander - it's too little to be out alone.  5. Go for younger men. You might as well - they never mature anyway.  6. Men are all the same - they just have different faces, so that you can tell them apart.  7. Definition of a bachelor; a man who has missed the opportunity to make some woman miserable.  8. Women don't make fools of men - most of them are the do-it-yourself types.  9. Best way to get a man to do something, is to suggest he is too old for it.  10. Love is blind, but marriage is a real eye-opener.  11. If you want a committed man, look in a mental hospital.  12. The children of Israel wandered around the desert for 40 years. Even in biblical times, men wouldn't ask for directions.  13. If he asks what sort of books you're interested in, tell him cheque books.  14. Remember a sense of humor does not mean that you tell him jokes, means that you laugh at his.  15. Sadly, all men are created equal.

      Did you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is sexually active or not?   1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when women make love they produce amounts of the hormone estrogen, which makes hair shine and skin smooth.  2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses the pores and makes your skin glow.  3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that romantic dinner.  4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!  5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases endorphins into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and leaving you with a feeling of well-being.  6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called pheromones. These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!  7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.  8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid that causes decay,preventing plaque build-up.  9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.  10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a natural antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.

      By Dr. Robert A. Eubanks  -------------------------------------------------   We’ve all read about personal goal setting. We’ve all tried  it. According to the stats, most of the time we all fail.   Remember that dreaded New Year’s Resolution. This is the  mother of all goal setting bombs. This is when we set lofty  goals that we really, really want to accomplish but our  efforts rarely make it beyond our New Year’s Eve hang over.  I often used to slapped hand to forehead and muttered through  clinched teeth, 'Idiot!' after realizing that I have, yet  again failed to accomplish even the simplest of personal  goals (much less the grand New Year’s goal). Over the years,  though, I have managed to develop a cohesive method for curing this ailment (as well as curing the ever-present handprint on  my forehead).   Making a positive use of the once negative 'pet' name that I  had for myself, I developed 'Idiot’s Guide to Goal Setting'.  Ready to cure the ever-present handprint on your forehead?   First, there are a few pre-requisites before launching forth.   Before we even get out of the gate, we must first get beyond  the list of things that 'should' be our goals and first commit  to making ourselves priority and believing that what WE want  IS important! Too often we are convinced that what we should  do for ourselves is what we want to do for ourselves. This is not the case.   Push aside the 'should' thoughts and focus on what you  passionately want for yourself. What are you willing to commit  to and see through to the end?   Okay, now that that’s out of the way, we can start on the path to realizing true goal achievement, right? Not so fast.   In order for this goal to be different from all of the others  you have set, you must first have a support system that will  uphold you when the tide of daily life rigors begins to rise.  This is the essential ingredient that most people don’t  include when they make a commitment to change. This is where  the 5 steps begin.   These steps are designed to help you create goals that are  clear, specific, and planned out with the necessary support  and accountability to make goal setting a success.  5 steps to success with goal setting  1. Keep It Simple!  There's a temptation, to generate a list of everything you’ve  ever wanted to change. Don't fall for it! You'll have better  luck fulfilling one or two goals than you will with a list of  fifty. You can always add new goals to your list later. Take  one thing at a time.  2. Be Specific  Let's say your goal is to create a better balanced life  between health, relationships, and work. Word this carefully.  Try not to think of it as "I am going to balance my life."  That's a tall glass of stress ready to be gulped! It forces  you into thinking of the resolution as something you must do,  not something you want to do.   Try to make it sound a little gentler: "I'm now going to  explore different ways of balancing my life." This also  suggests more of a plan. You will fulfill the goal by  experimenting with strategies for life balance.   The first phrasing sounds as if you're going to force yourself  to have a balanced life by sheer willpower.  3. Make the Plan  Once you know what your goal is, plan it out in clear steps.  Your plan doesn't have to be a complicated one. Start by  answering the question, 'What is the first step I need to  take toward accomplishing my goal?'   For life balance, it might look like this:  1.) Work no more than 40 hours a week 2.) Walk 3 times a week 3.) Create a date night for significant relationships  4. Write it Down  Write down your goal and your plan of action. Stick it up on  the fridge or in your office. Write in the activities in your  day timer or wherever you know you'll see it. That way you'll have a constant reminder of the resolution.   5. Get Support!  Consider hiring a life coach. Accountability, support,  guidance and clarity are the prime focuses of these  practitioners. Each coaching session is devoted completely to  setting and accomplishing your goals. Unlike family and  friends, a coach is objective, well trained and committed to  seeing your goals come to fruition.   A life coach can step in at any point along your journey.  Whether you’ve arrived at Step 4 or if Step 1 has almost  created a mental meltdown, the coach will help create the  foundation from which your personal goals will be built.   Regardless of the goals you set for yourself, what is most  important is making yourself priority and committing to  living the best life possible with the minimal amount of  handprints on your forehead!   -------------------------------------------------  Dr. Robert A. Eubanks is the founder of Bridge to Solutions  Coaching. He coaches people around the country via telephone  to improve organization, time management, goal setting and  to create the best darn life possible!

      (Writer is unknown)   Young and newly married, I relaxed under a pecan tree on a hot Texas summer day, drinking iced tea and getting to know my new sister-in-law, Estelle. Not much older than I, but already the mother of three, Estelle seemed to me experienced and wise. "Get yourself some girlfriends" she advised, clinking the ice cubes in her glass. "You are going to need girlfriends. Go places with them; do things with them."  What a funny piece of advice, I thought. Hadn't I just gotten married? Hadn't I just joined the couple-world? I was a married woman, for goodness sake, not a young girl who needed girlfriends. But I listened to this new sister-in-law. I got myself some girlfriends.  As the years tumbled by, one after another, gradually I came to understand that Estelle knew what she was talking about. I remembered that she had said the word "girlfriends" with emphasis. As I went along, I discovered the subtle difference between friends and girlfriends. You go to work with  friends, go to dinner with friends, go to church with friends, belong to clubs with friends. You send friends greeting cards. You need friends in your life; all girlfriends were once only friends.  But a girlfriend is different. I offer this praise of girlfriends. Here is what I found out about girlfriends: Girlfriends don't compete. Girlfriends keep your children, and keep your secrets. Girlfriends give advice when you ask for it. Sometimes you take it, sometimes you don't. Girlfriends don't always tell you that you're right, but they're always honest. Girlfriends still love you, even when they don't agree with your choices. Girlfriends might send you a birthday card, but they might not. It does matter in the least. Girlfriends laugh with you and you don't need canned jokes to start the laughter. Girlfriends don't talk about you behind your back. Girlfriends pull you out of jams. Girlfriends don't keep a calendar that lets them know who hosted the other last. And girlfriends are there for you, in an instant and truly, when the hard times come. Girlfriends listen when you lose a job or a husband. Girlfriends listen when your children break your heart. Girlfriends listen when your parents' minds and bodies fail. My girlfriends bless my life. Once we were young, with no idea of the incredible joys or the incredible sorrows that lay ahead. Nor did we know how much we would need each other.  Take my sister-in-law's advice. Get yourself some girlfriends. You are going  to need them, whether you are married, have kids or just in a wonderful relationship!

      Marty wakes up at home with a huge hangover.  He forces himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins and a glass of water on the side table.  He sits up and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed.  Marty looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotless, clean. So is the rest of the house.  He takes the aspirins and notices a note on the table "Honey, breakfast is on the stove. I left early to go shopping. Love you."  So he goes to the kitchen and sure enough there is a hot breakfast and the morning newspaper.  His son is also at the table, eating.     Marty asks, "Son, what happened last night?"  His son says, "Well, you came home after 3am, drunk and delirious. You broke some furniture, puked in the hallway, and gave yourself a black eye when you stumbled into the door."  Confused, Marty asks, "So, why is everything in order and so clean, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me?"  His son replies, "Oh that! Mom dragged you to the bedroom, and when she tried to take your pants off, you said, 'Lady, leave me alone, I'm married!'"  Conclusion: A self-induced hangover - $100.00 Broken furniture - $200.00 Breakfast - $10.00 Saying the right thing - PRICELESS

      One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.  He invited all his neighbours to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down.  A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbours continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off!  Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a steppingstone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up.    Remember the five simple rules to be happy:  1. Free your heart from hatred - Forgive.  2. Free your mind from worries - Most never happen.  3. Live simply and appreciate what you have.  4. Give more.  5. Expect less  NOW --------  Enough of that crap . . .  The donkey later came back, and bit the shit out of the farmer who had tried to bury him. The gash from the bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in agony from septic shock.  MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON:  When you do something wrong, and try to cover your ass, it always comes back to bite you. Hehehe...

You're seen as vain,       self-centered, and who is extremely dominant.       Others may admire you, wishing they could be more       like you, but don't always trust you, hesitating       to become too deeply involved with you.        51 TO 60 POINTS: Others see you as an exciting,       highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader,       who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones.       They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything       once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure.       They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate.        41 TO 50 POINTS: Others see you as fresh, lively,       charming, amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone       who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently       well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you       as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always       cheer them up and help them out.        31 TO 40 POINTS: Others see you as sensible,       cautious, careful & practical. They see you as clever, gifted,or       talented, but modest. Not a person who makes friends too quickly or       easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and       who expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you       realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it       takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken.        21 TO 30 POINTS: Your friends see you as painstaking       and fussy. They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a       slow and steady plodder. It would really surprise them if you ever       did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment, expecting       you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then,       usually decide against it. They think this reaction is caused partly       by your careful nature.        UNDER 21 POINTS: People think you are shy, nervous,       and indecisive, someone who needs looking after, who       always wants someone else to make the decisions &       who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or       anything. They see you as a worrier who always sees       problems that don't exist. Some people think you're       boring. Only those who know you well know that you aren't.

      The first couple to be shown in bed together on prime time TV were Fred and Wilma Flintstone.  Coca-Cola was originally green.  Men can read smaller print than women can; women can hear better.  The average number of people airborne over the US any given hour: 61,000  Intelligent people have more zinc and copper in their hair.  Each king in a deck of playing cards represents a great King from history: Spades - King David, Hearts - Charlemagne, Clubs -Alexander, the Great Diamonds -Julius Caesar  If a statue in the park of a person on a horse has both front legs in the air, the person died in battle. If the horse has one front leg in the air the person died as a result of wounds received in battle. If the horse has all four legs on the ground, the person died of natural causes.  Q: If you were to spell out numbers, how far would you have to go until you would find the letter "A"?  A: One thousand  Q: What do bullet-proof vests, fire escapes, windshield wipers, and laser printers all have in common?  A: All invented by women.  In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames by ropes. When you pulled on the ropes the mattress tightened, making the bed firmer to sleep on. Hence the phrase "goodnight, sleep tight".  It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago that for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink. Mead is a honey beer and because their calendar was lunar based, this period was called the honey month or what we know today as the honeymoon.  In ancient England a person could not have sex unless you had consent of the King (unless you were in the Royal Family). When anyone wanted to have a baby, they got consent of the King, the King gave them a placard that they hung on their door while they were having sex. The placard had F...U...C...K... (with the other letters in!) Fornication Under Consent of the King" on it. Now you know where that came from.  In Scotland, a new game was invented. It was entitled Gentlemen Only Ladies  Forbidden....Thus the word GOLF entered into the English language

      "Fehhhh!  Menarik  nombor rumah itu," kata Ramey apabila terpandang tulisan No.1, Jalan Tempinis 1/1 ? pada sebuah banglo.  "Haiii!  Ada  juga  manusia  yang percaya nombor macam tu!" kata Zidan yang duduk  di  sebelah. Mereka sama-sama ketawa, sementara Ramey terus memandu. Kedua-dua  sahabat  itu  terus  membisu.  Masing-masing  memikirkan tentang nombor. Betulkah ada nombor membawa tuah dan yang lain tidak?  "Apa  yang  aku  tahu,  orang Cina cukup taksub dengan nombor 8 ? ada 'ong' kata mereka," Ramey memecah kesunyian.  "Tapi  apa  yang  aku dengar, jangan sebut itu pada orang India, ia lambang kematian," balas Zidan. Kedua-duanya serentak terkekeh-kekeh.  Bagaimanapun  seorang  ahli fizik, Prof.Dr. Norhisham Wahab mengaku melalui kajiannya ada nombor yang membawa keburukan dan kebaikan.  "Benar,  nombor  ada  semangat  atau  tenaga semula jadi yang boleh membawa keburukan  atau  kebaikan.  Jadi,  jangan  terkejut kalau ada orang gunakan nombor tertentu untuk menjadikan dirinya bertuah.  "Setiap  orang  dilahirkan bersama nombor yang ada pertalian dengan planet. Kedua-duanya  akan  mempengaruhi  tingkah  laku  seseorang," jelas  Prof.Dr.Norhisham.  Pengasas  rawatan terapi warna di Malaysia ini berpendapat, kalau seseorang tahu   rahsia   satu-satu   nombor  dan  dapat  menggunakan  dengan  betul  insha-Allah dia akan berjaya.   "Tidak  perlu  jumpa  bomoh-bomoh,"  katanya  berseloroh.  Lalu  Prof.  Dr. Norhisham menghuraikan rahsia nombor dan kegunaannya hasil kajiannya itu.      1                                                                     Satu Lambang  keunggulan  Tuhan.  Nombor  kemakmuran,  keutuhan  diri,  kekuatan,   keberanian dan kekuasaan.   Rumah  bernombor  1 akan sentiasa makmur. Tetamu suka datang kerana  suasana yang tenteram, damai dan tenang.   Kalau  orang  yang  bernaung  di bawah nombor ini, dia seorang yang berani. Mempunyai pendirian yang kukuh, memiliki kekuatan fizikal dan mental.      2                                                                       Dua Nombor  ini  bersifat  pasangan  seperti  sejuk  lawannya  panas. Ia simbol pengesahan, penyaksian, perkaitan, syarat menemukan jawapan semula jadi  dan   jodoh.   Menurut  Prof.  Dr.  Norhisham,  bagi  seseorang yang sukar mendapat jodoh, berlindunglah  di  bawah  nombor  ini.  Tidak  perlu jumpa dukun atau mandi dibawah jambatan, cukup sekadar mengingati nombor itu.   Untuk  lebih  mudah,  ambil segelas air sejuk mentah atau air kelapa, lebih elok  air  zam-zam.  Tuliskan  nombor  2 di luar gelas, memadai menggunakan hujung  jari. Kemudian minum, ingat nombor itu dan niatkan dalam hati untuk mendapat pasangan.   "Lakukan tujuh kali atau tujuh hari berturut-turut. Insha-Allah?.tak sampai sebulan pasangan yang sesuai akan diperoleh," tambahnya lagi.   3                                                                      Tiga Rahsia  akal, bijaksana, keceriaan, kesuburan, keseimbangan, pembalasan  dan  penindasan.   Bernaung  di  bawah  nombor  ini  menjadikan  anda  seorang yang pintar dan bijaksana.  Biasanya  apabila  hendak melakukan sesuatu pekerjaan akal akan berkata-kata sama ada ia baik atau buruk.   Boleh  menjadi pencipta yang baik tetapi bermula dengan kemusnahan. Setelah melalui  beberapa  kegagalan baru menikmati kejayaan. Tapi kalau putus asa, habislah.  Mudah  memiliki  sesuatu  kekayaan,  benda,  rumah,  kereta atau apa sahaja tetapi mudah pula melepaskannya.  Pintar  menyelesaikan  setiap  masalah walaupun terlalu rumit. Seorang yang subur,  mempunyai  anak ramai dan ibu bapa yang baik. Paling penting mereka ini awet muda.  4                                  -                                   Empat Nombor  ini membawa simbol rupa bentuk, kesempurnaan, kemantapan kedudukan, kewangan  dan  kehidupan.  Lambang  kekuasaan,  kestabilan  dan lengkap. Ia stabil dan tidak mudah di ganggu-gugat atau dipengaruhi.   Kekuatan   mereka  yang  bernombor  4  ialah  mampu  melihat  melalui  daya imaginasi.  Agakan  mereka selalunya tepat dan kalau merancang, insha-Allah berhasil.  Ramai  arkitek,  jurutera  dan  pereka-pereka  bernaung di bawah nombor ini.  5                                   ?                                   Lima Simbol kreatif, intelek, mampu mempengaruhi, pemikir, bijaksana, pengkritik dan tahap intelekual yang tinggi.   Kalau  menjadi  hakim, dia akan laksanakan tugas dengan bijaksana dan dapat menyelesaikan segala masalah, perbalahan, kerumitan dan kesusahan.   Kekuatannya  adalah  pada  kata-kata. Mampu mempengaruhi orang lain membuat keputusan. Pandai memujuk, merayu supaya pertelingkahan dapat dileraikan.   Jika  anda  tidak  mampu  membuat  keputusan,  ingatkan  5,  nescaya  mudah semuanya.  6                                   ?                                   Enam Hati-hati  dengan  6  jika  anda  lemah  semangat, jangan gunakannya kerana syaitan dan iblis mudah merasuk.   666  adalah  lambang  syaitan  ?  gandaan  kelemahan bagi mereka yang lemah semangat.  Tetapi  6666  pula  adalah  kekuatan  dan kesempurnaan kerana ia adalah bilangan ayat al-Quran.   Kalau  nombor  peribadi  anda 6, anda suka meramal dan boleh meramal dengan tepat. Mulut masin. Suka pada benda ghaib, boleh melihat dan menembusi alam ghaib.   Bagi  yang  belum  kahwin  tetapi sudah mempunyai pasangan atau idaman hati cubalah  ingatkan 6 dan niatkan pada air seperti nombor 2. Percayalah tidak sampai sebulan niat akan terlaksana.   7                                  ?                                   Tujuh Inilah   nombor  paling  baik.  Selain  itu  ia  juga  lambang  pembalasan, memerintah, membangkitkan tenaga dalaman, pelindung, pemusnah dan  penghalau  hantu.   Insha-Allah  doa  mereka  dimakbulkan  jika  mengulangi 7 kali. Mereka juga bersifat  melindungi dan mampu memerintah dengan baik. Nombor ini digunakan untuk menghalau hantu yang meresap di dalam badan.   Caranya  mudah  ? palitkan nombor 7 dengan menggunakan kapur di tempat yang sakit.  Ia  hanya mujarab dilakukan pada malam 13, 14 dan 15 (bulan penuh). Ataupun pelindung ibu yang sedang sakit bersalin daripada dimasuki iblis.   8                                                                     Lapan Orang  Cina cukup suka nombor ini. Kebanyakan mereka sanggup bayar berpuluh ribu  ringgit untuk mendpatkannya ? untuk plat kereta atau rumah. Memanglah nombor  itu mendorong ke arah menjadi semakin kaya tetapi sampai satu tahap jatuh bankrap.   Sebabnya?.   kerana  mereka  tidak  tahu  8  sebenarnya  bermaksud  penamat kehidupan. Bagaimanapun nombor ini memang baik jika tahu rahsianya iaitu ia mendorong  ke  arah  kekayaan,  kemantapan,  kehidupan, keadilan, sempurna, lengkap dan akhirnya kematian.   Jika  anda  tidak  tahu rahsia 8, jangan sesekali cuba menggunakannya. Dari segi  sains  oksigen  terletak  dalam atom 8. Sebab itulah jika tidak cukup oksigen orang akan mati.   9                                 ?                                 Sembilan NOMBOR  ini  lambang  kebenaran.  Kerana itu polis menggunakan 999? Ia juga lambang  tenaga  yang kuat. Sebab itulah ia disimbolkan sebagai perjuangan, kepahlawanan,  peperangan dan pertikaian. Bagaimanapun mereka yang bernaung di  bawahnya mudah terlanjur dalam perbuatan dan percakapan atau suka lepas cakap.   Tapi,  jangan  bimbang?.walaupun  mudah  terlanjur tetapi anda seorang yang cukup  sempurna  dalam hal ilmu keduniaan. Nombor ini boleh digunakan untuk mencari  semula barang yang hilang. Ingat nombor 9, barang yang hilang akan jumpa semula, jika tersalah simpan!   10                                  atau                              0 Sombol  keabdian  Yang  Mencipta,  Maha  Kuasa.  Kebesaran yang tidak dapat diukur dengan apa sekali pun. Tidak ada permulaan dan tidak ada pengakhiran ? tiada penamat. Ia sentiasa akan berlingkar dalam pusingan yang sama tanpa ada titik akhir.  Satu  nombor  yang cukup kuat, tidak mampu dikalahkan oleh segala ilmu yang ada. Tidak ada orang bernung dibawahnya. Hanya Ppencipta memilikinya.  Menurut  Prof.  Dr.  Norhisham,  mengetahui  nombor peribadi penting kerana melaluinya  kita  dapat  mengenal  diri. Hidup akan lebih teratur, sentiasa berwaspada   ketika   membuat  perhitungan  dan  insha-Allah?  tidak  wujud penyesalan.  Kita  tidak  perlu mencari Tok Piah, Kam tukang tilik, minyak cenduai Batin Yat  atau  bertemu  bomoh  fotostat  bagi mencari barang hilang. Anda mampu meramal  masa depan sendiri, menghalau hantu, mencari pasangan dan mendapat kekayaan.  Semuanya  akan  menjadi  nyata  kalau  anda tahu apa rahsia nombor peribadi anda. Nak tahu nombor peribadi? Formula secara ringkasnya: Campurkan tarikh lahir  anda. Misalnya 12-12-1969à 1+2+1+2+1+9+6+9 = 31 ( 3+1=4) Jadi nombor peribadi anda adalah 4.  Tetapi  itu  bukanlah  perkiraan yang tepat. Ia hanya anggarankasar sahaja. Ujian secara rohani diperlukan kerana hanya kita yang tahu rahsia sendiri

A pond in the middle of the desert. C. A sandy beach with crashing waves.    *Results* ============================================== Question 1 shows your attitude toward life  A. If you chose the forest, you're deep, quiet. People find you incredibly interesting because you don't how show your true self right away. Pals love you because you're a good listener.  B. If you chose the cornfield, you're bright, honest and likable. You make friends easily and rarely get bummed. You've got a rep for being entertaining and fun, and you're always the center of attention.  C. If you chose the rolling hills, you're practical and down-to-earth, and you attract people with your straightforward nature. A great problem solver, you always listen to both points of view before taking a side.    Question 2 reveals what kind of boyfriend/girlfriend you're looking for  A. If you chose the mirror, you're searching for a guy/gal who shares your outlook on life. You've got a pretty good idea of what your ideal boyfriend/girlfriend is like, but you keep an open mind - the perfect guy may be someone you normally wouldn't look at twice!  B. If you chose the ring, you are a true romantic. When in a relationship, you work hard at keeping things mushy. You believe true love is forever, and although you might not admit it, you want your guy/gal care about you.  C. If you chose the bottle, you want someone who's not afraid to show his intelligence. Ambitious, hard-working guys/gals turn you on drop- dead gorgeous just isn't enough for you.    Question 3 tells how commitment-ready you are  A. If you said yes, you're dying to pick the right person.  B. If you said no, you're into playing the field for now.    Question 4 symbolizes your passion potential  A. If you chose the lake, you're not interested in having a superficial relationship. Once you meet someone you're really into, your love runs deep.  B. If you chose the waterfall, opposite sex think you're ultrasexy. You're good at turning on the charm, and loads of guys/gals lust after you.  C. If you chose the brook, you're always crushing on someone new. You're an expert flirt, and you're frequently on the move from one guy to the next.    Question 5 expresses your views on school  A. If you saw the housekey, education is less important to you than the world beyond. Secretly, you may be dying to start a career and a home of your own.  B. If you saw the antique key, you consider education to be crucial. You want to work hard and want to absorb as much knowledge as you possibly can.  C. If you saw the padlock key, you may not be too into school,but you still have plenty of great ideas. You follow your intuition, so you may eventually end up in an offbeat career.    Question 6 gives clues about your ambitions  A. If you chose the mansion, you've got tons of goals. You strive to be the best at whatever you do, and you're attracted to jobs that let you express your energetic personality. Being successful makes you superpsyched.  B. If you chose the cottage, you have a realistic attitude toward a future profession. Because your feet are planted firmly on the ground, you'll probably rock at whatever career you pick.  C. If you chose the castle, your career dreams could be a little unrealistic. Becoming a mega-star would be fab, but aim for something closer to home first. Otherwise, you may wind up being a little disappointed.    Question 7 shows your attitude towards success  A. If you looked through the window, you're a little afraid of failing. Taking that first step toward reaching a goal is the most intimidating to you, so don't give up before you've actually tried.  B. If you went inside, you feel confident about success. Nothing's going to stand in your way!  C. If you kept walking, success isn't a big deal for you. You're content with simple things and you'd rather be around people you love than spend your life trying to get to the top.    Question 8 reveals your worst fears  A. If you chose the bear, you worry about being able to stand on your own two feet. Independence is totally key.  B. If you chose the wizard, you're scared about things that are often beyond your control. So, to make up for it, you sometimes go on a heavy-duty power amperage.  C. If you chose the troll, you tend to obsess over how others see you. It's crucial that people like you - you're desperate to fit into the in crowd. You need to learn to trust your own judgment.    Question 9 represents your innermost self  A. If you chose the gardens, you're mature and honest. You believe in speaking your mind, and people rely on you to provide a sensible viewpoint. However, you may come across problems in the future that you'll have to solve with your heart, not your head.  B. If you chose the desert pond, you have a deep need for your own space. You're always analyzing your thoughts, and you've been known to do a disappearing act when things get tough. Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help you feel better.  C. If you chose the beach, you are passionate about life and have strong opinions that you aren't afraid to reveal. But you're unpredictable, and you change those opinions often. Sometimes, like the ocean, you'll show your calmer side-but usually not for long!

      A group of children were playing near two railway tracks, one still in use while the other disused. Only one child played on the disused track, the rest on the operational track.   The train came, and you were just beside the track interchange. You could make the train change its course to the disused track and saved most of the kids. However, that would also mean the lone child playing by the disused track would be sacrificed. Or would you rather let the train go its way?  Let's take a pause to think what kind of decision we could make.   Most people might choose to divert the course of the train, and sacrifice only one child. You might think the same way, I guess. Exactly, I thought the same way initially because to save most of the children at the expense of only one child was rational decision most people would make, morally and emotionally. But, have you ever thought that the child choosing to play on the disused track had in fact made the right decision to play at a safe place?  Nevertheless, he had to be sacrificed because of his ignorant friends who chose to play where the danger was. This kind of dilemma happens around us everyday. In the office, community, in politics and especially in a democratic society, the minority is often sacrificed for the interest of the majority, no matter how foolish or ignorant the majority are, and how farsighted and knowledgeable the minority are. The child who chose not to play with the rest on the operational track was sidelined. And in the case he was sacrificed, no one would shed a tear for him.   The friend who forwarded me the story said he would not try to change the course of the train because he believed that the kids playing on the operational track should have known very well that track was still in use, and that they should have run away if they heard the train's sirens.   If the train was diverted, that lone child would definitely die because he never thought the train could come over to that track! Moreover, that track was not in use probably because it was not safe. If the train was diverted to the track, we could put the lives of all passengers on board at stake! And in your attempt to save a few kids by sacrificing one child, you might end up sacrificing hundreds of people to save these few kids. While we are all aware that life is full of tough decisions that need to be made, we may not realize that hasty decisions may not always be the right one.  "Remember that what's right isn't always popular... and what's popular isn't always right."

      Study: Fellatio may significantly decrease the risk of breast cancer in women Thursday, October 2, 2003 Posted: 9:19 AM EDT (1319 GMT)  RELATED * New England Journal of Medicine * American Cancer Society  HEALTH LIBRARY * Health Library * Fellatio * Breast Cancer * 6 steps to  cancer prevention  (AP) -- Women who perform the act of fellatio and swallow semen on a regular basis, one to two times a week, may reduce their risk of breast cancer by up to 40 percent, a North Carolina State University study found.  Doctors had never suspected a link between the act of fellatio and breast cancer, but new research being performed at North Carolina State University is starting to suggest that there could be an important link between the two.  In a study of over 15,000 women suspected of having performed regular fellatio and swallowed the ejaculatory fluid, over the past ten years, the researchers found that those actually having performed the act regularly, one to two times a week, had a lower occurance of breast cancer than those who had not. There was no increased risk, however, for those who did not regularly perform.  "I think it removes the last shade of doubt that fellatio is actually a healthy act," said Dr. A.J. Kramer of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. "I am surprised by these findings, but am also excited that the researchers may have discovered a relatively easy way to lower the occurance of breast cancer in women." The University researchers stressed that, though breast cancer is relatively uncommon, any steps taken to reduce the risk would be a wise decision.  "Only with regular occurance will your chances be reduced, so I encourage all women out there to make fellatio an important part of their daily routine," said Dr. Helena Shifteer, one of the researchers at the University. "Since the emergence of the research, I try to fellate at least once every other night to reduce my chances."  The study is reported in Friday's Journal of Medical Research. In 1991, 43,582 women died of breast cancer, as reported by the National Cancer Institute.  Dr. Len Lictepeen, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said women should not overlook or "play down" these findings.  "This will hopefully change women's practice and patterns, resulting in a severe drop in the future number of cases," Lictepeen said. Sooner said the research shows no increase in the risk of breast cancer in those who are, for whatever reason, not able to fellate regularly. "There's definitely fertile ground for more research. Many have stepped forward to volunteer for related research now in the planning stages," he said.  Almost every woman is, at some point, going to perform the act of fellatio, but it is the frequency at which this event occurs that makes the difference, say researchers. Also key seems to be the protein and enzyme count in the semen, but researchers are again waiting for more test data.  The reasearch consisted of two groups, 6,246 women ages 25 to 45 who had performed fellatio and swallowed on a regular basis over the past five to ten years, and 9,728 women who had not or did not swallow. The group of women who had performed and swallowed had a breast cancer rate of 1.9 percent and the group who had not had a breast cancer rate of 10.4 percent.  "The findings do suggest that there are other causes for breast cancer besides the absence of regular fellatio," Shafteer said. "It's a cause, not THE cause."

      Look what happens when a President gets elected in a year with a "0" at the end.   Also notice it goes in increments of 20 years.  1840: William Henry Harrison (died in office) 1860: Abraham Lincoln (assassinated) 1880: James A. Garfield (assassinated) 1900: William McKinley (assassinated) 1920: Warren G. Harding (died in office) 1940: Franklin D. Roosevelt (dies in office) 1960: John F. Kennedy (assassinated) 1980: Ronald Reagan (survived assassination attempt) 2000: George W. Bush ????????????  And to think that we had two guys fighting it out in the courts to be the one elected in 2000.  You might also be interested in this.  Have a history teacher explain this----- if they can.  Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846. John F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946.  Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860. John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960.  Both were particularly concerned with civil rights. Both wives lost their children while living in the White House.  Both Presidents were shot on a Friday. Both Presidents were shot in the head.  Now it gets really weird.  Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy. Kennedy's Secretary was named Lincoln.  Both were assassinated by Southerners. Both were succeeded by Southerners named Johnson.  Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was born in 1808. Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908.  John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, was born in 1839. Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy, was born in 1939.  Both assassins were known by their three names. Both names are composed of fifteen letters.  Now hang on to your seat.  Lincoln was shot at the theater named 'Ford.' Kennedy was shot in a car called 'Lincoln' made by 'Ford.'  Lincoln was shot in a theater and his assassin ran and hid in a warehouse. Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and his assassin ran and hid in a theater.  Booth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials.  And here's the kicker.......  A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe, Maryland  A week before Kennedy was shot, he was with Marilyn Monroe..

         The British submarine engineer and historian Gavin Menzies gave an astounding seminar on March 15, 2002 to the Royal Geographical Society in London, with evidence to support his theory that Zheng He, a Chinese Muslim navigator in the Ming dynasty, beat Columbus by more than 70 years in discovering America.  Using evidence from maps drawn dated before Columbus' trip that clearly showed America, and astronomical maps traced back to Zheng He's time, Menzies is confident that the Zheng He should be honored as the first discoverer of America.  Menzies's conclusion is based on 14 years of research that includes secret maps, evidence of artifacts, and apparent proof of the voyage provided by the modern astronomy software program Starry Night.  As key evidence for a voyage that will remake history, Menzies says he obtained ancient Chinese navigation charts associated with the travels of Zheng He. The journey ran from 1421 to 1423. Menzies maintains that the ships sailed around the Southern tips of both Africa and South America.   The late evening southern sky as it would have looked on March 18, 1421, from off the southern tip of South America. Reconstructed with Starry Night Software to compare with maps found from Zheng He's voyages.  "I set Starry Night up for dates in 1421 for parts of the world where I thought the Chinese had sailed," explained Menzies, a navigation expert and former Royal Navy submarine commander. He found that in two separate locations of the voyage, easily recognizable stars were directly above Zheng He's fleet.  Those stars have since moved, due to changes in Earth's orientation in space. Earth's spin is slightly imperfect, and its axis carves a circle on the sky every 26,000 years. The phenomenon, called precession, means that each pole points to different stars as time progresses. Menzies used the software program to recreate the sky as it would have looked in 1421.  "I had Chinese star charts, and I needed to date the charts," he said. "By an incredible bit of luck, one of the courses they steered, between Sumatra and Dondra Head, Ceylon, was due west."  This part of the journey was very near the equator in the Indian Ocean. Both Polaris, the North Star, and the bright southern star Canopus, which was very nearly above the celestial south pole, were on the charts. "From that I was able to determine the apparent shift of Polaris (due to precession). I could therefore date the chart to 1421, plus or minus 30 years."  Phillip Sadler, a celestial navigation expert at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, says the estimation of a map's age based on star positions is possible. He said an estimate within 30 years, as Menzies claims, is possible.  About Zheng He:  Zheng He (1371-1435), or Cheng Ho, is China's most famous navigator. He built a total of 1622 ships and made at least seven major excursions between 1405 AD and 1430 AD. He traveled more than 50,000km and visited over 30 countries, reaching Somalia and probably Europe (France, Holland and Portugal).  Zheng He constructed many wooden ships, some of which are the largest in the history, in Nanjing. Three of the shipyards still exist today.  In each trip, he led a troop of 27,800 people on more than 300 ships. In each trip, 62 major ships of this fleet were employed, each over 400 ft long and 193 ft wide, holding 1000 people per ship, dwarfing Columbus' Santa Maria (75 ft x 25 ft) more than six-fold.  In the 1930s, a stone pillar was discovered in a town in Fujian province. It held an inscription that described the amazing voyages of Zheng He.  Zheng He described how the emperor of the Ming Dynasty had ordered him to sail to "the countries beyond the horizon," all the way to the end of the earth." His mission was to display the might of Chinese.  The pillar contains the Chinese names for the countries Zheng He visited. He wrote:  We have...beheld in the ocean huge waves like mountains rising sky-high, and we have set eyes on barbarian regions far away hidden in a blue transparency of light vapors, while our sails, loftily unfurled like clouds, day and night continued their course rapid like that of a star, transversing the savage waves as if we were treading a public thoroughfare.  The countries and territories covered and recorded in the official Ming history includes Java, Sumatra, Vietnam, Siam, Cambodia, Philippines, Ceylon, Bangladesh, India, Yemen, Arabia, Somalia, Mogadishu. As a clear demonstration of his travel to Africa, among the souvenirs he brought back to China were the giraffes and lions, indigenous animals of Africa.  The official history also mentioned "Franca" (which was the territory to describe today's France and Portugal) and Holland. The Hollanders were described as tall people with red hair and beard, long nose, and deep eye sockets. If he did meet with the Europeans in their native countries, then the only way would be to navigate around the Cape of Good Hope before the Suez Canal was a throughway.  Unfortunately, Zheng He's magnificent accomplishment was later targeted by other courtiers as wasteful. Most of his records were destroyed and building of ships with more than three masts were considered crimes punishable by death. So, a large part of his excursion (which might include the America part) has no reports.  In Africa near Kenya today, there are tribes that are clearly Asian-looking. They also consider themselves as the descendants of Zheng He's crew.  His achievements show that China had the ships and navigational skills to explore the world. Mysteriously, China did not follow up on these voyages. The Chinese destroyed their ocean going ships and halted further expeditions. Thus, a century later, Europeans would "discover" China, instead of the Chinese "discovering" Europe.  China has a very old seafaring tradition. Chinese ships had sailed to India as early as the Han Dynasty. Chinese sailors had an important invention to help them-the compass. The compass, or "south pointing spoon," started out as a fortune-telling instrument used like an Ouija board. By the Song era, sailors had taken it up. As a foreign ship captain wrote, "In dark, weather they look to the south pointing needle, and use a sounding line to determine the smell and nature of the mud on the sea bottom, and so know where they are.  Chinese shipbuilders also developed fore-and-aft sails, the sternpost rudder, and boats with paddlewheels. Watertight compartments below decks kept the ship from sinking. Some boats were armor plated for protection. All these developments made long distance navigation possible.  After the Mongols were overthrown in 1368, the emperor of the new Ming Dynasty wanted to assert Chinese power. Because China was no longer part of a land empire that stretched from Asia to Europe, the emperor turned to the sea. He decided to build a navy. The Chinese made elaborate plans that would not be fulfilled for many years. A shipyard was built at the new capital of Najing (Nanking). Thousand of varnish and tung trees were planted on nearby Purple Mountain to provide wood for shipbuilding. The emperor established a school of foreign languages to train interpreters. While all this was going on, the man who would lead the navy was still an infant.   China's greatest adventurer, the 15th century Muslim, Admiral  Zheng He  Zheng He was born in 1371 in Kunyang, a town in southwest Yunnan Province. His family, named Ma, were part of a minority group known as the Semur. They originally came from Central Asia and followed the religion of Islam. Both his grandfather and father had made the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. Zheng He grew up hearing their accounts of travel through foreign lands.  Yunnan was one of the last strongholds of Mongol support, holding out long after the Ming Dynasty began. After Ming armies conquered Yunnan in 1382, Zheng He was taken captive and brought to Nanjing. The eleven year old boy was made a servant of the prince who would become the Yong Le Emperor. It was Yong Le who renamed the boy Zheng He.  Zheng He is described in Chinese historical records as tall and heavy, with "clear-cut features and long ear lobes; a stride like a tiger's and voice clear and vibrant." He was well liked and admired for his quick wit in argument. Moreover, he was a brave soldier. When his prince seized the Chinese throne from his nephew, Zheng He fought well on his behalf. As a result, Zheng He became a close confidant of the new emperor and was given an important position at court.  The Yong Le emperor had ambitious plans. A vigorous man, he rebuilt the Great Wall to the condition in which it exists today. He also built his new capital at Beijing, next to the remains of the former Yuan capital. The emperor decided to go ahead with the sea voyages that had long been planned. He appointed Zheng He to lead them and gave him the title "Admiral of the Western Seas."  At each country Zheng He visited, he was to present gifts from the emperor and to exact tribute for the glory of the Ming. The Chinese had a unique view of foreign relations. Because China developed its culture in isolation from other great civilization, it says itself as the center of the world. The Chinese called their country "the Middle Kingdom."  The Chinese emperor's duty was to attract "all under heaven" to be civilized in Confucian harmony. When foreign ambassadors came to the Chinese court, they "kowtowed" as they approached the emperor. (The required process of "kowtow" was to kneel three times and bow one's head to the floor three times at each kneeling.) In return for tribute from other countries, the emperor sent gifts and special seals that confirmed their rulers' authority. In fact, these foreign kings were officially made part of the Ming Dynasty.  In 1405 Zheng He set out on his first voyage. No nation on earth had ever sent such a fleet onto the ocean. It included sixty-two large ships, some 600 feet long, larger than any other on the seas. Hundreds of smaller vessels accompanied them. A Chinese historian described them; "The ships which sail the Southern Sea are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky."  Zheng He's first port of call was in Champa, a part of today's Vietnam. He was surprised to find many Chinese living there. Merchants and craftsmen had emigrated from the coastal provinces since the time of the Tang Dynasty. They had already helped to spread Confucian ideals, and Champs's ruler willingly offered tribute for the Chinese emperor. In return, of course, Zheng He presented the king with lavish gifts that were probably more valuable.  Zheng He sailed away from the coast, westward across the Indian Ocean. The ships traveled for days out of sight of any land. Then they encountered a hurricane. The ships tossed wildly in the fierce storm and seemed to be on the verge of sinking. Then a "divine light" suddenly shone at the tips of the mast. "As soon as this miraculous light appeared, the danger was appeased," Zheng He wrote.   When the Chinese sailors reached Calicut, India, their giant ships created a stir. The ruler there presented his visitors with sashes made of gold spun into hair-fine threads and studded with large pearls and precious stones. The Chinese were entertained with music and songs. One crewmember wrote that the Indians' musical instruments were "made of gourds with strings of red copper wire, and the sound and rhythm were pleasant to the ears."  On the way back to China, the fleet threaded its way through the Straits of Malacca, stopping at the large islands of Sumatra and Java. Zheng He established a base at the Straits that he would use for each of his seven voyages. There are thousands of smaller islands in this vast archipelago, and some were pirates' lairs. The pirates preyed on unwary fishermen and small merchant vessels. Zheng He, showing how the emperor treated those who disrupted harmony, attacked and destroyed a fleet of pirate ships. He captured the leader and brought him back to Beijing for execution.   When Zheng He returned, the emperor was pleased. He sent his admiral on ever-longer voyages. Seven times, Zheng He's ships set sail for unknown lands. On and on he went, following his orders to travel as far as he could. He reached Arabia, where he fulfilled a personal dream. He made the pilgrimage to Mecca that is the duty of every good Muslim once in his lifetime. He also visited Prophet Muhammad Mosque in Medina. On the fifth voyage, he reached the coast of Africa, landing in Somalia on the east coast.  Zheng He organized each expedition on an enormous scale. Besides sailors and navigators, they included doctors, scribes, shipwrights, and cooks. On some voyages Muslim religious leaders and Buddhist monks were brought along to serve as diplomats in lands where people were Muslim or Buddhist.  Each ship brought enough food to last the whole voyage, in case "barbarian" food was not acceptable. In addition to rice and other food that could be preserved, the ships carried huge tubs of earth on deck so that vegetables and fruit could be grown.  On each voyage the fleet anchored at the Malacca base, where provisions, tribute, and gifts were stored in warehouses. Zheng He found that foreign kings and princes particularly admired the famous blue-and-white Ming porcelain dishes, vases, and cups. Foreigners still yearned for Chinese silk, for cotton printed with Chinese designs, and for the coarse but long lasting, brownish yellow cloth known as Nankeen because it was made in Nanking (now Nanjing). The holds of Zheng He's ships were also crammed with gold and silver, iron tools, copper kitchenware, and perfumes.  In exchange for such wares, and as tribute, Zheng He brought back medicinal herbs, dyes, spices, precious, gems, pearls, rhinoceros horns, ivory, and exotic animals. On the homeward voyage, the fleet again stopped at their base to sort out the foreign goods and wait for a favorable wind to return to China.  The expeditions were an important source of information about foreign countries. A crewmember described the Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal off the east coast of India:  Its inhabitants live in the hollows of trees and caves. Both men and women there go about stark naked, like wild beasts, without a stitch of clothing on them. No rice grows there. The people subsist solely on wild yams, jackfruit and plantains, or upon the fish which they catch. There is a legend current among them that, if they wear the smallest scrap of clothing, their bodies would break into sores and ulcers, owing to their ancestors having been cursed by Buddha for having stolen and hidden his clothes while he was bathing.  In Sri Lanka, the Chinese visited Buddhist Temple Hill, where Buddha was said to have left his footprint on a rock. They marveled at all the temples, particularly one that held a relic of the Buddha's tooth. According to a crew member, the people of the island do not venture to eat cow's flesh, they merely drink the milk. When a cow dies they bury it. It is capital punishment for anyone to secretly kill a cow; he who does so can however escape punishment by paying a ransom of a cow's head made of solid gold.  Sri Lanka seemed like a treasure island, where rubies and other precious stones were abundant. The people harvested pearls from the sea and had discovered the trick of making cultured pearls by planting a speck of sand inside an oyster's shell.  The king of Sri Lanka was an ardent Buddhist who treated both cows and elephants with religious respect. However, because he did not show proper respect for the ambassadors from the Son of Heaven, he was taken back to China for "instruction." He was returned to his island on a later voyage.  When the Chinese reached the east coast of Africa, they found people who built houses of brick. "Men and women wear their hair in rolls; when they go out they wear a linen hood. There are deep wells worked by means of cog wheels. Fish are caught in the sea with nets." The Africans offered such goods a "dragon saliva, incense, and golden amber." The Chinese found the African animals even more amazing. There included "lion, gold-spotted leopards, and camel-birds (ostriches), which are six or seven feet tall." The most exciting thing that Zheng He ever brought back to the emperor's count was a giraffe.  The animal came from today's Somalia. In the Somali Language, the name for giraffe sounds similar to the Chinese word for unicorn. It was easy to imagine that this was the legendary animal that had played an important part in the birth of Confucius. Surely, it must be a sign of Heaven's favor on the emperor's reign.   When the giraffe arrived in 1415, the emperor himself went to the palace gate to receive it, as well as a "celestial horse" (zebra) and a "celestial stag" (oryx). The palace officials offered congratulations and performed the kowtow before the heavenly animals.  When Zheng He came back from his seventh voyage in 1433, he was sixty-two years old. He had accomplished much for China, spreading the glory of the Middle Kingdom to many countries that now sent tribute and ambassadors to the court. Though he died soon afterward, his exploits had won him fame. Plays and novels were written about his voyages. In such places as Malacca and Java, towns, caves, and temples were named after him.  However, a new Ming emperor had come to the throne. His scholar-officials criticized Zheng's achievements, complaining about their great expense. China was now fighting another barbarian enemy on its western borders and needed to devote its resources to that struggle. When a court favorite wanted to continue Zheng He's voyages, he was turned down. To make sure, the court officials destroyed the logs that Zheng He had kept. We know about his voyages only from the pillar and some accounts that his crewmembers wrote.  Thus, China abandoned its overseas voyages. It was a fateful decision, for just at that time, Portugal was beginning to send its ships down the west coast of Africa. In the centuries that followed, European explorers would sail to all parts of the world. They would establish colonies in Africa, America, and finally in the nations of East Asia. China would suffer because it had turned its back on exploration. Zheng He had started the process that might have led the Middle Kingdom to greater glory Unfortunately the rulers of the Ming Dynasty refused to follow his lead.  Zheng He died in the tenth year of the reign of the Ming emperor Xuande (1435) and was buried in the southern outskirts of Bull's Head Hill (Niushou) in Nanjing.  In 1985, during the 580th anniversary of Zheng He's voyage, his tomb was restored. The new tomb was built on the site of the original tomb in Nanjing and reconstructed according to the customs of Islamic teachings, as Zheng He was a Muslim.  At the entrance to the tomb is a Ming-style structure, which houses the memorial hall. Inside are paintings of the man himself and his navigation maps. To get to the tomb, there are newly laid stone platforms and steps. The stairway consists of 28 stone steps divided into four sections with each section having seven steps. This represents Zheng He's seven journeys to the West. The Arabic words "Allah (God) is great" are inscribed on top of the tomb.

He said an estimate within 30 years, as Menzies claims, is possible.  About Zheng He:  Zheng He (1371-1435), or Cheng Ho, is China's most famous navigator. He built a total of 1622 ships and made at least seven major excursions between 1405 AD and 1430 AD. He traveled more than 50,000km and visited over 30 countries, reaching Somalia and probably Europe (France, Holland and Portugal).  Zheng He constructed many wooden ships, some of which are the largest in the history, in Nanjing. Three of the shipyards still exist today.  In each trip, he led a troop of 27,800 people on more than 300 ships. In each trip, 62 major ships of this fleet were employed, each over 400 ft long and 193 ft wide, holding 1000 people per ship, dwarfing Columbus' Santa Maria (75 ft x 25 ft) more than six-fold.  In the 1930s, a stone pillar was discovered in a town in Fujian province. It held an inscription that described the amazing voyages of Zheng He.  Zheng He described how the emperor of the Ming Dynasty had ordered him to sail to "the countries beyond the horizon," all the way to the end of the earth." His mission was to display the might of Chinese.  The pillar contains the Chinese names for the countries Zheng He visited. He wrote:  We have...beheld in the ocean huge waves like mountains rising sky-high, and we have set eyes on barbarian regions far away hidden in a blue transparency of light vapors, while our sails, loftily unfurled like clouds, day and night continued their course rapid like that of a star, transversing the savage waves as if we were treading a public thoroughfare.  The countries and territories covered and recorded in the official Ming history includes Java, Sumatra, Vietnam, Siam, Cambodia, Philippines, Ceylon, Bangladesh, India, Yemen, Arabia, Somalia, Mogadishu. As a clear demonstration of his travel to Africa, among the souvenirs he brought back to China were the giraffes and lions, indigenous animals of Africa.  The official history also mentioned "Franca" (which was the territory to describe today's France and Portugal) and Holland. The Hollanders were described as tall people with red hair and beard, long nose, and deep eye sockets. If he did meet with the Europeans in their native countries, then the only way would be to navigate around the Cape of Good Hope before the Suez Canal was a throughway.  Unfortunately, Zheng He's magnificent accomplishment was later targeted by other courtiers as wasteful. Most of his records were destroyed and building of ships with more than three masts were considered crimes punishable by death. So, a large part of his excursion (which might include the America part) has no reports.  In Africa near Kenya today, there are tribes that are clearly Asian-looking. They also consider themselves as the descendants of Zheng He's crew.  His achievements show that China had the ships and navigational skills to explore the world. Mysteriously, China did not follow up on these voyages. The Chinese destroyed their ocean going ships and halted further expeditions. Thus, a century later, Europeans would "discover" China, instead of the Chinese "discovering" Europe.  China has a very old seafaring tradition. Chinese ships had sailed to India as early as the Han Dynasty. Chinese sailors had an important invention to help them-the compass. The compass, or "south pointing spoon," started out as a fortune-telling instrument used like an Ouija board. By the Song era, sailors had taken it up. As a foreign ship captain wrote, "In dark, weather they look to the south pointing needle, and use a sounding line to determine the smell and nature of the mud on the sea bottom, and so know where they are.  Chinese shipbuilders also developed fore-and-aft sails, the sternpost rudder, and boats with paddlewheels. Watertight compartments below decks kept the ship from sinking. Some boats were armor plated for protection. All these developments made long distance navigation possible.  After the Mongols were overthrown in 1368, the emperor of the new Ming Dynasty wanted to assert Chinese power. Because China was no longer part of a land empire that stretched from Asia to Europe, the emperor turned to the sea. He decided to build a navy. The Chinese made elaborate plans that would not be fulfilled for many years. A shipyard was built at the new capital of Najing (Nanking). Thousand of varnish and tung trees were planted on nearby Purple Mountain to provide wood for shipbuilding. The emperor established a school of foreign languages to train interpreters. While all this was going on, the man who would lead the navy was still an infant.   China's greatest adventurer, the 15th century Muslim, Admiral  Zheng He  Zheng He was born in 1371 in Kunyang, a town in southwest Yunnan Province. His family, named Ma, were part of a minority group known as the Semur. They originally came from Central Asia and followed the religion of Islam. Both his grandfather and father had made the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. Zheng He grew up hearing their accounts of travel through foreign lands.  Yunnan was one of the last strongholds of Mongol support, holding out long after the Ming Dynasty began. After Ming armies conquered Yunnan in 1382, Zheng He was taken captive and brought to Nanjing. The eleven year old boy was made a servant of the prince who would become the Yong Le Emperor. It was Yong Le who renamed the boy Zheng He.  Zheng He is described in Chinese historical records as tall and heavy, with "clear-cut features and long ear lobes; a stride like a tiger's and voice clear and vibrant." He was well liked and admired for his quick wit in argument. Moreover, he was a brave soldier. When his prince seized the Chinese throne from his nephew, Zheng He fought well on his behalf. As a result, Zheng He became a close confidant of the new emperor and was given an important position at court.  The Yong Le emperor had ambitious plans. A vigorous man, he rebuilt the Great Wall to the condition in which it exists today. He also built his new capital at Beijing, next to the remains of the former Yuan capital. The emperor decided to go ahead with the sea voyages that had long been planned. He appointed Zheng He to lead them and gave him the title "Admiral of the Western Seas."  At each country Zheng He visited, he was to present gifts from the emperor and to exact tribute for the glory of the Ming. The Chinese had a unique view of foreign relations. Because China developed its culture in isolation from other great civilization, it says itself as the center of the world. The Chinese called their country "the Middle Kingdom."  The Chinese emperor's duty was to attract "all under heaven" to be civilized in Confucian harmony. When foreign ambassadors came to the Chinese court, they "kowtowed" as they approached the emperor. (The required process of "kowtow" was to kneel three times and bow one's head to the floor three times at each kneeling.) In return for tribute from other countries, the emperor sent gifts and special seals that confirmed their rulers' authority. In fact, these foreign kings were officially made part of the Ming Dynasty.  In 1405 Zheng He set out on his first voyage. No nation on earth had ever sent such a fleet onto the ocean. It included sixty-two large ships, some 600 feet long, larger than any other on the seas. Hundreds of smaller vessels accompanied them. A Chinese historian described them; "The ships which sail the Southern Sea are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky."  Zheng He's first port of call was in Champa, a part of today's Vietnam. He was surprised to find many Chinese living there. Merchants and craftsmen had emigrated from the coastal provinces since the time of the Tang Dynasty. They had already helped to spread Confucian ideals, and Champs's ruler willingly offered tribute for the Chinese emperor. In return, of course, Zheng He presented the king with lavish gifts that were probably more valuable.  Zheng He sailed away from the coast, westward across the Indian Ocean. The ships traveled for days out of sight of any land. Then they encountered a hurricane. The ships tossed wildly in the fierce storm and seemed to be on the verge of sinking. Then a "divine light" suddenly shone at the tips of the mast. "As soon as this miraculous light appeared, the danger was appeased," Zheng He wrote.   When the Chinese sailors reached Calicut, India, their giant ships created a stir. The ruler there presented his visitors with sashes made of gold spun into hair-fine threads and studded with large pearls and precious stones. The Chinese were entertained with music and songs. One crewmember wrote that the Indians' musical instruments were "made of gourds with strings of red copper wire, and the sound and rhythm were pleasant to the ears."  On the way back to China, the fleet threaded its way through the Straits of Malacca, stopping at the large islands of Sumatra and Java. Zheng He established a base at the Straits that he would use for each of his seven voyages. There are thousands of smaller islands in this vast archipelago, and some were pirates' lairs. The pirates preyed on unwary fishermen and small merchant vessels. Zheng He, showing how the emperor treated those who disrupted harmony, attacked and destroyed a fleet of pirate ships. He captured the leader and brought him back to Beijing for execution.   When Zheng He returned, the emperor was pleased. He sent his admiral on ever-longer voyages. Seven times, Zheng He's ships set sail for unknown lands. On and on he went, following his orders to travel as far as he could. He reached Arabia, where he fulfilled a personal dream. He made the pilgrimage to Mecca that is the duty of every good Muslim once in his lifetime. He also visited Prophet Muhammad Mosque in Medina. On the fifth voyage, he reached the coast of Africa, landing in Somalia on the east coast.  Zheng He organized each expedition on an enormous scale. Besides sailors and navigators, they included doctors, scribes, shipwrights, and cooks. On some voyages Muslim religious leaders and Buddhist monks were brought along to serve as diplomats in lands where people were Muslim or Buddhist.  Each ship brought enough food to last the whole voyage, in case "barbarian" food was not acceptable. In addition to rice and other food that could be preserved, the ships carried huge tubs of earth on deck so that vegetables and fruit could be grown.  On each voyage the fleet anchored at the Malacca base, where provisions, tribute, and gifts were stored in warehouses. Zheng He found that foreign kings and princes particularly admired the famous blue-and-white Ming porcelain dishes, vases, and cups. Foreigners still yearned for Chinese silk, for cotton printed with Chinese designs, and for the coarse but long lasting, brownish yellow cloth known as Nankeen because it was made in Nanking (now Nanjing). The holds of Zheng He's ships were also crammed with gold and silver, iron tools, copper kitchenware, and perfumes.  In exchange for such wares, and as tribute, Zheng He brought back medicinal herbs, dyes, spices, precious, gems, pearls, rhinoceros horns, ivory, and exotic animals. On the homeward voyage, the fleet again stopped at their base to sort out the foreign goods and wait for a favorable wind to return to China.  The expeditions were an important source of information about foreign countries. A crewmember described the Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal off the east coast of India:  Its inhabitants live in the hollows of trees and caves. Both men and women there go about stark naked, like wild beasts, without a stitch of clothing on them. No rice grows there. The people subsist solely on wild yams, jackfruit and plantains, or upon the fish which they catch. There is a legend current among them that, if they wear the smallest scrap of clothing, their bodies would break into sores and ulcers, owing to their ancestors having been cursed by Buddha for having stolen and hidden his clothes while he was bathing.  In Sri Lanka, the Chinese visited Buddhist Temple Hill, where Buddha was said to have left his footprint on a rock. They marveled at all the temples, particularly one that held a relic of the Buddha's tooth. According to a crew member, the people of the island do not venture to eat cow's flesh, they merely drink the milk. When a cow dies they bury it. It is capital punishment for anyone to secretly kill a cow; he who does so can however escape punishment by paying a ransom of a cow's head made of solid gold.  Sri Lanka seemed like a treasure island, where rubies and other precious stones were abundant. The people harvested pearls from the sea and had discovered the trick of making cultured pearls by planting a speck of sand inside an oyster's shell.  The king of Sri Lanka was an ardent Buddhist who treated both cows and elephants with religious respect. However, because he did not show proper respect for the ambassadors from the Son of Heaven, he was taken back to China for "instruction." He was returned to his island on a later voyage.  When the Chinese reached the east coast of Africa, they found people who built houses of brick. "Men and women wear their hair in rolls; when they go out they wear a linen hood. There are deep wells worked by means of cog wheels. Fish are caught in the sea with nets." The Africans offered such goods a "dragon saliva, incense, and golden amber." The Chinese found the African animals even more amazing. There included "lion, gold-spotted leopards, and camel-birds (ostriches), which are six or seven feet tall." The most exciting thing that Zheng He ever brought back to the emperor's count was a giraffe.  The animal came from today's Somalia. In the Somali Language, the name for giraffe sounds similar to the Chinese word for unicorn. It was easy to imagine that this was the legendary animal that had played an important part in the birth of Confucius. Surely, it must be a sign of Heaven's favor on the emperor's reign.   When the giraffe arrived in 1415, the emperor himself went to the palace gate to receive it, as well as a "celestial horse" (zebra) and a "celestial stag" (oryx). The palace officials offered congratulations and performed the kowtow before the heavenly animals.  When Zheng He came back from his seventh voyage in 1433, he was sixty-two years old. He had accomplished much for China, spreading the glory of the Middle Kingdom to many countries that now sent tribute and ambassadors to the court. Though he died soon afterward, his exploits had won him fame. Plays and novels were written about his voyages. In such places as Malacca and Java, towns, caves, and temples were named after him.  However, a new Ming emperor had come to the throne. His scholar-officials criticized Zheng's achievements, complaining about their great expense. China was now fighting another barbarian enemy on its western borders and needed to devote its resources to that struggle. When a court favorite wanted to continue Zheng He's voyages, he was turned down. To make sure, the court officials destroyed the logs that Zheng He had kept. We know about his voyages only from the pillar and some accounts that his crewmembers wrote.  Thus, China abandoned its overseas voyages. It was a fateful decision, for just at that time, Portugal was beginning to send its ships down the west coast of Africa. In the centuries that followed, European explorers would sail to all parts of the world. They would establish colonies in Africa, America, and finally in the nations of East Asia. China would suffer because it had turned its back on exploration. Zheng He had started the process that might have led the Middle Kingdom to greater glory Unfortunately the rulers of the Ming Dynasty refused to follow his lead.  Zheng He died in the tenth year of the reign of the Ming emperor Xuande (1435) and was buried in the southern outskirts of Bull's Head Hill (Niushou) in Nanjing.  In 1985, during the 580th anniversary of Zheng He's voyage, his tomb was restored. The new tomb was built on the site of the original tomb in Nanjing and reconstructed according to the customs of Islamic teachings, as Zheng He was a Muslim.  At the entrance to the tomb is a Ming-style structure, which houses the memorial hall. Inside are paintings of the man himself and his navigation maps. To get to the tomb, there are newly laid stone platforms and steps. The stairway consists of 28 stone steps divided into four sections with each section having seven steps. This represents Zheng He's seven journeys to the West. The Arabic words "Allah (God) is great" are inscribed on top of the tomb.

       urlLink    Sunset captured, 250 m from the base camp&nbsp; urlLink     A belated account of my adventure in Sabah, well, as much as I can remember.  March 19:  My adventure begins when I was invited by the stewardess to join the captain in the cockpit, and I have never been inside one. It sure was hot inside the cockpit, with the sun glaring right into your face. The captain and co-pilot were very friendly and showed me how the plane works, but would not let me touch any buttons though.  Upon arrival at the Kota Kinabalu airport at 9:30 am on Wednesday morning, we journeyed on a coach for 3 hours through Ranau and Kundasang to Kinabalu Park and checked into our hostels. This is the first time in my life I had to sleep in a room full of strangers and it was a co-ed hostel with common bathrooms. After a refreshing shower, I joined the others for a lunch at the coffee house. Food was very expensive, my dinner comprising rice, vegetables and mushrooms costs RM20! I was very tired and sleepy, and was having menstrual pain so I went back the hostel and slept the whole afternoon and woke up in time for shower and dinner which costs another RM20!  I slept early that night, and woke up at 5 am. After breakfast, the coach took us to Mesilau Gate to start our adventure. The Mesilau Summit Trail was a 8-10 hour climb uphill most of the way, it's the more challenging route compared to Timpohon Trail which is easier and shorter route by 2000 m or 3 hours climb. The Mesilau route experience priceless, beyond words. I'd do it again.   March 20:   urlLink    Mt. Kinabalu Expedition Team led by Peter Lau&nbsp; urlLink     The journey through Mesilau was quite treacherous for non-seasoned climber like me, but the scenic view and beautiful surroundings was worth the emotionally and physically trying journey. We walked on a narrow ridge lined with bonsai trees, and rare plants and flowers. The view was breathtaking, and the air smells so delicious. From the ridge I looked down in disbelief at how far I've climbed - I couldn't see the bottom of the pit, it spiraled down into a dark grey mist.  Being a slow climber, I reached the first base camp, Laban Rata quite late, and had to use torch light to light the path. The patient and helpful mountain guides, Jule and Biling, were with me then and it was a full moon, so I wasn't scared, in fact I felt fearless and enjoyed my adventure.   I started off my climb with the younger climbers, and towards the middle of my climb with the older climbers and towards the base camp, I was just ahead by just 500 m from the oldest climber, Uncle Fong, who wanted to celebrate his 70th birthday at The Peak.   In trying to make up for the time I had lost admiring the flora and fauna, and not to finish last, especially to a 70 year-old, I sped up my pace. Neverthless, just half an hour later, Jule and Biling said we had to retrace our steps backwards to look for Uncle Fong, who seem to have gotten lost. Fortunately, we managed to find Uncle Fong, and in good time, too, before it gets too dark and foggy.   I got there in time for dinner, took a shower and hit the sack for about over an hour. Then I was awakened by an orchestra of snores - bass, alto and tenor - horrendous, especially Tony, the guy who slept in the bunk next to me was snoring the loudest and I felt like stuffing his mouth with my dirty socks. I tossed and turned and couldn't sleep for the rest of the night. Urrgggghhhh!  March 21:  The next morning, we started off at 3am. My torchlight battery was weak as I used them to search for Uncle Fong the night before. So I was guided by the moonlight and another guide, Cornelius. After climbing some 1000m, it rained, and the wind was strong and chilly, the temperature was below freezing. Another one team member pulled out and turned back, and another 1000m, two more pulled out.   We took a short break at the second base camp, Sayat Sayat Hut, to report our ascent with the warden and take a bite and sip. Another team member pulled out and turned back. I was tempted to turn back because I was shivering cold, but I kept reminding myself, I have a goal to achieve this year and it would be the greatest tragedy not to at least do my best as I've come this far, and I was already on my way up. I kept telling myself, "I can do it!" and I just get on. There's no turning back!   The lack of sleep got to me, when I fell asleep for a few seconds during the ascent. The guide reminded me not to fall asleep because it will affect my energy level. So I pressed on slowly.  When I was about to give up, Cornelius took me by the hand and encouraged me to keep on climbing.  The climb up was ascending all the way, until we reached the Summit Plateau. Then it got steeper and we used ropes to help us climb to the peak. On my way up, like 200 army cadets climbed up with me as part of their training, so and I thought  only cities are congested. And there's only one rope, so you got to wait your turn. The rope took so long, so guide took me on another route up. So it feels good when we overtook the army men :)   urlLink    Mt Kinabalu conquered!&nbsp; urlLink                                                        And YESSSSS....after 4 hours, I made it to the peak! And it felt GREAT :) Believe me, Low's Peak which is the highest peak, was congested when I got there! Some of the army men were there and some of my team members were taking pictures. I had to wait for my turn! And my camera battery died on me! And I didn't get to see the sunrise because it rained and the mist was quite thick. Double bummer!   I stayed at the peak for less than an hour. Took a picture with the group and had a snack and chatted with other climbers who came from other countries, especially if they're good looking.  Some people told me not to look down because you will feel scared. But as I sat perched on a rock at the peak, I looked down to Low's Gully anyways, and it felt exhilarating, because I am on top of the world amidst the clouds and I felt fearless. The mist made it look like a bottomless pit because you can't see any further than 1000m down.   I started my descend back to the Sayat-Sayat Hut base camp to report my descent and take a short break. Descending was very hard on the knees and thighs, and I had to descend backwards using ropes. Felt like I was in the movie "Cliffhanger" when I actually lost my footing and dangled from a rope as I swung on the cliff wall. The guide was quick to pull the end of the rope back before I swung to the other side. So the only damage was that I banged my hip on the cliff wall and I got wet. Everyone was worried for a while, and I made some of them scream. I guess they were anticipating a cliffhanger casualty, but was relieved when I told them "that was fun" when I climbed down the rope and walked on like nothing happened.   The descent took about 3 hours and we came back to the Laban Rata base camp in time for breakfast at 10:30 am where I spent RM4.50 for a bowl of miserable Maggi Mee. Within the next hour, I made my descent back to lowland through the Timpohon Trail. Although the route was shorter and simpler the journey back was challenging because after halfway, I twisted my ankle, had blisters on my toes and another toe nail was coming off! I was in pain for hours, but endured it because no matter what, I had to get to Timpohon Gate because there's no other way out of there except on your legs and I can't be asking the guides to carry me! When I reached Timpohon Gate, I shouted victoriously with joy, "YESSSS!!!" I've achieved one resolution this year - to climb to the peak of Mount Kinabalu.   That night we stopped over at Poring Hot Springs and spent the night in the hostel.  By now I've  gotten used to sleeping in a room with strangers, and not scream when I see a bug, rather, I was too tired to fuss over such trivialities. The hot springs did wonders to sooth the muscle aches and I slept soundly that night.   March 22:  The next day, we were back to Kota Kinabalu and back to civilization. That night, I joined the group for some seafood dinner at the Sedco Square in the city, and braved myself to taste escargots for the first time. Well, they taste like scallops. After dinner, we went to the night market in Gaya Street to buy some souvenir t-shirts.  As we walked down Gaya Street and passed Pizza Hut and Sugar Bun restaurants, I was surprised to see how much this particular strip has changed over the past year, the whole place looks like Bintang Walk in Kuala Lumpur. With live band playing good music, people sipping coffee and cocktails. It is a place you go to be seen. Yes, they have just caught on the coffee bar culture. And I was in drawstring khakis and plain t-shirt lugging my backpack like a tourist on a budget! If I knew this is going to be like Bintang Walk, I would dress up to be seen. Bummer!  March 23:  The next morning, I was in dilemma in choosing between scouring the city for some shopping or shoot rapids on Padas River.   I decided to shoot rapids, because as my legs are sore anyways, shopping and rafting will be equally strenuous. I decided to be a "trialthon" - I must try anything at least once. Besides, I can shop anytime in Kuala Lumpur and it will be a lot cheaper. It was the right decision.  The next morning, we took a train from Beaufort. On the train, I was glad to make friends and have interesting conversation with John, an Aussie diver from Sydney, who was in our rafting group. We talked the whole of the journey to and back, and during stops at riverbanks during the rafting. That was good, because the whole group are Chinese and they speak Cantonese to each other most of the time, and English occasionally only when they speak to me. After a few days of not talking much, I was on the brink of restlessness. Phew! Next time I must learn some Cantonese.   We changed train, and dropped our backpacks at Pangi, and later continued our train ride to another station downstream, where we will start off rafting upstream back to Pangi. After some light snacks, we put on our life jackets and helmets and hopped into our rafts. We were given options to go for beginner or adventure rafting, and I decided to have some adventure. After all, isn't adventure what I was looking for? It was a good decision because I enjoyed myself every minute of it. Fear was never in my mind.   Besides shooting rapids - so many of them and they have interesting names like Lambada, Headhunter, Cobra, Washing Machine, Scooby Dooby Do - the other part I enjoyed most is body rafting where you just jump into the river and go with the river flow and then after some 250m swim back to the river bank or the raft whichever is nearer. It's like soaking in "chai latte" or "teh tarik kurang manis" and I don't know why they call it "white water" rafting when the water is not white!   After the rafting we had some barbeque and noodles lunch by the riverbank before we head back to the city. The train back to Beaufort was delayed by the heavy rain and took shelter on a bridge. The covered bridge reminds me of a book I read, "The Bridges of Madison County", which has a picture of a covered bridge on its cover. From the bridge to the station was a good long walk, and thanks to the genius of Damien, one of my team members whom I nicknamed "Mr. Six Packs",  we got across in a huge umbrella borrowed from one of the food stalls.  On the way to Kota Kinabalu, the bus passed Jalan Ramaya Putatan where my ex-in laws live and it brought back many nostalgic memories of The Ex-Husband and me spending time with his family. The good times, bad ones. But I have no regrets, it was good while it lasted. Well, that chapter of my life is now closed. When you have hit rock bottom and reach to a point of no return, the only way to go is up and forward. No turning back.  We arrived at the Kota Kinabalu airport just in time for boarding.  Peter, our team leader, who skipped the rafting adventure, has already checked in our luggage and gotten our boarding passes. The flight home was short, we arrived half an hour early, so the pilots must be speeding!  Back in Kuala Lumpur, being a workaholic, the first thing on my mind was work! Oh no! Back to the grind and humdrum of everyday life. But on a positive note, at least for a week, I was living life to the fullest and enjoying every moment of my adventure :)   No regrets!

      I believe that if God brings you to it, God will bring you through it. He brought me this desire to conquer a mountain and yes, I made it, Mt Kinabalu conquered! Conquering Mt Kinabalu is one turning point in my life. It liberated me mentally, got me to think that if I set my mind on something, no matter how hard it seems to me, I can do it. Physical limitations are minor, mental limitations are what stop you from achieveing your goal and getting what you want in life. I understand that now -when you want to achieve something very badly, the whole universe will conspire with you to help you achieve your dreams or goals. Some of you probably won't be impressed, having conquered mountains, and oceans, heaven and hell, no doubt. But for me it's a new heights of personal achievement as I've never done it before - conquering the highest mountain in South East Asia at 35,000 ft, a feat I managed to achieve after training for 3 months climbing five other mountains.

      Sometime in May 2003  My dear Yaya Buddies,  True enough, there are a thousand thoughts lying within a woman that she does not know till he takes up a pen to write. So many thots are running through my head but I haven't got time to jot them them down lately, so you got me!   urlLink    Top Model Down Under&nbsp; urlLink      Anyways, g'day mates, having a wonderful time Down Under. Been hopping about some parts of the Victoria country. Here's a short round up of my travel.    Spent Saturday and Sunday in Melbourne.    Had breakie with Pete's sister's Rie's home and went to Vic Market for some shopping. Missed the footy on Saturday because I snoozed. Bummer! But no worries, that night we hopped on a tram to Chinatown to have some Asian dinner. Nothing like they make it home for sure.    After dinner we went up Rialto Towers to get an aerial city view of Melbourne, it was magnificent and breathtaking. Pete wouldn't go to the deck with me, he's afraid of heights. So I went to stand there and did a Titatic thingy, it was exciting. When I get back in, I teased Pete, "You just missed an opportunity for a passionate kiss, maybe more..." and he said "Bummer, I would have gathered all my courage to go to the deck with you if you had only mentioned it earlier!"  Well, gotcha, Pete!   On Sunday, we walked up St Kilda Boardwalk. There's an amusement park called Luna Park and arts and crafts at St. Kilda Esplanade. Had a fish and chips picnic by the beach. Later we went to visit Pete's friend, Leanne who lives in Cheltenham. Her mom designs totes and dinner bags. I couldn't decide  between three designs so Pete got me all.    We got to Pete's home in Pioneer Bay, about two hours from Melbourne later that day. Very much a bachelor's pad with a bachelor and two teenagers living here, Pete, eldest son Paul and Ian, the youngest son. I appreciated Pete's effort in being the hospitable host, but being a perfectionist, I couldn't help but reorganised the guest room just before I went to bed.   Monday, we went to Maru Park to spend some time with the kangaroos, wallabies and wombats and snacked on Devonshire tea, that is, scones with jam and cream, and tea or coffee. Seems to be a favorite here, and I can see why, mmmm, yummy! That night, we went shopping at Cranbourne and later Pete's friend Zena, came over for a visit.   Tuesday, we went around Warook Cattle Farm, tried to milk the cows but they won't let me!    urlLink    Warrook Cattle Farm&nbsp; urlLink     Later we went up to Cranbourne Park shopping mall in Cranbourne. Paul and his other kids, Tarnya, Philip and Ian came for dinner, I cooked chicken curry, beef ginger with baby bok choy, chap chye and lamb madagascar. Had fun watching them kids try eat rice with fingers. His kids are well behaved and polite. Ian, the cutest, is charming even at 15 years old.   Wednesday morning we went to Carribean Gardens flea market where I bought a sheepskin rug for AUD50. They sell everything from buttons to computer chips. Met up with his brother Mark there. He's a biker, very rugged. Afternoon we went to an aromatherapy oils factory outlet in Hallam, and later watched seals at The Nobbies and Penguins Parade at sunset at the Phillip Island.   urlLink    The Great Ocean Road: Waves down at The Grotto&nbsp; urlLink      Thursday, we drove along the coast on The Great Ocean Road to Sovereign Hill, Ballarat to dig some gold, no luck. Then we drove to Warrnambool, and put up a night at his mom's in Koirot, an Irish town where they grow potatoes. His mom is a wonderful 80 year-old woman who can still walk a mile to church every Sunday.  She's really funny and very funky too, and she asked me, "Are you sleeping with Pete?" before deciding which room for me to sleep in - Omigod, I really blushed, and of course, I took the guest room. I can't imagine my mom asking that question!    urlLink    At Koirot Bar, Pete Kelly sipped orange juice&nbsp; urlLink     That night we really dressed up for some fine dining in a restaurant called Portofino, in a seaside holiday and fishing town, Port Fairy. Pete looks good in the beige Shanghai shirt that I got him as a present. He looks strikingly handsome that the waitress was flirting with him. I put on my favorite ankle length biased-cut lightly sequined turqoise skirt that I got from Salabianca, and wore it with a white lycra top. It was cold, so I draped a turqoise silk pashmina wrap around my shoulders. It feels so romantic, and I felt beautiful :)   Friday, after breakie, we bade his mom goodbye and drove along the Great Ocean Road. Breathtaking view. Took dozens of pictures. Lunched on a homemade beef pie at Port Campbell, seaside holiday town and port. Met up with Mark and his girlfriend Jessie halfway along the the Great Ocean Road for drinks. Went to Dandenong for Italian dinner with his friends, Dona, Sue and Debbie, and later went to visit his friends George and Sally who just moved to a new home, their dream house. Very nice and sprawling. Before we went home, Pete picked up Ian and Dean, who's Ian's half brother (and I found out later is Pete's ex-wife's illegitimate son). Long story there, but met his ex-wife who doesn't seem friendly, but oh well. Not like I'm marrying Pete, anyways.   This morning I packed my things and found my luggage not big enough to fit in everything. So Ray, his friend and neighbor lent me his suitcase. Tonight we're having my friend Lynn over for a BBQ. Ray may join us too. Lynn and her hubby Faiz just moved to Melbourne in January, so she's thrilled to meet new friends.   Pete and I will have brunch with Leanne and her mom, Lorraine, the bag designer on Sunday morning before I go to the airport. Plane leaving at 3pm. Ian just asked Pete if he can come along with me to the airport. Pete asked why, and he said "so that I can follow her home to Malaysia!  See, he's adorable!   Well, I'll see you guys back home. Did you have that party when I'm away???   Cheers, Liza

      The British submarine engineer and historian Gavin Menzies gave an astounding seminar on March 15, 2002 to the Royal Geographical Society in London, with evidence to support his theory that Zheng He, a Chinese Muslim navigator in the Ming dynasty, beat Columbus by more than 70 years in discovering America.  Using evidence from maps drawn dated before Columbus' trip that clearly showed America, and astronomical maps traced back to Zheng He's time, Menzies is confident that the Zheng He should be honored as the first discoverer of America.  Menzies's conclusion is based on 14 years of research that includes secret maps, evidence of artifacts, and apparent proof of the voyage provided by the modern astronomy software program Starry Night.  As key evidence for a voyage that will remake history, Menzies says he obtained ancient Chinese navigation charts associated with the travels of Zheng He. The journey ran from 1421 to 1423. Menzies maintains that the ships sailed around the Southern tips of both Africa and South America.    The late evening southern sky as it would have looked on March 18, 1421, from off the southern tip of South America. Reconstructed with Starry Night Software to compare with maps found from Zheng He's voyages.  "I set Starry Night up for dates in 1421 for parts of the world where I thought the Chinese had sailed," explained Menzies, a navigation expert and former Royal Navy submarine commander. He found that in two separate locations of the voyage, easily recognizable stars were directly above Zheng He's fleet.  Those stars have since moved, due to changes in Earth's orientation in space. Earth's spin is slightly imperfect, and its axis carves a circle on the sky every 26,000 years. The phenomenon, called precession, means that each pole points to different stars as time progresses. Menzies used the software program to recreate the sky as it would have looked in 1421.  "I had Chinese star charts, and I needed to date the charts," he said. "By an incredible bit of luck, one of the courses they steered, between Sumatra and Dondra Head, Ceylon, was due west."  This part of the journey was very near the equator in the Indian Ocean. Both Polaris, the North Star, and the bright southern star Canopus, which was very nearly above the celestial south pole, were on the charts. "From that I was able to determine the apparent shift of Polaris (due to precession). I could therefore date the chart to 1421, plus or minus 30 years."  Phillip Sadler, a celestial navigation expert at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, says the estimation of a map's age based on star positions is possible. He said an estimate within 30 years, as Menzies claims, is possible.   About Zheng He:   Zheng He (1371-1435), or Cheng Ho, is China's most famous navigator. He built a total of 1622 ships and made at least seven major excursions between 1405 AD and 1430 AD. He traveled more than 50,000km and visited over 30 countries, reaching Somalia and probably Europe (France, Holland and Portugal).  Zheng He constructed many wooden ships, some of which are the largest in the history, in Nanjing. Three of the shipyards still exist today.  In each trip, he led a troop of 27,800 people on more than 300 ships. In each trip, 62 major ships of this fleet were employed, each over 400 ft long and 193 ft wide, holding 1000 people per ship, dwarfing Columbus' Santa Maria (75 ft x 25 ft) more than six-fold.  In the 1930s, a stone pillar was discovered in a town in Fujian province. It held an inscription that described the amazing voyages of Zheng He.  Zheng He described how the emperor of the Ming Dynasty had ordered him to sail to "the countries beyond the horizon," all the way to the end of the earth." His mission was to display the might of Chinese.  The pillar contains the Chinese names for the countries Zheng He visited. He wrote:  We have...beheld in the ocean huge waves like mountains rising sky-high, and we have set eyes on barbarian regions far away hidden in a blue transparency of light vapors, while our sails, loftily unfurled like clouds, day and night continued their course rapid like that of a star, transversing the savage waves as if we were treading a public thoroughfare.   The countries and territories covered and recorded in the official Ming history includes Java, Sumatra, Vietnam, Siam, Cambodia, Philippines, Ceylon, Bangladesh, India, Yemen, Arabia, Somalia, Mogadishu. As a clear demonstration of his travel to Africa, among the souvenirs he brought back to China were the giraffes and lions, indigenous animals of Africa.  The official history also mentioned "Franca" (which was the territory to describe today's France and Portugal) and Holland. The Hollanders were described as tall people with red hair and beard, long nose, and deep eye sockets. If he did meet with the Europeans in their native countries, then the only way would be to navigate around the Cape of Good Hope before the Suez Canal was a throughway.  Unfortunately, Zheng He's magnificent accomplishment was later targeted by other courtiers as wasteful. Most of his records were destroyed and building of ships with more than three masts were considered crimes punishable by death. So, a large part of his excursion (which might include the America part) has no reports.  In Africa near Kenya today, there are tribes that are clearly Asian-looking. They also consider themselves as the descendants of Zheng He's crew.  His achievements show that China had the ships and navigational skills to explore the world. Mysteriously, China did not follow up on these voyages. The Chinese destroyed their ocean going ships and halted further expeditions. Thus, a century later, Europeans would "discover" China, instead of the Chinese "discovering" Europe.  China has a very old seafaring tradition. Chinese ships had sailed to India as early as the Han Dynasty. Chinese sailors had an important invention to help them-the compass. The compass, or "south pointing spoon," started out as a fortune-telling instrument used like an Ouija board. By the Song era, sailors had taken it up. As a foreign ship captain wrote, "In dark, weather they look to the south pointing needle, and use a sounding line to determine the smell and nature of the mud on the sea bottom, and so know where they are.  Chinese shipbuilders also developed fore-and-aft sails, the sternpost rudder, and boats with paddlewheels. Watertight compartments below decks kept the ship from sinking. Some boats were armor plated for protection. All these developments made long distance navigation possible.  After the Mongols were overthrown in 1368, the emperor of the new Ming Dynasty wanted to assert Chinese power. Because China was no longer part of a land empire that stretched from Asia to Europe, the emperor turned to the sea. He decided to build a navy. The Chinese made elaborate plans that would not be fulfilled for many years. A shipyard was built at the new capital of Najing (Nanking). Thousand of varnish and tung trees were planted on nearby Purple Mountain to provide wood for shipbuilding. The emperor established a school of foreign languages to train interpreters. While all this was going on, the man who would lead the navy was still an infant.   China's greatest adventurer, the 15th century Muslim, Admiral  Zheng He   Zheng He was born in 1371 in Kunyang, a town in southwest Yunnan Province. His family, named Ma, were part of a minority group known as the Semur. They originally came from Central Asia and followed the religion of Islam. Both his grandfather and father had made the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. Zheng He grew up hearing their accounts of travel through foreign lands.  Yunnan was one of the last strongholds of Mongol support, holding out long after the Ming Dynasty began. After Ming armies conquered Yunnan in 1382, Zheng He was taken captive and brought to Nanjing. The eleven year old boy was made a servant of the prince who would become the Yong Le Emperor.  It was Yong Le who renamed the boy Zheng He.  Zheng He is described in Chinese historical records as tall and heavy, with "clear-cut features and long ear lobes; a stride like a tiger's and voice clear and vibrant." He was well liked and admired for his quick wit in argument. Moreover, he was a brave soldier. When his prince seized the Chinese throne from his nephew, Zheng He fought well on his behalf. As a result, Zheng He became a close confidant of the new emperor and was given an important position at court.  The Yong Le emperor had ambitious plans. A vigorous man, he rebuilt the Great Wall to the condition in which it exists today. He also built his new capital at Beijing, next to the remains of the former Yuan capital. The emperor decided to go ahead with the sea voyages that had long been planned. He appointed Zheng He to lead them and gave him the title "Admiral of the Western Seas."  At each country Zheng He visited, he was to present gifts from the emperor and to exact tribute for the glory of the Ming. The Chinese had a unique view of foreign relations. Because China developed its culture in isolation from other great civilization, it says itself as the center of the world. The Chinese called their country "the Middle Kingdom."  The Chinese emperor's duty was to attract "all under heaven" to be civilized in Confucian harmony. When foreign ambassadors came to the Chinese court, they "kowtowed" as they approached the emperor. (The required process of "kowtow" was to kneel three times and bow one's head to the floor three times at each kneeling.) In return for tribute from other countries, the emperor sent gifts and special seals that confirmed their rulers' authority. In fact, these foreign kings were officially made part of the Ming Dynasty.  In 1405 Zheng He set out on his first voyage. No nation on earth had ever sent such a fleet onto the ocean. It included sixty-two large ships, some 600 feet long, larger than any other on the seas. Hundreds of smaller vessels accompanied them. A Chinese historian described them; "The ships which sail the Southern Sea are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky."  Zheng He's first port of call was in Champa, a part of today's Vietnam. He was surprised to find many Chinese living there. Merchants and craftsmen had emigrated from the coastal provinces since the time of the Tang Dynasty. They had already helped to spread Confucian ideals, and Champs's ruler willingly offered tribute for the Chinese emperor. In return, of course, Zheng He presented the king with lavish gifts that were probably more valuable.   Zheng He sailed away from the coast, westward across the Indian Ocean. The ships traveled for days out of sight of any land. Then they encountered a hurricane. The ships tossed wildly in the fierce storm and seemed to be on the verge of sinking. Then a "divine light" suddenly shone at the tips of the mast. "As soon as this miraculous light appeared, the danger was appeased," Zheng He wrote.    When the Chinese sailors reached Calicut, India, their giant ships created a stir. The ruler there presented his visitors with sashes made of gold spun into hair-fine threads and studded with large pearls and precious stones. The Chinese were entertained with music and songs. One crew member wrote that the Indians' musical instruments were "made of gourds with strings of red copper wire, and the sound and rhythm were pleasant to the ears."  On the way back to China, the fleet threaded its way through the Straits of Malacca, stopping at the large islands of Sumatra and Java. Zheng He established a base at the Straits that he would use for each of his seven voyages. There are thousands of smaller islands in this vast archipelago, and some were pirates' lairs. The pirates preyed on unwary fishermen and small merchant vessels.  Zheng He, showing how the emperor treated those who disrupted harmony, attacked and destroyed a fleet of pirate ships. He captured the leader and brought him back to Beijing for execution.  When Zheng He returned, the emperor was pleased. He sent his admiral on ever-longer voyages. Seven times, Zheng He's ships set sail for unknown lands. On and on he went, following his orders to travel as far as he could. He reached Arabia, where he fulfilled a personal dream. He made the pilgrimage to Mecca that is the duty of every good Muslim once in his lifetime. He also visited Prophet Muhammad Mosque in Medina. On the fifth voyage, he reached the coast of Africa, landing in Somalia on the east coast.   Zheng He organized each expedition on an enormous scale. Besides sailors and navigators, they included doctors, scribes, shipwrights, and cooks. On some voyages Muslim religious leaders and Buddhist monks were brought along to serve as diplomats in lands where people were Muslim or Buddhist.  Each ship brought enough food to last the whole voyage, in case "barbarian" food was not acceptable. In addition to rice and other food that could be preserved, the ships carried huge tubs of earth on deck so that vegetables and fruit could be grown.  On each voyage the fleet anchored at the Malacca base, where provisions, tribute, and gifts were stored in warehouses. Zheng He found that foreign kings and princes particularly admired the famous blue-and-white Ming porcelain dishes, vases, and cups. Foreigners still yearned for Chinese silk, for cotton printed with Chinese designs, and for the coarse but long lasting, brownish yellow cloth known as Nankeen because it was made in Nanking (now Nanjing). The holds of Zheng He's ships were also crammed with gold and silver, iron tools, copper kitchenware, and perfumes.  In exchange for such wares, and as tribute, Zheng He brought back medicinal herbs, dyes, spices, precious, gems, pearls, rhinoceros horns, ivory, and exotic animals. On the homeward voyage, the fleet again stopped at their base to sort out the foreign goods and wait for a favorable wind to return to China.  The expeditions were an important source of information about foreign countries. A crewmember described the Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal off the east coast of India:   Its inhabitants live in the hollows of trees and caves. Both men and women there go about stark naked, like wild beasts, without a stitch of clothing on them. No rice grows there. The people subsist solely on wild yams, jackfruit and plantains, or upon the fish which they catch. There is a legend current among them that, if they wear the smallest scrap of clothing, their bodies would break into sores and ulcers, owing to their ancestors having been cursed by Buddha for having stolen and hidden his clothes while he was bathing.  In Sri Lanka, the Chinese visited Buddhist Temple Hill, where Buddha was said to have left his footprint on a rock. They marveled at all the temples, particularly one that held a relic of the Buddha's tooth. According to a crew member, the people of the island do not venture to eat cow's flesh, they merely drink the milk. When a cow dies they bury it. It is capital punishment for anyone to secretly kill a cow; he who does so can however escape punishment by paying a ransom of a cow's head made of solid gold.  Sri Lanka seemed like a treasure island, where rubies and other precious stones were abundant. The people harvested pearls from the sea and had discovered the trick of making cultured pearls by planting a speck of sand inside an oyster's shell.  The king of Sri Lanka was an ardent Buddhist who treated both cows and elephants with religious respect. However, because he did not show proper respect for the ambassadors from the Son of Heaven, he was taken back to China for "instruction." He was returned to his island on a later voyage.  When the Chinese reached the east coast of Africa, they found people who built houses of brick. "Men and women wear their hair in rolls; when they go out they wear a linen hood. There are deep wells worked by means of cog wheels. Fish are caught in the sea with nets." The Africans offered such goods a "dragon saliva, incense, and golden amber."   The Chinese found the African animals even more amazing. There included "lion, gold-spotted leopards, and camel-birds (ostriches), which are six or seven feet tall." The most exciting thing that Zheng He ever brought back to the emperor's count was a giraffe.  The animal came from today's Somalia. In the Somali Language, the name for giraffe sounds similar to the Chinese word for unicorn. It was easy to imagine that this was the legendary animal that had played an important part in the birth of Confucius. Surely, it must be a sign of Heaven's favor on the emperor's reign.   When the giraffe arrived in 1415, the emperor himself went to the palace gate to receive it, as well as a "celestial horse" (zebra) and a "celestial stag" (oryx). The palace officials offered congratulations and performed the kowtow before the heavenly animals.  When Zheng He came back from his seventh voyage in 1433, he was sixty-two years old. He had accomplished much for China, spreading the glory of the Middle Kingdom to many countries that now sent tribute and ambassadors to the court. Though he died soon afterward, his exploits had won him fame. Plays and novels were written about his voyages.   In such places as Malacca and Java, towns, caves, and temples were named after him.  However, a new Ming emperor had come to the throne. His scholar-officials criticized Zheng's achievements, complaining about their great expense. China was now fighting another barbarian enemy on its western borders and needed to devote its resources to that struggle. When a court favorite wanted to continue Zheng He's voyages, he was turned down. To make sure, the court officials destroyed the logs that Zheng He had kept. We know about his voyages only from the pillar and some accounts that his crewmembers wrote.  Thus, China abandoned its overseas voyages. It was a fateful decision, for just at that time, Portugal was beginning to send its ships down the west coast of Africa. In the centuries that followed, European explorers would sail to all parts of the world. They would establish colonies in Africa, America, and finally in the nations of East Asia. China would suffer because it had turned its back on exploration. Zheng He had started the process that might have led the Middle Kingdom to greater glory.   Unfortunately the rulers of the Ming Dynasty refused to follow his lead. Zheng He died in the tenth year of the reign of the Ming emperor Xuande (1435) and was buried in the southern outskirts of Bull's Head Hill (Niushou) in Nanjing.   In 1985, during the 580th anniversary of Zheng He's voyage, his tomb was restored. The new tomb was built on the site of the original tomb in Nanjing and reconstructed according to the customs of Islamic teachings, as Zheng He was a Muslim.  At the entrance to the tomb is a Ming-style structure, which houses the memorial hall. Inside are paintings of the man himself and his navigation maps. To get to the tomb, there are newly laid stone platforms and steps. The stairway consists of 28 stone steps divided into four sections with each section having seven steps. This represents Zheng He's seven journeys to the West. The Arabic words "Allah (God) is great" are inscribed on top of the tomb.

      I went on an assignment to Doha, Qatar, in June 2003. My assignment was to handle media management for our signing ceremony for a construction of a college of technology, and to accompany Malaysian journalists, Nurzuhaira Ruhanie (Business Times) and Arul Rajoo (Bernama), who were specially brought to cover the event. My job was also to manage speech, press releases and media registration, and ensure safe handling of souvenirs for the client from Kuala Lumpur to Doha.  On the same trip, I was also accompanying my company's Chairman, Datuk Abu Hassan Kendut, our Engineering & Construction Division President, Dato' Mohd Nor Idrus, and Project Director, Sulaihah Maimunni.  Sunday, June 22:  I met with Arul and Nor at KL Sentral, at 9:00 p.m. and helped them check-in their tickets and luggage and distributed boarding passes. Having done all that, I gave them a short briefing on the trip. The main objective is, of course, to get a good media coverage for UEM Group.  Our flight was delayed, so I bought dinner for them, too, at The Chicken Rice Shop in KL Sentral - their choice. Only at 10:00 p.m. we boarded the KLIA Express to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. It took just 28 minutes, and we boarded our flight at 11:30 p.m. Fortunately, I got a seat next to both Arul and Nor, so I got a good chance to be friends with them. Arul is funny and chatty, and Nor is serious and quiet.   Our flight to Doha, Qatar was tiring - 15 hrs of flight in an economy class with a 5 hour stop over in Dubai. Nothing much to do during my transit in Dubai but shopping and I don't have much money to shop. Branded goods are much cheaper in Dubai, so it would be nice if I have lots of money to spend.   While in transit, we made acquaintance with a fellow countryman, Jamil Ahmad, who is an attache with the Malaysian Embassy in Sudan. The cafe we had coffee at was expensive, yet it was probably the cheapest place to be at Dubai Airport. Nevertheless, it was panoramic - I see so many beautiful women, whom I was told by Jamil that some of them are prostitutes, many coming poorer European countries, and their flesh trade goes across international borders.   As I slowly chewed on my sandwich and sipped my espresso, I watched them solicit clients. The interesting thing is they looked so not-hooker-like dressed that they don't like the hookers I saw on TV. Very much like Julia Roberts' character in the movie, "Pretty Woman" when she was all dressed up decently, as opposed to the character played by her fellow hooker house mate (I forgot her name).  Monday, 23 June 2003:  With good company and interesting conversation, five hours seem to breeze by easily before we boarded the flight to Doha. From Dubai to Doha is just over an hour, and I sat next to a Lebanese woman from Beirut. It was interesting to learn about Beirut from her.  We arrived in Qatar around 10:00 in the morning, and yet, it was very very hot, it was 50^C. Strong hot wind, like having hot air hairdryer blown at me just as I stepped out of the plane into a bus that ferried us to the airport terminal.   At the airport, we have to apply and pay for the visa right there and then. I think it cost some QR 150 or QR165. I helped Nor and Arul with their visa application, currency exchange and baggage claim. Sulaihah was kind enough to show me how to go about things - I was glad.  We were greeted by our Qatar Office's Project Manager, Joe Doyle, a friendly Scot,  and our Chief Operating Officer, James Wong, and scooted off to Doha Marriot Hotel and checked in by 11:00 a.m.    After making sure that Nor and Arul are checked into their own rooms, and comfortably accomodated, I went to meet the photographer to brief him on angles. Then, I met with the hotel's arrogant and unfriendly Banquet Manager and briefed her on how I want the media registration arrangements to be.  After the briefings, I consulted with Joe, James, Sulaihah and Datuk Mohd Nor who verified information in speech, news release and frequently asked questions. Finally, at 1:00 p.m., I accompanied Mr. Arul and Cik Norzuhaira for lunch at the hotel. There was not enough time to eat out.  By 2:30 p.m., I was prolifically revising the Chairman's speech, our news release and frequently asked questions and assembling press kits for Malaysian, Qatar and regional media representatives. At the same time, arranging with the very helpful hotel’s gift shop owner, a Filipino lady, to decorate souvenirs for client.  By 6:00 p.m. I was ready with all my press kits, and I gave a set of press kit each to Nor and Arul so they get a headstart earlier from the regional media. Which they were grateful for. By 6:45 p.m., my media registration desk was ready.    I found out there are only two English language media and three Arabic language media in Qatar. For the signing ceremony, all the Qatar media and some of the regional media turned up.  Besides Bernama and Business Times, 12 media representatives from six media houses were present from Gulf Times, The Peninsula, Al-Sharq, Al-Hayat, AFP and Al-Raya.    urlLink    Nor, Arul and Naliza&nbsp; urlLink     The signing ceremony started at 7:30 p.m, followed by speeches, exchange of documents and press conference, and everything was done so quickly and by 8:00 p.m. dinner was served. The guests and gourmet feast looked so lavish that Arul and Nor didn't want to join the dinner, as the regional media was not invited either, and the guests looked so pompous and arrogant.   So, to spare ourselves of the uneasiness, we decided to go out and eat, and walk the city as far as our feet can take us. Fortunately, Nor has a friend who works in an advertising agency in Doha, and we met her for dinner that night.   We went to a Chinese restaurant not far from Doha Marriot, which featured lousy live performance by Filipino singers, and the food was just manageable, but cost a bomb. Nevertheless, we had a good time, making new friends. I enjoyed myself although I was too tired I could easily fall asleep while walking.  By 11:30 p.m., we were back at Doha Marriott, and I met with the photographer to get photographs and digital images for our Malaysian news release, and for Nor and Arul to use in their feature stories. I was also busy emailing the final version of our news release, speech, frequently asked questions and selected digital images to Group Corporate Communications in Kuala Lumpur.  Tuesday, 24 June 2003  When I woke up just before 7:00 a.m., Nor was already busy typing away at her laptop. Later at about 9:30 a.m. Arul knocked on our room door to borrow the internet connection that I have requested. So, I assisted them in sending their stories and selected digital images to their respective offices via email.   By 10:00 a.m., we were having breakfast at the coffee house overlooking the swimming pool and the ocean. Nor said she wanted to see the sites, so I brought her and Arul to our project sites. Later I found out she meant the sights. What a bummer!  After the trip to the project sites, I took them shopping at the malls and the souk (indoor bazaar). Things are terribly expensive there (mostly branded items). Even food is very expensive - I only managed to do window shopping and bought some pistachio dates and Celine Eau de Parfum (which is on promotion) for my mom, at the malls, and bought some dates and nougats at the souk.  Our designated escort told me, there are more men than women in Qatar, like 4:1 ratio. But most of them are foreign workers from India, Myanmar, Philippines and Indonesia, and technical professionals from India hired by American, European and Malaysian companies. So there goes my hope in finding some good looking rich Qatari men, hehehehe.   He said, the Qataris have too much money, so little to do. They just eat, sleep and shop, besides counting royalties and commissions from businesses run by foreigners under their names.   Even though Qatar is a relatively small country, only 50 miles wide and 100 miles from north to south (4,400 square miles of land), it is regarded as an economic, cultural, political, information and educational regional hub of the Middle East. Rich in oil and natural gas, Qatar is one of the wealthiest nations and emerging as the Arab world’s most revolutionary nation.   So, I assumed they must have so many fat Qataris per capita!  With extensive and high-speed development in infrastructure, education, politics, oil and gas and trade and finance, Qatar led the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in 2000, hosted the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Conference in 2001, and will be hosting the Asian Games in 2006.    UEM Group is fortunate to be part of a significant milestone in Qatar’s education sector development through this project.  With the construction of the College of Technology Bid Package #2, 3,200 Qatari students will be given unprecedented access to modern ideas and opportunities in areas of Engineering Technology, Information Technology, Business Management, Academic Preparation and Health Sciences provided by the State of Qatar, the Canadian Bureau of International Education and the College of North Atlantic.   Anyways, we had an early dinner at 5:00 p.m. at an Indian restaurant and had the best Briyani I have ever tasted, eaten with yogurt vegetables and pickles and chicken tandoori. By 6:00 p.m. we are already on our way to Doha Marriot to get ready our luggage so we leave by 7:00 p.m. to Doha Aiport.    Hotel concierge was late in collecting luggage, as wrong room number was conveyed by the reception.  As a result, I was about 15 minutes late from the scheduled hotel check out of 6:30 p.m. and Datuk Abu Hassan and Dato' Mohd Nor happened to be early by 15 minutes, to make matters worse. Murphy's Law - when it rains, it pours!   Prior to the trip, it was agreed that all accommodation and business centre costs be charged to Sulaihah’s corporate card and charges will be sorted out later. But she had to sort it out there and then, or was it a screw up by the hotel - either one. Bottom line is, we were late.  Two separate cars have been assigned for the airport transfer.  One car was provided for Datuk Abu Hassan, Dato’ Mohd Nor and Sulaihah. The other car was provided for Arul, Nor and me.  To save time, I think Sulaihah could have proceeded with hotel check out and settled the hotel bills, and arranged for Datuk Abu Hassan and Dato’ Mohd Nor to be chauffeured to the airport so they did not have to wait.    We finally boarded the flight at 10:30 p.m. as the flight was delayed. I sat in the same row of Indonesian maids, who were talking very loudly. After half an hour, I asked to be moved to another seat closer to Nor and Arul. I sat next to a Yemeni man, Riyadh Abbas, whom I became friends with over the 7 hours flight home to Kuala Lumpur.  Riyadh lives in Malaysia, anyways.  Wednesday, 25 June 2003  Upon arrival in KLIA at 10:45,a.m. I made sure that Nor and Arul's transportation arrangements are in order – arranged and paid for Nor's airport taxi and Arul’s  KLIA Express ticket, and sent him personally to Puduraya Bus Station where he boarded bus to Ipoh, Perak.  Mission accomplished - with a margin of error!  Epilogue .........  This is the first time for me in carrying out such assignments and I believe that I have done my best in carrying out my duties and we have achieved our main objective of getting a good and positive media coverage and in ensuring all assigned tasks were carried out.   While I did my best, and strive to get things right the first time, they must also allow an acceptable margin for human error and as practice makes perfect, this provides room for future improvement.   Neverthless, despite Dato' Mohd Nor making a big fuss about me being 15 minutes later than them, I am glad that the signing ceremony received good news coverage by the media, including Bernama, Business Times, Gulf Times. Business Times published our story on its front page with YBhg Datuk Abu Hassan Kendut’s picture displayed prominently. Gulf Times ran a half page story on a prominent page with picture of the exchanging of documents.  I have also received greetings / inquiries emails from media in Qatar from my media networking initiative, in view of future projects that UEM Group may be securing in Qatar and the Middle East region.

      Georgetown - The Deadly Junction - It is a T-Junction, located beside the Union High School, It Was said that if you ever drive across it late at night, your car will go out of control, & crash because there were many accidents happened there. some said that there is a tiny  unknown tree which looks like a lady carrying a child beside the road, they saw her figure & a child screaming,some old folks said she was once a "bomoh"(witch) & she kidnapped her  sister's son, somehow they never appear after being seen beside this "DEADLY JUNCTION".   Kuala Kangsar - Malay College Kuala Kangsar  - Said to be a former site of a Japanese occupation camp during WW2. Students sometimes awakened by something that stares down directly at them. A marching platoon can be heard in the field. The sounds of chains. A tree on campus which is right beside a lamppost where the light shines down on it. The shadow produced is that of a man hanging from the tree.- this may be urban legend.  A few though were conveniently historically 'situated' as they were old colonial admin buildings that were used by the Japanese during the Occupation in the 1940s where 'executions' would take place. Some of these buildings were the Victoria Institution (school), the Bukit Bintang Girls School (used to be methodist grounds,now demolished)   Kuala Kubu Bharu - Mara Junior Science College Kuala Kubu Bharu - In various parts of the building a white flying apparition has been seen.   Kuala Lumpur - Bukit(Hill) Tunku - A spooky place to be. Bukit (Hill) Tunku is actually one of the more elite residential areas in Kuala Lumpur. This place has many big and tall trees, and has this eerie feeling about it even at broad daylight and of course at night. It is said that a few years ago two youth embarked on a high speed motorcycle chase around the curvy roads of the area. One of the youth crashed at a dark stretch of the road, which is actually a very sharp corner. There have been claims about sightings of a young man riding a motorcycle at high speed, who mysteriously vanished in the dark.   Kuala Lumpur - Cheras - Poliklinik Cheras - Used to be a government hospital but it is being abandoned with no reason, been to the place before seems haunted and bizarre, rumors heard that there are still some dead patient that is loitering around the area.   Kuala Lumpur - Genting Highlands Resort - A famous hill-top resort and casino. Many people incurred gambling debts and committed suicide here. Some visitors leaving the hotel lobby reported seeing a man in red jump from the rooftop, just to disappear before he hits the ground. Certain rooms are not available for rent no matter how full the hotel was - those who have seen the inside reported that it was filled with old Chinese ghost wards. They would subsequently fall sick for days afterwards.   Kuala Lumpur - Highland Towers - A tragic event that will forever live in the memory of Malaysians. One of the 3 blocks of apartment at this place fell apart due to landslide and heavy downpour prior to that fateful day. And Highland Towers have become famous for claims of being a very haunted place. Voices of the dead can be heard at night and ghostly figures are said to have appeared at the scene. There are also a story about a taxi driver who picked up a woman passenger at the middle of the night and being asked to drop her at the place.She left a bag and the poor taxi driver found it to be full of blood!   Kuala Lumpur - Pudu Prison - Old prison that was abandoned after the area around it became  commercialized. Reports of a strange thin Indian man walking the prison hallways and disappearing around the corner.  Screams can be heard from the room where hangings take place. Certain areas such as specific cells and holding chambers were far colder than others. -  Update: They are turning this back into a prison (for low security prisoners) as no one will take it up for commercial property as it is too well known for the hauntings. There were plans to turn it into a hotel where you can stay a night at the cell of the most notorious criminals. Actually, the listing is wrong about hangings. The hangings do not take place at Pudu prison. Unless its self inflicted/murder. Official hangings are done outside Pudu. There were of course many in-prison acts of violence that led to deaths of inmates. Many drug addicts were known to be victims of violent criminals and so they were moved out into another prison elsewhere.   Kuala Lumpur - Victoria Institution - A very famous landmark in Kuala Lumpur, V.I. a boys school was a Japanese base during the occupation of Malaysia. Many British soldiers and locals were brutally tortured to death in the basement and some of the older buildings on the campus. It is said that not only are apparitions common in the day as well as the night, there have been many cases of spirits possessing students. The possessed boys would behave strangely, even violently, harming other students and teachers only to snap out of it a few hours later and remember nothing, even when they were forcibly restrained, their bruises would disappear when they returned to normal.   Perak - Ipoh - Tambun - Sighting of an old lady on the roadside while driving.   Perak - Ipoh - Tambun Inn - Lights reported to turn on and off and sounds of whispering.   Perak - Kellies Castle - sometimes door are opened themselves. lots of scary screaming  voices........   Puchong - Puchong House - Evil drawings on the walls. Some say the ghost of a woman who resided here before haunts it. Other than that, just stepping into the house is enough to keep you awake for months.   Selangor - Ampang - S.K (1) Kuala Ampang - Could hear taps in the toilet running by itself and sightings of a lady in white walking behind the school compound.

      (Story by an unknown writer)  My husband is a scientist by profession, I love him for his steady-being nature, and I love the warm feeling while lean against his broad shoulder.   Three years in the courtship and now, two years into marriage, I would have to admit, I am getting tired of it, the reasons of me loving him before has now transform into the cause of all the restlessness. I am a sentimental woman and extremely sensitive and exquisite when it comes to relationship and feelings, I yearn for romantic moments, as though a little boy yearning for candy.   And my husband, is just a contrast of me, his lack of sensitivity, and of all, inability of bringing romantic moments into our marriage has disheartened me about love.   One day, I finally decided to tell him my decision, that I want a divorce.   "Why?" he asked, shocking.   "I am tired, there aren't reasons for everything in the world" I answered.   He kept silent the whole night, seems to be in deep thoughts the whole night with cigarette lighted all the times.  My feeling of disappointment is getting intense, a man who can't even express his detainment, what else can I hope from him? And  finally he asked :" What can I do to change your mind?"   Somebody said it right, it's hard to change a person's personality, and I guess, I have started losing faith in him. Look deep into his eyes and I slowly answered : "Here is a question, if you can find the answer in my heart, I will change my mind, Let say,  I love a flower at a mountain cliff, and we both sure that the making you to pick the flower will cause death, will you do it for me?"   He said :" I will give you your answer tomorrow...."   My heart just sink by listening to his respond. The next morning, he was not around, and I saw a piece of paper with his  scratching writing, underneath a glass of warm milk, It goes....   Dear, "I would not pick that flower for you, but please allowed me to further explain the reasons " this first lines has already break my heart. I continue reading.   "You can only type with computer and always messed up the programs in the PC, and cries in front of screen, I have to saved my fingers so that I can help to restore the programs.  You always left the house key behind, I have to save my legs to rush home for opening the door for you.   You love traveling but always lose your way in a new city, I have to save my eyes to leads you the way.  You always has the cramp whenever your "good friend" approach every month, I have to save my palm so that I can calm the cramp at your tummy.  You like to stays indoor, and I worries that you will be infected by infantile autism.I have to save my mouth to tells you jokes and stories to cure your boredom.  You always stared at the computers, and that do no good to your eyes, I have to save my eyes so that when we grow older, I can help to clip your nails,and help to removed those annoying white hairs. I will hold your hand,stroll down the beach, enjoying the sunshine and the beautiful sands...tells you the colour of flowers, just like the glow on your young face...   Thus, my dear, before I am sure there are someone who loves you more than I do... I would not pick the flower, and die.. "   My tears drops on the letters, and blurred the ink of his hand writing..and I resume my reading... "And now, dear... you have finished reading my answer, if you are satisfied with these answers, please open the door of our house, I am standing there,with your favorite bread and fresh milk... I rush to pull open the door, and saw his anxious face, with his hand holding tight on the milk and bread....  Oh I am sure no one ever love me as much, and now I have decided to leave the flower alone...  That's life, or some said, love, when one is surrounded by love, the feeling of excitement fade away, and one tend to ignore the true love lies in between the peace and dullness. Love shows in any form, even a very little and corny form, it has never been a model, it could be the most incurious form.. . flowers, romantic moments is only the buckish formed on the surface of the relationship. Under all this, the pillar of truelove stands... and that's our life...   I hope everyone enjoy reading it... love, but not words win the arguments...   What's yours is yours even if u let it go What's not yours will never be yours even if u hold on     "Who Cares, Life is full of surprises!" Stubbornly different

      If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof overhead and a place to sleep ... you are richer than 75% of this world.  If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a dish someplace ... you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.  If you woke up this morning with more health than illness ... you are more blessed than the million who will not survive this week.  If you have never experienced the danger of battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation...you are ahead of 500 million people in the world.  If you can pray in mosque without fear of harassment, arrest, torture, or death ... you are more blessed than three billion people in the world.  If your parents are still alive and still married ... you are very rare.  If you hold up your head with a smile on your face and are truly thankful... you are blessed because the majority can, but most do not.  If you can read this message, you just received a double blessing in that someone was thinking of you, and furthermore, you are more blessed than over two billion people in the world that cannot read at all.

      Each of us has such a bank. Its name is TIME. Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it writes off, as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to good purpose. It carries over no balance. It allows no overdraft.  Each day it opens a new account for you. Each night it burns the remains of the day. If you fail to use the day's deposits, the loss is yours.  There is no going back. There is no drawing against the "tomorrow." You must live in the present on today's deposits. Invest it so as to get from it the utmost in health, happiness, and success! The clock is running. Make the most of today.   To realize the value of ONE YEAR, ask a student who failed a grade.  To realize the value of ONE MONTH, ask a mother who gave birth to a premature baby.  To realize the value of ONE WEEK, ask the editor of a weekly newspaper.  To realize the value of ONE HOUR, ask the lovers who! Are waiting to meet.  To realize the value of ONE MINUTE, ask a person who missed the train.  To realize the value of ONE-SECOND, ask a person who just avoided an accident.  To realize the value of ONE MILLISECOND, ask the person who won a silver medal in the Olympics.  Treasure every moment that you have! And treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time.  And remember that time waits for no one. Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That's why it's called the present!!!

      LESSON ONE ----------   A young executive was leaving the office at 6 p.m. when he found the CEO standing in front of a shredder with a piece of paper in his hand. "Listen," said the CEO, "this is a very sensitive and important document, and my secretary has left. Can you make this thing work?" "Certainly," said the young executive. He turned the machine on, inserted the paper, and pressed the start button. "Excellent, excellent!"  said the CEO as his paper disappeared inside the machine "I just need one copy."  Lesson learnt: Never, never assume that the BOSS knows everything.  =====================================================  LESSON TWO ----------  A crusty old man walks into a bank and says to the teller at the window: "I want to open a damn checking account." To which the astonished woman replies: "I beg your pardon, sir; I must have misunderstood you. What did you say?" "Listen up bitch! I said, I want to open a damn checking account right now!" "I'm very sorry sir, but we do not tolerate that kind of language in this bank."  Having said this, the teller leaves the window and goes over to the bank manager to tell him about her problem-customer. They both return and the manager asks the old geezer: "What seems to be the problem here?" "There's no damn problem, sonny," the elderly man says. "I just won 50 million bucks in the damn lottery and I want to open a damn checking account in this damn bank!"  "I see," says the manager thoughtfully. "And you're saying that this bitch here is giving you a hard time?"  Lesson Learnt: If you are RICH, you can get away with  almost anything.  *********************************************************  LESSON THREE ------------  An American and a Japanese were sitting on the plane on the way to LA when the American turned to the Japanese and asked, "What kind of " ---ese" are you?" The Japanese confused, replied, "Sorry but I don't understand what you mean "The American repeated, "What kind of ---ese are you?" Again, the Japanese was confused over the question. The American, now irritated, then yelled "What kind of ---ese are you... Are you a Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese etc......  "The Japanese then replied, "Oh, I am a Japanese."  A while later the Japanese turned to the American and asked what kind of '...key' was he. The American, frustrated, yelled, "What do you mean what kind of ' -key' am I ?!"  The Japanese said, "Are you a monkey, donkey or a Yankee ?"  Lesson: Never insult anyone.   ******************************************************************  LESSON FOUR -----------  There were these 4 guys, a Russian, a German, an American and a French, who found this small genie bottle. When they rubbed the bottle, a genie appears. Thankful that the 4 guys had released him out of the bottle, he said, "Next to you all are 4 swimming pools, I will give each of you a wish.  When you run towards the pool and jump, you shout what you want the pool of water to become, then your wish will come true." The French wanted to start.   He ran towards the pool, jumped and shouted "WINE". The pool immediately changed into a pool of wine, the Frenchman was so happy swimming and drinking from the pool. Next is the Russian's turn, he did the same and shouted, "VODKA" and immersed himself into a pool of vodka. The German was next and he jumped and shouted, "BEER". He was so contented with his beer pool. The last is the American. He was running towards the pool when suddenly he steps on a banana peel. He slipped towards the pool and shouted, "SHIT!!!....."  Lesson: Think twice before you say something, because  sometimes accidents do happen and wishes do come true.

      Three important and meaningful short stories for use in life   1) The Frogs A farmer came into town and asked the owner of a restaurant if he could use  a million frog legs. The restaurant owner was shocked and asked the man  where he could get so many frog legs!  The farmer replied,"There is a pond near my house that is full of frogs  ---millions of them. They all croak all night long and they are about to  make me crazy!" So the restaurant owner and the farmer made an agreement  that the farmer would deliver frogs to the restaurant, five hundred at a  time for the next several weeks.  The first week, the farmer returned to the restaurant looking rather  sheepish,with two scrawny little frogs. The restaurant owner said, "Well...  where are all the frogs?" The farmer said, "I was mistaken. There were only these two frogs in the pond. But they sure were  making a lot of noise!"  Next time you hear somebody criticizing or making fun of you, remember, it's  probably just a couple of noisy frogs. Also remember that problems always  seem bigger in the dark. Have you ever laid in your bed at night worrying about things which seem almost overwhelming like  a million frogs croaking? Chances are pretty good that when the morning  comes, and you take a closer look, you'll wonder what all the fuss was  about.  2) The Pretty Lady Once upon a time, a big monk and a little monk were travelling together.  They came to the bank of a river and found the bridge was damaged. They had  to wade across the river. There was a pretty lady who was stuck at the damaged bridge and couldn't cross the river. The big monk  offered to carry the pretty lady across the river on his back. The lady accepted.  The little monk was shocked by the move of the big monk."How can big  disciple brother carry a lady when we are supposed to avoid all intimacy  with females?" thought the little monk.  But he kept quiet. The big monk carried the lady across the river and the  small monk followed unhappily.  When they had crossed the river, the big monk let the lady down and they  parted ways with her.  All along the way for several miles, the little monk was very unhappy with  the act of the big monk. He was making up all kinds of accusations about the  big monk in his head. This got him madder and madder. But he still kept quiet. And the big monk had no inclination to  explain his situation.  Finally, at a rest point many hours later, the little monk could not stand  it any further, he burst out angrily at the big monk. "How can you claim  yourself a devout monk, when you seize the first opportunity to touch a  female, especially when she is very pretty? All your teachings to me make  you a big hypocrite."  The big monk looked surprised and said, "I had put down the pretty lady at  the river bank many hours ago, how come you are still carrying her along?"  This very old Chinese zen story reflects the thinking of many people today.  We encounter many unpleasant things in our life, they irritate us and they  make us angry. Sometimes, they cause us a lot of hurt, sometimes they cause  us to be bitter or jealous. But like the little monk, we are not willing to  let them go away. We keep on carrying the baggage of the "pretty lady" with us. We let them keep on  coming back to hurt us, make us angry, make us bitter and cause us a lot of  agony. Why? Simply because we are not willing to put down or let go of the  baggage of the "pretty lady". We should let go of the pretty lady  immediately after crossing the river, immediately after the unpleasant event is over. This will immediately remove all our agonies.  There is no need to be further hurt by the unpleasant event after it is over. It is just that simple  3) The Turtles A turtle family decided to go on a picnic. Turtles, being naturally slow  about things, took seven years to prepare for their outing. Finally the  turtle family left home looking for a suitable place for their outing.  During the second year of their journey they found a place ideal for them at  last! For about six months they cleaned up the area, unpacked the picnic  basket, and completed the arrangements. Then they discovered they had  forgotten the salt. A picnic without salt would be a disaster, they all  agreed.  After a lengthy discussion, the youngest turtle was chosen to retrieve the salt from home. Although he was the  fastest of the slow-moving turtles, the little turtle whined, cried, and  wobbled in his shell.  He agreed to go on one condition: that no one would eat until he returned.  The family consented and the little turtle left. Three years passed and the  little turtle had not returned. Five years...six years... then on the  seventh year of his absence, the oldest turtle could no longer contain his  hunger. He announced that he was going to eat and begun to unwrap a  sandwich. At that point the little turtle suddenly popped out from behind a tree shouting, "SEE! I knew  you wouldn't wait. Now I am not going to go get the salt."  Some of us waste our time waiting for people to live up to our expectations.  We lose track of what's the most important thing in our lives. We are so  concerned about what others are doing that we don't do anything ourselves.

      by Maya Angelou  When I was in my younger days, I weighed a few pounds less, I needn't hold my tummy into a belted dress. But now that I am older, I've set my body free; there's the comfort of elastic where once my waist would be. Inventor of those high-heeled shoes My feet have not forgiven; I have to wear a nine now, But used to wear a seven. And how about those pantyhose- They're sized by weight, you see, So how come when I put them on The crotch is at my knee? I need to wear these glasses  As the print's been getting smaller; Though my hair has turned to gray and my skin no longer fits, On the inside, I'm the same old me, It's the outside's changed a bit.  But, on a positive note...I've learned that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow.  I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three things: a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights.  I've learned that regardless of your relationship with your parents, you'll miss them when they're gone from your life.  I've learned that making a "living" is not the same thing as making a "life."  I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance.  I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both hands. You need to be able to throw something back.  I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart, I usually make the right decision. I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one. I've learned that every day you should reach out and touch someone. People love a warm hug, or just a friendly pat on the back.  I've learned that I still have a lot to learn.  I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.

      Seorang tukang air memiliki dua tempayan besar,masing-masing bergantung pada kedua hujung sebuah pikulan, yang dibawa menyilang pada bahunya. Satu dari tempayan itu retak, sedangkan tempayan yang satunya lagi tidak. Jika tempayan yang tidak retak itu selalu dapat membawa air penuh setelah perjalanan panjang dari mata air ke rumah majikannya, tempayan itu hanya dapat membawa air setengah penuh.  Selama dua tahun, hal ini terjadi setiap hari. Si tukang air hanya dapat membawa satu setengah tempayan air ke rumah majikannya. Tentu saja si tempayan yang tidak retak merasa bangga akan prestasinya, kerana dapat menunaikan tugasnya dengan sempurna. Namun si tempayan retak yang malang itu merasa malu sekali akan ketidaksempurnaannya dan merasa sedih sebab ia hanya dapat memberikan setengah dari jumlah yang seharusnya dapat diberikannnya.  Setelah dua tahun tertekan oleh kegagalan pahit ini, tempayan retak itu berkata kepada si tukang air, "Saya sungguh malu pada diri saya sendiri, dan saya ingin mohon maaf kepadamu." "Kenapa?" tanya si tukang air, "Kenapa kamu merasa malu?" "Saya hanya mampu, selama dua tahun ini, membawa setengah jumlah air dari yang seharusnya dapat saya bawa kerana adanya retakan pada sisi saya telah membuat air yang saya bawa bocor sepanjang jalan menuju rumah majikan kita. Kerana cacatku itu, saya telah membuatmu rugi." kata tempayan itu.   Si tukang air merasa kasihan pada si tempayan retak,dan dalam belas kasihannya, ia berkata, "Jika kita kembali ke rumah majikan besok, aku ingin kamu memerhatikan bunga-bunga indah di sepanjang jalan." Benar, ketika mereka naik ke bukit, si tempayan retakmemerhatikan dan baru menyedari bahwa ada bunga-bunga indah di sepanjang sisi jalan, dan itu membuatnya sedikit terhibur. Namun pada akhir perjalanan, ia kembali sedih kerana separuh air yang dibawanya telah bocor, dan kembali tempayan retak itu meminta maaf pada si tukang air atas kegagalannya.  Si tukang air berkata kepada tempayan itu, "Apakah kamu memerhatikan adanya bunga-bunga di sepanjang jalan si sisimu tapi tidak ada bunga di sepanjang jalan di sisi tempayan yang lain yang tidak retak itu. Itu kerana aku selalu menyedari akan cacatmu dan aku memanfaatkannya. Aku telah menanam benih-benih bunga di sepanjang jalan di sisimu, dan setiap hari jika kita berjalan pulang dari mata air, kamu mengairi benih-benih itu. Selama dua tahun ini aku telah dapat memetik bunga-bunga indah itu untuk menghias meja majikan kita. Tanpa kamu sebagaimana kamu ada, majikan kita tak akan dapat menghias Rumahnya seindah sekarang."  Setiap dari kita memiliki cacat dan kekurangan kita sendiri. Kita semua adalah tempayan retak. Namun jika kita mau, Tuhan akan menggunakan kekurangan kita untuk menghias-Nya. Di mata Tuhan yang bijaksana, tak ada yang terbuang percuma. Jangan takut akan kekurangan kita. Kenalilah kelemahan kita. Ketahuilah, di dalam kelemahan kita, kita menemui kekuatan kita.

      Five (5) lessons to make you think about the way we treat people.  1 - First Important Lesson - Cleaning Lady.  During my second month of college, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions until I read the last one: "What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?"  Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s, but how would I know her name? I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade.  "Absolutely," said the professor. "In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say "hello".  I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.   2. - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain   One night, at 11:30 p.m., an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rainstorm. Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxicab.  She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A special note was attached... It read: "Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away. God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others."  Sincerely, Mrs. Nat King Cole.   3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve.  In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10-year-old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him. "How much is an ice cream sundae?" he asked.  "Fifty cents," replied the waitress.   The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it.   "Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?" he inquired. By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient.   "Thirty-five cents," she brusquely replied.   The little boy again counted his coins. "I'll have the plain ice cream," he said.   The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. there, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies... You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip.   4 - Fourth Important Lesson. The obstacle in Our Path.  In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way.  Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand!  Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.   5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts.  Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare & serious disease. Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness.  The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, "Yes I'll do it if it will save her." As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheek.   Then his face grew pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice, "Will I start to die right away".  Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.

      Today.....  Today before you think of saying an unkind word Think of someone who cant speak Before you complain about the taste of your food Think of someone who has nothing to eat  Before you complain about your husband or wife Think of someone who's crying out to God for a companion Today before you complain about life Think of someone who went too early to heaven  Before you complain about your children Think of someone who desires children but they're barren Before you argue about your dirty house someone didn't clean or sweep Think of the people who are living in the streets  Before whining about the distance you drive Think of someone who walks the same distance with their feet And when you are tired and complain about your job Think of the unemployed, the disabled and those who wished they had your job  But before you think of pointing the finger or condemning another Remember that not one of us are without sin and we all answer to one maker And when depressing thoughts seem to get you down Put a smile on your face and thank God you're alive and still around  Life is a gift Live it... Enjoy it... Celebrate it... And fulfill it.

      To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.  -RALPH WALDO EMERSON-

      You think you know the tortise and hare story? read on.  The Tortoise and the Hare  Once upon a time a tortoise and a hare had an argument about who was faster. They decided to settle the argument with a race. They agreed on a route and started off the race.  The hare shot ahead and ran briskly for some time. Then seeing that he was far ahead of the tortoise, he thought he'd sit under a tree for some time and relax before continuing the race.  He sat under the tree and soon fell asleep. The tortoise plodding on overtook him and soon finished the race, emerging as the undisputed champ. The hare woke up and realized that he'd lost the race.   The moral of the story is that slow and steady wins the race.  This is the version of the story that we've all grown up with. But then recently, someone told me a more interesting version of this story. It continues.   The hare was disappointed at losing the race and he did some soul-searching. He realized that he'd lost the race only because he had been overconfident, careless and lax. If he had not taken things for granted, there's no way the tortoise could have beaten him. So he challenged the tortoise to another race. The tortoise agreed.   This time, the hare went all out and ran without stopping from start to finish. He won by several miles. The moral of the story? Fast and consistent will always beat the slow and steady. If you have two people in your organization, one slow, methodical and reliable, and the other fast and still reliable at what he does, the fast and reliable chap will consistently climb the organizational ladder faster than the slow, methodical chap. It's good to be slow and steady; but it's better to be fast and reliable.  But the story doesn't end here. The tortoise did some thinking this time, and realized that there's no way he can beat the hare in a race the way it was currently formatted. He thought for a while, and then challenged the hare to another race, but on a slightly different route.  The hare agreed. They started off. In keeping with his self-made commitment to be consistently fast, the hare took off and ran at top speed until he came to a broad river. The finishing line was a couple of kilometers on the other side of the river.  The hare sat there wondering what to do. In the meantime the tortoise trundled along, got into the river, swam to the opposite bank, continued walking and finished the race. The moral of the story? First identify your core competency and then change the playing field to suit your core competency.  The story still hasn't ended.  The hare and the tortoise, by this time, had become pretty good friends and they did some thinking together. Both realized that the last race could have been run much better. So they decided to do the last race again, but to run as a team this time. They started off, and this time the hare carried the tortoise till the riverbank. There, the tortoise took over and swam across with the hare on his back. On the opposite bank, the hare again carried the tortoise and they reached the finishing line together. They both felt a greater sense of satisfaction than they'd felt earlier.  The moral of the story? It's good to be individually brilliant and to have strong core competencies; but unless you're able to work in a team and harness each other's core competencies, you'll always perform below par because there will always be situations at which you'll do poorly and someone else does well.  Teamwork is mainly about situational leadership, letting the person with the relevant core competency for a situation take leadership.   There are more lessons to be learnt from this story. Note that neither the hare nor the tortoise gave up after failures. The hare decided to work harder and put in more effort after his failure.  The tortoise changed his strategy because he was already working as hard as he could. In life, when faced with failure, sometimes it is appropriate to work harder and put in more effort. Sometimes it is appropriate to change strategy and try something different. And sometimes it is appropriate to do both.  The hare and the tortoise also learnt another vital lesson. When we stop competing against a rival and instead start competing against the situation, we perform far better.  When Roberto Goizueta took over as CEO of Coca-Cola in the 1980s, he was faced with intense competition from Pepsi that was eating into Coke's growth. His executives were Pepsi-focussed and intent on increasing market share 0.1 per cent a time. Goizueta decided to stop competing against Pepsi and instead compete against the situation of 0.1 per cent growth. He asked his executives what was the average fluid intake of an American per day? The answer was 14 ounces. What was Coke's share of that? Two ounces. Goizueta said Coke needed a larger share of that market.  The competition wasn't Pepsi. It was the water, tea, coffee, milk and fruit juices that went into the remaining 12 ounces. The public should reach for a Coke whenever they felt like drinking something.  To this end, Coke put up vending machines at every street corner. Sales took a Quantum jump and Pepsi has never quite caught up since. To sum up, the story of the hare and tortoise teaches us many things. Chief among them are that fast and consistent will always beat slow and steady; work to your competencies; pooling resources and working as a team will always beat individual performers; never give up when faced with failure; and finally, compete against the situation-not against a rival.

      By: Chong See Ming  Journaling has long been recommended as a beneficial tool in self awareness and understanding. Journaling has been said to nurture one's spirituality and build inroads into our unconscious minds.  Journal advocates say that journaling is the perfect way to take inventory of ourselves and our feelings, resolve conflicts, make decisions and bring clarity to our lives as well as to record our personal spiritual journey.  For me, it's always been a balm for my soul. As I record my thoughts, dreams, desires and feelings, my self-knowledge increases. Call it mental detoxification, mindful spring-cleaning, or any other terms, journaling for me is a form of meditation that de-clutters any mental confusion.Let's explore in detail some of the key advantages of keeping a journal:-  Journaling is an affordable method of self-therapy  A journal doesn't have to be an expensive hard-cover, bounded notebook with a built-in lock. I know some people who use thin school exercise books costing only 80 cents each, but as thoughts flow, the desired effect will still be the same. If you are technology-savvy, an online blog will cost next to nothing. Check out Blogger for free blogging tools. (And read Najah Nasseri's article on Blogging, this issue of ProDigy)  Journaling helps us solve problems  No matter how cliché is seems - the phrase "The answer lies within us" has been historically proven. Through journaling, we can start sifting through the whirlpools of our minds to find answers to issues that bother us.  Journaling helps us to excavate our authentic selves  In the noise of everyday world, we often prevented from listening to our inner voices. We are "polished" by what our family, friends and society demands of us whereby we gradually adopt mannerisms and values that may contradict who we were originally. The danger of losing ourselves this way is we may stop living the life we crave and live our lives for others. John Holt, an American educator described this problem exactly when he wrote in his book, Never Too Late: My Musical Life Story, " ...it is not easy to find out what we like or want, when all our lives, other people work trying not just to make us do what they want, but to make us think that we want to do it."  Journaling helps us listen to ourselves  Writing a journal may re-orientate us on the journey of self-discovery as it is a good way to let our inner voice comes through the hustle and bustle of our surroundings.  Putting our thoughts on paper could also help uncover the hidden mental obstacles which are stunting our growth, and help us become more aware of the negativity in our thoughts and resolve them.  Journaling is a healthy way to release pent-up emotions  In her book, Write Away, A Journal Writing Tool Kit, Eldonna Bouton asks "Think about how often you have been asked how you were and you automatically responded with "Fine." How many times were you really not fine, or worse, but couldn't really say how you were really feeling?"  A blank page is a safe place to dump anger and frustrations without hurting anyone. Releasing our feelings to the page may actually help them subside. We can use the journaling process to help us work through stressful events without the fear of social consequences, especially things that we don't want to discuss with friends or family.  Ultimately, this connection can reduce stress and keeps us healthy.  Journaling is an investment in ourselves  It does not require any skill or talent, just a willingness to write when we feel like it. We benefit from the self-expression and increased awareness of our thoughts and feelings.  In this way, journaling complements our life-long learning process as we document our experiences and learn as much as we can from them.  You might say I've kept a diary before but nothing came out of it. Well, unlike the diary of the past, where you dutifully recorded the events of the day, be clear that this new journal's purpose is to capture emotions and documenting feeling and sentiments. By capturing your thoughts on paper, you open communications links between your subconscious mind and your conscious mind, allowing your subconscious to emerge. And it might just help you solve the mystery of who you really are. Try it.  5 Quick Tips for Journal Keeping Commitment Keep your journal with you in your bag or somewhere conspicuous where you will always see it and be reminded. Block 10 minutes or more everyday as writing time.  The right tools Having the right tools can make the experience more enjoyable. Use your favourite pen and for longevity, write on acid-free, hand-made paper.  Date Date every entry as far as possible, make a note of the time, place and even weather. You will find these information useful in the future.  Find a support group Get your close friends to remind you to write in it. Get on to a jounal-writing mailing list - There's plenty on Yahoo Groups.  Be true to yourself Remember the best journal is one that is entirely YOU - so create your own rules, whatever that strikes your fancy.

      By David Bolchover      When Sir Alex Ferguson leads his soccer team into the FA Cup Final in Cardiff on Saturday, it will mark the end of a challenging season both on and off the pitch for the manager of Manchester United. The tensions between Sir Alex and John Magnier, the Irish racing tycoon and one of the club's big shareholders, have highlighted Sir Alex's biggest challenge. He may be king inside his own little fiefdom - the cosy, artificial world of soccer - but this time round he is not up against young lads whom he can order around as he likes. In his confrontation with Mr Magnier, he is face to face with an experienced player in the tough world of business. In this respect, Sir Alex has stepped into the really big league.        Nevertheless, top soccer managers and players deserve better regard from the outside world than they often receive. Whatever the rights and wrongs of his quarrel with Mr Magnier, Sir Alex has been top of the tree in a hugely competitive and open meritocracy in which success shows and failure is cruelly exposed. If only business were more like the perfect market that is soccer. If only talent, determination and performance meant everything and flattery, nepotism and image counted for nothing.     The experiences of Jason and Darren Ferguson, two of Sir Alex's sons, starkly illustrate the gulf between soccer and business. Jason's career as a soccer agent has undoubtedly been helped by the fact that his father is such a big figure in the industry. The very name of Ferguson carries weight and credibility in British sport - and brings with it good connections. That is business.     Now wind the clock back to the Manchester United career of Darren Ferguson, who left the club just over a decade ago. He was a decent player, but having his father as manager could not disguise the fact that he was not good enough for a team with designs on European domination. He is now playing for Wrexham, a lower division team. That is soccer. A good name and a connection are not enough.     No industry is more meritocratic and yet the consensus seems to be that top soccer players are overpaid. For the best players, though, $140,000 a week is not so ridiculous. First, they provide entertainment for millions. Second, they have an extremely rare talent that is visible and measurable which the market is willing to pay for. In banking and broking , plenty of traders earn vast salaries. Now that is ridiculous. You could train any one of thousands of reasonably bright 18-year-olds with the gift of the gab and a capacity for hard work to do their job. But how many youngsters are potentially as good as Thierry Henry at soccer?     Sir Alex - and for that matter any other great soccer manager - devote their lives to getting the best out of others and are hugely and obviously successful at it. If only business had more managers like these men it would contribute greatly to a country's overall productivity. According to a recent Gallup survey, more than 80 per cent of British workers lack commitment to their jobs and most blame poor management for their low level of motivation.     If you want inspirational leaders, do not look to chief executives. They are mostly just company men who played a canny political game and got a few breaks. Go to the dugout at the top soccer clubs instead. If you want to feel jealous about people who are lucky enough to earn a huge salary, go to Hollywood or Wall Street. Top soccer players do not need the right school, influential fathers, well-connected publicity agents or the luck of being in the right place at the right time. They got their slice of fortune on the day they were born. It is called sublime talent.     The writer, co-author of 'The 90-Minute Manager: Lessons from the Sharp End of Management', is a consultant on management and leadership

      There once was very poor man living in a village who had a very fine horse. So fine, in fact, that the lord of the castle wanted to buy it. But the old man always refused. "To me this horse is not merely an animal. He's a friend. How could I sell you my friend?"  One morning he went to the stable and found his horse gone. All the villagers said, "We told you! You should have sold your horse. Now he's been stolen instead. What terrible luck."  "Bad luck or good luck," the old man said. "Who can say?" Everyone laughed at him.  But 15 days later the horse returned, followed by a whole herd of wild horses. He had escaped from the stable, courted a young mare, and returned with the rest of the herd following behind!  "What luck!" the villagers cried. The old man and his son began training the wild horses. But a week later the man's son broke his leg trying to train one of the horses.  "Bad luck," said his friends. "What are you going to do now without your son to help you? You who are already so poor."  "Bad luck, good luck, who can say?" the old man replied.  A few days later an army belonging to the lord of the land passed through the village and forced all the young men to become soldiers.  All ... except the old man's son, because of his broken leg.  "How lucky you are," the villagers cried. "All our children are gone to war, but you've been able to keep your son. Our sons will probably be killed ..."  The old man replied, "Bad luck, good luck... who can say?"  The future comes to us in bits and pieces. We never know what lies in store for us. But if you always maintain a positive attitude the doors of chance remain open, and you will be a happier person.

You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip.   4 - Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path  In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock.  Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way.  Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway.  The peasant learned what many of us never understand.  Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.    5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts  Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness.  The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, "Yes, I'll do it if it will save her." As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheek. Then his face grew pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice, "Will I start to die right away?"  Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her. You see, after all, understanding and attitude, are everything.

      (Contributed by Jida Mohamed)  When things in your life seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in a day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar...and the coffee.  A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.  So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.  The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with a unanimous "yes."  The professor then produced two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed.  "Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, " I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things-your God, family, your children, your health, your friends, and your favorite passions-things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, and your car. The sand is everything else-the small stuff.  "If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups Take your partner out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal."  Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand."  One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented.  The professor smiled. "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend."

      By Joyce Stark   Even as a kid my cousin Andrea always had big dreams! When we talked about being teachers or secretaries, Andrea talked of being a movie star. When we dreamed of going to the Mediterranean on holiday, Andrea dreamed of the Caribbean! (A long way from Scotland!)   As we grew up, she was not the prettiest of us, yet she had the most boyfriends. She was a little overweight and not that tall. But Andrea sparkled, both physically and mentally, and young men seemed to find that attractive.  Once on a double date, I marveled at her because she never had one moment's self-doubt or of feeling self-conscious. Because of this, she had the ability to say exactly what she was feeling; she made it seem like you were sharing something very personal with her.  It wasn't a surprise when she came in and announced, "Well, I am off to Rome to work as a nanny!" We all knew that Andrea had long ago decided she was in love with Rome and always said that is where she wanted to live.  She openly told us, "I am convinced I will meet this gorgeous Italian prince and we will fall madly in love!"  We laughed at that, but were all sad to see her go. She kind of  spread light around her and it was all much duller when she left.  Andrea arrived in Rome and settled in with the family for whom she was to be the nanny. They gave her a little apartment, and she already spoke Italian having always known she would need to use it!  Andrea took her young charge out a fair bit, to the Coliseum, the Spanish Steps, but mostly they went to the Trevi Fountain. "To anyone who has never seen it," she wrote to us, "you think of a little fountain in a square. It is huge, like a giant monument with water; it is breathtaking and beautiful."  She told us that you throw one coin in the fountain to return to Rome, two coins to find true love. "I have spent a fortune. I throw two coins in every time I pass, but it is an investment, I know it will work!" We laughed at that letter; same old Andrea, still the same big dreams!  One beautiful, sunny Roman morning, Andrea took Pierre Luigi out early, and they came to the Trevi Fountain. Andrea could not pass it by without throwing in her two coins, so they went down the steps and she threw in her coins.  She glanced up and two very handsome young men were watching her. The taller of the two asked her, "You weesh to return very much, eef you throw in two coins no?"  Andrea looked at this gorgeous young man, his hair a light gold  brown, but his face somehow very Italian. "One is to return to Rome, two is for love!"  They both smiled and walked over to her, and the one who had spoken introduced himself. Marcello continued to study her smiling as he asked, "So you want to find true love, here on your vacation?"  "I live in Rome. I love Rome and I have always dreamed of falling in love with someone here. I am sure it will happen," she beamed at him. He kept smiling at her and asked where she came from, and the four of them ended up having coffee together in a little café.  Whatever she said at that first meeting, he seemed to be really taken with her and asked if she would go out with him.  Andrea met Marcello the next evening and asked him what he did for a living. It turned out that he played for Roma FC, the football team. Not only did he play for them, he was one of their star players. Andrea's Marcello was a very famous and much admired young man throughout Italy because he played for the national side as well.  When she wrote and told us about him and sent photographs, we agreed with how gorgeous he was. My younger sister Bertha said that she had read about him and that he was usually with some tall, long-legged blonde model or something. It would have made the rest of us wonder what he could see in someone ordinary like us. Andrea never gave that a second thought; she was already nuts about him and fully expected him to be nuts about her!  The thing was, amazingly, he was nuts about her. She wrote and told us that she saw him nearly every day, she had met his family. Then that he wanted her to give up her work and live with him in his beautiful villa high up in the hills that surround Rome. Finally we flew over to visit her, and lying at the side of his huge swimming pool, surrounded by hills and the distant tops of the buildings of Rome, she beamed at us. I asked her, "So is Marcello the Italian prince you always dreamed of?"  "Oh yes, Joyce, and more, he has asked me to marry him!"  When we met him, it took us all of five minutes to realize he was not just in love with Andrea, but he adored her. He smiled every time his eyes rested on her. "There is no one like her," he told us. "She is so full of effervescence; she is like a bottle of champagne and I could not go back to drinking wine. She drifts off on flights of fancy, and I am running behind trying to find wings to fly with her. I love her very much."  They have been married for fifteen years and have three kids. She has seen a fair bit of the world, like she somehow always knew she would. Mainly though, she lives in her beautiful house with her gorgeous Italian.  I said to her one day about all her dreams coming true and she  laughed. "You have to be determined to achieve your dreams, like throwing two coins in the fountain every time you pass, to make sure they come true!"

      One night there was a woman at the airport who had to wait for several hours before catching her next flight. While she waited she bought a book and pack of biscuits to spend the time. She looked for a place to sit and waited. She was deep into her book, when suddenly she realized that there was a young man sitting next to her who was stretching his hand,with no concern whatsoever, and grabbing the pack of cookies lying between them.    He started to eat them one by one. Not wanting to make a fuss about it she decided to ignore him. The woman, slightly bothered, ate the cookies and watched the clock, while the young and shameless thief of biscuits was also finishing them. The woman started to get really angry at this point and thought "If I wasn't such a good and educated person, I would have given this daring man a black eye by now." Every time she ate a biscuit, he had one too. The dialogue between their eyes continued and when only one biscuit was left, she wondered what was he going to do. Softly and with a nervous smile, the young man grabbed the last biscuit and broke it in two. He offered one half to the woman while he ate the other half. Briskly she took the biscuit and thought, "What an insolent man! How uneducated! He didn't even thank me!".   She had never met anybody so fresh and sighed. Relieved to hear her flight announced. She grabbed her bags and went towards the boarding gate refusing to look back to where that insolent thief was seated. After boarding the plane and nicely seated, she looked for her book which was nearly finished by now. While looking into her bag she was totally surprised to find her pack of biscuits nearly intact. If my biscuits are here, she thought feeling terribly, those others were his and he tried to share them with me.    Too late to apologize to the young man, she realized with pain, that it was her who had been insolent, uneducated and a thief, and not him.   How many times in our lives, had we known with certainty that something happened in a certain way, only to discover later that it wasn't true? How many times has our lack of trust within us made us judge other people unfairly with our conceited ideas, often far away from reality. That is why we have to think twice before we judge others. Let's always give others the benefit of the doubt before we think badly of them.

      (Contributed by Yong Soo Heong)  In 1962, four nervous young musicians played their first record audition for the executives of the Decca recording Company. The executives were not impressed. While turning down this group of musicians, one executive said,"We don't like their sound. Groups of guitars are on the way out."  The group was called The Beatles.  ***********  In 1944, Emmeline Snively, director of the Blue Book Modelling Agency, told modelling hopeful Norma Jean Baker, "You'd better learn secretarial work or else get married."  She went on and became Marilyn Monroe.  *************  In 1954, Jimmy Denny, manager of the Grand Ole Opry, fired a singer after one performance. He told him, "You ain't goin' nowhere....son. You ought to go back to drivin' a truck. "  He went on to become the most popular singer in America named Elvis Presley.  **************  When Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876, it did not ring off the hook with calls from potential backers. After making a demonstration call, President Rutherford Hayes said,"That's an amazing invention, but who would ever want to use one of them?"  ****************  When Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, he tried over 2000 experiments before he got it to work. A young reporter asked him how it felt to fail so many times. He said, "I never failed once. I invented the light bulb. It just happened to be a 2000-step process."  *****************  In the 1940s, another young inventor named Chester Carlson took his idea to 20 corporations, including some of the biggest in the country. They all turned him down. In 1947 - after seven long years of rejections! He finally got a tiny company in Rochester, New York, the Haloid company, to purchase the rights to his invention an electrostatic paper-copying process.  Haloid became Xerox Corporation we know today.  *******************  Wilma Rudolph was the 20th of 22 children. She was born prematurely and her survival was doubtful. When she was 4 years old, she contacted double pneumonia and scarlet fever, which left her with a paralysed left leg. At age 9, she removed the metal leg brace she had been dependent on and began to walk without it. By 13 she had developed a rhythmic walk, which doctors said was a miracle. That same year she decided to become a runner. She entered a race and came in last. For the next few years every race she entered, she came in last. Everyone told her to quit, but she kept on running. One day she actually won a race. And then another. From then on she won every race she entered.  Eventually this little girl, who was told she would never walk again, went on to win three Olympic gold medals.  **********************  The moral of the above stories:  Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experiences of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, vision cleared, ambition inspired and success achieved.  You gain strength, experience and confidence by every experience where you really stop to look fear in the face....  You must do the thing you cannot do.  And remember, the finest steel gets sent through the hottest furnace.  A winner is not one who never fails, but one who NEVER QUITS!  In LIFE, remember that you pass this way only once!  Let's live life to the fullest and give it our extreme best... have a blissful life...

      (Do you know geography?)  One day, a professor was conducting a study at sea. He went out to sea in a 'sampan' with an oarsman. The oarsman job is to row the 'sampan'. The oarsman was an old and quiet man.  This was fine with the professor as he did not want any disturbance while he did his work.  For many hours, the professor examined water specimens from the sea and wrote down notes in his book. The oarsman looked up to the sky and thought to himself, "Hmm...It looks like it's going to rain".  Finally, when the professor had completed his work, he said, "Okay, let's get back to the shore". Only during the journey back did the professor speak to the oarsman.  "How long have you been rowing boats?" asked the professor.  "Almost all my life", replied the oarsman.  "Your whole life? So you don't know anything else besides rowing boats?" asked the professor.  The oarsman just shook his head from side to side.  "Do you know geography?" asked the professor. The oarsman shook his head quietly.  "In that case, you have lost 25 percent of your life,"said the professor.  "Do you know biology?" The oarsman shook his head. "You poor soul. You have lost 50 percent of your life. Do you know physics?" Again, the oarsman simply shook his head.  "How pitiful, you have lost 75 percent of your life then, you are so unfortunate; you don't know anything.  You have wasted your whole life just rowing boats," said the professor arrogantly. The oarsman just kept quiet.  A few minutes later, it started to rain. Suddenly a huge wave swept the 'sampan' and overturned it.  The professor and the oarsman were thrown into the sea.  Now, the oarsman asked the professor, "By the way, do you know how to swim?". The professor shook his head.  "In that case, you have lost 100 percent of your life!!," cried the oarsman as he swam to the shore.  THE END  The moral of this story is: It is no use having a high I.Q. or intelligence, if you do not know the more important things in life.  Someone may seem stupid in something that has nothing to do with his career or life. But he is a master in his line of work.  So, do not look down on others just because they seem ignorant or stupid, because they may in fact be more successful than us.

      BY GARY RYAN BLAIR  An increasing worldwide fear is that we will one day face the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons include biological, chemical, nuclear and radiological devices, and range from the silent threat of a poison gas attack to a cataclysmic nuclear explosion.   Those who would launch such attacks know many could die, but their fundamental motive is to strike psychological fear and panic into society. Of course this works with devastating effectiveness.   From a performance standpoint there is a much more pervasive, and perhaps, a much more devastating form of weapons of mass destruction that we should concern ourselves with.  These REAL weapons of mass destruction have killed more dreams, ideas, careers, marriages and lives than any Scud Missile ever could.   These weapons are self-inflicted acts of sabotage that people have chosen to embrace and perpetuate.   These weapons are the silent, slow, gradual killers of performance that have caused millions of people in the past, and which will cause millions of people in the future to go to their graves with their hopes, dreams, and passions still inside them.   The REAL Weapons of Mass Destruction  Excuses  Insecurity  Self-Pity  Anger  Lack of Integrity  Inconsistency  Apathy  Lying  Sarcasms  Ambiguity  Procrastination  Self-Doubt  Uncertainty  Laziness  Fear  Worry  Timidity  Ingratitude    Much like an addiction to chocolate, the continuation of these bad habits is like having an addiction to weapons of mass destruction.   For those who think self-discipline and the enforcement of accountability is hard. I suggest you brace yourself for massive regret in 30 years!   I propose a far different view on the weapons of mass destruction. A far more positive, self- imposed form of psychological warfare called weapons of mass production.   These weapons are possessed by all high achievers and are designed to help you construct the winning attitude required to remain competitive amidst the current storm of opportunity and chaos.   The REAL Weapons of Mass Production  Focus   Ambition   Courage    Accountability  Consistency   Gratitude    Boldness   Decisiveness   Commitment   Responsibility  Confidence  Initiative  Discipline  Follow through  Character  Love  Enthusiasm  Integrity    These weapons of mass production are available for anyone who consciously and willfully chooses them. These weapons will produce hard, tangible, massive results and will have far more to do with your success than any factor in your life.   Success is a case study in savvy self-management -- a life filled with cutting-edge ideas, rigorous accountability, and relentless attention to detail. A successful life is a model from which every person can learn.   Be unreasonable and adopt these weapons of mass production.  Massive success requires being both insanely passionate about living up to your absolute best and to a certain extent obsessive about how you do that.   Everything Counts

      By Patricia Fripp   It was a sunny Saturday afternoon in Oklahoma City. My friend and proud father Bobby Lewis was taking his two little boys to play miniature golf. He walked up to the fellow at the ticket counter and said, "How much is it to get in?"  The young man replied, "$3.00 for you and $3.00 for any kid who is older than six. We let them in free if they are six or younger. How old are they?"  Bobby replied, "The lawyer's three and the doctor is seven, so I guess I owe you $6.00."  The man at the ticket counter said, "Hey, Mister, did you just win the lottery or something? You could have saved yourself three bucks. You could have told me that the older one was six; I wouldn't have known the difference." Bobby replied, "Yes, that may be true, but the kids would have known the difference."  As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Who you are speaks so loudly I can't hear what you're saying." In challenging times when ethics are more important than ever before, make sure you set a good example for everyone you work and live with.

      By Anthony Robbins  Something to ponder on for the day......  Success- "Knowing the right people," "being in the right place at the right time," and " using the right tools" -by Anthony Robbins.  Your career is not everything; your life is. But then, What is life without a career or a career without a life?  1. You are always on your own. Even if you work for a big company, you will always be on your own. Companies aren't people. They're things and they don't have feelings. If you are excepting the company to "take care of you" or "do the right thing", you'll be often desappointed.There are no strong bonds in a company. No one cares more about your career than you do. Remember that, and don't expect the company to take care of you.  2. Certain jobs fit certain people best. You do have special gifts that fit you for seom, disqualify you for others. Take time to assess your skills, temperament and aptitude in depth.  3. Careeres are short-term. Your present job can end anytime, even if you won the company! Therefore, think shot term. Don't take your presend career for granted. Someone once described a consultant as a person who wakes up every morning unemployed. You should feel the same way. Wake up every morning feeling unemployed so that you'll appreciate your present job more and figure out what you're going to do next. Always have a "Plan B." (No kidding!)  4. It's more important to be a "people person" than an "achievement- oriented person" who always win at the cost of others. People sills are more important than techinical skills. Even in techincal jobs, you have to deal with someone. The average performer who are easier to get along with last longer in his job.  4. What you accomplish today will be your calling card tomorrow. Your accomplishments will determine your marketability. In marketing yourself, it's the results that count. A soccer forward who scored in every game is easier to market than one who doesn't. So make sure you're contributing something substantial and measurable every day. And make sure you keep a written record of your result, in case you forget!  6. If you lose your job, 80% of your marketing for a new position is already done. That's right. Your reputation, results, accompishements, people skills, contributions, friendships are all a matter of record. If you've been a contributor, if you've been kind to others and easy-to-work-with, you'll be in better demand. If not, you won't. Nodoby can create friendship for you if you haven't created it for yourself.  7. Changing fields, industries, and functional specialities is difficult. The more difficult it is, the bigger the change will be. Therefore, choose your career path carefully. As management expert Peter Drucker says, "The best wat to predict the furute is to plan it."  8. It you're tired or laid off, don't sue your former employer. Ask yourself why you didn't see it coming; or if you did see it soming. Ask yourself why you didn't do something about it. Figure out your part in causing the problem. Then set about creating a new, better life for yourself. There is a better life in your future.  9. Don't stay in a job you hate. Hating your job can kill you.  10. Success is difficult. If success were easy, everyone would be successful.  11. There's a special place for everyone. You can create the kind of future you want.  12. the workplace is dun and challenging. It can also be cruel and heartless. It rewards effort and planning, but tends to punish indifference and lask of preparation. Those who don't manage their careers, who just let things happen- often end up in painful, dead-end jobs and lifestyles.  13. You are in full control of your own future. No one can deny you a happy life if you decide to plan it and work for it. No one can stop you from becoming successful, but yourself.  14. It's never too late for a new beginning.  15. Align yourself with winners. Hang around with winners. Success really does rub off from others.  16. "If you keep doing what you always been doing, you're going to get what you've always gotten."

      Something beautiful I'd like to share...   Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there to serve some sort of purpose, to teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to be.    You never know who these people may be but when you lock eyes with them, you know at that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way.   Sometimes things that happen to you may seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you will realize that without overcoming these obstacles you would never have realized your full strength and willpower.  Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness even sheer stupidity.....it all occurs to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere, safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless.  The people you meet affect your life. The successes and downfalls that you experience can help shape who you are. The bad experiences can be learned from (in fact, they are probably the most poignant and important ones).  If someone hurts or betrays you or breaks your heart, do forgive them because they have taught you the lesson on trust and the importance of being cautious to whom you open your heart to.  If someone loves you, do love them back unconditionally - not only because they love you, but because they are teaching you to love and open your heart and eyes to little things. Make every day count. Appreciate every moment and treasure everything that you possibly can, for you may never be able to experience it again.  Talk to people you have never talked to before, and listen. Let yourself fall in love, break free and set your sights high. Hold your head up because you have every right to tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don't, no one else will.

      I got this from a friend today ...  If you find yourself in love with someone who does not love you, be gentle with yourself. There is nothing wrong with you. Love just didn't choose to rest in the other person's heart.  If you find someone else in love with you and you don't love him/her, feel honored that love came and called at your door, but gently refuse the gift you cannot return. Do not take advantage, do not cause pain.  How you deal with love is how you deal with you, and all our hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if our lives and ways are different.  If you fall in love with another, and he/she falls in love with you, and then love chooses to leave, do not try to reclaim it or to assess blame, let it go. There is a reason and there is a meaning. You will know in time.  Remember that you don't choose love. Love chooses you. All you can really do is accept it for all its mystery when it comes into your life. Feel the way it fills you to overflowing, then reach out and give it away.  Give it back to the person who brought it alive in you. Give it to others who deem it poor in spirit. Give it to the world  around you in anyway you can. There is where many lovers go wrong. Having been so long without love, they understand love only as a need. They see their hearts as empty places that will be filled by love, and they begin to look at love as something that flows to them rather than from them.  The first blush of new love is filled to overflowing, but as their love cools, they revert to seeing their love as need. They cease to be someone who generates love and instead become someone who seeks love.  They forget that the secret of love is that it is a gift, and that it can be made to grow only by giving it away. Remember this, and keep it to your heart. Love has its own time, its own seasons, and its own reason for coming and going. You cannot bribe it or coerce it, or reason it into staying. You can only embrace it when it arrives and give it away when it comes to you. But if it chooses to leave from your heart or from the heart of your lover, there is nothing you can do and there is nothing you should do.   Love always has been and always will be a mystery. Be glad that it came to live for a moment in your life.  Treasure your loved ones...Don't ever let love just slip away on its own..  Love won't wait for you..."If you want to be happy, be."

      Just my observation...not necessarily true and I claim exemption from any liability whatsoever...   Generally we can categorise our friends according to the circle you choose them to be in -  like inner circle, social circle, professional circle or just categorise them as:  Yaya Buddies (my favorite circle) - I love you all!  Best friends, good friends, friends, acquaintances  Colleagues and ex-colleagues  Business prospects  Clubbing friends (kowtow to Addie)  Drinking friends (kowtow to Shahrin, Jack will pass out after 2 drinks)  Promuda friends, toastmasters friends and other society friends  Golf friends or tennis buddies  Adventure friends and acitivity friends  Travel friends  pick-your-brain friends (for intellectual intercourse, errr, I mean, discourse)   Potential dates (Shahrin has a long list there)  Ex club (ahem, also kowtow to Shahrin, the president)  Sex buddies (errr... I swear someone told me this, and I'm not a member of this club)  Etc... and the list goes on. Some people I know segregate their friends into the respective circles they have created but most people don't. They just integrate all their friends into one big circle or two circles - "can click" and "cannot click".   My goodness, life was much simpler then when we were kids! It's like - "I friend you, okay" and if we fight it'll be "I don't wanna friend you anymore", and later "can we be friends again".     Okay....pour in your thots people.

       urlLink    Sale&nbsp; urlLink     I just had a fleeting thought about what women what - rather, what men think women want - the "C"s. What they work hard for in order to get women to want them. At the end of the day, they fail to question - do the women wat them or what they have?   Modern day dictum spells out the criteria as - Cash, Career, Condo, Car, Credit Card. Materialistic and superficial, really.   While all these are important in some ways, today people forget what's equally important, and perhaps even more so, more important than the others -  Class, Character, Consistency, Compatibility and Chemistry.   If a woman loves you for what you are, not for what you have, she'll stay with you through the thick and thin, good and bad times. A lot of men fail to realise that, I think.   Any opinions, gentlemen and ladies?

      I always try to achieve balance in getting both quality and quantity in many many things in life. I believe we can have many many good friends and more than one best friend. Well, I do. Your inner circle do have a capacity to expand and grow with time.    urlLink    My Yaya Buddies: Seated from left are Lili, Addie, Bad and Jack (hiding behind Bad). Standing from left are Noni, Amir, Naliza, Salehudin (Amir's friend) and Ina.&nbsp; urlLink     There are many kinds of friends, but we don't have to disqualify any of them just because they're not good to us at times, or no good to us for some things. Generally, there are good good times friends, bad good times friends, good bad times friends, bad bad times friends, and friends who are good for everything, and friends who are good for nothing, friends who trouble you and friends you trouble.   But only we know who are really our friends, especially the quality ones, and those friends are gems that outshine others in your life.   urlLink    My Yaya Buddies celebrating Noni's Birthday: Seated from left are Tayen, Noni and Shahrizal. Standing from left are Addie, Siti (my former dorm-mate), Mario, Naliza, Ina and Jack.&nbsp; urlLink     Friends are a very rare jewel, indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to succeed. They lend an ear, they share a word of praise, and they always want to open their heart to us.  So, here's an ode to my friends:  If I could catch a rainbow  I would do it just for you  and share with you its beauty  On the days you're feeling blue.   If I could build a mountain  You could call your very own  A place to find serenity  A place to be alone   If I could take your troubles  I would toss them! in the sea  But all these things I'm finding  are impossible for me.   I cannot build a mountain  Or catch a rainbow fair  But let me be what I know best-  A friend who's always there.

      Something interesting I discovered from what Nina sent me today:  Idiots in the office are just as hazardous as cigarretes, caffeine, or greasy food says a new eye-opening study. In fact these dopes can actually kill you!  Stress is one of the top causes of heart attacks - and working with dumb people on a daily basis is one of the deadliest forms of stress, according to researchers at Sweden's Lindbergh Medical Centre. The author of the study, Dr Dagmar Andersson, says her study team studied 500 heart atatcks and were puzzled to find 62% had relatively few of the physical risk factors commonly blamed for heart attacks.  "Then we questioned them about lifestyle habits, and almost all these low-risk patients told us how they worked with people so stupid that they can barely find their way from the parking lot to their office (sounds familiar?) And their heart attacks came less then 12 hours after having a major confrontation with one of these oafs."  "One woman had to be rushed to hospital after her assistant shredded important tax documents instead of copying them. A man told us he collapsed right at his desk becuase the woman at the next cubicle kept asking him for correction fluid - for her computer monitor."  "You can cut back on smoking or improve your diet, but most people have very poor coping skills when it comes to stupidity - they feel there's nothing they can do about it, so they just internalise their frustration until they finally explode!"  Stupid co-workers can also double or triple someone's workload she explains. "Many of our subjects feel sorry for the drooling idiots they work with, so they try to help them by fixing their mistakes. One poor woman spent a week rebuilding client records becuase a clerk put them all in the 'recylce bin' of her computer and then emptied it - she thought it meant the records would be recycled and used again."

      A friend told me a story of two friends who were walking through Sahara Desert. During some point of the journey they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face.   The one who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand:  TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE.  They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him. After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone:  TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SAVED MY LIFE.  The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him, "After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now, you write on a stone, why?" The other friend replied "When someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it."  LEARN TO WRITE YOUR HURTS IN THE SAND AND TO CARVE YOUR BENEFITS IN STONE.  They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then an entire life to forget them.  Do not value the THINGS you have in your life..  But value WHO you have in your life!

      Today...  Today before you think of saying an unkind word Think of someone who can’t speak Before you complain about the taste of your food Think of someone who has nothing to eat  Before you complain about your husband or wife Think of someone who's crying out to God for a companion Today before you complain about life Think of someone who went too early to heaven  Before you complain about your children Think of someone who desires children but they're barren Before you argue about your dirty house someone didn't clean or sweep Think of the people who are living in the streets  Before whining about the distance you drive Think of someone who walks the same distance with their feet And when you are tired and complain about your job Think of the unemployed, the disabled and those who wished they had your job  But before you think of pointing the finger or condemning another Remember that not one of us are without sin and we all answer to one maker And when depressing thoughts seem to get you down Put a smile on your face and thank God you're alive and still around  Life is a gift Live it... Enjoy it... Celebrate it... And fulfill it.

      Have you ever heard of the saying, "You get as much as you give"?  In the Al-Qur'an, Ash-Shura, Surah 42:30-31, Allah said: “If misfortune befalls you, it is the consequence of your own actions. Yet God forgives much. On this earth you can not escape God; and there is no one apart from God who can protect or help you.”  I made a mistake going out with The Married Man, while breaking up with The Aussie, and as a result I later ended up meeting The Jealous Ex-Boyfriend who is always suspicious of me - and I swear I have been a good girl all the while I was with The Jealous Ex-Boyfriend. But it is really very tiring trying to prove that I am worthy of his trust - so I have to let him go for good.   This must be my punishment for my little mis-adventure with The Married Man.

      They say, the only way on earth to multiply happiness is to divide it. To which I agree, but rather than divide, why not share the love.   Because, unless we practice loving feelings toward everyone we meet, day in, day out, we're missing out on the most joyous part of life.   If we can actually open our hearts, there's no difficulty in being happy. So, laugh all you want while you still can, because laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I'd say, frown not, unless it is for a very worthy reason.   They say, we either make ourselves happy or miserable. The amount of work is the same.

      I bumped into an old e-mail I wrote to The Consoler last year:  "I know you believe you understand what you think I said. But I am not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant. I was challenged by your deduction that I’m not ready to let The Unfaithful Hubby go. You mean to say, I don’t know what I’m doing?   There’s a great difference between good, sound reasons and reasons that sound good. I believe my reasons are good and sound and I will stand up for it.   I must thank you, however, for provoking my thoughts to explore every questions and discover the answers. What you did was awaken me from my deep slumber and open my eyes to examine and reexamine things I’ve overlooked.   As a friend who is a neutral third party, you’re capable of being objective and see my problem in a bird’s eye view. You provide me with the check and balance that helps me in weighing my options and sort out my thoughts.   Thanks to you, I have had a weekend full of reflections about what’s happening to me right now. I’m glad I took the trip to Malacca, being in a neutral place away from home helps me gain a new perspective of the problem at hand.   I was thinking deeply about the decision that I’ve made and the one I’m about to make which will close a big heavy door behind me.   I do believe when one door closes another door opens. But often we took so long and looked so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one that has opened for us. I realized this door has been opened for me many years ago and I had never dared to walk through that door until now.   That door opened for me when The Unfaithful Hubby and I wanted to get a divorce five years ago because he had an affair with his colleague. That’s when any romantic love I had for him wilted to a slow death. The romantic love becomes more and more platonic over the years. We stayed married because we needed and wanted each other and it’s convenient to do so.   If you ask me, The Unfaithful Hubby and I shouldn’t have gotten married in the first place because his conscience weren’t clear when he took the marriage vow. But I didn’t know then, and if I had known, I wouldn’t have accepted his proposal. If I had known, I would rather be single than be married and miserable.  In my deep thoughts and reflection, I have managed to sort out my feelings and clarify my decision. I feel it is very important to differentiate between need, want and love.  When that door opened five years ago, I didn’t walk through it because I had needed The Unfaithful Hubby emotionally and wanted him physically. Because of need and want, I wasn’t ready to let go although it hurts more to keep him.   When The Unfaithful Hubby left me for The Land Under The Wind and we went our separate ways, I have learned to stop needing and wanting him.   When he wrote me that e-mail, I realized that I’ve been ready to let him go all along. I just never knew before that I have the strength to do it, and make it on my own.   All I needed was just a reason, and this is a good and sound reason."  It hurt me so much to thinking about it more than a year ago. One year after, I find relief for having forgiven The Unfaithful Hubby and letting him go with no hard feelings. I think I have achieved some emotional freedom from the hurtful past when I closed that door. I am ready to open new doors now.

      Forrest Gump's mom said: "Life is like a box of chocolates. You don't know what you're gonna get." Similarly, I think love is like a box of chocolates, too. You don't know who - or rather, what - you're gonna get.

      The game of love, as I see it, is like taking a walk in a park. Some people have been to the park many many times and after a while forgot the wonders that the gardens in the park offer. They just want to rush to that white gazebo. For some, this is their first time walking in the park. They are taken in by the wonders, taking time to explore every garden in the park, breathe the air, smell the flowers, feel the grass under their feets. They see that white gazebo, but thought it can wait.   For some, this is their first time walking in the park. They are taken in by the wonders, taking time to explore every garden in the park, breathe the air, smell the flowers, feel the grass under their feets. But they see didn't see that white gazebo, they kept hopping on to different gardens. For other first timers, they walk in the park but just fail to see the wonders, or even know that the white gazebo exists and where.  Some people see the park from afar but other things in life becomes priority, so they never thought of stepping into the gardens thinking naaahhh, it's waste of time walking in the park. That white gazebo will still be there, if I want to get there at all. Some people learned about the park and are planning to get there but are still finding their way to park, getting lost somewhere. If only they care to ask for directions! Some people are so romantically and emotionally deficient...blurrr...hah, what park!?

       urlLink    Cubicle with a view&nbsp; urlLink     To blog or not to blog, is a stupid question that would put Shakespeare to shame. It seems to me that everybody blogs, and it's a healthy and legitimate avenue to express yourself.  As a teenager, I kept a diary to jot downs significant emotions and important events of each day. I kept doing that until about  10 years ago. Because I've forgotten the joy of keeping a diary, or remembering why it is so important - in the midst of being busy with life, trying keep a marriage alive, building a career, keeping up with the Joneses, building my circle of friends and trying keep everybody happy.  Some of the most memorable events and milestones have eluded my memory because I have forgotten to jot them down.   Today, some of the things that used to be so important to me, ceased to be so. My marriage died, I no longer want to keep up with the Joneses, I am happy with my circles of friends now - its the quality, not the quantity of friends you have that matters, and I stopped trying to make eveybody happy - you can't please everyone! Fortunately my career is progressing - it is probably my saving grace - the one thing that stops me from breaking down when my marriage fell apart.   In fact, I am suffering from "selective amnesia" - I don't remember the painful memories during five year marriage, and events leading to its death. I'm probably still in shock, or it's my protective shell working overtime to kill the trauma. Because I have no diary, I forgot many things that happened, and I seem to remember only the good memories. Which is not too bad. But some memories are lost for good.  I used to think, if I'm good, bad things won't happen to me. Terrible mistake - that's my punishment for believing in fairy tales. You can't expect the bull not to attack you just because you're a vegetarian! But nonetheless, I'll be good anyways.  Today, I created this blog and hope to continue jotting down my thots and memories - both good and bad - and wake up, and smell the coffee. I'm human afterall.  I would like to share this piece written by a friend, See Ming:  Journaling: Balm for Our Souls (By Chong See Ming)  Journaling has long been recommended as a beneficial tool in self awareness and understanding. Journaling has been said to nurture one's spirituality and build inroads into our unconscious minds.  Journal advocates say that journaling is the perfect way to take inventory of ourselves and our feelings, resolve conflicts, make decisions and bring clarity to our lives as well as to record our personal spiritual journey.  For me, it's always been a balm for my soul. As I record my thoughts, dreams, desires and feelings, my self-knowledge increases. Call it mental detoxification, mindful spring-cleaning, or any other terms, journaling for me is a form of meditation that de-clutters any mental confusion.Let's explore in detail some of the key advantages of keeping a journal:-  Journaling is an affordable method of self-therapy  A journal doesn't have to be an expensive hard-cover, bounded notebook with a built-in lock. I know some people who use thin school exercise books costing only 80 cents each, but as thoughts flow, the desired effect will still be the same. If you are technology-savvy, an online blog will cost next to nothing. Check out Blogger for free blogging tools. (And read Najah Nasseri's article on Blogging, this issue of ProDigy)  Journaling helps us solve problems  No matter how cliché is seems - the phrase "The answer lies within us" has been historically proven. Through journaling, we can start sifting through the whirlpools of our minds to find answers to issues that bother us.  Journaling helps us to excavate our authentic selves  In the noise of everyday world, we often prevented from listening to our inner voices. We are "polished" by what our family, friends and society demands of us whereby we gradually adopt mannerisms and values that may contradict who we were originally. The danger of losing ourselves this way is we may stop living the life we crave and live our lives for others. John Holt, an American educator described this problem exactly when he wrote in his book, Never Too Late: My Musical Life Story, " ...it is not easy to find out what we like or want, when all our lives, other people work trying not just to make us do what they want, but to make us think that we want to do it."  Journaling helps us listen to ourselves  Writing a journal may re-orientate us on the journey of self-discovery as it is a good way to let our inner voice comes through the hustle and bustle of our surroundings.  Putting our thoughts on paper could also help uncover the hidden mental obstacles which are stunting our growth, and help us become more aware of the negativity in our thoughts and resolve them.  Journaling is a healthy way to release pent-up emotions  In her book, Write Away, A Journal Writing Tool Kit, Eldonna Bouton asks "Think about how often you have been asked how you were and you automatically responded with "Fine." How many times were you really not fine, or worse, but couldn't really say how you were really feeling?"  A blank page is a safe place to dump anger and frustrations without hurting anyone. Releasing our feelings to the page may actually help them subside. We can use the journaling process to help us work through stressful events without the fear of social consequences, especially things that we don't want to discuss with friends or family.  Ultimately, this connection can reduce stress and keeps us healthy.  Journaling is an investment in ourselves  It does not require any skill or talent, just a willingness to write when we feel like it. We benefit from the self-expression and increased awareness of our thoughts and feelings.  In this way, journaling complements our life-long learning process as we document our experiences and learn as much as we can from them.  You might say I've kept a diary before but nothing came out of it. Well, unlike the diary of the past, where you dutifully recorded the events of the day, be clear that this new journal's purpose is to capture emotions and documenting feeling and sentiments. By capturing your thoughts on paper, you open communications links between your subconscious mind and your conscious mind, allowing your subconscious to emerge. And it might just help you solve the mystery of who you really are. Try it.  5 Quick Tips for Journal Keeping Commitment Keep your journal with you in your bag or somewhere conspicuous where you will always see it and be reminded. Block 10 minutes or more everyday as writing time.  The right tools Having the right tools can make the experience more enjoyable. Use your favourite pen and for longevity, write on acid-free, hand-made paper.  Date Date every entry as far as possible, make a note of the time, place and even weather. You will find these information useful in the future.  Find a support group Get your close friends to remind you to write in it. Get on to a jounal-writing mailing list - There's plenty on Yahoo Groups.  Be true to yourself Remember the best journal is one that is entirely YOU - so create your own rules, whatever that strikes your fancy.

      After a couple of days of "merajuk", Adik Kesayangan called me again this morning - and asked me not to leave him because he loves me so much.   While it is always good for any woman past 30 to have a young admirer worshiping the ground she walks on, I feel terribly conscientuous to take advantage of the situation. Conscience and scruples are terrible things sometimes - but they make me. They are what I am. No matter how badly I want to be a "bad girl", I can't because of my deep conscience and scruples. They always hover over my halo :)  Because, as the feeling is not mutual. Because, if he is really serious, I would break his young heart. I imagine it would be fragile - unhardened by experience, unlike mine. I have hit rock bottom emotionally, and I have survived many ordeals.  I have learned the hard way, and I was forced to grow up when my parents divorced when I was a teenager. I was forced to swallow the bitter pill when The Ex-Hubby left me two years ago. My whole universe has crumbled before his cold, cold heart when he crushed it under his feet. I have survived The Divorce, and although I am still reconstructing my world, I think I am doing okay.   Emotionally mutilated and scarred as I am, but at least, I learned a thing or two from my past experiences as I go along in life. The emotional scars are proof that I have lived. So, no regrets.  Now, back to Adik Kesayangan...  Yes, I do love him - but it is quite brotherly and platonic, that much I can say and I just cannot see past The Great Wall, well, at least for now.   Being young and foolish is not too bad. But to be an old fool is a major disaster - because that means we haven't picked up lessons from The School of Hard Knocks as we go along in life. We are supposed to be old and wise. Hypothetically, people past The Big 3-0 should have a respectable level of maturity and wisdom earned with years of experience in our hands. I do want to be respectable.  Anyways, back to Adik Kesayangan...  This morning, I just could not break his heart. I just told him I will never leave him - I always be with him - as his sister and a friend, if not as his lover. He sounded sad and soulful, and he told me that I hold the key and it is up to me to unlock the door. He said if I cannot accept him as a lover in this life, then his only wish is that in the next life he will be born in the same age group or older than me, so we can be together as lovers and I will not feel ridiculous being with him as I do now.   I think he sounded profound. For someone so young to be saying very wise things, he does have an old soul inside his young body. He is both so young and yet so old. How can someone so young have a very old soul.   But I wonder if he really knows what true love is, does he?   Even at this age, I myself don't really know what LOVE is. I have just discovered that after The Ex-Hubby left me - and I used to think that I do know what love is. But it turned out that, The Ex-Hubby represents My Ideals. I used to represent His Ideals. But then, His Ideals changed - and his feelings too. It caused My Ideals to change, too. What happened was, when The Marriage changed gears as we accelerated, we were still stuck to the same gear and it has damaged the gear box, beyond repair.  Anyways, back to love...  I believe there is a huge difference between being in love with someone and being in love with the IDEA of being in love with someone. There is a HUGE difference between being in LOVE and being in LUST with someone.

      I was in a prolific mood in My Kitchen yesterday. I concocted some mushroom seafood boulabaise that I learned how to make from watching Taste of Travel on the Discovery Travel channel on Astro - it turned out to be perfect. I also cooked some Country Fried Chicken - fattening but what the heck. It tasted real good, and oh my God,  I was praising my own cooking. But hey, what the heck, I was being honest with myself. Hehehe...I secretly believe I am blessed with The Gift from The Kitchen God, just like my mother.  While cooking up a storm in My Kitchen, I realised The Neighbor's Handsome Husband was watching me from their wet kitchen. He was cooking something. I smiled and waved at him and he did the same. Then, The Neighbor's Wife came out and said something, and The Neighbor's Handsome Husband was not seen again outside in their wet kitchen for the day. Hey, I was just being friendly - and I have no intention of making a pass at  The Neighbor's Handsome Husband. My oh my, I am not even half as georgous as Liv Tyler, my Femme Epitome, and people are worried for their husbands already. One of the occupational hazards of being The Divorcee - Janda.  Well, that aside, I was having a really good time by myself - and enjoying my La Cremeria ice cream dessert, watching The Box and then...  Just before lunch, Shida, my journalist friend from Business Times, called me and told me that my colleague, Hafiz, from our subsidiary whom she is doing a feature story on, was not cooperative enough in furnishing her the picture she requires. Hafiz had asked Shida to come to their office in Kelana Jaya on Sunday to collect the picture she needed. How unthoughtful, and lacking PR skills - why not bring it over to Business Times. What can I say, Idiots at Work can really ruin your weekend.  Anyways, now in order to get the picture, I have to call my colleague, Sufian, The Designer. So, I called him in desperation of wanting the picture really badly. The Jealous Wife picked up, and I really hate to speak to The Jealous Wife. She is never nice to me - no matter how nice I speak to her. I wonder why some people do that. But I don't care, I got Sufian to provide me the pictures, and got him to leave it on my desk at the office. I will pick it up on the way to meet Shida. And then, I called Shida and arranged to meet up for Teh Tarik.  Just before 2pm, Zahar, whom I call The Panda Bear now, called and I talked to him for a while. As he was hungry, I offered to bring him his Tiffin Lunch from what I cooked earlier, to his site office, which is on the way to My Office. Gee, after doing that, I feel like his Big Sister. After talking to him for a while, I sped off to My Office and then had Teh Tarik with Shida at Mutiara Bangsar's Happening Mamak. She always has Spicy Stories to tell. And she also laughed for a full 15 minutes when I told her about Adik Kesayangan. That is so not cool!   Anyways, after my Teh Tarik with Shida and her colleague, Ooi, I went to The Croppes in Bangsar, to do my hair.  Felix is one of the few hairdressers I know who handles natural curls wonderfully. That's why I always go to him.  With my new coiffeur, I feel like going to some place happening. So I sat at The Strudels just across the street and sipped on my Vanilla Latter and Mango Tart. Then, The Jealous Ex-Boyfriend called and wanted me to wait for him until he comes. While waiting, Leslean, Bernama's Klang Bureau Chief appeared and together with her friend, Izzaty, a journalist with The Star joined me for drinks. Girls Talk.   I suppose, yesterday, I met four journalists in a day! The Boss would be proud that I am taking my media relations initiative out of the office boundary. But anyways, I was not only meeting journalists, they are my friends, too.  When Sopian appeared, I excused myself and joined him at Mahbub's. We had a long discussion about our situation. He can't trust me, and want to take time to do that. But he also wanted a cooling off period until January, and if we are still available then, we should reconsider marriage. I said nothing. It doesn't make sense to me. Why is it so difficult to trust me. His ex-wife may be unfaithful, but why shouldn't he forget the past, move on, and realise that I am not like that. So, I told him, we are friends. I don't want a cooling off period. Three break-ups are more than I can handle.  Sometimes, it is nicer to have someone who is hopeless in love with you, rather than being hopelessly in love with someone, and it is not what you hoped for it to be.

       urlLink    Marriage counsellor&nbsp; urlLink     Benjamin Franklin said, a man wrapped up in himself makes a very small bundle.   My recent two encounters have proven this saying to be true - The Army Officer and The Jealous Ex-Boyfriend - and I would like to add, no matter at what age he is. As my good ole friend Suku Gopal said, men never mature anyways - so age does not matter.   Last night, I had to tell The Army Officer, who has been pursuing me in the last one month, that I cannot accept him as more than "Adik Kesayangan" or a precious little brother. He has a lot of growing up to do before he is ready for a relationship, even with a girl his age. He is just overzealous and idealistic on the idea of love. In fact, I think it is the idea of love that he is in love with, and not with me. In my younger days, I have been there many times.  Youth, impatience and restless enthusiasm usually leads to foolishness and many regrets. I have learned that too in my younger days.  Today, he refused to talk to me, saying that I do not think that he is worthy enough for me and that I am materialistic in thinking so - that I refused him because he has nothing to offer me at this juncture.    That is simply not true - I am NOT a Material Girl.   Correction, I am Grey Matter Girl - although Lotsa Money is sexy, and Good Looks is a Bonus, I think The Brain is sexier. Now, add Benefits - a spoonful of Personality, Charms, Articulation - and The Heart & Soul - I might just be swept off my feet and fall in love hopelessly with Mr. Grey Matter with Benefits and The Heart & Soul. Well, if he exists, and interested in me too, that is. Otherwise, Mr. Grey Matter with The Heart & Soul will do just fine.   Back to Adik Kesayangan, it seems to me that he looks at it this way - because we cannot be lovers, love certainly cannot reside in our hearts anymore. This naive young man cannot believe that Platonic love exists between a man and a woman.   Romantic love can become platonic love and vice versa - that was my idea and platonic love is what I feel for him. But, now it's either we become lovers or he cannot have any other feelings for me. I suppose love evaporates so very quickly in foolish young hearts.   But then, that is not entirely true - love evaporates so very quickly in foolish old hearts too, The Jealous Ex-Boyfriend is 40 years old, but behaves just a tad bit more maturely than Adik Kesayangan, who is only 22 years old. But it must be an isolated case, because The Aussie, The Married Man and I share Platonic Love after finding out Romantic Love is not viable.  Let us just deliberate on this thought - can real Platonic love cannot exist between a man and a woman?   I think it does to a certain degree - and can exist at different platonic levels.  Otherwise, how do I explain the fact that I still do love The Ex-Hubby, The Rebound Crush, The Aussie, The Married Man and The Jealous Ex-Boyfriend - and in different ways for each of them, and at different platonic levels.   Love, I believe, although it can be mutilated, it cannot be murdered. Because love, like anger, is a fluid energy flowing through our individual universe. Once it exists in our universe, this energy cannot be destroyed, it just mutilates into other forms. It takes a lot of maturity and awareness to understand how this fluid energy works.   As a man wrapped up in himself makes a very small bundle, I will wait patiently for Adik Kesayangan, The Jealous Ex-Boyfriend, and The Ex-Hubby to grow up and open up their bundles and understand this principles. Just like The Aussie and The Married Man do.    If everybody understands how this fluid energy works, the world will have more peace and harmony - and we will have less conflicts to deal with.

      One day, Plato asked his teacher, "What is love? How can I find it?"  The teacher answered, "There's a large wheat field in front. Walk there without turning back, and take just one leaf. If you can find one leaf that you think is extraordinary, it means you have found love."  So Plato walked...and not long after that, he came back empty-handed.  The teacher asked him, "Why, you don't bring any leaf?"  Plato said, "I can only bring just one leaf and when I walked through the wheat field I can't turn my back. Actually I have found one extraordinary leaf, but I don't know whether there's any other leaf more extraordinary, so I didn't take that leaf. When I walked further, I realized that the leaves I found are not as extraordinary compared to the leaf I've found earlier in my walk. In the end, I didn't take any single leaf."  Then the teacher told him, "So...that is love."  Another day, Plato asked his teacher again, "What is marriage? How can I find it?"  The teacher answered, "There is a forest in front. Please walk there and don't look back. You can only cut one tree, and cut the one that you think is the highest. That is when you find marriage."   Plato walks there, and he came back not long after bringing one tree. The tree, however, is not a very good tree and not a very tall one, either. It's just an ordinary tree.  The teacher asked him, "Why did you cut that kind of tree?"  Plato answered, "Because from my previous experience, after walking through the wheat field, I came back with nothing. So this time, when I saw this tree which I think is not so bad, I decided to cut it and bring it here. I don't want to lose another chance to get it." And the teacher said, "Well .. that is marriage."  Some thoughts:  The more you look for love, you will find nothing. Love is in your heart, when you can control your desire and your hope to find something better. When you have endless hope and wish of love, you will only get emptiness...because you won't get anything and time can not be turned back. Accept love for what it is.  Marriage is a continuation of love. It's a process of having chances, and you choose the best option among all the alternatives. If you want to have a perfect match and a perfect marriage, you will only waste your time, because there is no perfect marriage.

      "One of the things I learned the hard way was that it doesn't pay to get discouraged. Keeping busy and making optimism a way of life can restore your faith in yourself," Lucille Ball (1911-1989), the Comic Actress once said.  Similarly, for me, to take my minds off The Ex-Hubby and the things that he did to hurt me, I have been keeping busy for the last two years. It worked for a year, but now I find myself too busy for me to handle things. I not only outdid and overdid myself, but I have also overstretched myself.   If only this is likened to my height, I would have grown-by-stretching by 3 inches. Intellectually, spiritually, emotionally and socially my horizons have expanded beyond my expectations in the past two years.   Looking back, I now thank The Ex-Hubby for upsetting my apple cart and for making me realise there is more to it to life than him. I used to live my life for him.  Now that the storms have pacified and the sea is calm, I am able to reflect and climbed up another rung in my self awareness ladder.  I realise this - while "keeping busy" has met its objective in easing the hurt, it hasn't unearthed the roots of the hurt - and it's rotting. It hasn't stopped the bleeding. It just put a band-aid over the old still-bleeding wound.   My point is, "keeping busy" has kept me in denial - things look alright because being a SURVIVOR of an ordeal makes most people look like a picture of resilience and strength, and nothings get her down. If only they know, I am not THAT strong, not THAT invincible, and not THAT hero some people wanted me to be. I am just human, and I am vulnerable.   In keeping busy, I have denied myself a natural healing process, by confronting the hurt and dealing with it by taking the bull by the horn. I took the easy way out - by riding the bull instead, with a vengeance too. Now, I am feeling the pain and hurt all over again.   But I do know this - I must get out of this SURVIVOR mode and get into THRIVER mode.   urlLink    The Hidden Tiger&nbsp; urlLink

      I learned a new thing from Tarrot & Tea at Navin's Place on Thursday night, last week - to realise that I am perfect exactly as I am. That I do not not need to take refuge behind my "teddy bear" - such as the need to have a string of achievements to be considered worthy of being myself. I have gotten it wrong for many years because right now, where I am, I as I am is not enough. I must learn to accept myself unconditionally - that I am perfect exactly as I am.   To quote Louise L. Hay in "Inner Wisdom": I am neither two much nor too little. I do not have to prove to anyone or anything who I am. I have been many identities, each one a perfect expression for that particular lifetime. I am content to be who and what I am this time. I do not yearn to be like someone else, for that is not the experience I chose this time. Next time I will be different. I am perfect as I am, right now. I am sufficient. I am one with all of life. There is no need to struggle to be better. All I need to do is love myself more today than yesterday, and to treat myself as someone who is deeply loved. With joy, I recognize my perfection and the perfection of life.

      I am feeling depressed today. The Boss is getting even more brutal since The Big Boss came on board just a few days ago. She has to cascade down the pressure she is getting from The Top and I don't blame her either. I understand her dilemma.   The Boyfriend and I broke up for the third time last two weeks. The Aussie didn't want to convert to become a Muslim, and wanted a civil marriage. The Ex-Hubby left me two years ago, and The Young Admirer, whom I thought was 26, is only 22, and just out of college. Not only that, he has just joined The Army. Hence, I shall call him The Army Officer.  When I think about it, The Army Officer makes me feel like a cradle snatcher. Of course, I do enjoy all the attention, flummery and sweet nothings, and his naiveness to think I was only 30. Well, I wish!   Nevertheless, as entertaining as he is as an entertainment, I should not be entertaining the silliness of this. I am hitting mid-30s next year, who am I kidding? God must be playing a wicked trick on me!   I have thought about going away someplace far away by myself to really think - but really I don't know what to think about.   Go there and what, think and cry?   I should go to Club Med, there's plenty of things to do since I cannot think of what to think. Anyways...   You must be thinking what am I doing at this hour still at work. I'm thinking!   Was just reading something on mind mapping. Interesting stuff. Let see if I use this to solve my problem creatively.   Okay...the truth is...I hate going home early because I cannot stand it coming home to The Empty Home being alone and having no one to talk to and snuggle up to. I don't miss The Sex as much as I miss The Snuggle. It just makes your day whole.    urlLink    The Snuggle&nbsp; urlLink     Back to The Empty Home, I'll end up flipping the channels on The Box. There's nothing to watch on Astro anyways. Always end up with Discovery Travel channel. Now I wonder why we're paying the extra few Ringgit after the fee hike.   Well, next time I'll just read.   Sigh! I do miss The Ex-Hubby, no matter how I hate him sometimes - The First Love is The Best, The First Kiss is The Sweetest. Then again, the First Cut is The Deepest.

      Born on 6th November, I am a Scorpio, and being born in 1970, the Year of the Dog, I'm a "Dog".    Here's what most Scorpions are like:  Strong-willed, Secretive, Possessive, Investigator, Passionate Scorpio is the Fixed-Water sign. Scorpios stubbornly cling to emotional attachments. They rarely forget or forgive emotional rejection. They have to learn that jealousy and possessiveness are self-defeating. Rechanneling negative feelings and experiences into constructive activities benefits others as well as themselves. No other sign has the emotional strength of Scorpio. Scorpios react emotionally to everything they experience in life.   Scorpios have a strong, competitive nature. With little effort they become exceptional athletes. They want real challenges and will not easily suffer would-be competitors who do not possess skills that are equal to their own. They enjoy sports that require strength, swiftness, and cunning. Body-building, soccer, hockey, hunting, swimming, scuba diving, and spelunking are favorite activities.   Scorpio colors are red, black, midnight blue, and emerald green. Vulnerable parts of the body are the reproductive organs and excretory system. Headaches, infections, and fevers are Scorpio complaints. Topaz is Scorpio's birthstone. Scorpio flowers include the anemone, heather, and gardenia.  http://www.dailyscopes.com/scorpio-sun.html  Here's what most "Dogs" are like:  The dog person is loyal, sincere, honest, and faithful. Dogs tend to be serious people who complain and worry, but they mellow with age. Dogs are honorable and speak out against injustice.   When rubbed the wrong way, dog people can be defensive and picky, but generally are agreeable companions. Dogs can keep a secret, respect traditions, and enjoy helping others. Although never the life of a party, dogs are intelligent, caring, and good listeners. In relationships, the dog person is the giver and the partner is the taker.

       urlLink    Hey Mickey!&nbsp; urlLink     I heard the cloned baby may have some genetic defects and will have medical problems later on too. Evolve into a mutated clone? Maybe she'll be like storm in the X-Men.    Ethical and morality aside, what about couples who are totally infertile and cloning is their only hope for reproduction? Thirty years ago, test tube babies were only a speculation. Five years down the road, a scientific breakthrough.and ten years later, it's common. Even The Boss has one and I don't mind getting one. Human cloning will probably evolve in the same manner.    Hurray, there'll be another alternative for single women who aspires to have a baby, but on the downside, sperm banks will have a deficit in customers and donors. While waiting for 2005, men may consider donating to the sperm bank to avoid future deficits and and to secure futures market at current prices.    If The Don is worried that the Raelian Movement has more members than Promuda, offer this package to Promuda and this will also secure future more Promuda memberships. Hey, new members ready to be hatched from a test tube. Later on when human cloning is commonplace, we can clone more Promuda members too. There you go, let's have three of each of us. Five of my best friend Zarina would be beneficial, she's prolific in everything she does.    Future scenario - it's like "I have headache tonight dear, can you have sex with my clone. I'll wake her up, I think she's in the freezer". Hahaha...

      Received this very interesting piece from a friend today...   ======  Here is a piece written by Andy Rooney   Andy Rooney says, "As I grow in age, I value women who are over 30 most of all. Here are just a few reasons why:   A woman over 30 will never wake you in the middle of the night to ask, "What are you thinking?" She doesn't care what you think.   If a woman over 30 doesn't want to watch the game, she doesn't sit around whining about it. She does something she wants to do. And it's usually something more interesting.   A woman over 30 knows herself well enough to be assured in who she is,what she is, what she wants and from whom. Few women past the age of 30 give a damn what you might think about her or what she's doing.   Women over 30 are dignified. They seldom have a screaming match with you at the opera or in the middle of an expensive restaurant. Of course, if you deserve it, they won't h esitate to shoot you, if they think they can get away with it.   Older women are generous with praise, often undeserved. They know what it's like to be unappreciated.   A woman over 30 has the self-assurance to introduce you to her women friends. A younger woman with a man will often ignore even her best friend because she doesn't trust the guy with other women. Women over 30 couldn't care less if you're attracted to her friends because she knows her friends won't betray her.   Women get psychic as they age. You never have to confess your sins to a woman over 30. They always know. A woman over 30 looks good wearing bright red lipstick. This is not true of younger women or drag queens.   Once you get past a wrinkle or two, a woman over 30 is far sexier than her younger counterpart. Older women are forthright and honest. They'll tell you right off you are a jerk if you are acting like one. You don't ever have to wonder where you stand with her.   Yes , we praise women over 30 for a multitude of reasons. Unfortunately, it's not reciprocal. For every stunning, smart, well-coiffed hot woman of 30+, there is a bald, paunchy relic in yellow pants making a fool of himself with some 22-year-old waitress.   Ladies, I apologize.

      Sudden Flash Back. I think I'm getting my memory back...  The Ex-Hubby is aerophobic. Besides being hydrophobic and agrophobic.   There was one time we were flying from San Jose to Los Angeles. Must be in September 1993, before we got married. While flying over the waters of Santa Ana, we hit an air pocket, it dropped almost thousand metres I think. The Ex-Hubby was terribly pale with fear. I was scared too but I thot, there's nothing I can do anyways if we crashed. I prayed and then continued reading my book.   Then he said, what if we land in the waters? I said, if we didn't die, just take a swim to shore or to the nearest boat if any. Then he went even paler. he said he doesn't swim. So, I said, too late to learn now. But anyways, swimmers or not, the sharks will surely have a feast. I thot that should be a consolation, but guess i scared the shit out of him. He almost passed out from out of breath.  No wonder he left me, I was mean to him in that way.

      I finished reading Paulo Coelho's "The Alchemist" and I conclude - many of us search the world over to find what we though we want in life, only to come home and find what we really want right before our eyes.   Just like Santiago in "The Alchemist" who travelled across the earth and the searing sahara in search of his treasure, and only to find out his treasure is buried at home.   Coelho says we must listen to our heart to find our destiny. But if i listen to my heart right now, I can hear it breaking into pieces.   I saw what i think is the treasure I'm seeking - my heart is relenting but my mind is defiant, telling me it may not be my destiny to claim that treasure. Hence, I searched for other treasures that may be my real destiny - but why does my heart comes back to the first treasure that I saw.   Everyone know their destiny when they were born and while they were young. But as we walk through life, many many mysterious forces of the universe led us to stray far from our real destiny that most of us forget what is our destiny.   We get distracted by life and by what we think is important because the rest of the world think so. We are afraid to reveal our true self in case the rest of the world don't approve of what we really are because we may not fit into the larger scheme of things - what the world think we should be, act and think. And we conspire with the world to forget our real destiny.  If we listen to our heart and figure out our real destiny, the whole universe conspires to help us achieve our destiny.

      At MCOBA Building, we have lots of "friends" here after hours.  I've encountered a few times. In one incident, my boss and I were working late and there's no one left on our our floor. While we were discussing in her room, someone just walked past towards the exit door. When you exit the door you will have to swipe and the security access system will make a "toot" noise. No noise. We looked around our office, no one was there. We thot, it may be an optical illusion, but strange that both of saw the same thing at the same time. But due to deadline, we decided to just ignore it and continued our discussion.   Just another half hour, this "person" walked by again and we caught a good glimpse of him. Believe it or not, he's dressed as a Santa Claus! After that we decided to call it a day.  The next morning we related the incident to our colleagues and our communications assistant told us that we have a life size mannequin dressed up as Santa Claus in the store room which they used as Christmas decoration! Imagine the spookiness we felt! Right away my boss asked him to remove the mannequin for good. Come to think of it, being stored away in the store room, perhaps he felt lonely and wanting attention?  Guess what...behind our office is a large plot of cemetery, too.

      In a brief conversation, a man asked a woman he was pursuing the question " What kind of man are you looking for?"  She sat quietly for a moment before looking him in the eye and asking, "Do you really want to know?"  Reluctantly, he said "Yes."  She began to expound...  "As a woman in this day and age, I am in a position to ask a man what he can do for me that I can't do for myself. I pay my own bills. I take care of my household without the help of any man...or woman for that matter. I am in the position to ask, "What can you bring to the table?"  The man looked at her. Clearly he thought that she was referring to money.  She quickly corrected his thought and stated, "I am not referring to money. I need something more. I need a man who is striving for perfection in every aspect of life. "  He sat back in his chair, folded his arms, and asked her to explain.  She said "I am looking for someone who is striving for perfection mentally because I need conversation and mental stimulation. I don't need a simple-minded man. I am looking for someone who is striving for perfection spiritually because I don't need to be unequally yoked... believers mixed with unbelievers is a recipe for disaster. I need a man who is striving for perfection financially because I don't need a financial burden. I am looking for someone who is sensitive enough to understand what I go through as a woman, but strong enough to keep me grounded. I am looking for someone who I can respect. In order to be submissive, I must respect him. I cannot be submissive to a man who isn't taking care of his business. I have no problem being submissive...he just has to be worthy. God made woman to be a help mate for man. I can't help a man if he can't help himself."  When she finished her spiel, she looked at him. He sat there with a puzzled look on his face. He said, "You are asking a lot."   She replied, "I'm worth a lot."

      They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.  You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.  You look at your job...and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you.  Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't.  One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling onto the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.  You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lay in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person.  Random hook ups start to look cheap. Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic.  You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision.  You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself.....and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender!  What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it.  We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.

      They say, brain cells come and brain cells go - but fat cells live forever!   Right now I feel like Ms Couch Potato.   urlLink    Ms Couch Potato&nbsp; urlLink     When I was in my 20s, I refused to believe that losing weight after hitting The Big 3-0 is an uphill battle. Today, I'm afraid that it is true. I have been trying to lose 5kg and keep it off, for the last one year - unsuccessfully, and my weight fluctuation has been like a yoyo.  It probably beats the Malaysian stock market movements - if the Composit Index is my weight, it must be breaking way past the 1, 000 points.   It doesn't help that The Boss thinks I'm overweight and have hit the highest of all time. As a PR manager for Malaysia's leading infrastructure builder, I have to project a positive image, she said. Being fat isn't. Worse, The Boyfriend thinks so too. So he's not my boyfriend anymore. I think he should accept me as I am.  Doesn't personality and a mind mean something?  From 17th century onwards, being overweight has always been associated with negativity. The Mona Lisa wasn't exactly thin, and she was thought to be the ideal female in those days! Obviously, I live in the wrong century.  Today, there is much obsession about being thin, getting into that tight dress that can only my thighs can fit into it. Society thinks being overweight is not normal. We are unfairly discriminated against. We have The Smokers and The Non-Smokers, and we have The Fat and The Rest.

      Singapore girl wins Commonwealth essay prize!  A 15-YEAR-OLD Singaporean, competing against 16- to 18-year-olds, has won the top prize in a writing contest that drew 5,300 entries from 52 countries.  In the annual Commonwealth Essay Competition, Amanda Chong of Raffles Girls'School (Secondary) chose to compete in the older category and won with a piece on the restlessness of modern life.  Her short story, titled What The Modern Woman Wants, focused on the conflict in values between an old lady and her independent-minded daughter.  'Through my story, I attempted to convey the unique East-versus-West struggles and generation gaps that I felt were characteristic of young people in my country,' said Amanda, who likes drama, history and literature and wants to become a lawyer and a politician.  Chief examiner Charles Kemp called her piece a 'powerfully moving and ironical critique of modern restlessness and its potentially cruel consequences'. The writing is fluent and assured, with excellent use of dialogue.  Amanda gets (S$1,590). A Singaporean last won the top prize in 2000, said Britain's Royal Commonwealth Society, which has been organising the competition since 1883. Singaporeans also came in second in the 14- to 15-year-old category, and fourth in the under-12s. Other winners included students from Australia, Canada and South Africa.  ==================================================================  What the Modern Woman Wants By Amanda Chong Wei-Zhen  The old woman sat in the backseat of the magenta convertible as it careened down the highway, clutching tightly to the plastic bag on her lap, afraid it  may be kidnapped by the wind. She was not used to such speed, with trembling hands she pulled the seatbelt tighter but was careful not to touch the patent leather seats with her callused fingers, her daughter had warned her not to dirty it, 'Fingerprints show very clearly on white, Ma.'  Her daughter, Bee Choo, was driving and talking on her sleek silver mobile phone using big words the old woman could barely understand.  'Finance' 'Liquidation' 'Assets' 'Investments'... Her voice was crisp and important and had an unfamiliar lilt to it. Her Bee Choo sounded like one of those foreign girls on television. She was speaking in an American accent.  The old lady clucked her tongue in disapproval.  'I absolutely cannot have this. We have to sell!' Her daughter exclaimed agitatedly as she stepped on the accelerator; her perfectly manicured fingernails gripping onto the steering wheel in irritation.  'I can't DEAL with this anymore!' she yelled as she clicked the phone shut and hurled it angrily toward the backseat.  The mobile phone hit the old woman on the forehead and nestled soundlessly into her lap. She calmly picked it up and handed it to her daughter.  'Sorry, Ma,' she said, losing the American pretence and switching to Mandarin. 'I have a big client in America. There have been a lot of problems.'  The old lady nodded knowingly. Her daughter was big and important.  Bee Choo stared at her mother from the rear view window, wondering what she was thinking. Her mother's wrinkled countenance always carried the same cryptic look.  The phone began to ring again, an artificially cheerful digital tune, which broke the awkward silence.  'Hello, Beatrice! Yes, this is Elaine.' Elaine. The old woman cringed. I didn't name her Elaine. She remembered her daughter telling her, how an English name was very important for 'networking', Chinese ones being easily forgotten.  'Oh no, I can't see you for lunch today. I have to take the ancient relic to the temple for her weird daily prayer ritual.'  Ancient Relic. The old woman understood perfectly it was referring to her. Her daughter always assumed that her mother's silence meant she did not comprehend.  'Yes, I know! My car seats will be reeking of joss sticks!'  The old woman pursed her lips tightly, her hands gripping her plastic bag in defence.  The car curved smoothly into the temple courtyard. It looked almost garish next to the dull sheen of the ageing temple's roof. The old woman got out of the back seat, and made her unhurried way to the main hall.  Her daughter stepped out of the car in her business suit and stilettos and reapplied her lipstick as she made her brisk way to her mother's side.  'Ma, I'll wait outside. I have an important phone call to make,' she said, not bothering to hide her disgust at the pungent fumes of incense.  The old lady hobbled into the temple hall and lit a joss stick, she knelt down solemnly and whispered her now familiar daily prayer to the Gods.  Thank you God of the Sky, you have given my daughter luck all these years. Everything I prayed for, you have given her. She has everything a young woman in this world could possibly want. She has a big house with a swimming pool, a maid to help her, as she is too clumsy to sew or cook.   Her love life has been blessed; she is engaged to a rich and handsome angmoh man. Her company is now the top financial firm and even men listen to what she says. She lives the perfect life. You have given her everything except happiness. I ask that the gods be merciful to her even if she has lost her roots while reaping the harvest of success.  What you see is not true, she is a filial daughter to me. She gives me a room in her big house and provides well for me. She is rude to me only because I affect her happiness. A young woman does not want to be hindered by her old mother. It is my fault.  The old lady prayed so hard that tears welled up in her eyes. Finally, with her head bowed in reverence she planted the half-burnt joss stick into an urn of smouldering ashes.  She bowed once more.  The old woman had been praying for her d aughter for thirty-two years. When her stomach was round like a melon, she came to the temple and prayed that it was a son.   Then the time was ripe and the baby slipped out of her womb, bawling and adorable with fat thighs and pink cheeks, but unmistakably, a girl. Her husband had kicked and punched her for producing a useless baby who could not work or carry the family name.  Still, the woman returned to the temple with her new-born girl tied to her waist in a sarong and prayed that her daughter would grow up and have everything she ever wanted. Her husband left her and she prayed that her daughter would never have to depend on a man.  She prayed every day that her daughter would be a great woman, the woman that she, meek and uneducated, could never become. A woman with nengkan; the ability to do anything she set her mind to. A woman who commanded respect in the hearts of men. When she opened her mouth to speak, precious pearls would fall out and men would listen.  She will not be like me, the woman prayed as she watched her daughter grow up and drift away from her, speaking a language she scarcely understood. She watched her daughter transform from a quiet girl, to one who openly defied her, calling her laotu; old-fashioned. She wanted her mother to be 'modern', a word so new there was no Chinese word for it.   Now her daughter was too clever for her and the old woman wondered why she had prayed like that. The gods had been faithful to her persistent prayer, but the weal th and success that poured forth so richly had buried the girl's roots and now she stood, faceless, with no identity, bound to the soil of her ancestors by only a string of origami banknotes.   Her daughter had forgotten her mother's values. Her wants were so ephemeral; that of a modern woman. Power, Wealth, access to the best fashion boutiques, and yet her daughter had not found true happiness. The old woman knew that you could find happiness with much less. When her daughter left the earth everything she had would count for nothing. People would look to her legacy and say that she was a great woman, but she would be forgotten once the wind blows over, like the ashes of  burnt paper convertibles and mansions.  The old woman wished she could go back and erase all her big hopes and prayers for her daughter; now she had only one want: That her d aughter be happy. She looked out of the temple gate. She saw her daughter speaking on the phone, her brow furrowed with anger and worry. Being at the top is not good, the woman thought, there is only one way to go from there - down.   The old woman carefully unfolded the plastic bag and spread out a packet of beehoon in front of the altar.  Her daughter often mocked her for worshipping porcelain Gods. How could she pray to them so faithfully and expect pieces of ceramic to fly to her aid? But her daughter had her own gods too, idols of wealth, success and power that she was enslaved to and worshipped every day of her life.  Every day was a quest for the idols, and the idols she worshipped counted for nothing in eternity. All the wants her daughter had would slowly suck the life out of her and leave her, an empty soulless shell at the altar.  The old lady watched her joss tick. The dull heat had left a teetering grey stem that was on the danger of collapsing.  Modern woman nowadays, the old lady sighed in resignation, as she bowed to the east one final time to end her ritual. Modern woman nowadays want so much that they lose their souls and wonder why they cannot find it.  Her joss stick disintegrated into a soft grey powder.   She met her daughter outside the temple, the same look of worry and frustration was etched on her daughter's face. An empty expression, as if she was ploughing through the soil of her wants looking for the one thing that would sow the seeds of happiness.  They climbed into the convertible in silence and her daughter drove along the highway, this time not as fast as she had done before.  'Ma,' Bee Choo finally said. 'I don't know how to put this. Mark and I have been talking about it and we plan to move out of the big house. The property market is good now, and we managed to get a buyer willing to pay seven million for it. We decided we'd prefer a cosier penthouse apartment instead. We found a perfect one in Orchard Road. Once we move in to our apartment we plan to get rid of the maid, so we can have more space to ourselves...'  The old woman nodded knowingly.  Bee Choo swallowed hard. 'We'd get someone to come in to do the housework and we can eat out-but once the maid is gone, there won't be anyone to look after you. You will be awfully lonely at home and, besides that, the apartment is rather small. There won't be space. We thought about it for a long time, and we decided the best thing for you is if you moved to a Home. There's one near Hougang-it's a Christian home, a very nice one.'  The old woman did not raise an eyebrow. 'I've been there, the matron is willing to take you in. It's beautiful with gardens and lots of old people to keep you company! I hardly have time for you, you'd be happier there.'   'You'd be happier there, really.' Her daughter repeated as if to affirm herself.  This time the old woman had no plastic bag of food offerings to cling tightly to; she bit her lip and fastened her seat belt, as if it would protect her from a  daughter who did not want her anymore. She sunk deep into the leather seat, letting her shoulders s ag, and her fingers trace the white seat.  'Ma?' her daughter asked, searching the rear view window for her mother. 'Is everything okay?'  What had to be done, had to be done. 'Yes,' she said firmly, louder than she intended, 'if it will make you happy,' she added more quietly.  'It's for you, Ma! You'll be happier there. You can move there tomorrow, I already got the maid to pack your things.' Elaine said triumphantly, mentally ticking yet another item off her agenda.  'I knew everything would be fine.'  Elaine smiled widely; she felt liberated. Perhaps getting rid of her mother would make her happier. She had thought about it. It seemed the only hindrance in her pursuit of happiness. She was happy now. She had everything a modern woman ever wanted; Money, Status, Career, Love,Power and now, Freedom, without her mother and her old-fashioned ways to weigh her down...  Yes, she was free. Her phone buzzed urgently, she picked it up and read the message, still beaming from ear to ear. 'Stocks 10% increase!'  Yes, things were definitely beginning to look up for her...  And while searching for the meaning of life in the luminance of her hand phone screen, the old woman in the backseat became invisible, and she did not see the tears.

      Life can be an uphill task, just keeping up, and I'm not talking just about the running, but also about my life in general.  I have so many junks in my backyard so to speak. It's time to do some spring cleaning - and be more organised, and create some sense of stability in my life.   Life goes on, so I must sort out my life. This is a good battle that I feel is worth the while - battle of the bulging tummy, battle against indebtedness to credit cards, battle against feeling of powerlessness, battle against being a victim, battle against bad habits, battle against procrastination, battle against ignorance, battle against self worthlessness, battle against depression.   If life goes on, then it must be good, so that it will be worth living it. So I must have a strong and clear purpose in life for it to be really meaningful.   For two years, I have been emotionally numb, it's a soothing mechanism triggered by the need to protect my heart against the emotional hurt and pain - so that whatever comes, I will not feel it. But it's not a good thing over the long haul - it made me numb emotionally. And I want to FEEL again. I want to LIVE again!  I must conquer life and emerge a winner, redeem myself, like a phoenix rising out of its own ashes.  I must, because the foolish man seeks happiness in the distance; the wise grows it under his feet (James Oppenheim).

      The poet, Robert Frost said, "In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on."  I trained for The Rat Race and The Big Walk today, and managed to qualify only for The Tortoise Award. My team left me by a good half mile - I just can't keep up.  Everyday has been an uphill climb for me for the past one year. There are times I feel like ending it all and just cease to exist. But is it worth it, and for what? There's absolutely no reason why I should - I do have a good life, I have a career and a good paying job, I have family and friends who love me - some would even go out of their way to come to my aid. Life sounds perfect, right? So there is absolutely no valid reason whatsoever.   But I'm so lonely, so, so lonely and yet life must go on. The curtains are still up -so the show must go on. I wanted so much to blame Tahir, The Ex-Hubby, and I used to do that. But I don't anymore. It doesn't lead to anything. I must face the music and smell the coffee, and realise, he's probably laughing at me for all I know - so why bother. He's not worth my pain and tears. Neither does Sopian, The Jealous Ex-Boyfriend. Nobody is - and the person who is worth your tears, won't make you cry.
