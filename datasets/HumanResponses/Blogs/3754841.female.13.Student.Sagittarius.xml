      last night i had a dream-call it more of an adventure.. it was at my house, except that my house was like, haunted..old and spooky and stuff...unexplored ...my siblings and i had this quest.this house was a mansion belonging to a dead person...cobwebs here and there, you know, the usual spooky ambience,but it was that dark, we could still see things clearly.  we were supposed to look for small cicular things..like the ones with magnets at the back, the ones you ue for small board games.they were in purple, bright green, blue and pinkish-red. whenever we found one hidden in a nook or cranny we had to move them forward,just lift them up and move them,a secret opening would be formed on the ground..there would be some small object hidden in that opening.there was'nt any main reason for why there were clues, but anyway, we took them..we split up, my brother and my sister went together, my mum(she suddenly appeared) and i went together. there was once when we unveiled this piece of cloth and millions of black ants started crawling about..i got freaked out, and screamed(cause i'm afraid of ants). them after a while the dream ended.  it was really interesting going about, finding those things.there were many antiques, cobwebs, lots of furniture..it was as though someone had left those clues for us, that we were destined to get every single clue.   if i were really have to embark on an adventure like that, i'll go for it-as long as there is'nt anyone to harm me.  maybe you may have found this really dumb...but well, a dream is a dream, and it comes to you without you having to call it...and well, sometimes you'd just have to embrace it!

      yayy! all alone at home..sometimes it can be boring though...my life is boring...that's why right now i don't know what to type.i'm a flop at html so my blog would probably dull..  my dog skye ran away yesterday and wandered all the way to the row of shops near the main road...that's a LONG way actually..then when he was returning back he stuck his friendly nose at the gate of another's dog's house and got bit on the nose.blood was oozing out by the time he was brought home..he also wandered into the empty porch of a house on the way back...he's a curious fella, always trying to be friendly, but he does'nt know the outside world enough, the cruel, harsh world.   "Life's dirty. Life's unclean you know. It's birth, it's sex, it's the intestinal tract. One big squishy, unsanitary mess. It never gets any cleaner either. You know, dust to dust, worms crawl in, worms crawl out, right? Even though we know that, we still walk the walk, we still live the life. We're like a bunch of little kids. Little kids, you know, we jump in this big old pond of mud and we're slapping it all over our face, rubbing our hair all down our backs and we're making these glorious, gooey, mud pies. That's us."
