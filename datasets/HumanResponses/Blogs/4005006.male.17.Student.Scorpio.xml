       Well, its afternoon on my Mum's Birthday... Work was crap, but you'd expect that by now... he's given me one more chance, shame really... I now have £150 in the bag, I'd be relatively happy not having to even bother to go into work on Monday. We'll see how long I last eh??  I've been to the pub, fan-bloody-tastic fun. We had a curry take-away. I drank a lot. I started drinking at 4.30 when I'd got off work and found a bar, I went and got mum's CD - see previous posts - and I decided to drink some more. When I got home we had fun with Mum til we decided to go out to a friend's new restaurant. More drinking, canapés and socialising. Now I'm on, let me see... 4 cocktails, 3 glasses of wine. The restaurant looks great, really nice and friendly and great food, expensive, but great.  After that, I'm gettin drunk, I'm not thinking straight, I'm definitely not walking straight. My parents take me to a PUB!! Nuts... we meet up with friends, specifically Ronnie the poof, accented, rampantly homosexual and incredibly funny... moreso, incredibly drunk. We find him drinking his favourite tipple, double-vodka cokes. Nicely, my parents give me 2. Ronnie also buys me 2. FUCK! Drunk an awful lot, having a great blast.  Surprisingly I can still think and walk enough to fool parents into thinking I'm sober. We get home, have this lovely curry. I'm still drinking...  Sensing a trend here? I drink, a LOT... Archers was the next bottle I pulled out... eventually I collapsed on my bed in my shorts.  And that was the end of me.      Rambled post... but I'm writing this at the time... Half edited, half can't be bothered... this might be more fun just left as it is... let the comments roll in...

      Hi,   Aftermath of a broken heart My soul is torn, crawling in the dark. I search for answers I search for love I search for hope, blessing from above.    Sorry, breif poetical interlude. I've crawled out of the crawlspace to post some new updates to my blog, I wouldn't like anyone not to know whats goin on in my life:  1.02 PM - scratched ass 1.03 PM - blinked repeatedly 1.04 - 1.35 - moshed to Opeth "Black Rose Immortal" (actually is 30 mins long...)  Hehe!  Anyway, so... what to do now? Nowhere near so happy about things, my job is a complete shit hole, I can barely stand it anymore. All my friends are going away, havn't spoken to anyone properly for ages... Luckily I got peeps like Emma and Joe there to stick up for me. So, Thanks Joe, it wasn't as bad as all that really. We're still friends, and good ones I believe. I am glad for that, as it would be worse if things just stopped, and things disappeared  Yes, we're still friends, which is great, I wouldn't want it any other way. Ok, it hurts, it really hurts, and a lot of things I wish I didn't have to think about I now do... but at least I'm not hiding from them, much... and with people like Joe and Emma there to keep me sane, it will work...  All I've got to do is keep sane with this work deal... I've earnt myself £60 and will have £150 by the end of the week. If I last that long... he wants to fire me, he's always bitching and complaining. Ahh well... struggle on I will.   Will write again tomorrow. Hopefully  Dxx

      No Vacancy - Heal Me, I'm Heartsick  Heal me, I'm heartsick I'm hungry and I'm broken I'm haunted, and weeping The blood of heaven flowing like a river tonite, tears I can't fight on my own.  I'm a haunted heathen, I'm hung and barely breathing The drowning ocean, snuff the sun in motion. Theres a pill on my tongue, a shot from a gun , the bottles bottom I'm lonely as a star   So heal me, I'm heart sick Hungry, thought I could survive on you Heal my heartsick hungry cries I'm heartsick   Father, free me. mama , woman, feed me. Child of fury, lost his way but don't worry. I won't stop til the dawn, Though I'm in too long on the run I grow strong and restless as a storm.   So heal me, I'm heart sick Hungry, thought I could survive on you Heal my heartsick hungry cries I'm heartsick    *guitar solo*    Heal me I'm heart sick I'm hungry and I'm broken I'm haunted, and weeping The blood of heaven flowing like a river tonight Tears I can't fight on my own        Fun while it lasted Emma... So much I want to say, so very much I can't... maybe I will write later... all I've got in my head is " a pill on my tongue, a shot from a gun , the bottles bottom" it could be worse, I'm sure... but this is worse enough... every fucking thing I wish wouldn't happen, and wish wasn't true, suddenly is, once again... all the veils lifted, the wounds opened... I see clearly now  Bye.

       Wow... a glimpse into the world of the female... The unknown species... about which we think too much... Ahem. I've got to clean the whole girls changing room  I should be considering myself lucky... right??  However, its huge. Its beyond huge. Its gigantic! Its also oh so very messy, filthy dirty. Swathed in dust, dirt, grime, cobwebs.  And I have to clean it all on my own... Not a good deal.  Arrgh! Could things possibly get any worse?

       Still got another 2 weeks of this...   Only 9 days to go... right?? Its earning me £300... so its got to be worth it... right??  Shit, I'm soo tired and so knackered... my knees, my legs, my chest... I've been cleaning windows, scrubbing tables, hoovering floors, moving tables and chairs, sweeping, boucning to Linkin Park.... ok, so only one of those things was fun... and the boss, Mr Moon Lam-Nip (YES, that's his name) is worse than Hitler, Hitler just wanted to rule the world. Nip wants to destroy my body... its like bein raped by a fat black man... not that I've experienced it before...        Apparently hoovering on ur hands and knees cos ur 6ft3 and cant reach the sodding floor bending down constitutes as not working... well I'd like to see him trying to clean the damn celing without using a bloody chair.... *fume*       Anyway... I'm tired now... really tired, and I've got weeks left of this, so I wont be writing much at length, but hopefully will be posting lots of shorter things to fill up the spaces.     Peace and utter crippling knee pain.  Dxx

       Anyone who did appear here today, will notice that I wasnt posting much again... Another Runescape fest perhaps.    So.. I'm posting this in retrospect.    I went to church, which was exhillarating... I do love singing in church, it gives one an excuse to belt out loud hymns in a a large room and not be stared at too much as everyone else is doing the same. What's funny is listening to the old men with really deep booming voices singing the traditional hymns as if they were the national anthem, with their hands on their hearts, staring at the cross, with tears streaming down their faces... I like going church also as I don't do it enough, it feels special, when I do, like God recognizes my presence, that I am being absolved my many sins... I'm sure thats the whole point... but thats  not  the point...hehe!    All I wanted to do after that was to go home and play Runescape and chat on MSN, but  NO , mum had to go to the shops.. so as a punishment I said I wanted to drive, the bad news, I didnt crash, or kill anyone... which makes a change from my usual 3 blocks of people massacred and 38908 car pile-ups.  Staring my new job tomorrow. Erk. Early start, and its my bloody  HOLIDAY!  Nuts...    &nbsp;  So I&nbsp;guess I'd better get some rest     Dxx    Hope this makes up for my lack of&nbsp;proper posting yesterday... not that anyone other than&nbsp;me is reading this really.  &nbsp;

       Not written so much today as I would like, I've been playing Runescape all day.  urlLink http://www.runescape.com  for a really cool online role playing game. I've been playing for ages and I find it really fun, it has a cool community, and a fair share of utter loosers, one of which screwed me out of a nice new sword I wanted to buy...   However, that is besides the point, and boring for anyone (most of you) who will have no clue what the hell I am on about. At the home front, parents have errected a water feature in the garden, which looks nice surrounded by lots of brown soil - England is soo good at the dreary colours such as brown, its untrue! - and not much else, but I'm sure a lot of pretty flowers will apear there soon... or maybe not.. depends on what Jane - Sam's mum - decides to do in the space.     &nbsp;   Tomorrow I am serving at church... yay my weekly dosage of church going, singing and rejoicing in a religous fashion... I however cannot be arsed to get up, God surely can understand my prayers when I'm asleep... right?    Ahh anyway, so thats tomorrow...   On a side note, I am extremely hungry... I've not eaten anything other than a piece or two of cheese and a bacon sandwich... hopefully food is upcoming.   Too hungry to write more, catch me on MSN.   Dxx     &nbsp;

       Well, good morning. I'm not hungover, this is rather impressive!    Sam is gone, my room is a tip. This happens a lot. I've been cleaning up to the soft sounds of the epic Opeth! Yes, i know that there's&nbsp;a contradiction between soft sounds and epic... its what one calls a juxtaposition.  Not much to do for the rest of the day, probably get down to writing some more poetry or perhaps writing a story or three. We will have to see.     &nbsp;   Ohh good god, its just got to the double bass-pedal beat on "Nectar" and the shredding solo... I love this song, its beautiful. Download it if you can, its 10 minutes of aural bliss. Vicious as it is beautiful, like a rose.     &nbsp;   Ohh that I could play guitar like that, but alas I cannot.   Signing off for now, can't be bothered to write and not fully listen to Opeth at the same time. Bye!

       Hi,     &nbsp;   Well... I've been going out with this girl&nbsp;for 3-4 days now. I should still be ecstatic. I'm not. You see, shes possibly the greatest chance I've got of having a brilliant and beautiful girl who cares about me. I don't deserve someone like her by my side. I'm ugly, pathetic, a complete bastard. I wish I could explain it... I'm writing it all down, for the whole world to read if they really want to... feel free to laugh and point at the looser in my comments if you wish.   Today she tells me of someone else she likes,&nbsp;a friend, a male friend. Sure, no problem, she can have male friends, I wouldnt dare stop her. I'm not jealous or envious or anything like that. I told her that as long as she says she loves me, I will trust her and I will believe her and I will always love her back... thats how I feel... but what I also can't help feeling is that this guy is probably a million times better for her than me.   He's going to be better looking, he's going to be more her age, and probably nearer to her than I am. No contest. I'm a fucking minger. Just go look on my profile! I'm 17 going out with a 14 year old, how many of you out there are going to say that I'm some kind of sick pedophile? I live in Kent, near Tunbridge Wells (UK) while she lives 200 miles away near Birmingham. It costs 40-50 quid to get up there or for her to get down here, I can't yet drive and as discussed previously, I SUCK!&nbsp; Who knows if we would EVER see eachother.   The problem? I love her, I can't stop thinking of her, I don't want to lose her... but if she would be happier with someone else, who am I to stop her? What's the point really? I've never KNOW the happiness I've felt reecently since we met.  Now. I am Sad. I don't quite know what to do. I dont know if she will read this or not. I don't know if I will talk to her about this in future. It's nice to see that once again God has filled me with a doubt, a sadness, possibly a test to see how I will react. Probably a fucking punishment for... oh well I'm sure you can guess.   Anyone with any ideas, comments, suggestions, or if you just wanna kick the shit out of me for being such a sad-case... feel free.   Currently listening to David Hodges - Breahte (Featuring Amy Lee). Lovely piano ballad.   Anyway, I'm depressed, I won't have another chance like this, I feel like I've already blown it. Here's to another 17 years of waiting and sadness and loneliness probably. So, I'm going to get drunk on Bailey's and Tequilla and Whiskey and Archers...   Night. Dxx

       Just finished watching "School of Rock" (for the&nbsp;sixth&nbsp;time)&nbsp;a great film by Mike White directed by Richard Linklatter. I would suggest that anyone who hasn't seen it, see it. Anyone who has seen it, see it again. Anyone who has seen it many times, good work, you may rest at ease!   To educate you : It stars Jack Black and Mike White. Black plays a failed rocker who takes the identity of his flatmate Mr Schneabley a substitute teacher and proceeds to train up his prep-school class to be in a rock band to play at the&nbsp;Battle of the Bands.   Throughout the film are classic gags and brilliant comedy from Jack Black, including his ad-libbed songs and wacky facial expressions. The characters are believable; White's girlfriend is incredibly annoying and the headmistress Mrs Mullins is typical youthfull rocker made bitch through stress and the cast of children that make up the band and crew are cool and watching their transformation at the hands of the wild Dewy Finn (Black) is quite impressive.   Overall, a must-see film. Great for the familly as much as the "hardcore" musicians.   On another note... Spyk Thomas' Blog is now up and running, since I prodded him senseless to make one, at  urlLink http://spykshit.blogger.com . Check it out, it promises to be more random and even less structured than my own.     &nbsp;   Gonna end this here, been writing this far too long... Will probably edit this when I have little or nothing to do.     &nbsp;   Dxx

       Well, it's the afternoon... I've made it this far!   I've had a driving lesson, which went well all except for the fact that I suck!    Hopefully I will take my theory test soon, but there is as much chance of that happening as there is of Sam actually doing an honest weeks work.   Sam is my very best friend, utterly insane, like a piece of cheese or possibly llama excrement... Love him loads, except for when I don't. He's here right now, playing Spiderman 2 for XBOX which I wholly advocate you all playing.   I'm shocked that I'm not listening to any music. Ahh, ok, Frankie Miller - Caledonia. Nice guitar solo.   Ohh, and for anyone who's interested... Claire is out of hospital and is home...&nbsp; Very glad of this fact. I'm currently speaking to her on MSN and she seems to be rather good all things considered.     &nbsp;   Remind me to post up the poem she wrote... sad and depressive maybe, but I think its very beautiful.     &nbsp;   Later,   Dxx      EDIT - Added Sam as a member to the website as a joint member. Want to see his contributions and wacky comments to my own publishings... So, beware! (19.38 - July 23 2004)

       Ok, well I've just woken up... Showered. Dried. Crawled to my computer, signed into MSN.. "You have 4 New Email Messages".. oh great, junk-mail, pornography, annoying chainletters.  No.  4 identical messages... Panic starts to set in, what could it be "Some Sad News About ------" scared now i read on in horror about my friend who has suffered horrible things throughout their life and how last night made their worst attempt at committing suicide yet....  I'm pretty shocked by all of this, very worried about my friend. I ask that anyone who reads this post their condolences to my friend, who prays that she gets well from the hospital ward where she is being force fed, on drips and bloodfeeds.   Anyway... bit different mood compared to that of my last post eh? Will write later.

       Interesting, my first blog...    &nbsp;  Hello! I dont much expect anyone else to be reading this so I might as well be talking to myself, its currently eleven o'clock, my bro and his friend have just gone to bed probably to smoke themselves tupid on illegal narcotics. I'm sitting here dripping wet in a green towell from a late bath listening to "The Show Must Go On" by Queen.  There's an orange light flashing on the MSN Messenger window... ohh great, my web "girlfriend" who is 12 or something and thinks im "fit" is trying to talk to me... wonder if she'll accuse me of cheating on her or not...    Ohh, now listening to one of my favourite artists... David Hodges... if you havn't heard of him he used to be in Evanescence and helped write a lot of their material for the first album... he writes solo material of a Christian theme, lots of it featuring the vocals of Amy Lee  Im almost certain that I've ranted on for too long... probably giving you all many questions you'd like to ask, well I'll hopefully be answering them as we go. I'm quite a weird and wacky and funny person if you get to know me.  Anyway, I'm loosing the plot... Will write again tomorrow \ later \ when I can be arsed!  Much Love  Dxx

       Today I get my exam results.   At 10.00 I've been sitting here since 6.00   The wait is killing me. I'm not expecting to do very good. I pray that I will have done some good at least, but who knows?  Argh, this is really bad! I'm listening to David Hodges, genius man. Not taking my mind off of things though. Typical.      Well, I'll speak again when I'm back. Dxx

      My friend Claire, who I first spoke about a few weeks ago, has reecently been in an out of hospital, with the same problems, she has succumbed to several cardiac-arrests and is seriously physically and mentally unwell at the moment... I fear for her sanity and for her life... I would ask anyone who sees this to spare a thought for her, post a comment, a message of get well. Spare a few moments to pray for her, for she needs an awful lot of help.  Thanks. Dxx

       Yes... I've had a 3 day hangover...  No. I just couldn't be bothered to write. I've been so tired, I'm STILL tired. I've been to work for one day, and I feel like I've been working for weeks. Least today was really good... I cleaned the whole damn place till it was immaculate, I'm doing the boys changing rooms now... and I tell you, they're so much cleaner than the girls, by an incredible long shot.  I've been able to finish the boys changing rooms in 2 days compared to the girls in 4... you gals are all messy pigs, clean and innocent and pure my ass... lesbian sex and explicit bondage rituals re-enacted over the large floors I'll bet!       Or is it in my dreams..........?  Anyway, the boys rule, you girls are sick!! Still got another few days of this, my God did I not want to clean this morning, I was hoping and hoping that I would be sent home, I was praying that I might be fired during the day as I didn't want to clean in future... I spent the morning thinking of alternative jobs. Thats how bad things have got.  I just hate myself, feeling so crap. I can't clean, I can't do the most simple of tasks, the most basic, not exercising a single brain cell properly, and I  sucked  at it!! Really damaging to my self-confidence, what little I have. After Emma and all... I feel like I'm worth shit. Can do fuck all... Hehe... Perfect. I'm all alone to say this to no-one.      See you later guys. Fin and his friends are around, gonna go drown my sorrows.      Dxx
