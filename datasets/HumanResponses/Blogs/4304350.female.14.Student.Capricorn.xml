      Ah, and this is my first time using Blogger. I'm not quite sure how this works, and when I try to view my blog, it says it's not available. I guess I'll figure it out.  My name is Catherine Grace, all my first name. I've thought about hyphenating it because be shorten it all the time. But such is life, I suppose. I'm starting highschool this year. Almost all honor courses, which I hate saying. I'm a perfectionist at times, and I want to say "All-Honors." But I missed a lot of school during 8th grade. Forty-six days, I believe. People thought I had cancer. In fact, that was the big rumor, but around me, it was all hush-hush. Ach, but then I started failing in classes, understandably so. And near the end of the year, I brought them up, except for that darn math. I was in the advanced class, Algebra I, and missing so much, I got completely lost and just frustrated myself. I got a tutor and he helped a lot, but it was too late to bring my grade up from an 'F.' So I would have to take the average of the two semesters, and 'A' and an 'F' and would have to carry a 'C' over to highschool, affecting my graduating GPA. Now that I write this, I realize I did the right thing by taking Algebra I again instead of having the 'C' on my record and taking Geometry Honors and getting all confused again. I am though, in the highest available classes for English and science, or Integrated Chemistry/ Physics. I hope to start this year off well, because for the last four years, my attendance has not been great and this year it is especially important because five days missed results in loss of credit.  I want to be a forensic scientist or a detective, but I'm not sure I could handle the blood and guts at crime scenes if I become the latter. I read mysteries, and fiction of the like, but a lot of non-fiction too, to learn about profiling criminal minds and such. It is no surprise then, when I say that my favorite subject is science. Ah, and how I love science. And logic as well. Not so much the analyzing side, but just using common sense, like Sherlock Holmes. I like to piece things together (including jigsaw puzzle, oddly enough) and I enjoy the feeling of satisfaction after I solve a crime in one of those "5 Minute Mystery" books, though I rarely do. I usually cheat and look up the answer and say to myself "Ach, and I would've thought of that in a minute or so!" I guess my language sounds funny. It sure looks funny, looking at all my "Ah's" and "Ach's." But that's what you get when you read as much as I do. I pick up the language style and start talking olden-like or whatnot. It's quite odd, I guess, to other people. But I am sure not from this time. If I wasn't such a devout Atheist, I'd say I was a soul from another era. Well, a few years back anyways...  My idols. Ah, my idols! (Again with the 'ah's'.) If there was a mortal God ever on this planet, it would be Paul Simon. No, not the politician who recently died. The musician. The genius. The other half of me. He can express his feelings like he knows exactly how I feel. They say that if you were depressed in the 60s, you listened to Paul Simon, or then Simon and Garfunkel. That stands true for me today, as I am a lonesome teenager, aged 14, who suffers from manic depression/bi-polar disorder. Twas the reason I was sick 40-some days last year. Not so much sick physically, but mentally. And can you believe it, they're suing me for truancy, complaining that I missed school a for a few days after I literally passed out in the hallway right on my face! And guess when the court hearing is? DURING SCHOOL? How absurd! What fools!  Back to my idols. Simon is part of me. I feel he is a long lost love. And no one understands this. My friends say I have a crush on a 60-year-old man. And I always joke around about it with them and say, "No, he is a few years past 60 now."  But I feel the strangest thing when I hear him sing, or strum, or talk.  And I swear that every love song was written for me. I am crazy, am I not? Yet it is true. I am in love with Paul Simon. It is so unbelievably odd to me. I can't quite explain. He is my soul mate. I would say 'Drat his wife!' but I do want him to be happy. And if he ever found out anything I felt, he'd suggest an asylum for me. But at the same time, I want him to know. I'm writing Oprah now, begging my pitiful story if only she will let me meet him. But he would think I was obsessed, and I admit that I am, to an extent. I am so much in awe of him, though, that I have tried to play nearly every song of his on piano and guitar, and made awful attempts at writing songs. I had some pretty good ideas for songs, but I could never make it turn out right. I almost bought "Songwriting for Dummies," but I figure if youre not born with it, you're not born with it. And, GOD, was he born with it.  Enough of that obsession. I love the Everly Brothers. And despite popular vote, I am in love with PHIL Everly, not Don. I can not find out Phil's middle name, but I find it interesting, and somewhat eerie, that Don's initials spell 'D.I.E.' Donald Issac Everly. The 'cute one.' And can you not tell by now that my tastes are different? I think Paul Simon is adorable now and he is 62 now, if I'm not mistaken. And my old Phil (and I talk of him as if he is a dear friend), how I adore him. There is not a biography anywhere that I can find of the Everly Brothers. All I know is the break-up and Don's drug abuse. I know Phil has two sons, and Don one, but how reliable was that source anyway. It's probably wrong. But nonetheless, I do believe that Phil was scarred by everyone liking Don more than himself, as is evident in his song "When Will I Be Loved?" It is a piteous cry to my ears, and probably only mine. But I hear him hurting when I listen to that song. Everyone wants Don. Hmm, or so I have come to understand. But I am glad that after their nasty break-up of which I have heard that they have come to be friends, and most importantly, brothers again. I saw them touring with Simon and Garfunkel. But if I have to say one thing about the show, I would mention poor old Simon, who was not enjoying it at all. At least not that one show he did that I attended. Whereas Artie was up and talking and waving to the crowd, saying things like, "How are you guys here in Chicago?" and such. And Paul, he hung back around the stage, and only spoke to introduce a song once, and once again to correct Artie in some humorous mistake he made in telling a tale of the history of a song they were about to sing. I was never sure if Paul meant to be a snob or simply point out the mistake to keep him from looking a fool.  I hope it was the latter, and I certainly hope that the rest of their tour has turned out better than it seemed to be when I saw them.  Ah, and here comes Step-dad yelling. It it's midnight now, and I must retire for the night. Good night, or Good "blank" to whatever time it is when I have someone reading this. Please send me feedback; I could use a good online friend. Similar tastes not a necessity, but preferred.  Thanks Again, Catherine Grace
