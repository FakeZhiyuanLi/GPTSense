      omg! this is the last week for pleasure i the computer lab for me. next week will be *hell*. TRIAL SPM! God, how times fly..  yesterday, mom, dad, bros and sis came to visit. KC (my beloved sis) brought along a cd with a copy of my fav mp3's, her new fan art and FFX-2 story movie. too bad i did't brought it along now, then i'd be watching the movie and not web surfin'...  i got the fever and annoying flue today too. i feel good about it for i haven't got any fever for the year (=^.^=) i love falling sick, except for my asthma attack. it's nightmare for me.  this is the first pic i'd try to post in a blog now.. one of my sis great works with her pencil..

      *sigh*... i cried again in Add Math class.. it's not the most un-usual thing to me 'coz i cried everytime i didn't&nbsp;quite catch up like others did.. physics class are the worst! even the my teacher had my name on the black list. i can't&nbsp;put up my mind of&nbsp;what the h*ll she want to make me understand. gomenn... i'm being a bit psycho right now.. bad mouth!  well, sadly, i cant open MoonFantasy anymore. it got banned again. so i'm stuck writing this no-one-would-read and lame-to-death blog.. cant life be a bit more interesting?  &nbsp;

      this would be my very first try. i found out about this blogging from the star paper.&nbsp;so, forgive me if you found it too lame. i'll be needing guidance from those who would teach me a thing or two about blogging. about the layouts or anything...  today would be the best day of the week. first, i've found my long lost favourite forum back. Greyfairy.net was my first anime forum with post up to (about to reach) 200. my school is starting to put username in every computer and password too. that means i can freely surfing the web anytime (aside from prep. times) i want =^.^= plus, the moonfantasy forum which had been banned by the server is available too. that's why i'm so hype today.  exams is nearing, i can smell it. beginning of august, to be exact. God! SPM is all bunch of hard subjects. i dont think i can cope with the stress anymore. all i ever wanted to do right&nbsp;now is to be out from this uniforms, this school and school-life.
