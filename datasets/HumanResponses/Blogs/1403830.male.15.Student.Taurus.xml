      So, looking back a day or so, remember how I said I got in a fight with my mother?  About my lack of responsibility and generally useless-ness; lest we not forgot laziness as well.  so I woke up today, and when I awoke, I awoke with purpose.  a purpose to do things correctly, to put others before self, and to generally take every cliché I could and stuff it into my panties.  Well, this was somewhat accomplished; instead of getting up at my usual 12:30 pm, I awoke at 10:00.  I then proceeded to make breakfast, and GASP even cleared my plate and put it in the dishwasher.  my mother, the fine woman that she is, then decided to call me on the telephone.  when I answered, she inquired as to whether it would be to my liking if we went to the first ever farmers market in Bellevue, and then went to her work so I could help her.  normally, I would weigh these 2 options, the 2 options being  a.  staying at home; which consists of: -	watching TV -	a lot of aim  -	web surfing  -	masturbation  -	and the like and b. going to my mothers work, which would involve none of the previously described hedonistic activities, and would result in me doing crafts meant for 6 year olds to see if they would work for her "customers", but don’t forget,  today, today my friends, was different.  so, it was with those fleeting images that I meekly agreed to dress myself, change my diabetes supplies and turn off the computer, and venture out into the unknown.  when I arrived, I tried to be as courteous as possible  “mother, can I help with this or that?”  I carried back all of her bags from the farmers market and placed them ever-so gently into her trunk, then proceeding onto her work, I spent 3 hours making tissue paper flowers to make sure that they were not hard for the children  when this was done, I came home.  but  just when I thought my trials and tribulations were over, I was summoned again  this time it was to give the dog fresh water  no, never mind the fact that you are four feet away and could fill it up yourself, it is much more efficient for you to summon your son, who is located 1 story and a flight of stairs below you, to do said deed  and I obliged, I came up and filled that water dish to the best of my abilities. not 1 drop was spilled, and it was placed back on the ground with grace not seen in times like today well, continuing on my courteous kick, I asked if the table had been set  why no, my mom replied, a smug grin invading her upper facial region  well I said, maybe I should do that then  maybe you should she said  so I remove the utensils from their respective drawers, fold the napkins and pour the beverages.  it is at this point, with my task completed, that my mom tells me that she wished to dine outside on the deck  this poses a conundrum the outside table, left unused for the winter  has acquired what many would refer to as "filth"  thus, it was unfit for food to be consumed upon but, do not let that worry you; of course it would be my delight to spend 1 half hour in the blazing sun wiping that table off, and then resetting it  with all that done and accounted for, I was, mad, yet satisfied with my efforts  wanting to face the trees, I asked my brother if I could have the spot that overlooked our yard  this request was met with a "Sam I really want to sit there too, sorry, should’ve asked sooner"  yes Nate, whatever you please.  when I was done  I cleared his plate, and my mothers, and everything that was out on the table  I then put everything in the dishwasher  I then ran the dishwasher  at this point  I was heated  and retreated back to my room to escape from the retardedness of my family but wait it gets better after thinking about it for a while I realized that not once during the entire day had anyone thanked me for giving up my time to help them : whether it was at my mom's work, or through my tireless kitchen chores I thank my mom when she does the slightest thing but no, a simple, thanks Sam is too much to muster after an hour of being removed from the situation I am summoned once again this time by my father who had just arrived home from Chicago there was no hello son or, my trip was grand, was your day swell? no, I was greeted with a "Sam, sit down" I proceeded to park my derriere in a seat at the dining room table  which still possessed the placemats I had set upon it just a few hours earlier for the next 20 minutes I was inundated with reasons why I wasn’t good enough, especially concerning my grades this left me speechless I had worked my ass off in every one of those classes I had raised all my grades to b's, except in Spanish, in which the teacher specifically said that I had been working just as hard, and just wasn’t getting it now, if anyone else had said this to me my mother, for example anyone other than my father I would’ve ripped into them I would’ve yelled like there was no tomorrow no, but here I sat listening to my father telling me that I wasn’t someone that colleges want the only words I spoke during this verbal tirade were  "dad, um, I'm in 9th grade?" his response to this was impressive as I sat there, and watched him yell at me about disrespect, laziness, how the test scores must be wrong because they say I’m smart, and to him I’m a dumb fuck I bit my lip the entire time and it bled by the end at the end of his performance he asked me Sam I’m not mad at you a single tear dripped down my cheek Sam, I’m not mad, I just want you to understand that you need to try harder.  I’m not asking you to get straight a's I’m asking you to get b's, b+'s, a-'s, that sort of thing so Sam does it make sense? I shook my head and said no, and left the table as I left he yelled come back her goddammit I want to talk to you no I’m not coming back dad and I’m not an angry adolescent you're just a fucked up old man no there was no mention of  1- Sam pulled up 3 of his grades 2- there’s three paragraphs in my history comment about how nice I am to other people about how honest and courteous I am no he took the only nice point in the English comment that I am quick with words and told me it was because I was dumb it was all I had to rely on so dad, I’m through well 2 hours later instead of him coming down to talk to me he yells at me from the stairs Sam come up here you need to do a blood sugar test ok ill do one later no you will do one know fine so  I get up I comply I walk past him as I enter the kitchen "Sam, I want you to know that I said that because I love you" silence  "and that I said it because I felt that this is a time for you to make changes" silence "Sam, give me a hug" he reaches in to give me a hug "dad, I don’t have to give you a hug" Sam come back here and give me a hug dammit no I didn’t I just walked out of the room so dad how was your trip? and that’s it that’s how I feel about life

      So there's this thing called motivation, and I don't have any.  I suppose it's fine; it's summer and if I want to I can sleep in all day.  But I don't want to.  There are things I want to do.  I just don't know what.  I think that this is the problem.  I feel empty, like I'm in a holding pattern, or I'm out of the loop, and then I wonder why I'm not motivated to do anything.  It's probably that I don't know what I'm doing, so I'm not going to see the end goal.    I had a fight with my mom yesterday.  I was at Steve's, watching a movie with him and Eli, and she said she was going to pick me up at 9:00.  Too early, but I try to make it easy, she's the one doing me the favor.  Steve's street is set up so that there's a place that has his same address but it's a block up.  Long story short, she drove around for an hour looking at me from 9:00-10:00.  I don't know why this woman hates me.  Hold on, let me clear my throat.  I do.  I am -not responsible -lazy -irresponsible -lazy -not responsible -bad -spoiled -lazy -irresponsible  in her eyes.  Why don't you do this and that is all that she tells me.    She wants her little boy back,  I want to come back.  But I can't, because everytime I make peace with her, I end up making things worse, and feeling like I'm wasting my time. So, here I go, off to try and meet your demands again.  Let's see how long it lasts.  -scs

      I am beat.  Like falling over beat.  And I am nowhere close to the finish line.  I am stumbling.  I am there, I am waiting.  For who?  For you, the one that called me tonight.  You spent the night, but not at my house.  Understandable, judging from our conversation.  "Oh, but I would..."  No, you wouldn't.  You don't give a fuck.  So quit your masquerading, take off your mask.  And turn away.  Walk away.  And come back when you need me, lord know I'll be here, for you or not.

      Ok, here's the deal:  I've switched from LiveJournal to Blogger.  Why, you ask?  Well, there are a couple of reasons.  First, I had a blogger account a long time before I had a LJ account.  I always liked Blogger, and since they updated with all of these new features, I figured I would go back and give it a try.  2.   urlLink Tony Pierce  told me to go from LJ to Blogger.  Since  urlLink Tony Pierce  is really one of the only people I would listen to even though I have never met him in person, I decided to come back to Blogger.  All of this must sound really silly.  But, don't be sad, children, for there is hope.  I have created a syndication of my Blogger account that you LJ users can subscribe to.  This way, I'll still show up in your friends page, and you can still leave comments.  Talk to me if you have any questions.  -samshapiro

      I wonder if she knows the effect she was on me  I wonder if she knows that everytime she writes or calls  I forget what I'm doing  And pay all my attention to her  But I guess practice makes perfect  And she makes me wanna be  Sometimes I think she's testing me  But I don't know for what  I just wish we were together

      What do you love?  What is love?  How does one define it?  Its funny too  Love, that is  One day your sitting out on your porch, drinking a soda (or a beer, if  your looking for that grizzled, gritty look)  And they are telling you  Yeah you could get with her  Yeah you probably could  But the question is  Why?  Why would you want to get with her?  Well here's my answer  Fuck you.  It goes from that  To I'll look into it  And then you actually look into it  Because you are a desperate, crazy, son of a bitch  And you realize  That you like her  And that you'd be up late one night  Telling her that you like her  And you're actually self confidant  You lost 15 pounds  And you still dress fly  Not that fly  No gucci suits  No prada  No fendi  Well, your glasses  are fendi  And you realize  That your only gonna be happy  When you can wear a hanes beater and some champion sweats  And feel like your rockin evisu and some j's  Because maybe she wil make you feel like that  And you hope she will  And you think its funny that she goes  You have some balls  Gotta love that

      I just watched love and basketball.  And it changed my life.  I'm sitting there, thinking  Take her back  Take her back  Take her back you dumb motherfucker.  And he doesn't  And in the end  Its like  Love finds a way.  And its beautiful.  But what it captures  Is the heartbreak  The time spent waiting  Thinking  Wondering  Will she ever call  Did she mean that  And then  Happy ending  And it just made me want to talk to her more  I'm gonna quit my job  Gimmie my paycheck  All I want  Is for her to love me back  Like in the movie  I want her to knock on my window at 3 am  And be like  We need to talk  I would be like  Mmmhmm yeah we do  And then I would tell her how much I loved her  Roll credits  But she already knows  That's why I'm there  All the time  Fuck I miss her  I miss the talks  The reassurance  The oh shit I can't believe I just said that  So if your reading  And you know who you are  I love you  I miss you  And I'm sorry.  And you'll never know how much I care about you.  And  And  And  if you counted the number of times I cried over you  You'd need to use your fingers and your toes  And this is sam  Crying  Doesn't happen.  I play the stoneface  Ice cold  Type of thing  Not the touchy feely  Sweater vest wearing  Type of thing  But I would  I would for you  I might even eat a peanut butter and pickle sandwich for you  But only if I knew I'd be getting some  And you'd need to bring a friend  But the thing about you is  I never wanted to fuck you  I never jacked off to you  I just wanted to sit  And talk  And hold you  And I don't think that will ever happen with us  But if you want  Call  24 hours a day  Because  Simply  I'm in love with you

       its worse when all your friends have these great relationships with these awesome chicks and they r tighter than spandex and your sitting at home on your computer thinking about how you fucked up every single one of your chances at love, and then you think about drowning it all in shitty beer but realize your too lazy to go upstairs and get one, and then the tears turn to anger, and then to just plain dispair and desperation, and then you write this to a girl on im who you talk to because you need someone to listen but you really dont know her and the only reason you talk to her is because shes cute and you feel like you deserve to talk to cute chicks as opposed to ugly ones because, well, god damn it you have a reputation to uphold, and then u start to see that its all in your head and no one cares about your self pity or lack of self confidance or your anything, and that your just not shit

       urlLink    I've got a confession.  I'm not having the greatest summer.  Sure its nice, it's fun to hang out with friends and work and make a  little money.  But its nothing special.  I already went out of town, and that wasn't that great.  I came back.  I still feel alienated from the group sometimes.  But whatever.  I don't want to go back to lakeside at all.  I don't want to play football.  I had a goal for this summer  And that was to meet someone who I really cared about  And so far that hasn't happened  And trust me  Its not from lack of trying  New topic  I crossed the line into metrosexualism yesterday  I went shopping at express  And I actually bought something  Gay guys are funny  Kinda creepy and have wierd voices, but funny.  That was a big generalization.  Sue me.

      This can't be life    This can't be love    Thank you sean carter    So I was talking to her last night    And I thought to myself    Do conversations really get this 1 sided?    Does she realize how much more I care about talking to her than she does   to me?    I could've stopped right there    No wait    I probably couldn't have    She's like crack    Addictive    I couldn't  sit there and be like    "Jesus sam snap out of it get over it"    Boyz 2 men was not going to write a song about this one    Well maybe    But only if it was one of those sexy, put this on before you rip off my   clothes type songs    And I highly doubted it would be.    Never see her    Never talk to her.    Well sometimes    Hell this image of perfection that I associate with her    Could be    Probably is    Just a figment of my imagination    I hear sirens outside of my window    A funny thing    Considering outside of my window is the most comfortable place to be in   my house.    God I hate this feeling    Because you never know what's going on and then you realize that its   just you, and you suck.    So I'm out.

      july has to be my favorite month  i love sleeping outside in the hammock  butt ass naked  and waking up whenever i feel like it  and then i have stuff to do, off to work  but u dont show  so i wait  overdressed and uder slept  overpaid for nothing  going back to lakeside  and seeing those kids  and hearing his i got with her in the shower story  made me remember how much i hate lakeside  its just a whole bunch of cocky rich kids  trying to one up each other  i said that that was the reason i hated lakeside girls  and kevin said he didnt hate them  and i said that was the reason  i said that because they dont hate kevin they have less time to not hate me  maybe im just jealous  fuck maybe  im am jealous  and im tired of being immature  and of my friends being mad at me  and i think i might have a new crush  but maybe  maybe i should just get drunk right now  and squash that before i start to obsess about her  and before i start asking her every weekend what shes doing  and before the awkward silences  shit  maybe ill grow up  get rich  live in a condo overlooking the city  and ill wear a bathrobe with my initials on it  and ill smoke a pipe  and i will not be loved  because i went through life looking for it and never found it  and i came back a bitter, hardened man  and i became ruthless  and i just hired hookers when i needed sex  and inside i was sad  but on the outside  you can put a gun to my head and i wont flinch  because thats how cool i am, cool under  fire  i hate it when u have to see new sides of people  when its not something u wanna know  but itll come up  i hate how i feel like shit whenever i tell a joke   and i hate that i cant accept that someone can just laaugh  i hate the shoeboxes on my floor  i hung out and went shopping with her  shes as fleety as my writing  bobbing  and weaving  not knowing,  but not showing or telling  where her pedicured toes would take her  only sure  that id be at her side  friends in the back  and then i realized  this is all a dream  she doesnt want this  im just the one she comes to for advice and to vent  i am to her what i am to every other girl  im the good friends guy  and im good friends, but nothing more  like sherman from american pie  "we had one of those, like, amazing deep conversations.  we sat up until 3 in the morning just talking"  i hear u sistah  i want to have one of those  but it would eventually have to lead to sex  because everyone knows that if u wanna get laid, just mask it and ull get some  from some ugly bitch  and then  then cry  because ur life  no its not a mess  its just sorry, boring and pathetic  and most of all  ur work  ur art  ur life  is unappreciated  and then  then u r the man

      I can't sleep  Its 2:37  I have work in 7 and a half hours.  And I begin to see the demise of my life  I just don't care enough about anything.  Fuck, I could leave lakeside this summer and never look back.  I could  never see people from there again.  And not to say that I don't like you, I have friends there.  But I just don't love you enough to not leave you.  Same with my family; sure I'd be depressed for a while, but I wouldn't  fight it.  And maybe that's my problem.  By not being attached so strongly to anything, I'm really just nothing,  nothing really defines me.  We are what we know and what we do.  And we usually know what we do, and do what we know.  But what happens if your knowledge is scattered throughout a whole bunch  of different things?  There's no job opening that says multiple choice  on the nameplate.  And if there's one thing I've noticed, I'm sick of fucking noticing.  I'm sick of this pusedo-hippie bullshit that makes me have to be fucking  in touch with my feelings.  And I hate how I follow it.  I hate how thinking blows things out of proportions.  Just because she laughs doesn't mean she wants to suck your dick.  And I'm done with all of you.  I'm sick of your attitudes.  I'm done with the unappreciative bullshit.  I don't know where I'll go, but it sure as hell aint here.  I wanna go somewhere where the brunettes wear green and pink and the  blondes have deep voices and shallow eyes, and where her frivolous  smile  Is only one  Disguise  muscle said chalk it up to achohol  Maybe I will ryan, maybe I will.

      Let me tell you about the summer of my discontent  I have done nothing  I did nothing in the sense that I didn't do anything worth talking about  when the teachers ask us about our summer.  "Sam, what did you do on your vacation?"  "Well, I lost 25 pounds by basically not eating, went running most days  because I felt like I had to do something good for myself, worked at a  job that made me come home and bitch about it, only to go back the next  day.  And probably the biggest thing I did this summer was not getting  with kendall, and not telling her how I felt about her."  "What?   You didn't tell her?"  That's how I think the conversation would go.  Its one of those things where you value the actual act of liking her too  much to actually tell her how you feel.  Actually your just too damn scared that she'll think your a stalker and  never talk to you again.  That's a problem when you've built her up in your mind to be this dark  haired goddess with the cute eyes and the viscous smile.  Maybe I'm being immature about this.  Maybe I'll get one of my friends  to ask her out for me like we used to do in 5th grade. Ok, probably not,  but maybe I should just let this burn out until I don't like her  anymore, all feelings don't need to lead to a relationship.  People say I'm immature.  I'm fat.  Unfunny.  Slow.  Not awesome.  To  this, I say your right, I am all of those things.  In fact I'd be  hard-pressed to find 1 positive thing about myself for every 3 negative  things I said.  But I am happy with where I am right now.  I'm doing  things for me.  I wish I could be like you, easily amused.

      What do we have in common?  Hopefully we both like her (unless she's full of self hate)  Ashlee simpson  Chilling on the lake  I can't think of anything else.  For how much I like her  I should know more about her  Or maybe we should just have more in common  Or maybe  We should say fuck formalities  And get together and have a lot of kids  And then I could be like now we have somthing in common  And sure  We might be labeled as trailer trash  But love conquers all  Even trailer trash  Sometimes I wish what I said was true  Like when I talk about how hot I am  Or how I have to fend off girls by the masses  That's the stuff that's supposed to be funny but its actually kinda sad  Because its kist an attempt for me to put all my insecurities on the  table  Maybe I'll scare them off one day

      I realize the error of my ways  I tend to overdue things  Lets take football, for example.  Lifting 5 days a week in the off season  Constantly talking to my dad and friends about it  Researching cleats  Etc..  Sometimes you just need to suck it up  Say fuck it to all the extra baggage that comes with it  And actually do something  And I know no one will understand this  But this whole overdoing it  Ends up fucking everything up  Because it just isn't fun anymore when you do something all the time  Whatever  I hate my job
