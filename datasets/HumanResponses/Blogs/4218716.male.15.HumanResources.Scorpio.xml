      Well, today has been my first day of high school, now as a sophomore. I am too tired to type coherently, I probably should've followed my own advice in the last post too. Oh well. Here's a break-down of my course schedule:  A - Day  1st   Spanish III 2nd  World History AP 3rd  Theatre Art I (blagh =P) 4th  Algebra II  B - Day  5th  AP Computer Science I 6th  Chemistry 7th  Team Sports (w00t) 8th English II  Well I've already finished about the first 6 weeks of Spanish this semester. Haven't got the Algebra 2 book yet, forgot the World History book (*whacks head in masochistic effort to boost memorization*), and Theatre Art doesn't have one. No long-term projects yet. Damn, I wish I didn't need sleep.

      Well, I'm very probably going to be unable to (wow, so many prepositions) post here for quite a while, about a week maybe. School starts tomorrow, and I'm planning to get the syllabus for all of my 8 courses and study all of the material this week, finish all of the homework they give in the first week, as well as all the long-term projects. For the homework and projects they don't give officially in the first week, I'm planning to sweet-talk them into giving me the details in advance (who can resist a young, starry-eyed, ambitious student? hehe, the gullible bastards).  I know, I'm a dork. But I'm a manipulative dork.

      I dream in Black And White Although I am still alive  There is a park bench Painted Black And White In a beautiful park In dark gray sky and In Dark Black trees And here I sit Dressed in Black And White  Death I see is sitting next to me He offers me a living rose A rose that is Black And White Death smiles and laughing, Stands and offers me a hand I take his, and stand I ask if I'm still alive He tells me yes And points to the skies The clouds open up And show me the world In color in rainbow Humans talking and laughing Humans talking and killing And asks Heaven, Hell? I ask What does it all mean? He shrugs and says You tell me.

      Well, yesterday I went out with my family to Six Flags. We saw Spain, Britain, Russia, Lithuania, Mongolia, and the Texas Republic. Then we went back home.  Ha ha, just kidding. We did actually pay to wait in line for an epoch or two.  Then we went back home.  Ha ha, just kidding again ^^. We paid to experience near-death sensations because we, as humans, are sadistic bastards. So we blew about $200 on the five of us: my dad, my mom, me, my sister, and my mom's friend, to experience $200 worth of vomit. It was a digestively satisfying experience, especially after that Lithuanian Dog-on-a-Stick, which they assured us was totally ethnically accurate.  The most satisfying moment was when all of us back to the car to eat lunch (lunch is expensive in the park, about $200 worth). I decided to feed the birds some of our lunch because, frankly, we weren't eating $200 worth. After a while, a large flock of pigeons, sparrows, ravens, and small feathered creatures (such as my sister) were feasting.  **Warning, Serious Bit Ahead**  I fed them bits of bread, chips, and some banana. They mostly avoided the banana, I don't think their stomachs are really adapted to it. They went crazy over the bread and chips, though. It was especially funny watching the sparrows hop over and pick up chips bigger than their heads then run off. They stayed pretty far away, wisely cautious of sadistic bastards who would pay $200 to vomit.  It was incredibly cute when I saw a bird pick up a bit of bread. Then another bird of the same species (I'm not sure which, possibly grackles?) ruffled its wings, opened its mouth and began begging (caw caw caw). The first bird then fed the begging one a piece of bread. I was amazed. It was just sooo, if I may use some Japanese that fits better than English, kawaii.  Eventually the flock grew larger and birds began fighting each other over bits of bread. I mean even specks of bread smaller than a rather small ant. However, none of them came closer than about four feet. There was a lot of food around us that we dropped or threw not far enough. Like potato chips, if you've ever thrown a potato chip, you'll understand. But then, an ancient and largely discolored raven came along and just walked up to me and began eating. This guy was ugly, I mean he makes Igor look like Britney Spears (wow). He, the bird, not Igor, was missing feathers around his neck. The many of the feathers he had were brown and some were missing on his back. On his head, they were tattered. All around he was disheveled and looked like, well, Igor. But unlike all the other birds, he walked right up to me and began eating. He could only eat small pieces, if he tried gobbling down chunks of bread like a pigeon, he'd spat it back out. But he was eating whole pieces of bread by himself (albeit piecemeal) rather than fighting over ant-sized bits.  I immediately felt like this raven. I mean, I don't look like Igor, but for some inexplicable reason I felt happy. I see so many other people succumb to fighting and bickering among themselves over the silliest reasons. I've seen friendships destroyed over a girlfriend or boyfriend. I've seen people not speak to each other for months because they got into an argument over who should be President. I've seen people yell and hit each other because one of them forgot to take out the trash (not me ^^).

      Hey everyone. My name is Patrick and I live in the U.S., or so they tell me. This is my first blog, and, well, it's been fun so far ^^. Hmm, lesee, what else can I blog about...  Seems like most people tend to blog about their lives as if people really do care about the fact that they hate their mom, their cat just puked a hairball in their cereal bowl, and they have a birthmark in the shape of Whistler's Mother on their butt. For some reason I cannot maintain a long-term interest in various people whose butts I, with all due respect, will never see nor wish to see. Therefore I will not bore you with the description of Whistler's Mother on my left buttock.  So, I will talk of other, less private things. So, how about the weather? Yes...erm since I don't know where you live... Well there you have it.
