      Date: May 25, 2004 07:06 AM  Subject: RE: hello  Body: hi! i guess i will have to indulge on exchanging notes with you while i still have the chance. i've been on a month-long-break and it will soon be over in june.   i was nominated and assigned as a grade level coordinator (contract starts in june) and i can already feel the weight of the responsibilities on my shoulders for the next three years. i decided to rent a room in one the houses near miriam, where i teach, so as to concentrate and maybe REALLY start living independently.   i was also away from home (for the first time) when i started teaching at mc in 2000. joel was with me to rescue me from the devastation of living alone. he's a great companion, i could just imagine how he has been taking good care of you. his home and his family became more than my own. it only lasted for a school year. it felt so tiring so after i got used to my job's routine, i went back home. i have to mention this because i know that i will have to express my gratitude to him and his family for the rest of my life. things wouldn't be great if not for their support and unconditional love for me.   my life, starting june this school year, will be different from what i described. i can't think of anyone else to rescue me but myself and God. yeah, i've been strenthening my estranged relationship with Him. and that makes things more exciting for me.   honestly, looking for love has been so frustrating on my part. though i've dated a couple times, been attracted to a number of potential papas, but i only ended up toying with trauma and dwelling on my "know-it-all-been-there" school of thought. i believe that love has to be something that mystifies me, wanting me to jump right into it without second thoughts nor fear. that is why i won't cease to hope and pray for true love. but for as long as the man i am with isn't successful in erasing the trauma, i am simply determined to show true love to myself and everybody else, the Christian way.   i wish to give my some reaction to your letter so please bear with the length of this letter :)   well, here's the other side of the story. edsoc yahoogroups has been my only link with joel. it keeps us updated with the project and stuff. you could've laughed if you found out that even in this group, we both managed to ignore each other's presence. it's a common trait that i share with joel. it wasn't difficult for me because i know a number of his used-to-be-close friends who ended up mutually ignoring each other due to some misgivings. haya, his girlfriend before me, had the same experience. to cut it short, it's the most predictable ending to any of his relationships.   although he didn't intend for us to end that way, i am consistent with this principle: a break up for me means to break every bond that i've shared with the person, no matter how great the love was. it's as worse as acknowledging the person's inexistence. he knows it because i refused his offering of friendship when we broke up. for me, it's the most descent thing to do. especially when i knew about your existence. it's the greatest gift i could offer to his relationship with you.   however, i'm realizing the immature implications of this principle. i don't know if joel was able to share this with you. during the first week of janaury this year, we almost bumped into each other when we crossed the (opposite sides) of the overpass along philcoa. we were both shocked. i could feel his resistance it was so obvious he almost turned back. i didn't find it insulting, rather, i realized it was my funniest experience with an ex-lover, i even laughed secretly. occasions like that are invetible and i can't imagine myself receiving that kind of treatment from him, again. baka matawa ako ng husto mabatukan ko siya nang di-oras. that's joking aside!   going back to our edsoc affair, i was too wary about attending the concert. i was responsible for inviting three of our guest bands for that night and the only way for me to thank them was to witness their performances. the anxiety rooted from my awareness that joel also prepared a performance that night. it would be the first time for us to meet since the break-up and i had the gut feeling that you would be there; this worsened my anxiety. people were used to seeing us together and seeing the three of us in that concert was the MOST awkward moment for me. I even prayed for the presence of my dad, brother and male buddies that night, just to feel secure. I was left with no choice, i took all the courage and it was indeed a very rewarding experience. I finally saw the two of you together. I am just used to friends telling me that they saw joel with her new gf, blah, blah, while i listen and smile. the three of us were there and so were the rest of our the edsocers, but, i have to disagree about the secret hate. :) it was just awkward. i actually felt so relieved after seeing the performances ended well and i was so ready to go home! i didn't bother to wait for joel's performance so as to give the two of you to get to know the rest of the group.   i found out, a few months after, that joel wasn't able to perform. the vp apologized for it in one of her emails. i felt bad about it (i even lost interest in extending my support with our org; nobody should do anything like that with a fellow alumni). knowing joel, i could already guess how he reacted on it, but i hope i was wrong.   with the rest of our common friends in edsoc, (they weren't around during the concert) it took me almost a year before i showed up with the group-- not even with gigi, my closest friend in the group. remember, during our last talk over the phone? you even advised me to meet them. but i wanted them not to see a devastated may, so it really took a long while. it only started when gigi and i accidentally bumped into each other in philcoa, october 2002, (oh yeah, that place for me is really something!) and we had the opportunity to talk to each other. that was also the only time when i was informed about the existence of another edsoc yahoogroup with a selected set of members. joel was among them. during that time, joel made a fuss about the issues on friendship and backbiting through the internet. he's always been anti-backbiting but how he treated the situation that time really pissed off the rest of our friends. it was about whether to let the other members join the group or not (it's EDSOC anyway). it was a very long argument with both sides having a point and nobody wanted to compromise. joel was "dismissed" in the said group and that's how their "anger" toward him started. it's not about our break-up because they didn't want to take sides. but that was also the time when i showed up. the group went out to celebrate celani's bday, and they were supposed to discuss joel's contention. unfortunately, it all narrowed down to my account of what happened between us. that was the time when i was obssessing about satine and my theories of who did what. i must say that it was very therapeutic on my part.   they praised me for keeping things to myself for a long time. that's because, i told them, i wanted joel to have the opportunity to reach out to his friends without my stories because i didn't want to create the bias with how they see things. they didn't judge joel for his decision, i am aware that they respect it. but they just can't help but to show support on my part, until the time i told them what happened. After i shared everything to them, i asked them to wait for joel's side. Reconciliation still has to happen, soon, i hope. Things will get better esp when joel has finally opened his heart and realize how much his friends miss him, too. Maboteng i mean Mahabang usapan un pag nagkataon.   Gigi finds you nice and accommodating but she admitted to me that her loyalty would be best shown by being on my side. Thanks for understanding. By the way, in case joel doesn't know yet, gigi and j are planning to get married in 2006. Yes, they plan to invite both of you, but they have to look at me for approval. ano ba yun, sabi ko parang ang laki ng karapatan kong humadlang sa pagpunta niyo ni joel dun. Anyway, if in case that happens, ikaw na mismo magpilit kay joel, please. JFabs has been his best buddy ever. It's very rare for Joel to keep friends. it's also difficult to win Joel's trust and confidence and I am happy that J has been so loyal with Joel as Gigi is to me.   To be honest, I never gave them the slightest idea to hate any of you. I even told them that satine, for all i know, must be my alter ego, and i must have been losing my mind all this time. (that, including me, made them laugh) it became a running joke every time we had the chance to wonder how joel is doing.   Joel is really a little boy (which reminds me of nanay). Thank you for taking good care of him as well. He deserves everything that you've been giving him. And yes, the weird sense of humor you are talking about is very evident with what we are into right now. This is so far God's weirdest answer to my prayer.   Thanks for the nice movie line. I guess I have to watch the movie to appreciate it even more.   My heart is smiling right now and i want you to know it.   :),  may   P.S.  Grabe na ito. The saga goes on with those pranksters! Di bale, just think of it as an experience that brings you closer to Joel. Marami lang talaga sigurong admirers si Joel. With what you're experiencing, I admire your patience and spunk in dealing with these stuff. I do hope that they would stop bugging you already. Kung sino man yang mga yan, may they rest in peace.

      Date: May 25, 2004 04:10 AM  Subject: hello  Body: I know how the excruciating pain of losing the one you love to someone else can incinerate all your dreams and hopes in life. I had been in a similar situation and somehow I felt your pain (which is odd enough because I’m one of/ if not the lone cause of that pain.) I wanted you to know that…so I…reached out. I emailed you, not out of spite but out of the fact that I am after all that woman on the other side of the ring. Between us two, there exists no villain. We are merely victims of life’s sense of humor. But we must see it through, our fate, what brought us here, the best way we know how. And I coped most cruelly by extending my friendship to you. Been so naïve to assume that of you. I really should have given you more space back then... It was all too soon for you and I should have respected that. =)   Our paths crossed once, during your Edsoc concert. Remember? Was debating with myself if I should pretend that I didn’t see you or ignore you or smile at you. Well, I never had the chance to resolve that variance because you never looked my way. Though, I'm on foreign ground and amongst people who could be nursing a secret hate for me, despite our previous correspondence and your blatant hate for me and regardless of the fact that you were with your support group, I really would have opted to smile. =)   Now, what I would love to see is for Joel and your other orgmates (your friends whom he felt empathized with you during your break-up and judged his actions without even talking to him) reconcile. You know how he can be so unforgiving. The only people he has been keen on seeing are Gigi and JFabs. I want Joel to keep his old friends. How are they anyway? Are they still mad? (Haven’t met most of them and yet I feel as if they all hate me) Gigi, in a way has become distantly cold, but polite, towards me, which was so different to the way she used to respond to me. She's confused (these are all unjustified assumptions…I could be wrong) maybe...she may be thinking that if she gets too “friendly” with me she would, in an obscure way, be betraying your friendship. But I give her that because she's your friend. =)   Joel’s doing okay... he just hates the fact that he can’t accept any Theater/TV acting job. He had to turn down a lot of opportunities/auditions/casting calls because of his work. You’re right about media being his passion…sometimes I think, he’s more of a starlet than I am. =) He’s too stoic to be a brilliant actor but that same quality can turn him into an outstanding “news man”. I try my best to indulge him with whatever he wants.  I’m like his yaya, mother, fashion consultant, stage girlfriend, and critic combined. It’s so funny how he can be so helpless and unassuming sometimes. Not that I enjoy his vulnerability, it just makes me feel needed. He’s like a little boy really…big dreams, big hopes… =)   Fate and love has a weird sense of humor...nakakatawa dahil parehong tayo ang punchline. =)No matter how difficult or impossible the situation seems to be if it’s written in the stars, it will get better. It does feel good to be rid of hate, is it not? =) Btw, I saw your page. I see you’re fond of movie lines. I have been compiling movie lines and dialogues since I was fourteen, one of my many quirks.   “Choices are like connecting highways. They all take you to the same place. Some just take longer to get there.”  ~ Ione Skye, DREAM FOR AN INSOMNIAC   Send you more soon =)   P.S.  I still get the usual pang-haharas; from anonymous texts, crank calls, ims (instant messages), emails, kahit friendster di pinaligtas…had to change my mobile number and my home phone number because of that. Don’t want to go into details anymore as it could start another fire. Inexplicably, I somehow learned to just shrug it off. (I think I failed to respond about this matter in my previous mail)

      Date: May 24, 2004 02:43 AM  Subject: RE: here’s my response to your blog  Body: hello :)   i have always prayed for peace of mind despite the pain. but faith for me lately has been futile. though i know that i have to act on my situation the soonest way possible, i opted not to, yet. i wanted a natural healing and i wanted to be sincere. i consider now as the only time and again, I am thankful for this opportunity.   the reaction i had with your attempt to be friendly with me before was all too clouded with dismay. i didn't want the immediate world around me to be affected with the kind of hell that i was experiencing then. so, i lived and loved life as if it was the most perfect gift prepared for me. i always believed that it was the path that i have to take no matter how many turns or re-routing i've done. i am and will be proud of myself because it sure made me happy and contented.   however, you were the immediate person who became the outlet of pain that's why every single deed be it good or bad, has always made me tick. and yes, even your existence.   well, i also agreed with you about the fondness we had for each other even before i composed the hate mail. shared that with my best friend and neither of us could understand why. the sole reason why i sent u that mail was to give myself enough space to breath and heal. you were so ready for us to be friends* and i was the annoyed person who's counting from one to ten. apparently, i needed more counts than ten :)   *i have to thank you for your effort to be friendly despite and in spite of everything because when my it was my turn to make one really came in easy especially when i realized that i was really ready.   thanks for the update. actually, gigi and j have been updating me with joel's whereabouts every time we go out with the rest of our orgmates. they didn't have to tell me those stories about him but they did it as if it was the most natural thing to do. though they've been working on seeing us as two different entities now,as two of our common friends, they couldn't help it but feel concerned for us. so i know about his being a "news man" in anc . being involved in media has always been joel's inclination, if not his first love/passion. so i am glad he's finally made it. :)   i'm sorry to hear about your health. perhaps your guardian angel also prodded me to finally let you know my long overdue forgiveness. Well, let us thank God for His perfect timing. I will pray for your complete recovery, for joel to be more inspired and strengthened in taking care of you, and to live his dreams for both of you.   illnesses come in many ways so i must admit that your response has also made me feel better.   love,  may

      From:  Margo   Date: May 23, 2004 01:21 PM  Subject: here’s my response to your blog  Body: (Read your blog last week. Finally figured out how to get there and here’s my response)   True, I doubted you but I never hated you (believe me because if I did, I would have made a drastic move a long time ago.) I have been accused of being tactless, insensitive and I plead guilty to all of them. Sometimes, I do say things without much thought of the consequences. It is with much effort now that I keep things to myself; keep things that I know people would not want to hear.   To be honest, I never quite understood your sarcasm, your anger and your hatred. After you sent me your hate mail, I went through the letter I wrote for you …hoping to figure out what made you tick. I wasn’t successful. I distinctly remember you saying that no matter how beautifully I put my words together…its underlying message is clear and simple… I know you’re good at reading between the lines but sometimes it is best to take the words simply for what it meant and stood for. Over analyzing can cloud our judgment of things and often it would lead to misunderstandings. Just as so you’d know, I wrote that with no hidden agenda, no sub-text, and no ploys whatsoever. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not washing my hands clean as well. I know I’ve caused you unbearable pain by just existing. Anyway, tapos na yun. Apology accepted. =) I’m just so relieved to read your message. Thank you. I have said sorry to you too many times…But it wouldn’t kill me to say it again…I truly am sorry for everything.   Haven’t changed my mind about you…Remember when I told you that I like you kahit sa text and email lang? Well, I’m actually pretty positive that if things haven’t been the way they turned out to be, we would have been really good friends. Don’t worry about that smile… Though I have the reputation for being an ice queen…I could always melt for a friend. And oh! No one ever plans on having his/her heart broken… It just happens. Not exactly the most wonderful experience but it’ll come nonetheless.   Good luck…Life really is short so we’ve got to make the most of it. =)    PS:  Joel is working in ANC/ABS CBN as a news writer for almost a year now. He just recently had his first cover job. As for myself, I’m with Knowledge Channel Foundation (I’m their official station id/voice over), and ABS-CBN and Alta Production Group (GMA). I write and dub cartoons/animes/telenovelas/chinovelas. Been sick for a couple of months now (so this letter of yours is very timely…if I do go, I go with a clear conscience and a less burdened soul…not that I intend to die anytime now) I’m in therapy for more than a month. I’m trying to get by everyday… going through the usual motions of life and he has been with me all the way, worrying and crying with me. Sometimes I feel sorry for him. He just has too many plans and dreams for us. It isn’t all that bad really. I hope that God would pull me out of this and make it all better.   margo

      May 7, 2004  You found me! Admit it, you hate me to death. I used to feel the same way. For whatever it's worth, i want you to know that that hate i felt for you before has turned into fondness. Well, here you are, trying to figure out something and here I am trying to prove something.   You were the first one to admit it, you've been into constant obsession about me, your present's past. Well, of the so many opportunities that you've been giving me to be updated with what's new to both of you, I guess i've also been obssessed with my past's present, and who knows, my past's future as well. I rarely have time to obssess about you, but everytime i'm given an opportunity, i've eventually learned to smile at what i am witnessing.   I am pretty good at looking at the brighter side of things. So, let's put it this way, God has His ways of making us closer together. Our hatred-slash-obsession towards each other might, somehow, end here. There are things left unresolved, people (aside from the three of us) have stayed anonymous. I still don't know how to deal with them, but, I do know how to deal about us. I might forgive those people if they have been brave enough to reveal themselves. I hope you will too.   I am not washing my hands from anything. I know that I've caused pain to both of you. It's because, I, too, was handling too much pain. But I know that either will not last for eternity (might last for a lifetime, but, at least, not for eternity, right?). With this thought, I am asking for your forgiveness. I learned to forgive myself and the two of you. Since learning to forgive is the most simple step towards total healing.   After almost two years, I read the content of this blog. It was a relief that nothing in its content has served as a remnant of any ill-wishes. Rather, I saw a person who's handling pain in the most apt manner. I've always been this way believe me.   He once thanked me for understanding his situation. All I could tell him then was I wanted him to be happy. Now, I can honestly say that I am happy for both of you. I am happy that he found you. I am happy because he's found his happiness with you.   It's easier to be happy with him if we both know that we've found a way to share each other's peace. Through this, we can both continue to live a life without hating someone.   This letter, I hope, will serve as our first attempt to bond and respect each other's world. If in case God wants us to meet someday, we don't have to talk things out (because i am not good at expressing serious thoughts verbally, i stutter, i cry or i hide it through laughter; i hate confrontations as well; but, i am good at warm and friendly gestures). If in case our paths crossed, we can at least smile at each other and say hi.   I am out of words already. But let me conclude this with the point that I am trying to make, there is no competition between us, and nobody should be left as a victim (i am particularly talking loudly to myself). Just for the record, I never planned for this thing to happen. However, I hope that you could still remember the last letter i sent u. This is what concludes it. God has lead us to be into this situation. I am writing to you and you will soon read this.   Have a great life ahead of you!

I'll be brutally honest with you. I loved talking to you but reminding myself of that lost love just gives me no reason to move on. But I am over it already.   Just like you, I just can't seem to understand why some people have to be so concerned about it when both Joel and I are completely done with it.    The efforts that you're having now are simple signs of insecurity. I also think that you are a very selfish woman because I know that you're doing just to have your own peace of mind....   I am also aware of the reason why you are trying to talk things out.  You wanted to fish some information which Joel couldn't provide you.  If he did, his words would not satisfy you unless you hear them from me.  The reason why I have decided to keep quiet was because I wanted you to discover it for yourself... to know Joel on your own. I even told you na hindi na ako makikialam sa last e-mail ko sa'yo.  Try to recall. Bakit ngayon mo lang na-realize yun? There are things that should be left unsaid because they are all pretty obvious. Such is this one. Sarili mo lang ang iniisip mo.    Only Joel and I know the reason why we are apart now. You may be his present and his future but you are not part of our past.  So let it be! I don't know where you gather your strength from talking with me about you and him and me and him. Parang sanay na sanay ka. To tell you my dear, third party din ang rason ng break up ko with my first bf.  Madali lang talagang makalimot pag third party na usapan. So this isn't new to me as well and I know how to handle it pretty well. Unlike you, I don't have the guts to talk to that other party.  Buhay na nila yun e. I have my life as well. No matter how painful it is, Joel also had his past girlfriends before I came into his life. There was this person whom he became intimate with and was a special friend of mine.  I trusted Joel's words and his stories of her were all that I have.Try to respect me as Joel's past as I did to his past girfriend.   My principle behind realtionships is plain and simple, give it your best shot so that there won't be any regrets.  Pray for direction. If it didn't work (naniniwala ako sa divine intervention) then no regrets!   We may be talking about one and the same man but we are talking about two different time and space.  You don't have to comfort me with those kind words because you are irritating me even more. It doesn't sound so sincere. I'm sorry pero feeling ko dalang-dala yun ng pagiging magaling mong artista. You are not even my friend.    We are not in a competition. I can, however, sense the competition by the way we communicate.  I may not be feeling well everytime I'm reminded of what happened but I DID NOTHING TO HARM ANY OF YOU AND THAT'S THE SWEETEST REVENGE THAT I CAN HAVE. Revenge pa rin yun however we put it, di ba? We confessed that we have our own share of nightmares. You and Joel may be my worst nightmares but that used to happen MONTHS AGO.  I'm afraid I'll be having them once again. Dreams are part of our subconscious. I'll be thinking about your stories about him, your picture together, and the reason why he chose you over me.  Pain is self-chosen.  I guess we both chose pain by exchanging notes about a common lover. Gaga tayo pareho. Period.   I'm not even sure if the people who are bugging you are my friends or they just happen to know Joel's past or background.  I am aware that Joel has a lot of admirers even when we were in college. Feeling ko hindi lang ikaw ang gusto nilang sirain.  Pati ako sinisira nila.  They'll do anything para magalit sakin si Joel.   But it's not important to me anymore.  Mas maganda nga yun, it's easier to think that the man who has caused me loads of pain after our break-up now hates me instead of wishing that somehow, he felt sorry for me and that somehow he misses me.  We can't undo the things that had been done.  All of the turn of events are really going mad. Alam kong marami pang gagawing kataranduhan yung mga taong yun just to destroy either of us. Natawa na lang ako when I last saw satine's msg, parang mas pinagtanggol ka pa niya.  She used to be my friend di ba? Nakakairita kasi, the more I was tempted to get back at them. Meron kang anonymous text messages.  Now, someone has been trying to access Joel's e-mail.  Now there's Catherine.  So, who's next? what's next? A plot for us to meet? Mag-away? Mag-isnaban? Magsampalan? We've been handling things like educated people but i have to keep on saying this, I am expecting the unexpected.      I was so surprised when you asked me if we could talk over the phone. I didn't have to but I remembered the time when I was so harrassed by what that satine did.  You did not hesitate to talk to me that time and it helped me clarify things out. I entertained your call last week just to get even with your coolness.  Tama yung hinala ko, there's something wrong. I'm expecting the worse already.  Kapag ang message ay galing sa inyo ni Joel, trouble ang katapat. That was also the reason why I blocked ur addresses together with satine and joel.  Ayoko na ng gulo.  Things were getting worse already.May mga tao talagang ayaw ng katahimikan.     But I was wondering... when it was satine who's been sending us this message thing, parang wala lang sa'yo when in fact, as I could recall, mas malala yung mga sinabi niya about you.  You read Catherine's message to me over the phone and there was nothing wrong with it. And there you were, so eager to know if it was me who did it.  Why didn't you keep your cool towards Catherine's message to you? Di ba nga dapat mas secured ka na... It's been 8 mos., ikaw na nagsabi. You and Joel are planning to get married.  So, what's the purpose of this letter? of this picture? of your phone call?   I told you that I have blocked your  e-mail and here you are again, gumawa ka pa ng bagong e-mail mo just to make sure that I will receive your messages.  You even used all of my e-mail ad.  BTW, I'm not using teacher_crismay to send personal e-mail ads (only to store my lesson plans) so how did u know it? I'm just wondering.   I am reading between the lines in your letter.  Hindi ko rin alam kung bakit kailangan mong ipagdukdukan ang relationship nyo ni Joel sa akin by sending me your picture with him.  Have I seen it? Paano? How would you feel if you see my pictures with Joel? I'm actually planning to send everything to you... sunugin mo pa kung gusto mo.    Never in my life have I imagined myself being involved in this thing.  Kababawan. I'd rather die in pain silently and continue living. I'm sorry pero nachi-cheapan nako sa mga nangyayari.  Parang soap opera. Parang part ng script ng isa sa mga stage play. I am aware of the drama's of life pero hindi ko pinipilit yung sarili ko para magmukhang bida na kinaaawaan.    No matter how we convince ourselves that Joel is yours and that you're both happy and I'm his past, words are just not enough to explain or rationalize things.  We can't rationalize the realities of life... we just have to accept it.  Unless we do, we'll just keep on quenching our thirst for explanation and convince ourselves that we are truly satisfied on how things went on.   One piece of advice, if you are going to spend forever with someone, you have to be ready with the consequences.  I remember Joel's words, before, our predisposition towards a relationship will always be the same no matter how we try to change ourselves. Joel and I are living proofs to that.   Marami ka pang pagdadaanan (hindi lang ito).  Marami pang taong makikialam.   On the other hand, don't try to use other people just to have him. Ikaw na ang nagsabi, lahat gagawin mo just to own his entire being.  I don't know how far you can go with this sutff.  It's your words against mine.  I'm telling you all of these because no matter how beautifully you wrote your letter to me, it's underlying message is clear and simple.  Kung balak kong manggulo, expect the worse. And my goodness, you really expected the worst! I realized na yung taong iniimagine mong sasaksak sa'yo e ako.  Ni hindi man lang sumagi sa ulo ko.   O nga pala, you love drama kaya ikaw na mismo ang gumagawa ng drama ninyo ni Joel (para mag-away?) kung minsan.  Is this part of your drama Margo?   Stop trying to act like you're a nice person to me because I think you are  not.  Because if you are, matagal mo na akong pinatahimik. You're insensitivity says it all. I told you that I don't have both of your numbers and e-mail ads. Hindi mo na nirespeto yun. You are good at giving advice to other people.  I guess it's just but proper to give yourself a sound advice about how you handle things right now.    Since you made such a great effort to send this message to me, I'll also make sure that mine will reach you as well.  I don't know how far this can get but what you did really disappointed me. Sobra na.  Forgive me for my sarcasm. I know I'll be sorry for what I wrote here one day. Iba lang talaga ako pag napupuno.  Sabi ko sa'yo mas gusto ko ng action kesa drama pag-nagagalit.   I know that you are still trying to prove something.  Kung ano man yun, I don't give a damn anymore.    Above all these angst that I have written in this letter, just like you, I also wish you your happiness. If you think that your happiness really depends on your relationship with Joel, so be it.  We all hope to end up with a prince charming anyway. I plan to pray for you as well but I'll make sure that my prayers for you will be sincere and honest. Mahirap magsinungaling kay Lord.  I can't do that now because what you just did really annoyed me.  Baka maisumpa lang kita ng di-oras. Alam kong prangka kang tao kaya masisikmura mo itong hate mail ko sa'yo    I just think that you have the right to know these. Perhaps, with this letter, we'll both realize that we are really bound to hate each other in this lifetime. I still wish you good luck no matter what.   form Margo:  Hi MAY! we had a good talk last week...actually...it was a terrible but a  good mistake (pretty ironic huh?) in a way I think we both needed that. And  I love talking to you as well. I am so sorry that i have been so  inconsiderate and insensitive to your feelings. You told me a lot of things  about the past you and Joel shared and I shared with you our present. After  that conversation I haven't been able to focus much on my work...I was at a  taping in Batangas for a soap opera and the things you said just kept on  popping inside my head. Just like you, I have nightmares of you and Joel  getting back together just as you have nightmares of seeing us happy. But  then I wake up and he's there beside me...holding on to me. You were right  the first time when you told me that it( communication we are having)  wouldn't help any of us. There are things about Joel that I would like to  discover for myself...You knew him well and I would love to get to know him  on my own... it has been eight months already...I am terribly sorry that you  are in pain and that we are happy. I know exactly how you are feeling...been  through the same lot my dear. In your own time and pace and with God's grace  you'll feel better. It is not easy being dumped for another woman. (And  never in life have I dreamed of being that other woman.) You will not  understand it and you'll refuse to accept it.Why her? she's nothing...she  doesn't even know you...you don't even know her! the evil side of you will  always want blood and revenge! you would eventually try to murder me...  you'll say to yourself that they can't and wont be happy because I am not!  You'll feel this tingling sensation in your bones and your heart would want  to escape your chest everytime you will hear my or his name. Just thinking  about it would make you want to barf. But you see, you are his past and I  am his present and his future...I love this man more than anything...and I  know you love him as well...It just so happens that he loves me back.  We both didn't answer each other when we both asked what am I too you...or  was it how do you feel about me? To be honest... at first, I was afraid of  you...of the things you could do to us... I wished you weren't so  irritatingly perfect and disgustingly undersatnding. I wished he didn't  loved you at all. But you are irritatingly perfect and disgustingly  understanding and he loved you. I said to myself the first time I sent you  an email..."You are one hell of a sick bitch!" (i'm refering to myself here)  But I did it anyway...I wanted to get to know you to lessen my doubts and  fears and my guilt. At first it was simply because I wanted to find out if  he made the right decision...if I was better than you. Well you know what i  am not better than you and you are not better than me either. We are just  two different woman who happens to love the same man. i hated Joel when he  told me that he told you that we sort of look a like...(not in a bad way, i  just hate to be compared and I am not comfortable unless I am distinct). I  am obsessed about you. Just as those loser friends ( sorry!) of yours are  obsessed about me. For us to really move on... we should forgive each other  and stop hurting each other anymore.it is not easy to let go but we are left  with no other options but to do so.the past is not for living in (actually  that line is more for me) i want peace in our relationship and I know you  want it in your life as well. Things happen for a reason...I haven't been  really happy before Joel came...I am happy but superficial happy... being  able to do something that I am so passionate about, meeting new and  interesting people, making all that money, going out evry night (who cares  if it's school night!)...I mean I have a full but empty life (if you know  what I'm talking about) Maybe I just need him more than you do and maybe I  am the one he needs as well. He brought direction to my life...and I brought  direction to his. He taught me that life is not one big glamourous show...  Remember when we both found out that he gave us the same bracelet for  christmas...it nearly blew my head off. I wanted to wring his neck because  that bracelet meant a lot to me...but you see it doesn't make it less  special because he gave the same thing to you... I know that now. I wish you  all the happiness in this world and I sincerely hope that you'll find the  one for you. Or maybe he'll find you? Take care my friend.  sometimes there is no plan... we may have all that anecdotes and creeds to  live by but all we really have to do is breathe everyday and see what  happens...   always, margo  * i will be silently praying for your happiness. Don't worry I will take  care of him and his family. I don't know if you have seen this but I also  attached our fave pic together...
