      I am a walking, talking tree. Hear me grunt.    Entish    urlLink   To which race of Middle Earth do you belong?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     And my soul is made of vodka. Sort of... But I cheated on this one.    You come from Heaven.  You're the purest of pure, a saint.  You're probably an angel sent directly from Heaven.    urlLink   Where Did Your Soul Originate?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    So, I am a giant, living piece of wood. A tree from heaven. Firewood from heaven. God sent you, er, firewood, through me, with built in audio instruction. But then I burn and die, just like Jesus. No wait, he was crucified, but close enough.  Being a tree really sucks, heaven sent or not.

      This movie was recommended to me by my friend Nick. It stars George "Bushy Boy" Bush and John "Annoyingly Corpse-like" Kerry.  Both of them sing. It is very funny.  http://atomfilms.shockwave.com/contentPlay/shockwave.jsp?id=this_land_af&track=0  It has been receiving a lot of publicity lately, so you (whoever "you" are) might have already heard of it or seen it. If so, I don't give a shit. The link is there for the ignorant among us, so bite my ass if you don't like it.  Oh, wow, I actually just WROTE something. I hate writing. Writing sucks. Damn, what has become of me?  *sticks head in toilet while deep in thought*
