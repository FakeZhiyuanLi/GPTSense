      Well, it's safe enough to date online if you select ID's and nick names that aren't going to allow a stalker or jilted e-date to hunt you down.   Not only that, but at anytime you can "block" users and never have to give out your name or e-mail address if things aren't going well with your initial online contact.  But what happens when you're ready to go from cyber-date to phone calls, on to a face-to-face meeting?  I have some guidelines...don't know if they're really valid or not, but by following them I at least feel better.  E-MAIL: I only give out the e-mail account I set up specifically for the online dating adventure I'm on. It was free with Yahoo, and I have a separate account for business, and for family.  PHONE NUMBERS:  I only give out my cell phone...it has caller ID and I can easily change that number since my good friends and family know my home number.  MEETING FACE-TO-FACE: Well, this gets tricky.  I tell each suitor that I need his first and last name and one or more phone numbers.  I then forward these on to my mom and my sister.  I tell my mom and sis when and where the meeting is, and give them the suitor's information. I also let the suitor know that my family knows where I'm at and with whom.  Good news is, no one minds this approach (unless they're giving me fake names, which could happen in a bar or where ever too.)  LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION: For guys that live out of town...I'm pretty tough. You want to see me bad enough, you must come to my town (at first at least).  Then we'll see how it goes. You see, I have my network of friends and family here, so that if something goes wrong..I send out the bat signal.  I also pick a very public place, a place I am familiar with. I want home turf so to speak. Even a place where I know the employees so they can verify I was there. (man, am I over thinking this or do I watch too much CSI and Law & Order?)  TRANSPORTATION:  Always drive your own vehicle the first couple of times.   Since I'm fairly new at this, I haven't gotten to a second or third date situation yet, so I have no rules as far as when to begin trusting the suitor. I depends on the dates and the guys I guess. We'll see. I may have to add rules as I go along and as new experiences pop up.

      I have been chatting with Mark from a nearby town. He is in the insurance business...the sales side of it. We have a similar approach to this experience and we tend to share the ups and downs of it.  He made a joke about referring to his On-line Dating handbook and actually provided some rules. I want to share his comments because they're funny and yet pathetic in the fact they are written from true experiences.   Rule 13 - Cropping a pic to show just your eyes isn't fooling anyone.  We know you're hiding something.  Rule 14 - If you have a child and you write that they are "your world" or that "they mean the world to you"...then you are being silly.  Most people pretty much assume that you actually LOVE your kids.  Be wary of anyone who says, "I'm a parent, but...you know, they really don't mean THAT much to me..."  Rule 20 - You cannot pose yourself seductively and half naked on a bed for your photo and then mention "family values" anywhere in your ad.   Rule 21 - When describing the things you are desire in a suitor you cannot list 20 qualities and in the very next section describe yourself as "low maintenance."  If you do this, go directly to jail..do not pass GO, do not collect $200.  Rule 33 - You cannot post a picture more than 2 years or 20 pounds old.     Rule 38 - You cannot say that you are intelligent and then use the word "intellegent."  Rule 94 - You cannot say you like long walks on beaches...when you live in Illinois.  While we were only joking about a handbook, it sure would be nice to have a little guidance regarding expected behavior.

      I replied to a guy who sent me an online "ice-breaker"...because after I read his profile, he sounded nice and he was a decent, average-hansome man. Online, you don't use real names unless you choose to.  So after a couple e-mails, he signs his note with his real name: FLOYD.  I hated to be this way, but this is how I had to let him down gently, and below that is his response, priceles... THE BIG LET DOWN: Hi Floyd, Sorry it's been a while since I last wrote. I have been busy getting through all of the responses...It is actually overwhelming me, but I don't say that to brag as I'm not about that. I just am trying to evaluate each response and determine which ones to carry forward.   So, having said that...I have a very bizarre reason for not moving too quickly in your direction and you're probably going to think I'm a straight up NUT...  but, it's your name...it connotates something for me totally opposite of "potential romance".  You see, my male idol growing up was my Uncle Floyd...I didn't have a dad, and he helped to raise me and look after me. So I have more of a family feeling when I hear that name.  Not to mention, a set of standards that really any man may have a hard time filling...let alone a guy with the same name.  The other weird part is it rhymes with my ex-husband's name Lloyd....I know, it sounds shallow and made up, but it's not.  With so many people to get through, I have to go with gut instinct...and my gut says to wish you luck in your pursuit of happiness and with rebuilding your life. Thanks for your understanding... take care.   FLOYD's RESPONSE: Well, that does seem strange but I do respect you being honest and responding. Thank you for that and good luck to you. Floyd PS I have a brother named Lloyd also  LOL  Like the blog says...Life is stranger than fiction..you can't make this crap up.

      The first date I actually went on with a guy from the online personals was a spur of the moment deal. but since I'm hoping to have several Dating Dossier's to provide you. Let's try this easy format: BACKGROUND: Ted had sent me a brief and polite introductory message on personals. and then after a couple chats, I gave him my regular e-mail address.   After it seemed we hit if off, and I was certain he was gainfully employed and no red flags popping up in e-mails, I gave him my cell phone number a couple days before he called.   Well he called at 5:00 and said, "Hi, this is Ted. We've been speaking on line for about a week. I'm a spontaneous kind of guy, and was hoping to take you to dinner tonight."  Cool, a nice surprise...he had a nice voice, so I accepted and met him an hour later.  LOCATION & ACTIVITES: TGI Friday's for dinner. Putt-putt golf and a night cap at neighborhood watering hole of mine.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Drives a nice car (Jeep grand cherokee 2004) Walks with confidence, but not arrogance. Balding. Glasses.  Not too tall, but not short either. Muscular, but not a "meat head" either. Reminds me a little of Doug, a son-in-law of my mom's fiance.  HIS HISTORY: divorced four years ago. no kids. Spent 8 years in the Army (infantry). Married during a trip to Vegas, in a chapel..spontaneously. Trying to finish his bachelor's degree while working full time as a safety superintendent. Says the army made him a "goals oriented person, and someone who is comfortable with routine, but trying to live life more."  PICKS & TICKS: He has a great sense of humor (pick), but I sensed that when he mentioned being a bit of a prankster that he could be one of those guys who could carry it too far(tick). You know the ones...they do something they think is freakn' hilarious, and you're standing there pissed at what they did.  FUNNY & FREAKY: On our way out to the cars, he missed a step down and fell, HARD. Bounced of the bumper of my car (a bit funny) and twisted his ankle. That's not funny, but freaky..I felt bad for him. He was o.k. to drive home, which for him was an hour. I waited for about a half hour then called to make sure he was almost home.   FOLLOW-UP:  he called me the next morning while I was blowing my hair dry. Didn't hear the phone, but chose not to return his call. Then that same afternoon he e-mailed me. Asked me to go with him to his parents summer home to boat the next weekend. A little forward and timing seemed rushed for something like that. Also has been calling me daily and e-mailing me daily. (a little much too soon? what do you think?)  SUMMARY: While no initial ZING or SPARK, I really had a nice time. Worth a second date to dig a little deeper.

      I just spent a good half-hour or more recapping my newest dating status to my sister and mother in an e-mail. There has to be a better way to keep them and my friends informed.   This whole adventure began two weeks ago when, on a whim, I put a profile out online at yahoo's personals. It's free (to post a profile anyway).   I was breaking it off with the latest boyfriend of a year when I put the profile out there(o.k., technically I broke up with him four days later, we'll discuss my unscrupulous behavior off-line).  I just didn't want to make the same mistake of sitting around wondering why I wasn't meeting people. I was going to be pro-active!   To my big surprise, I got an overwhelming response to my profile. But, the catch is-- to respond to these guys that are virtually knocking your internet door down, you have to sign up for the service. It's minimal, so I gave over my credit card information and away I went into the online dating realm!  "Oh, be careful honey," mom warned. "I hear some real freaks are on that internet dating thing, trying to take advantage of women, especially of women like you."   I had to explain to her the difference between an organized "personals program" and just picking up a guy in a chat room. It's almost as uncomfortable as the "Birds and the Bees" talk she had with me years ago.  We'll get into some of the perils of online dating in an entry to be written later. but for now this is just background on why I have a dating diary.  Well, once I got mom and sis on board with the program, we agreed to my safety precautions (also an entry to be written later). One agreement was to keep a running status of names and general information of the guys on my "short list" that I e-mail or instant message, and especially those I go on dates with.   After my first date, I began to write in a new diary about the guy, the date, my impressions and anything relevant that would keep my mind uncluttered. So, now getting back to the half hour I spent writing an e-mail to mom and sis...I noticed it was almost identical to what I wrote in my diary. I can't spend more than an hour re-living every date in prose.  I will now give them a link to my Dating Diary blog, where I only have to enter it once, and they can post comments on each entry. As can my friends and anyone else who wishes to weigh in on my dating decisions, impressions or my otherwise misguided attempts to find Mr. Right.   If it takes a village to raise child, it'll take a country to get her married off. This is a reader participation blog. Comment, comment often and comment in an honest way.

      Well, dear dating diary, it's been several weeks since my last entry.  I've been dumped. Yep, by Ben, the only hot lead I had to a promising dating relationship. He decided to go back to his girlfriend.  My sources tell me that I should have been no competition, as she was, direct quote: "Psycho, and unpredictable." This came from a reliable source that used to work with her.  I guess it seems all the nice guys tend to gravitate to women who are a bit unstable, bitchy, and demanding. What's up with that?  I mentioned this to my council of "Guy Pals" and they reminded me that nice girls usually find the most unappreciative bad boys. So why is it the relationship universe lines itself up like that? What a cosmic, karmic joke, eh? No wonder the divorce rate is so high!  He tried the "I still want to know you as a friend because you're a really terrific person--" line of crap.  I said no, all or nothing buddy.  He said it had nothing to do with me, and that I had all of the qualities he was looking for. Obviously I couldn't compete with their history, and her knowing all of his emotional buttons to push.  It only took a couple e-mails and one phone call from her over about two days for him to decide to go back.  (At least that's what he alluded to, they could have been in touch all along!)  He said she e-mailed him out of the blue...no way. We women know that she probably caught wind of him getting into a serious dating routine with a girl...and she couldn't stand it. So, his dumping me was her little ego boost I'm sure. I truly hope he doesn't get hurt and that she is really sincere about trying again.  I was upset for about oh, a minute...(no, not really...a little longer), but on day two after the breakup (which was over the phone, how tacky)...I am getting my profile back out there online, and jumping back in with a vengence!   However, not without lessons learned: 1. Guys on the rebound are a huge risk and not ready for serious dating.  2. Guys with low self esteem need not apply to my profile. I need someone with confidence...now there is line between confidence and cockiness, so be aware of when it get's crossed.  3. Everyone is always saying I deserve better. Where in the hell is "Better" and does he go by another name?  So, at the advice of my "guy council" and my esteemed family support system, I am going to get right back out there. Hope to have more entries now that my side-line into a serious dating relationship blew up.  Oh, well, at least now I can say I've been dumped. Yes, it was my first time.   Does it get easier? Probably not, but now I am closer to understanding how the guys I dumped must have felt.  So, I've really been there and done that.

      Just when I had resolved myself to the fact that my online dating experience is going to be an excercise of meeting men who just aren't 100% what I'm looking for...along comes Ben.  BACKGROUND: Ben sent me an icebreaker and we started e-mailing back and forth for a little over a week. From his picture and his e-mails and for some unexplained reason, I had a great feeling about him.  A sense of hope and optimism. I was terribly excited to meet him.   LOCATION & ACTIVITIES: We met at a quiet pub before going out to hear a band that a friend of mine is in. The two hours there flew by...and before we knew it, it was time to go the club where the band was playing.  After listening to the band and talking some more, we were in the mood to dance so we went to another club for house music and a bit of dancing.  After that, we were starving...so off to Steak N'Shake for a 12:30 a.m. cheeseburger. The night just flew by.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS: He got out of his car immediately after I pulled into the parking lot. He recognized me right away...(the benefits of always posting a current photo on your profile).  He was more sexy in person than in his photo, so immediately there was an attraction. He's tall, dark and handsome. Eyes that you can get lost in, so kind and empathetic. Trendy haircut and a kind, unassuming way about him.  HIS HISTORY: He had a girlfriend move out four months ago and is just now getting back into the dating scene. He has an 8 year-old daughter and is on friendly terms with her monther (not the girlfriend that just moved out). Never married, has a good job at the same place as I do. Owns a home in a nearby town, about 30 minutes away.  PICKS & TICKS: He is such fun to be around...not a rambunctious or gregarious kind of fun. Instead he's a laid back, quiet humor kind of guy. (PICK) He has the sexiest voice...melt ya like butter. He's a good dad (PICK).   His choice of clothing for the evening wasn't too great...not awful, just sort of frumpy, but you know us girls, we can change that. (TICK for now)  He dislikes mexican food, chinese food, sea food as well as green peppers, mushrooms, and sometimes onions. He says he was raised on the basics...so that's where his tastes lie, pretty basic. Meals could be an issue...but maybe I can introduce him to stuff he might like. (TICK but manageable) Oh, he and my sis share the same dislike for preparing chicken themselves.  He said there is just something about having to handle the slimy pieces that just ruins the meal once it's prepared.  FUNNY & FREAKY: Our backgrounds are similar...both of our fathers left when we were young...and both of our father's ended up in Reno, NV. (We confirmed that they weren't the same guy...eeeeww...) (FREAKY).  He read my palm.  He studied up on the art of palm reading and tarrot cards as a hobby. It was sexy the way he took my hand and ran his fingers along the lines of my palm, noting what each meant. That my friends is the slickest way to get to hold a woman's hand and to touch her in a very sensuous way without it being too aggressive. (This is in the FUNNY category to me, as I have always been intriuged by these types of things...some may think it is freaky.)  SUMMARY: Out of all of my dates...this one was the best, to be honest...the most perfect balance of similar interests and physical chemistry. The most perfect good night kiss (romantic and gentle) and hug before he left. I have to admit, I probably would have let more happen, but he's the perfect gentleman...he says he really likes me and doesn't want to mess it up. So we parted at about 1:45 a.m.  FOLLOWUP:  I woke up this morning with the cutest e-mail waiting for me from him. and we're working on getting together again soon. I have to admit, I'm smitten, totally. My sis is right, it's going to be hard to decide whether or not to stop dating and stick with one guy for awhile...so far, this would be the guy that would stop the the online dating escapade.

      We interrupt the regularly scheduled dating dossiers to do a quick summary of my experiences so far, and to provide a bit of follow-up. I'm getting ready to meet suitor number 6 for a face-to-face date, so there will be another dossier coming soon.  I'm listing these dates by the titles of their dossiers or entries in this blog so you can go and look them up again for a refresher if you'd like. (some have been booted to the June Archives due to the activity of my entries)  TERRI AND TED'S FIRST BIG ADVENTURE: Well, this turned out to be our only adventure. He called a couple times and I think I must have sounded disinterested, because he hasn't called back. (going on a week now.)  LETTING FLOYD DOWN EASY: While we never met for a date, I must note that this guy kept e-mailing me so I put a block on his ass....he can send notes, but I never get them... and he gets a response from the Yahoo folks saying I've found Mr. Right and am no longer accepting notes.  TMI - BACK OFF TIGER: One email from him and I immediately blocked is butt...no notes from him any more, I simply couldn't block out the hour it took to read the damn things.  THE KISS OF DAN: We have plans to meet again.  We still Instant Message, and I told him a little more finesse in the physical intimacy area would go along way with me. He seemed cool with that because he said he still wanted to get together for dinner. Next week we set something up when he gets back from Chicago.  BASIC BILL DATE: I e-mailed him to thank him for lunch. He e-mailed back and said it was nice and we should get together again sometime..very non-commital and up in the air... I think the ball is back in my court, but I plan to let it bounce on by. (he's too short!, dammit)  MARKY MARK: Ah, Top Notch contender here folks...already set up a date for a movie on Sunday after our dinner date Wednesday. He has actually read and practices the tips from the book Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus... (well, we joke about it alot, but he did read it) We e-mail daily.  JOHN,JOHN, JOHN: Still too exhausted from all of the listening I had to do on this date. I actually slept 11 hours that night...(last night). Too much about him, not anything about me. He needs to read the Men are from Mars book.   I'm sure the lull in this activity will hit soon. Since my profile has been out there, I've heard from 75 different men in three weeks. I've only responded maybe to 10...and keep in touch with them. So the madness continues for awhile, dear readers.  Thanks for hanging in there.

      O.K. say the title to this entry like the line from The Brady Bunch:  "Marcia, Marcia, Marcia" Get the idea?  Maybe I'm tired, and maybe I need a date break as this week was full, but I just had a date I wished had ended two hours before it did.  BACKGROUND: I actually responded to his profile (I've only done that for three guys, with Dan the man being one of the others, his dating dossier is The KISS of Dan). We began e-mailing and phoning. and he finally asked me out. He drove into town to meet me.  LOCATION & ACTIVITIES: We met at a local Mexican Restaurant, Delgados-- for dinner and talked.   FIRST IMPRESSIONS:  He was shorter than I expected, and bit more on the chunky side too...the deepest, prettiest blue eyes...but by the end of the night, not even those could keep me from yawning. My tongue is bloody and bruised from biting it to keep from yawning.  HIS HISTORY: Never married, no kids. Recently laid off from an information systems technology job, and is now installing satellite dishes as his own business, contracting himself out to Dishnet, SBC, Direct TV, etc... moved into a house last year and he loves the pool in the back. He is the youngest child and for all intents and purposes, was basically an only child since his brother is 15 years older than him.  This may explain a lot.  PICKS & TICKS: For a guy, he talks an awful lot...I think we've had maybe a total of three phone conversations, but during our date I heard at least 4 stories/situations that he'd already discussed on the phone. Don't get me wrong, I don't need to be entertained or enthralled by every discussion topic...just pick some new ones... or hey, how about asking me a freak'n question or two. You know, you could tell by the look on his face that while you were getting your measly sentence in...he was busy formulating the next thing he was going to say. Thus, not hearing you at all...do you know those types? (TICK)  FUNNY & FREAKY:  It's funny that he admitted to taking a Feng Shui class, and cooking classes. He says now that he's out of school, that it's fun to take workshops where you're not graded.  FREAKY - he had on a silver pinky ring that the band was a dragon and the dragon's claws were holding a black onyx looking gem.  (a bit on the dark side.) Also funny, but not really, he's allergic to cats, tomatoes and milk.   He has a camera phone...and proceeded to show me pictures of his dog, some exotic looking girl that's a "friend" of his wearing his cowboy hat, and a picture of his hair-dresser.   FOLLOW-UP: He kept going on about this job interview he went on today and how he needed to get a steady job, but yet now that he doesn't work for "the man" (his words), he would really like to stay self employed. He kept going on about how he doesn't take his cholesterol medicine because it costs too much, and how glad he was that it rained today so he won't have to put water into his pool...how he makes ends meet by selling discarded satellite parts on Ebay...I almost felt bad that he paid for dinner, then I got over it.  SUMMARY: A nice hug good night, as he asked for one..Hey, he did pay for dinner on his stretched budget. and he put the ball back in my court to call him if I wanted to get together again. He said he'd like to go out with me again.  I don't know if my ears can take another night with John..."JUST JOHN" (say that last part like Jack, from Will & Grace..you know..."Just Jack!")

      This is the fourth date I've been on since I started my online dating experience.  To recap: Ted, Dan, Bill, and now Mark. BACKGROUND: Mark sent me an icebreaker, and when I read his profile I couldn't stop laughing...it was original and funny. Showed creativity and the ability to laugh at himself. We began and e-mail exchange that actually sparked me to start this whole weblog. (see the entry of One Man's Rules for Online Dating)  His notes included tidbits about family and himself and while they were humorous; they're also very insightful to what he is about.  LOCATION & ACTIVITIES:  We agreed on the phone that a Wednesday evening at 7:00 date would work for both of us, and he promised to get back to me with details. Sure enough he was a gentleman and called back to say he made us reservations for Jim's Steakhouse. Upscale place that's well-known here in town. I was impressed with his arrangements.  We only ate dinner, as it was leisurely and we talked about everything under the sun... pretty much picked up where we left-off from our online conversations. This puts him near the top of the list as this is a criteria I mention under "Creating False Intimacy".  FIRST IMPRESSIONS: He's a true gentleman. I felt totally at ease with him. He is an intense listener and asks really thought provoking questions. (He was a philosophy major.) Stood up and approached me immediately when I walked into the bar area to meet him. Made sure I had a drink (non-alcoholic as I'm on medicine).  A bit more "stocky" in stature...not so much a short stocky..or a nice word for fat...but bordering on potentially "thick" as in muscle thick...the shirt and clothes were baggy so I couldn't tell.   HIS HISTORY: Never married...no kids, and close to his family, but not in a clingy way. Has lived in Madison Wisconsin, and in Minneapolis, MN as the district manager for Blockbuster Video. He now works for an insurance company in which his father is an established agent. Once his father retires, he'll take over the business. He has come close to marriage once, and had another relationship last a year. Wants family, likes kids (he has nephews) and has been busy getting comfortable with who he is, as he explains it.  FUNNY & FREAKY: I mentioned to him that some of my favorite movies are the old James Bond flicks (Sean Connery). His eyes got wide and he said, "My parents met on a blind date to a James Bond movie." (freaky) Mark not only has a great sense of humor but is a movie buff, no, bordering on seen every movie made. But he's not about just sitting around watching movies...he actually has a list of 50 things he wants to do before he dies (on a spreadsheet). There are about 43 left to go...and he has to do one every year on his birthday...at the very least. A couple he mentioned...see the pyramids in Egypt, the Eiffel Tower, camp out in the Grand Canyon. (funny, yet meaningful don't you think?)  FOLLOW-UP: Walked me to my car and we were saying good night and he leaned in for a very nice kiss on the cheek, and I gave him a hug. We both agreed to get together again.  SUMMARY: Mark has long term potential...in the personality and fun, and similar likes categories...initial physical attraction level was medium...there's some there...but I'm liking his personality and who he is way too much to care at this point. He's handsome...and intelligent, has career goals and personal goals...Now we're getting somewhere.

      The online dating world makes it easy to e-mail and instant message to several gentlemen who I've deemed "top picks".   In this envirnoment you don't have the benfit of body language, the glint of the eyes or the tone of voice to help interpret intentions and true character of a man.  All of this becomes extremely clear when you meet them in person. During the course of ongoing online interchanges that we have, it is easy to speak honestly, and get into topics that most certainly wouldn't get discussed during first dates. I have to admit that right now I'm conversing with two suitors/friends (no dates have been set) that I've shared very personal stuff with, and they have also in return.   This is what I call False Intimacy. You freely communicate online, and then meet in person and it's like you're starting over. In fact, the couple times I have met suitors, I have a hard time even recalling what we had built online up to that point. Usually because their physical behavior or traits don't quite match up with what I've built up in my mind through the online interchanges.  Is it this False Intimacy that gets women to uproot themselves and relocate three states away for some man they "met" online?    I have to believe that I'm approaching this in a realistic way. Always knowing how easy it is to sound good in writing (much like reading a resume, then interviewing the person only to be let down by their whole being).  Afterall, I'm a fairly good writer...have somewhat made a career out of doing it...so I'm sure I sound better in my e-mails, etc. than I may in person. So, the gentlemen may be getting a disappointment when they meet me too.   So, before I get too hard on the guys...I need to remember they are going through similar experiences.   Usually, I'm finding a lull in the face-to-face first date where neither one of us acknowledges what we'd been talking about online. It is almost like we are waiting for permission from one another to discuss it.   I guess the one suitor I finally meet where we're able to pick up where we left off online...will be the first one that I'll know is closer to being a right match for me. Until then, the dating continues, and so does my diary.

      This is the third date I've been on in two weeks. It's getting easier...sort of...but I still have a bit of disappointment after each one.  This Dating Dossier is on Bill.  BACKGROUND:  Bill sent me an icebreaker e-mail. I read his profile and liked what I saw. He's got a good job as an engineer, has a young daughter that he says keeps him grounded. We e-mailed back and forth for a couple weeks about minor details about us, music likes, movies, etc. But I felt we had enough in common to meet in person. He drove down to my town (an hour) to meet me for lunch.  LOCATION & ACTIVITIES: We met at a nice Italian restaurant that I recommended. It is on the upper scale of places to eat in town, and I should have probably picked something lower on the scale. We sat for 3 hours eating and chating. Nothing after lunch was planned. I didn't offer and he didn't offer, so after lunch we parted.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Well, he doesn't own a cell phone, so if something came up before he got here, I couldn't get in touch with him. He drove a Honda Accord and arrived wearing khaki shorts and a nice conservative pull-over shirt, with sandals. He was a smaller man than what he looked like in his pictures. Short, small hands, and overall small features. He seemed nervous at first, and nearly over half way into lunch, seemed to open up a bit more.  HIS HISTORY: He is an engineer who's job brought him to Illinois. Previously lived in the south, and has a southern accent. Divorced about 6 months, a young daughter. Has been online dating for 5 months and has been on 7 or 8 dates from the Yahoo personals.  His ex-wife had battled depression and was abusing credit cards and putting him in debt. He tried to gain control on the finances, she retaliated...threatened and tried suicide. Basically emotional black-mail. He couldn't take the instability and uncertainty of the marriage and left.  PICKS & TICKS: He's got a boyish charm and the southern accent helps that along (pick). but there is the slightest hint of a speech impediment..a problem with "R" in some words(Tick).  Every once in a while he'd break out into what seemed like a very nervous laugh...it sounded cartoonish (tick). but he laughed at my jokes and stories (pick).  He looked down a lot...and didn't sit up and look me eye to eye..only when we got the parking lot where we stood and talked a bit more did he seem to be more purposeful.  Lack a certain amount of assertiveness, even when dealing with the wait staff during lunch.  FUNNY & FREAKY:  Nothing out of the ordinary happened. Pretty mundane date. However; for the freaky category. Bill still has his ex-wife cut his hair since he can't find anyone who cuts it properly. Hmmmm....  FOLLOW-UP: We left it as, "Well, you have my phone number and e-mail, so get in touch."  SUMMARY: Thoroughly enjoyable conversation. Boyish charm, but not nearly as manly and assertive as I'm usually attracted to. I shook his hand and leaned in and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Thanked him for lunch, and told him to be careful driving home.  No sparks. Nothing other than the lingering feeling I just had lunch with a nice man.

      Here's the dating dossier on Dan. He is only the second suitor I've met face-to-face.   BACKGROUND: I sent him an e-mail after I saw is profile. Actually I've contacted only three men total. I figured I wouldn't need to go hunting...they'd come to me. But Dan's photos on his profile got my attention. Not only does he have great blue eyes that shine a little on the onery side, but he was with KISS, yet the full-make-up wearing rock band. So, I had to ask what that was about. You'll find more about this under Funny & Freaky section of his dossier. Then we began instant messaging and e-mailing, and also talked on the phone a couple times.  LOCATION & ACTIVITIES: He met me in my town (on my turf, see the safety tips entry). I suggested eating lunch at a new "deli-like" restaurant in town. It was busy and a bit too noisy for a first date...a bad call on my part.  but, inexpensive and something that wasn't in his town.  Then we went Putt putt golfing...yes I know, again...but he had already been to the zoo the weekend before and in a matinee movie you can't talk and get to know one another...so I suggested a new putt putt course that just opened. We had a rain delay, so we went inside and played pool until it cleared up, and we finished the "back nine".  FIRST IMPRESSIONS: He is more handsome in person, but a bit more self conscious than what he seemed in his e-mails. This went a way a little after we talked more. I have to admit that dealing with him online was easier. I also had suspicions he was still married and out "playing" online. But not the impression I got in person. He's an executive level manager for 70 employees in the building and houskeeping dept. of a large hospital. He came in a Jeep 4X4 sahara edition, which is his second car. The first being a mustang.  HIS HISTORY: Divorced about a year, due to a job he had that kept him away a lot and put him in an environment not conducive to relationship building. (see Funny & Freaky) No kids, but his profile is full of writings about romance, relationships with spark, and wanting to be in a long-term relationship. He wants a family and likes what he does for a living now.  PICKS & TICKS: He's funny and a flirt, also speaks to people and is outgoing(all picks). He is not afraid to ask questions, even the tough ones that make you think about yourself. This could be good in the get-to-know one another phase, but what if it's a longterm thing? How will that affect a relationship? Will it drive me nuts in the long run? He also seems to have a fairly high level of sexual flirting/innuendo. It started online and is harmless, and was harmless in person, but I think it could escalate if left unchecked. Sexual compatibility seemed important to him and seemed to ask questions about my level of sexuality alot. (TICK)  FUNNY and FREAKY: His photos with the band KISS is from when he worked on their tour. I'm not saying what he did here, but lets suffice it to say he and Gene Simmons are very well accquainted and he is friends with the entire band, managers, etc. This is a proven fact, undeniable. (a bit FREAKY, yet FUNNY, if you knew what is job was). He will also be in the bowling hall of fame soon, for some sort of record he set...funny...or freaky, I can't figure out which.   SUMMARY: At first he was reserved a bit, sort of like he was just there because he couldn't get out of it...then he warmed up more once he got comfortable. There is a lot of sexual tension between us...at least up until he kissed me. (I ususally don't do that on a first date, but we know each other fairly well via our online chats and phone conversations).  He's a very aggressive kisser..ummm, felt like he was sucking my whole face...sort of.  I was hopimg for more finesse...but at age 35 can you re-teach a man to kiss? Ha, KISS, that's so ironic..I liked him at first because of the KISS (the band) factor, now I'm wavering because of the "kiss" (suck face) factor.   We both agreed it was worth another date. In fact he straight out asked: "So how do you think it went today?" and I didn't mind answering. (aside from the kiss, which my sis said could have been because he was nervous.)   FOLLOW-UP: I sent him an e-mail when I got home thanking him for the lunch and golf, etc. I told him I remembered I lost a bet at pool and that I owed him dinner. (I always pay my bets and debts.) I asked him to give me a call when he had a chance. I think he's still interested too. We'll see if I keep him on the short list or not...but I do know he's knocked Ted out of the running.

      It is risky enough to be online dating through the personals; however, there are ways to screen and evaluate people who respond to your profile. So I have control over who I talk with via e-mail on the personals site.   One avenue I have never tried is venturing out into chat rooms. I haven't even gone to a chat room on a relevant, burning issue such as the last episode of Friend's.  I just wanted to see what a chat room was like so I went out to the romance section and picked a room that was supposedly populated by people from my state.   I have heard the horror stories of "newbies" being chewed up and spit out by not following rules in the chat rooms and not taking the time to listen (read) for a while before participating.  So I thought I would just sit down and shut up.   Here's what I learned: *No relevant conversations were going on. Mostly sexual chatter and a little banter about sports teams (Da'Bears or the Packers seemed to fuel e-arguments) *Too many people talking. It was hard to follow a conversation once you noticed one happening. *This was all "surface chatter". I was to find out soon that the real conversations were going on elsewhere.  So, if we compare this to a crowded cocktail party, I'm the one sitting along a wall just observing. Trying to pick out one or two conversations in the crowd.  What happened next is the online equivalent of someone walking up and introducing themselves.  I get an Instant Message (IM) from someone....someone in the chat room. Whoa...someone noticed me hanging out in this room. (Your ID comes up on the room list that keeps a running tab on who enters and leaves the room.)  Hungry-7 says: Hi, wanna have a naked guy come over and dance for you?  Now imagine if a guy came up to you in person and said that!! (if this is actually a guy, sometimes you never know.)  What is the online equivalent to a slap in the face? Where are all the true gentlemen?  Dissed -4 says: Hi, Terri. Whoa, shit. This person knows my name. How did he do that? I asked, and Dissed-7 says it was on my profile for Yahoo. (You gotta watch what you fill in on those "necessary" forms.")  So we chatted a while, and he offered to send me a picture.  I was curious and said sure.  He sent me one of him and two bikini clad chicks at a motorcycle show.  It screamed "PARTY BOY". Along with the fact that he kept mentioning his hangover. I moved on--actually I just quit responding to his messages, and he finally went away.  It's not like you can "walk away". He's got my ID now so he can find me anytime I'm on Yahoo. But he's far away and seemed harmless.  One message came from a guy in Africa...gave me his phone number right off the bat. Why? I don't know. Probably a scam of some sort.  I got several offers to see naked women from their web cams. They didn't even know I was a girl or cared. It's the porn businesses that have automated Instant Messages to promote their smut, everyone calls them "bots", short for robots. No real people behind the messages.   When I left the chat room and closed all of the annoying instant messages that speckled my screen, I felt like I needed a shower. I almost felt surrounded by people who were all trying to talk at me at once.  So, if you're thinking you'll meet Mr. Right in a chat room, don't waste your time. Personal profiles are a gold-mine. They help you target what you're looking for, but remember, it's as easy to lie on a profile form as it is to lie in a chat room or on instant messages.  Be smart and selective.  I'm like the government, only USDA prime beef allowed!

      In a previous post: It's Raining Men, I mentioned redflags in profiles or in writings that will make me pass on a suitor.  Here is an example of what I'm talking about.  Jim sent me an Icebreaker, (the online version of a "wink").    I noticed he was from a town where I have family, and he wasn't handsome, in fact a bit geeky looking and I had a moment of weakness and sent him a note thanking him for his Icebreaker and that I was surprise someone as far a way as he was would send me one.   This is what I got back.  See what you think, be sure to read it all! Sigh---and no, I didn't respond. ************************************* JIM AND HIS INFORMATION: Well, it is almost 1 a.m. in the morning on Tuesday. I cann't hardly believe that I started typing this to you an hour ago.   I really hope that it isn't too long.  Dad and I arrived home from the spin on the IL River around 8:30pm. We decided to fill the boat up with gas for the upcoming weekend. July 4th!   I have decided to leave my 17'Lowe Bassboat at my parents home.  I have made plans for dad and I to go fishing with an ole high school buddy this Friday! He knows all of the really great places to catch the Catfish!  I am returning home for only a couple of days this week.  I've been on vacation for the past two weeks! I enjoyed it very much! This is my last week. I go back to work on Sunday night. Yuck!  There's Big Events happening in Beardstown this upcoming weekend!  Beardstown is Celebrating its 175th Birthday!   I am going home tomorrow, after getting my 1999 Toyota Tacoma truck's oil changed in the morning. Do you like how I put that info in there? Now, you know what I drive. lol  I have college class on Tuesday and Thursday nights at Lake Land.  I'm sure you know where Lake Land is? Don't you?  I am a Psychology major. I seem to have come upon psychology by accident.   Oh! I don't know if it was an accident, but I was never interested in this subject: (people and their problems) earlier in my life.   I always said, "Just get over it, Already!" I had no compassion for people with problems.  But, after going through some Really Tough Personal Times in in my own life...ie. divorce/career   And not finding much helpful advice from pastors, friends or even a therapist...  I decided to investigate the possibilities of returning to college and learning the information for myself.  The new information that I've learned, so far, from studying the Bible, going to church weekly and studying at LLC have helped me so much that I want to share it with others that are hurting and are discouraged with their lives.  I know that if I can learn the skills for coping with life's difficulties and then developing the ablity to use them in my daily life to change my circumstances and my own perspectives...then, I believe I can influence others that are hurting, too!  How will I do this?   You may be asking;  By teaching those same skills and other new skills, I am going to be learning in the near future to those that are hurting as I was in the past.   I think I could help people:  1.) who are hurting emotionally...  2.) who are depressed and discouraged with life as it is presently...  3.) find some new information on how to relieve some of their daily suffering.  Now, Just think what I could accomplish when I earn my bachelor's, Masters and eventually a Doctor's degree?  Just Think of all of the Great information that I will be able to share with all of these new people I meet!  You know...  My dream from childhood was to become a doctor. I almost gave up on that dream.  But, that's one thing about America that I love.  I love...  The FREEDOM that I Can Choose to Become Anything that I Put MY Mind to...  Well, now I'm heading in that direction...Finally!   Here are a few things that I love.  I love to go boating, fishing and swimming!   I love anything outdoors!  I love going to school!   I love to spend time with family and the one's I love!   I love to help others.  Just call me Dr. James Brown.   LOL   And, I love to go to church, learn about Jesus and sing about His love for us!  I believe that all of the experiences of my life; especially the difficult ones, have changed my perspective on how I view people and their real life struggles.  I think that life has a way of bringing certain things, even people into our lives at the right time.   I actually found out that I love to read and study about human behavior and the many disorders that are so common in today's society.  My plan is to graduate in the spring of 2005! I'm getting excited about graduating from Lake Land College and then starting school at EIU next summer!   Like I said before, I really hope I didn't get to personal for you. I just wanted to share some of my hopes and dreams for the future with you.  *********  Well, after that, what would we have to talk about on a first date?The upside is I didn't have to sit through a date to find this out! I'm moving on, because I have 75 other guys to evaluate.

      In the online dating world, the process starts with you posting a profile (with or without a photo or two). The profile has cursory information about you, and what you're looking for in a relationship or mate.   Then people searching through the profiles can send you an Icebreaker, which is a pre-populated e-mail note that you can choose from sayings like "Nice smile!" or "Wanna Talk?" or "I like your profile."  The person who sends it has their profile attached to it. I summarize it as the cover letter to a resume about yourself. The Yahoo Personals marketing geniuses call it an "online wink" or "flirt". Very cute, and to do this you have to pay for a three month membership, so that's why I call them geniuses.  Well, I've gotten 65 men (in two weeks) who have sent me "winks" or "flirts". And probably another 15 men who skipped the Icebreaker and just sent a note to my profile mailbox, which is nice because they usually add more information about themselves in an e-mail.  Wow, this is better than all of my years of "bar sitting" in college and again after my divorce! I didn't think the response would be that great.   "Well, dear," mom advises, "It's quality, not quantity."    Hmmmm, yes. I am now forced to begin sorting and selecting those whom I want to reply to...if I reply to them at all.  I clearly put on my profile that I'm intersted in men 33-39 years of age. Yet, I have gotten e-mails from those as young as 21 and as old as 50. They didn't take time to get past my picture and read my profile so, that's my first swing at elimination.   The next level of sorting depends on what the profile says and on what the guy looks like. You can't believe how many don't even put a photo out.  Yes, I sound shallow, but let's face it...if he isn't somewhat good looking or at least mildly attractive I wouldn't be interested even if we were in a bar or met at a grocery store or where ever.  If there are any red flags on the profile or any writings that I find odd and my gut tells me to pass, I pass. I am trying to let my inner instincts guide me too. I've ignored them in the past, and hope to heighten them in this process...for the guys out there reading this, it's like Spidey Senses. You just can't explain it.  Geography also plays a role in my selection. However,I am chatting with several suitors who are 45 miles away or more! But why do I ignore the geography rule for them? They are gainfully employed, handsome...interesting...great sense of humor...and consistently keep in contact with me.  They are fun to talk to online and on the phone.  But there is the extra challenge of long distance dating. The time in traveling back and forth; and tough schedules. Regardless, you have to see if there are sparks...everything else will work out if the relationship is worth it, right?  So far the equation works like this:  "under 33 or over 39 years" + "45 or more miles away" = I pass* *the exceptions: rich, handsome and realy interesting to talk to.  "But what about the nice guys who might not be any of those," you may be saying. It's sweet that you're defending the underdogs, really-- I admire that and I had to resist the urge to do that also...but, well, I'm at a point in my life that I don't want an underdog...I want a top dog. and I deserve it.  I can be as picky as I want to be, because in my online dating world, it's raining men.

      BACKGROUND: I had been e-mailing with J.B. before "Ben", and when I decided to date Ben exclusively, I told J.B. and he was cool with it, and said if it didn't work out, just shoot him a note to see where he was at.  Well, as we all know: It didn't work out.  I re-started our e-mail relationship, only to find out J.B. had met someone, but admitted it wasn't going anywhere.  I told him once he figured out if he was going to keep dating his existing "interest" just let me know.  A week later, he asked me out.  LOCATION & ACTIVITIES: He lives in a town 45 minutes away, so he chose a town "in between" to meet, and chose a pub/restaurant I was familiar with (because there is also one in the town I live).  Actually, this wasn't half-way, as my drive was longer, but oh well.  We agreed to meeting for drinks, but it was going well and he offered to buy me dinner, and I agreed.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Well, he's a bit heavier in person than his picture, and a bit  more bald. but still handsome. He seemed nervous, but I think that was first date jitters. Generally he seemed to have a hard time sitting still, but that may pass as he gets more comfortable around me.  HIS HISTORY: He's never married, but had a live-in girlfriend for several years that he had a child with. She's 4 and pictures of her are adorable. After the girlfriend and daughter moved out, he didn't need his huge house anymore, especially since he was gone on the road most of the week for work. He moved in with his parents and sold his house. He's traveled to Europe, and likes to try new things. He owns land on a private lake, and plans to build a home there someday.   PICKS AND TICKS:  He's close to his family, and mentioned more than once that his parents would "love me" if we got far enough to meet family (PICK). He is gainfully employed, and doing very well (PICK), but is on the road a lot (TICK)...but that can't be helped.  He's a bit loud, but I think it's more on the gregarous or "fun guy" mode than obnoxious.  He's just outgoing all the way around.  FUNNY & FREAKY: Well, I 've thought a lot about this section of J.B.'s dating dossier, and I can't recall anything that fits either of these categories. He's just a hard worker, good father, good son, who likes to have fun in moderation...  FOLLOW-UP: We e-mail daily, and were supposed to go out this week (it has been a week since our first date), but his car broke down somewhere in Kansas and he called to say he had to cancel at the last minute. My mom thinks he's married, as he always wanted to do stuff during the week...but he said he has his daughter every weekend...and then, today, he mentioned doing something this weekend...so I don't think he's married.  SUMMARY: He's worth taking a second date with...I'm not certain about the physical attraction level on my part. He told me my pictures on my profile didn't do me justice...so I went out and new pictures taken...I'll put them on my blog profile for reference if you're interested...ha. (Like I have a huge readership going on or something.

      It's been nearly a week since Ben called it quits and after having my profile back out there, I have to admit my heart isn't in it.  Everyone says that will change after some more time passes. Some other sage advice I've been given by folks:  1. Quit looking so hard...it's when you're not looking that the right one comes a long.  2. This break-up just opens the door for the right guy to come along, there's something better destined for you.  3. Since you dated him about a month, well then it will take two weeks to get over that. (I didn't know there was a magic formula for breakup recovery based on the length of the relationship.)  4. Go to church. (from my mom, of course). There are nice guys at church.  So, now that I'm looking through a "realistic" lens...most of the guys responding to my profile are far from qualified to be considered date-worthy for me.   I am afraid that no matter who I pick to meet, they just won't match up to how I felt about Ben. I am not ready for more disappointment...so I'm going to take this real slow and be cautious about who I meet. and actually not go on a date for a while. I need to sort of decompress from my experience, and square away any residual hurt, anger and restore my slightly broken ego.
