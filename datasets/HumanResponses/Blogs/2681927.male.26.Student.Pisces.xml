      The people at  urlLink Catallarchy.net  keeps up the good job  urlLink arguing against  the protectionists of  urlLink Rescue American Jobs . Even though this time it seems like RAJ saw the light for once.  I want to add to the point that deciding which product you should buy and which you shouldn't is tricky, or rather impossible. And instead of leaving the question to just a few minds, they might be brilliant, it's better to let the market decide. Free trade for everyone please.

      A  urlLink study  by  urlLink this man  and some other people  urlLink made the news (Swedish only) in Sweden the other day. According to the study, only 4 out of 100 Swedes are interested in starting a business or have recently started one. The same number for the US are 12 and top scorer Uganda 29.  Reynolds mentions the size of the public sector, the unemployment benefit schemes and that the population share of younger people are getting lower. Now, regardless of what you think of the welfare state and the size of it (personally, I more or less side with Friedrich Hayek on that issue) the government needs a stable source of income, and if the welfare state harms the entrepreneurship you'll have to ask yourself whether or not the welfare state in the long run actually helps the poor.  urlLink Tyler   urlLink Cowen  have  urlLink written  on that issue.

      The Anarchist's  urlLink smash windows  at a Reclaim the Streets-gathering. The Social Democrats brags about how good everything is in Sweden. Or as the prime minister Goran Persson said,  "A public sector and high taxes, appropriately used, can be a driving force for economic development. We show that here in Sweden" (my translation). In sum, a normal May Day in Sweden. But as the paper Tyler Cowen at Marginal Evolution  urlLink pointed to  the other day shows, any sort of bragging from Goran Persson's side is misplaced. The swedish welfare system does not work today and if he wan't it work tomorrow he have to make sure that new jobs gets created. And that won't probably happen with the taxes we have today.

      If Ayn Rand invented Objectivism, does it mean that Objectivism is a matter of subjectivism? An idea projected on reality by Rand herself? If, instead, Ayn Rand discovered Objectivism, drawing conclusion from reality, does it mean that any claim that Objectivism is a closed system must imply that Rand herself was omniscient and infallible?  Well, I'm not an objectivist, so I don't need to bother really.

       Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee...   The Czechs looked troubled in the first half, not creating very much and letting the Danes play their game. But that seems to be just tactical, because the Czechs destroyed the match in the beginning of the second half and Denmark had no chance. A nice header from Koller and two lovely strikes from Milan Baros in just 15 minutes, and the Danes could go home.  My Man of the Match: Milan Baros.

      It was a close call. One ball deflected into the post and one goal denied for Netherlands. One ball in the post and one hitting the crossbar for Sweden. And that's only in the overtime.   Other than that, the Dutch's had more of ball possession but didn't create chances in the same effect. Sweden had some opportunities that with some more luck could have led to something more than just opportunities.  In the penalty shoot-out, the Dutch players were able to keep cool in a way that the Swedes couldn't. At least, so it seemed.   My Man of the Match: Ruud van Nistelrooy

      Portugal - England 2 - 2 (6 - 5 pen.)  England started with a goal already in the third minute when Michael Owen scored his first of the Euro 2004. Portugal responded by attacking ferociously but without creating the real heat. But just 7 minutes before, Helder Postiga headed the equalizer. England gained a little strength in the continuing minutes and actually scored a second goal, but the referee (mistakenly in my view) called it off.  Portugal's substitute Rui Costa scored Portugals second goal 20 minutes into overtime but England got their second five minutes later when Frank Lampard leveled. In the penalty shot out, David Beckham missed his second penalty in the tournament. Luckily, the Portuguese missed on later as well. In the seventh round, the Portuguese keeper Ricardo saved Darius Vassell poor penalty and then scored the winner against David James himself. Portugal through to the semi finals.  My Man of the Match: Ashley Cole.  France - Greece 0 - 1   On beforehand, it looked like it would be a easy game for France. But France didn't measure up while the Greeks played convincingly. After an even first half, France started the second half better but that only lasted 10 minutes. 20 minutes into second half, Greek captain Zagorakis flew down the right flank and delivered the ball to Charisteas who could head the ball into the net. France tried to put some pressure on the Greeks defense but they stood up strong and the only real opportunity were handed to Henry who headed the ball wide. Greece goes through.  My Man of the Match: Angelos Charisteas.

       urlLink Eric Rasmussen  and  urlLink Micha Ghertner  responds to  urlLink this post  by Cass Sunstein on the topic of property rights.   As I see it :  The notion of property rights is not created by law (or rather, legislation if we allow ourself to remember the distinction made by Hayek between law and legislation). Propert did exist long before any government begun to "enforce" any rights. As H. Scott Gordon concluded:   Stable primitive cultures appear to have discovered the dangers of common property tenure and to have developed measures to protect their resources. Or if a more Darwinian explanation be preferred, we may say that only those primitive cultures have survived which succeeded in developing such institutions.

      And the Germans are out. You could have expected that Germany would start in  tempo furiosi  against the Czechs, playing an attacking game. Well, they didn't until well into second half. By then the two teams had scored one goal each, both equally brilliant, by Ballack and Heinz. After an hour, the Germans got to the grip and started to attack while the Czechs backed down. Germany created a lot of chances, Ballack struck the post and one corner were deflected by a defender on the goalline. Naturally, when a team attacks furiously, the other team scores on a counterattack. This time Milan Baros got the goal.  What the Germans lacked in the Euro 2004 was a forward, one who could cut through the opponents defense. They would need a Jürgen Klinsmann, a Rudi Völler (ironic enough, being the German coach in the Euro 2004 and all) but instead they had Kevin Kuranyi.  My Man of the Match: Michael Ballack.   urlLink Netherlands - Latvia 3 - 0

      A result that the Italians dreaded and have been  the  topic the last couple of days. If the Scandinavian derby ended 2-2, it would mean that Italy, always a favorite to win tournaments like Euro 2004, wouldn't be playing in the quarter finals.  Denmark started best, the Swedish midfielders allowed Thomas Gravesen to be a dominant force, and quite fair, the Danes got to the lead after a lovely strike by Tomasson. This woke the Swedes up, playing more consistently on the opponents side but didn't get closer than a header from Mellberg hitting the post.  Sweden received an early penalty in the second half when the Danish goalie Sorenson tripped Henrik Larsson. Larsson scored and the teams played evenly for 20 minutes when Tomasson yet again managed to put the ball to the net. This virtually paralyzed the Swedes and Denmark were closer to get the third than Sweden their second.  But just before full time, in the 89th minute, Sweden scored the equalizer when Mattias Jonsson (who normally plays in the Danish top division) got the chance. On stoppage time, none of teams wanted to risk anything and the Swedes killed the time.  My Man of the Match: Jon Dahl Tomasson.   urlLink Italy - Bulgaria 2 - 1

      The best match in the Euro 2004 so far. Netherlands took an early lead after a header by Bouma in the 4th minute and yet another goal by van Nistelroij in the 19th. The Czechs came back with their first goal just four minutes later. The rest of the first half continued in high pace and good opportunities at both ends.  After an hour, Dick Advocaat made the same mistake as the Italian coach Giovanni Trapattoni made against Sweden substituting an attacking player for a defensive one. This time it was Paul Bosvelt who replaced the flying dutchman Arjen Robben. This allowed the Czechs to take control of the match and naturally, in the 71st minute, Milan Baros scored a wonderful goal from outside the box.  But the Czechs wasn't satisfied, they managed to scor a third goal just two minutes before full time. Netherlands, then reduced to 10 men, tried to find the equalizer on stoppage time but came never close.  My Man of the Match: Edgar Davids.

       urlLink The Heartland Institute - Heartland President Addresses Common-Sense Environmentalism - by Joseph L. Bast :   My message to libertarians is this:  *Don't be shy about saying you are an environmentalist. Don't let them call you an "anti-environmentalist" or a "right-wing environmentalist." We are the mainstream now. We're not knocking on the door asking for permission to join the movement; we've been here all along. They are the small alien band of ideologues who hijacked the movement in the 1960s, and we have put up with their anti-technology, anti-logging, anti-farming, anti-car, anti-capitalism, and anti-freedom rhetoric long enough. It's time they left the room.  *Tell people you are part of a new generation of environmentalists, a generation that relies on sound science instead of scare tactics and markets instead of government force.   *Freedom is not incompatible with a healthy environment. Without freedom, a health environment cannot be protected.  *And finally, if you know someone who is still a member of the Sierra Club, tell him tear up his membership card and become a member of The Heartland Institute instead.

       urlLink Reason :   "The two Americas picture confirms the worst stereotypes about the opposition shared by loose political coalitions, in effect constructing genuine opposed communities by circulating the idea of them - similar to the way the proletarians in Marxist theory was supposed to awaken to class consciousness via their discovery of shared oppression by the bourgeoisie."

       "Inclusionary zoning has failed to produce a significant number of affordable homes due to the incentives created by the price controls. Even the few inclusionary zoning units produced have cost builders, homeowners, and governments greatly. By restricting the supply of new homes and driving up the price of both newly constructed market-rate homes and the existing stock of homes, inclusionary zoning makes housing less affordable.  Inclusionary zoning ordinances will continue to make housing less affordable by restricting the supply of new homes. If more affordable housing is the goal, governments should pursue policies that encourage the production of new housing. Ending the price controls of inclusionary zoning would be a good start."

       (I'll get by) with a little help from my left hand , perhaps it is David Trezeguet's theme song. The Croatians took the lead early in second half after two goals in 4 minutes, returning from an own goal by unlucky man Igor Tudor. Then 12 minutes later Trezeguet scored the equalizer, but only after a great deal of help from his left hand. Surely, that goal should have been called off. In stoppage time, the Croatians had the chance to get all the three points from this match but Mornar kicked the ball just over from close range.  My Man of the Match: Dado Prso.

      England comes out from the match with three points and a great performance from Wayne Rooney (youngest goal scorer in a EC-finals ever). But that's about it I think. There's still something lacking from the English game, it's almost as they don't cope with the pressure from their fans and the media at home.  My Man of the Match: Wayne Rooney.

      Didn't see more than fragments of the matches so I don't really have so much to say about them. But I did watch when the Russian kepper were sent off and it seems to me that the referee took the wrong decision. At the same time, I had the opportunity to watch some replays of that situation and decide which Terje Hauge couldn't do. But anyway, the referee have to be perfectly sure that when he shows the red card it is deserved. If he or she isn't, they shouldn't send them off.   So the key issue here is whether or not Hauge were in the right position to make a correct decision, and I'm not too sure about that.    urlLink Greece - Spain    1 - 1   urlLink Russia - Portugal 0 - 2

      Germany and Netherlands ends the evening out on a Dutch date. First half began as even as it gets but the Germans slowly got more out of the game and eventually, through a bananenflanke from Torsten Frings, scored the first after 30 minutes. Netherlands tried to reach the German box and create opportunities but the German defense played a consistent game.  Ruud van Nistelrooij managed to get a ball behind past Oliver Kahn 10 minutes before the ref blow his whistle for the last time and I believe the two sides were satisfied/unsatisfied with the result.  My Man of the Match: Michael Ballack

      I guess Latvia have trained a great deal of defense the last couple of weeks, and they got some more training on that subject today. They almost passed the exam as they stood up against the opponents for 73 minutes but then Milan Baros sent the ball to the net equalizing the Latvians first half overtime goal.   The Czechs managed to get another goal pass the Latvian keeper five minutes before the end, securing an opening round victory. Latvia tried its best but that wasn't enough.  My Man of the Match: Karel Poborsky.

       urlLink Hit & Run  links to  urlLink this . Somehow the people that computed the table got it all wrong. What they compare are the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Sales of a company. Now, the GDP is the value of the all the goods and services that is produced during a certain time, most common a year, in a country. But it's not equal to the sales of a company since the GDP only count the  urlLink value added  and not the whole value. So you have to compare the GDP with a company's value added, the result will of course be completely different.

      I don't know what to say... More than that the five goal gap was a little too big. Bulgaria played a consistent first half with some good chances to score but a bad offside trap allowed Sweden to take the lead. The second half started with a few really good opportunities for the Bulgarians to equalize.  But then Henrik Larsson showed why he is regarded as a top scorer. A beautiful header and a yet another goal a minute later took Sweden to a three-nil lead. The rest is more or less history, Bulgaria gave up the game and Sweden managed to score two more goals.  My Man of the Match: Henrik Larsson.

      Yet again Italy starts a tournament in slow pace, expecting the stars to take care of it all. But when Vieri et al disappears from the game, erased by Martin Laursen and his friends in the Danish defense, there's not much left to do for the Italians. Italy had some opportunities to score in both halfs both the Danish keeper Thomas Sorensen played had a great game.  As Gianluigi Buffon also had. The Great Danes (pun intended), with two of their top midfielders missing, played a nice game with good movement and passing. I think Morten Olsen had a nice sleep this night, Giovanni Trapattoni hadn't.  My Man of the Match: Martin Laursen.

      What a weird match. It looked like Svennis' team would win until the Liverpooler Emile Heskey on stoppage time made a bad decision and caused a free kick just outside the box. A brilliant shot from Zidane equalized England's lead from the first half, a nice header from Frank Lampard.  But that wasn't enough, a minute later fellow Liverpooler Steven Gerrard made an even worse decision passing the ball back to the English keeper David James. The ball was intercepted by Thierry Henry who was brought to the ground by James when he tried to pass him. Zidane, just seconds before full time, sealed the ball to the net on the penalty that followed. Now, if only David Beckham had done the same thing with his 20 minutes earlier, the result probably would have gone in England's direction.  My Man of the Match: Actually two, Ledley King and Zinedine Zidane.

      I guessed 15 minutes into  urlLink the game  that the Spaniards would win with at least two goals. Russia were at that point on the defending side and had been so since the start. But 5 minutes later it all changed, Russia stood their ground better and managed to hold the ball more consistently within the team and by the last quarter of the first half the yet scoreless match were completely even.  The second half took of the same way as the first ended until the 60th minute when Spain made two substitutions. One of the players to come on were Juan Carlos Valer�n and he had only been on the pitch for about 10 seconds when he scored the only goal of the match. The rest of match went on evenly with scoring opportunities for both of the teams (Spain actually scored a second goal which were, correctly, called of by the referee). All in all, a much better game with better pace and better passing than the game between Portugal and Greece.  My Man of the Match: Russian defender Aleksei Smertin.

The book's main character is Maria Eriksson, a woman who got raped and battered by her former husband and then, after the divorce, haunted by the same man.  The book is based on a true story, Maria exists in real life. According to  urlLink an article  (Swedish only) in one of the largest Swedish newspaper,  urlLink Aftonbladet , written by Liza Marklund, Maria received asylum in the United States last year. Obviously, the Swedish government can't take care of it's own citizens. But I'm not surprised actually, the Social Democrats have made cuts in the funding for the police and the judicial system throughout the years to be able to sustain the flawed welfare programs so what else can one expect.

In fact, GDP per capita is lower in the vast majority of the EU-countries (EU 15) than in most of the individual American states. This puts Europeans at a level of prosperity on par with states such as Arkansas, Mississippi and West Virginia.

       urlLink Craig Newmark   urlLink points  to  urlLink this article  in the Chicago Tribune.   The article says:   "Adjusted for inflation, average hourly wages for non-farm workers, excluding managers and executives, rose 25 cents, to $15.35, between 2001 and 2003. That equates to an annual increase of less than 2 percent, or below the rate of inflation."   So lets see, first we adjust for inflation. Then we calculate how much the wages increased and finish with the comparison between the increased wage and the inflation that we just adjusted for. Just brilliant my dear.

      From the  urlLink Cato Institute ,  urlLink Democrats' Challenge on Tax Complexity :   "After the GOP assumed power in 1995, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer promised to 'rip the income tax out by its roots.' In a 1996 report, Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich argued: 'The current tax system is indefensible. It is overly complex, burdensome, and severely limits economic opportunity for all Americans. We made clear on the very first day of the 104th Congress that our top priority would be to change the status quo . . . there is no status quo that needs more fundamental changing than our tax system.'"    "Unfortunately, it was all talk with little action: The GOP has not moved major tax reform legislation through Congress. Republicans did enact tax cuts in 1997, 2001, and 2003 that included pro-growth reforms. However, many features of these bills increased tax code complexity. For example, the 1997 bill included 11 narrow education tax breaks including a tuition tax credit, an education IRA, and a student loan interest deduction."    "The result has been that tax complexity has spiraled upward... After a decade of GOP rule, the number of pages of federal tax rules (tax code, regulations, and IRS rulings) has increased almost 50 percent. Tax forms and instructions are longer, individuals are spending more on tax advice, and there are more social engineering provisions in the code."    "Yet there is no shortage of simplification ideas that might gain bipartisan support. In 2001, the Joint Committee on Taxation issued a 1,300-page report full of reform proposals, such as abolishing the alternative minimum tax, a complex add-on tax that will hit 30 million households by 2010. Steny Hoyer recently noted that "we need to obviously deal with the AMT." The GOP ignored the JCT report when it came out, but now they should challenge Hoyer and the Democrats to help them repeal the AMT and pursue other reforms. "   "In the 1980s, tax reform was a bipartisan concern. Prominent Democrats, such as Dick Gephardt, and liberal think tanks, such as the Brookings Institution, proposed some serious reform plans. Democrats introduced flat tax legislation long before Dick Armey proposed his plan in 1994. Within months of economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka unveiling the original flat tax in 1981, Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Representative Leon Panetta of California introduced versions in Congress."   You can find some of Hall and Rabushka's thoughts in their book  urlLink The Flat Tax , available online. Such a tax code already exists in some of the former communist countries in  urlLink Eastern Europe .  Personally, while I see the flat tax as a nice thought, it  urlLink might not be  such a good idea anyway. Still, there's a need for a less complicated tax code, both in the United States and in Sweden. But I'm not very optimistic, it seems like there always some problems that the politicians want to "correct" through taxation, not least notably income distribution.

      Via  urlLink Magnifisyncopathological  I found this article in Slate,  urlLink Tour De Lance - The international press snipes at America's superhero  by Susan Daniels. She mentions four articles, but I can only agree on two of them, perhaps the third as well.   I grant the first and the second article, even though drug abuse story shouldn't be brushed aside too easily. His connections with  urlLink Michele Ferrari  is "fishy". I don't agree with La Tribune de Geneve's words, "Mankind is not fond of those who gorge themselves on success without suffering and without showing compassion for their fellows" and that it's applicable to Lance Armstrong. From what I heard, he gave the stage to La Mongie to Ivan Basso, because Basso's mother is suffering in cancer. Whether or not it's true, I don't know. Secondly, it really looked like he wanted to give the stage to Le Grande Bornand to his team mate Floyd Landis who did a terrific job for Lance on that stage (and on all the other stages as well). Thirdly, I can't imagine how the Geneva-paper's words match together with  urlLink Livestrong  and the  urlLink Lance Armstrong Foundation .   But I have doubts about the other two, it sounds more or less like shooting the messenger. I mean, you can't really blame Daily Post&nbsp;or Times for reporting on what the French people thinks about Lance Armstrong. But I might concede the point if the poll that the Daily Post mentions is staged in one way or the other, but then&nbsp;the French news paper who conducted the poll should be blamed (and I don't find it likely that it is staged).   According to cyclingnews.com, the Dutch news paper  urlLink Trouw &nbsp;went along the same line as El Pais,  urlLink questioning Armstrong's preparations . More headlines  urlLink here .&nbsp;But I somehow feel that the claim that Europeans dislike Lance Armstrong is overexaggerated.&nbsp;As  urlLink I pointed out  a couple of days ago, the reason for the dislikening that do exist is not necessarily because&nbsp;he's an American. Daily Post claims that the French poll showed that the Formula 1 champion Michael Schumacher was the most disliked sportsman in France, and&nbsp;Schumacher is, like Lance in the TdF, a little bit too good for the other contenders. If that is one of the reasons, then I would say it's flattering. Yet, the French footballer Nicholas Anelka recieved the second place, and I would guess it was because he's rather ignorant from time to time, so one shouldn't be too sure on how they depict Armstrong.   At the same time, the&nbsp;"war"&nbsp;between  urlLink Armstrong and Simeoni  that I mentioned in my post the other day  urlLink rages on (scroll down a bit). But I don't think that dog will bark. It's time for them, Armstrong and Simeoni, to call it a day and move on.

In the episode, Springfield legalizes gay marriage, and Homer Simpson becomes a minister by registering online. Matt Groening, the show's creator, joked that Homer is the one to come out as gay. Information leaked across the net has already told us that Patty Bouvier will be the one coming out next season."

      I find this disturbing. Even though both Yahoo ! and Google are allowed to support the Chinese government, it doesn't mean that they should. First of all, supporting a repressive government, of any sort, is morally wrong. Secondly, people uses both Yahoo ! and Google to find information. If the information is believed to be "tainted" or if it is unavailable, people will most likely use another search engine if possible. In other words, there might be a short-run profit to make, but not necessarily a long-run profit.   From  urlLink Reporters sans frontières (Reporters without borders).      ..."irresponsible" policies of major US Internet firms Yahoo ! and Google in bowing directly and indirectly to Chinese government demands for censorship and called for a code of conduct to be imposed.     Yahoo ! has been censoring its Chinese-language search-engine for several years and rival firm Google, which recently took a share in Baidu, a Chinese search-engine that filters a user's findings, seems ready to go the same way. In their efforts to conquer the Chinese market, the two firms are "making compromises that directly threaten freedom of expression"    ...    Some combined key-word searches, such as "Free Tibet," do not display any results. For others, only official sites appear. The top results of a search for 'Falungong" produces only sites critical of the Chinese spiritual movement in line with the regime's position. The same search using a non-censored search-engine turns up material supporting Falungong and about the government's repression of its followers.     Google has so far refused to censor its search-engine and access to it was blocked for a week in September 2002 by the Chinese authorities, who are currently obliged to filter its search results by themselves, which is more difficult and less effective.     Google now seems to have changed tack. In June this year, it acquired a substantial share in one of China's biggest search-engines, Baidu, which carefully filters out all "subversive" content. When Google was blocked in 2002, Chinese Internet users were redirected to baidu.com. A search in Baidu for "Huang Qi," a cyber-dissident imprisoned for posting criticism of the government online, produced : "This document contains no data," even though hundreds of articles in Chinese have been posted about him.     A search for "independence Taiwan" shows only sites critical of the island's government, while Google's Chinese version (www.google.com/intl/zh-CN [that page doesn't seem to exists/Dennis] ), which is not censored, comes up with pro-Taiwan sites.

      Alex Tabarrok has a post on  urlLink Lance Armstrong and game theory . He refers to a Stephen Tuel, who claims that the 18th stage of the Tour de France was “an excellent example of game theory at work”. I can’t really concur with Tuel, in my opinion Armstrong acted irrationally.   Last Friday, the 18th stage went from Annemasse to Lons-le-Saunier in the east of France (if you have a map, try to find Geneva, Annemasse is situated east of the city, but on the French side of the border. Lons-le-Saunier is to the northwest, between Geneva and Dijon). The stage is fairly short, just 166 kilometres, and a breakaway manages to get some time on the peloton after 9 km.   After 32 km or so, the Italian rider Filippo Simeoni tries to reach the breakaway, the gap between group in the lead and the peloton is just under one minute so there’s a fair chance that he will succeed. The problem,&nbsp;though, is&nbsp;that Lance Armstrong, riding in the yellow jersey, follows Simeoni and when the two reaches the break, everyone knows that the break is dead. There’s no chance that Armstrong’s contenders will let him get away, and extend his lead, on this stage.   So Armstrong, and Simeoni, backs down to the Peloton. Eventually, the break extends the gap and one of the riders in front, the Spaniard Mercado, wins. Now, according to Stephen Tuel, Armstrong went away because he wanted the other teams, first and foremost T-Mobile (with Andreas Klöden and Jan Ullrich) to do some work in the peloton as well. That was the consequence of Armstrong’s breakaway, but not the intended consequence as I see it.   First of all, US Postal wasn’t in the lead of the peloton at the time Simeoni and Armstrong tried to bridge the gap. Instead, the Swiss team Phonak was riding first. Phonak’s Tour was until then more or less disastrous, their captain, the American Tyler Hamilton, had to  urlLink leave the Tour early  because of an injury. Hamilton was supposed to be threat to Armstrong in the struggle for the yellow jersey. This was their last chance to win a stage and their rider Nicolas Jalabert managed to get away with the others in the breakaway. Unfortunately,&nbsp;Jalabert got a flat tire and was caught by the peloton. Therefore, Phonak didn’t want the group in the lead to win so they started the chase. As it happened, US Postal didn’t need to do all the work until Phonak gave up, then Armstrong’s team just cruised along in the front for a while until T-Mobile got into action.&nbsp;   Secondly, US Postal would want to do the work in the peloton anyway. Sure, they’ll catch the wind but at the same time they can decide the pace and make sure that none of the riders who are a real threat to Lance can get away. There is no chance that CSC (Ivan Basso’s team) or T-Mobile will help US Postal with this, it would have hurt them as well. When Armstrong and Simeoni got back to the peloton, US Postal rode in front&nbsp;of the peloton almost the whole stage, T-Mobile didn't have any share to work.   Thirdly, the rider that Armstrong followed, Filippo Simeoni, isn’t just any rider in the way Tuel mentions him. Sure enough, Simeoni will never win the Tour and he was well behind Armstrong this year. But it’s more to it than that.   A couple of years ago, Simeoni got suspended for using EPO to enhance his performance. He admitted his doping in connection to a hearing against the Italian physician Michele Ferrari. According to Simeoni, Ferrari had helped him when he took EPO and growth hormone. Now, Michele Ferrari is a well known doctor when it comes to cycling, a lot of riders have used him during the years.   One of those riders is none other than Lance Armstrong. After Simeoni’s allegations against Ferrari, Armstrong defended his doctor and called, in public, Simeoni a liar. Simeoni then filed a lawsuit against Armstrong, accusing him of slander, and demanded 100,000 Euros. According to the Italian, he never said anything about Armstrong in the hearing, he only told them about his experience with Ferrari.   So the reason why Armstrong chased after Simeoni seems to be personal, he didn’t want Filippo Simeoni to win that stage. There are indications along that line, also from US Postal, but Armstrong’s team manager Johan Bruyneel later changed his mind. Armstrong himself claimed that he acted on the behalf of the peloton. But there’s no reason why he should get Simeoni back to the peloton himself, he has a whole team that works for him to do that.   Instead, Armstrong took a huge risk. Even though the peloton wasn’t going in the highest pace at the time, it’s not very easy to get away and you will lose energy. With an important time trial the day after, Armstrong could have, even though it’s not very likely, lost the yellow jersey. That’s why he acted irrationally.    urlLink Live feed from the 18th stage .    urlLink More on cycling, doping and Michele Ferrari .   Update: Educated Guesswork  urlLink agrees .

      The question will&nbsp;inevitably come up, is  urlLink Lance Armstrong ,&nbsp;with his&nbsp; urlLink six &nbsp;victories in&nbsp;the Tour de France, the best cyclist ever? But in my opinion, that question* is impossible to answer. Armstrong won six years in a row, struggled against and defeated cancer the years before his first victory and so on. But how do one compare his achievemens with, say  urlLink Jacques Anquetil ,  urlLink Eddy Merckx ,  urlLink Bernard Hinault  and  urlLink Miguel Indurain  who won the TdF five times plus various other important competitions? Merckx for instance, also&nbsp;won Giro d'Italia five times, Vuelta España once and three World Championships.   And what about  urlLink Fausto Coppi &nbsp;who "only" won twice in the Tour de France, but five times in the Giro d'Italia. He started his career in the beginning of the second World War but then the&nbsp;war interrupted the competitions.  All these&nbsp;are great cyclists, and will (and should) be remembered and admired as such. But to say that anyone of them is better than the rest is highly dubious in my opinion.   * Rather, such questions, because there are many in the same "area". Who was the worst, Hitler, Stalin, Mao or Pol Pot&nbsp;is another.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      As&nbsp;I&nbsp; urlLink predicted &nbsp;last sunday, Lance Armstrong was far better than Ivan Basso in the time trials and Lance wins his sixth Tour de France in a row. And that's&nbsp;new records, both when it comes to wins in consecutive years and total number of wins.&nbsp;I know that there's&nbsp;a stage tomorrow, but it won't change the podium.  This years number two, Andreas Klöden, is&nbsp;6 minutes and 38 seconds behind (last year 1.01 mins.), a gap that is about 2 minutes larger than the average for the&nbsp;last 30&nbsp;years&nbsp;(4.46 mins., my calculation).&nbsp;But the gap is the third smallest that Lance have had.   Podium and time gaps:   2004:  1. Lance Armstrong  2. Andreas Klöden&nbsp;+6.38 3. Ivan Basso&nbsp;+6.59  2003: 1. Lance Armstrong 2. Jan Ullrich&nbsp;+1.01 3. Alexander Vinokourov&nbsp;+4.14  2002: 1. Lance Armstrong 2. Joseba Beloki +7.17 3. Raimondas Rumsas +8.17  2001: 1. Lance Armstrong  2. Jan Ullrich +6.44 3. Joseba Beloki +9.05  2000: 1. Lance Armstrong 2. Jan Ullrich +6.02 3. Joseba Beloki +10.04  1999: 1. Lance Armstrong 2. Alex Zülle +7.17 3. Fernando Escartin +10.36  The smallest gap ever is 8 seconds when&nbsp;Greg LeMond won and Laurent Fignon finished second 1989. &nbsp;Fignon had&nbsp;50 seconds&nbsp;down on LeMond&nbsp;when the last stage, an individual time trial from Versailles to Paris, started.  The largest gap is 2 hours 49 minutes and 35 seconds from the very first Tour de France in 1903. Maurice Garin was the winner.  ( urlLink Source )

      Two articles that I want to recommend:      urlLink Sins of the Mother . An interview with the journalist  urlLink Bertina Röhl &nbsp;at the  urlLink Stockholm Spectator . It was Röhl who cracked the story on Joschka Fischer and his past a couple of years ago. And by the way, Röhl is  urlLink Ulrike Meinhof's  daughter.    "The RAF was shrouded in myth from day one. People spoke of Baader being liberated with the help of my mother. But the wording is all wrong. He wasn’t liberated; it was a violent break-out. Out of this emerged the myth of a glossy, gun-toting group with magnificent ideas in their heads about freeing Baader in the name of a higher ideal. The horror of the whole episode was submerged. Stefan Aust [RAF-chronicler and Spiegel editor] is the one who really put a Bonnie and Clyde spin on all of this, despite his full knowledge of how awful it really was. The aims of these people were never mentioned. It finally came out that what they wanted was a sort of North Korean scenario and we can all be extremely thankful that they didn’t succeed. Baader and Meinhof had contacts with the North Korean government in their underground days and dreamed of retiring there if they were released from prison. I’m sure they didn’t know what such a dream would entail in reality."    &nbsp;   urlLink Hating America . Bruce Bawer writes in the  urlLink Hudson Review &nbsp;about the Europeans and their (our) view of the U.S. (Link via  urlLink Virginia Postrel )    . . . No wonder so many smart, ambitious young Europeans look for inspiration to the United States, which has a dynamism their own countries lack, and which communicates the idea that&nbsp; life can be an adventure and that there’s important, exciting work to be done. Reagan-style “morning in America” clichés may make some of us wince, but they reflect something genuine and valuable in the American air. Europeans may or may not have more of a “sense of history” than Americans do . . . but America has something else that matters—a belief in the future.

      A while ago I  urlLink mentioned  Åke Green, a Pastor who got sentenced to one month in jail and a fine for "agitation" against homosexuals. Well, the information have now reached  urlLink The Westboro Baptist Church  in Topeka, KS, and they will  urlLink protest  against this.   "God is not mocked!" God Hates Fags! & Fag-Enablers!  Ergo , God hates Sweden with an irreversible hatred for same-sex marriage and for criminalizing Gospel preaching!   And who's to blame for this? Apparently, our king, Carl XVI Gustaf.   Whatever of past glory Sweden could heretofore have boasted, Sweden is now and forever shall be famous for only one thing, to wit: Sweden is where the machinery of the King Karl[sic] XVI Gustaf's criminal law was cranked up and jailed a humble Gospel preacher - Pastor Ake Green - for declaring truth about faggot maggots.   That the Swedish king has no power what so ever, he's certainly not the one who decide the law in Sweden, seems to have escaped WBC. But I liked the "faggot maggots" part, very poetic.  And to finish it off:   America´s only hope is to immediately break off all diplomatic relations with Sweden, stop all flights to and from Stockholm, criminalize all trade with Sweden, freeze all Swedish bank accounts in America and use the money to support those prosecuted under the Swedish faggot law, boycott and embargo all things Swedish.   Okay, as long as you don't over-react.  (Thanks to  urlLink Gudmundson  for the pointer)

      Via  urlLink PrestoPundit , I found  urlLink this post  at  urlLink The Indepundit &nbsp;which I found troublesome. Not the obvious part, that spectators spat at and gave Lance Armstrong the finger, because you probably need to be drunk to see anything good in that. Being a cycling afficionado, I really think that this sort of behavior don't belong along the road.  What troubles me this time is that Greg at PrestoPundit and many of the commenters at The Indepundit blames the French people. The  urlLink Reuters-article &nbsp;that the post links to&nbsp;mentions one&nbsp;nationality, the Germans. Other than that, it's just the neutral "fans". The  urlLink picture &nbsp;were&nbsp;a spectator gives Lance the finger shows that it's not a French, but a Basque*. But still, France gets all the blame. I'm not saying that no French said stupid things or spat at him, but just blaming the French is equally stupid as I see it.  I'm not very fond of the "explanation" the Indepundit gives either, "[b]ecause, you know, Armstrong is an American, and Bush is Hitler." One of Lance's main competitor, Jan Ullrich,&nbsp;comes from Germany and some other from Spain, one of them the Basque Iban Mayo, who were far behind Armstrong at this stage. Cycling is huge in the Basque country and in Germany, so if their favourite gets crushed by Armstrong, they will get angry**. The "Armstrong is an American" is&nbsp;one explanation, but not the only one and not the most likely.  You may dislike France and the French people if you like, but don't be ignorant while you're at it.  *  The reason why I know it's a Basque is because (a) he's wearing an orange t-shirt, shorts and bandana, orange is the "Basque" color, (b) just behind the man there's another man, holding a Basque flag and (c) the picture is most likely taken in the Pyrenees, just north of the Basque country. It's likely&nbsp;because the rider just behind Lance is the Italian Ivan Basso, and there's just those two riders. There were two stages in the Pyrenees this year, both of them ended in a similar fashion with Armstrong and Basso riding alone in the end. The picture couldn't have been taken at Alpe d'Huez since the fans couldn't get so close, there were fences in the way,&nbsp;when Armstrong catched and passed Basso in the time trial.    &nbsp;  ** That's an explanation, not an excuse.

      Not necessarily, but I think it is. The Tour de France that is. Lance Armstrong and Ivan Basso (not to mention Armstrong's team mate Jose Azevedo) had a superb&nbsp;yesterday on the&nbsp;stage from Lannemezan to Plataeu de Beille in the Pyrenees. Armstrong is second on the&nbsp;GC and Basso third,&nbsp;the gap&nbsp;is one minute and 17 seconds. Armstrong is 22 seconds behind the leader, young Thomas Voeckler but he won't keep the yellow jersey for long, he will probably lose it on Tuesday.  &nbsp;  The other contenders are far behind, so the battle is between Armstrong and Basso. There are&nbsp;four mountain stages in the Alps (one time trial) and yet another time trial next week. Since Lance is the better of the two in time trials, Basso needs to outperform Armstrong with a couple of minutes in the Alps. At the moment, it doesn't sound very likely that that is going to happen. So, sixth TdF in six years for Lance Armstrong. Impressive, impressive in deed.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      There is an ongoing debate in the blogosphere after  urlLink this piece  by Steven Landsburg on minimum wages appeared in Slate. For some reactions, look  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  Econ 101 tells you that if you set up a price floor, then the supply exceeds the demand which in the case of minimum wages means unemployment. There are some problems with this very simple text book analysis. First of all, as Tyler Cowen points out, the wages are not the expenses employers have that can be related to the employees. If you raise the minimum wage, the employers might lower other expenses at the same time which means that they don't necessarily have to lay people off.   The second problem I want to put forward is a problem that is very much related to the neoclassical analysis as such. This kind of analysis is what you will find in any standard Econ textbook. Beginning from the framework of a partial or general equilibrium, a price floor set above the equilibrium price will have the effect mentioned above. The problem is that in the real world, the market is not necessarily in equilibrium. In my view, it is even very unlikely that the market ever is in such a state (even though there are equilibrating forces).  Consider the following scenario. The related market have a equilibrium price P. The minimum wage is set at a price below P, at P mw . Under normal circumstances there wouldn't be any problems, the market would offer a wage above the minimum wage. But the circumstances don't need to be normal. It might be the case that the minimum wage in one way or the other becomes "institutionalized". What I mean is that the wages are sticky, not just downwards, but also upwards due to an institution. An institution is in this context a rule behaviorour in society. This rule might have been created as a spontaneous order, by "human action but not by human design". The employers offer the minimum wage and the employees don't question this offer until they worked for quite a while (and if the minimum wage "spell" is short enough, they might never question it). The minimum wage thus becomes ceiling more than a floor,unforeseenseen negative effect.  This means also that the government can raise the minimum wage without creating unemployment. The tricky thing is to know the limit of the raise, and that might be "to wish impossible things". Is this scenario plausible? I don't know, but I wouldn't rule it out as entirely implausible.  Update: Some interesting thoughts from  urlLink Steven Horwitz .

      On this day, July 12th, in 1794,  urlLink Horatio Nelson  lost his right eye. So if you stroll by Trafalgar Square in London, tell him to cheer up and ask him why the hell he went to Corsica in the first place.  And if that's not enough, exact 100 years ago,  urlLink Pablo Neruda , who won the Nobel Prize in literature 1971, was born.

      Nice post from  urlLink Stefan Geens  on a recent trial in Sweden where a pastor got sentenced to one month in jail and fined the equivalent to 3600$. All this for his "agitation against ethnic group", in this case the "ethnic" group was homosexuals. Read  urlLink this post  for some background information.

       urlLink Environmental porn (adult contents... warning... blah blah blah)   “Fuck for forest” are concerned youngsters, fighting to preserve the environment. We believe it is possible to use people’s need for sexuality as a way to raise money for nature. And create interest for preserving our forests. It is time to pay respect, and give something back. Fuck for forest, and give the profit to the earths threatened nature..."   And they  urlLink made a little scene  a couple of days ago at the Quart Festival in Kristiansand, Norway.

       urlLink Reason :    "Meanwhile, some conservatives will no doubt use Moore's movie as a justification for nastiness and demagoguery on the right. Is Michael Moore the counter-Ann Coulter? Is Ann Coulter the counter-Michael Moore? Either way, the vicious cycle keeps getting more vicious. Just recently, the Bush-Cheney reelection campaign contributed to the Moorification (or Coulterization) of public discourse with a television ad that juxtaposed Hitler images with ones of Al Gore and John Kerry. Their excuse? The Hitler images were taken from two ads comparing Bush to Hitler, briefly hosted by the democratic fund-raising group MoveOn.org earlier this year among some 1,500 entries in a contest. In other words, they started it. (At least MoveOn.org removed the spots and expressed regret over their appearance.)   Maybe Michael Moore is a man for our time. That's a pretty damning indictment of our time."

      Then maybe they could lower the taxes. According to a survey made by the  urlLink Swedish Tax Payers Association (Swedish only) and the survey company  urlLink Demoskop , the Swedish average tax on income should be 36 percent. Compared with the actual average tax, that's 27 percentage points lower than todays 63 percent. Of course, if the public believes that the average tax are much lower than they really are, such comparisons would be quite flawed. But when asked, their opinion was that todays average tax is 59 percent, not so far from the truth.  One interesting point is that you could note some differences between left/right-voters, such as that voters to the right wanted lower taxes compared with voters from the left which is not very surprising. But the differences were not that large, the range went from 35 percent at the low end to 41 percent at the high end.  Surveys like this are troublesome and should not be taken too serious. For instance, if those who answer the survey don't make the connection between a tax reduction and cuts in the welfare system, they will probably overestimate the reduction they want. At the same time, the Swedish welfare system is flawed so they might as well want a reduction so that the taxes equals what you actually receive in return.   urlLink Summary and link to the survey (Swedish only).

      Swedish media reports today that competition lowers food prices. It is based on a study made by a pensioner organization where they compare the prices of food baskets from various parts of the country. I can't imagine what they will report on tomorrow, perhaps that apples fall to the ground because of gravity.

      I would've laughed three weeks ago if someone said to me then that Greece would win Euro 2004. But here we are now, the day after the final and Greece are the winners. Not, in my opinion, due to an outstanding attacking play but to an excellent defense.   The first half of the final against Portugal ended without any goals, a result that must be regarded as fair. Portugal started the second half in higher speed but it was the Greeks who scored the first, and only, goal of the match. Portugal tried to equalize but lacked in concentration.  My Man of the Match: Theodoros Zagorakis.  I would have prefered another country to win, the Czechs played the best football in the tournament but a moment of bad defending decided that the Greeks should win that semi-final.

      Portugal - Netherlands 2 - 1  Portugal started Euro 2004 with a poor performance against Greece. But their game have improved remarkably since then and the first hour against Netherlands where their best so far.   Portugal got into the lead after a header by Ronaldo in the 26th minute and in the 58th, Maniche extended to 2-0 after a beautiful strike. The Dutch's regained some strength after a Portuguese own goal five minutes later and Netherland pushed forward, trying to get the second goal. They had some opportunities but didn't reach far enough.  My Man of the Match: Luis Figo  Greece - Czech Republic 1 - 0 (silver goal)  The Czechs started out completly different compared to their match against Denmark. This time they attacked immediately after kick off. They hade some really good chances but after their playmaker Pavel Nedved got forced off due to an injury, Greece got higher up on the pitch. Both teams had a fair amounts of chances but the Czechs where a little bit closer to get the first. Never the less, after 90 minutes the match were still tied at 0-0 and silver goal started.   Greece started SG in an attacking style, creating good opportunities and were eventually awarded a corner which Dellas could head into the net. At that point were there only seconds remaining of the first SG half and the Czechs didn't have the time to equalize.  My Man of the Match: Jan Koller.

      The blogging have been light the last week. It's all because of the summer that decided to show up at last (except for some heavy lightening last thursday). But you can't stay out in the sun all days without doing some reading (at least I can't), so here's some suggestions.   urlLink Simulating the New Economy   by Gunnar Eliasson, Dan Johansson and Erol Taymaz .    Abstract:   The IT, the Internet, or the Computing & Communications (C&amp;C) technology revolution has been central to the economic discussion for several decades. Before the mid-1990s the catchword was the “productivity paradox” coined by Robert Solow, who stated in 1987 that “computers are everywhere visible, except in the productivity statistics”. Then the New Economy and fast productivity growth fueled by C&amp;C technology suddenly became the catchword of the very late 1990s. Its luster however, faded almost as fast as it arrived with the dot.com deaths of the first years of the new millennium. With this paper we demonstrate that the two paradoxes above are perfectly compatible within a consistent micro (firm) based macro theoretical framework of endogenous growth. Within the same model framework also a third paradox can be resolved, namely the fact that the previous major New Industry creation, the Industrial Revolution, only involved a handful of Western nations that had got their institutions in order. If the New Economy is a potential reality, one cannot take for granted that all industrial economies will participate successfully in its introduction. It all depends on the local receiver competence to build industry on the new technology. We, hence, also demonstrate within the same model the existence of the risk of failing altogether to capture the opportunities of a New Economy.     urlLink Liberty, Markets and Environmental Values: A Hayekian Defence of Free Market Environmentalism   by Mark Pennington       Abstract:   Communitarian conceptions of the 'situated self' lie at the core of 'green' critiques of market approaches to environmental problems. According to this perspective resource management issues should be dealt with in the 'public sphere' of democratic politics rather than the 'private sphere' of market drien consumer choice. This paper suggests that such arguments rest on a series of non-sequiturs. Drawing on Hayek's non-rationalist liberalism it shows that a 'situated' view of the self offers a radical endorsement of the case for privatisating environmental assets, wherever it is possible to do so.     urlLink Competence in Health Care - An Industrial Systems Analysis Using Competence Bloc Theory to Compare European and US Health Care   by Gunnar Eliasson and Åsa Eliasson       Abstract:   While European health care systems are mostly public and similar the contrast is large to the US health industry based to a large extent in the market. Using competence bloc theory the industrial potential of Swedish and European health care is assessed and compared with US health industry. To get the the analysis properly framed health industry is defined to include health insurance, health care and the supporting biotech, pharmaceutical and medical instrument industries. A gradually aging industrialized world makes wealthy customers demand the sophisticated life quality enhancing medical support new technology offers. The overwhelming influence of substitute customership in Europe, through politicians, social insurance, doctors etc., however, holds back development through suppressing the preferences of the true customer (the patient), discouraging innovative product competition and entrepreneurship. The larger part of cost escalation in US health care can be attributed to quality improvements, and luxury health care has stimulated innovative product development. While Swedish health care so far has been a technological winner, commercial competence to become internationally competitive is lacking. It appears politically difficult to recognize that private for profit health care may be both more efficient and profitable than publicly run services. However, once competition for profit has been introduced public providers have to improve performance and the differences will disappear.     urlLink WHAT IS WRONG WITH NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMICS (And What is Still Wrong With Austrian Economics)  by Peter Boettke   urlLink HACER :  urlLink Cuba economy hinges on Chávez vote   by Richard Brand    urlLink Timothy Sandefur's   urlLink Libertarian Bookworm :  urlLink The Calculus of Consent   by James M.

      Saddam Hussein wants to spend the time before his trial  urlLink in a Swedish prison . Saddam's lawyer says:     "Prisons in Sweden seem to be more comfortable than in other places. Besides, Sweden has historically been a neutral country."     Well, he could have added that the Swedish prisons seem to have revolving doors, you're free to pass in and (mostly I guess) out whenever you want by the look of it. Last wednesday, four dangerous criminals escaped from the prison Hall, south of Stockholm. One of them, Tony Olsson, and two others killed two policemen five years ago after running away from a bank rob. One of the other escapees, Daniel Mairona, escaped from another prison, Kumla, last winter and from Hall two years ago.  Luckily, the police force made a good job and all four of them got caught pretty soon. What followed naturally was a debate on the security of the prisons in Sweden. But that debate obviously didn't lead to anything.  Because just about an hour ago, four other criminals  urlLink escaped from the prison in Norrtälje , north of Stockholm. All these prisons, Kumla, Hall and Norrtälje, are supposed to be high security prisons. After the escape last week, the opposition called for the minister of justice to resign. Will he do it now?   Update:  I was wrong, it was three inmates who escaped from Norrtälje today, not four.  An interesting feature though is that one of the escapees, Peter Bottany, is the chairman of the National Trust Council who works for the sake of the inmates. Another interesting feature is that Bottany and three others wrote an article in one of the biggest Swedish newspaper,  urlLink Dagens Nyheter , last friday. The headline to the  urlLink article  is "The isolated gets desperate"(Isolerade blir desperata).  More:    The aim [of the correction system] must reasonably be to create a change among the convicted, not to break them down mentally so that they act desperately.     Yes, I agree. But I'm puzzled since the one who wrote this escaped himself five days later. Does that mean that Bottany (who studies psychology while imprisoned) was desperate when he and the others wrote the article? Not unlikely. The escape as such sounds well planned. They were helped by three masked and armed men from the outside. Also, the getaway car is registered on an inmate at Norrtälje so they got some help from people on the inside as well. The plans must have been made before last friday.   Update 2 (9th August):  One of them got caught yesterday afternoon and the two others early this morning.

       urlLink Michael Munger took a trip to Cuba , sounds interesting enough.   I traveled to Cuba recently, and got to form my own impressions. I went on an educational exchange program, exempting me from U.S. travel restrictions. With some other American academics, I gave a series of lectures at the Center for the Study of the United States, at the University of Havana. Our hosts were particularly impressed with my color overheads. Being well paid to make the trip, I paid for the overheads myself rather than bill them to Duke—they had cost me about $1.50 per page to produce. Our hosts were professors and were also well paid, earning in some cases more than $20 per month. The idea that someone would pay nearly $30 to make 18 overheads, on his own, amazed them. I later found out that many of the professors also drove taxis on nights and weekends, since they could make a month’s salary in tips in a couple of days.   While you need a visa to get into Cuba, you may as well leave your Mastercard on your dresser at home. Cubans take plastic, but they cannot accept cards issued by U.S. banks (because of the U.S. law). So Americans have to use currency. This is less of a problem than you’d think, because the currency everyone uses is American dollars. In fact, Cuba is one of the most dollarized economies in the world, and has been for more than a decade. If you try to change dollars for pesos, people look at you like you’re crazy, or American. About the only thing pesos will buy, from the “state” stores, is dead flies and old soap powder solidified into bricks.

      Lots of posts on moral subjectivsm and related topics at  urlLink Catallarchy  ( urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here , reversed chronology). I want to point to this paper by  urlLink Niclas Berggren ,   urlLink Does Belief in Ethical Subjectivism Pose a Challenge to Classical Liberalism?      Abstract:  Classical liberalism stresses the desirability of free markets, limited government and the rule of law. As such, it builds on some moral judgments. According to ethical objectivism, such judgments (in themselves always personal and subjective) can be true or false since objective moral facts exist against which the judgments can be assessed. Ethical subjectivism denies the existence of objective moral facts. This paper asks: Does it matter whether people believe that objective moral facts exist – in general and for a defense of classical liberalism? It is argued that the answer is in the negative. The implication for classical liberal strategy is that attempts to argue that a certain metaethical foundation is needed should be abandoned.

       urlLink Daniel Drezner  points to  urlLink this article  in  urlLink the Economist . The article reports on, among other things, philanthropy research made by  urlLink The Center for Civil Society Studies  at  urlLink Johns Hopkins University . According to a graph in the article (graph number 2), Sweden is number two among the studied countries, just behind Netherlands, when it comes to private philanthropy.  I guess that the Swedish estimate comes from an economist at the  urlLink Stockholm School of Economics , Filip Wijkström. I know that he is doing  urlLink research on the nonprofit sector  and that he has published a book,  urlLink The nonprofit sector in Sweden , in the  urlLink Johns Hopkins Nonprofit Sector Series . The estimate as such, 4% of GDP, is more or less the same  urlLink reported by Wijkström (Swedish only).  I don't doubt that estimate as such, it is probably accurate. What I want to do is to draw a picture of the Swedish nonprofit sector. The text that describes graph 2 says private philanthropy, but I’m not entirely sure that such a description is accurate in the Swedish context.  There are two main types of nonprofit organizations in Sweden, associations and foundations. The associations can be divided into five different types:  1) Recreational and service associations 2) Associations with social or ideological objectives 3) Economic or cooperative associations 4) Business associations 5) Labor-market associations  The most common kind of associations within the first group is sports-related. But there are also other kinds, such as minority organizations, associations furthering the arts, science, outdoor activities (scouting, tourism, etc.) and hobbies.  Groups that protect and preserve the environment belong to the second group. One will also find associations representing handicapped and disabled as well as political parties, various human right associations, associations that provide relief and development assistance and religious congregations.  The third group contains different kinds of cooperatives. Not just consumer and producer cooperatives but also associations who own and take care of common ground or roads. These roads are mostly small and situated on the countryside. The fourth group also contains cooperatives, but these business associations are not nonprofit.  Both trade unions and employer associations belong to the fifth group, labor-market associations.  Lundström and Wijkström (1995) exclude the fourth group from the nonprofit sector. They also exclude some of the associations in the third group, those with profit distribution. So called neo-cooperatives on the other hand belongs the nonprofit sector. One kind of neo-cooperatives is child care centers, established and run by parents.  They also include some of the labor-market associations, at least the labor movement and their educational associations, and private foundations that provide public service. Lundström and Wijkström want to exclude some parts of the Swedish Church with the argument that it is a state church. That was the case in 1995 but church and state was separated in the year 2000.  In Sweden, 90 percent of the population aged between 16 and 84 is a member of one association or more. The most common association is trade unions, 80 percent of the population is member in the union. Pensioner organisations are second with 42 percent and sports-related associations are third with 31 percent (note that those under 16 isn’t accounted for and the membership rate is probably higher. According to the Swedish Sports Confederation, more than 3 million is a member of a sports association).  It is here, I think; that the problem with the graph arises. As I said above, the graph says “private philanthropy”. The question is if one should regard the kind of associations that is most common as philanthropic associations. I have to say no to that question. The trade unions act on the behalf of their members. So does the pensioner organisations. The action of the sports clubs is the sport itself. The fourth largest kinds of association, the consumer-cooperatives, also act on the behalf of their members.  Granted, some of (and when it comes to trade unions, most of) this associations I have just mentioned do perform activities that should be regarded as philanthropic. But those activities are not the main objective of the different associations.  Also, the associations, and membership in them, might lead to good consequences for the society as a whole. Robert Putnam’s theory of social capital is one example on how it might work. But those consequences are unintended consequences and should not be confused with the intended.  So where can one find the philanthropic associations on the list? Well perhaps one can see culture organisations as philanthropic. 11 percent of the population is a member of such associations. But they are not necessarily philanthropic; some of them also act on the behalf of their member.  Next on the list with 8 percent is humanitarian organisation, and it is probably the largest group of the true philanthropic associations. Second on that list are environmental organisations with 4 percent.  Now, as I mentioned above, some of the non-philanthropic organisations do perform philanthropic activities so one can’t say that such activities are limited to the humanitarian, environmental and other organisations in the same “branch”. It’s hard to decide to which extent the associations in the nonprofit sector perform philanthropic activities. If one looks at how the sector use its money (about 60 billion SEK, 4 percent of GDP), one will find that somewhere between 7 and 35 percent* is used on “leisure and culture”, “social care” and “others”** and it is a very rough estimate. Some of these areas are only partly related to philanthropy, which means that the estimate as such is quite poor.  One interesting fact though is that only 30 percent of the money comes from the government, which is more or less the same as in the United States. The difference is that Sweden has a higher share of self-generated (for example, member fees and lotteries) where the US nonprofit sector relies more on gifts.  Another problem here is that the graph in the Economist is based on voluntary work and not how the money is spent. A study conducted by Filip Wijkström ten years ago might help us on that issue. Wijkström asked 5200 different organisations and one result that the survey gave us was that the nonprofit sector provides 480 million hours of voluntary work during one year. That is equivalent to 300 000 full-time jobs.  Wijkström’s study gives information on how that time is being used as well. The result is that the areas health care, social care, education, aid and peace and environment sum up to 13 percent of all the voluntary work provided by the nonprofit sector. One concern is that membership in associations which deal primarily with such activities has changed during the last ten years. For instance, membership in environmental organisations has decreased by 3-4 percentage points while the membership in humanitarian organisations has increased by 4-5 percentage points. But one might expect, and it is also confirmed by a study conducted by Statistics Sweden (SCB), that those leaving are the “passive” members and not the “active”.  The point of all this is that while the nonprofit sector in Sweden is quite large, emphasize is not on providing services as it might be in other countries. Lundström and Wijkström (1995, p. 1) write:  “There is substantial empirical evidence that the Scandinavian nonprofit sector has had a considerable impact on society during the 20th century, and that it evolved consistently with the welfare state, rather than in opposition to or instead of it. In contrast to other countries, however, the Swedish nonprofit sector developed less in the fields of health and social services, and more in the areas of culture, leisure, and advocacy.”  One can perhaps argue that while the welfare state hasn’t crowded out the nonprofit sector as such, it has crowded out health and social services from that particular sector. Whether or not that is the case, it looks like that the nonprofit sector is a poor proxy for private philanthropy in Sweden.  * Unfortunately, all these numbers are quite old, from 1992. ** “Others” contains “international activities”, “religion”, “health care”, “philanthropy”, “environmental” and yet another post “others”. What philanthropy in this context means is not specified, but I think it’s fair to say that some of the other areas I mention here should be regarded as philanthropy as well.
