      Hmmmm today was gay. Alex's scandalous ass left me at home all day to do absolutely nothing. She was suppose to come over at 4 and never called until 9:30 saying she hadda go to a funeral that she didn't no about. Oh well, yesterday was gay to. I helped Alex sell her fundraiser thingy for Cheerleading because her momma won't pay for it. But anyways we stopped by this boy Al's house, Brandon and Terrence were over there. Terrence kept on telling me that he wanted me to come downstairs to have some fun because he hadda hard baseball game and needed to have fun. I really didn't wanna stay so I told Alex that we needa leave. We left and went back over there an hour later. I really didn't wanna go over but I did because she gotta crush on Brandon. We go over there and are sitting in the basement and Terrence just keeps on talking to me. I'm trying to ignore him but he just keeps on talking. So he's like you gotta pretty face, you got pretty hair and then says you wanna go in the other room and talk? I say no we can talk right here. So he hadda ask me at least 20 times and I kept on saying no. I finally went back there and he just kept on asking the same thing over and over, can he get any play. I said no over and over until I just got tired of it and left. Right when I walked out the room I told Alex we needed to go so we left. We left there at 9 got back at her house about 9:15. We're sitting in the driveway and we see Felix running home. Earlier he had his little Moped thingy riding around. He runs inside and all of sudden everyone comes running out, Man, Man's sister, Man's gf, Felix, and John get in the car and go around there corner. I bet one of the boys took Felix's moped because like 15 mins later he came back with it and everyone else came back. but oh well, haven't really talked to John, haven't even seen him today and he didn't call last night so I dunno. Yesterday when they were all hoppin in the car I said John he looked over and then just got in the car. I dunno he's an idiot but anyways I'm bout to go watch Forest Gump with my sister.

      Today, nothing really good happened. Woke up at 2:30, got up and started cleaning so I can get some money. Momma got home at like 3, screaming for no reason like always. Yesterday I had dropped off some film at Walgreens, and today at like 5 I called and I asked if my film was ready and they said umm no its not you got the wrong Walgreens and then hung up. What the hell? I dropped off at the right place yesterday and I no I had the right number!! Alex called at 5:30 and I told her about it and she said well lets just walk up there. So I left at about 6 and we went up there. We get up there and theres 2 guys at the photo thingy. One of the guys was the one I gave my film to and the other was some different man. I said are my pictures done? He said no you called earlier we dont have your pictures. I said wtf I just dropped it off to him yesterday. The man was like yes she dropped em off. So they're searching for film and they find it, they got the pictures done but they put em on the photo cd yet, they say come back in a hour we'll have it ready. So me & alex leave and go back to her house and just sit there until 8. We finally got my pictures when we drove up to Walgreens. Never taking my film to Walgreens again! Schnucks > Walgreens. Didn't talk to John until about 8:40. Aaron called at about 8:30 asking me to take him to work at 9. When I was on the phone with Aaron, Alex called asking me if she could take me to get some fundraiser thingy. I get off the phone with both of em and John calls me and says he'll call me back when I get home. So by the time im set I got Aaron, Alex & Sterling in the car. I drop off Aaron at work and I cant take Alex because my car starts smoking. So I drop off Alex at home and about 2 houses down I drop off Sterling. What I didn't no was that John was at the same house. Sterling gets out and John comes up to the window and asks me where I'm about to go? I say im going home are you gonna call me? He said I dunno if you acting right. I said wtf did I do? I am acting right! I said call me in like 10 mins. He said if you acting right. I said whatever and drove off. He never called. I walked back up to Alex's at 9:30 and he was outside. He didn't say anything to me and saw me. So right now he's acting like a bitch and I dunno why. Boys these days are retarded assholes. He'll get some words tomorrow, if he calls. He aint nothin but a bum anyways.

      Today is so damn boring, there ain't nothing to do in St. Louis. I like it here and the people but...so boring. I've always said I'm always gonna stay here but now that I think about it, theres nothing here. I only wanna stay here because of friends, not family just my friends. I did absolutely nothing today, John called last night at like 12 and we talked for like 30 mins. He was suppose to call at 12 today but didn't call till 2:30. I drove up to Alex's to go get here and we left to go up to walgreens. I got some film and took some pictures to put on here. Already took the film up there to get developed so hopefully I'll have em soon. But after we got back from walgreens we just sat around on the porch until John came over to Man's house. It still was boring, Me & Alex went down there and he wasn't even talkin about nothing so we left. And now I'm home, doing absolutely nothing. Ain't nobody at home, Michelle, Aaron, Sterling, Travis, Lasha, Mario, Bryan, Amy, .. dunno where any of em are. Cell phone ain't on so they can't call me :(

      Wellll I always see someone with some kinda little posty thing to post there thoughts so I decided to make my own. Not to thrilled about others reading my thoughts but ill get over it but anyways I guess Ill talk about what I did today. Ummm this morning I woke up and just sat around until 3 and then went and got my haircut really short! Not that short but short for me. Around 6 Alex called me and told me to come over so I walked up there and we just sat on the porch. After like 5 mins I see an ambulance down the street taking someone out the house on a stretcher so I went and sat in the street just watching. Right across the street was Man, Felix, & some body I dunno named John playing basketball. Felix kept on telling me to come over there but I was to interested in the ambulance I acted like I didn't hear em. Then John said "Hey Rolleen come here!" What the fuck? Rolleen? No no no it's Colleen. I just ignored em and walked back up to the porch and right when I sat down Alex came out the house and said we're leaving. So we were on our way to Michelle/Aaron's house. We hadda walk past Man, Felix, & John in order to get there. So we were walking and John stopped us and asked me what my name was. At this point im still trying to look at the ambulance so most the stuff he says I'm saying huh? or what did you just say? But he asks me how old I am then asks for my #. He wasn't ugly so I gave it to em. Not that big of an age difference. He's 20 and I'm bout to be 17. After that we went to Michelle/Aaron's house. We get over there and I find out that Aaron ran away. Now Aaron... I've known that boy since 8th grade me and him are so close. We've liked each other since 8th grade but we've never done anything about it. I care about him so much, I would think he would call me and be like Colleen I'm alright. He knows I'll do anything for him. Just thinking of where he is makes it even worse, especially if he's with Sterling. I can't really get pissed if he's with a girl cause he's not my boyfriend. Usually I'd be jealous but I dunno why but im not. I just no that me and Aaron got something. I no we will never be bf/gf and I don't want to because we have the BEST friendship. I no if I don't getta phone call he gonna be going through hell once I see him.
