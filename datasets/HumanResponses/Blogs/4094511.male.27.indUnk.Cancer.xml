       Tonight I posted a new poem on  urlLink everypoet.com  in their  urlLink poetry showcase . I parade my verse around on this site quite often. Tonight I posted a poem that was inspired by one of the hundreds of people who submit poems to the site's archive quite regularly. The pen name she uses is    urlLink MyQuill4U (view her poetry list).

						   There are funnier things in life than those that last comics stand with. The real joke of living, is getting along. Rodney King, is not my hero, as so I hope he is not yours. His message, however a ringing bell in the backs of our ears, just behind the eardrum. The bell begins to take shape at birth, and eventually in life, as the Liberty Bell it cracks. Why can't we all just get along? Honestly, why?  I am not a genius, though my IQ argues this with me. Not that, yet also not a moron. Yes, I claim to be a fool, but that is a birth right. I can easily see why we do not get along, will not get along, and cannot get along. We have different ideas of love, religion, philosophy, art, entertainment, and even pet peeves o'plenty. This in itself is not such a bad thing. It creates our diversity, which in many ways simply just makes life all the more interesting. We, however feel this blustering, ecumenical need to trample, crucify, and destroy the feelings of others.  Scenario: You think that love does not exist. You want to live you life and bed whomever, whenever, no strings attached. This does not give you the right to approach in desire to obstruct the life of someone who believes in love, and is in love. That being said, you figure that everybody should feel as you do towards the idea of love, so in turn you are doing this "lover" a favor by destroying his hopes. You spoon feed your conscious on empty words from a bad episode on Beverly Hills 90210, or some sleazy soap opera. Well, maybe is life were rehearsed, edited, shot for time, and scored you would be doing us a favor. Ultimately, however life is not a movie. If it were, might not you be the villain? Do you like being the villain? Have you always had fantasies about being Bluto when Popeye never finds Spinach? Does this entertain you? Do you need to create a website, where you bed wed mothers? Is that hour (if you are lucky) of pleasure which is not supreme to the million other hours you have done this, worth crushing the spirit of some young husband, who would be a better husband has his wife not read a Harlequin Romance novel and could not measure him to Bartholomew David Anglosberg (the stud from the book). Do you even know what the word Harlequin means? With Webster, and Doubleday by my side I certainly do. Harlequins are clowns, or buffoons. Your assumption has surely made a harlequin out of you.  Another scenario: I personally find atheism to be a very inarticulate, unlearned, lazy, and egotistical way to believe. I am a Christian. If I tell you that your beliefs make you a buffoon (there is that word again), I will be strung up to the proverb's post and burned like Joan of Arc. Though, you personally as a "non-conformist" (also known as someone who conformed to nonconformity which basically makes you conform anyway...hmmmm), decide that any faith is a joke. You find it amusing to trample persons of faith with your uneducated and Xeroxed approved rhetoric. This time however I am a villain, because you are speaking with a unique tongue (or so society would proclaim). Unique, give me a break, most of the atheist approach is an overused series of arguments formed by people who's knowledge then, would make yours now, look as if it couldn't fill a hollow water melon seed.  Then there is abortion, cloning, gun control, death penalty, and several other life philosophies. On each side of each argument are more uneducated esteem juiced beef cakes to make the head's head explode. We call people on the opposite side of us ignorant. Yet, the very definition of ignorance is a condition of misinformation. In this case I have to ask.....How does one know which is being played. We all come to our conclusions based on the knowledge we have. Who is to say which knowledge is truth? Couldn't we all be brainwashed to some degree? If one man reads ten books nine of which are fictional, and another reads one book of nonfiction, which man is more informed? Think about that. A degree from Yale, could ultimately be a degree of dung that money has made into fertilizer. Therefore a degree from Crustation Corner High School, may be fertilizer, though people keeping stepping in it, and calling it dung.  Ultimately in everything all we really have to go on in all opinions, beliefs, and ways of life , is faith. Faith is all we have. Face it, we may all be fool of dung, our faith is what fertilizes us and makes us grow. So in this, should we not respect the faiths of others, and discuss our differences, yet tread lighter on theirs.

						   My first blog. I am not sure exactly how to do this, so I am going to try and wing it. The Replacements sing "Bastards of Young" and Jack Kerouac wants me to sell my rug. Life is grand, the fool is galloping through a life, where his debts are yet repaid.  I had a conversation with a man today. We both spoke the universal language of beauty. He asked me how my love life was, and I told him of my gorgeous treasure. I asked him of his, and he told me of a gorgeous diamond. Jaded, as I usually am it was today that I understood, all me are struck by beauty. While beauty comes in many different shapes and sizes, and is truly in the eyes of the beholder...the beheld are almost gods or goddesses (depending of your preference) to our small worlds. Which leads me to another point, it's really not a small world after all. The world is only small when we make it so. When we surround ourselves with beauty, love, laughter, fresh air, and hints of God, the world is huge. The air is so abundant that we can't breathe enough. The trees are so green that they take on an unnamed color. The sky is so blue, that heaven seems to be a calm and peaceful ocean, that we all dare sail.  We are the sons of no one? Not quite, we are the sons of this world, its creator, and even its bad seed. However, we are bastards of young. Fatherless to the thought of aging. For life is indeed eternal, even to the atheist.   (Site Update)  DanielBamberg.com is currently being hosted on Angelfire. Until I am set on the design and the basic ingredients of the site I am not placing it on my own domain. If you were to visit the site now, you will notice there is not a lot going on. I hope that within a few weeks the site will be seventy five percent operational. I am not sure the cards will be dealt so fairly, but I am banking on it. I hope you all visit frequently, and enjoy. I also ask any new comers to REVOLUTION NOW (The Scarecrowman's Harvest) to not take anything too seriously. While most of my columns are very serious, read more than just those columns. This blog, my poetry, and other areas of that site, will reveal I am more complex than black and white. While I may present myself as black on one issue, and white on another, I am gray on most issues. I also have a sense of humor about most things, so I ask that you display yours as well, even when you disagree.  (New Column)  Reinventing The Fool, my new Autobiographical ongoing column/story/poem will be debuting on Salty Ham on August 10th. I have already posted a introductory first section in their "Life" area. If you miss it, do not worry. I will be posting that along with my first official posting all at once, giving you another opportunity.     TODAY'S TOP FIVE     the top five songs for creating your first blog!  1 Bastards Of Young - The Replacements  2 Chances Are - Bob Marley  3 Cry Mississippi - Helicopter Girl  4 Lullaby - Jim Chappel  5 Smokestack Lightin' - Howlin Wolf    scurry on now!
