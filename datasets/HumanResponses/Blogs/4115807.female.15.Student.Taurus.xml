       Im just a loser and i've gotta realize it... i really just want to see ashliegh happy... at least one of us and i choose her, im already adapted to this lifestyle and ive already dug my own grave at least she has a chance to be happy and have a normal lifestyle. as for me im already fucked up half of u ppl don't know half the shit ive been threw or y im like this today. its one big ball of hate and disrespect and pain... i dont want to have to see ashliegh go threw the shit i  had to but i cant stop her and it sucks it sucks so fucking much i wanna make sure she is alright and make sure she's happy and be there for her when she needs me but sometimes i cant even be there for myself when i need it... god i just want to cry and cry and cry it really affects me that i cant do anything!  :'( i gtg now bye

        we got back from registration a little bit ago and it was really really hot. i got all my stuff and all my stupid books and uniform but then i got my lock..oh man i almost broke the locker open cuz i couldnt get the lock to work it was pissing me off but who cares i did it anyways... hmmm it just rained but like for 2 minutes then stopped. OMg last night around 3-4 am i heard this loud BOOM! and then all the electricity went out, including the air conditioning.. so there i was dieing of heat while my dad tried to figure out what happened he said something about a generator or whatever. it knocked the whole block out. then i couldnt go to sleep cuz we lit candles and im deathly afraid of fire so i had to wait till 5:10 ish when the sun rised to go to sleep so i could blow out the candles them i had to wake up at 8!! and i didnt leave the house untill 11 but anywasy hmm well here is my schedule...

      So far my day has been nice, considering I just woke up 5 minutes ago. I really don't have much to say; I never do. Hmmm... What to tell... Well, my parents don't know yet which is cool, ummm my life is kinda(as ashleigh would say) Blah right now. It's just so stupid that whatever we(teenagers) do, they(the parents/teachers) think it's for attention or that we have some major problem and that medication is going to fix it. Grrr!!!! I hate this...Bye

       Kiki made a BIG uhoh... I'm so stupid, I wish I wasn't so dumb and such a loser. But whatever. I just got back from Ashleigh's house; we hung out and chilled which is cool cuz I'm really not the 'OMG! Let's go to the mall' type . I'm more of an 'oh okay, sure let's just chill.' SO, we(me ashleigh, scott, and ashleigh's lil' bro) went to Larkspur and chilled there. Scott hates me though which is fine but he doesn't have to make it so apparent, but it's fine. I am SO SO SO UBER stressed about school I hate it, I wish it was just an option that we could choose to go or not to. Hmmm... Well, I gtg my mother is getting suspicious. tty'all later lyl bye
