						   How Many Friends?The old man turned to me and asked"How many friends have you?"Why 10 or 20 friends have I,And named off just a few ~ He rose quite slow with effortAnd sadly shook his head" A lucky child you areTo have so many friends," he said,But think of what you're sayingThere is so much you do not knowA friend is just not someoneTo whom you say "Hello" A friends a tender shoulderOn which to softly cryA well to pour your troubles downAnd raise your spirits high A friend is a hand to pull you upFrom darkness and despair...When all your other "so called" friendsHave helped to put you there A true friend is an allyWho can't be moved or boughtA voice to keep your name aliveWhen others have forgot But most of all a friend is a heartA strong and sturdy wallFor from the hearts of friendsThere comes the greatest love of all!!! So think of what I've spokenFor every word is trueAnd answer once again my childHow many friends have you?? And then he stood and faced meAwaiting my replySoftly I answered"If lucky......one have "I" "You!!!!"
