      Powerslave - Iron Maiden   Review   This is one of the most prominent albums of Iron Maidens carrer, originally released in 1984, and recently digitally remastered, it draws inspiration from the lore of ancient Egypt. The album opens with "Aces High", a song about World War II RAF pilots. It is probably one of the best songs ever written with complex harmonies and sophisticated lyrics and riffs. The next song is "2 Minutes to Midnight," which is probably the single most popular Maiden song ever released. Accordingly, it is the only song that ever recieved any significant radio airplay, and was even included in the popular game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. This song tells of the evils of war, politicians, and secret societies. Its lyrics are very sophisticated with much hidden meaning. "Lofser Words (Big Orra)" is one of those rare Maiden instrumental songs and has some great power ballads. "Flash of the Blade" is a great Maiden classic, with fast riffs, and a great beat to headbang to. "The Duellists" is a largely overlooked Iron Maiden song, largely due to the fact that it is similar in lyrical content to Flash of the Blade, which is much more meaningful than this counterpart. "Back in the Village" has a catchy beat but gets on your nerves very fast due to the overall simplicity of the lyrics, and therefore is not one of maiden's best. "Powerslave" the title song is an awesome display of raw metal power by Maiden, its lightning fast riffs and Eastern like sound engulf you, along with masterful use of the whammy bar by the 3 guitarists (Adrian Smith, Dave Murray, Janick Gers). Steve Harrison's bass picking fits in perfectly with the lyrical content of the song, and provides a stable backdrop to all of the songs. This is truly one of the best Maiden songs. "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is based on a poem by Samuel Taylor Colderidge, and is about 20 minutes long, this is truly a Maiden legacy, the lyrics tell the story well, the guitar work is amazing, this song can be listened to over and over, without getting tired of it.  Overall, this is one of Maidens best albums, and was a top ten hit even though it had practically nonexistant radio airplay. This album is a must have for any Metal library. The digitally remastered version contains original album art, Music Videos of "2 Minutes to Midnight" and "Aces High" in rather good quicktime format, band bios, and other interesting maiden info. This album is well worth the $20 price tag.  -Ilya Rabkin
