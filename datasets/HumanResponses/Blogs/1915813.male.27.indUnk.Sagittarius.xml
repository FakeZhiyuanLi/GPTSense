      They try to sell  urlLink Dodgeball  as a Zoolander sequal. Not quite, and not that I was looking for this.  I was glad that Ben Stiller was the only migration and only took up at most a quarter of the movie.  Bunch of over-the-top physical comedy that I might have enjoyed more if I was expecting it.  My introduction to Vince Vaughn was some Mob comedy of errors that I couldn't make it through. This move redeemed him for me.    Cameo's were cool. Especially Lance Armstrong.    urlLink Alan Tudyc  rocked. They should've let him have more comedy. Garrrr  Ending was an ending and then >>BWACK 3.25 twinkly starlighty thingies. (5's the most, right?)  No sequel's necessary.

      Saw this one at the outdoor despite hearing of horrid reviews, one of which was "You'll yearn for The Cat in the Hat". The movie certainly wasn't excellent, rather hurried and missing something, but I was NOT yearning for The Cat.  The cast assignment seemed appropriate.  Bill Murray can't quite shine as he does in person.  They worked very hard to get tons of the comic strip story factors into the movie, while actually giving a different perspective on a few of the more consistently depressing ones. Imagine a Peanuts movie where Chuck actually get's to kick the football, or throw a no-hitter, and he actually get's to second base. Don't expect Garfield to shine as any character example for your kids...somehow I kept imagining him as an example of those capitalism rationalizations (You know "selfishness can be good..") which just didn't click with how I want my kids to treat there siblings.  Wait for the $1 rental, then enjoy it with kids or your sister who collected all those rectangular Garfield comic strips.

        Here's  urlLink Ben Stiller  and  urlLink Jennifer Aniston  in a (supposedly romantic) comedy. Sounds great since Ben Stiller has pretty damn good track record with the last few movies he's made and Jennifer Aniston was in  urlLink Office Space  so she gets a thumbs up, too. Apparently when you put the two together you make steaming pile of crap.   Yes, this movie sucked. I really wanted to like it, even just a little bit (well, I guess the ferret was pretty funny, but animals are cute no matter what they do), but I couldn't find anything all that entertaining about this movie. I actually couldn't wait for it to finish. The plot was thin and really didn't feel cohesive at all. It was just a bunch of...stuff thown together that resembles a movie because it deals with the same two characters for over an hour. I blame the writer (whom I believe was also the director) for this totally sloppy mess. He does get one redemtion point, although this is only because he's a first time director.  I don't know what else to comment on this one. Don't buy it or spend money on the rental, just borrow it from a friend who foolishly rented it or bought it if you have like a month with absolutely nothing to do ahead of you. If you really like Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, go rent  urlLink Meet the Parents  and Office Space instead.

        Ok, is it an  urlLink Adam Sandler  movie or is it a  urlLink Drew Barrymore  movie? Well, it's both. You get the fun and humor of a good Sandler movie mixed with the romantic 'chick flick' side that Drew brings to the screen. Basically, if you like  urlLink The Wedding Singer , you'll like this movie, too.   Quick plot summary :  urlLink Groundhog Day  in Hawaii.   Not as quick plot summary : Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is afraid of attachment. He only dates women on vacation to Hawaii so he can easily avoid having a long term relationship. This all changes the moment he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) and falls in love. One small problem though; Lucy was in a car accident a year ago and only retains her memory for 24 hour periods, forgetting everything that happens the previous day. After discoving her condition, Henry does what any guy would do when in love with a girl with no short term memory. He spends each day making her fall back in love with him all over again.  Sandler is back in good form again after putting out a few duds. He movie buddy,  urlLink Rob Schneider , plays a pretty big role in the movie and is really quite toned down for those of you who can't stand him being over-the-top wacky. There's also quite a few references to Sandler's other films if you watch close enough. Drew is cuter and cuter in each new movie I see her in, including this one. And really Drew and Sandler work well and look natural together on screen. And luckily there is chemistry between them on screen or else this movie would have been shite.  The biggest gripe I had about the film was that the ending was crap. Other than that, I really didn't have much to nitpick on. I actually like watching these romantic comedies (or 'chick flicks' if that's an actual genre yet) unlike most guys I know, or else I probably would have bitched about the inevitable emotional/romantic parts of the film.  Alas, if you don't care for romantic comedies, but like a good Adam Sandler film...I'd have to say just watch the damn thing.  If we had some funky 5 star rating system, I'd give it around 3 3/4 stars.

      Somebody who was more impressed with the movie and could look beyond the stereotypes should post a review here:  -- Insert Review Here --  But I found  urlLink this  quite amusing.  I found " urlLink Wasabi " quite entertaining and humourous, especially with redundant sub-titles.  I can never remember the name, as I can usually get hung up on  urlLink Wabi-Sabi .

      "It's the bloodiest most violent film in ages."  That was a stupid excuse for me to put of seeing this movie for so long and miss the big-screen psyche gripping potpourri of 30 years of movie entertainment excellence Terantino can collage.  The 70's attributes were just plain fun. Mixing anime and silly horror gags to tune the tone of a movie's "hot media" was well appreciated.  I usually don't see a movie to experience a particular scenario, but I'm inquisitive and want to know the dry facts, especially character shaping ones. Great presentation. (Although the scalping should have been on an angle.)  Lucy Liu may be pretty and her features fit the character and all, but her presence is not compelling.  Model actress go home. The table-top speech might as well have been followed up with a gag-inducing "You go girl!"  Meanwhile average featured Uma radiates the sexyness that comes from a woman admired.  One has no evidence whether she could be the fawning, adoring, head on your shoulder companion, but you feel it and attribute it blindly.  I'm looking forward to the next one.

      Artsy movie with a list of known but rarely anticipated actors. Enough to push me to rent it on top of the odd storyline: Get outta dodge, the city's becoming a dammed reserviour.   I thought I would fall asleep. I didn't. I was intrigued, potentially mezmorized, and amused as gently double-take moments.  There is one odd fairly disturbing part, but when the man takes his arms off the moose head the scene is just about over.  Excellent movie for organizing photos or playing cards by. - d.g

      A friend picked up the movie Zulu at Walgreens in a $4 bin so I wasn't expecting much.  Heralds from the late 60's maybe early 70's (imdb could tell me but I'm lazy right now).  Most of the movie is action scenes of Zulu warriors charging a small number of British soldiers stationed at a hospital in the middle of nowhere, Africa.  That's basically the plot.  Pretty good if you're into historical stuff, it's based on a true story.  Apparently other versions of the same movie exist, they may be better.

      Entertaining movie, but not much else. Wasn't worth the $$ to see it opening day. Annoying guy was annoying, and Bean wasn't as 9-year oldish as he was in the TV series.  Buy/Rent the series instead, and rent the movie when you can get it for a buck, and watch it while eating or assembling particle board furniture.  I haven't seen Bean the cartoon.  Of course my toddlers loved it, as they did the series, but wouldn't putting a physical comic into the plastic medium of physical comedy sort of mask out the humor?   Would a Monty Python cartoon fly, even if Pixar did it?  Then again, John Cleese' voice talent has been so saturated the novelty might be gone before we noticed...  Better stop before I completely alienate MP fans.  Speaking of British Humor, looking forward to what Abe and TBD-monicker have to say about The Office.

       urlLink   Hellboy  is one fun movie.   I've been sorely dissappointed with most comic book to move flicks in the past (well, I consider Spiderman about as much of a comic as Superman: Supersaturated.)  This is one fits the bill through and through. From consistent action, sillyness, over the top necessities of a larger than life film, and even a satisfying ending.  Did I mention I liked the affects? The strong biblical and mythological references seemed a bit much, and Tam felt a lot of the action was cliche, but I didn't care.  I really liked that they kept in comic book factors such as "My kittens! Someone save them! ... they're all I have!"  I wonder if these comics are published only in comic books or graphic novels. As the IMDB review said, I'd like to find out more of the backstory.  I didn't care that the villain lady didn't get much air time. She was too obnoxious bad-ass for my tastes. I hope there's a sequel. Would it be good if it were done by Sam Raimi. This one is tight enough that it would be easy to screw up, but many of the hero characters seem solid, and another round of villains would be fun.  If I were a betting man I'd guess that they would pull a Highlander. Sucky sequal, decent III. By the time a TV series comes out there will be a completely brand new medium which will be well suited for a series. Maybe Terri Gilliam could pull it off. Hellboy: The road trip.  Hellboy: The `nam years.  Looking forward to what Abe has to say on this one. Think movie-nighters should escelate this one.

      Yep. Finally got under my bus last Friday. Cleaned off a bunch of grime and took pictures of parts that baffled me or I'd want an expert opinion on later. One of those parts was, as I learned looking it up in a book later, was a Thermostat. A thermostat on an Air-Cooled car?!? Apparently it opens an air vent to cool the oil. Mine is stuck "open", which means it takes longer to warm up my engine, which I learned from this  urlLink German Supply article , which notes that mine are no longer produced, but the beetle version can be modded to fit in mine. Small project #8.   Update:  Sometimes it feels like my life is a whacked-out movie review, other times I just mis-direct my blog entries. :-}  For the rest of you, a teaser:     Sometimes it makes you wish  urlLink your hand was simply a chainsaw.   (I do want to play that video game.)

       urlLink     Ok, there's is a ton of debate going on over how false or how true this documentary is. I have heard convincing arguments from both sides over a few of the topics covered in this documentary, but a lot of the "debunking" of facts within here this film end up with "That issue has never been proven one way or the other 100% so it's a lie." or elevates into personal attacks on Moore himself. These arguements are the majority which I have read against this film which makes me cringe. It makes me cringe knowing that there are people out there who blindly follow our leadership without questioning whether or not choices being made are good for all of us as a whole. But I regress...this is a film review, not a political debate.  This documentary is done very well. I have never watched  urlLink Roger & Me  or  urlLink Bowling For Columbine , but I will have to watch them now because this was brilliant. At one point, when first talking about the 9/11 attacks on the trade center, the screen goes black for what seems forever while all you hear is sirens and screams and explosions. I appreciate this because we all don't need to be fed that same footage that we have all seen over the last 3 years. We all know it by heart and even though the screen is blank, you know everyone in the audience is picturing the same thing you are. Except for that one kid that was sitting in front of me who kept looking back at the projector to see if there was something wrong with the film. The first half of the film goes over things such as the 2000 election, Bush's love of vacations, family ties to the Saudi royal family, various corporation links, and the "justification" for the war in Iraq. When we get to the second part of the film, we get a turn in style. The second half is mainly about the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mostly Iraq, though. We end up following a lady from Michigan as she vehemently defends her son joining the military and backing the war to her fullest, to learning of her sons death and eventually questioning why the nation's children are really over in Iraq dying. I guess you could say that it gets pretty emotional.  It's eye-opening, sad, funny, disturbing, and I'll even say it...very patriotic. It's patriotic because there's nothing wrong with questioning our government. That's what makes America great and that's what this country was founded on. And that's what this film does a great job of; questioning the current Bush administration's true intentions. If we didn't question our governments decisions, we might as well just have a dictatorship. Or maybe just have ruling control passed down through the Washington family tree like some kind of royal family, because why would we need to vote? As an aside; I highly doubt you'll ever see two similar reviews on this film. You take out of it what you will and everyone will take out something a little different then the next person.  Anyway, I give it a 4.5 thumbs up out of a possible 5 thumbs (and I'm still pissed that I decided to go see Spiderman 2 over this originally).

      Sometimes on the way home from work I catch Dave Berkman on NPR's  urlLink Media Talk .  I can't name another radio host I've ever heard to be entertaining, pallatable, and in such appropriately abrupt command as our pal Dave.  Today he had on a retired FCC chairman. They seemed to carry a harmony similar to Az and Crowley in  urlLink Good Omens . (Pardon me: HOLY CRAP  urlLink TERRY GILLIAM  IS DIRECTING  urlLink THE MOVIE !  He's informed, smart and frank enough to cut off blather and spotlight the next point of view with the abruptness and odd humor of a seen-it-all yet still cares mortician.  This  urlLink Shepherd-Express article  provides an example and rings near to my annoyance at traffic noises in radio ads.

       urlLink Scary Movie 3 (2003)  had a good preview. I think.  I saw half of Scary Movie 2 and thought this one might be an improvement, especially as I had seen both The Ring and Signs.  I wanted to fall asleep. Leslie Nielson was even in it, whom I find silly humor in, but I suppose they didn't have license to regurgitate the Police Squad gads. Maybe it's a fun group movie. Worked as entertainment while rocking a screaming toddler to sleep, but after the tick-and-tieing (sorry, bad accounting metaphor) the original and new movie cross references (that's the one I was looking for) for half the movie I was bored.  Damn that discount debit rental card blinding me into renting crap because I've already paid for it on discount.  One plus one burnt one of those cool expand bigger than a head pie tin stove top popcorn popping disposable things out of five. (but-not-worth-gratuitous-dashes)

         This is going to be a short and sweet review.  I thought the book sucked, so I was intrigued at how bad the movie was going to be. It's horrible. All the better parts from the book were totally cut from the movie and  urlLink Paul Walker  is one of the worst actors I have ever seen (never watched  urlLink 2 Fast 2 Furious , maybe that's his Monet on film).

        I'll just come right out and say that it was merely and OK movie. I really wanted to just go see a fun comic book flick and I ended up moaning over technicalities the whole time.   First of all, I want the guy/girl who edited this to never work in Hollywood again. It was absolutely horrible. Numerous times we were forced to watch a repetitive action that could have been cut down to a fraction of the time it was spent on screen. I mean, I get that Peter Parker is clumsy and that there are mops in the closet. I don't need a full minute of it for me to get that point. I also understand what an uncomfortable silence is without needing an unnecessarily long time to reinforce this point after the dialog was finished. I don't know how many scenes there were like this offhand, but there were enough that just pissed me off and ruin the flow of the movie. And the Mary Tyler Moore bit was stupid and again, unnecessarily long.  The CGI was ok, but I expected a little bit better effects than the first movie. There's something about the way the CGI looks in both Spider-Man movies that bothers me a little. And I've noticed it in some other movies, too. I refer to it as the "Spider-Man effect" I swear I can tell any movie that uses the same graphics house that they use for the Spider-Man films because it just has a funky plastic-y look to everything. Normally stuff like that doesn't bother me, but it's like when you first notice the boxes around the ships when watching the original Star Wars trilogy. After you get it pointed out and take notice of it, you can't keep from seeing it from then on out.  The dialog itself was pretty horrible. I could tell in a few scenes that the actors had to fight though chunky lines that just didn't flow or sound natural. Maybe the pauses in between lines weren't right, I don't know...it was crappy.  As for the good, well...I guess the special effects were pretty cool, but there really wasn't much until the second half of the film. The first half started reminding me of  urlLink The Matrix Reloaded  with all talk and no action. I mean, we all know who Spider-Man is now, we don't need to flesh out the damn characters. I want to see some Good vs. Evil action! Lots of explosions and stuff. With that said, this movie is a lot less action and a lot more "chick flick". Normally I don't mind this, but not when it's done out of place. This is a Spider-Man movie, not  urlLink Beaches  for crying out loud.  Ok, so this is more of a rant than a review, but I was let down. So, in our non-standardized rating system, I give Spider-Man 2 a  3 out of 5 shiny bottlecaps .   Oh yeah. Watch for Bruce Campbell and the Evil Dead references; the best parts of the movie (ok..next to Doc Oc).

      My wife and eldest went to see Brother Bear.  They weren't too impressed, except with Bob and Doug McEnzey as Moose.  When told the storyline I just about puked.  Disney is the perpetuator of minority religions. (Well, who knows about that Chinese movie...but I am surprised they didn't slip in an "we were seeded by aliens!" in the Hawaiin one. >:-( )  Anyway...as Strange Brew is my #7 movie of all time, I really wanted to see this, so grudgingly (post-purchase New Release surprise!) rented the Sing-Along video plastered with Brother Bear but Narrated by THE MOOSE! :-)  Tam said I was seeing the best part of the movie.  They were fun.  But there is something missing when they're not talking about Beer, Donuts and Hockey. *sigh* It was mostly "I can too dance, eh!" and "You're not not dumb!" stuff I wasn't sure I was happy to impress my boys with.  I'd rather they see Strange Brew.  Intoxins, hard hockey checks and all.  Why not to rent this movie: THEY PLAY IT IN TRIPLICATE!!! It's worse than teletubbies!! The first round is words on the bottom, second round is super-imposed dancing kids (having all I can do not to run to the toilet vomitting!) but the LAST version (after credits, *whew*!--turn off excuse) is just the music track and sing along words.  Did I mention I didn't like Phil Collins music and he's paying off his multi-million dollar mortgate waxing out cheesey feel good (because that's all that matters) Disney crap?

       urlLink     Ok, for those who really know me, they know that I love this movie more than anything else in the world. Ok, maybe not everything else, but I've loved this movie more than any other movie for the last few months and I don't think it'll be dropping in my charts anytime soon. This will be another short review only because you shouldn't be reading a review of a movie you should be watching right now because if you have so much free time to be reading crap like this... Anyway...  If you like Tarantino dialogue, then this is the movie for you. Not since Pulp Fiction has somebody (imagine that, same writer/director) created a movie that you can watch talking heads and not be bored off your ass. Not to say that Vol. 2 has tons of talking heads, but when it does, it's never boring. What's great about this film? 1) dialogue. 2) Uma. 3) Ending. 4) Uma. What's not great about this film. If you don't like Tarantino dialogue and only like the first volume because of the un-Tarantino like action, you will be very disappointed. Very.  For the rest of us, slap these two movies together just like the big 4 disc DVD set that will be coming out sometime this winter, and you'll be watching the very best of America cinema. Well, actually, the best of every kind of cinema.  In closing...Uma kicks ass, Tarantino dialogue kicks ass, I want a Hattori Hanzo sword (or Uma is she's free), and go watch this film. Actually go watch both volumes back to back like they should be watched.   And now wait patiently until Tarantino finally gets around to doing volume 3.  I give it an 8 out of 5 dwarf stars. If put together with the first volume, it gets 10 out of 5 dwarf stars.

      Ok, here's most likely my last post from here in Ireland. It's our last full day in Dublin and we spent all morning at the National Museum, which had quite a bit of pretty cool stuff to look at.  After a small lunch we set off to finish our shopping. I think we all pretty much had to buy an extra bag to haul the stuff back that we picked up here. I think I got most of mine stuffed into my big backpack and only had to pick up a small backpack to use as my new carry on bag for the flight back. Craig and Tim are taking a nap before we head out for our last night of pubbing here. It's going to be quite a change getting back to the usually half full bars where everything is usually bought in bottles for around 2 bucks. Now I'm use to drinking everything in pints and spending between 3.40 to 5 euro for a drink. And now I have a taste for darker stouts and ales so nights out in GB and Rapids are going to be a little more costly now, too. Still cheaper than her, though. Well, it's time for me to get cleaned up and ready to head out. I think it's around 6:30-7:00 pm here, so we'll be heading out in an hour. We'll see everyone back home either tomrrow night or by Monday at the latest...

      Yeah!! Back again for another update, on a cpu that is a crappy touchscreen that barely works and sucks down a Euro for every 15 minutes. So, to continue... We met up with a pretty good size group from out bus trip to grab a few pints saturday night, Tim, Craig and I went to a dance club later on that night after all the other's headed back to their hostels so we could find some foosball. The club we went to, I believe was called The Globe, cost 10 Euro just to friggin' get in. The music sucked and the foosball table that was suppose to be a Tornado table, which it was, actually looked more like an old dynamo table. Basically a piece of shit. So no more running around trying to find foosball. Sunday morning we met up with about 4 others from the bus ( Glenn, Tracy, Haley, and Nigel) to go through the Guinness tour. The tour itself was alright, nothing special except for the last stop at a bar at the top of their main building which held a bar and a complete 360 degree view of Dublin. I got a few pictures looking out and a small video panning across most of the city. We also got our free pint of Guinness before they sent us down to their gift shop which is the worst place to go after having a little alcohol in you, since everything they have their you basically want at least one of. After that, we ran to grab some lunch and then ran to a pub in Temple Bar to watch the Arsenal vs. Manchester U game (and a few more pints because that's just what you do here) we grabbed some dinner there and they started playing American football on their tvs, so we stayed there all night hoping that they would eventually play the Packer game, no luck. Although when the Arsenal/Man U game was on, the place was packed full, american football didn't seem to have a very big following at all.  Today we stopped at the art gallery and another museum that I can't remember the name of off hand, and then went to see Dublin Castle which was a  little bit of a let down, but ok for the price. After that we grabbed some dinner and now are headed back to the hostel for a quick nap and then most likely headed back out to the pubs. Really, after around 6pm there isn't much open around here besides the pubs so you're pretty much limited to going out and drinking. And we have yet to find a pub later at night that isn't full of people every night of the week. So, I'm off to nap. Tomorrow looks like it will just be a shopping day and a visit to the National Museum (which looks pretty damn cool). I may or may not update tomorrow depending on what's going on. Otherwise we'll be back home in two days. Later...

      ok, finally back to Dublin and back to internet access.We just finished out 6 day tour and it was a great time. Only had 2 days of rain, the rest of the trip was great weather. To quickly summarize what I couldn't fill in for the last 4 days, we went along the west coast all day wed. Stopped at a beach (a little too windy though), went through an area of purely rock mountains called the Burreen and saw the Cliffs of Moher. The cliffs were absolutly amazing. The only bad part, quite horrible actually, was the weather was absolutely crappy. There was rain and strong winds and lots of fog at the cliffs. The only way we could get good picture was by sitting right on the edge and taking a picture down below by the ocean. It pretty much reminded me of looking over the edge of the grand canyon, except there was the Atlantic Ocean below instead of rocks. We stayed the night in Doolin, a very small town with the only business' being a few B&Bs, hostels, and 3 pubs. Thursday was spent going through the Dingle Peninsula which was also beautiful except for the rain and wind. We have a few good shots on the farthest west point of the island while out there. We also saw the beach that was used for the famous Planet of the Apes shot. We ended up spending that night in Killarney and once again went pubbing all night.  Friday we were at the Blarney Castle and got our kisses in on the good ol' Blarney stone. We also stopped at a pretty nice castle called the Rock of Cashel. That night was spent in Killkenny, the All-Irish National Hurling Champions are from there, so naturally I had to get a jersey to show my support. Once again, more pubbing. I also have my new favorite beer, Smithwick's, which is brewed right in Killkenny along with none other than Budweiser. Today we stopped at a smaller fortress called the Rock of Dunamase, drove through Wicklow, which has beautiful mountains surrounding a small monastic city (pretty cool except for more rain) and then headed back to Dublin.  So that's the last 4 days wrapped up really quickly. Tonight we plan to meet up with the others from our bus tour for a few pints before every one heads out to where ever they are headed to next. I think we may plan a one day trip to northern out of time.

      Ok, I'm finally making it back to an Internet station. We're on our second day of our bus trip and have driven from Dublin to the west coast already. Yesterday we stopped to see a holy shrine which I can't remember the name of offhand, but it was in the town of Knock I believe. Anyway, this was suppose to be a place where some people saw a vision of the Virgin Mary and some other biblical figures. Much later, the Pope declared it as a certain type of holy spot of such that only 4 exist in all Europe. There was also a nice number of shops nearby selling a bunch of crap so mostly likely, elderly people will spend all their money on glow-in-the-dark Mary statues (made in China). So from there we went a little further west and ended up in a town on the coast line. A group of us set up to walk about 25 minutes from our hostel down to the bay nearby (which eventually empties into the Atlantic ocean). We sat down there and had a few pints before heading back into town and and stopping at a local pub with most of the other people on our trip. Of course, after a few pints of Guinness, Craig managed to start bitching about how great Budweiser is even compared to Guinness. This morning we stopped at another site on the coast where pilgrims come every St. Patricks Day to climb up a mountain where there now stands a church. The climb was way too high to make it to the very top (we have lots of pictures) and I only went about half the way Tim and Craig climbed, which was still quite a hike. Looking down off the side of the mountain you could get a great view of the harbor and some of the islands. From there we stopped in a small area that is known as Ireland's only fjord. This was just a few buildings around the corner of an ocean inlet surrounded by mountains (thus fjord). Very beautiful. We then stopped here and there at a few more small picture taking spots and now have ended up in Galway. Galway is basically a college city, third largest to Dublin. We're getting ready to eat dinner and then we'll be heading out to some nightclubs here for some pints and dancing. This should be quite different from the pubs we have been hitting lately where it'm mostly just live Irish music (which is also very nice). So that's about where we are now. No one has drank until they puked yet, so we still have that to look forward to. And I think I'm finally starting to get a real taste for Guinness, which may be a bad thing when we get back to the states. I'll leave this here for today. It's dinner time.

      Ok, back for day 2. We went out to Temple Bar for quite a while last night and ended up meeting 2 quite nice English girls at one of the bars. We also ran into a number of Bachelorette parties. One of them had the Bride to be dressed in a cow suite and we ended up playing some of their games, including Craig having to pull on one of her udders and myself having to suck on all 4 of her udders one at a time for 5 secs. Timmy declined to play. I got back to the hostel pretty good, although Timmy slammed down quite a few Guinness' and was having some issues this morning. Today we took a bus tour around Dublin and saw quite a few sites. The first place we stopped was the Church of Christ, which is a huge beautiful cathedral that's in the middle of being fixed up right now. We then looked at St. Patricks Church which is another quite large cathedral. I think we have some pretty nice pictures of both of these. We looked at the outside of Dublin Castle, but didn't go in, also. We took a quick detour to the Guinness brewery, but cut it short since we'll be seeing it with our tour all this week here.  After that, we drove through a very large park just on the outside of Dublin called Phoenix Park. The guide on the bus said that the main road driving through the park was over 2 and a half miles long. There was the second largest Oblesk (sp?) next to the Washington Monument in DC (so now you know what word I'm trying to spell), and there was huge amounts of land devoted to sports. We ran across some people playing Cricket and some others playing a game of Polo. Then we stopped at the Jameson distillery and took the tour there. Very strange to visit an Irish Whiskey distillery and have your tour guide being French. That pretty much ended our day so far. There was a championship Hurling (sp?) game going on in town here today, too. It could only be somewhat compared to seeing the vast amounts of green Packer jerseys when you're near Lambeau field on a game day. There were red/white and black/gold jerseys all over town all day long. I'm guessing the local team was in red/white since there were are so many of them all over town today. We saw some highlights on tv here, and I kinda wished we could have gone to the game today instead. That's it for today. I'm not sure when I'll have a chance to write again, but the first chance I get I'll be back on here. Till then...

      Made it to Ireland(Dublin) this morning around 9:00 am. Got a taxi to head in to our hostel, where I'm writing this from for only 15 minutes a Euro. 10 minutes left... We had to wait until 2:30pm until our room was ready, so we walked a little around town to get in what we could see for a few hours. The first thing was to hit the local Burger King for some food, then we headed to Trinity College nearby for a tour. The tour basically consisted of "George Lucas stole our library for episode 2" and then we looked at the library, but couldn't take pictures so they could charge us for them later in the gift shop. We then headed over to Temple Bar, which is a college town-ish setting with bars, music, and lots of shops. To regress a little, the plane ride went fine. The food was standard, maybe slightly better than average. Wine and beer was served with our meals which help lead to a horrible attempt at sleeping for about 4 hours of the flight. Most of this time I had Tim's head drooling over my shoulder, forcing me to lean way over in the isle. I'm sure Craig had enough room on his side. Running out of time here and I still have to figure out how to post this. Nap time soon, then probably back to Temple Bar later tonight for some drinks.

      hmmm...so I'm at T-32 hours-ish until I leave for Ireland and I'm still trying to get rid of this horrible cold I got this last Sunday (probably from watching that horrible Packers game). Nightly doses of NyQuil and Advil Cold and Sinus medicine have done little more than drain my wallet I was planning on heading back to my apartment for lunch today to get a few more things packed up so I can leave for Green Bay right after work, but things started breaking at work yesterday afternoon and I'm trying to play catch up before the end of the day (but this is still my lunch break!)

      First Post!  I just read on  urlLink Slashdot  that Google is making Blogger Pro free. So I said to myself...."self, we've already got a  urlLink moblog , so we might as well get that blog going,too". So here it is even though I should be in bed sleeping already. In fact, that's what I'm going to do right now. Till tomorrow...

      It's been just over 24 hours since Steph left after visiting for most of the weekend. I'm still not sure if I'm going to get any real sleep tonight yet again. Even though every day sucks knowing that she is practically 6 hours away, it's 10x worse for the week or so right after I get to spend some time with her. After the last 8 years, I still can't put a finger on what exactly it is that fuels my addiction to her. The only thing I can think of is that she is (at risk of sounding cheesy) my-honest-to-god soul mate. I think I've known for these last 8 years that there wasn't anyone else I wanted to be with besides her. Even after a few tries of "let's just be friends" situations, nothing has ever panned out. I can't think of a relationship I've had over the last 3 years that hasn't lasted more that maybe 4 dates. It's pretty much clockwork that right after I'd go out with someone I'd start  trying to find faults in that person just so I had reason to breakup whatever kind of relationship that was built up over that week. On one hand, it could be that I'm just a little messed in the head about relationships in general, or it could just be a way of telling myself that I've already found the person I need to be with. As strange and hard as hell it is to try to explain this to someone, I'd say it's most likely the latter.  hmmm...tomorrow is going to be one long day waiting to hear from her after her first day at her new job. I'm sure I won't be very focused all day. I should try to get at least a little sleep, at least, so I'm not drooling all day at my desk. Wonder what kind of dreams I'll end up with tonight?

      Wow, come back from doing some laundry and  urlLink see this  on  urlLink Fark .  Man, times have really changed since I was in grade school. Whatever happened to liking a girl and writing letters to them and having a friend make the delivery, or daring two people to kiss on the playground? Do kids even get recess anymore? Now all I hear about is some jelly braclet sex scheme or this Viagra incident. I feel so old when I look back and think, wow...when I was in 6th grade the last thing on my mind was trying to convice a girl that a blow job isn't considered sex.

      It's another week here in happy Wisconsin Rapids. I was pretty much dead tired all day today since I didn't get back home here until around 11:30 last night; mainly due to feeling like shit all day yesterday after going out all night Saturday. I think it had something to do with taking that shot at the end of the night... Anyway, it was a fun evening, and I had the pleasure of running into a pretty cool chick named Mandy who was not only very attractive, but could also play foosball (which is a plus). After half flirting with her over the table for a half hour or so she ended up taking off with her friend and although she said she was going to try to make it back over, that was the last I saw of her. At the time, having everyone harping on me to get her number didn't seem that pressing, but now I'm thinking they were right. Well, hopefully I'll see you next time out, Mandy.  My brother revealed to me the joys of  urlLink Happy Tree Friends  Sunday. He had bought a DVD with a few of their shorts on it and I pretty much instantly fell in love. This is my kind of comedy; sick and twisted. I put up a permanent link mainly so that I won't forget how to get to the site. I haven't heard back from Steph yet, so I don't know if she's still planning on heading over to go up to Green Bay this weekend. I have a feeling she'll call tomorrow night during foos league and I won't hear my phone ring and won't get any kind of message until after 11:00. And ahh, yes. Foos league finally kicks off again tomorrow. One of our teammates is going to be gone and I haven't had any luck finding a sub here in town, after talking to Chad a little while ago, it seems like we may have to just pull someone off of the bar to play filler for our first match of the year. Ehh. We've done it enough last year and still took 4th place. Angie is already getting a little grumpy being away from my parent's dog for only a day. I think that I may just leave her up there this next week and then come pick her up when I'm back up for Halloween. As far as Halloween goes, my search for a cheap way of getting hold of a leather corset for my Marilyn Manson costume has failed miserably, and it's not like I'm just going to go out and buy one since I don't see myself wearing it out on the weekends. I think I'm just going to recycle my Michael Myers costume from last year since the only people who saw it won't be out this year. Ahh, only 10:00. I plan to be in bed by 11 so I'm not a drooling half-asleep zombie tomorrow night.

      So here it is...a mildly cold Wed. night. Just finished watching 28 Days Later... which wasn't all that bad. It wasn't what I thought it was going to be, but overall, I'd give it a 6 out of 10. Tomorrow is payday, so I'll finally have money in my account again after my vacation that I can touch without worrying that I'll be bouncing checks left and right. Although not having money for two weeks has made me a little more conscious about some of my spending habits lately. I've decided to drop my phone plan down a notch since lately I haven't been yapping on the phone all day long and mostly keep the talking to the free hours. I just hope that I can keep my 8pm weekday start hour for free calls. I've also decided to ditch the digital cable since I only watch like 3 channels (CNN, Discovery, and Tech TV, ok and I guess Comedy Central, too). If I could just get these plus local channels to watch Packer games I'd be fine.  I might even start selling some of my extra crap here on EBay. Once I find something that's worth a little bit...maybe I can still get some good cash for that Spiderman comic with the first appearance of Punisher... Here's another I'm soooo geeky bit. I'm actually super excited about iTunes coming out for Windows tomorrow. That app. is the damn coolest piece of software I think I have ever used. And it's just an Mp3 player! I'm actually seriously thinking about taking off a day of work next week just so I can finally rip all my CDs to my hard drive while going through my closets looking for crap to sell and changing my phone and tv plans. I think I'm going to feed my face again before bed. I'm starting to get into the habit of having a cup of ramen noodles at the end of the day. It's getting to be that I need my sodium kick before I can fall asleep. Well, it's better than taking NyQuil every night.

      Hahaha!!! I just ran over my links to make sure they were all working properly from my last post and noticed that the SunnComm site now has an investor warning screen before you get to their actual site telling people that they'll basically lose money by investing in their company. What they don't give is the reason is due to them having a product that make Twinkies look genius, comparatively.

      Tonight is going to by my "People are so fucking stupid" rant.  I seriously can't believe what some people will try to sue others for and today we have two of what could be in the top ten examples of people who should be 2 steps away from getting a  urlLink Darwin Award . Here's our  urlLink first story  about a company,  urlLink Sunncomm , that made a really fucking retarded CD DRM technology that it somehow sold. This stupid technology takes advantage of a little thing on Windows PCs called AutoRun, that can be turned off by the user,which when a CD is inserted into your PC, it will run an executable automagically. Now they are claiming that because someone said "Hey, these guys are really fucking dumb. They are using Windows' CD autorun as the basis for their security. For Christ's sake, all you have to do is hold down the Shift key when you insert your CD and you disable AutoRun. Wow, that means that their DRM won't function and if I wanted to, I could just make a copy of their stupid CD anyway". Please, please, please let this trial go on just so everyone  who hasn't heard of these moronic will have a good of laugh as I have had at their expense. Second of all we get this  urlLink really fucking dumb family  living in Illinois (family of stupid bibs) that are going to sue the school district that their children attend because they use WI-Fe (???WI-Fe?? wtf is that? I meant Wi-Fi) networks in their schools and that could be dangerous to their children's health. I don't even know if I have the energy to bitch about this one anymore today. I think I got most of it out on some of my poor coworkers at the end of the day. If I was their son, I would be both embarrassed and pissed at my parents. I would have died for any major kind of net access back in grade or high school besides the one dial up connection in the Library that only allowed for telnet and gopher sessions. I hope that this family lives in a totally unwired log cabin out in the woods where the only form of entertainment on the weekends is the occasional glimpse of a couple of deer fucking in their backyard, because if not, they probably just as guilty for putting out waves of some sort that could be causing their neighbors a slow cancerous growth. If I wasn't too bright, I'd think that suing all the satellite companies would be a good idea right about now. They're pumping tons of waves though me that may be causing me harm and I never gave them permission! The feckers!! That was a pretty weak first bitch session, but I'm sure I'll have better ones.

      Just brought Angie in to get her (front) declawed and spayed. I'm beginning to have flashbacks of my last cat and the 3 days following his neuter and de-claw where he hid under the bed and wouldn't come out unless the apartment was absolutly empty. Then there is the whole "she's got the worst heart murmur in the world" speech I keep hearing from the vets here. I love my cat, but even I know where the line ends when it comes to paying hundreds and hundreds of dollars just to take blood tests. Bleh.....I think I'm just in a grumpy mood today since I had to get up early. It's time to head into work anyway.

      Alright, I've been MIA for a while, so it's time to quickly catch up on some things. I was planning on going up to Green Bay for the whole weekend because I needed to exchange pictures with Tim and Craig from our trip.  Halfway though the day on friday I know that I wasn't going to make the drive up that night (mostly due to feeling like crap, probably from being out later than I wanted to be on Thurday night). So I instead ignored my phone and took an early evening nap which eventually ended up keeping me up until I forced myself to go to sleep at 5am. Well, I took off for Green Bay yesterday afternoon, met up with the boys and then headed over to Craig's place for small get together. A few drinks later and my first game ever of the SNES version of Tecmo Super Bowl (I hate that fucking game), we headed out to, of all places, Harry the Hipsters. It was the choice of some of the girls we were with, so I had nothing to do with it. It actually ended up being a pretty good time even though most of the girls there were my mom's age it seemed. Normally I'd be all like "Damn!" when a girls pulls down her pants to show off her g-string, but not when she looks amost twice my age. Next stop was Ned Kelly's I believe, where we ran into my old Tequila drinking buddy, Betsy. Since my unfortunate tequila accident two years ago, I've had to switch my shots to apple-jacks. So I'm a pussy when it comes to doing shots now, big deal. So after two shots and a lot of razzing Betsy I was already feeling pretty good by the time I headed over to XS with Alisa. This was mainly to keep from going to fucking HipCats again.  After another hefty drink there I was pretty much hit my 'one more drink until puke time' limit and upon bar close, very greatfully gave my keys to Alisa while I tried to remember how to focus my eyes since somehow they got switched to manual mode. Packers won today which was a good deal. Game was actually pretty good watching all the way through. After the game I headed back to my parents to pick up my cat, Angie, eat a little something and then head back home again. Now I'm dead fucking tired and really hungry. Ohhh, my horrible, horrible life. Fine, I'll go make something to eat...

      I'm a little behind on my writing, but I've had a lot on my mind and a major whirlwind ripping through my life right now. I'm feeling the best I have in years, but the coming weeks/months are going to be the deciding factor on all the decisions I make for the rest of my life. Like I said, right now I feel like the happiest and luckiest guy on the planet...even on a Monday! I just read Yoshi's blog and took a quick glance at  urlLink The Rapture  (iTunes link) and I think I'm going to have to delve a little more into their music. The little that I've listened to reminds me of Radiohead meets The Cure meets Underworld. Good call, Yoshi. As a quick sum-up of everything that has been going on with me, Matrix Revolutions sucks. I would have happily paid half price to skip the whole first half of the film ( damn it, no more talking heads!!! This isn't a fucking Oscar winning drama!). Effects were pretty cool, though. I didn't like having to think during the movie. This should not be a thinking movie, it should be a fun popcorn film with any sort of underlaying meanings bubbled up to the laymen by the end of the film. I prefer to leave my thinking cap on to those who know how to make a good movie (see:  urlLink David Lynch ) Work has been a little hectic, but I've been able to work on a pretty cool little windows application for the last few weeks, which has greatly increased my proficiency at programming windows apps. I got to see Steph for the second time in less than a month (Yeah!!!!!) and two days later have an enourmously heart-breaking urge to see her again as soon as possible. I've gotten all unneccessisary bills cut down to their bare minimum and am now fully focued on killing my credit card debt once and for all(thanks, Steph!). My foosball team beat the first place team in our league (damn it, we're still in third place, though). My fridge is now full of leftovers that I will probably never get around to eating so they'll just go bad. I haven't went out for lunch in over three weeks. My cat's getting fatter. I only have Fox News now, so I'm going to be turning into a hardcore conservative in a matter of weeks. I still have the  urlLink new Dido CD  (sorry, iTunes again) in my car stereo. I have managed to bring my only plant back from the dead for the fifth time. Sean's still grumpy. And I finally got around to chopping my hair.

      I shall now be known only as  urlLink Wes Throb . So it's another one of those nights that I can't fall asleep. This last weekend was a pretty damn fun time. Halloween is definately my favorite holiday, and this year may not have been in my top 5 of most fun Halloweens, but it was still a blast none the less. I was a little bummed out that Bob, Joe, and Gash didn't dress up at all, but I ended up having enough fun running around the bars and finding victims for Michael to kill. (see  urlLink my moblog  for pics). After a long friday night, I didn't think I was going to be in the mood to be out all night on Saturday, but soon after going out my extremely funny friends thought it would be great if they bought me a Zima and proceeded to laugh while sucking it down. Haha, I'll just grab a Guinness to wash the taste out, but noooooo. Sure as shit stuck to a terrier's ass, as soon as I lean over the bar to call out my order, another fucking Zima ends up in front of me. Of course, more laughter ensued.  I figured that the best way to thank Bob for the delicious second Zima would have been to buy him one, which is was what caused the 29 Steps Zima incident of 2003.  Next thing Joe has a Zima in front of him, then Whip, then Gash ordered some random girl at the end of the bar one. I tried to help his chances with her by writing his name and number on a napkin and had it passed down to her. Then we ordered one for some random guy at the end of the bar. There's nothing funnier than seeing the look on some burly guy's face when a bartender brings them up a Zima from "someone else in the bar". My sides still hurt a little, although not as much as my hand from the heated match of bloody knuckles at the end of the night. Three o'clock...Guess I'll fight to get some sleep.

       urlLink Apple - iTunes  New version of iTunes is out (4.2). Seems to run smoother than 4.1 did on WinXP. They changed how the maximize/minimize buttons work now, so they actually work like a Windows application. This sucks for iTunes! I always run it in minimized mode and now I can't just swap between normal and minimized by clicking the minimize button. Stupid control-m combo now. I'll get use to it, but I liked it the other way much better(just like how Mac iTunes works). Enough bitching, it still kicks major ass and now I have to go download it when I get home.

      Ok, 3 in one night (posts that is)... I feel bad about writing 2 wussy little bits after reading Yoshi's blog and getting the updating guilt trip. So, here goes as I take another sip of my Captain and RC cola which is amazingly pretty damn tasty for someone who really doesn't care for Captain. Ahhh, let's start last weekend...I met up with Sean, Tim, Wanda, and Cassandra in Osseo to head up to Minneapolis for our friend Britta's B-Day party. Since I'm a well know grandma driver, Sean managed my wheels while I played shotgun on our over 80mph drive to Minn. I was originally hoping to have Steph come out to the party with me to meet everyone, but like I said earlier, we had a bit of an argument the week before and we needed time to sort some more stuff out between us.  Anyway, party was ok. I wasn't in a drinking mood for most of the night, at least not until everyone else was leaving or ready for bed, then I managed to suck down 4 can of high life or some crap like that along with a cigarette with Britta. I got a few pictures posted on my moblog although there should be more but Textamerica keeps fucking up my picture uploads so now I have to manually put the rest of the pictures up. Special mention needed for Sean as Elvis pictures. I finally got to do a little window shopping up on Hennipen St. for the first time in years which was really nice. I've always loved shopping at Saint Sabrina's and it's great to know that it's still there. This week went by pretty quick although last night went by very fast as I ended up sleeping from 7:30 to 3am, woke up just long enough to move to my bed, then slept until 7:40am. Was the only day this week that I didn't give Steph a call and now I feel like I've fallen behind so I made an attempt to wake her up on my way to work.  Foosball league was on Wed. night this week for whatever reason, but it was between us and the other team from our same bar, so it was no big deal. We ended up playing just horribly, losing 13-3. My only saving grace was winning my singles match. Like my team has decided, it was Chad's fault since he had to go on a vacation and could make the game. He's the reason we lost so bad...that and never again on Wed. night.  Wait!! and to top it off, wed. was the horrible snow storm day so by the time I was ready to head out to Marshfield the snow had stopped, but the roads were packed down with ice and snow making a wonderful long trip going at 45mph the whole way. Needless to say, my drinking that night was held down to 4 drinks over a 3 hour period just so I could maximize my cussing and bitching in case I managed to go into the ditch on my way home that night.  How about a new music link for everyone!!!  urlLink Nina Gordon  kicks ass! For those who don't recognize the name, she was the cute blonde chick from Veruca Salt (see one of my favorite videos, Volcano Girls, for reference). Here solo CD has been on constant play in my car in on iTunes at work the the last two weeks. Check out her CD  urlLink  Tonight and the Rest of My Life . Good stuff!

      I can't pass this up. How did people ever eat anything back in the 60's & 70's when  urlLink THIS  is what people were cooking!?   And while you're at it, how about a  urlLink trip to the center of our planet  for a hefty sum of money that is not refundable in any way if there is no entrance to the center of the Earth. Sounds like a deal to me!

      It's monday. Meh. Turkey day was fun, Shopping Best Buy on Friday morning was absolute hell (I didn't need DVD X Copy Gold that bad) and I wish I could have been back home Saturday night. Well, getting home early Sunday afternoon worked just fine after a night of absolutely no sleep, so I just vegged out until 10pm when I hit the sack pretty hard. My birthday night out actually took place on Friday night. I had no intentions all week of staying up past Saturday afternoon, but going shopping with Gash threw that out of whack. Everything was low key and the night finished up at XS with some dancing. As I hoped it would. It was nice to see Chris Prickril and his wife Patti out since I never get to see them anymore. Got a copy of AudioSlave from my sister, Becky (thanks again) which I haven't had time to listen to yet since I was in meetings all day at work. I'll be bringing it in tomorrow, though. Steph and I are at another intermediate step between us. When you don't get the chance to talk to someone for 4 days after being use to talking to them every night, your mind has a way of picking out the few negative things from a sea of positive and focusing on that. I'm still thankful that this is all getting taken care of now instead of later. It's going to be much better to have a few days of 'meh' instead of years. And Sean...stop freaking out over there. You don't need to call and bitch every time I write. Although you should think about getting a job as a critic.  :-P

      Took a half day today, going to be leaving for Milwaukee soon. I thought I'd finally get  urlLink my moblog  caught up a little before taking off. Started downloading all my pictures off of my sprint picture site so I can finally post all the pictures that for whatever reason didn't get posted before. Also put up a picture on here to spruce up the blandness a little, also changed the template on my moblog because I got bored of the old one.

       urlLink   Yeah, I know. Haven't posted in a while...blah, blah, blah. Happy New Year 15 days late, Merry Christmas, and Valentines Day is coming up quickly. Just to make a quick update here, so far my resolutions for this year have held up pretty well, The new  urlLink  Crystal Method   cd is out! (still need to get it and already rubbing my hands in anticipation for at least 3 shows to go to this year)...ummm...Actually  played a video game all the way through for the first time in like 4 years (the new Prince of Persia game for anyone who cares) Went to our local library for the very first time, and manage to score a whole whopping 8 points on this last Tues. night foos league match. Otherwise it's same ol' stuff.   Currently listening to: Paul Oakenfold - Southern Sun

      I had my first 'ehhh' day of work this week. Practically all day was spent trying to solve what should have been a simple problem that turned into a 3 person escapade into the bowels of low level code. Normally I would have been happy with the little day long diversion, but there's a deadline for a release on friday and I still have about 8 more pages to throw together and test, and consider user experience which usually leads to an extra page or two or at the very least a few revamped pages to better inform the end user about what is exactly happening after moving through the pages. I seriously want one of those clown punching bags to have sitting near my desk at work so every once and a while I could just give the thing a pop in the head.  Actually, I just have always wanted a clown punching bag. Anyway, after getting all worked up and frustrated over things never working right the week of a release (see: today)  I was able to let it out at the good ol' Y again. I finally got someone to show my how to use all the big muscle machine stuff so I wouldn't kill myself. Or attempt to use a machine in some way it was never intended, thus most likely killing myself in that fashion. I finally decided to figure out how the fancy bike things work. It wasn't all that bad, and I don't think I set it all that high, but that was alright since I had just come out of the weight room after 40 minutes or so of figuring out what I could lift on each machine and thus absolutely destroying my legs in the process. I still managed to ride for 16 miles on the bike, so that was alright.  And I stop talking about going to the Y after work now. It's just something new so I'm still excited by it. I'm still starving so I think I'm going to quick make another last second meal before bed. Probably should go through the rest of my bag of lettuce that I opened on Monday and is going to be going bad soon. I doubt it will fill me up, but it means I don't have to cook anything right now.

      Just finished working out for the night. I'm starving like mad, so I'm getting some dinner ready and then plan on giving Steph a call before going to bed. I finally got myself into the YMCA to use their weight room and card room, but I still didn't have anyone to give me a run through of the weight room machines (like I even could guess how they work on my own) so I have to make an appointment for next week, but I still sat on a bike for a good 40 minutes to pump out 10 miles. I feel that is pretty damn good for the first time really doing any kind of aerobic/cardio exercise for quite a damn long time.  I actually didn't think I'd even make 15 minutes without passing out and falling off the bike. But surprising myself so much has made me a lot more confident and ready to go back and do it again on Wed. (foosball on Tuesday night still takes precedence). I finally bumped up my lifting reps an extra set after a month and my arms are aching like the first time I picked up these damn dumbbells. The nice cold shower did wonders, though. I just realized that this entry is going to sound like someone else has taken over my blog... Everything is going to be ok...I'll still be out drinking tomorrow night and having fun playing foos. Double good news on the TCM front. Just found out that they are playing at the House of Blues in Chicago on April 23. Two days after the Milwaukee show. Not sure if I'll be going to that one or not, I'll have to do a run by with Timmy. Well, my dinner is ready. Eating is more important than writing.

      Just found  urlLink this band  on iTunes Music Store. Now if we would only start getting those damn Pepsi bottles around here to win free iTunes music, I'd pick up some of their tracks. Very interesting music. Have been playing the  urlLink Unreal Tournament 2004  demo all this week after work. Vehicles are tons of fun, but I'm still very partial to Halo. Question of the day: What is the difference between a man-bag and a man-purse?

      Fuck. Almost forgot the best part. The  urlLink Method  is playing in Milwaukee on April 21st at the Rave. That alone deserves a "it's about fucking time!", but along with it comes the time guess-timations on when abouts the dates for their shows in Minneapolis and Chicago will be. 2004 does sound like a good year to do a repeat of the TCM local shows trifeca*.   *see Tweekend tour for details

      I just listened to  urlLink Mitch Hedberg's  cd today at work and someone started mentioning him on Fark, so I thought I'd give him a quick link. Very funny stuff. Also should have linked this earlier, but  urlLink Firefox 0.8  came out on Monday. Soooo much better than Internet Explorer. This would be the browser that was formally known as Firebird, formally known as Phoenix for those who maybe remember me blabbing those names to them. Today also was the release for the Unreal Tournament 2004 beta. I'm still up in the air on whether or not it's that great. It's kind of fun running around in the new vehicles, but I really wish they drove like the vehicles in Halo. I tend to get stuck driving around the one board that has all the vehicles available in the demo. Ahh....maybe I'll go play for a little while again here just to make sure... Also need to get to bed really soon here because I'm heading down to Madison early tomorrow for a MSDN training session thingy for ASP.NET. It should be pretty cool, I'm hoping to learn at least one or two new tricks. Bah...that is all for today.

      So I walked myself over to Josh's blog today to run into a small little tidbit that got me laughing out loud.   *This may or may not show how up with down I am. I've heard Fred use it and I believe anything Fred says for gospel, except for that velociraptor story which was second hand from Nash anyway, that dude is fucking cracked.   That velociraptor story had been buried in the back of my head for a few years only to now finally resurface.  I don't remember all the details of the story, but there are live velociraptors loose in the states. They have been witnessed. Of course the next thing to pop into my head after reading this was, "A Horde of Zombies!"  As for my lazy way of live here in Bumblefuck, Wisconsin, I have been keeping myself busy trying to keep up with my new years resolutions. Mainly to get into shape again, stay on a healthy budget and get rid of as much credit card debt as I can. Stop buying shit I don't need. Stop using my deep fryer and start eating better. And stop smoking all together. So far I'm doing pretty well. My freezer is filled with my new favorite food (Green Giant pasta and vegetable meals), My weights that I picked up to even just start getting myself motivated to workout have been used at least twice a week all last month here. I'm moving money around in my budget to get a monthly membership for the YMCA so I can use their weight room and cardiovascular crap.  Money is doing fine. The last two things I bought for myself as "entertainment items" were a CD and DVD. The new Outkast double disk and La Femme Nikita, respectively. No buying toys or anything else until I can start pumping a good chunk of money towards my debt. I just got rid of the extra 15 bucks I was spending on my phone for web/txt mugs/downloads/photos and crap and I think I can just pick up a data adaptor that will work with my phone so I can move ringers and photos to and from my computer instead of paying Sprint to move it all very, very, very, slowly over their network wirelessly.   I just re-rented the  urlLink Six Feet Under  dvds ( since they're in the 50cent rental section at Movie Gallery). Really fucking cool show if anyone hasn't watched it. I'll have to thank Steph for bugging me to watch it, although I'm going to pass on watching Sex in the City.  On another side note, I just noticed that when using Blogger's spell checker, if you click on the up and down slider arrrows for the list of suggested words, it will just pick the first word in the list and replace your word without you even clicking the change button. Somewhat annoying.

      Nothing exciting happened today. I did attempt the treadmill at the Y for the first time tonight because there were only 2 other people in the cardio room. I wanted to have minimum dumbass visibility in case I'd go and do something like set the time on the thing for 20 minutes and accidently set the mph to 20 and get thrown off the back Jackass style. I also wanted to make sure I'd function through the first time experiencing getting off it after an extended time. Yeah, I pretty much felt like I was constantly going to fall flat on my face for about a minute after I got off it.  Umm...I've been playing  urlLink Far Cry  lately. Pretty cool game. I wish I have some better digs to play it on, though. It's got the perfect combination of stealth, blowing up shit, and paragliders. What more can you ask for?  Now I'll leave everyone(who hasn't already seen it) with this:

      That didn't help much. I guess I'll try laundry now. Stupid clothes getting dirty. It'll give me a chance to read some of  urlLink Diary  finally, though. I'm a little upset because I just realized that Drew (who used to work with me) still has my  urlLink Survivor  and he's moved to Minneapolis now. Damn damn! I wanted to read that again.

      Nothing like starting a Monday evening getting an email response that shouldn't be a big deal, but just blows your mind and ends up pissing you right off over something you know is insignificant yet it just kills you.  This is the type of thing that I never wanted to get myself into and why I've avoided any kinds of arguments in the past. Now that I have something so stupid bothering me, I just end up getting on a roll and bitching about anything and everything that bothers me in even the littlest bit. I feel like an ass after the fact and I hate it. I just need to take a few days to chill out and stay outside my current situation to clearly evaluate everything before rushing into another round of fists flying for no good reason. Hopefully I'm just taking things too seriously and my other half will slap me back into reality. There's just so much shit going on right now and people who don't deserve it are getting the brunt of my stress in extremely unproductive ways. Steph, I'm sorry x1000. I wouldn't have written you that shitty letter in the first place if I would have been able to talk to you again beforehand. I knee-jerked and want take back most of what I said if you'll let me.  Gash, you deserved to sit in the fucking mall with me all afternoon, I don't take any of that back. You'll probably have popcorn girl call you and you'll still bitch about wasting your time.  Maybe we'll try playing some Neverwinter Nights tonight...Have to find out if Timmy has his copy up and running yet, too. Ok, I'm off to burn my stress off in a more productive way.

      I'm in a down mood tonight (should be in bed already), but I managed to get this quote from a  urlLink fellow Farker's blog . Somewhat fitting for this moment.  Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up these defenses, you build this whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life. You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They do something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own any more. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a body-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love. -Neil Gaiman  I'm guessing that it's  urlLink this guy's  quote, but not positive.

Well, Mr. Bill Heath...after reading this it's my opinion that you being a representative of your state is not an appropriate thing to be doing.

       urlLink This  is why I love  urlLink Boing-Boing . Another notch in my book on why Catholicism/Christianity (whichever is the proper religion faction represented here) is nothing but a large cult (which gives it 'religion' status) led by a group a male, hypocritical fundamentalists. I don't get how a religion can at one second say that peace and love is what god wants, but turn around and say that gays are going to hell while smiling the whole time. And what about this other Christian fundie group (called the  urlLink Crusaders for Christ ...the goggles, they do nothing!) that put out it's new lists of books that should be banned from schools. They included Where's Waldo in this list because, from what I've heard,  in one picture there could be, what appears to be, a topless woman lying on a beach...on her stomach. What the fuck!? If Christians are suppose to live by the Bible, they should have to live by every word. Picking and choosing makes baby Jesus cry. But enough on that...  Dawn of the Dead was pretty fucking cool. I hate going to movies alone, but I didn't get any last second "I'll go!"s from my last post. Imagine that. Not going to spoil anything for everyone who hasn't seen it, but it takes place in Milwaukee. Although no Milwaukee that I've ever been to. One of the main scenes takes place in a mall called the Crossroads Mall.  For the mall that was portrayed on the screen, I definitely don't remember any Crossroads Mall in Milwaukee. But then I found  urlLink this page , which lists a Crossroads Shopping Center in Menominee Falls, so I guess the writers took a little liberty in upgrading this "shopping center" to mall status. Other than that and a few other things that made me think "hey, that's totally not Wisconsin", there were some damn cool explosions, plenty of blood and gore, just enough cheesy horror movie scenes to make you say "you fucking stupid idiot", and Sarah Polley, too.

      Well, the weekend is almost over, again. I had fun going out with Craig, Sheri, Joe, and Jeffy over in Point. I haven't been out in Point for over a good year, so it was pretty nice hitting the old hangouts. My kitchen looks extremely bare now that my foosball table is gone.  I'll have to get something to put there, probably just keep my bike in that corner now. If anyone is still interested, I still have my  urlLink TV up for sale  . Still has over 2 years warranty, bought new and only had it for 1 year and 7 months. $1400.00 I don't need a big TV, I never had needed one, I don't watch TV much anymore. I haven't heard any serious inquiries lately, so it's still up for grabs.  It looks like the sun is coming out. Hopefully it'll be warm enough to do a little biking again today. After picking up my bike yesterday, I took it for a 2 mile ride around town and froze my fucking ears off because of the cold winds blowing directly off of the river here. Mental note taken to wear a stocking hat instead of a baseball cap if it's any bit cold out at all. I didn't end up buying the used bike after all. Plus I really like the silver and green frame on the Giant that I bought. Well, I gotta move. The Y closes at 5pm and I haven't been there since Wed. I'm slacking here.

      Create yourself as a  urlLink South Park character .   I make a rather boring character as you can see.  It's late and I'm tired, but I just wanted to get something blogged today. All in all, it was a pretty boring day. My jackass neighbor who has a parking spot next to me yet again parked like an asshole by taking up half my spot so I couldn't park there...again. I figured he'd get the message after a number of times having to park next to his car within inches (still don't know how he got in unless he got in from the passenger side) and finally putting a note on his windshield last night with an extremely sarcastic 'thank you' written. Nothing else exciting. Ok, well I did go look at bikes tonight after work and I think I'm going to pick one up either tomorrow or later this weekend. One bike shop has a  urlLink used bike  that use to retail for around a grand and he's cleaning it up and fixing it a bit and would sell it for $150. I just have to talk to the bike expert at work tomorrow to see if it's a good deal or if I should buy  urlLink this bike  instead. Either way I'm not forking out over $200 bucks for a bike.  One last thing... I used to love reading  urlLink Gizmodo , which is a techie toy blog, but it's original writer left not too long ago and I have found it beoming less of a "check out this cool stuff" site to more of a "look at something cool that has been posted everywhere else first and I'll try to be funny while writing about it, but fail miserably" site. Thankfully I was given the new site the Peter Rojas is currently running.  urlLink Engadget  is like a reincarnation of the old Gizmodo. Straight forward and no cheese. If anyone likes to be on top of what kind of new tech toys are coming out in the future, this is a great blog to keep up to date with. I'll stop with the free plug now.

      I've just done the most redneck thing a person can do here in central Wisconsin. I've bought a two pack of bandanas from Wal-Mart. No, not so I have something hip to wear while I sit out on the curb in front of my apartment building sucking down a cheap 40. The whole hat thing at the gym just gets annoying so I figured it was time to change over to an 80's style alternative. Hell, I used to wear them back in 7th and 8th grade, I might as well bring the look back. I'll need a white washed, black jean jacket to go with it again, though. I've fond memories of one of my best friend's mom calling a good ol' bandana wrap the "Abe hat". Man, I was so punk back then!  Anyway, I've broken down after having a horrible night of sleep last night and bought a bottle of Melatonin. That shit did wonders for me in college when I would have problems sleeping in an upper bunk bed back in the dorms. It would give you all these crazy dreams and shit, but you wouldn't wake up all groggy like you do when you take Tylenol PM after 10pm. So what kind of night did I have last night? Well, after working out, coming home, and then eating; I laid down on my futon to watch some TV (right around 8:30pm) and before I knew it I was out like a rock. Greta Van Susteren does that to a guy. So I wake up at 1:30 in the morning and swaggle into bed and try to get back to sleep. Well, that didn't fucking happen. So from approximately 2:30ish to my alarm going off at 6am I was awake. I would have pulled the Tylenol PMs, but by that time I would have been knocked out until noon.  I've officially sold my foosball table to a buddy of mine back in Green Bay. So I could possibly put in a makeshift kitchen table for the first time in years. Now I'll just have to sell off the TV and I'll feel a lot better in my personal possession category. If anyone needs a free dresser, I have one of those, too. Ohh, yeah...and a brother printer/fax/copier machine that I couldn't donate to Goodwill since they don't take fucking printers for some unknown reason.  My friend Dean from work brought me in a picture that his 3 year old son drew for me of George of the Jungle. I had gotten rid of all my VHS tapes so I had totally forgotten about George of the Jungle so I told him just to keep it if his sons liked it. I guess they did, so I now have my first 3 year old's drawing made especially for me, which I thought was extremely nice. The melatonin should be kicking in soon, so I'm heading off to bed. Keeping my fingers crossed that I'll hit my 7 hours tonight.

      I was getting worried, but now I know that I'm only  urlLink 19.5% geek .   urlLink This  is what those damn touch screen games probably use for their sex trivia games.  Hugging the hog and crimping the tire, my ass.  Ever since starting to go to the gym (and quitting smoking) I've had an incredible urge to eat a shitload.  urlLink Pasta Accents  have been my salvation since they cost less than $2.00 a package and usually it only takes about two of them to fill you up. White chedder and Garlic are definitely the best in this category. I'm only telling everyone this because I'm working on making my second package right now before bedtime. The damn shit still takes too long to cook.  On a third note, 'definitely' sucks to spell.

      I'd just like to go on record as saying I would very much rather had Charter cables basic service include CNN instead of FOX News so I could actually listen to real news instead of having to wade through hours of shit talk to find a factual story. Watching the O'Reilly Factor drives me fucking nuts, but I'm like a deer stuck in headlights when watching it. When I talk to all those right wing conservative who praises Bush while flat out denying any other potential presidential candidates,  their face slowly transforms into Bills ugly mug. Kinda like in cartoons when someone is hungry and they're looking at some chicken or cow character and as they are drooling from hunger, the chicken appears as a fully cooked meal...that sort of thing. Anyway, I realize how I can make watching that piece of shit show more entertaining. Make it a drinking game. Every time Bill does something hypocritical (like telling one of his guest to not judge someone until they are found guilty, then two seconds later let us all know his judgment on someone else in his next story), you take a shot. Guaranteed to fuck you up in a half hour.

      Holy Christ, it's almost Friday again. Weeks go by too damn fast now days. Hopefully they'll slow down once summer hits full stride. A few interesting bits of news from my neck of the woods: I decided that I should be able to coach a youth soccer team this spring. I'm a little worried that I haven't even played soccer since high school and I'll have to remember some drills and crap for the kids to work on during practice. I'm hoping that they'll be dual coaches on the teams so I will have someone to work with and not look like a horrible coach on my own. Seriously, it'll be lots of fun. Also found out about a group of people that get together on Thurs. evenings to play ad hoc adult soccer matches. There wasn't one tonight, but I'll be getting in touch with one of the guys that put it together early next week to see if I can hop in. I have this weekend all planned out already. I'll be ripping all my music cds to my hard drive (160kpbs MP3 for maximum usage) and then dump all my cds at a used cd shop to see how much I can get for the 200 or so disks I have. I'm also planning on dumping some DVDs that I don't watch anymore. Here's hoping for at least $500 from that sale. My DVD recorder will finally be put to good use, then. Backing up who knows how many gigs of mp3s. I'm guessing around 4-5 disks should back up my whole collection. I also cleaned house on my VHS tapes, a bunch of books I haven't looked at since college, some unused software, and an old ZIP Drive that hasn't been used since college days. Estimated street value at around $600 (using the used section on Amazon.com to judge the going prices of books and VHS tapes. Yes it was over 50 movies and around 50 books. I did keep my Star Wars Trilogy, All my Hitchcock, some music videos, and my First season of Pokemon. Someday I will finally plug in the VCR that I bought to replace my old one that died close to 2 years ago. Does anyone have an iPod they want to get rid of? I still can't justify spending $300 on an mp3 player, but damn I still want one. I did pick up this  urlLink RCA Lyra  which is quite amazing. I can fit a whole audio book (currently listening to The Da Vinci Code) and around an extra 15 music tracks. It's perfect for using when working out and has also been nice to have when walking to between my apartment and work. Now, if I had access to all my music in one mp3 player....yes  urlLink I'm drooling .

      I found  urlLink this link  off of  urlLink Boing Boing . All I can say is what the fuck!? That is one of the most strangest, fucked up things I have ever seen. Thank god for the intarweb!  Played raquetball for the first time since high school today. I would have thought that running around in just a small room wouldn't be all that tiring, but holy shit! I got my ass kicked. I played shitty, but I made it through 4 matches without puking or passing out. I guess that means that all this working out is doing me some good. I think I may look into actually joining a summer soccer team this year. I just hope that there is still an adult league around here. I finally got my federal tax return back today and can say "WOOHOO" now and formally disperse it amongst my bills like the good little tax return it is. I'm still waiting for my dividend payment from my stock that I have for the company I work for. I should be getting a 40-50 dollar check, but it seems that everyone else at work has gotten theirs and I fell left out. Our stock is climbing again since earlier this year when it was at an yearly high (when I should have exercised some of my options), so I think I'm going to bite this time around and sell about 2 bucks lower than what I was going to before. Maybe I'll get lucky and it'll keep going up and I'll get more bang out of it.  I think I'm off to watch a movie. I rented two flicks yesterday,  urlLink About a Boy , which I have heard a lot of good things about. And  urlLink Pieces of April , which I have heard absolutely nothing about, but has Katie Holmes in it, so I didn't think it would be all that bad. I'll probably watch About a Boy tonight...  Sam & Max 2 got  urlLink cancelled  last week.  The original was one of my favorite games when I was younger. This was the only game that actually got me excited like I used to get about cool games coming out back in grade school and high school. It was bigger than a new Final Fantasy game to me.  Now LucasArts has decided that it would be better to release 20 more sub-par Star Wars games instead. As a true geek, I stand and hold my middle finger towards LucasArts' main headquarter's general direction. I think it's out west somewhere, so I'll just flip off that whole area. Ahhh, might as well flip off the east, too. Something probably really sucks out that way, so I might as well privately tell them to screw off, too.  Found a good deal on  urlLink Emusic.com . It looks like has changed since I last went there. They used to have 100 free downloads under a trial membership, but now it looks like only 50 free. Either way, all you have to do is sign up. Download like hell. Cancel your subscription. There, you get 50 free mp3s! I spent my 100 free songs on Saint Etienne's  urlLink Finisterre  ( love Sarah Cracknell's solo music),  Dot Allison's  urlLink We Are Science , Echostar's  urlLink Sola , three CDs from Stereophonic Space Sound Unlimited;  urlLink The Spacesound Effect ,  urlLink Fluid Soundbox , and  urlLink Jet Sound Inc. . Their stuff reminds me a bit of  urlLink Man or Astroman? , but with a martini. Very lounge/surf/spy sounding. Great stuff! Also got Thievery Corporation's  urlLink Sounds From the Thievery Hi-Fi  and with the few leftover songs, I picked a few tracks from Spylab's  urlLink In Utopia . As you can see, I was in a very  urlLink Portishead /trance/lounge mood that night. I have to give a thumbs up to all my choices, especially the Saint Etienne cd. They're all great to listen to while writing code at work.   Well, it's almost 11pm. Better start that movie.

      What a shitty day so far. It's raining right now and a check on weather.com shows that it's going to be raining straight until 10am tomorrow morning. Bahh. If it starts raining any heavier I am going to have to start thinking about canceling soccer practice tonight. Which reminds me, I need to bring all my soccer crap along after lunch here so I have the phone numbers to at least call the parents if needed. Otherwise I'll be sitting in my car outside of the practice field for a while after work. Lunch is pretty much over, my cat is pissed at me about something becuse she's constantly sneak-attacking my arm as I'm eating here.   Got my first set of golf clubs today. That's something else I said I would never get until recently here. But someone at work was selling an old set for $25 bucks, so I thought that would be a good first set. If I think golfing sucks afterwards, then it's not a big loss. Time for work again...   What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink Vixtrola  - Gunboat

      I totally forgot about  urlLink this site  until Fark linked to it. Food was really disgusting looking back in the old days. The commentary that goes along with each cookbook is great. Make sure to go through them all and then make yourself look like a real chef by cooking anything found in these books yourself because there's no chance that it'll look worse than what you'll see here.  Here's the best part I've read off a  urlLink newer one : On top, and to the left, we have “Green Beans in Hampshire Sauce.” Perhaps “Hampshire” was parlance for “milk that has attained an unsavory clumpyness.”  Aw, this milk’s all hampshired. Open a new one.  I remember owning some hampshired milk myself back in the days of not immediately getting rid of expired milk.  Or maybe you shouldn't take cooking advice from a guy who somehow manages to ruin cups of instant ramen noodles.

      Well, hump day is almost over. Let's see...what happened of interest today... Nothing of major interest actually. It was a pretty average day. It was absolutely beautiful out, though. Walking back to work after lunch I noticed what was either an eagle or large hawk looking just like a kid's kite floating in one spot on an air current. Huge bird. Something that simple was pretty much the highlight of my day.   I was working on some pretty cool web page stuff today. Now that we are only supporting IE 5+, Safari 1.0+, and Netscape 6.2+, I can finally dig into developing some kick-ass CSS and JavaScript laden pages. Most of the stuff I got done today is still early in the proof of concept stages and I'm focusing in just getting it to look right in every browser. I would like to bring up that I finally have something to complain about  urlLink Safari , It's CSS support sucks! At least for what I'm working on. And Apple feels that it shouldn't have to keep Safari on Jaguar updated anymore as a way to get people to buy Panther. But they both have the same issues so it's a moot point I guess. Anyway, I think it's starting to look pretty cool. I just hope that others will agree.  I finally got a chance to run the whole  urlLink weight machine  circuit at the Y tonight and I am more sore than I have ever been after a workout. I thought it was just me when I noticed that I couldn't lift as much as before, but the guy who was on the circuit in front of me was bitching about the same machines that I hate. So now that I know it's not just me (it's me and that other guy), I feel better.   I made a quick shopping trip afterwards to get some breakfast food at Copps and was actually quite surprised when I really took a look at what I bought.  Four large Granny Smith apples (the best kind of apple), a bag of oranges (seedless naturally), a box of  urlLink Smart Start  Soy Protein cereal (damn good cereal), and a gallon of fat free milk (I'm amazed I just don't buy  urlLink soy milk  yet, I'm getting so bad). Thinking about what the worst food I eat now is, I'd have to go with hot dogs. But they're just so damn cheap and cook fast over lunch break. Basically a good filler, but I end up making up for the dog by buying wheat buns which really aren't that bad. Usually cost more than a pack of hot dogs do.  I'm crossing my fingers for another nice day tomorrow so I can get out on my bike and take some more pictures.  I'm off to do one more news read on  urlLink Google News  and then I'm off to bed.

      I don't know if I've gushed over them on here or not yet (I'm too lazy to look back over my old entries), but  urlLink Zero 7  is really fucking good. I'm already a pretty big  urlLink Air  fan (and pissed that I wasn't able to see them in Milwaukee last week...and The Crystal Method on top of it) and Zero 7 is pretty much like Air, but with more soul. It took a while to grow on me, but after burning a copy for my friend Sean this weekend, I began listening to it a lot more and it's now on heavy rotation.  Now, since it's Domino's 2 for Tuesday, I will stuff my face with pizza and continue to feast on it all day tomorrow. I should have gone to the gym tonight, but I did a half workout yesterday so I don't want to go back in too soon.   Tomorrow looks to be a lot nicer out than today, so I should finally be able to ride my bike out to the Y again and run the whole lifting circuit.Those damn new machines...forcing you to use them properly instead of just haphazardly plopping yourself down and pulling or pushing on some lever. Now all my weight limits that I had before are 20lbs less because I probably wasn't lifting properly before. I'm guessing it will take a month to get to the same weights I was using before. I also went out and bought some protein mix stuff from GNC (I never thought I'd say that sentence), so I'll see if that does anything over the summer for me.   I'm starting to get use to being bald. It's not all that bad, although I'm suffering from "ghost hair". You know, like when you hear from people who have an arm or leg amputated and they say they get pains or something from the missing limb...well, every once and a while it feels like I have some hair sticking up on the back of my head so I instinctively reach back to brush it down only to find nothing there.  ...pizza's here. Dinner time.

      The time has finally come. I have become sick of my semi-long hair and I will commence the dicing in a matter of minutes  urlLink (WTF!?) . Now, I'd like to remind everyone that I have never attempted this on myself before. True, back in high school I did wear the old  urlLink Mike Patton  long hair on top and back and sides underneath all shaved down to the skin, but that was different.  I got myself a  urlLink Wahl  (it has ComfortGrip tm !) and who knows what kind of  urlLink damage  I will perform on myself. I'm hoping for something that I can spike up, but if I fail I will just go all the way down. It's not like I don't wear my stocking cap or regular baseball hat most of the time anyway. Most people probably won't even notice. Anyway, it's been too long just going to get my haircut from Laura. I need to fiddle with it myself. Wish me luck and godspeed.

      Sweet!  I have a test account for  urlLink Google 's  urlLink Gmail . I wanted to get an early account so I could get abe@gmail.com, but they don't allow less than 6 characters, so that whole dream just went down the shitter. Anyway, I just decided to use the name I put on all my online dealings. So I can be reached at my new gmail account by sending email to  vaeric @ gmail.com  (spaces added to prevent spam). I just got my email address of abe@ihumpmypillow.com for this blog, but I'm just going to trash that one now since I won't need it and nobody has emailed me to that account anyway. So it's not going to be used anymore, don't email me there. So I'm going to move all my email dealings to this account instead of my hotmail and yahoo accounts. I'm going to see if I can forward all my old yahoo and hotmail emails over to this account so I have copies of all my important old emails on those accounts. 1 gig of email space will be SOOOO nice after always running out of room every other day with measly little 5 meg accounts.  Since it's shitty out today, I decided to beta test a MMORPG call  urlLink Ryzom . It's a free open beta test, so it'll be a good diversion without having to pay the monthly fee for now. I think it would be an alright game, but true to its beta-ness, I constantly get high ping and disconnects from the server 5 minutes or so into every play session. Then I have to load the game back up (which takes like 2 minutes) just to have it happen again. So there, I found a bug already.   The rest of this weekend was a lot of fun. Soccer practice on Friday night was a lot better than my first practice. I think I'll have a hold of coaching in another week or so. And my team won their first game 7-2. They played awesome. There's still a few things we need to work on, but the kids all love to play, so it's not too hard to get them motivated. And Alicia, the Assistant Coach, does a great job of reminding me to not skim over details or reminds me when I forget anything important. Very helpful, I don't think I'd be able to keep everything straight without her around. My multi-tasking skills aren't all that great.  Last night was only the second time I've gotten to go out in Point this year. Sean came up from Milwaukee and Gash and Craiger came down from Green Bay. Derek was also at Jeffy's place Friday and earlier Saturday, but by the time Sean and I got over there on Saturday night, he had already left. When UWSP is in session, all I got to say is that going out downtown there has plenty of very nice 'sights' wearing tight clothes. I'm trying to figure out why when we were in school there all we did was bitch about going to these bars when now it sucks when you have to leave. And a night out in Point can be finished without a good trip to Taco Bell. Two grilled stuft burritos and I was out for the night. A little bit of foosball, a few drinks, and plenty of great looking women around always makes for a great night.  But now I'll shut up and go play in my new Gmail account. Kick ass!

      OK, Kill Bill Vol. 2 kicked ass. I was worried at first hearing that it was going to be less action and more dialog (bad memories of Matrix Reloaded. Bad, bad memories), but I should have known that Tarantino dialog is like wiping you ass with silk (the one redeeming line from Reloaded). It just doesn't get old. The fight scenes were indeed fewer than the first volume, but they weren't missed. This was definitely more story driven than action and not in a bad way.  And there was some Eagle Claw action, or I should say, EAGLE CRAW! action. The ending was a complete surprise, very unlike Tarantino but fits perfectly. On a side note, Tarantino definitely has a foot fetish. Definitely. Half the movie is of Uma's bare feet, not that there is anything wrong with Uma's feet, but yeah. Now I think I'll eat a pizza and watch the first volume again.

      After digging through my old VHS tapes and deciding which ones I was going to keep versus which I was going to toss, I went over my tapes from my college video classes.  I have about 3 tapes full of shots that I took with my friend Tracy Marhal, whom I had first met very early on in college, of which I made short film for one of my video class finals.  I never got a chance to really see her during my last year or so at UWSP, which was a real damn shame because she was by far the most intelligent and beautiful girl I had met there. So I was curious to know what she's up to now. A quick google search brought up  urlLink this page . Now unless there is another Tracy that looks exactly like the one I knew in college, that's her. I'm not sure if she's still got the same dry sarcastic humor, but I can see her doing stand up. If you ever end up reading this, Tracy, you'll have to shoot me off an email.

      Hmmm...I'm heavily debating cuttin my hair really short again. Just so I don't have to mess with it over summer and so I can get away with not having to wear a hat half the time to calm my mess down. I'll probably go in some time this week for a good chop. And I want something that I can spike up again. Haven't had that in a long long time. I'm thinking about going out for a bike ride this afternoon, but it's a little windy and overcast. It'll probably be cold down by the river. Bah, what am I saying. I'm just going to be lazy today and loaf around.   Plus I want to go see Kill Bill vol. 2 today still. Man, it's 3:20...I better get going or matinee times will end soon.

      I just found  urlLink this article  saying the  urlLink Smithwick's  can finally be found in America. I've never been this excited about a beer before, but Smithwick's is just so damn good. After getting to have some again since going to Ireland, I think it may have a chance to pass Guinness as my beer of choice. Now if I can only find a pub around here that keeps it on tap.

Never truely played trivia on a team. Helped out some teams here and there, also worked for the local campus tv station doing news casts over the weekend. Good times all around.

      My last day of mid week semi-vacation is pretty much over. I got a lot of biking in, and did some fishing this afternoon. Let's talk about this first fishing experience of the year... Got my rod and my tackle box (for those who still don't believe that I like to go fishing, yes...I own a tackle box) and headed down to the river. I noticed that the line on my spool was a little tangled, but I figured after a few casts, that it would all untangle as it unspooled. Wrong on my part. I should have known that I would have to yet again do the chore of pulling line until all the tangled crap was out and then cut that part off. I do this every damn year, don't know why I thought I wouldn't have to do it this year. Anyway, how the hell does fishing line manage to tangle like this every damn year? Fishing pole gnomes that visit every winter to tie a few knots in your rods? Anyway, I finally get my pole all ready and throw on a nice little  urlLink silver plain aglia  and on the third cast I hook a fish. Cool! It was only my second lure that I threw on my line and within 15 minutes I had my first fish on the line. When I get the sucker near the shore I see that it's a not too bad sized bass. Maybe 3 pounds (about 10-12 inches long).  Now since I don't like eating fish, I strictly practice catch and release. So when I finally get a hold of the guy and go to pull out my lure I notice that the bastard half swallowed it. That's when it hit me that I forgot to grab my Leatherman off my kitchen counter before I left. Well, I tried to get my fingers in the prick's mouth but one of the hooks was so dug into the bottom of his mouth that I couldn't get my fingers in far enough to pull the lure out without seriously poking myself with the other barbs, or without the damn fish biting down on me. So basically, there's a fish now swimming around the Wisconsin River with my sweet aglia still in it. Fucker. I ended up spending the next half hour walking back home, dropping off my equipment, walking to the mall where they have a small hunting/fishing store to get some new lures, call my father to tell him that my first catch of the year kept my sweet lure, and then go buy 3 new lures that are close, but not the same size as my old trusty was. I didn't catch anything for the rest of the evening. I'm going to see what happens this weekend when I get a chance to get out again. My leatherman is safely tucked away in my tacklebox now, so if I catch that bastard fish again, I'm taking my lure back.

      I finally got to watch Kill Bill Volume 1 today. After bitching the whole time it was out in theatres about how I wanted to go see it every weekend I was up in Green Bay, I never got to see the damn thing until now. Finally a movie that you hear so much about how it kicks all this ass and have it actually live up to those expectations. I'm pumped for Volume 2 this weekend and will be asking around work if anyone wants to go see it Friday night or else I'll pull a Dawn of the Dead and just go watch it by myself. I took my camera out again today to take some pictures on my ride to from the Y. 20 some pictures and not one that was worth keeping. Bah. I decided to keep them on my hard drive instead of just chucking them because I may see something worthwhile in them later. I took today and tomorrow off from work to catch up on some more household chores that I was half lazy with this last weekend and to get some other running around taken care of. All sorts of fun spring cleaning. Tomorrow I will definitely be out fishing for at least a few hours in the evening. I already have it penciled in on my imaginary daily planner.

      Why do I have to have a stupid disease?      Doctor Unheimlich  has diagnosed me with  Abe's Disorder      Cause :  dancing     Symptoms :  glowing, enhanced vision, cannibalism     Cure :  smoke a hundred cigarettes every day before meals     Enter your name, for your own diagnosis:        Just my luck, I quit smoking this year and now the only cure is to smoke more in one day than I would have been able to in one month previously. On the other hand, I guess I just need to stop going out dancing at XS when I'm in Green Bay and that should curb my disorder.

       urlLink Boing Boing  has a link to  urlLink The Museum of Unworkable Devices . I was at this site a long time ago, but forgot how cool it was (this is the geek side coming out). If you want some good reading on the trials and tribulations of perpetual motion machines, this is the place to get it.  And while catching up with my  urlLink Engadget  reading, I came across  urlLink this entry  which caught my attention. Very cool, but I still want an iPod.  I also don't know what made me think of this, most likely it was listening to some Stereophonic Space Sound Unlimited, but if you haven't seen the film  urlLink CQ , you should go rent it right away.  It's directed by another of the Coppola family; Roman (see Sophia and Francis). CQ is one of those movies that seems just pretty good the first time you see it, but then you start liking it more and more each time you watch it. I'll have to rent this movie again this week sometime.

      Happy Easter and stuff to everyone! Something else I've done productive today (hey, I've been productive all weekend!), I finally got a photo gallery up and running. I only have a few photos up right now, but I plan on keeping them coming moreso that I did with my moblog. You can find my photo site  urlLink here on deviantART.com . I'll also keep a link to it in my links section to the right. Leave some comments if you see anything you like or if you think I suck. Either way I'll appreciate the interaction. I also got my very first comment very soon after I started putting up my photos.  Thanks,  urlLink belleviolette !  I'm in the midst of ripping more of my CDs. This takes fucking forever. I'm still pissed that I've been missing my Portishead  urlLink Portishead  CD forever, but I still have the case. I miss that damn CD, but I think I know who has it and they probably don't even listen to it. Bugger!   I should start vacuuming the living room like I told myself I would do. I'm debating moving stuff around to liven things up. We'll see. I do keep looking behind me to my collection of first season  urlLink Pokemon  tapes. I think I may end up hooking my VCR up to my tv in the bedroom and watch a few tonight before bed. I haven't watched them in forever and I'm starting to get that itch.  Currently ripping:  urlLink The Orb :  urlLink Orblivion

      Yes! My computer now has a kick ass sound system. I ended up biking on over to Skopko to get some speaker wire because I forgot that I threw out my old wires. Damn it. Am I sad. Maybe, but now I actually can use my stereo instead of having it just sit around doing nothing but taking up space. Speaking of space, not much left on my computer desk anymore. Anyway, phase 1 is finished. Now I just need to pick up a few more things lying around the room and I'll have a ton more space in here. I think I'll bring in my lavalamp and my blacklight and hook them up. You know, have a sleepover or something. Just a little more work and then I get to treat my self to a tasty Guinness.    Ok, I tried posting this all afternoon. I originally wrote this at 6pm and it's 1:30am now. I couldn't post due to some Blogger issue. Anyway, I'm happy with the new romp room setup. I only managed to rip about 20 CDs before I grew bored and wanted to play a little FarCry in surround sound. More ripping will ensue tomorrow. Oh, yeah, Happy Easter everyone! I wish I could be in GB this weekend, but I'll be back up there before anyone realizes I've been gone for overly long. Bob, I'll get to the 8 Mile dubbing tomorrow...or Monday. Maybe Tuesday. Hey, it's not that high on the priority list so it may not be attempted until Wed. G'Night.

      It's 1:30am and I'm just starting to wind down for the day. I was able to sleep in until 11am this morning, the latest I've slept in for about a month now. Sooo nice. I'm popping a few extra  urlLink Melatonin  tonight just because I can, damn it. Earlier this week the damn weather people kept saying how this weekend was going to be cold again after being absolutely beautiful last weekend. Right after I got up this morning, I couldn't help but notice the bright warm sun shining though my bedroom window so I got pretty excited that those fucks were actually wrong again and it could be around 55 degrees or so out. After throwing on some clothes and grabbing some recyclables as an excuse to go outside, I ran into the one thing that I didn't notice while still inside my apartment...really fucking cold wind. So my quickly thrown together plans on going biking and then fishing before 4pm were quietly and skillfully thwarted by Ms. Nature.  I seriously don't remember what I did from that moment until 4:30. I think I ate at some point... nahh, I don't remember. I started calling parents for my summer recreational soccer team.  I meant to start calling yesterday night, but I said I'd play racquetball earlier that day and totally forgot about making the calls until I was on my way to the ymca. Anyway, I'm only down to two more parents. I'm pretty pumped up to start coaching, even if it is just for a month of rec. soccer.   I spent the rest of my evening dicing up old bills/paperwork/bank statements...you know, that kind a junk that you don't want filthy thieves getting their hands on or else they'll steal your identity or your fingerprints or something like that. So I was shredding paper with my tiny shredder for a good few hours along with catching up on my budget that was falling behind for a few weeks. Now I have every thing a-ok and I'm ready to do some remodeling in my computer romp room tomorrow. First off, I haven't been able to use my stereo since I moved to Rapids. There just isn't room to set it up. So I finally had the bright idea to hook the damn thing up to one of my computers since I listen to music on them anyway. And it would make playing games a little more kick ass. This will require an audio card switch between my two machines (which shouldn't be a big deal), so that will be my morning project. After that's done I'll have a subwoofer kicking loud enough so I can hear my tunes while vacuuming.   Speaking of tunes. I've been listening to the Electronic radio stations through iTunes all evening. Switching between the Deep House and DJ Mixes channels hasn't  once let me down for the last 5 hours or so. Well, I've caught up on all the blogs that I like to read everyday so I guess it's time for bed.  Turning on the tv, quieting the volume, and letting Fox News ruin my head.

      The bike ride was pretty damn good. I actually took a few detours and rode for about 10 miles instead of 8, but I'll blame that on the weather. I did hit a pretty big pot hole at one point, though and I think it may have done something to my front wheel because now one of my brake pads keeps rubbing against the rim. I'll have to bring it into Bring's bike shop tomorrow evening to have them look at it. The weather was nice the whole ride, although the wind sucked for a little while riding on my way back. I brought my camera along to take a few pictures by the river when I saw something interesting and ended up getting a few nice shots. I hope to take a lot more pictures this summer and get some good use out of my camera for once. I'll have to look at the photo sites that Yoshi has listed on his blog to see if I can find a good place to put up my photos after a get a few more taken. I was going to go fishing for a little while after I got back from biking (just got my fishing license yesterday), but I decided that I could be lazy for a little while and just ordered a pizza and sat down to watch  urlLink The Haunting  which I didn't make it all the way through due to lack of interest. I finally got to hear from Steph today (which means she got my phone card) and we were able to go over our stupid email argument and patch things back up the way they're suppose to be. The level of stress in my life has dropped dramatically after one phone call. I'll get into the other source of my stress after tomorrow. As for now, I'm going to call it an early bed time. Monday, Monday, Monday is tomorrow.

      I just got back from attempting to take Angie out for a walk (that would be my cat for those who don't know). After hearing so much from my parents telling my that she goes for walks really well when I have her over at their place so she can play with their dog, I thought it would be a simple task. Finally remember to buy a harness and a lease...wait for good weather, take cat for walk by river so she can watch the ducks and people walk/ride by while I get a chance to read. Well...first off, she kept pretending like the harness was hampering her walking ability by plopping down on her back with her feet straight up in the air as if saying, "How the fuck am I suppose to move with this damn thing around my shoulders...I can't even stand up...help! I'm a fat cat that can stand up! SPCA! SPCA!". After finally getting her use to the fact that a lease is not a toy, but a means for me to try persuading her to follow me, we got out the front door. 5 minutes then followed with her having to smell every inch of concrete in the front door walkway. Eventually she took a few steps toward me...and then preceded to move back towards the door to the apartment building. This is the point where I give up on the first walk and just pick her up and carry her the 3 blocks to the river. (I'm really wondering what people are thinking as they see me trying to coax a cat to walk at the end of a leash). So we get down to the river and I put her back down in the grass while I try to read. She sniffs around a whole bunch more for about 10 minutes and then some ducks swim by and stop in front of us as if they're looking at me and Angie, also wondering what I'm doing with a cat out on a leash. Angie was interested in them for a little while before suddenly deciding that they were a threat to her and she needed to seek shelter on my lap. Well, this ended our first trip down to the river. I'm hoping the next few tries go better. It's still nice out, so I'm going to head out for a bike ride...see if I can make it out to the Y and back in good time. Should be about 8 miles total.

      I have decided that today I will just sit on my ass at home after I go do some grocery shopping. I will resume my normal after work activities tomorrow.   Going in to get my hairs cut tomorrow evening. Steph suggested the new Jim Carrey look from  urlLink Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind . It's pretty damn close to what I have been getting cut, and it removes the mini mullet that I usually get stuck with after 2 months. So I think I'll tell Laura (the girl who cuts my hair, stylist if you will) to give me the Carrey cut and if she looks at me what wtf?, then I'll just ask for the regular cut and then sigh really loudly to make her feel guilty that she doesn't spend $10 to see every movie that comes out. I don't get the newly found Jim Carrey love thing going on. I've heard it from a number of women already, so I don't think it's a fluke. I'll determine if it's the hair or not after this next week and write my thesis here.    kinda has a Val Kilmer look to him like this.

         Take my  New  Quiz, Biatch!     Today was a pretty damn nice day after all! Sun actually came out and allowed a good 25 miles of biking before it started to rain for about 5 minutes. Luckily I was pulling up to my apartment just as the rain started. So that gave me some time to eat a little something-something and check the newsgroups online to see if there was anything good. The rain kicked off and I snagged my fishing pole and tackle box to head on down to the river for a few hours of fishing time. I had much better luck going out all earlier-like today than I usually do getting out so late after work. I pulled in around 12 fish although most of them were really small, but I had 3 nice size buggers. This side of the river was full of people fishing, too. I'm guessing these guys were sitting by their windows at home all weekend with a tear slowly falling from their eye until they finally saw the sun come out today. Now I actually don't know what to do for the rest of the evening. It's cooling off too much to go back out, getting kinda dark for going on another bike ride. I should have rented  urlLink Bubba Ho-tep  tonight, but I think I'll get that for tomorrow night (Domino's 2 for 1 night = movie night). I think I'll just end up playing some Hordes of the Underdark for a while and go to bed early. Maybe stuff my face with some food later, too. Yeah. Food sounds really good right now.  And for whatever reason I have  urlLink Sarah Polley  in the head lately  (see previous post bitching about wanting Dawn of the Dead to finally come out on DVD) . Maybe I'll just watch  urlLink Go  tonight instead.   What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink PJ Harvey  -  urlLink To Bring You My Love  - Meet Ze Monsta

       Ward, you'll love this game  I'm not sure why, but I just wasted an hour of my life playing this flash game called  urlLink BushGame.com  (The Anti-Bush Online Videogame!) I actually played through the whole damn game and didn't learn anything new. It does pretty much summerize what Bush has done to fuck up our government, though. And Voltron's in it! Surprise ending, too. Ok, it was actually kinda entertaining.

I still can't justify paying for HBO just to watch this show, especially when you know it'll be out on DVD at some point after a season ends. In this instance they waited too fucking long to get it out. C'mon! The fourth season starts this next month and they only have Season 2 just coming out. Slow ass bitches. We've come to expect our TV series' on DVD promptly these days. With  urlLink Seinfeld  finally coming out, too, all will be ok soon. I'm getting sick of some how only seeing the same 5 different episodes of Seinfeld on  urlLink TB-fucking-S  or whatever shitty station it is that I get that shows it syndicated. I swear that when I watch a syndicated Friends or Seinfeld, 'The Man' knows. So they keep a selection of about 4-5 episodes that they keep showing me in rotation. Just so that I won't catch on to their tomfoolery right away.   What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink Garbage  -  urlLink Beautiful Garbage  - Silence Is Golden

       What happened to the dreams?  After reading a few stories online about dreams and such, I suddenly realized that I haven't had a dream that I remember for well over 2 months now. For me this is high on the Strange-O-Meter as I have always kicking in and out of dreamland even when only half asleep. I'm trying like hell right now to remember what my last dream was and I have no fucking clue. It could be that part of this is due to me waking up earlier. I had a habit of having dreams that would last well into my alarm going off in the morning. You know those ones. Where the alarm is incorporated into your dream somehow and it seems perfectly normal even though in real life you probably wouldn't ignore that fire alarm going off in your apartment building. Now I wake up a good 10 minutes before my alarm goes off so I either sit there and watch those 10 minutes tick by, or else I just slap off the alarm and jump right in the shower.  There's still another day off this fantabulous fucking wet and cold Memorial Day weekend. I swear that last year is the only year I remember this weekend actually not raining. Ever since high school when we would march in our local town parade for band and get soaked to the bone all 4 years, it has been nothing but shit weather. My parents were up visiting from Friday night until earlier today and I was hoping to go fishing, golfing, walking, maybe grilling out, and other fun outdoor activities, but instead we ended up having to stay inside practically the whole time. Bah. No bike ride this afternoon either. I'm crossing my fingers that there'll be a little bit of nice weather tomorrow. Hightly doubtful, though. If nothing else, I guess I'll still go see  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow . Heard it was suppose to be pretty dumb, but the same was said for Van Helsing and I was still amused for 2 hours.  Speaking of movies, when the fuck does the new Dawn of the Dead movie come out on DVD? I need to see that flick again.

       Sign #128 that I'm getting old  The  urlLink French Open  is on tv right now. Serena Williams is playing some chick from Japan and I'm actually interested while watching. Maybe it's because of playing racquetball. Either way, I'm scared by the thought that some day soon I'll start getting excited about a tennis tournament being shown on tv at some point later in the week.

       Weather.com can toss my salad  Those fucks haven't gotten an extended forcast correct since the weather broke 50 degrees here. I'm assuming they just put up some arbitrary weather forcast for all days over 3 days in advance. Then, like magic they change it from sunny to rain or the other way around at the last second like no one is going to notice. Sunny and warm all this morning according to them earlier this week and now automagically this morning they change it to rain. Nice job there, fucktards. It's a good thing you got Jimmy watching out the window and updating your site when needed.  What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink Delerium  -  urlLink Chimera  - Serenity

        urlLink Bunk!     bunk  (bungk)  n.  1. Empty talk; nonsense. 2. a ludicrously false statement example: "What a load of bunk!"  Ever since college, whenever I see or hear someone use the word bunk I immediately giggle to myself. The group of stoners that i had hung out with threw that word around so much that it eventually became part of my every day vocabulary. My usage of bunk in everyday talk has now been reduced to covering for saying 'fuck' when in presence of people who wouldn't quite appreciate the clear-cut meaning of various 4-letter words. Bunk fills this void nicely. So next time you need to express yourself around those that would banish you to hell for yelling fuck out loud, just yell bunk!

       I'm slacking  Haven't updated in a while, but I've been somewhat busy lately. Monday night was taken up by trying to clean off old video card drivers from my computer at home and apparently I came up short. So I'll be reformatting my main machine this weekend. In turn this means that I'll be backing up a ton of data this week (thank god for having a dvd burner). After playing with my machine for a few hours I plopped down to finally watch Princess Mononoke and easily fell asleep halfway through. Yesterday at work I lost half of the rose model data I've been doing over the last 2 weeks so I'm in the middle of quickly restoring it before this afternoon when we'll be going over it with some of our project group. The weather got a lot nicer after work so it was bike ride time followed by finally getting an odometer thingy for my bike and some grocery shopping for home and for a pot luck thing we're having for lunch today at work. I rented Return of the King and once again promptly fell asleep halfway through. The nice part of having 7 day rentals is that you can do this repeatedly until you finally make it all the way through. Tonight is back to the gym for once and then maybe some fishing if the weather stays nice like it is right now.

      Ahhh, the Avril thread is finally fixed on Fark. I was going to enter this bug in Bugzilla, but it seems that  urlLink someone else  already got there. And the bug was opened a full year ago! Best way to keep this from happening in the Fark forums is to prevent users from using the list item tag all together.

      I'm having fun playing with a  urlLink bug on Fark . It might not last long and is near the end of the thread. Apparently you can escape HTML from your private little div comment section by using a mixture of some badly formatted HTML. I'll probably be chastised for messing with it, but they seriously need to fix their HTML parser for comments before every thread starts to get manipulated like this.  I just checked it out using IE and everything looks completely normal. So most likely anyone without much HTML knowledge (those who use still use IE) has no idea what half the thread is talking about. As much enjoyment you can get out of an Avril Lavigne thread. And I actually don't mind Avril's music all that much.

      Boing Boing has a link to  urlLink Rapture Ready . This is some good stuff! I highly suggest the  urlLink FAQ section . I'm still wondering why it's broken down into so many topics when Silly basically sums up everything here. There is so much good stuff on this site.  Just got back from seeing  urlLink Van Helsing  with Alicia a little while ago. I thought it was worth the price of admission. It kept me entertained throughout except for a few parts that were just totally unbelievable even though during popcorn movies I surpress the urge to keep physics and such on the wayside. And there was way too much swinging from things. I think when the writers got stuck in the script they just decided to make the characters swing from something. I think Alicia concurs with me on that one. Lastly, every time Van Helsing was shown without his hat on I kept thinking about a certain  urlLink 80's glam rocker dude . Helsing's comic relief partner's (who was actually pretty funny) flip cut also reminded me of a  urlLink certain singer ...  I'm continuing to rip my CDs for the rest of the evening. Need to throw some dishes in the dishwasher. Probably going to watch  urlLink Princess Mononoke  before bed. Maybe I'll even bring my VCR into the bedroom and watch a  urlLink good Hitchcock flick .

       Update on the weekend so far.  I won my second ever racqetball match Saturday morning, taking the place of Jason from work. Basically I won our first game by about 3-4 points, got skunked the second game (still don't know how the fuck that happened), and should have won the last game but lost 14-15. Gave up a huge lead in the last game too. Fuck. It was suppose to be a crappy all day Saturday, which I was hoping that it would at most just rain a little so we would still have our last soccer game (this rec. soccer season is too short with only 5 games). Well, it wasn't all that bad out during the game. Overcast, pretty warm, and no rain. I think the game was about 10 minutes too short, but we still won 4-2. So our team went 3-1-1 for the season. Not too bad for the first time coaching. I think I was just given a really talented group of kids to work with. The rest of the day looked to be shitty now because it started raining a little. I figured any shot for a bike ride would have gone down the tubes, so I asked Alicia if she just wanted to go see a movie instead. Of course, right when we get to the theatre the sun comes out and it jumps about 15 degrees. So we decided to call Robert and grab our bikes instead. After the bike ride I made a quick lunch consisting of Fun Dog brand hot dogs. These were some cheap-ass hot dogs that were fifty cents a pack of 8. Normally, that price would send off internal alarms telling me that there is no meat at all in them, only pig brains and cow eye balls ground up and smushed together to form what looked like a hot dog. Well, the alarm did go off, but my thrifty shopping skills took over when comparing the price of a pack of pure beef hot dogs to the pack of mixed bits and figured that just trying out the cheap ones once wouldn't kill me. Maybe give me the shits for a few days, but that'd be it. So Fun Dogs it was. And I'll tell you, they taste like hot dogs should, but there's still that little voice in the back of your head constantly telling you what's exactly in these cheap fuckers. I'll go back to the all beef dogs next time. I then grabbed my fishing pole and headed down to the river. Once again I pulled nothing in. I did better on Friday night when I pulled in a nice sized sunfish and had something big on my line for a good 2 minutes before it broke free. I didn't see any of the other guys fishing around the area pull anything in either, so I didn't feel left out. After a good 2 hours of fishing, I took off to wal-mart to buy 2 more  urlLink Rapala 's. The one I did have was white and black, so I wanted to pick up some with some brighter colors.  Getting later in the evening at that point, I threw  urlLink Snatch  into the DVD player and laid back on the couch. That pretty much put me out for the rest of the night.  I'm currently in the middle of ripping the final few of my CDs to iTunes. I should finally be able to pack all my physical CDs away in the closet by the end of the day and get around to selling them at some point. I would like to go out fishing again soon here.  urlLink Weather.com  is being retarded and telling me that it should be storming right now, but they should the weather map that has no activity near Wis. Rapids whatsoever. It may end up being a go see a movie day after all.    What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink PJ Harvey  -  urlLink To Bring You My Love  - C'mon Billy

      The new video card has been installed. I just finished beating the  urlLink Neverwinter Nights , Shadows of Undrentide expansion and have played through a few other of my games for a little while to see how this new baby pumps out. Not too bad. I just touched on Far Cry and Unreal Tournament 2004 and those both played worth crap. I'm hoping that it was just a driver issue that got solved after a few reboots and a sound card swap. I do know that  urlLink Max Payne 2  ran pretty damn beautifully all jacked up in detail. I guess I'll try UT2004 again to see if it actually runs the way this card should be putting out, then on to bed.

       "Fun for the whole family!"   urlLink The Turd Twister!  This is the kind of stuff you run across when you read through the comments on Fark. This one is pretty funny, though.  I went  urlLink geocaching  for the first time this evening after work. Dean brought in his  urlLink GPS receiver  for me to borrow, so I rounded up Alicia and Robert from work to ride out with me. The cache we went after was placed right off of Lake Wazeecha and the bike path, so it wasn't way out of the way or anything. It did end up taking us about 15 minutes to find the dang thing even though I passed by it at one point by looking at a suspicious pile of sticks in the middle of the woods and then walking away only to return 8 minutes later to actually dig into it to find the cache. It was pretty cool, though. There are a few more within biking range that I'd like to get to this summer, too. Gives a little something extra to make the bike rides more fun.

       Unfucking believable...  I have been trying to remember a song that I remember hearing back in the early 80's off of one of my sister's mix tapes she had and for the life of me could only remember the melody. No lyrics. Finally, after over 15 years of trying to figure out what that song was without embarrassing myself by having to hum it to various people, it pops up as the end song in The Office. I swear I haven't heard that song since right around when it came out until just now.   urlLink Yazoo   - Only You After listening to the Yazoo original version (the one from The Office was a remix), the one I remember is still different. Instead of the synth sounds making the music, it was someone's voice making the "bah-da bah-da bah-da bah-da. Bah-da bah-da bah-da. Bah-da baaaaaaaahhh-da." sounds. I'm still digging around trying to find it now that I know the name. If anyone has any idea where I can find this other version... I should just ask my sister if she remembers what exact version she had.  Unfucking believable...

      I got my hands on the two The Office Christmas specials. I watched the first one and now I'm on to the second one. I guess these are suppose to wrap everything up nicely and I already read what happens, but I won't mention anything here for those who haven't seen them yet. This really sucks because I want more new stuff and I already have all the episodes. 14 episodes and done.  Damn you British with your need to cut off a show before it gets a chance to become old and tired!

       urlLink This page  is pretty cool if you're a computer geek. It's a live camera of  urlLink Final Fantasy XI . Just start up the live feed and watch the camera rotate around a city as people run about their business. Ok, so it's not really all that exciting, but the idea is pretty cool.   I ordered a new video card for my computer yesterday as part of my plan to slowly upgrade my machine over the next year. I bought a  urlLink Radeon 9800 Pro  card from a shop I found on  urlLink Pricewatch . That shop would d be  urlLink AllStarShop.com . I figured they had great prices and a good rating, so I'd go with them. Well, things didn't quite work as planned. They responded hours later after I send my order with an email saying that I couldn't have a different shipping address than my billing address unless it was registered with my bank. WTF!?! I had never heard of this before, nor have I ever encountered it from any of the dozen other online stores I shop at. So I call my bank to see what the fuck is up with this stupid request and they never even heard about companies wanting this info. And on top of that, they had no way to add an alternate shipping address to my account. They could only change my billing address which would not be very fruitful towards my monthly statements arriving timely. So it was late, about 11pm when I finally had noticed the email (why the fuck they didn't call when I wanted 2 day shipping I'll never know) I was slightly perturbed so I ended up writing one of my heavily sarcastic (or as Steph likes to refer to it; passive-aggressive) letters telling them they are morons and should call me immediately in the morning to let me know if they can ship it or not with my work address as the shipping address. The dumb fuckers never called so I finally called them right after lunch because I want the damn card here before this weekend so I have something to keep me busy by moving video cards around between my two computers. Anyway, after talking for about 10 minutes to some chick that had to keep putting me on hold as I calmly debated my side of things (most likely to talk to someone else who should have been on the phone with me in the first place) I got my order ready to be sent. Now I have to fill out some shit online so that FedEx will just drop the package off without needing a signature. The last thing I want to do is play the "just missed you" game until Monday. So that's that. I want my new card dammit.I also bought a nice little converter that will allow me to hook it up to my HDTV and finally display my system in 1080i instead of crappy S-video like I did previously.  That's it I'm done bitching for today. I haven't been grumpy in a while, so I feel like I'm allowed for a few days here...those fuckers.

      I just got the DVD+Rs that I ordered last week. I forgot how exciting it is to get something from the UPS guy even though you already know what it is. So I can finally start burning again. I bought a 100 pack of  urlLink Linkyo  brand 4x speed. It only came to $68 after shipping so it was a great deal. I'll let everyone know how they work after I get a chance to make some burns this evening. Now if I can only decided if I want to fork out $200 bucks for a  urlLink ATI Radeon 9800 Pro  card. Man, I really want to, but I know that as soon as I buy one it'll drop $20 in price the next week or so because of the X800 line.

      Today ended up being another great day. Here's hoping to this week being nice every evening so I can enjoy some of the  urlLink Bike to Work Week  things going on. Today I made an early morning ride out on the trail going through  urlLink Port Edwards  (the trail that goes past the Y) trying to find where it's suppose to be extended and go straight to  urlLink Nekoosa . Well, I didn't have much luck so I just headed back after taking a little look around for anything that looked like a bike path. I knew that it was suppose to be on the other side of a mill, but all I read were employees only or  urlLink No Trespassing signs . I wasn't in the mood to act ignorant this morning, so I figured that I'd just wait until they formally "open" the path this week. So I got back home, ate a small lunch, played with my cat for a little while, opened some more windows and then got back on my bike. Yesterday Alicia mentioned that riding along the river heading north was suppose to be a good ride, so I headed on north and brought my camera with me to grab any pictures that looked interesting. I rode for about 7 miles north along the river before the road curved away from the water and the scenery got boring. Before getting boring it was really beautiful along the water, though. It actually reminded me of Door County most of the ride. Brought back a lot of good memories of growing up in  urlLink Sturgeon Bay . I also kept my eyes peeled for any houses along the river that happened to be for sale, but didn't find any. I'm really thinking that I would seriously buy a house around here if I could find one on the river for a reasonable amount of money. On the way back I took an alternate route just to make sure I knew about where I was at. This cut straight across highway 54, and then turned back into town on Washington St., which is the street where we have our soccer games. Then I cut down under 54 again, back down to the river and followed it back to my apartment. I think I took about 20 pictures, but I haven't taken them off my camera yet. I'll probably do that tomorrow and see what I got. That bike ride took about 2 1/2 hours and should have put my total milage for the day at around 25. I was going to hit the river again to do a little fishing, but I passed for a good dinner and gave my parents a call to see what they were doing today. Played with Angie some more, hit all my regular internet sites and now I'm ready for bed. I gotta be rested and get all zen and shit for tomorrow's racquetball matches. Don't want my one win to be a fluke.   What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink Veruca Salt  -  urlLink Eight Arms To Hold You  - Venus Man Trap

      Long day.  I was out last night with Chad(one of the guys from my foosball team in Marshfield) and his friend Stork. We ran between Johnny's, Lance's Inn and back to Johnny's. This town seems to be pretty dead until 1am. Pretty much why I don't care to go out in this town. We did find some good foosball games at the end of the night, though. I didn't get to sleep until 2:30am so it was a chore getting up early this morning. I was hoping to go to the Y before our soccer game today, but I was feeling too run down when I got up around 8:30 (see, I get up early now on the weekends!) so instead I just took my time waking up and then ran to the grocery store to buy some milk so I could have some breakfast. I took some time to catch up on some news and then planned out my starting lineup for our soccer game.   The kids came back after being beat last weekend to win today 10-0. I had to keep my better forwards playing defense the second half so they wouldn't keep scoring. I'm sure they didn't like it, but I also didn't want them running up the score anymore. We only had 9 kids for the game, so I only had one sub to work with at a time. That's kinda hard when you know your front line is getting quickly worn down and you can only break them one at a time. The nice thing, though, was that the refs were calling the game in quarters instead of just halves. So the kids got extra time to get a breather. I was very proud of them today.  I wanted to take advantage of the nice weather for the first time this week, so I got Alicia to go out biking with me after the game. I had planned on doing a little more than just that bike ride today. Mainly I wanted to at least go fishing for a while, but I grabbed something to eat after I got back home and then took a nap that ended up lasting until 6:30 and then was sucked into watching some god awful show on Fox News...yes, I know they all are, but this one even had a horrible host...yes, I know they all are.  I've been looking at doing some  urlLink geocaching  lately. My friend Dean had just picked up a GPS receiver and was telling me that there are around 6 caches just around Wisconsin Rapids here. I've been looking over eBay and some other stores online to see if I could find a cheap receiver, but they never seem to drop in price. Even the older models are still over $80. And I'm having a hard time forking out that kind of money for one at the moment. I think I'm just going to borrow Dean's for a day here and there this summer. If anyone does know where I can get a pretty good receiver (used or new) for cheaper than $80, I would appreciate the information.  So now I'm back on the computer and writing crap that most people bitch about being useless internet filler that bogs down their search results. Well, I'm happy to help fill in some of that useless void.   What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink Gwar  -  urlLink Scumdogs Of The Universe  - King Queen

       My 1 minute Google rant   urlLink Google  had better be seriously thinking about creating their own branded Instant Messenger or at least something that runs in your system tray on Windows or Dock on OSX. I'm starting to get sick of constantly checking my Gmail account for email when all I want is a nice little application to be running in the background that lets me know when I get new mail. Actually it would be nice for this application to be more like a RSS reader than a typical IM service with email notifications. If Google has API's for this I'll write the damn application myself if I have to. Damn it Google! I can see you're moving towards portal status, so you might as well give us this, too. Hey, isn't there like a little Google bar thing that you can install to your taskbar in windows? Put this in there even. And skip the Internet Explorer Google bar. I don't use IE, I use FireFox and already comes with a built in Google search. Who do I have to send an email to around here to be heard!?

      This is pretty good stuff... While deleting my spam I ran across this subject line:  Ad- After a hard workout at the gym I love to take a shower and let the guys pee...   My yahoo mail account had cut off the end of the subject line, so naturally I had to see the whole title and opened it to actually get this:  Ad- After a hard workout at the gym I love to take a shower and let the guys peep at my big natural h00ters SEXUALLY-EXPLICIT   It was quite a let down after thinking it was going to be about golden showers at the gym. And I wouldn't advise opening your spam if you have HTML viewing enabled. Disable that crap! And don't show images images by default, either.

      All I want to do is make an iFrame on my page set it's height to the size of the document it loads. That's it. I found some javascript that works for all browsers we support on PC, but Safari 1.0 just crashes, and Netscape 6.2 just ignores everything. Any javascript wizards out there know a good cross-browser script to dynamically set an iFrame height? I need it to work on both PC and Mac IE 5+, Netscape 6.2+ and Safari 1.0+.  I'd be pulling my hair out right now if I had any.

      I've never really been one to vent on something that I feel that I found on my own and then get pissed when everyone else discovers it later, but I feel like writing some more before heading off to bed tonight. Our 1am topic: Angelina Jolie   This is my favorite picture of her and actually reminds me quite a bit of Mindy. Angelina is the one person that I get riled up about when people start talking shit about how she's so awesome and hot and that Girl Interrupted is the first movie they have seen her in. I remember back in the day when there was only 1 website devoted to Angelina. Had around 5 pictures on it and a listing of 2 feature films in her bio. Hell, that was even way after I first discovered Angie. Back in high school I would love to rent really cheesy sci-fi films from our local video rental store. One day I rented Cyborg 2 soon after it was released. Well, for as horrible as the movie is when looking at it from a non-bias viewpoint; I rented that thing like 10 times before finally just dubbing it. Yes. Angie at age 18 is when I first discovered here and fell in love. Not "stalker in love", but I knew she was going to be hot. As I followed her through FireFox and Hackers, no one seemed to care. But after Gia came out, whoa!! Now that we have mainstream titties, Angie is cool! And on we go until Girl Interruped and finally the first Tomb Raider movie comes out. Before all this crap you could talk about Angie and not get glared at by the opposite sex. Now you mention her name and half the female population either hiss and rant about how they don't understand how men can be attracted to her, or you get the half that would fuck Angelinathe first chance they get. And there is no in between as far as I can tell.  So 2 things I'm getting at in this unnecessary bleating of words: I knew way before anyone told the rest of you that Angelina was big and I'm sick of people giving me a huff and eye roll when I tell them that I love Angelina (not in that stalker way). I was around way before 99% of the fans now and way before the media hyped her up.  And yes; I named my precious fat cat after her.

      Ok, it's time to go over what I've heard from E3 today. I'm starting to feel young and stuff again after hearing some announcements this year. I actually haven't been as excited with an E3 since Nintendo unveiled Mario 64 all those years back. Anyway...on to my thoughts.  Nintendo is looking mighty good. The  urlLink Nintendo DS  is cool not for the fact that it has 2 screens, but because it has built in WiFi and what says here (courtesy of Gizmodo) is Nintendo's own proprietary wireless protocol. That kicks ass! I also read that you can set your DS to turn itself on when it comes within range of another DS. I'm already thinking of lots of cool applications that can use this feature alone. And it can support up to 16 players in a game wirelessly! That sells me right there. You get a few people at work with these things and you can have some instant fun over lunch break with no hassle. I'm liking that! The  urlLink new Zelda  (right click to save as...)  looks kick-ass. I still don't want to pop out $100 bucks for a GameCube, though. I'll be most likely spending my money on upgrading my home PC soon instead (if that damn 9800 Pro would just drop to like $150).  urlLink Halo 2 multiplayer  looks awesome. If it plays half as well as it looks, Microsoft can sign me up for a year subscription of Live.  urlLink Doom 3  on XBox also looks good, but I'd rather play that on PC along with hopefully Half Life 2 very soon here.  Sony's  urlLink PSP . Now here's something that should take off pretty well. Something like the iPod of handheld systems. As far as I can tell, it's going to be marketed at a more adult audience than the Nintendo DS. If it's not, then it should be. Also running WiFi for connectivity means that it should kick ass. Now... the proprietary discs they use, Universal Media Disks, can hold up to 1.8 gigs. Using proper compression and codecs, one could easily fit a pretty damn nice looking full movie on one of these guys. Sony, give us recordable UMDs like a MiniDisk. It already comes with a 16:9 screen. Come on! Games and movies on this sucker would validate a $250+ price tag.  As for the games,  urlLink Silent Hill 4  looks cool. Although I still haven't finished Silent Hill 1-3 all the way through yet, I do love those games. They can seriously scare the hell out of you when playing at 2am with all the lights out. Mario Party 6 for GBA should be cool. The  urlLink new expansion  for Call of Duty equals must have.  urlLink Fight Club  will most likely be piss-ass-poor and ruin its good name. And of course all the good stuff that never showed up after last year's E3.   I don't know why I get excited for new games anymore. I never have much time to play them and even if I do my attention span is way to short to sit down for extended hours.  On a totally different note...there is a house for sale in Port Edwards right on the river(well, actually it's right across the street). 4 bedrooms, 2 baths for under $100,000. I'd seriously think about getting a house in town here for 3 more years or so if I could get one right on the river for about that price. This one is damn close. Damn close. I don't know why, but I've been on a big kick that I finally want to buy a house. Prices are so cheap around here that for $100,000 you can get a real damn fine place, too. Another reason why I can't afford to be buying games and new games systems.   What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink Saint Etienne  -  urlLink Finisterre  - Shower Scene

      Monday is over and done with finally. I was all ready earlier for a rant on how I hate having to support 15 thousand different web browsers for our project at work, but I'm over the majority of spiteful anger at all those developers who built all the web browsers and who are most likely smarter than I'll ever be. I'll just sum it up to: Latest Mozilla/FireFox(Netscape 7+) = Good, IE6 on Windows = Good, IE5 Mac = Suckiest piece of shit browser ever made, Netscape 6.0-6.2(and Mozilla counterparts) = More stupid sucky CSS support, Safari = Jesus Christ, Apple, don't keep Jaguar users on 1.0 or whatever the fuck version of Safari you decided was "good enough" and then give Panther users 1.2 which still sucks just as much but in totally different ways so I have to check on 2 different versions of OSX just to see if your fucking browser is working properly! Fuck!   Ok...I'm better now.  I finally won my first racquetball game tonight. I was going to pick up a big star shaped sticker from Shopko to wear to work tomorrow so that everyone would know I'm a "winner", but I have a feeling they all pretty much feel that way about me anyway. A big star sticker would probably just add "special" to that title. I stubbed the fuck out of the big toe on my right foot tonight, though. Smashed it into the wall while playing tonight. Damn thing still smarts, but as I said earlier, I still won the last game because I played though the pain like a real man. Yeah! Fuck yeah! (*insert imaginary high-fiving and chest beating)  I was hoping to get back tonight early enough to go fishing for a little while. Jim from work gave me one of his jigs that he has been using and catching some nice size walleye. I'll probably try heading down to the river at lunch tomorrow and give it a quick go.  I got my last 2 movies from my free 2 week  urlLink Netflix  trial.  urlLink Love Actually  and  urlLink  The School of Rock . I'll probably watch Love Actually tonight and hit School of Rock tomorrow night. Then it's going to be back to the occasional new release rental ($3 bucks is too damn expensive for movies that are just going to be 'meh') and loads of the $.25 rentals. My favorites!

      I'm just going to put a link to Boing Boing over in my Clicky section. I swear I find at least on kick-ass post there a week that I want to re-list here. This was just posted over there;  urlLink musicplasma . It's a cool music search engine that links artists by their type of music and displays them in a cool cluster of globes tied together by strands. It also uses the size of the globes for each artist to display their popularity. Bigger the globe(I guess they actually call it a Halo), the more popular they are.

      Blogger just did a pretty big upgrade to their site, so I grabbed a new template of theirs for now. I also think that I can run comments though blogger instead of using squakbox like I did before. Either way, all my old comments are flushed and gone.  This weekend has been...well full I guess. I decided to go to the Y before the soccer game on Saturday. The last time I went in on a Saturday morning I thought I was going to pass out after 15 minutes or else puke. Maybe both. Anyway, I made it a bit better this time. I got through all the machines but one before feeling a bit light headed. I'm just not use to working so hard in the mornings. So after that I got ready for my teams soccer game at 1pm. The kids did end up losing for the first time. 3-6 or something close to that. They played hard and did very well even though they lost. I'm sure we'll kick some butt next weekend. After the game I had a pretty damn good lunch and then laid back on my couch to watch the last three episodes of The office. I guess I was half asleep when I tried to watch them last time, so I needed to go back and actually watch them this time. After that I commenced in a nice 2 hour nap and then met up with some of the guys from work for a small get together(tiny LAN party-ish) to play some Unreal Tournament 2K4. That's always a lot of fun, although I hate lugging my computer around and then having to plug everything back in after getting back home. I got up around 9am this morning to what looked like was going to be a dreary day. I attempted to get ahold of my mom to wish her a happy Mother's Day, but got nothing but the answering machine for my first 2 tries. The sky ended up clearing up around 1pm and soon after Robert from work gave me a ring to go ride Lake Wazeecha with Alicia. So before I headed out, I gave my mom a call again and finally got a hold of her. It ended up being another fucking nice day and the ride around Wazeecha was great. I was planning on going to see Van Helsing this afternoon, but I started having second thoughts and decided to go fishing instead.   Today's fishing tally:     3  total bites.   1  bite equating to a lost lure (bastard fish).  1  start of a possible back of the neck burn.  1  coke drank.  3  pretty hot rollerbladers. Actually I just decided to head back in after the group of girls rollerbladed by and then went out on another bike ride to see what else was out on the trails today. So I put in around 20 miles on my bike today. My heaviest day of biking so far this spring. I still want to do 3 laps around Wazeecha one of these days. That should be about a 25-28  mile total bike trip after riding from my apartment and then back. Hopefully I can pull that off this next weekend. I think I'm going to watch The Matrix Revolutions pretty soon here. Just want to remember if it was as bad as it was in the theatre. First I'm going to hit the shower. I'm starting to smell a little bit nasty here.   What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink Tiësto  -  urlLink In Search of Sunrise 3  - Solarcoaster

      What have I accomplished tonight? After getting back from the Y, I made a mexican pizza (tasty).  Ended up watching the Friends Finale thingy after telling myself that I wouldn't earlier because I haven't really watched it in like 2 years (I'm just going through the DVDs instead). But it was as good as every other Friends episode. I guess you either like that show or you don't, though. I didn't like the last scene with the foosball table. Just too horrible to describe here. And for everything that I've been through. The whole Ross and Rachel getting together in the end wouldn't actually happen in real life. What would have happened was Rachel would have told Ross that it was too late and then she would have still left and any sort of contact would slowly dissolve until conversations were whittled down to meaningless grunts about how they're really busy and they don't have much time to really talk, but they're ok, and they hope the other is doing ok.  Filled out a few bills. I like paying the few bills that I can, online. Much faster. I hate writing out my address and shit on envelopes.  Fed Angie again. She was a little grumpy about being shorted on food earlier today. The girl's getting a weight problem...I do what I can, but I'm a softy for an upset girl.  I'm deciding what I want to eat again. Carrots will work I guess. Tomorrow is already fucking friday. I have no idea where the weeks go anymore. Seriously. Weeks go by so damn quickly now. I guess that's a good thing, but I feel that before I know it I'll be 30 and wondering what happened to my last few years in the 20's. I'm semi-seriously thinking about looking at some prices on houses in town here by the river.  Semi-seriously because I don't know if I want to buy a house in this town. But now that it's so nice out again, I love being out by the river (as long as it's  far  away from the paper factory). I'm half debating whether or not to see  urlLink Val Helsing  this weekend. The few reviews I read haven't been all that nice, but it still seems like it would be a great popcorn movie. I was hoping the same when I saw  urlLink Underworld  and that really let me down, though.

      I just got done watching  urlLink Big Fish  for the first time. Great film, very romantic, I would have loved to watch it with someone curled up on the couch. Now Fox News is on in the background. The  urlLink O'Reilly Fuck^H^H^Hactor  is on and all I hear in the background is nothing but pure hypocrisy. What a fucking mood killer....hold on a second. That's better. TV was on for too long tonight anyway. I'm all set for bed. Tomorrow morning is definitely a full sausage and eggs breakfast morning.  Oh,yeah. Tonight's bike ride was excellent. Great weather and  urlLink Lake Wazeecha  was quite pretty for this early in the summer/spring. I'm looking forward to riding the  urlLink Green Circle  a few time this summer at some point.

      Back home from work and doing my daily email and blogs check. Half of the blogs I read on a regular basis have been barren lately. I read only a handful of sites each day. Mainly  urlLink Fark ,  urlLink Slashdot ,  urlLink Google News ,  urlLink Gizmodo ,  urlLink Engadget ,  urlLink Boing Boing ,  urlLink Warp2Search , my email, and the handful of blogs that I have bookmarked. Actually, besides Google News, these are all blogs I guess. Anyway, you people should be writing something at least every other day so I have something more to read.  I'm getting ready for a good long evening bike ride, so I gotta get moving.    What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink Tiësto  -  urlLink Nyana  (Disc 2) - Beautiful Things

      It's already becoming a sad, sad tuesday evening. When I got home after work I saw some of my laundry still sitting on the drying rack and couldn't wait to try that kung-fu style shirt folding that I posted a few entries down. I gotta bring a movie back, got an itch to check out some Goodwill clothes, and then heading over to they Y again.  Also watching movies like a bat out of hell to get some use out of a free 2 week  urlLink Netflix  trial. It's way too nice outside, I'm out'a here.

      I'm still getting email messages about the  urlLink Gmail  invite I was giving out yesterday night. That invite was sent off early this morning, so I'm all out of invites at the moment (my other invite went to a friend).  If I get anymore invites, I'll be advertising them on here and not for money. Maybe I'll hold some kind of contest of something (just something dumb).  So maybe watch here if you want. I don't know if I'll get anymore invites or not, though.  Cheers!

Like a radio phone-in giveaway. If I have any more invites to give out on a later date, I'll make another random post to give it away to someone.

Don't waste $60.00 on eBay. I'll send the invite to the first person I get an email from.  Updated on  5-17-2004 : Some search engine or blogger index must have just updated to include this entry since I have gotten another 5 email regarding this entry today. My Gmail account invites were given away the day after this was originally written. Sorry, but no more Gmail invites from me for now.

       urlLink Boing Boing  has a link to a  urlLink BBC Real Audio documentary  on chillout and ambient music. I just noticed it so I haven't been able to listen to it yet. It sounds great and it better include the godfather of ambient music;  urlLink Dr. Alex Patterson  &  urlLink The Orb .  I just rented the first and second seasons of  urlLink The Office  and I've made it through the first three episodes. Great stuff. I feel sorry for Dawn, the secretary, though. The end of the second episode was absolutely horrible. Like I said, great stuff! Dean stopped by to let me borrow his copy of Big Fish, so I'm going to watch that tonight before bed.

      I'm currently burning Nirvana's Unplugged CD. I haven't listened to it in ages and it's bringing back very strange, yet vivid memories. It's amazing how a song/smell/sight/sound can instantaneously bring a person to another point in their life without any advanced notice or warning. Sometimes the resulting feeling is great. Sometimes the result is extremely hurtful. Sometimes the result goes back so far that feelings don't end up playing a role. I haven't had the experience lately, but I have had it before when a smell would send me off to a time when I was with my father in Green Bay (when I still lived in Sturgeon Bay and Green Bay was a big city) and I was told that I could pick out any He-Man character I wanted before we left for home. For some reason that moment in my life left a signal. I can get a certain smell and go right back to that exact time and place. It's easier with music, though. I can hear a great number of songs and instantly be transported to a previous moment without warning. Many times it's due to things that I'd rather forget or times that I really would rather miss than remember. There can be good memories, though. Whenever I listen to The Orb I think back to my days living in the dorms of UWSP and I miss every second that I spent there. I guess that either way the memories come back, they never seem to bring back a smile. It's always a pass time missed or a time that you would like to have fully forgot.  Now that I think about it, it's strange that you don't hear about people experiencing this. It's like everyone hides these feelings.  I have to think about this some more and try to figure out how I can write a book on it and make enough money to move to the Bahamas by the age of 32.

      Ahhh, it's finally come the the end of my first Saturday of May. Much better of a day than I thought it would have been. How did my day go? Well, after getting up and fully mobile, I sat down at my computer desk, turned on some music, and filled out my starting roster for our soccer game today. Not enough people were wishing my team luck, though. We tied 6-6 this week. My kids played excellent again even though we just tied. They really worked their butts off this game. After the game the weather stayed nice enough for me to head out for a good 10 mile bike ride. I was actually quite amazed that there weren't more people out on the rec. trail today. Usually after a few days of crappy weather, the first nice day has the trail packed. Since it was still really fucking nice after the bike ride, I headed down to the river for about 2 hours of fishing. I am very unhappy to report that I had not even one bite and lost another damn lure on my second cast. Another 2.50 down the fucking drain. The rest of the evening was spent talking to Gash on the phone (really wasn't worth the time...something about cat scat), eating a crapload of food, and finally getting back to ripping more of my CDs. Basically I said screw it to all the things I 'should' have been doing today and just enjoyed the nice weather. Parents will be here tomorrow and monday so there won't be anymore updates until monday night...unless something really fucking cool comes up in the meantime.   What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink From Dusk Till Dawn Soundtrack  -  After Dark -I gotta get this on DVD, haven't watched this flick in like 2 years. In fact, I'm just going to go fucking rent it tomorrow.

      Since I'm in the middle of playing around with CSS at work, I thought I'd do some practicing on here later on today. A little formatting here and there should spruce things up quite a bit on my blog. And then when Tues. comes (Monday taken off!) and should be ready to finish the pages I have been working on for the last two days. Of course this won't happen until after our soccer game today which I need to start preparing for and after a good bike ride, barring any bad weather. Doesn't look too bad though my dirty window here... Wish my team luck today!

       Leaving for the Grabaawr   Well, I'm leaving in about 40 minutes to Eagle River with one of the guys from work. I'm all packed and ready to go. This ride's going to kick ass and it's going to be a nice 3 day vacation. I plan on having my camera with me most of the time to take some photos that I'll put up on my  urlLink moblog  after I get back. I'll also have my phone camera with me and I'll try to take some photos with that along the way. So hopefully there will start being some photos popping up later this evening or tomorrow morning already. Well, I'm out.   Later.

       Leaving for the Grabaawr   Well, I'm leaving in about 40 minutes to Eagle River with one of the guys from work. I'm all packed and ready to go. This ride's going to kick ass and it's going to be a nice 3 day vacation. I plan on having my camera with me most of the time to take some photos that I'll put up on my  urlLink moblog  after I get back. I'll also have my phone camera with me and I'll try to take some photos with that along the way. So hopefully there will start being some photos popping up later this evening or tomorrow morning already. Well, I'm out.   Later.

       mobscene   I just noticed that Googling for  urlLink mobscene , the name of my moblog, shows it listed in the #4 position. I've already overtaken a ton of Marilyn Manson fan sites. Next step is to take over the number 1 spot and get sued by Manson for some sort of infringement. I need more links to my  urlLink moblog  to get to number 1!

        urlLink DVD Rewinder    I found this pretty hilarious. I remember joking about rewinding DVDs a long time ago when rentals stores first started to carry DVDs. I rented one that had the ol' VHS "Please Be Kind And Rewind" sticker on it. Who knows how many people actually bitched about having to rewind their rented DVD after they watched it and actually used the back scan button. Pity any dumbasses who only had double speed scan in the early days of DVD players. Thanks to the DVD Rewinder, there's no longer a need to waste all that time rewinding your DVD in your player. That's time lost that you could have been watching that other movie you rented.  via  urlLink Gizmodo

       Sunny with a chance of 'meh'   Average day all around. I was psyched to get done with work so I could run into Point and pick up the last bits of gear for this weekend. Not only did I not find a damn thing, but I also missed Campus Cycle and The Hostel Shop. That's what I get for running to Fleet Farm and Target first. The one thing I hate about stores around this area is that they all close at either 5 or 6pm. So now I'll be running back there Thurs. right away after work. Need shoes/pedals, another pair of bike shorts, I'm trying to find a 1-man tent, but that's seems just impossible around here (I got my fingers crossed for the Hostel Shop). So I came back home with a 4 dollar pair of sunglasses from Big Lots (I forgot how much fun it was to look at all their crap), and a bag full of batteries from Fleet Farm. Yes...I bought, for the first time in my life, 20 bucks worth of batteries. I guess I also got my phone's firmware/OS updated and so far I haven't had issue of it rebooting itself. It's also running fast as fuck when uploading pictures. I hope it stays this way.  I think I've stayed away from Point for a good enough time that I can now enjoy it again. I loved riding through town today. I think I just needed a good buffer time between in-school and post-school to properly adjust to living in the same town going through 2 distinct lifestyles. And I just love it by the river here. I know I've been saying that too much lately, but I think I'm finally coming to find that I'm perfectly happy living in a small town like this. I'm not counting out ever living in a big city, but I'm just saying that I'm not complaining about living here anymore.  I forgot to add earlier that I went golfing (real golfing) for the first time this last sunday with Robert from work. I don't know my total score for the day, but I had at least 2 holes around 13-14 strokes, one hole with 6 (a par 3), two holes with a 7, and a few with 8 and 9 strokes. My putting sucks and I tend to like to criss-cross my way towards the hole. First stroke will send me way to the right side in the rough. If I find my ball I then end up wacking it way to the left side in the rough, and continue until the green. It was still fun even though I fucked up my wrist on the first hole by trying to get my ball out from under a tree and when I went to swing, the club head got stuck in a branch and somehow I pulled a muscle or something in my wrist. It sucks because it gets a little sore when I bike after a while.   I checked out the "Irish Pub" that opened just a few blocks from me not too long ago. I asked for a Smithwick's on the off chance that they were an actual Irish pub. Of course they didn't have any, but I guess their Guinness on tap was pretty good, They just don't give you a real pint. It's just one of those American like pint glasses. But it was nice and quiet in there. 2 dart boards and a pool table, too. The owner said he'd look into getting some Smithwick's. So now I'll have to keep checking back in to see if he gets any.   Now I'm going to be bored for a while before bed. I'm in one of those moods now that I really don't want to do anything. Even watching tv sounds like work.

This will totally flop for one, and on my second finger is this great line:   "...the pocket CD carries a selection of music tracks and mobile phone ring tones from a host of artists ranging from 50 Cent to Black Eyed Peas."

       Are you a pillow fucker?   Well, if you've been having issues trying to hump your pillow and just not getting a good grip on that fucker, or just can't seem to get off on the feeling of rubbing your pecker on polyester filling, then  urlLink this is for you!   I have no idea what any of this page actually says except for the words '1 Chance Kiyo' and the word 'penis', but I'll tell you this much...our friends in Japan have finally found a way for pillow fuckers to finally be able to hump their pillow like a pro.  I'm still slightly disturbed that the 'torso' pillow looks very...well, manly.

        urlLink Probably going to be a stupid game    Blinx 2 will most likely really suck, but  urlLink Gizmodo  has a pretty funny blurb on it.   The theme of the sequel is that you get to play on both sides of the Blinx universe morality spectrum, which as of now still only has good and evil but may be increased in future press releases to good, evil, cake, table, orange, and indoors, depending on how well the marketing department did in philosophy class.

       Bring out the nerds  One of my favorite blogs,  urlLink Engadget , has a sister blog called  urlLink Joystiq  that I somehow had seen before, but overlooked until I saw it listed on Boing Boing earlier today. It's a blog all about gaming and slaying dragons and saving princesses. Any grown geek should love this site.   At least now I have something to read like this instead of just  urlLink Warp2Search .   I don't even play games that much anymore, but I still like reading about that shit. I guess it's been ingrained in me since I was a wee boy and had subscription to all the old classic video game mags.

       Is it possible  Am I am the only man on this planet to have rubbed some yellow Vitamin-E gel shit on his ass for 2 days in a row? And probably would have gone for the talcum powder were there any handy? ... In other news...*cough* Well, I'm falling behind on shit I should be doing, like getting that cable bill and electric bill ready to drop off tomorrow at their respective drop points during lunch. Picking up a few more lures and then actually getting back down by the river to do some fishing. Grocery shopping (I have no food in my fridge anymore, I'm living off of frozen hamburgers patties and brats...not that there's anything wrong with that). Picking up more shit for that bike trip thingy next weekend. Vacuuming my carpet. Throwing my dishes in the dishwasher. Tuning my bike's gears. Playing with the cat. Laundry. There's probably some more shit I can't remember off the top of my head.   Anyway, it seems that everyday after work I'm either getting ready to go riding or prepping to head to the gym. After either of those is done, then I'm ready to eat a big fucking dinner and then my body goes into what I call "I'm not fucking moving anymore" mode. The leaves me either sitting very sloppily on my computer chair as I read some of my favorite web sites, or it leaves me in a comatose state on my couch as I drool myself to sleep watching something only half interesting on either Fox News (blech) or the National Geographic channel. Tonight I'm slouched by the computer.  I am thinking about moving to the couch, though, instead of just hopping into the shower for a cool drenching and then plopping into bed. Speaking of bed...  My stupid damn tv in the bedroom is fried. That trooper lasted me all through college and a few moves after that even. My poor 19 inch Sanyo that cut off about 2 inches of screen space on the right hand side. It sucks not having something to watch in bed. That's the kind of shit that puts me to sleep. Now the only reaction I get from the piece-o-shit when you click the power button is the normal clicking sound of the tube turning on and a faint glimmer of light around the edges of the screen just to tease you before you hear it click back off again. Fucking tease. Anyone got a 19 inch tv they don't want anymore? I don't want to buy a new one, but then again I haven't checked prices on 19 inch tvs lately, so maybe they're only like 50 bucks and I'll just pick up some shitty brand like Goldstar or Emerson since clarity of the screen is the last thing I'm worried about when watching though half shut eyes. Fuck, I gotta pull my old video card out of my other computer to give to Dean tomorrow.  Actually I think I'm going to make that couch move. I have 2 more hamburgers left over from my 'eyes too big for my stomach' stop at Burger King tonight. I can microwave those fuckers and while scanning the walls for the best spots to put up my Kill Bill frames and getting a little bit of Fox News in just so I have something to make it feel more like bed time.  I wrote way more that I intended to.   What's playing on iTunes at the moment:   urlLink Foo Fighters  -  urlLink Foo Fighters  - X-Static

       A little something to spruce up the apartment   Ok, I'm back on a huge Kill Bill kick so I bought  urlLink this poster set  off of eBay. It has the Vol. 1 poster with mylar sword which is totally sweet and two Vol. 2 posters. These babies are going to be framed and going up in my living room as soon as I get them.   Finally something that I like that will add a little flavor to my otherwise boring, plain white walls.

       Sigh  Before heading off to bed, I did a quick search to see if there was any info yet on the new  urlLink Dawn of the Dead 's DVD release date. Well, I guess I found it and it isn't going to be until October. Having to wait 5 more months makes Abe very sad. I hope there actually is going to be a resurgence of Zombie films like this web site says there will be. Ummm...ok, I forgot the name and URL for that site, but it was a pretty cool, up to date site listing zombie/horror flicks in the works.   So anyway, that news is pretty depressing as is, although not as much (due to less waiting time),  urlLink Kill Bill Vol. 2  coming out on August 10th. I had promised myself earlier this year that I would go see more movies in the theatre, but so far I've only gone to see Return of the King, Kill Bill Vol. 2, and Van Helsing. So far that's the only new year's resolution that I haven't been doing a good job of holding up.  I got to bring back some rented movies tomorrow after work, so I think I'm going to pick up some random horror flicks I haven't seen yet. Not quite sure what, but when you get 50 cent rentals, you really can't go wrong.

       What seemed like a long day  Day's over and I'm getting ready to hop into a nice cold shower. I didn't quite make my 40 miles today. I only made 35 before my ass started burning and I ran out of water. So my grand total for the weekend is still a commendable 96 miles (I'll get the other 4 tomorrow). After finishing my run today with Robert and Alicia through Nekoosa and around a whole new route (that was actually pretty cool), I took a quick 5 min. break to fill up my bottle back at my apartment and then headed back up for Biron. I decided just short of hitting the 10 mile mark heading out that my legs were not going to make it, so I pulled up short and headed back. By the time I got back into Rapids I couldn't wait to just plop down on some grass for a while and take a short rest, so I headed to the small park between the our two smaller bridges right  down by my apartment. Shade would have been nice to sit in, but gad-damn mosquitos were everywhere as soon as you got under a tree. So my rest took place out in the hot sun instead. Fun. I've been getting nasty cravings for ice-cream a lot lately that I've never gotten before. Today I was halfway into talking myself into riding back up to Dairy Queen when I decided that I could just run to the grocery store and get a gallon of ice cream for half the price. It was a sound decision that didn't get quite fulfilled since immediately upon returning home I just went to take a short "rest" on the couch which ended up being a 4 hour nap instead. Now I'm going to be up half the damn night because I'm all awake again.  Well, tomorrow I'll be buying my gear for the GRABAAWR (sent in my registration this morning) after running my choices by Jim A. from work to get approval on whether or not my choices are crap or ok. I guess I'm going to be skipping buying the full biking clothing get-up because my sister had said that I'd just look like a bike geek because nobody wears all that stuff on those long tour rides. So, due to my sore ass tonight, I am not holding back on getting the most comfortable padded bike shorts money can buy, and then a nice pair of gloves, helmet, tools, tire repair stuff, bike pack, rain gear, and a cheap pair of good wrap around sunglasses should be all I need now.   I think I'm going to be popping some Melatonin soon so I can be sure that I won't be up until 3am like I was last Sunday. That kinda shit doesn't make for a fun Monday at work.

       Unbeliveable  Today was suppose to be all shitty-shitty, but I should have known not to trust those weather.com fucks again. It's a clear sky out right now and biking will commence again in around 45 minutes. I want to put on another 40 miles today even though my legs feel a little numb. I relooked over the itinerary for the GRABAAWR and now the travels of 51 miles (Day 1 from Eagle River to Rhinelander), 57 miles (Day 2 from Rhinelander to Merrill) and 62.8 miles (Day 3 from Merrill to Stevens Point) don't seem all that threatening anymore. I'll feel like I accomplished quite a bit if I get 100 miles in for the whole weekend, I just hope it doesn't start raining before I can finish riding.

       Phase 3 completed   and motherfucker...my legs are totally cashed.  Total tally for today's riding is 61.020 miles over 4 hours and 35 minutes.   Of course that time was split in 20 mile increments from 11am-ish to 9pm, and I went to the golfing range and ate a big lunch in between.  Wazeecha was a little wet and muddy, so now I'm going to have to hit the shower again before bed, but first I'm going to eat a whole cow or the equivalent if I can't find a cow to eat within the next 20 minutes. Now I'll just have to find out if I can do 3 straight days of this kind of riding.  I'm going to sleep like a baby tonight.

       Phase 2 finished  Just got back from another 20 mile-ish ride to Nekoosa and back. I took a shower and threw on some Vitamin E gel shit on my back to calm down any burn that I may be getting. Now I'm really in the mood to finish off a 60 mile day, so I think that I'm going to throw on the shorts and ride out to Wazeecha and back. It should only be another 1 and a quarter hours or so. After that I'll feel alot better about doing 70 mile days coming up in two weeks. I'm outtie again.   Commence phase 3...

       So far  I got 23 miles put in on my bike already today. It's absolutely awesome out. It's in the upper 70's and the sun is out. I get to work on trying to get somewhat of a tan while riding. I couldn't ask for much more. Lunch is being made, then it'll be off to the driving range (just by myself) because I just want to hit some balls. Hopefully soon I'll be able to go out a few times with Jeff and then we can get a group up here to play Sentry or the cheap course here in Rapids.  Foods getting done...cat's biting my feet, apartment is cleaned a bit. I'm good for the second half of the day.

       Sprint has great customer service?!  At least tonight  urlLink they  did. I just looked over my little 2 months of PCS Vision for free deal because I saw that they talked about it being only 1MB of traffic usage per month. That would basically mean that I could upload about 10 pictures from my phone before they would start charging up the ass for data transfer. So, I bucked up and called customer service to see if I could see what exactly I signed up for. For one, I hate that they start up this whole 'Automated phone service' thing as soon as you connect to them. I hate automated lines more than anything else in the world, but at least Sprint was nice enough to enable you to immediately kick out of the system by saying "operator" at any time. It's better than some of those other systems that make you have to fuck up entering your social security number like 20 times before it kicks you over to a real person. Anyway, I get some guy on the line right away. Actually I don't think I've ever had to wait very long to talk to a Sprint CS person. I ask him about the deal and keep questioning him if it is unlimited access or not. He doesn't know, but he says it looked unlimited. Here's where I start playing stupid and say that I think mine was suppose to be unlimited but a friend had an offer for only 1MB of traffic during the free period. He sees that my free Vision pack is indeed this 1MB deal. I was getting ready to tell him to just get rid of it because it's useless to me when he attempt to tell me about kilobytes and how many bytes it would take to use up this whole whopping megabyte of data I got to play with. I think the plan sucks and he's talking to me like I'm totally computer illiterate. I keep playing stupid and ask how many pictures that would be per month before I went over the limit and some other shit when he finally says he's going to look into something for me and after a short time tells me that he switched the deal from the 1MB per month to the unlimited because he even thought it was worthless. Sweet. Just listening to someone try to explain to you about uploading vs. megabytes vs. kilobytes vs. picture sizes when they think you're not a techie gives you bonuses. So I got my 2 free months of UNLIMITED access like I should have had in the first place. I want to take a few candid phone-cam pictures during the  urlLink GRABAAWR  and now I don't have to worry about it costing me $200 on my phone bill because I uploaded more than 10 pics to my moblog. Now I'm just going to have to see what they can do for me when my contract is up next month. They better give me some sweet ass deal or I'll be thinking about going somewhere else. Number portability may be put in use in the near future here...unless they give me a sweet ass rebate for a new phone and throw in 7pm starting time for my unlimited minutes.

       It's still fucking rainy outside  This is like three days in a row now that it's been cold and shitty outside. I want to get some good biking in for these next 2 weeks, but it looks like I'm going to have to end up sitting on a stationary bike over at the gym instead. Weather.com says it's suppose to clear up around 6pm but I believe them as much as I believe a talking turd (no, I'm not referencing Mr. Hankey here). Bah, where's the damn summer already?

       Still listening to Faith No More  Wow, I'm getting flooded at the moment with tons of memories from high school. Mainly from my freshman year when we took our yearly band trip. Freshman year's band trip was to Colorado. It was also the year that Angel Dust came out (1992). I remember picking it up pretty much right before we left for the trip and it was in my little personal CD player for practically the whole trip. I'm not going to wax on about little moments that I remember here and there, but  I've been laughing to myself for the last hour or so thinking over some of the shit we did over that time. It's really strange how listening to music can instantly bring you to an exact place and time of your life. I can even remember smells. I don't know about everyone else, but I don't have any kind of music that puts me into a bummed out mood. Everything that I listen to seems to have a place in time that it locks into. And I may be lucky enough that each of those places and times are extremely happy and crazy times. Well, Nina Gordon does bum me out a little, but that's too recent to mention.  I'm just going to look over everything here in iTunes and match up music to what time it goes with...  Faith No More (Angel Dust) - Colorado Band Trip (obvious by now)  REM (Out of Time) - Bought this the same day I first played Zelda for SNES. Still remember listening to it while reading the manual before playing. Yes, I'm that guy who likes to read the manual all the way through before actually playing a game.  Beastie Boys (Hello Nasty) - sitting outside Bob's parent's house and buring ants with a magnifiying glass. That was a kick ass summer away from college.  Future Sounds of London & The Orb - Turning on the blacklight and lavalamp in my dorm room and chilling out after a night of going out and smoking a little something-something.  Dot Allison, Suicide Machines(Sometimes I Don't Mind) - The first few months of being single again after dating someone for close to 2 years and being clumsy with my first few dates. Christ, I'm still clumsy. Sometimes I Don't Mind was my little baby Chihuahua's song.  Yazoo (Only You) - sneaking my sister's dubbed tapes out of her room so I could listen to them when I was really, really young.  Underworld - Becky's apartment in Point while at college and all the hijinks that went on over there.  Sneaker Pimps - Spring break away from college at home. After getting home from The Basement and watching MTV in my basement on a little tv while stuffing my face with whatever food I could make without waking up my parents.  Thurston Moore - Band practices with the 10 Dead Prophets. I really loved his solo CD back in high school.  Suicidal Tendencies, Guns and Roses - Wow, summers up in Sturgeon Bay pre-middle school days.   Damn, there's just tons of them in here. I wonder how many more I'll have in the future since the amount of good music I have found lately has dwindled and I find myself going back to the good old favorites and those won't imprint again. Time is a very peculiar thing. I really wish I could have a recording of everything that has passed in my life so far. I swear it would make a great film, but just to me.

       Tonight is officially shit  In the power invested in my by the state of my apartment, I declare tonight to be a shitty night. Not only is it raining, but I feel a little bit of my semi-monthly depression coming on. Not as bad as I use to get it, but I'll probably be grumpy tomorrow and keep my hat on over my eyes or put on my sweatshirt and hood. I was planning on pulling out my computer tonight to the living room and hooking it up to my tv to play a little big screen Thief 3, but I'm feeling lazy now and decided to wait until this weekend. I think a big part of feeling 'meh' tonight is due to the fact that since it's raining I couldn't go outside and do anything. I did run to the video store to grab some older movies that I haven't seen in a while, but I don't even feel like popping them in tonight now either.

       I stayed awake through Matrix Revolutions  I ordered my 2 for 1 Domino's, ate till I was stuffed and then slapped in  urlLink Matrix Revolutions  for something to fall asleep to on my futon. I'm not sure how it happened, but I stayed awake through the whole fucking movie. I almost managed to doze off a few times, but it was always right before some part where all of a sudden the music jacked way up or something and I felt obligated to turn down the volume a little bit. See, I plugged my DVD player and XBox into opposite Hi-Def inputs than I had before I moved my living room around a few weeks ago. I had forgotten that I had the DVD player plugged into the other inputs because the volume, for whatever reason, is really low in the current set of inputs. Plugging my XBox is that set sounds fine, though. It's just very strange and probably is something with my DVD player instead of the tv. Anyway, I had to fight with the remote to turn up and down the volume so I could hear some parts and quiet the louder parts. I'll be switching the component cables around tomorrow.   I guess it was worth staying up because when I switched off my DVD player, I had Conan O'Brien on and he was just introducing someone called  urlLink Simple Kid  to play. The song kicked ass (Staring at the Sun). So I'll be looking into this guy later this week, too. Now it's bed time. Right after I put the fan back in the bedroom and open the windows again.

       I'm going to kill myself this summer  Not the way that anyone thinks, though. Practically the very opposite of how I normally would have gotten myself killed around a year ago. I'm getting ready for riding in 2 seperate 3 day long bike tours this summer. The first one is coming up at the end of this month. Called the GRABAAWR, it starts in Eagle River and goes all the way down to Prairie Du Chien. It follows the Wisconsin River for a full 7 days. It stops on the third day in Stevens Point, so I'm only going to ride until then. Still, each day is close to 70 miles of riding. I'm seriously pumped up for it.   Also, I may be going for a 3 day stint with my sister and her family in August for the SAGBRAW. That will go from Sturgeon Bay down to Port Washington and average around 40 miles a day. Both of these are fully detailed on  urlLink BikeWisconsin.org . I can't think of any of my friends at the moment who would even remotely think about doing this with me if I would ask them, so I'm not going to ask...but if any of you guys are interested, let me know. If I had someone to ride the whole GRABAAWR with...  So that is how I'm going to end up killing myself this summer. Death by excessive biking. It actually won't be all that bad. I'm already riding 30 miles each sunday and usually 15-20 miles 2-3 times a week on top of that. For all the bitching about Wisconsin Rapids that I do, I take back all of it during the summer months now. It does still suck during winter, though.  And that show about  urlLink returning to the Titanic  that was on last night on the National Geographic channel that they pumped up for the last 2 months totally sucked my left nut. Just an hour of a guy bitching about other people set their subs down on the wreck and taking shit back to the surface. If I want to hear someone bitch about stuff I'll call Sean. I don't need National Geographic for that.

       HDTV Gaming   Now  urlLink this is why  I bought my new video card. I'm glad someone else went through the trouble of finding all the right resolutions to run games 16:9 on a widescreen tv. I tried playing Unreal Tournament 2004 and Call of Duty already on my tv and while the picture was absolutely brilliant, it was always coming out stuck in 4:3. Now that I can get that fixed I believe it's time to get a good wireless keyboard and mouse (not a crappy Logitech set like I bougth last time to play emultated games on my tv, probably a high end Logitech set or even one of Microsoft's sets). Now I can't wait to get home tonight and play Call of Duty in widescreen at 1080i on a bigscreen tv.

       Gmail is creepy? Dude...you're an idiot.  Whoever wrote  urlLink this page  is a complete idiot. When you read over his " urlLink Gmail user profile " page, All I read was...Google blah, blah, blah, blah, my tin foil hat, blah, blah, blah, this guy is probably an employee at Yahoo!, blah, blah, blah.  This guy needs to be more worried about any potential goverment agencies tapping ISP's for their email traffic (remember  urlLink Carnivore ?) rather than focusing on how Google may be evil. For crying out loud, practically all your stupid email traffic is unencrypted when it goes over the wire. One little tap set on your ISP and people can read all your your unencrypted traffic. Stop pointing fingers at Google because you're just making yourself look stupid. Idiot.

      How to properly  urlLink interpret  the images on  urlLink Ready.gov 's  website. That Tom Ridge is a sick fuck, ain't he.  Stupid YMCA closing at 8pm now made it appear that I may have lost 2 racquetball games tonight. Bullshit! I only lost one. And that was a horrible loss since I was at 14 points for the longest time and couldn't finish the damn game off. We got called to stop our second match when it was 8-11 and I was on a roll to come back and win. Bullshit I say, bullshit! I'm way hot, tired, hungry and now whiney. I want it to be tuesday so I can order a 2 for one pizza deal thingy from Domino's and pig out all night. Tonight I feast on veggies. Where's that corn on the cob I have in the fridge...

       Worst...Parent...Ever   I am  ->|   | . Except her fucking louder than shit brats don't have shit for rhythm. I always give a good 10pm rule because they are kids and all, but seriously, I'm still trying to figure out what kind of parent (besides the bitch that lives upstairs from me) lets their kids stay up until 10pm running around and screaming. They're like 6 years old or so, I'm guessing. I remember being to bed around 8pm every night. Anyway, since I have some older people that live right next to me who can't hear very well (I'm guessing) and to the other side of me is guy-who-can't-park-his-car-worth-a-shit and smoke cigars in his aparatment with the door open like we're living in a college dormatory. I just figure that I'll turn up my subwoofer a little bit and turn on some nice deep  urlLink Orb .  *end rant*  I'm calling it a day otherwise.  I did a nice 20 mile ride through Biron with Alicia and Robert early this morning. That was a good starter for the day. Ate a nice sammich for lunch and then went out to a driving range with Robert. Now, this was my first time hitting a golf ball (not counting mini-golf) since high school. And I couldn't hit a ball to save my life back then. So I had Robert give me a quick tutorial on how to hold the club properly and stance and shit. Just enough so I could attempt to hit the ball. After a few flubs I actually got the hold of it a little bit. Although every club I hit with went the same distance, it was still out around 150 yards or so. Most went pretty straight, too. I couldn't get a good feel for using the driver, though. I wanted to just whack the shit out of the ball but every time I tried to wail on it, I ended up either topping the ball and watching it dribble in front of me or else I would pop it straight up into the air. I think my longest drive was around 250 yards after the ball stopped rolling. I'll take that for my first time out and seriously trying to hit the ball. So I'm ready to go golfing for real now. I'll have to try to get Jeffy to come out and hit the cheap-o course here in town with me. Actually, we should have a weekend where Jeffy, Timmy, Sean, Craig, and who every else wants to go golfing should come up. Maybe do it the weekend of the pontoon trip.  Next up on my list of things to accomplish today was a little fishing. I had gotten a call right before heading out to the driving range from Dean seeing if I was going out. So I headed down to the river and gave Dean a ring. Pretty much I had a horrible stint while Dean caught 2 or 3. I don't remember exactly. I did catch a pretty nice 4lb.-ish bass before he showed up, but that didn't make up for losing my favorite  urlLink Rapala .   If Sunday's turn out nice then I like to get around 30 miles in on my bike, so I headed back out through Port Edwards for another 10 mile ride. I had wanted to go all the way through Nekoosa, but that was going to be another 20 mile ride or so, and it was already 7:30pm, so I decided to cut it short. Trying to delay heading home, I detoured around to Dairy Queen and grabbed a tasty Heath bar blizzard. (Digging around Dairy Queen's site I noticed that they use ASP.NET and haven't turned off their error messages (clicking through their menu in a certain way will produce an exception). And they don't test very well. Idiots.) Anyway I got close to my 30 miles and now am waiting for the blizzard to get through my system so I can grill up some of those italian sausages for dinner. Then I'm going to be so ready for a quick shower and bed.   As you can see, I'm back in my blogging mood again.

       Bah  I haven't been in the mood to write recently. Not grumpy or anything, just not in a writing mood. Nothing real exiting going on recently either. And bananaphone has offically be evacuated from my head thanks to repeated listening of The Orb.  Thank you very much Dr. Paterson!  I think I'm going to try playing a little of Thief 3, but I have a feeling that my attention span is going to be extremely low and in a matter of a few minutes I'll shut it off and just read some news sites until I'm ready for bed.

       The surprise of the night  I haven't finished watching it yet, but Bubba Ho-tep ended up being a let down. I didn't finish it last night because I got too tired after watching  urlLink Eurotrip  first, which, to my surprise, was actually quite funny. Other than that, last night was same old go to the Y to work out, then come home, eat until tired and then go to bed. I did get up at 6am today all wide awake and shit for no reason. I was going to just get up and suck down some orange juice and then go back to bed until 7, but I ended up saying fuck it and just hopped on the computer to get my news in nice and early. Today looks to be another overcast/possibly rainy day. I'm getting sick of rain.

       I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty.   Kerry's speech tonight was quite good. I really wasn't sure what to expect before hand, but he was quite captivating for the whole 45 minutes. I like his plan and I like his   ...hold on...C-Span is on and I just heard a republican party supporter say that he thinks liberals are taking the constitution to the extreme. Taking the constitution to the extreme!?! WTF!? Has the Bush administration gotten people to actually believe that the constitution is just a mere suggestion of how this country should be run? I guess it only becomes legal doctrine when you want to keep those 3 automatic rifles and 2 semi-automatic shotguns at home because it's your constitutional right.   Seriously. How do people come to these fucked up realizations. Oh, he also said that the democrats all hate religion, too. Which I'm going to guess he means that he's a Christian and since Christianity is the only true religion, that not pushing Christianity to the forefront doesn't mean that you are accepting of all religions, but that you are weak, and evil, and most likely going to hell. Ok dumbass...this is how the country needs to be run...are you ready? Religion is separated from state. Got it? Now, we're a melting pot of all sorts of people here. That mean different religions. Do you remember the 1st Amendment? That doesn't mean the freedom for all Americans to only be practicing Christians, it means that everyone is free to practice their own religion without persecution. Unless you're some dumbfuck cult like those comet & kool-aid loving motherfuckers, but they usually take care of themselves in the end. Anyway, it's the morals that we follow and believe in that ultimately matter, not the church to which you give a tenth of every paycheck. When your religion comes before the good of all Americans, then you are not only being grossly self-righteous, but you are also acting as a very poor example of why being an American is the greatest thing in the world.  And if I hear one more person say that if you don't back the war in Iraq, that you are for the terrorists or you can just leave the country...well, those few loud voices make me incredibly sad. It just screams ignorance and I haven't seen as much ignorance in my whole life as I have seen these past few years.  end political rant...  Anyway Kerry's speech was excellent. I have no issues with his proposed plans or the other few issues he brought up as small bits (like stem cell research). I wish I would have watched more of the convention, but when it's so damn nice out, I need to be outside instead of in front of the tv.  I think I'll be biking with one of the guys from work on a 80 mile ride this saturday. I wasn't going to do it with my bike, but he said that he knows someone that I can borrow a good road bike from, so if that pans out, then I'm definitely going to ride. It'll be a great warm up to SAGBRAW. And the longest ride in a day that I've ever done (Currently at around 70 miles). So I may end up going for an extra 20 that evening just to get a century in. Which will be pretty damn good if I do it as a century still sounds pretty damn intimidating. And I've only started really riding this spring/summer.  Almost forgot...I need to get my top 10 for the week up...Going to have to grab a beer and chalk up something here...

       20 days between workouts kills   I was suppose to play racquetball with Robert from work tonight, but he didn't show up (ah-hem) so I just went into the weight room instead. It's been 20 days since I last was in there, mainly due to wanting to be outside after work and out biking instead of sitting inside for the few hours of sun that I can get during the week, so I was a little bit out of balance coming from going there twice a week. But I made it through without puking or passing out and now I just want to have a beer and pass out in front of the tv watching a movie.  urlLink Hellboy  tonight (thanks, Dean).  I got my new biking jerseys, shorts, and arm warmers today. They all fit nice and now I finally have a nice set of jerseys and shorts to keep a consistent black/gray and white motif, if you will. Everything fits sweet so now all I need is that  urlLink fancy new road bike  to go with the fancy clothes. If anyone would like to donate that bike to me, I will gladly take it in the name of charity. And if you are a nutty right-wing Christian, then you'll secure a place for yourself in heaven by doing so.  I would be listening to iTunes right now, but my  urlLink favorite little program  is running in the background and sucking up all my processing cycles.

       O'Reilly gets pwned!   Just finished watching Michael Moore on The O'Reilly Factor and basically had O'Reilly say that he didn't believe in the war in Iraq enough that he wouldn't send his own child to fight. That we did go to war on false pretenses and, well..whoops, our bad that your kids are dying over there. This war was fought by mistake, but it's still worth your children's lives because Iraq is a direct terrorist threat to our nation, not Bin Laden. And then he had to still add his own little 'spin' (I hate that fucking word) on the interview after the segment was over so that he could get his last punch in without Moore around. Very poor form. A real journalist would have let the segment speak for itself.  On another note. I got my speakers/DVD player that I ordered from  urlLink Woot! . Everything came yesterday and although the shipping boxes were a little beat up, everything inside them was perfect. I got it hooked up and watch a movie last night and it works perfectly fine. Now I just have to figure out a way to rearrange my living room again to get everything to fit just a bit better. As of now, the DVD player that came with the set is the only way I can use the speakers for 5.1 digital. And the RCA cables that came with the set were so damn short that I have the player sitting on the ground in front of the sub right now. Angie seems to think it's a fancy new spot to lay down on, so I need to move it off the floor before it gets clogged with cat hair.    I get my new biking jerseys and shorts tomorrow for SAGBRAW. It'll be nice to have more than 2 jerseys and only 1 pair of shorts to ride with. One of the guys at work is planning two seperate 80 mile rides this saturday and I'm debating whether or not to ride one of them. He says he's planning on keeping around a constant 16mph on the rides and I don't think I'm capable of that on my crappy hybrid bike. I'd have to get a hold of a good road bike before I could hold that average speed for even 40 miles. straight.  Howard Dean's speaking now, so that's it from me tonight. Time to watch all the fun political stuff some more.

       Putts For Pets   Golfing tonight was a ton of fun. It was only my second time out actually golfing, but I had a blast. My fucking wrist hurts like hell from the first time I golfed, but other than that it was great. I sucked most of the time, but my putts were all close and I managed to actually tee off and hit my ball somehow perfectly parallel to me on one hole. I also had about a three shot in a row record of hitting trees every time. One tee off gave me 2 trees in one hit, so that was cool (lost my fucking ball that hit too). It was nice having someone who knew how to golf on our team as the rest of us really sucked. I was hoping to learn a thing or two, but instead I learned that buying only one raffle ticket out of 100 some people won't win you shit. I'm waiting on Robert's knife set review... What did I learn? I need to go out golfing more for practice because I know I can hit better than I did tonight. Otherwise, I need to get to be like I'm not doing right now because I suck as sleeping, too. Fuck, it's time for bed!

       Lots of stuff going on today   So tomorrow is Putts For Pets. A 4 man scramble golf tournament thing for the local humane society. This will only be my second time ever golfing. I did go to the driving range again after work and perfect my slice a little more for tomorrow. I also had a first today...I bought golf balls. Speaking of golf, I think for those few of us who want to go golfing sometime this summer, I'm thinking about seeing if everyone can do it the last weekend in August (28-29th) Probably Saturday evening or early Sunday. Here's who I have interested so far: Yoshi, Sean, Jeffy, Timmy, Craig, and possibly Jimmi J. That would make a nice group of retarded golfers to go out and have a fun time running around a cheap course with golf carts and beer. I'll send out emails this weekend to everyone to see if that weekend works out. And if anyone else is interested and I fogot about asking you, send me an email (Ward?).  I got a hold of the first two disks of the second season of Six Feet Under. I only have them for one day so they are going to be dumped on my hard drive for later viewing. Good stuff, I'm going to start the first disk watching in about 10 minutes.  I got my Fedex tracking number from my order on  urlLink Woot! . So I'm feeling a lot better about it now. I already read on their forums that some people have already gotten their packages. I should be getting mine by Monday and I'll finally have a nice digital surround sound system in my living room.  I'm off to watch Six Feet Under...finally!

       Woot!   Ok, I'm not sure if  urlLink Woot!  is a fully legit site or not, but they advertise on  urlLink Engadget . They had serious kick ass deals every other day or so. I bought the surround sound system they had advertised the other day for less than 100 bucks brand new. They retail for more than double that everywhere else I've seen on the 'net. I'll let you all know if I actually receive it or if I just end up having some guy come over to my apartment and personally shove his cock up my ass with no complimentary lube. Anyway, maybe you'll see something you like and take a chance before I can tell you it's legit. If I get that 650 watt digital surround sound system (including progressive scan DVD player) then I'll make sure to let every one on here know. And that fucker better come because I haven't had a stereo system hooked up to my main tv in over 2 years because I couldn't fit my old speakers in the living room.

       Furr^H^Hnny Halo Cartoon   I decided to spend some of the time tonight, while my hair is scorching itself to what appears to be a light orange color, looking up some news on  urlLink Halo 2 . I ran across this site where a chick draws these comics with furries in Halo settings. Anyway, anyone who plays XBox Halo in Co-op mode will get this comic right away. Many times have I played the part of the respawn bitch...  urlLink Click me fucker   Here's her page with all her Halo cartoons. Yes, they're all furries, but whatever gets you or your loved ones off is none of my business. I'm just being nice and linking the source.  urlLink Click me fucker

       It's about that time   I've been good way too long. I think I'm going to pull an Eminem sometime this week. And it's too late to back out I already bought the goods. Now we should all laugh at Fred because he has carpeting in his kitchen and jerks off to Twi'Leks who look like Martha Stewert.  Now where's my pizza, bitch!!?! Damn lazy ass cat...

       Pontoon Trip   Pontoon trip is done for the year and it was just as good as the previous years and I finally managed to evade a nasty sunburn by strategically tanning a month in advance instead of going out and sitting on the water for 8 hours white as a ghost. I guess the weather could have been a little bit warmer yesterday, but overall it was great. A few pictures I took on my phone are up on  urlLink mobscene   Gash had come up last Thursday and we had gone out to a few bars in town here to play some pool. We eventually ended up at The Bar down by the river, which I had never been to before, and it was pretty nice. We also ate the Cancun Restaurant, some mexican restaurant that opened not too long ago, and it was alright, but not good enough for the price.  Tim and Sean came into town on Friday afternoon and we hit the river for a little fishing until around 6pm and then went over to Shaw Lee's for dinner. They had their seafood buffet, which I had never had before, so we all dug in except for Gash who just ate noodles of course. They had some squid there and I had just watched a show a short time ago about the different ways people eat squid over in Japan, so I thought "what the fuck, let's try it" and slapped a big helping of tentacles and whatever else was in that dish on my plate. It wasn't all that bad. The tentacles are really chewy, like rubber and it's a little disturbing at first when your chewing on it and you can feel all the little suction cups on your tongue. I still won't eat oysters, but I'll eat squid (cooked) again any day. That night we went out to Johnny's for a while and eventually went into Point to few bars before heading back to Rapids just before bar time.  Another first, I was the first one up Saturday morning trying to get Sean's ass up off the couch so we could get to Waupaca on time. So, we ended up getting into town about a half hour late. Anyway, breakfast a the local truck stop was great and then we headed to Ding's Docks and waiting for the crowd to show up. I believe it was still around 25 people showing up on two boats. Lots of beer, lots of really white people in the morning and lots of really red people at the end of the day. No one shit off the side of the boat again this year, but we did get an impromptu and relatively boring porn show.  Most everyone headed up to Green Bay last night after getting back off the lake, but I just headed back home or else I'd have to truck my ass way back to Rapids instead of driving only the 40 miles from Waupaca. I figured that one quick night out in GB wasn't going to be worth it since I knew I was going to be dead tired come 10pm. Instead I ordered some pizza from Domino's and sat to watch some  urlLink dumb movie  that I was hoping was going to be cool and instead helped me fall asleep. Today's still damn nice out, so it's going to be a great biking day only I think I'm going to stay covered until my skin calms down a little bit and the bits of red turn brown.

       Damn this insomnia!   Well, I'm kinda bored again so I'm going to start off the first iteration of my very own "Top 10". I'll put up a top 10 of something every week and then let everyone bitch about how I'm retarded and how number 5 should really be number 1 or some stupid shit like that. Well, this week I'll start off with the top 10 hottest women celebs. Feel free to add your own remix. This was a toughy, but I pulled it off (huh huh...I said pulled off). Without further adieu, my first Top 10 list. Sorry to anyone with dial-up. Pictures plucked from other sites.

       Long weekend   Ok, so I finally got my posters to Appleton to a proper Ben Franklin Crafts store so I could use a 50% off coupon on custom framing. So I won't be paying $300 to get my 2 posters framed properly. Nice. The way to Appleton is all fucked up now, though. Highway 10 now bypasses Appleton instead of coming in right by the Fox River Mall and Best Buy. This totally fucked me up and ended up heading towards Manitowac and finding a turnoff that said it headed to downtown Appleton. After one or two more miscues, I was back on track to the mall. Now I was only going on about 10% guesstimation that the Ben Franklin was near the mall. I was pretty sure I had seen it there, but I wouldn't have bet any money on it. As luck would turn out, I was right. So anyway, after dropping off the posters (frickin' 5 weeks before they're done), I checked out the Home Decor store next door and wished I had a house to buy cool furniture for once, then continued onto the mall to do a little shopping. I wish Gash was along because I would have killed him by going into practically every clothing store and trying shit on. I would say I was in the mall around 3-4 hours. I got a nice pair of jeans, a cool shirt and cheap pair of sunglasses for biking (still not as cheap as the ones I had bought at Big Lots, though).   So after I got back to Rapids, it was still really fucking nice out, too late to really go biking though, so I went down to Wazeecha to sit and try to get a little bit of sun before it went down. The night was filled with WWII crap as I spent the rest of the evening watching some of  urlLink Band of Brothers  and then getting into the mood to play a little  urlLink Call of Duty .  I was hoping Sunday was going to be sunny, too, but instead it was overcast and sprinkled now and again. I went out biking with Alicia right after lunch and then contemplated whether or not to go see Anchorman. Then Dean stopped by to let me know that a couple of people were going to be playing some  urlLink Unreal Tournament 2k4  so I figured that doing that would be just as fun and cheaper, so I headed out for some gaming instead.  Today was a plain bland monday for the most part. I had to book it after work to get up to Wausau and get my car's oil changed. As always, I had to call and tell them I was running late. I still don't get how that works, I leave like 50 minutes ahead of time and I'm always late even though it's only like 50 miles away...65 MPH most of the way. So I got that done and ran over to Best Buy to get a few more of my favorite clear, slim, dvd cases. Then checked out the Barnes and Nobles. Nothing purchased there, though. So now I'm home and deciding what the hell I'm going to do to entertain myself now until midnight or so. Somehow I think I've developed ADD over the years.

       Apple's 100 million songs contest   Apple has a pretty cool contest going on where they give away a 20gig iPod every 100,000 song downloaded from 95 million to 100 million. Normally I wouldn't care too much since I don't want to buy a shit load of songs off of iTunes just to possibly win an iPod when I could just throw out the cash to buy one instead, but if you look on  urlLink the page with the 100 million songs countdown , at the bottom in the fine print, it tells you how you can enter for free using the "tell a friend" links within the iTunes music store.  urlLink See here  for a better explanation.  So anyway, I just sat at my computer like a complete nerd and sent off these "tell a friend" emails to apple for like the last half hour as the counter just went over the 98,300,000 mark. Will I win the iPod? Not a fucking chance. Why did I do it? Because I'm a stupid fuck.

       ...now watch this drive.   As I feel that  urlLink Requiem for a Dream  should be required watching for high school children for an great anti-drug campaign, everyone should see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  to get a few more facts on our current White House squatter before we all go voting this November. Excellent documentary and way better than Spider-Fucking-Man 2 (what a waste of money that was). So what I am basically saying is, I just watched Fahrenheit 9/11 and it was great. Go see it, or download it since I guess Moore has no issues with people getting it off the internet. I truly can't see where people can watch this documentary and play off the whole thing like it's all a fabrication.   And what the fuck!?! I just wrote a whole bunch more but it got erased. Well fuck that. I'm not writing it again right now. Just go watch it.

       One hot 16 year old chick   urlLink This story  on CNet had me chuckling for a while.    Witnesses to the latest mishap said the 16-year-old girl had the phone in her back pocket, when her phone let out a whoosh, bulged, then shot out flames and smoke. She was treated for second-degree burns at an area hospital and released shortly afterwards.   Wow, She'll probably have permanent scar on her ass cheek in the shape of her cell phone now. Like that guy's hand from Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Guys will be all over that when she's in college.   When it happened, I bet all her friends with her were totally jealous of her cool new fireball ringer until they realized that their friend's ass was being charred in the process.

       My posters have come in   My  urlLink Kill Bill  posters are sitting at the post office waiting for me to pick them up. I went to one place in Point (Ben Franklin) to see how much it would cost to frame them (not a cheap frame, I want glass and metal) and it came out to about $160 per poster. And I want at least the Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 posters framed. Does anyone know somewhere to buy the framing materials cheap or even someone who I could maybe get a deal from? I don't have the exact sizes, but they are around 27x40 and I don't need matting. If anyone knows where I could either get them framed or buy all the materials to do it myself for under $100 each, it would be greatly appreciated.

       Doom 3 Tweak Guide   Ok, so their actual guide for tweaking Doom 3 wasn't much help as you'll want to keep all the special effects turned on, but the Windows XP guide at the beginning has boosted my overall PC's performance along with Doom 3 a whole shitload. Like my iTunes doesn't majorly stutter anymore every time I try to open another application and the sound in Doom 3 isn't choppy anymore and it doesn't have the 3 second screen jerk that I was forcing myself to get use to.

       Yup   Just wanted to verify before I head to bed, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the best movie ever made. Ok, so maybe Fight Club is the best movie ever made, but if you put both the Kill Bill movies together as they should be, they are the best movie ever made. I, for one, will be watching both volumes back to back this weekend and those who would like to can join me.   I need a bigger TV...

       PC in an ugly green ball   This somewhat reminds me of my ingenious idea of  PC in a Bag . Instead of a tower (or in this case, an ugly green ball), the guts of the PC would just be tossed into a sack of some kind with holes for the wires to stick out of. It would be great for lan parties because all you would need to do is grab the top of the bag and sling it over your shoulder and when you get there, just plop it down somewhere out of the way. And you could totally mod it by ironing on or sewing patches to the bag or even buying different bags for whatever mood you're in at the moment and would like to reflect with your  PC in a Bag . The prototype I was working on didn't work very long as it kept melting the garbage bags I was using and would short out the mobo. It also didn't want to turn back on after being slung over your shoulder and carried around for a while.  I'm sure once I get all the kinks worked out it'll be a hit with the PC enthusiast crowd.  urlLink Click me fucker

       Coolest Doom 3 mod so far   Swapping between your flashlight and gun in Doom 3 is almost a chore in itself, but it looks like someone made a mod to attach a flashlight at the end of your gun barrel (much coolness) and then somebody went and updated it to splash up a picture of Hello Kitty (the devil) or the Thundercats logo and some other silly things.   And I finally got one good scare from Doom 3 last night when I was just minding my own business picking up armor shards and when I turned around there was a nice big nasty sitting right there being all quiet and shit just to scare me. That prick. Then I fell down a pit by accident and I quit for the night.  Good story, huh?   urlLink Click me fucker

       Ohhhh!!! My new modem!   I almost forgot. I finally got a new cable modem today at Circuit City. Only $40 for the latest Motorola after rebate shit. I use to hate Circuit City, but now that Best Buy has their floor people bother the shit out of you, I hate going into that store to do my usual browse at my own leisure and somehow end up leaving with a hundred bucks worth of shit I never intended on buying in the first place. Well, Circuit City gets my money now in GB at least. I know the sales people at BB are told to harass the customers, but damn it I hate those fuckers when they come hovering around you the second you step into their section of the store. As Craig put it, what are you going to do? Start looking through the cds with me?   Anyway, tomorrow I get the new modem hooked up, get rid of that extra rental fee, and juice my service back up to 3megs. Happy happy fast internet days again!

       Back From SAGBRAW   Ok, I'm back from my  urlLink second biking vacation  this summer. I think I'm going to be pouty again for awhile like I was after GRABAAWR, too. The ride was awesome. It was beautiful each day and riding along Lake Michigan on a bike instead of a car is so much prettier since you actually have the time to enjoy it. And the nice brisk mornings weren't all that bad thanks to the nice arm warmers I had picked up a week before leaving.  I think I managed to get another shade tanner, but now my bike-geek-shorts tan line really sticks out like a sore thumb. Since I only started on day 4 in Sturgeon Bay, the daily rides were 67 miles, 47 miles, and 62 miles. That first ride from Sturgeon Bay to Algoma was actually only a 27 mile ride which by itself is something I can easily ride around here and wouldn't be worth the money for the day of riding. So I opted for the extra 40 miles around the  urlLink windfarms . Pretty cool ride, but there weren't any real hills to climb until the last 10 miles and by that time I was getting sick of riding into a heavy headwind while hitting hill after hill. Normally I don't mind a nice climb every now and again, but fuck...there were like 10 hills in a row right at the end. Needless to say, my naptime after getting back and showering was much needed. Probably one of the best naps I've ever taken.  Second day I rode along with my sister and her family. We rode a little slower because of my nephew riding on the back of a tandem and my niece in a burly. But it was a nice easy ride after the long ride the day before. I did get a chance to sprint with my sister for a little while which was nice, too.  Yesterday I rode by myself again so I could get some good speed going. I made the 62 miles in around 4 hours 15 minutes. Average speed of 15mph. I also was averaging around 12mph on climbs which was much better than 8mph or so during GRABAAWR, so my legs are getting a little stronger. I rode along with a few different groups of people this day. The last 10 miles were really nice when I rode behind two guys on mountain/hybrid bikes going about 18mph. Being able to hold that kind of pace for 10 miles on a shitty hybrid wasn't all that bad in my mind. And the nice cold beer at the end made the ride even better. I got some pictures from the ride that I took with my cameraphone up on  urlLink mobscene .  Now I'm going to shower, put on my pjs and play some gaddam Doom 3 for a few hours before crashing out and getting myself prepped for work again tomorrow.

       Damn that Martian Buddy!   Tonight is the only night I'll be able to play Doom 3 before leaving on my bike vacation thingy, and they are making me save my game and to to  urlLink www.martianbuddy.com  to get a code that I need to use on a storage container. This container better has a plasma rifle in it...  But so far Doom 3 kicks ass. I just ran into one of the big doggies and it proceeded to kick my ass until I realized that they only take about 4 shotgun shells to take one down. I'm getting use to my box taking about 10 seconds to get back up to speed after every save and the minute to get up to speed at the beginning of each level. I'm running it at 10x7 now instead of 8x6 and it looks sooo much better and isn't running all that much slower than 8x6. I'll probably be upgrading to a mid-range system around this christmas when the Athalon 64 bit procs. go down in price some more. I'd like to get a 3200+ 64 bit proc with 512 of 3200 DDR for under $200. We'll see if it will happen around November/December.  Anyway, Angie needs some attention and then I'm going to see what's in my Martian Buddy cabinet. Like I said, it better be at least a plasma rifle.

       Won a RoboSapien from Woot!   Just took a look at  urlLink Engadget  and noticed my name as the latest winner of a  urlLink RoboSapien  from Woot!'s giveaway. I haven't heard anything back about winning the Kensington mouse and Splinter Cell package, so I don't know about actually getting this either, but I did buy that surround sound system from them and it works great. So I can't say anything bad about them because I did get what I payed money for and that's what matters. If I do get the robot thing, I'll have to bring it into work because it probably won't get used much at home.
