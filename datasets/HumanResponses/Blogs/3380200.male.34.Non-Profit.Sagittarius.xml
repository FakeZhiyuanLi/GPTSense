      So, whilst devouring an entire Jack's Supreme Pizza for dinner, I watched me a little 700 Club.  It was most interesting.  There was a story about how the horrendous and evil LIBERALS were editing the holiest and divine creation that are GOD'S children's textbooks, thereby leading them down the path of SATAN!!!!  Evidence cited was the teaching of a multi-cultural foundation for America, namely Native American (RED and SATAN), West African(BLACK AND SATAN) and European (WHITE, DIVINE, HOLY, oh LORD bless them!!!).  Pat Robertson stated that new textbooks teach this awful and evil mix to students thereby lessening the full impact of England and WHITE people.  A mongrel America, dedicated to SATAN and SATANIC pursuits!  There is no more an ability for one to say it loud and proud that the LORD IS MY SAVIOR!!, vomited Robertson.  Our children can no longer criticize religions or individuals that demean women! (ISLAM, Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and George W. Bush), he belched.  (This being most ridiculous since Pat Robertson and his ilk advocate disallowing a woman the right to choose what to do with her own body.)  The way the man spoke with his eyes closed, the very righteousness of his words!  I had to turn it off lest you, dear reader, begin to be subjected to the word of a true American, WHITE and of ENGLISH descent.  Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick...

      Once we stop denying death, we can proceed calmly to die and then go on to experience uterine rebirth or Judeo-Christian afterlife or out-of-body experience or a trip on a UFO.        -Don DeLillo "White Noise"  This is more of a test blog.  It seems that blogspot is trying to make me mad by not posting what I write when I want it to.  A friend of mine recommended that I write this b.s. out in Word first and then cut & paste.  I shall follow that advice for now.

      So I was reading this article:  urlLink https://www.gopusa.com/commentary/lchavez/2004/lc_0520.shtml   (sorry, I don't know how to properly link yet, but have patience, I'M LEARNIN'!)  This Linda Chavez is an interesting woman.  I suspect that I'll be having lots of fun with these people over at GOPUSA.  Here's my comments that I posted to their website:      I have one question for Ms. Linda Chavez regarding her article entitled "Media Downplays the Discovery of WMD in Iraq".  First of all, let's look at what W.M.D. stands for.  It stands for WEAPONS of MASS DESTRUCTION.  The first word is weapons.  That's plural meaning more than one.  How many were found?  Answer: one.  The second word is mass.  Mass implies large numbers as in masses, as in hundreds, shoot, I'll give her the benefit of the doubt, let's say three.  How many masses were affected?  Answer: 0.  This brings the astute reader to the third word, destruction.  How many masses or how much property was rendered dead or useless?  Answer: 0.  The weapon contained 3-4 litres of sarin.  I would like Ms. Chavez to answer the last question.  During the 237 times that W and his administration, namely Colin Powell, Dick Rumsfeld, Condoleeza Rice and Dick Cheney lied to the American people and the world about WMDs, how much sarin did they say that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed?  I'll give you a quarter for the right answer.   I wait with baited breathe.   I'll let you know what response, if any, I receive.

      So I watched me some Kill Bill Vol. 1.  I will begin by saying me and Kill Bill Vol. 2 will not be going out together.  I was seriously disappointed.  And to paraphrase a line from the mover, Lucy Liu is a silly Asian girl who likes to play at acting.  I mean seriously folks, the girl sucked it on that god-awful Ally McBeal, you remember, the show with that chica that dated Harrison Ford.  For all of his manly action hero antics, that boy needed to feed ol' girl a burger, maybe seven, I dunno.  Anyhoo, I was looking forward to some witty dialogue ala Pulp Fiction, but that shit wasn't happening!  I mean the part where Bleep and Liu's character do the exchange "Silly Rabbit blah blah blah", you know the rest.  I cringed.  Oy.  I guess it was supposed to be a cartoon-like expose paying homage to all of those martial arts films that I devoured on Saturday afternoons as a kid that played on WUAB Channel 43 Lorrain/Cleveland, but I was yawning.  Those fake blood fountains weren't clever, they were coma inducing.    Kill Bill Vol. 1 overall poop rating - 1 1/2.

      Well, I decided to enter the world of blogging. It seems that many blogs are kinda like road rage incidents. You read 'em, and you know damn well that if you met that person in the real world, they may not have the balls to rant and bullshit and generally just preach to your face, or cut you off in their haste to make that right turn so they can get to the gas pump and lay out $50 bucks to fill the tank of their obnoxious SUV. The soap box can be a bully pulpit, but there is the safety of anonymity. Plus, many in my peer group are doing it, and I figured if they can do it, then so can your humble narrator.   Several items that you may read here in the future are taken from selected volumes of the speeches I have published after being delivered at various V.F.W. halls around the country. I am usually paid one twelve pack of whatever the local beer is in any given locale, for I feel it's necessary to avoid patronizing the evil mega-corporations that have taken over nearly every aspect of our society. (much on this subject to come in the future, believe it dear reader) Enough for now, it's time for some Kill Bill Vol. 1. And I'll review the various films that I see, assigning them ratings based on a time-tested poop system.

      I've lately become aware of, and obsessed with, this show called Scarborough Country.  It's on MSNBC every night at 9:00 pm.  It's one of the channels that Comcast has forgotten to scramble since I disavowed their heinous and insidious service.  I digress.  Anyway, you may have seen the show.  The opening montage depicts scenes from a perfect midwestern existence.  Children (white children) playing in their yards, folks (white folks) laughing and waving, people (white people) happily at their jobs. Then the host, Joe Scarborough (a black man? you guess, a Latino?) in overalls, on the farm.  The only people of color you see are in the background, sweaty and dirty, doing the weed-whackin' or hanging the laundry.  (Just joshin')  Last night, he had on Ann Coulter.  Ann Coulter.  Say it again.  Ann Coulter.  The name, to me, has become synonymous with hate-mongering and ignorance.  The funny thing is, is that I believe that this witch knows that the shit she spews from her pie-hole is bullshit.  She's getting paid.  She's smart enough to know that there is an audience that agrees with what she says, and she stares down her considerable WASP nose at them with utter contempt.  I sincerely believe that Ms. Coulter is laughing all of the way to the bank.  I mean, some of the stuff that she writes is beyond rationale and comprehension.  Liberals hate America?  The terrorists should have blown up the New York Times?  She's just inciting book sales.  Period.  So she's on the show.  They start discussing Clinton's new book, My Life.  They have on Al Gore's former campaign manager, a Mr. Lehane, to be the token-left-side viewpoint.  Whenever Mr. Lehane tries to make a point, he is shouted down by Scarborough.  Whenever Coulter goes on a rant about Monica Lewinsky being the only legacy of Bubba's presidency, she is allowed to continue and given obvious approval by the host, Scarborough.  It is appalling.  It makes the blood boil.  Then there are the constant references to the "elite" press by Scarborough.  I guess I should stop watching.  Jeez, I'm sorry, I'm gonna shut up now.

      A friend of a friend was killed trying to catch the bus to work on Sunday afternoon.  She was run-over during the Puerto Rican "independence" celebrations during which people clog the streets to drive like maniacs, with huge flags flying and their babies hanging out of mini-van sliding doors, for several days every June.  While she lay in the street, someone stole her purse.  She died alone and anonymous in the hospital.  As of this writing, no witnesses have come forward.    American Independence Day is coming up, as well.  During these celebrations, people will stand in the street and unleash a shock and awe style of professional and amateur fireworks upon the neighborhood.  There will be young children running all over, with no adult supervision, and in all likelihood, I will be a drunken and full participant in the festivities.  Last year I nearly lost my left index finger.  Maybe I'll think more about the danger to myself and those around me this year.  I doubt it, however.    The friend of a friend is now independent of this disturbing callousness and apathy.

      In reference to my earlier writing, I found this most succinct and wonderful of quotes.    Strange as it seems, no amount of learning can cure stupidity, and formal education positively fortifies it.           -Stephen Vizinczey  I'd say the ol' boy pretty much hit the nail on the head!

      I am at work.  It's not really work.  A primate of lesser standing in the world than homo sapiens could practically do this work.  Why do people have to be so hostile and defensive on the phone when you ask them to do something that is their job?  Why do some people know more about my job than I do, despite never having done my job?  Why are there people with master's degrees who cannot read or write?  These things I ponder as I sit in my cube.  Oh, time to gopher!  It's nothing.  Sit down, get back to work...

      I was just listening to some Cash and I was thinking about how that's a way of life and a culture that is lost and dead now.  I am proud to say that my family and my experience is tied to that culture.  My grandfather was a good man, he was a hog farmer and he owned a lumber yard in north west Ohio.  He was a man that was often taken advantage of because of his kindness.  He graduated from the same college that I graduated from, and then he went to the asian theater to fight in WWII.  He was a captain that commanded "negro" troops.  It always mistified me, because he was a racist person and he never learned anything from the troops he commanded.  Despite that, he was still one of the best friends that I've ever had.  I used to eat lunch with him every Sunday while I was in college.  Toward the end of his life, he met this horrendous redneck bitch named Kathy.  She bled him dry because he was lonely.  I often feel guilty because I never told him to stay away from her.  My mother hates her still.  I watched him die one night in November of 1993.  I will never forget the look on his face as he looked at me.  That's what one always needs to remember, your family is the most important thing in your life.  It doesn't matter what a fuck you may be, or what you've done, you can always go home.  Peace.  I'm out.

      Sonic Youth's new album, Sonic Nurse, came out a coupla days ago.  I went and picked up a copy at the Tower Records.  The Tower Records has the best library in town.  Everything from publications that give advice on how to grow the best organic chard on your back porch in the midst of a smog-infested metropolis to great bondage mags are there.    My ol' lady is watching some motivational speaker on the tube.  I told her I was a bloggin'.  She mentioned that blogs are just everything that crosses a person's mind all the time and hinted that she doesn't see the purpose.  I said that that was exactly the point.  It's just a mental poop, I suppose.  But's it's there to review for later...  Anyway, the Sonic Nurse album is kick-ass.  I highly recommend it.  I guess I could use the Patented-Time-Tested Poop system on albums.  Why not.  4 big poops!  Yep.  That's right.

      Today is Friday.  It is a beautiful day.  I just went and visited a friend's candy store.  It is called Sucker's Candy Shop and it is on Damen Ave. just north of Belmont on the west side of the street.  I highly recommend that you get your ass over there and buy some candy.  Tammy needs the money.

      4 poops - ecstasy of defecation  3 poops - a few exra wipes may be needed, but overall, a satisfying rectal experience  2 poops - starting to get a little shafty here, maybe you got the runs from what was up there on the screen  1 poop - it's shit, but somewhat watchable, you're stuck with a shafty ass that just won't wipe clean  flatulent - sucked, stay away, don't wave it over here, one will be required to fashion a gas mask by pulling one's shirt up to cover nose and mouth  I would like to thank Mr. Dannydoom over at www.dannydoom.net for his cooperation in the creation of the Time Tested Poop Rating System.  Many hours were logged on various toilets around Chicago devising the Time Tested Poop Rating System.

      I watched the Fog of War today. I found it to be an exellent and extremely disturbing film given our current war in Iraq.  George W. Bush, I implore you, watch this film.  We're not talking about preparing for a trip to England by watching such Hollywood fluff as Master and Commander, here.  You may actually learn something.  A truly frightening thought:  W has the power to launch all of our nuclear weapons.  The decision is his and his alone.  The man who is by his own admission anti-intellectual, only reads headlines, sees millions of people protesting his decisions as a focus group and cannot speak in public still controls all of that weaponry.  W would rather fuck himself in the ass with Saddam's pistol, than debate and analyse a situation from all points of view.    Something else that really struck me, McNamara said that without the support of other countries who shared similar ideologies with the U.S.A., the Vietnam war was doomed from the start.  Sound familiar?  There is so much to be said about the film.  McNamara's ten lessons and the eleven lessons from the film are a lot to chew on, but oh so simple.  Another bonus was the soundtrack by Phillip Glass.  I like his compositions.  Overall poop rating - 4 poops.

      So, I just returned from Manzanillo, Colima in Mexico, a town whose claim to fame is that the cinema masterpiece that is "10" starring Bo Derek and Dudley Moore was shot there.  (Poop rating - 1 Poop.)  The trip was everything I'd hoped it would be and more.  It was hot, dry, sunny, sandy, fishy, tasty, sexy, filthy, impoverished, wealthy, boozy, wet, fun as hell and most importantly, very enlightening.  My group was pretty much the only gringos I saw and after Saturday, we had the resort mostly to ourselves.  June is the start of the rainy season there and many of the hotel staff were laid off on May 31.  There is no Memorial Day in Mexico, so it was off to home and back to work for the vacationers on Sunday morning.  I did not see one single McDonald's.  I did not see a Starbuck's and I did not see one Wal-Mart.  I did see one Domino's Pizza.  I watched a woman butcher a chicken.  I watched an old lady pull pork by hand.  I paid $40 for a pair of swimming trunks that were worth $6.  I tried to go snorkeling but dropped my snorkel in the Pacific before I even got off the boat.  The tour guide tried to get me to pay $20 for it, but I refused and ended up paying $10.  I ate in a multi-stalled restaurant where the cooks attempted to sell their food to me by screaming at me and grabbing my arm.  I ate a delicious guisado de puerco prepared by a woman named Maria.  It cost $2.50, with a bottle of Coke, and blew away anything you could get at El Cid or Lazo's.  My friend paid two pesos for four squares of toilet paper and the privilege of taking a dump in the filthiest bathroom I've ever seen.  I tipped waiters to rack the balls for me at a bar on the seaside.  I tried to explain to them that I would rack my own balls, but they wouldn't let me.  A seventeen year old girl, the taxi driver and I sang songs on the way home.  I saw people living in conditions so horrible, they made any of the black ghettos on the South and West Sides of Chicago look like paradise.  I saw people riding in carts drawn by burros.  I rode the city bus and now have a new appreciation for the CTA because there was no suspension, no AC and it was a manual transmission.  I discussed the war in Iraq and George W. Bush with Anissa, Jorge, Alejandro and Pancho over too many shots of tequilla and several bottles of delicious Sol beer after they performed a play that was so homophobic, they'd never be able to do it here.  It was about a vampire who ate everyone but two gay guys, but the two guys scared him off after they tried to have sex with him repeatedly.  (I laughed my ass off!)  Like virtually everyone else outside of our country, they despise W and think that the war in Iraq is business as usual for America, about oil and disturbingly stupid.  I learned a lot from Pancho especially.  He was in awe at the amount of money I make, which is a paltry salary here, but would go a long way in Mexico.  If I say it in pesos, I do feel rich.  330,000 pesos!!!  HOLY SHIT!!!  He told me of the discrimination that he faces because he is dark skinned and some hilarious adventure stories.  We flew into Mexico City on the way home, a city of 25 million people, and it was an urban landscape as far as I could see in every direction from the airplane window.  I've been to a few other countries; the English are pretentious assholes, the Germans are subservient nerds, the Czechs are bitter and hard, the Dutch are just plain freaks and the Canadians are Americans.  I found everyone that I came across in Mexico to be extremely cool.  I would go back in a heartbeat.  Shit, I'd move there.

       You know, it became apparent to me after reading the article regarding Ms. Cunter's firing by USA Today that&nbsp;this woman is a cocaine addict.&nbsp; I realized after reading her paranoid, inane and completely whacked-out rambling of a report from the DNC,&nbsp;that her appearance on Scarborough Country a few weeks ago&nbsp;could finally be explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had&nbsp;one of the best cases of summer teeth I've ever seen, she looked like she was just released from Auschwitz and her thought processes&nbsp;were totally that of a person who had the cocaine-induced psychosis.&nbsp; She has peddled over a million units of her&nbsp;Hitler-esque crap to all of&nbsp;those fools out&nbsp;there, so she certainly has the means to support some serious blow snortin'.&nbsp; That's why she makes all that shit up and why it is so out there, so hateful and so gottdam stupid.&nbsp;   It all makes sense now.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Well, barring a crash during tomorrow's final stage, or perhaps worse yet, another soulless, banal top 40 hit from his girlfriend, it appears that Lance Armstrong will win the Tour De France.&nbsp; That's SIX in a row.&nbsp; Pretty impressive!&nbsp; In the interviews I saw, the media is already hounding him about going for a seventh.&nbsp; Lance wisely left that one up in the air.&nbsp; It's nice to see&nbsp;an American doing something positive in the world right now&nbsp;and something that we can be proud of.&nbsp; In France, no less.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I just read that Linda Ronstadt was fired from the Aladdin Hotel and Casino for endorsing Michael Moore's new film Fahrenheit 9/11 during a performance.&nbsp; Apparently, 4500 people "stormed out of the theater".&nbsp; Members of the audience "tore down concert posters" and "tossed cocktails in the air".&nbsp; This does not come from Joe Scarborough or Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh, this was reported by the Associated Press.&nbsp; This begs one question:&nbsp; who are these people?&nbsp;and how, in America, does Linda Ronstadt, of the film version of The Pirates of Penzance fame, get fired for expressing her opinion in 2004, in America?&nbsp; The answer is simple:&nbsp; considering the idiocy and disturbing sheep-like behavior of the American public during early 2003, these people are stupid, and they are everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the times in which we live.&nbsp;          &nbsp;    THE REICH IS BACK AND ITS SIGN IS THE W!!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   I'm being dramatic, but damn this is fun!

      I've been following with quite a bit of interest what many consider to be the greatest sporting event on the planet this time around.&nbsp; After all of the doping allegations and requisite denials regarding Mr. Lance Armstrong, I wanted to see if the guy could give everyone the big  FUCK YOU  and win an unprecedented sixth tour in a row.&nbsp; So far it's looking good for the Subaru-hocking-man from Plano, TX.&nbsp; I got to watch it on Saturday, and in his first stage win, he had this look on his face that&nbsp;pretty much said it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fellow cyclist, though not anywhere near at that level, I'm pulling for you Lance!&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; Rah!&nbsp; Rah!&nbsp; Win&nbsp;one for... uh, just win.&nbsp;

      So I was checking out what I had posted and I looked at the top of the blog, and I was legitimately horrified.&nbsp; Ads for the conservative book club were on top of my blog.&nbsp; MY BLOG!&nbsp; If that wasn't enough, there was an ad for Ann Coulter.&nbsp; I don't use this word much, but it certainly applies here.&nbsp; Ann Coulter is a cunt.&nbsp; She really is.&nbsp; She looks down her nose at the folks that have made her rich (again).&nbsp; There is no way on God's green Earth that she believes what she writes.&nbsp; I just refuse to believe that she does.&nbsp; She sounds like an ignorant redneck about to go on her thirtieth Klan ride.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; I sincerely believe that anyone who reads and/or listens to that person, and agrees with it,&nbsp;is stupid.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; Just like those who drive Hummers or supported the Iraq war.&nbsp; You are stupid.&nbsp; There's no room for argument here.&nbsp; You can say that you disagree with someone but you can still like them.&nbsp; I think that's true.&nbsp; But there are certain areas where people are just stupid.&nbsp; They really are.&nbsp; I'm rambling.&nbsp;

      Summer has finally arrived here in Chicago.  I don't have much to write.  I've been too busy to pay attention to much of the current events for a few days.  I'm getting kinda worn out of all the bullshit, so a break is needed anyway.  I haven't been swimming yet this summer and am hoping to do some of that this weekend.  We shall see.

      John Kerry has chosen John Edwards to be his running mate.  The two Johns.  Let's hope they were never johns.  Edwards was a personal injury lawyer.  Ooohh, slimy, Ick.  The GOP has labeled him "a disingenuous, unaccomplished liberal and friend to personal-injury trial lawyers".  No matter how much it pains me to do so, I gotta agree with the Republicans on this one.  Oh, well -  A.B.B!!!

       Today while eating my pulled-pork sandwich with a bowl of delicious cream of broccoli soup, a pair of our city's finest walked into the restaurant and sat with one of their superiors, already stuffing his considerable belly. These were plainclothes officers. What got my attention was one officer in particular. He was, now I'm being generous here, about 5'2" tall. He was the eensiest, teensiest, little policeperson that your humble narrator has ever seen. But my how he did strut about, like a friggin' gorilla pounding on his chest. He was an itsy bitsy man with a gun and the gun was damn near as long as the little Napolean's arm. But the best part of all, the show stealer, the cherry on top, was that he was wearing a tee-shirt that said:  PRO WAR . I shit you not. A member of the Chicago Police Department was walking around, swinging his arms, with some idiotic tough-guy look on his face, during his shift, in public with a purple tee shirt emblazoned with six large white letters:  PRO WAR . I still don't know if I should call and complain. What a fucking fool.
