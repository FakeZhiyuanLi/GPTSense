      I had one doggie sister and I have two human sisters. Despite my musing that I love Mom so much, I love my human sisters very much too. I'm sad they are far away. My sisters buy me gifts and love my licks. My oldest sister Rachel really mad me sad by getting a dog. I guess he's my nephew but he's also a tool. My other sister Sarah is very cool even though she likes cats. I hate cats. My family had one once and she just tried to harass me. I even like the FFF (flat-faced fiend) more than that. I hope I see my sisters soon, sans cats and pug!

      My favorite human is Mom.  She keeps me company every day, and she tries to make my nasty new food taste better.  I have become very fussy about what I eat.  She takes me for nice slow walks, makes sure I get all my medicine, and she gives me lots of love, even when I'm driving her crazy.  In return, I make sure she is never alone, and I'm always glad to see her.

      Listen, you flat faced retard. You can post on my blog, but don't post under my name. This is MY Blog, but you can comment. Read the directions, or get what's her name to read them to you, since your eyes are too far apart to read anything except for a billboard!

      Today is July 27, 2004. My food strike is now almost three weeks old. The stupid vet scared Hope into changing my dog food because one of my kidney tests wasn't normal. Normal? I'm 15 friggin years old...nothing's normal about that. So, Hope gave my old kibble to her sister's fat assed Dashounds and bought me this new lo-protein stuff. I hate it and I won't eat it. I am driving Hope nuts. She has bought me special gravy, special treats, all kinds of things to make me eat the scummy new food. Me? I just eat the stuff she puts on it that I like and ignore the kibble. Ha, ha, ha...Hope is going NUTS! The strike will continue until the old kibble is back! Beagles of the World Unite!!!

      Hi Cleo,  It's me, Blue. I just finished wrecking some of mommy's things and thought I'd give you a shout out. I know you pretty much despise me but I was just hoping maybe we could mend fences before I come and visit for a week (hope that's not a shock for ya). I'm really not that bad, I just do love to sniff your dean (as your mommy would say). I'll try to cut back. Maybe I could help you out, I could eat your gross-ass food so your parents think you're eating it! What do you say? My mommy has more pictures of you up than me, she really loves you.  Love, Blue

      I went for a walk yesterday( Sunday, July 25, 2004) with Hope and Frank, by the sea wall in Narragansett. I hate when Frank has my leash. He never lets me stop to smell what I want. All he wants to do is walk. What a pain in the...! Hope lets me smell whatever I want. She lets me wander in circles if I want to. She also picks up my poop. She carries these plastic bags just for that purpose. We walked for about 30 minutes, then I started to pant. So, they led me back to the car and we went for a little ride. When we got home, I fell asleep.

      In two weeks I am going to my summer cottage for a little r and r. Everyone will be there: mom, dad, the sisters, the dumb brother-in-law and that jackass pug. Except for Blue, who I could honestly toss in the ocean, I'm excited. I'm already making plans:  1) Work on my tan: since I am completely covered in fur, the only part I can really tan is my abdomin, but that's okay. I plan to get a nice dark underbelly by week's end.  2) Finally finish reading The Corrections: I started this two years ago when mom was reading it. I used to read over her elbow when she was reading. She reads much faster than me, so even though she finished, I didn't. I will sneak her copy and head outside to find out how the book ends.  3)Play some High Stakes Poker: I can't wait! Last year I won tons of treats because I'm really good at bluffing. We'll see if I can keep it up this year.  4)See the new Shymalan flick: I heard it wasn't very good, but I'd like to see for myself.   5)Convince Blue that he should stop sniffing my butt: Seriously.  Well, these are all the plans I have so far. It's going to be great.

      My favorite material possession of all is my blue blanket. My older sister bought it for me for Christmas about four years ago. Sadly, my dumbass nephew pissed all over it the last time he came to visit. That is the problem: the youth of today have no respect, none, whatsoever, for others. Do I go around expelling bodily fluids on his stuff. No. Why? Because I have some basic self-respect that's why. Anyway, I sure do love my blue blanket.

      I love to sleep. I bet that I can now sleep 20 hours a day or more. I used to love to sleep on sofas or beds, but now I am happiest sleeping on the floor.
