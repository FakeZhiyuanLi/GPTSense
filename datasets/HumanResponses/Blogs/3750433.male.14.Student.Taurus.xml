      I recently went to the cinema to watch the new HP (Harry Potter) movie =P! I had my doubts because of the new director and all but it turned out better than it's forefathers =P! I didn't get a chance to read part 3 so everything was a surprise! The story was more complicated than the others because of the tima traveling at the ending. All the special effects were greatly made =)! Here's a short summary of the story:  Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkban.  At first we find Harry struggling with his aunt, uncle and nephew. The sister of his uncle is coming over for dinner. When the sister starts to make bad comments on Harry's mum and dad, he gets pissed. So pissed that he blows up the woman and sents her of into the skies above =P! When his uncle starts yelling again, Harry decides to leave his home and searches for a new place to stay. While walking down the street he sees a kindergarten. He decides to sit down and think for a little while. Across the street, a black dog arises from the bushes. Later on it happens to be a "grimp". Just at the nick of time, Harry is saved by the bus for stranded wizards and wobbles. It's a very amusing moment =D! In the bus, there is a small head with a Jamaican accent making funny comments on everything and stuff =P! It really made me laugh =)! Harry is dropped of at the Leaky Coldren, where the minister of magic awaits him. Although Harry needs to be exepelled from Hogwarts, he gets of with a warning. Everybody is just glad that nothing happened to Harry. All of this made him think... The next day, Harry meets the Weaslies and Mr. Weasly tells him why he isn't expelled. It appears that a vivious murderer called Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban. Sirius Black was a good friend of the Potters but betrayed them (atleast, that's what we're told at the beginning). Sirius has escaped to kill Harry! As usual, nobody may know or find out about it. On the Hogwarts Express something strange happens. All of the sudden, in the middle of nowhere, the train comes to a halt. Everybody is wondering what happened. All of the sudden, the whole train freezes and a hand opens the cabin that Harry, Ron, Hermiene and a mystery man are in. It's a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. The demetor tries to kill Harry but at the nick of time, the mystery man jumps up to save him. With a birght white light, the dementor is sent away. Harry faints. A lot of rubbish happens but nothing really useful =P! I will tell more later but for now, GOTTA GO! Bye! See ya!
