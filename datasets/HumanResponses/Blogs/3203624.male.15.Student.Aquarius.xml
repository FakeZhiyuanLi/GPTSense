       Okay. Maybe I over-reacted yesterday. The Cubbies DOMINATED the Bucs 12-1 today. BUT-- they are still in 3rd place. Not exactly the cat's ass, but it's better than 5th place.  I'm still looking forward to that Sox game though. I haven't been to a MLB game in like 5 years, so it should be fun. And I have tickets for those seats right behind home plate, so look for me on TV!! :P  Weather sucked today. Rain. Rain. And more rain. Global warming, perhaps?

       I [temporarily] HATE the f**king Cubs. Whenever something great happens to them, someone, or SOMETHING, blows it for them. Their  5 STRAIGHT LOSSES  show that they are nothing without their best players (Sosa, Prior, Wood, etc.). They fail to come together as a team when they lose or when a player gets injured. They just think, "Oh, poor us, we'll never win without Sosa/Wood/Prior." Give me a fuggin' break.  Sox rule. At least they're in god damn 1st. And I got free tix to go to the Sox game on June 22. Maybe I'll just forget about the Cubs and move on to an actual team. The Cubs better get their sh*t straight quickly. VERY quickly.  Oh, incase you didn't know: The Cubs lost both games of the double header yesterday against the Pirates and lost AGAIN against them tonight. The last game in the series is tomorrow (Sunday).

       There's not much going on today. I start working tomorrow, so I have to enjoy my last free day today. Have to be at the school @ 6:45 tonight to play for the graduation. They make us play behind the friggin' curtain. It's pointless. They might as well just play a god damn recording.  Cubs today @ 4:05pm on Fox Sports Net (cable/satellite only). :)

       Yes, you'll be hearing about the Chicago Cubs from me. Get used to it. :)  The Cubs lost AGAIN to the Houston Astros with a score of 7 to 3. The Cubs are now 3rd in the NL Central division with 25 wins, 20 loses, and they are not 1.5 games behind the 1st place team.  More later.

       Yes! Summer officially began at 11:02am this morning. Ahahahahahahaha to all you who are still in school. Finals were a bitch, but at least they're over. I went over to my friend Karl's house after school today along with another friend (Joe). Joe was like totally rocking out all day. 'Twas pretty entertaining. ;) And then, of course, there was some time spent making fun of me, but that is to be expected. :P  Most people think that summer break means staying up late and sleeping until noon the next day. AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I wish. Here's my daily summer schedule:  5:30am - Wake up, get ready for swim practice 6-8:30am - Swim practice 9-10:00am - Lifeguard inservice 12-6:30pm - WORK as lifeguard  Only positive thing is that i get $7 an hour. Not too bad. :)  k catch ya on the flip-side. More ramblings later maybe.

       My skin is literally burning off thanks to the stupid pool at the park district where the chlorine level was in a DANGER ZONE. Not cool. I've taken 3 showers now and I still smell like liquid nitrogen.  Anyways, Cubs lost. Hopefully sox can pull it off.  Catch ya on the flip-side.

       Yes, that's right. I'm making teh maj0r l33t buckz. I got $20 just for going to some pointless meeting today. I'll get another $20 tonight for finishing up lifeguard training. So far this summer, I've made about $60 just for going to 3 meetings. It r0x0rz my b0x0rz.  More rain tonight (whoa, big surprise). Cubs are finally tied for 2nd place. 'bout time they got their sh*t straight. They're 27-23 now. I think they play Houston again tonight @ 7:05pm. Watch plz.
