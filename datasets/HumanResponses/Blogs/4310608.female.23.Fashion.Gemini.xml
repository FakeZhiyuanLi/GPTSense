         Of course  I wouldn't be writing about that. I look at all these blogs and they are so perfectly done. I guess I have no knowledge about how to make my blog look cool, so this may take a while.            I am trying to do this with my 2 year old trying to climb on my lap. It isn't easy. And then theres my 8  month old, who just finished gumming corn on the cob, and is devourly happy. Too cute.           "What, my child, do you want from me?" Other than my uninturrupted attention? Neither of them allow me to have one minute alone on this computer. Its not even my own, so I only get on it once a week, if that. The computer, is at my mothers, and she likes to be on the computer as much as me.            With her sad toy collection, my children are hardly entertained, but its funny, even with the toys they have at home, they still seem hardly amused. What is it with children? It seems that you spend hundreds, even thousands of dollars on toys, and watch them collect dust, or sit in the bottom of the toy bin, hardly disturbed over the past month . I just don't get it !         Don't get me wrong, of course, because my children are the most beautiful things in the whole wide world. But its one of those things...like , 'when is it MY time? '             I gave birth to them and they came from my own flesh and blood, and that of my husbands as well. They both look so much like me, because I am a red-head, and my kids are red-heads. The traits they get from their father are their lengthy height and crooked teeth!  When I get photos on here, you'll see. I'll get photos of them with me and you can see how much they look like me.

       I just read about blogs in Teen Vogue. It seemed interesting to me, since I am a journal keeper anyways. The only downfall is that I don't have a computer at home, and my access to this is at my moms. I come about once a week or so, but not more than that. So, I'd like to entry my blog every day, but I don't see it happening. I'll do what I can to keep it to a couple times a week, but I'm not making myself any promises. I don't know if this is even a good idea. A open journal on the web for the world to see. Who I am. On any given day. The real me. I'll be writing about my marriage, my children, my sisters, in-laws, pets, weight, my work, my religion, my desire to be the things I want to be. Hang onto your seats, because I am one, very dramatic, emotional, roller coaster ride, and you will see me go in circles, and ups and downs.
