      See also my entry on Saudi efforts to  urlLink distract  Americans with a public relations campaign.  From a  urlLink MEMRI translation of Saudi Armed Forces "Know your Enemy" article.    Saudi Armed Forces Journal on the Jews: 'The Fabricated Torah, Talmud, and Protocols of the Elders of Zion Command Destruction of All Non-Jews for World Domination'   And this is different from what Adolf Hitler and Osama Bin Laden have said because?  Don your tinfoil turbans and enter into the nuanced world of blatant anti-Semitism.

      As those of you who have sated your primal desires to read my profile know, today is my last day on Earth as a 33-year old human being.  Tomorrow is my birthday.   Now, as happens every year, I don't know what I "want" for my birthday any more than I do for Christmas. Gifts are cool, gimme gimme, but don't ask me what I want. I don't know.   I think my fiance is getting me a cell phone, like hers. Her cellphone has e-mail, video games, TV channels, limited range mind control laser targeting, the works.   Hell, I don't even wear a watch, which is the 3rd most evil thing mankind has ever invented, behind #2 - Nuclear Weapons, and #1 - Pepsi-Cola.   I guess it's time for me have a cell phone too.

      I noticed new cameras in the parking lot of my designated living space.   Cameras are everywhere. I've read somewhere that the average British citizen is photographed some 10,000 times a day by various things - security cameras, traffic monitors, ATMs, the like.   I think it's spreading to America. You see cameras on buses. Some people are even sick enough to have cameras hooked to their computer.   Me, I hate cameras. Not as much as I hate clowns (I REALLY HATE CLOWNS - I'll save that for later) but cameras really make me feel like I'm in prison. Watch out for the long-hair, he might whip out a comb and make sure he's presentable. Not. It's Big Brotherish.    "Mr. Beamish, We  know  that you ordered 5 White Castle Cheeseburgers and they gave you 20...."    I guess I long for a time when the only people taking pictures of me were relatives, wedding parties, the driver's license bureau, cops, and Japanese tourists.

      As I was driving this morning jamming out to some good music, I heard a strange message on the radio.  The  urlLink Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,  fresh from their  urlLink proclaimed victory  against  urlLink "Zionists,"  have begun targeting nineteen American metropolitan areas with an  urlLink advertising campaign  to promote their warm and fuzziness. The attacks will continue through September 6th. Radio listeners in the following zone improvement plans are advised to turn off their radios and televisions and play  urlLink forbidden music  from tapes, CDs, and mp3s until the crisis is averted:   Atlanta, Georgia Baltimore, Maryland Birmingham, Alabama Boston, Massachussetts Chicago, Illinois Cleveland, Ohio Dallas, Texas Detroit, Michigan Houston, Texas Kansas City, Missouri Memphis, Tennessee Minneapolis, Minnesota Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Phoenix, Arizona Portland, Maine St. Louis Missouri Seattle, Washington Tampa, Florida Washington, DC   There is no word yet on how many barrels of oil this media blitz will cost.

      Mrs. Beamish-to-be and I have finally convinced her mother, who suffers from  urlLink Bush Derangement Syndrome , to not vote for Kerry. But, she's going to vote for Ralph Nader.  urlLink [She better bring a pen.]  At least he's honest about his hatred for anything that makes sense, in a  urlLink Dennis-Kucinich -is-a-sellout sort of way. The military NEEDS those  urlLink orbital mind control lasers , you  urlLink  goofball  .     And after Molly Ivins has  urlLink fled to Canada , the media are finally  urlLink answering the draft  and turning their microscopes on Kerry. A little.  Now let's see if they'll  urlLink take the lens cap off.

      Absolutely.  You wanna know why I started this blog?  Because they killed Winston Smith, that's why, beeyotch!  So, if you're depressed about this slump America's in, where the whole world is  supposed to be playa hatin on us coz we up and done it to Iraq, everybody's rights are being trampled, nobody is gettin paid, we need health care reform, and the dogs are on our ass...  ...at least according to the Kerry campaign, the liberal media, Hollywood, and the state-controlled media of regimes that are hostile to the United States around the world, lighten up.  You can come to St. Louis and get your  urlLink bling-bling  on. This is front page news. Excuse me, I'm sorry. This is front page, above the fold, left column news.  How long until John Kerry "pimps the grill" on his rhetorical  urlLink blackface act ?  This is irony, clogging the memory hole.   "KERRY / EDWARDS 2004 -- BECAUSE A TICKET THIS FULL OF SHIT NEEDS TWO JOHNS"

      I'm a people watcher. Reality happens when you turn off the TV.  So anyway, I'm standing in line at the grocery store behind this old man, and he's angry. No, scratch that. He's pissed.  Seems that the old man just wants to pay for his items and go home (like me, behind him) but the cashier is trying to get the old man's name, address, and phone number even though he's paying with cash.  CASHIER: "I  need  your information for the computer, sir..."  OLD MAN: "Why? Are you going to come over to my house and f*ck me?"   Of course, this turns the whole rote-training customer service manual on its head, so Cashier Girl is panicking and calling for back-up when another cashier leans in and says "Just take his money and let him go," as she rolls her eyes and blends back into the background. The old man continues to rant about "how computers have made the world stupid." Cashier Girl is almost in tears. I almost felt a twinge of empathy for her.  Talk about a scene that should be in a movie.

       urlLink "Terrorists" with NBC gear  were arrested attempting to acquire a helicopter.    Arlene Thomas grew suspicious when two men with out-of-state drivers licenses and a large wad of cash came into her Sauget helicopter hangar Wednesday morning and said they wanted to see St. Louis landmarks from the sky.   The men, whom Thomas described to police as of "Middle Eastern descent," were carrying a duffel bag and a backpack and drove up in a rental car with Texas license plates.     Who knows where this story will go. My money's on screaming rants about racial profiling and discriminating against Muslimistic-looking people by CAIR.  [update] 11:25AM  What would the NBC News story have been if their stunt was successful? "Look world, how easy it is to take helicopters for joy-rides in America."  I'm with the airport director guy in the article. How dare NBC News create a false alarm and scare up first responders unnecessarily in MY city? ::Dark Knight Batman voice::

      I went on a quest for  urlLink John Kerry's positions on issues  and found:   SENATOR JOHN FORBES KERRY REFUSED TO PROVIDE ANY RESPONSES TO CITIZENS ON ISSUES THROUGH THE NATIONAL POLITICAL AWARENESS TEST   SENATOR JOHN FORBES KERRY REFUSED TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WHEN ASKED TO DO SO ON 23 SEPARATE OCCASIONS BY:  MSNBC CBS News Cox Newspapers Knight Ridder National Journal MTV New Hampshire Public Broadcasting Tucson Citizen St. Paul Pioneer Press Portsmouth Herald Nashua Telegraph Iowa Public Radio Ames Daily Tribune Cedar Rapids Gazette Iowa City Press The State (SC) WYY Philadelphia San Jose Mercury News Geraldine Ferraro, Former Democratic Congresswoman Michael Dukakis, Fomer Democratic Congressman Bill Frenzel, Former Republican Congressman Jim Leach, Republican Congressman Richard Kimball, Project Vote Smart President     [Kerry forgot to articulate any ideas or state any policy positions at the Democratic National Convention as well.]  Seems the fine journalists over at theonion.com have finally figured out  urlLink where Kerry stands .   It seems you and I both are qualified to be President. We're not Bush either.

      ...at the  urlLink John Kerry for President 2004  campaign. Here's a guy that wants you to look at  urlLink "his record"  (but won't talk of his  urlLink war protesting,  his dismal Senate career, or release his military records), wants you to talk to the  urlLink "men he served with"  (but is threatening lawsuits to silence the men he served with, the Swift Vets for Truth), keeps talking about "internationalizing" the Iraq reconstruction effort (while primarily non-American contract workers are being kidnapped and beheaded to terrorize non-American countries into withdrawing  their  troops and workers from Iraq), and wants to settle the Iranian quest for nuclear weapons (by  urlLink GIVING the Iranians enriched uranium .)  My question for Mr. Kerry, should I infiltrate a town hall debate -  "Senator Kerry, do you even remotely have a f*ckin' clue what you're talking about? No, no. Look at me, not your staff, bitch. Do you even have any idea how abso-f*ckin goofy you are?"  Alas, politics remains unrefined.

      Is there anybody out there?  Good. Now that we're completely alone, let me tell you a thing or two about what's really going on.  The government has mind control lasers in orbit right now forcing innocent people all around the world to listen to  urlLink self-confessed war criminal John Kerry  talk about how much the world hates America.  Otherwise, people might question his patriotism.
