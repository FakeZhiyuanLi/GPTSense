      To the Napster 2.0 launch at Sketch in Conduit Street, all very happy clappy Ben'n'Jerry's patronising smug American shit, they're all "real excited". In fact, all that remains of old Napster is the logo and the name which Roxio picked up for a song after the major labels forced Napster's closure. The first problem as I see it is that they've already hobbled themselves by not suppoting the iPOD. The iPOd is, like the the Hoover, the Biro and the Portakabin, destined to be the generic name for all mp3 jukebox players regardless of their connection to Apple, pretty much in the same way that any cheapie portable cassette player is a 'Walkman'. It has been the iPOD which has kick started the new paradigm, therefore Napster is already dealing with the second best runners up. Also, looked at harshly, it's poor value for money. Downloads are 99p (or £1.09 for non-subscribers) per track compared with 99c in the US. And downloading an album for £9.95 -- pretty much the standard price -- is actually a raw deal: what you get are WMA files which are not 'lossless' and therefore not as good as a store-bought CD. I had a look at a bunch of albums I was thinking of buying -- various Mahavishnu Orchestra back catalogue, some Bach cantatas, Beefheart etc. The actual selection on Napster is a bit limited, but not terrible. Probasbly fine if you want the new Usher record but not great if you veer away from the mainstream. But the fact is that I went into HMV this morning and all of them were on sale for between £4.99 and £6.99. I don't know if they're banking on people's laziness but I think that when the novelty has worn off it isn't going to woo anyone away from high street retailers or existing 'outlaw' p2p networks like Soulseek or KaZaa. Still, being first always counts for something I suppose. What was great about the old Napster was the possibility of finding loads of amazing stuff, like Acid Mothers Temple or Comets On Fire or stuff that I used to have but just can't track down anymore like Naked City's Torture Garden. Needless to say there's none of that on new Napster: it's all safely coralled and neutered by the major labels.

      It seems trite, with everything going on in the world and everything else going on in my life, to say that I’m thrilled to bits with my iPOD. I came into a bit of money unexpectedly last month when the Metal Hammer team won £1000 [split 5 ways] at the Scuzz rock quiz.  Frankly my contributions were pitiful and if it was done fairly, Terry Beezer would have walked off with the lot, including the bottle of Jack Daniels that I also won. Always a great prize for a teetotaller. Anyway, I haven’t bought anything for me for ages and I was in town, went past Micro Anvika and looked with envy upon the POD. I had planned to wait until I went to the US because with the exchange rate the way it is I could have saved shitloads of money. But…well let’s just say that I was in the grip of the fetishism of commodities. At first I was going to get the Creative Jukebox Zen 30 GB, but I thought ‘Fuck it, get an iPOD’. I know that there are some issues with the batteries, but it just looks so fucking beautiful. I was going to get the 15 GB, then the 20 GB but again I thought ‘Fuck it’ and bought the 40 GB model. It’s slightly fatter than the others but it still fits into the top pocket of the jacket.   I haven’t even come close to filling it up yet: there’s about 15 BG of music on it and when I get any spare time I’m ripping CDs.  I had a Walkman when they first launched in the late 70s – or rather, I had a cheap knock-off – and it seemed such an innovation at the time.  Until you have an iPOD it’s hard to appreciate what a huge leap it is from a Walkman or a CD player or even a Mini Disc player. I’ve always resisted buying an Mp3 player up until now because they seemed to be poor value for money: £100 or thereabouts for a 256 MB or even a 512 MB player seemed a bit steep for such a limited player.  Going out with a CD walkman was too much trouble; ditto the mini disc player because you had to carry the media with you too and fumble around changing discs when you got bored. With the iPOD it’s all so bloody easy. Emperor or Captain Beefheart or Bach or Miles Davis or The Beach Boys or Neurosis or Messiaen; it’s there wherever and whenever I want it.  It’s changed the way that I listen to music and also the music I listen to: there are albums that I haven’t listened to in years that I’m hearing almost anew. I think that the iPOD [and I now use the brand name as a confused generic term for all hard disc jukebox players] will save the music industry [not that I necessarily think that that’s a good thing!] because it will allow them to make money from downloads. I suspect that they’ll be reselling their back catalogue yet again [something that saved their asses in the 80s and 90s] but at any rate people will be buying downloads and more Cds too, to rip to fill the damn things up. They’re gonna get bigger and cheaper too: Creative have just brought out an 80 GB model for less than the 40 GB iPOD.   It’s nice to be on the right side of a paradigm shift.   ----------   My Going To Work Playlist   RAMBLIN’ ROSE – The MC5  CUSTARD PIE – Led Zeppelin  DO THE STRAND – Roxy Music  SWORD AND BROKEN – The Screaming Trees  SHAMAN’S BLUES – The Doors  CLICK CLACK – Captain Befheart  SOMEBODY GOT MURDERED – The Clash  GREEN FUZZ – The Cramps  NEW ROSE – The Damned  SEVEN DAYS IS TOO LONG – Dexy’s Midnight Runners  OUT ON THE SIDE – Dillard & Clarke  BLACK NAPKINS – Frank Zappa  URBAN GUERILLA – Hawkwind  THUNDERBOX – Humble Pie  I WANNA BE YOUR DOG – the Stooges  TEEN RIOT STRUCTURE – T-Rex  MARQUEE MOON – Television

      Sickening. The men in the video said the killing was revenge for abuse and humiliation of 'muslims' by US guards at Abu Ghraib prison. It would have happened anyway: maybe not to this man, but it would have happened. These are the same people who threatened to burn Japanese hostages alive. This is the same mentality as the women killers on the hijacked AA flights that crashed into the twin towers, the same sort of butchers who slaughtered the tourists in Egypt, who bombed the trains in Madrid. The difference is that we are appalled and disgusted when our soldiers engage in attrocious acts; these guys are treated like heroes. At best, Islamist opinion remains muted: No we don't condone this, but you have to understand... The same shit you read from the bourgeois liberal columnists here. Where are the 'Not In My Name' marches across the Arab world?   I'm not a 'neo con'; I just don't believe, as arseholes like George Galloway, the SWP, Guardian windbags etc seem to that these Islamist fanatics are somehow on 'our' side. Our enemy's enemy or something like that. As a sort of minimal Marxist, my enemy's enemy in this case is the United States of America.  That said, the war in Iraq has been a botch from the beginning. Instead of this 'weapons of mass destruction' bullshit which nobody actually believed, it would have been better to come clean about the real reasons for invading. This is a war to shift the balance of economic and political power in the Middle East away from the posionous influence of the Saudi Arabians. By installing a pro Western or at least neutral secular 'democratic' state in Iraq, it would allow Europe and the US to disengage from their reliance on Saudi oil. The Saudis, who are the real paymasters of the Jihadists, are the real enemy. By cutting off trade, the US will effectively starve the worldwide Mujahadeen of funds. That's the thinking. There was a very small window of opportunity in which to do this and I'm very afraid that it has already closed.   ----------   CURRENTLY LISTENING TO   THE SERPENTS GOLD by Cathedral [Earache advance CD]

      The summer edges miserably towards London; we have skies the colour of a bruise and that uncomfortable clammy heat that will be with us until late September. The images from the newspapers of tortured Iraqis seems to fit the climate.  I wasn't opposed to the war; not in Iraq, not in Afghanistan. I'm not an enthusiast for war, but both interventions had to happen. But these pictures just undo so much of the good that was done: it's almost as if I'm less shocked by the notion that British or American troops would torture or abuse prisoners. It's the fact that they took fucking snapshots. What for? To show the kids? I'm tempted to think that some residual element of their humanity took them as a kind of confession. The guards at Dachau used to collect souvenirs and mementos, the Khmer Rouge meticulously recorded and photographed the millions they killed. Maybe they just wanted something to illustrate the history books, a ghastly sort of immortality.  I'm realistic. If, during World War II we had the same amount of scrutiny and media coverage as we have had in every conflict of recent times, our perception would be different. Allied troops raped, allied troops stole, allied troops tortured, allied troops shot prisoners who were surrendering, allied troops terrorised civilian populations.  But back then soldiers were shot. I think redeploying, sacking, suspending these soldiers and their superiors isn't enough. Shooting? Maybe that's too good for them.   ----------   Have just heard some of the new Dillinger Escape Plan album Miss Machine. This is music that sounds like war; absolutely terrifying stuff. It has the potential to be huge; given that 'difficult' bands like Tool and Radiohead can sell enough albums to put them on a level playing field with yer Linkin Parks is proof that people's tastes for music of a more 'extreme' nature has been whetted. Spoke to Ben on Friday night for a piece in the next Metal Hammer and he was philopsophical, seeing Dillinger as potentially Mudhoney or the melvins to some other band's Nirvanma: "Sometimes we’re just waiting for a DEP rip off band to become gigantic, citing us as an influence on Behind The Music while we’re living with our parents!”   ----------   Currently reading   SHOSTAKOVICH AND STALIN by Solomon Volkov [Little Brown £10.99]   Also recommended   VIOLENT LONDON by Clive Bloom [Pan £6.99]  UNDERGROUND LONDON by Stephen Smith [Little Brown £17.99]   DOWN & OUT IN SHOREDITCH AND HOXTON by Stewart Home [The Do Not Press £7.99]   Currently listening to   WHITE 2 by Sunn O))) [Southern Lord 2004]  A TRIBUTE TO JACK JOHNSON by Miles Davis [Columbia 1970]  OFFICIUM by Jan Garbarek & The Hilliard Ensemble [ECM 1996]  EPITAPH by Sverrir Gudjónsson [Opus III 1999]   Currently watching   The Kingdom [DVD]  Kingdom Hospital [BBC 2, Sundays, 10pm]  London [BBC2, Fridays, 9pm]
