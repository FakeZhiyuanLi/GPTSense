But after lunch, i slept till 4pm and after that went to take a shower, so refresh after that.        After taking a shower, went over to help out with my granny, she been complaining pain everywhere in her body, and it was really bad to see this happening to her.  She cried two time today and said that she is very useless and she wanted to die better than letting everyone suffering now.  After listening to it, the feeling was like.  Help her to exercise by moving her arm and leg, and ask her to do some neck thingy that i learn from the doctor last time.      okay, shall end here and do homework.  Hope tomorrow will be able to go out to eat tim sum.. See ya!

        today was school national day, and also the tanglin idol final.  Our team came in third with the malay girl, overall quite sad as we practise so hard and didn't manage to get first. However, all of us was quite disappointed but no choice, in our heart we did our best is enough already.       the celebration was quite fun, first time ever sing in front of the whole school, that is the first time i'm so daring to be in front of the school.  Didn't join them for the line dancing as there is some class chairman thing.  after that didn't went out with my class, went out to orchard with the NP friend.      went to watch 'The Village', the movie was quite nice although it had a boring opening.  I got frighten by the red creature.  The movie is about a village of people, that change the enviroment of their living, they went to a hill next to the wood. From there, the elder of the village make up story that there is something in the woods, and the villager is suppose not to enter the woods.... overall the show is quite nice and meaningful? haha.. alright, i'm not writing a reveiw about it. Haha.. after that went to pacific plaza and it happened that there is a quarrel between our friend Wei Qiang with the shop keeper. haha.. overall.. i don't reallly know what happen.        My granny came back home today, and she look quite okay, but really very weak.  And i was like so useless and cannot help out much.  So i should find time to be with her.  It been a long time that both grandson and grandma didn't talk.  It will be the right time now.        Shall end here! See ya!

        tomorrow will be the final for the tanglin idol and i think we really put in a lot of effort from forming the group to the step to the final production time, it really worthwhile.  So tomorrow, we will be able to do well! ALL THE BEST EVERYONE! haha.. some words of encouragement.. or else.. haha..       today school was quite boring because the lesson we had today is not really very interesting and worthwhile.  Only the history and math i think so far i found it useful for thursday.  Wanted to go home during english period and decided not to, haha.. overall it quite boring from there onwards.      after school, we got the tanglin idol thingy at the parade square and then in the classroom, there is also SC thingy in the hall, overall both also quite important. So is quite a busy day tomorrow, national day..  haha..       Just when i was updating the blog,  she message me and wish me good luck! haha.. ;)      went home around 9pm like that, really tired out and don't feel like going to school tomorrow. but i cannot.. damn sian.. haha.. okay.. shall not complain if not i will feel more sian about it.. haha..       tomorrow had to reach school around 6.15am.. it was like so early, nevermind.. haha.. shall not complain.. haha.. nitez everyone!

        i guess i must be quite mad about this blog, maybe is the one minute fever i always have the new stuff that i come by.  this is the third entry of the day, actually thought that i was unable to update tonight, however, i think i got the day mix up, thought today is friday.       our team went in to the final of the tanglin idol and tomorrow still need to practise, quite happy and sad that we enter the final. happy is that the effort we put in, is now coming back as a reward, but the sad thing is that i had to give up my resting and sleeping time.  haha..    hope that we can win something at the end of the day.      still thinking of new handphone, Nokia 7610, althought the phone don't have radio and it like office type, i think i had fall in love with the phone, the day and night i thinking of it.  After 'N'? i think i cannot wait! haha.. hope to get it ASAP!      haha.. shall end here.. hope tomorrow is a new day! Good Luck Everyone!!

      today was the second day of my prelim, it was social studies paper.  Lucky what i study the last night  really  put into work.  I focus on chapter 2 & 4 and the question came out for chapter 4.  I was so happy when i see the question was about switzerland.  Managed to finish doing section b within the time i planned.  However, for section a didn't managed to finish my last question, and it was the most important point.  Nevermind, try harder for my 'n' level which will be coming shortly.  after the paper went to queenway shopping centre to got someone to print the NCO tee for us.  The shirt cost me $22 and it was quite.. haha.. overall it worth it.  At least when i get old, i still know that i have a squad that is so fun.. haha.. after that went to ikea to see what to get for my new room.. Although had to share room with my granny, i don't mind cause i had a private bathroom.  Feel quite bad for giving the comment i gave just now, keep it back and put it back into my mouth.  Finally i found out what i can give to the sec 2 and they will be able to use it.  Hope they like it.  This blog rock, better than the old one.  Should had changed it long time ago.  haha.. okay.. shall end here.. see ya!

      Today, was quite a interesting day for me.  I skipped school for the first half day and went back during recess.  Morning went to send my sister and her husband to Japan, they are so relax even though they are going on the business trip.  Just hope that next time, it will happen to me also.  Went back to school during, didn't went to take the pink form. Feel very bad but no choice, i scared of detention, it very boring thing.  After school, helping out at the sec 3 with the POP, it just brought me back to last year when i was the PC than.  Got a lot of help from the sir and mdm.  This time round, it time to pass down to them.  Hope they will be able to make it! So people will have a different eyes on them.  Overall, they are quite funny, keep laughing all the way one.  Cannot be serious, must scold all the time.  Esp the Sophiana, the MC, damn funny.. she is always giving us joke to laugh about, the eye when she turn over, so all the best! The sec 2 was really giving my heartache when i saw them got some problem over the I/C stuff, not everyone in life will given the chance, so don't need to worry, i make sure you all will be able to take charge from time to time.  So don't let us see you all separated when we going to pop, it a very sad thing to see for us! haha.. than happen to us when Mdm huiying and Mingwei left us, lucky they don't know about it when they left.  So, come on sec 2, be more united together ok? haha.. The sec1 was still really very cheerful and fun, be more serious for sec 1! haha.. okay.. shall stop the stuff liao, if not i will become a grandfather nagging.  After that, went back home to rest, really very sick now, the flu is not getting any better, and the cough was getting better.  Sleeping with the flu was really very hard, like cannot breathe, haha.. so okay.. my grandma went to hositpal again today, she keep complaining that her back it very pain, so the thing we can do now is to send her to hositpal, my mum went also, than father no at home, no one company to see doctor.  Pan is the med than i need now.. damn sick.. see ya!

The Sotong and Crabmeat with bacon was really very nice.  The Grass Jelly become the Glass Jelly, haha..        After that, went to the MRT station to top up ez-link for my uncle but the quenue was still very long, no choice but to quenue up, but come to the my q was like the faster, less than 5min i reach the machine while the q next to me was like still waiting at the middle.  After that took bus 51 back home, on the bus look at the picture that we just take at the place.. reach home around 11.35pm like that, everyone was asleep when i reached home, and no one scolded me.  hehe..      Yesterday afternoon, asked her one more time whether she still want to the firework a not, but the answer was negative, she decided to go to her friend place for BBQ.  So what can i do,  actually wanted to go see the bag that she mentioned that one of her male friend going to buy for her.  but the flash and splash was closed when i go to the Citylink.  Damn sianz, hope the guy don't so fast get for her. haha..

My granny was another person who is giving headache to me, keep calling and calling, want to sit, stand, walk and she is just too weak to do it, keep calling everyone name, but no one care about her.  Just wish i can leave the house and go home.  haha.. but overall, must take care of her also.        Later will be going to esplande to see the firework, hope everything will be alright.

      today was sunday, and yesterday was really a torture to me.  As what i usually do, stay at my granny house for the night.  And guess what happen last night, my granny was unable to sleep last night, and she is waking up everyone in the family.  She got scolded by my cousin as she is really very.. but overall, after the scolding, she keep quiet for a while and than i happen again, until 4am than alright.  Cannot imgaine if i really sharing a room with her when we shift to the new unit.  Yesterday, message her and ask her whether she want to go to see firework, but i think i'm late, she went to her friends house bbq tonight.  She also told me that someone want to get her a Roxy sling bag, and i was really like, and somemore it a guy.  So what will happen next, i really don't know.  Wanted to send her to her friend house after the firework and it happen to be the BBQ start at 7.30pm to 9 something, it like in between the thing. So nothing to be done but let her go for theBBQ.. quite sad..  Wake up around 9am this morning, saw xiang ying message.  Haha.. she was unable to make it for the firework tonight and now she is in the hositpal as she complained last night her stomach pain as she told me when she called this morning, i was shocked when she told me that she is in the hositpal. Everyone around me is getting sick. Even my sister also, yesterday night, a doctor came to our house to check on my granny, but come to the end, it more than we expected. My sister bone was in the funny shape and she need to go for a x-ray and everything, she cried the whole night and she is damn depressed.  First time ever i see her so depressed, feel so bad.   I still  belive in the what you give other, is twice what will be return to you.  So the people out there, always think that, what you give other, is what you will get back, twice as hard. So Beware! haha..  update later bah! see ya!

After the interview went back to school for the 40th thingy till 10pm.  The thing ended around 7pm but was waiting for the performace.  The Joseph was worth waiting for, very nice.  haha.. Reached home around 10.30pm and take a shower and sit down and watch my fav Jap Show, GOOD LUCK!! yesterday was about the health check and flight assesment, very nice! haha.. I don't mind watching for the third time.  Today went to school for parade, the parade started at 10am, actually don't really want to go one, but need to pass down some stuff to the new admin, so must get my body up to  go to school.  After training, went go with Wei Qiang and Aaron to have lunch and went down to bugis.  Actually wanted to catch a movie, but the time do not fit our time slot.  So no choice, went to West Mall.  The bus 61 was really long, I played the CD for three time.  On the bus was thinking about something.  Than found out that the passion was like getting down, so what is really happening? haha.. i still cannot figure it out and than i just fall asleep on the bus.  Went to west hall walk walk about for a while and than left for home.   Shall end here........... haha......
