         A title that's fitting and true!&nbsp; Here it's midnight, dark, cloudy and rainy!&nbsp; With a dash of lightning- dashing here dashing there.&nbsp; I was struck with lightning earlier- in a metaphorical sense, as I was watching the lightning.&nbsp; I was quite enjoying myself, writing poetry.&nbsp; And now it's spider-mania around here.&nbsp; A fairly large, rather elephantile arachnid stolled along the carpet into our bedroom and up to Dan and Dan quite rightly freaked out.&nbsp; This was the largest spider we've seen apart from discovery channel and horror-movie spiders.&nbsp; Anyway....it's gone now-grossly dead, but gone.&nbsp; And now he's on a spider hunt.&nbsp; Looking under couches and such.&nbsp; Ah well, that means I have the computer for a while!!&nbsp; I'm looking through books on getting money for college.&nbsp; I intend to go to college and hopefully I can figure out what I want for a career!&nbsp; What do you think I'd be good at?&nbsp; Try to think of something unusual that you never hear about.&nbsp; And not something in the circus or anything 'unusual' in that way!!  &nbsp;

       Doesn't it really bite when it's obvious that a manager is blatantly favoring one employee over another?&nbsp; At my job, my manager gives me a hard time about wearing blue, brand new, not pre- or otherwise faded or worn jeans (she says they're not 'dress jeans') on a holiday when there are no patients, doctors or any other employees at work but yet another employee can come in fully dressed in street clothes talking, playing, laughing (and so loudly you can hear her from the front when she's in the back room) and even bouncing a ball up and down in the hall when another doctor is seeing patients!!&nbsp; Yes, this seems totally fair.&nbsp; This employee&nbsp;actually&nbsp;fell on the floor laughing&nbsp;the other day, right behind me while talking to the manager, in full view of patients!!&nbsp;   HELLO  !&nbsp;&nbsp;It's quite disgusting!!!!!&nbsp; What would you recommend be done? Maybe if I become loud, obnoxious, silly and do nothing but play constantly- I'll be her favorite employee (but then I'd have to hang myself).

      I have updated my blog and it's beautiful now!  Thank God I have Dan to show me how to do all of these neat tricks.  Awesome fonts (can you guess what this font is from? Hint it's a 'dark' T.V. show).  And anything that glows is awesome!  Anyway... It's been   really   hot here today!  And it's only going to get worse!  Yuck!  Where's fall when you need it.     Nothing too interesting has happened.  Zach's coming over in a little while and he'll probably make me watch another Hell Raiser movie.  Ugh!    If you're looking for a movie to see, Spiderman 2 was very good!  And Tobey McGuire- though he has a girly voice, has a very manly body!  Ok- I'm going now to dunk my head into a bathtub full of icewater-    later!

        How can there be so many things that  can cause us to be attracted to different people?  One person we've only heard over the phone, another we've only seen and heard on TV, another we've only seen walk by a few times; we are attracted by sound, sight, smell, and they seem to all be separate sometimes!  It's very weird to me.  It should be the combination, but sometimes it isn't.  You can see someone that you aren't very attracted to, but them hear them speak and/or smell them and suddenly you are; or various other different ways. Very strange.  I only think of this because of Ewan McGregor, who I love, but not until I heard him sing.  Then I noticed how handsome his smile was and how many cute moles he has!!  But I just never really cared for him before.    And if I met him- I probably wouldn't be as attracted (or at least Dan would hope!!- and hey, he's got Jennifer Garner as his onscreen love.)  Anyway.... Please give me your comments on this!!

       Zach and my party nearly crashed and burned! Almost noone that I invited came. Bastards. I gave everyone almost a week notice! The only people that showed (besides Zach, Darren, Dan and myself) were Justin and Josh and their friends. Two of their friends that I invited didn't even come!! I had told Justin not to invited anyone without asking me but they invited 5 people anyway, which turned out to be a good thing. It's really sad that the people I did invite didn't give a shit to show. Don't mind me, only a little bitter. Anyway, most friends suck; oh well, we're all bad friends sometime in our life to someone right?

         I've been preparing for a party that's supposed to be happening at my house this weekend. Will anyone show? I know for sure of four people that will be there: and that will be me, Dan, Darren (we three who live here) and Zach. Now I've invited at least seven other people- we'll see if they show! I refuse to believe- that away I can't be let down too hard. But I do hope that my planning and efforts will not go unrewarded!! Anyway- I'll post again after the party to let everyone know how it went!!
