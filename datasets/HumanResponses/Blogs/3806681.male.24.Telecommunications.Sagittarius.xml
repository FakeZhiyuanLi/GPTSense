      Thats what we all want to know right? Each day we wake up and visit the mirror, wondering what the day will bring and what we will be like. Yeah. Something like that.  Well lets see, im 24, a good ol taxpayer of the USofA. Born and raised in Oregon. On the surface im a cool guy. Not many enemies but lots of friends. I'm laid back, easy goin, pay my bills, own my home, have a good job, never been married and have a phat ride. I enjoy sports, anything outdoors, snowboarding, music, goofing off, just anything that makes me forget about work and responsibility. Raised a Christian and I still adhere to it, its my faith. At least whats left of it.   Under the surface is a different story I suppose. I'm still a cool guy. I still value things, friends and family, honor and respect. But things in my life have made it difficult to stand firm, to make myself solid. I have alot of hate, anger, and pain inside. Not at generalities, but at past experiences. The things ive seen happen to my family, my friends, and myself ... burns me inside. It's been 7 years since it all started. Since I began building that wall around my heart and bottling up all the hate. Watching from the sidelines as one thing after another hit me. Am I going to snap? Am I going to breakdown and end up on the front page? Doubt it. No matter whats inside I would still sacrifice my life for my friends or family without hesitation. That would be an honorable way to go instead of hitting the postal button and causing more chaos, right? I think.   Its a strange thing. Jesus taught us to have love for our neighbors. How can I be a Christian when I have such intense hatred for certain people? Have I failed that command? Who knows. Thats what I see in the mirror each morning. Conflict. Conflicts of my beliefs and raised perceptions against my past and what i've become.   Ohwell. Life is, life. It makes us who we are. Our surroundings, our parents, the generation we grow up into... all of it shapes us, molds us. No matter what we take in mentally or spiritually, there will always be a part that makes us unique individuals. The tricky thing is that part isnt unique from birth. It gets developed by society or experiences. Sure we may have some persona quirks from the ma n pa, but even those dont get tested until our impressionable teen years. The years we begin to question with WHY's, and HOW's ...   Ohwell. Hehe, thats been my motto lately, "ohwell". Used to be "What doesnt kill you, makes you stronger" ... yeah, in my case its made me more spiteful, hateful, the pain getting worse.   Ohwell ...
