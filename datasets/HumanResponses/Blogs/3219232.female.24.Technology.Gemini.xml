      Damaged by Plumb  Dreaming comes so easily 'Cause it's all that I've known True love is a fairy tale I'm damaged, so how would I know I'm scared and I'm alone I'm ashamed And I need for you to know I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say And you can't take back what you've taken away 'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say And you can't take back what you've taken away 'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me Healing comes so painfully And it chills to the bone Will anyone get close to me? I'm damaged, as I'm sure you know There's mending for my soul An ending to this fear Forgiveness for a man who was stronger I was just a little girl, but I can't go back

      Should I stay or should I go? I've been contemplating on this matter for almost a week now. Tomorrow will be the final day for me to give my decision. It's comforting and safe to stay and a risk to go. But if I stay in this confined safe state, I will not grow. It is a bit scary to embark on another journey when for some time I have grown accustomed to this environment. But then life is about different journeys and taking risks. And the only way to survive and remain strong is to have faith

      I've been reading the beautiful writing of my friend Margie and have kept a Journal in another website. It's only now that I've decided to set up my own blogspot. Sit back, relax and I hope you guys enjoy the entries of what my seemingly simple life has to offer.

      My birthday is coming up and I’m about to turn 24 years old. What lies on the other side when I cross my birthday? I’m nearing the quarter of my life, although I don’t think I’ll reach the age of a hundred. I’ll probably reach the age of 50 then die. Have you ever had a gut feeling that you wont grow old? I have. I don’t know if it’s because of a sickness like cancer or something because of the way I’ve treated my body (I’m trying to take care of it now by the way-trying to keep a balanced diet everyday with all the food groups and stuff and trying to get myself to exercise). I don’t know if it’ll be an accident-getting run over by a car or I’d die a hero because I’ve saved someone’s life. Who knows?  I’m 24 and I’m thinking about death or rather, abotu dying young. Death is such a dark subject to some people. Morbid and very negative. But then there are philosophers that think it’s not. It’s the end. So what do you do? Live like you’ve never lived before. People have trouble understanding that previous sentence. I mean, how do you really live? SHould you take this in a literal sense? Well, I'm not being literal. How you live really depends on your own beliefs, what you’ve been taught and the choices that you make in your life. I don’t think there’s anyone who can really tell you how to live and anyone who can judge and criticize how you’ve lived. All the things you've learned are there to guide and not to dictate. Your life is your own-not theirs. It’s only sad that some people or perhaps a lot who aren’t aware of this fact.  I’m only glad that I’ve been blessed with a mind that is open to understanding, though limited, it still tries it’s best. And I’m also glad that I’ve been exposed to people, books, and experiences. Experiences that in certain instances were troubling, sad, peaceful, wonderful, sweet and mad (insane). Altogether, they are enlightening and very entertaining. I mean it’s not common to experience a death threat at the age of 16 from your own stepfather now is it? It’s also not common to discover that your physically blind best friend can see more about life than those who have their perfect eyesight now is it? And the list goes on…So many and yet there’s more to come. I feel like so much has happened already. But even if so much has happened, I can never say "been there, done that" the same way that I can't say that I know everything that there is to know about life. I've learned so much and there's more! So what’s in store in the age of 24? Hmmm…we shall see…

      I’ve always dreamed of having a life elsewhere. A foreign country far away where I could write my short stories and novels. Perhaps I’d live on a beach or in some vineyard in France, although I’ve never been there. I’ve been so taken by the places that I see on travel shows, movies, pictures and sceneries described by the books that I’ve read. Often times I want to escape my life here and constantly, I try to escape myself. Why can’t I be satisfied as to where I am in my life for long? Maybe it’s just part of human nature to keep wanting and thirsting for more. What is it that can truly satisfy us? Of course the answers to this question varies depending on what the individual truly desires. I look at certain people and they seem content. Perhaps contentment is a state of mind that I just have to master. Be content with your own situation by recognizing the misfortunes of other people. Seeing what I have as opposed to what I don’t. That may be calming for a short period of time and wanting will then again persist until such time that it will become hard to resist.   There’s this voice inside of me claiming that I am destined for more. Even with the loudest of noise surrounding me and filling my ears, it would shout and see to it that I hear, making it difficult for me to ignore.. It tells me over and over that this is not it, there’s more. Most of the time I listen and then I dream and that’s when I start dreaming again of a life elsewhere. Feeling stuck, I drown those dreams in alcohol to escape the constant pounding of restlessness. I wake up the following day with a hangover and then the voice starts to nag once more.  Will I do something to stop its nagging? Yes. I have to and I fear that if I don’t, I might later on start blaming the people around me for the great things that I should’ve become and bitterness will consume me. Or I’ll just altogether blame myself and sulk at the opportunities lost.  Time can never be put on hold and procrastination wastes it. No matter how much I try to fight this voice within, it will never shut up. There is no one else to shut this voice but me. I’ve been at the crossroads for far too long. It’s time to start walking and instead of this voice nagging at me, it will perhaps start talking and I’d have a decent conversation with it instead.

      When I’m in a dark mood sometimes I wonder what it would be like if I died the following day. I try to enumerate the people who would cry and miss me. Would they weep in my wake and after I’m buried, would they still continue to? Maybe some will and some wont. I don’t know. Life goes on. I’m not expecting them to weep for the rest of their lives. They’ve got their own living to do. Will I be remembered? How will I be remembered? Have I done things that are significant enough to touch their lives?  I think I’ve tried to live my life fairly the way I can. I think I’ve helped people and tried to be an existentialist. I’m not really sure if I’ve done the best that I could because sometimes, I’m so jaded and consumed by self-loathing. But since I’m a contradiction, I bounce back and look on the brighter side of things. I mean what else could I do? I don’t want to be dark and pessimistic all the time. I find it such a drag when I come across people like that. I can’t say that I’m pretty little miss sunshine. Hell no. But I’m not a dark person either. Well, I can’t really understand myself sometimes. So when I die, are there people who have actually understood me? It doesn’t matter. No point to it. I’m just trying to live life the only way I know how.

      Took a friend out last weekend. She was feeling down.  We went to a friend’s bar trying to avoid the “scene” and responding to the lure of an open bar on Johnny Black scotch. I’ve always been in good company with Johnny B. He’s a favorite among friends, specially mine. Johnny B. gave a good hit after 3 glasses so I decided that it was time for a beer. Went to the bar and got myself a nice ice-cold bottle. My other friend took me aside and introduced me to a group of people. And without warning, my hit deserted me. There he was standing and smiling. He thinks that we’ve met before, but to me-I don't think I've ever seen him before in my life. Nevertheless, I lied and said the same. We had started conversing when this idiot former love interest of mine butt in. So I quietly left. I didn’t get to see or talk to him after that. He stuck to my head the rest of the night while my friend got drunk and threw up. I’m wondering if I’ll ever see him again. It’s been a while since I’ve had a crush. I've got a silly smile stuck on my face. It feels light, dreamy and nice.

      Office gossip. Damn thing never ceases to exist. And like the many kinds of gossip, it’s as creative as it can be. And people always wonder why there is office gossip. So my answer would be that some people turn their work into their lives. It becomes so boring that they would have to add spice into it. So the spice would have to be gossip. It’s like the work place becomes a soap opera or some tv show and the gossip is the story line. Work can only be interesting if it’s your passion and that if you’re a workaholic but to a lot of people it becomes routinary and boring. So gossip adds the humor, the drama, the conflict and to sum it all up, it adds excitement. It’s terrible if you become the subject of the nasty rumors around, but I tell you, every person is a subject at some point. Gossip circulates and everyone gets picked for a story line or two.

      I have been going out too much. I was out almost every night last week.  And what do I get? A fever and a very bad sore throat. Been drinking and smoking too much. So I stop them altogether. So my life basically turned into endless days of waking up, going to work, going home, watching tv and writing in my very personal journal. Well, it’s just a small notebook containing the many thoughts that I have each day that I don’t wish to show or share with anyone. If anyone read it, I might as well be dead.    Anyway having a mind that is utterly restless and needing constant stimulation-be it from a philosophical conversation, tv and movies, I needed another drug to sort of keep it preoccupied (even if it always is.) And that drug of choice are books. I had nothing new in my room so I started to read the book “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” again. The story remains the same. I never really expected it to be different, but what I find interesting is that arguments and points made by the writer made sense in different ways. I find that books can sometimes be like a kaleidoscope. They offer different views and all the while they can be found and contained in just one thing.  The probable explanation for this is that I’m getting older. Arguments and points become more interesting and complex that I have to constantly debate on the different ideas that occur in my head. Sometimes I think that I’m going nuts. I have to tell myself to relax because too many thoughts are racing through my mind. So I tell my mind to go blank. It follows for a while but it only lasts seconds and then it’s back to its thought processing again. It’s only books, music and the beach that calm my mind and altogether. If they did not exist, I would’ve run my head into a wall and knocked myself unconscious.

      I've always tried to make sense of the things I've done.  I've done a number of spiteful things. Vengeance was mine-I thought. Perhaps doing what I did out of the pain and anger that I was feeling for those who have hurt me. I thought I was going to get some form of satisfaction-something that would help my anger cease and make my suffering go away. I only found that the pain is greater when you hurt someone instead of getting hurt.  So I embarked on this journey towards forgiveness and letting go. Accepting my mistakes instead of trying to justify them. And learning to forgive myself and know that I do not deserve the situations I put myself in and that I deserve the best. After a long time walking under a gloomy cloud, the rays of the sun were starting to penetrate to shed a bit of light on my dark depressed being.  But it's not that easy. Light has been shed but faith will still be tested. I sometimes think that I'm a bad person trying to be good. Situations are presented to question if I can actually be a better person. And they're there constantly threatening to push me back into self-loathing and seeing everything in gray again.  I'm desperately trying to change and put my life in order. I only hope that I maintain the strength that I have found. I want a better life-I want a good life. It's simple to write and say but it's a struggle to obtain.

      Took a very short vacation after I resigned from my job. Celebrated my birthday and turned 24. Stayed in bed the entire day after drinking with friends at a small party I threw at a friend's bar the night before June 1st. Wondering what was in store-as with my last entry. Made decisions and I'm trying to stand by them. A bad girl trying to be good is how I see it to be.  I was contemplating on postponing my starting date with my new job but decided not to. And so I went to work the day after my birthday. For the past few days, I've been nothing but busy busy busy with learning what I had to do and I've been overloaded with information. Too much information that left my heading spinning. Although, I'm not complaining. This is what I wanted-to be busy and keep myself-more like my mind preoccupied. I wanted to change my work life and partly my lifestyle. It's time to move on to better and more fulfilling things. I'm finally moving. I've finally left the sinking boat.

      On my way home last Saturday,&nbsp;he played the song: Anna Begins in his car. I’ve always liked listening to this. I remember for about a month how many years back, August and Everything After was the only album playing in my car. For some reason, Counting Crows made me feel mellow. It relieved me of the stress from driving in this country-It helped me cuss less at the idiotic motorists that I would come across. I didn’t pay much attention to the lyrics of their songs, but since they sounded good, I sang them anyway.  But for some reason that Saturday afternoon, that song struck a nerve. The lyrics hit me in a way that never did before. It made me realize that I was in a situation that I was not ready to handle. I thought I could because this was not the first time I’ve ever been in one. I have developed a defense mechanism that prevented me from getting emotionally involved. I’ve always been a carefree person and it was always about having fun-no strings attached. Whenever I felt that things were getting intense, I would retreat and move on to other adventures. Things were easier that way. I’ve worried far too much and been disappointed over and over. So I’m sick of it and I’ve pretty much had enough. Never put your feelings on the line. It’s like gambling where the stakes are high-it’s either you’re a big winner or a sore loser and it’s hard to earn back whatever you’ve lost. And I’m not ready to take that risk-well at least, not yet.  I know that life involves a lot of risks and if you want to live and grow as a person, you’ve got to take them. I don’t know when I’ll be ready. I’m still trying to build a relationship with myself and this situation isn’t helping. Oh, and it’s scaring the shit out of me! I have to get myself out of this before it gets any deeper. But I’m sure that eventually, I’ll be brave enough to take them again-knowing very well that I’ll be strong enough to handle whatever pain those risks might entail. I find that it is essential that there are times that we should take risks and there are times that we should avoid them. It’s all about knowing yourself and allowing yourself to grow at your own pace.     urlLink http://www.songlyrics4u.com/counting-crows/anna-begins.html    &nbsp;

      Good dreams are supposed to leave you feeling good when you wake up. But I find that not all dreams leave you feeling that way. Because when we wake up, we realize that it’s not real. So instead of a good morning, it feels like we woke up on the wrong side of the bed. The thoughts that are buried deep in the recesses of our subconscious, more often than not, come out whenever we dream. We try so hard to keep them out of our minds through distractions but when we dream, these thoughts somehow escape the cages where we lock them in. Dreams provide us with a reflection of the truth about ourselves, our conscience, what we desire and long for.  Sometimes we use sleep&nbsp;to escape ourselves, our state and to pass the time when we are going through something difficult and when we are depressed with our lives. But it’s actually dreaming that forces us to face our own realities-at least it tries to. These dreams are either the opposite of what we are going through, which make them good, or they are nightmares. I only find the good dreams, which are the opposite of what our reality is, far worse than a nightmare. These good dreams do not inflict terror, but rather, they inflict pain and sometimes unbearable sadness. In our dreams, we get what we want, but&nbsp;when we're awake,&nbsp;we don't.&nbsp;So how can we escape when our dreams won’t even allow us to?  A dreamless sleep can only be possible through sedatives-well, at least in my case. The seemingly countless days and nights pass by steadily. It feels like being on a raft riding the soft waves of an ocean, drifting towards nowhere. The ocean feels like an infinite body of water. It’s a nice ride but it can’t last forever.  I guess no matter what we do, we cannot escape the reality where we find ourselves in-no matter how hard we try to deny it. Our life is what it is and we are who we are. We can always find numerous distractions and make countless excuses but where does that really take us? We have really no other choice but to acknowledge and deal with it. Once we do, then our good dreams&nbsp;can in fact be true and leave us smiling when we wake up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Don’t you sometimes wish that you’ve never met certain people in your life? Or worse-you wish that you or they were never even born. Some people just seem to spell trouble or pain. Most situations that involves them makes you think-I don’t need this shit! And you wonder if their sole purpose in life is to annoy or piss you off. You think that you were better off without them.  But are we really better off without them? I don’t think that’s always the case. These people-no matter if they seem like bitches and assholes are actually there to help shape the people that we ought to be. It’s always a choice on whether we decide to turn bitter, bitchy, mean or whatever repulsive being you could ever think of. But ultimately, if you look at it in a different perspective, they’re there to make us better people. It’s like they’re there to intimidate and challenge us to become the greatest individuals we can ever be. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  (I’m not yet done. I have to go for now. I’ll continue this later on.)&nbsp;&nbsp;

      One of the hardest things that we have to deal with is our own demons. Our demons are born every time we do not know or refuse to deal with something terrible that happens in our lives. Often times we choose to ignore them-pretending that they do not exist because their arguments are too heavy and difficult to deal with. We pretend that everything is alright and drown them in alcohol, drugs or whatever poison you choose. But in one way or the other they manifest themselves in different ways that other people can see except you. And you wonder why people react the way they do towards you, do the things you do and that you can’t seem to get what you want and truly deserve. Sometimes the most difficult person to see is yourself. Blinded by denial, self-pity, anger and fear, we can’t accept our own faults because it hurts too much to face them and that we have no clue on how to deal. We think it’s easier to turn our backs, unaware that we are sinking deeper into the black hole that we created for ourselves. And we slowly but so surely hate ourselves-letting self-loathing consume us. The light within us that once provided warmth and comfort is starting to fade. We become lost. So we start on the path towards self-destruction. We figure that if we didn’t care-things would be easier. If we numb ourselves enough-nothing can ever hurt us, thus becoming untouchable-or so we thought. We unintentionally or intentionally isolate ourselves and we then experience unbearable loneliness.  Concerned friends and family may tell you things that you refuse to hear because people, more often than not, do not like to be criticized. We can be very stubborn sometimes and we would rather be on the right than on the wrong. Also, no one else knows ourselves better than we do so why should we listen? Listen, because sometimes they actually know better.&nbsp; As much as I hate to admit it, they can actually see things better because they are not as emotionally involved the way we are. It doesn't necessarily mean though, that they are always right. Only we can truly know what is right for ourselves. We can always listen, weigh their reasoning and choose to either heed their advice or not. Emotions can cloud judgment and it’s the alarm that triggers our defense mechanism. And once they’re up, they become a barrier that no one can ever break down. The voice of&nbsp;our demons drown the advice of our friends. &nbsp;  No one can ever help us except ourselves. It’s a struggle to rid the demons we ourselves created. It’s a choice on whether we choose to remain in pain and denial or to acknowledge our faults and decide to change. It’s not an easy process and we always run the risk of falling back into our old ways. Still, no matter how many times we stumble and fall, we must hold on to the belief that we can be better, we deserve a better life and that we can in fact, be happy. If we believe something strongly enough, it can come true.

      I woke up in cold sweat Thursday morning with my heart palpitating. My mind was racing and I thought I was going to pass out. I lay in bed willing it to go away. I told myself to relax-wanting desperately for it to go away. Could I die? Will I die?-were the thoughts that kept running through my head. I told myself no.  After 3 hours being in that state, I was exhausted and I fell asleep. I woke up in the afternoon calm and relaxed. I asked myself-what the hell happened? Did I have a panic attack or something? Was that brought about by stress? What? My body always tends to act up under stress-complications here and there. I've been in and out of hospitals. The Doctors couldn't always figure it out. I've always been a sickly person-weak and unfortunately, easily afflicted. Sometimes I think that it's a miracle that I've survived so many illnesses. I guess my will to live is stronger than I think.  I was not able to go to work so I stayed in bed all day and watched television. I kept my mind blank and let myself be absorbed by the movies and different programs being aired. I was tired of trying to make sense of what happened.  The afternoon passed and evening came. I was becoming restless and decided to run through the latest magazine that my mother got me. I came across certain articles that gave a common idea-never give up your dreams no matter what. I put the magazine aside and watched a program on television. The episode on the program gave the same thing.  This was something that I could no longer ignore.  Do you know when life gives you a million signs and that more often than not, you choose not to see them? Eventually the signs grow bigger and bigger, louder and louder, and they finally hit you. Well, in my case, it was this episode that I experienced this morning. My heart was pounding the threat of death and when I grew calm, it was the television and the magazine that gave me a nudge and told me-hey! Stop wasting time and figure out what you really want to do with your life and live your dream! Death is always lurking and there can never be certainty. One of the worst things that people do is to have their dreams unlived.

      It's been a while since I've been attracted to someone. Met him under the oddest and not the best of circumstances and found myself engaged in a very interesting conversation. I started the conversation with a weird question that people would normally not know how to react to or would rather ignore. I spoke my mind and he entertained it and through the course of it, I formed the impression that he was a very open-minded individual that is unique in the sense that he's very liberated and had the funniest of opinions to share. I find that few people are, even if they try to act as if they were-sort of pretending to be unpretentious and carefree.  So in this sense I always have my guards up whenever I converse with people. Anyway, he surprised me and I found myself thinking of him for the past few days-wondering when I can share the deepest, most absurd and casual conversations with him again. I’m looking forward to it, but I hate thinking about it. As much as I do not want to admit it, I like him more than just a simple crush. I loathe this feeling. The situation that I am in right now is precisely what I have been trying to avoid for the longest time. And I am desperately trying to make it go away. These are the beginnings of heart ache. I know that relationships don’t necessarily always lead to pain, but I would rather not take the risk. I’ve taken far too many risks and more often than not, when I allow myself to fall, I wind up broken. It takes such a long time to piece myself up together again and regain strength and I’m just so tired of that. And I’m trying to figure out means and ways to prevent myself from getting any deeper. Distractions are always good to keep myself preoccupied and his absence helps. I dread and yet I long to see him. Shit! I hate it! He's not even cute!

      Do you ever experience those days where you ask "Can someone just shoot me and get it over with?" Time is moving fast but at times it feels like it's so slow. The days drag on and you wonder when is all this going to end? Sometimes I long for death and yet I've escaped it a couple of times. The only probable reason why my life has been spared is that I still have to do something before I die. But what is that something!? Could it be that I'm meant to become an influential figure that will change the world?-yeah right. I know that certain actions-no matter how simple they may seem can actually be life changing so I try not to discount them no matter how small they look to me.  I've drafted a list of things to do before I die and so far I've only accomplished one. The list isn't really long but the items on the list can take forever to finish. Still, I'm not giving up. It's not because I find them too difficult but I let myself be lazy. Sometimes I feel like the princess of procrastination. I keep putting off the things I have to do until the next day. So many days have passed and it's about time that I get my ass of this chair and do something about that list. And then perhaps once I get the items on that list done, life will let me rest.

      There is a black hole inside sucking the life out of me. Troubled and isolated-longing to escape myself. My skin feels tight and constricting. I try to find comfort in the company of friends, books and television. Sleep is always good but sometimes the demons find their way into dreams. Distractions help pass the time. Some are worthwhile and some waste moments. No matter what I do, I cannot leave me. My body contains this soul-a soul restless and in pain. The soul cries while the body smiles. More often than not, the body is ashamed of what the soul feels and has mastered the art of facades. I try my best to be strong. Deal with shit, fall down and stand up again. Struggling with a mind that thinks too much. Continuously trying to make sense of things and always trying to look on the brighter side even when life is saying that it's the end of the world. My friend once told me that "life is how you see it"-I agree. What you project to the world is what life will reflect back to you. So I try to remain possitive. And I'm tired. I'm tired of the weight. I've always remained independent but now I have to admit that I need someone to help me.

      It’s been a while since I’ve written an entry. Been busy with work lately and turned into a machine. The pressure at work is increasing and the challenge-oh yes, it is challenging. I asked for it and well-I got it. My personal life has been quiet lately. Guess I got tired of the drama so I don’t get myself into crazy situations anymore. Or perhaps, I’m just getting older. I know what’s possible and what’s not. I now know what I want and what I can’t have. I’m more realistic and somewhat jaded. There still is a glimmer of hope that resides inside but it’ll take a lot before it surfaces again.

      I always thought of myself as a person living in the present. I took risks and I was always out to learn and explore more about life. I always kept in mind that things shouldn't be taken for granted because time was not always on your side and chances don't always come in seconds or thirds. Even if some experiences hurt, they shouldn't prevent you from taking more. Like a child playing in a playground, no matter how many times I stumbled and fell, I always got up to try every swing, every slide, every monkey bar, and every course that the playground offered. No matter how high the slide was, I had to climb it-curious of what the rush would be when I slide down. I would scrape my knee and bruise my elbow in the process, but I would ignore the pain and continue to play. It was as if the afternoon was my entire life and there was no time to lose. Things were much simpler as a child playing in a playground compared to the world of an adult. And sometimes I wonder if I was still that person living in the present. Yes, I still did crazy things here and there, but am I doing the things that matter?

      There’s a certain sense of calmness that staring up at the stars brings at night. Time seems to stop when I feel the black sky envelope me as I lay on a field or on the sand of a beach. The cool wind blows away the worries that make me anxious, and the problems that cause stress. And the rustling of the leaves or the waves crashing provide me with soft music to calm the soul. Everything feels good and right. I find that the space we are living in is far greater than what our mind allows us to see when we are consumed by the everydayness in the city. I long to feel that sense of serenity again. I remember the different times in my life when I experienced that on the different beaches and fields I lay on. I would be in the company of friends and family, but what I enjoyed the most was laying quietly as they either chatted on or slept. It’s as if I had a private conversation with the stars and the sky.  I would see many falling stars and wish on every one of them. I don’t remember the wishes that I’ve made but only the wonderful experience of making them. It always made me feel like a child believing that dreams can come true. I tried staring at the sky from the terrace of my condo unit. But all I saw was the smog and buildings in the city and felt its enclosure. Though everything is convenient to make me feel comfortable with my lifestyle, the city cannot replace the experience of being in the beach or field, gazing at the stars at night. Such experiences that only nature can provide.
