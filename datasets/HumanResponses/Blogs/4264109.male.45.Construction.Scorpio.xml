      I thought I was ready to go. I had just finished a big remodeling job in Fletcher. An addition on the garage, and an expantion and enclosing of the rear patio. I made enough profit to pay for my big vacation to the Rockies. I was planning on spending the entire month of August in the Frank Church Wilderness in Idaho. As many weeks as I could stand fishing and hiking in the second largest wilderness in the lower fourty-eight. When I decided to come back to 'civilization', I planned to get work in Missoula,MT.  ... a great plan.  The first day on the road my dog Shadow and I were traveling west on I-40. Headed to the Hart family reunion in Springfield, TN. I got to mile marker 335 when it began to rain a little harder. We had just spent over ninety minutes traveling up the ridge that is just west of Knoxville. Driving was slowed because of a tractor-trailer that had jacknifed at the top of the hill and caught fire. Very slow going but I wasn't in a hurry. The reunion wasn't untill the next day and after all, I had weeks to do anything I wanted.  I started down the other side of the mountain just passed where the 18 wheeler had been pulled to the side. Traffic was relatively light and some of the cars sped past me. I was going about 60 miles per hour. At about mile marker 331.5 I hit a deep puddle in the road. My Isuzu Rodeo began to fishtail. I'd been in a few spins before, but never at this speed. What a rush... sideways down the road at 60 mph. I guess I was lucky there were no cars near me as I was all over the road. I had loaded everything into the very back section so Shadow could lie down behind the front seats. Which is where he was at this time. I knew better than to hit the breaks, but tapping them didn't seem to help. I was riding entirely on water.  I was handling the slide pretty well (I thought) considering how fast we were traveling. The car never turned completely around and I thought it was beginning to stabelize. Just then we hit the inside rail. Just a light tap on the left side of the car. That tap sling-shotted us to the other side of the highway and we hit the other guardrail almost head on. The impact was so severe that it broke the front axle on the right side. I have always worn a seatbelt, and it definately saved me from going through the windshield this time. Because of the curve of the road, and the direction of impact, my car flipped over onto the drivers side and skidded down the road another 100 feet or more.  At this point I began to think that maybe I wouldn't be getting to the Rockies any time soon. I can't remember being scared during this untill we came to a stop. I had no idea what part of the road we landed in, but being on a curve and in the rain, I didn't want to be in that car any more. I looked back and saw Shadow. He was shaking, but seemed to be moving around pretty well. I said "Shadow, we gotta get out of this car!"  I had no trouble unbuckling my seatbelt, but the passenger door wouldn't open. I tried the power window and it worked. I realized that my engine was still on and turned it off.The rain was coming in as I stood up and looked out. I was surprised to see a lady standing right next to me. She asked if I was all right and I said I was better than my car war. She asked if there was anyone else inside and I said "just me and my Shadow." I think she thought that that meant I was alone because she seemed surprised when I said I had to get my dog out first.  All my stuff was completely trashed and it was difficult finding his leash. I noticed a bottle of peach schnapps had come out of my now busted op cooler and I tossed it into the pile so the highway patrol wouldn't see it. I didn't want to have to explain that. I finally found Shadow's leash and handed him to the lady. I said "this is Shadow." Man, was he ever glad to get out of that car.  The nice lady was a nurse and gave me some first aid. I had scraped my left arm on the highway and it was completely covered with blood. I was pulling glass out of my skin ten days later.  ... to be continued tomorrow.......................
