      What is spotless mind? A mind without a spot...without a thought, without an aim, without an intensity..... Who doesn't have a spotless mind... think everyone does. An individual who doesn't have a spotless mind is unique. Maybe this people are termed the perfectionist??? Everyone... according to my own definination-- has the unique feature of not being able to comprehend, understand and foresee certain thing in their own very unique way. So as to call the 'spotless mind'. just like my friend now- who is sitting beside me is suffering from a moment of spotless mind, whereby the mind went blank..blank for an entire minute or second. That's known as the spotless moment.

      hi hi...I've just shifted into a new house..have just moved out of the old house for two days. But, I'm already missing it..unsual, isn't it ? I've only stayed there for only a year..knowing a few good friends. Lucky of me to know this people in where I'm now. First of all , the distance is a great advantage for all of us... and of course the people who were staying in the house made a big great difference. But, lucky enough..this new house is going to contain the same people as before.  In this entire fourth year, there's loads that has happened especially talking in relation to the old house. I remembered very clearly that when we (werwer, mel and me) just moved into the house, everything looks great. But then, we came to realise that half of the rooms cannot be locked. Anyway, that's beside my point! Well... the first week was full of surprises... one of those days, we decided to get something from Argos. So, i decided to change and get ready in Gan's room since werwer and me were not used to change in our own room. When i entered the room, i decided to close the room door properly which i never did. As I was going to open the door after changing, i found myself locked in the room. Initially, i thought the room door was just stucked and will be ok with a slight kick form outside. But, it didn't work that way as i asked fla to kick the door. So, there it is... i was stucked inside and getting panicky, irritated and frustrated. Guess what... with this situation, fla asked me :" do you want a pen and paper to write down what you feel". ( very funny...gee...guess I'm doing that now). Mel, Fla and Sha were trying all possible way to help me to get out of the enclosed room... but all effort failed. Then, they started calling my friends.. ee ching, clif, michelle and chin... and the next thing you know, the small little house was crowded with ppl.But, again..everyone failed to get me out of there..i tried putting vacuum wire down the window so that chin can pass me the screw driver from below. Was a funny one , as if there's some big rescue going on. Everything didn't work out..so they decided to call the fireman. So, guess you guys must be thinking that.... a small little van will come. BUT, NO... I saw a big RED TRUCK stopping in front of our house...oh my god, i was stunned... don't know what to say, at the same time... a gush of blood is running thru' my face, the heat burning. I was totally embarassed about it... the head news of the day in my head ' Girl in Shantalla trapped in the room'... that was really funny. Then, all the fireman were outside the room door, asking if I was ok and trying to ensure that everything will be fine. As if I was totally terrified like those showed in the movies. And guess what ppl... half of my friends outside were checking out those cute looking fireman... oh god. That was really an amazing, trilling week... hee.  So then, we went to Radisson hotel for a drink to celebrate my 'release' . I wonder!!!It was a great night out until the pianist started to play some sucky music which he think is cool. Trying very hard to turn on all the old folks sitting around.:) Anyway, think this is the coolest thing that have happened in my life.  It is really nice staying in the house.. although there were things which we were unhappy about. But, still they are lotsa of sweet memories in 44, Ashe Road, Shantalla. I remembered the night during New Year.. we went to Thai restaurant for dinner- think is one of the most common dining place for the 'residence'. It was a good night and we had 'truth or dare' after when we were at home. Trying to prick and pry into each other's deepest side. Was an amazing night, i truly enjoyed each both your company. :) ( sounds dodgy ?) And all the dance session we were up to in Gan's room...when, Fla went a bit off...gee..hee.. all the epileptic moves will be out. Not like mine is better as mel says that it's knee bending exercises ;0 hee...hee... Was fun, I love them :)Still want to laugh when i think about it.  Anyway, this year flies.. everyone started to get into their work near Jan, feb and March. Everyone were trying to work hard towards the exam, stress levels were all up...so guess, was kind of silent. Nothing much was going on... guess I wasn't much in the picture as well since i was busy with work. But, after that, things start to pick up again... when exams are over.. and everyone start to relax more and spending more time together. Together, came along this two guys Gan and Clif. who i talked more to than the lst time i knew them. Basically, this year end fast... but, i will definitely miss those days in Shantalla esp. having a roomate ;)...glad to have all of u guys, hopefully, all of us move forward to a better year ahead of us. Have a good summer !!! ;0)  love,annie
