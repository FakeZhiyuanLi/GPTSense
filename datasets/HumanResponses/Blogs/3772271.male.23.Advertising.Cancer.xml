      okay, so this is what people call "BLOGGING".... mmmm..... it looks and sounds very interesting, even more so cuz i've been wanting to express myself for a long time to someone....  to be quite frank, i don't even know who's gonna be seeing this, or if it's gonna be interesting enough for anyone, but i really have a lot of things to say, lots of jawdropping comments about family, friendship, work, it's a whole freakin deal here in what i call my life.  first off lemme start at the beginning, a quick get to know each other... i live in the notorious city of Tijuana, Mexico, and believe me folks, it is NOTHING like they (the media) put it, there's no ranch, no sombrero lovin', no shitty town that's stuck in the 19th century. Of course there's some of that in the city, i mean, traditions never really die here in mexico, but it is quite frankly a nice little town that's got a great neighbor to the north, lovely and sunny San Diego, CALIFORNIA ! ! !.... jejeje.... i say it like that because it's true, when people from other cities here in mexico come here or hear from us they ask us what's the best thing in tijuana, and we always have to say that the best thing here is San Diego....  anywho.... i said it would be quick, so.... i'm a graduate of CETYS university from the career of Engineer in Digital Graphic Design, pretty cool, ey, i'm this close to getting my degree, hopefuly this fall, and am planning to go continue my studies in Canada, Vancouver to be exact, I'm not decided yet to study FILM PRODUCTION, or 3D ANIMATION in the Vancouver Film School.... any of those two would be great, but for now I've gotta choose one, it's kinda expensive...  well.... that's who i am now, maybe i'll continue later on with all of the drama that is my job and my family, believe me, you don't know family drama until you hear from my family, those mexican soaps are nothin!... jejeje....  hope to see ya later....

      so... it's been over a week, since I started this thing and haven't writen anything here... i wanted to do it every day but it gets complicated, especially because of work, it gets so tiresome that when i get home all i wanna do is lay down and watch tv.  speakin of work, i work at a place i'll call DG, where my boss i'll call GF, i just don't wanna name names... anywho... i've been working there for the past 2 and a half years, it's a digital print and graphic design place. Since i've been out of school this past winter i've been working there full time and am now in charge of the place, the thing is, there's only 3 people working there besides me, my boss - the owner, his sister - administration, M - another designer and me. the office is always a mess 'cuz GF is a complete disaster in everything he does, he's always promising things to clients that he later on forgets to do, or throws them onto us cuz he's "busy"... Most of the time i have no freakin time to rest or breathe a little because i'm always doing some last minute design that i didn't know about or printing these flyers that i didn't know that had to be done already or lying to customers on the phone or in person about the whereabouts of GF or their stuff because GF is out somewhere or he completely forgot to tell us to do something.... I get soooo stressed out sometimes that even at home i'm all shaky, but i need the money, which is not that great by the way.  Last week GF decided to anounce that he got a plan for his cell phone where he can call any certain number all the time without charge so he decided to put mine on there, so now anytime he wants to call the office he calls my cell phone instead so he doesn't get charged, so my cell is ringing all the time, even while i'm at home or at lunch!!!! that's just plain wrong!, can't he just pick up a damned phone and call the office directly!, cheap bastard!!!  wow, i really needed to get that out in the open!.... this thing really works for stuff like this.... cool...  basically that's it.... work wise, because i have to say this too... GF is a pretty damn good guy outside of work, i'm the only one he does stuff for on my birthday or on my anniversary from work, I've had several free meals, including a hot-dog party last year on my birthday and this year he invited me to lunch on my birthday too, and actually gave me a little present... at least that shows something from his part, cuz sometimes when he get's pissed at something that i did wrong i cover myself pretty good, responding that i didn't do something or got that other thing wrong because i had to right that wrong he did or something like that... so...  okay, i'll leave it at that for now on the work side of my life right now, when i get more into this you'll see more of my work related issues, don't worry... jejeje....  bto, over and out!
