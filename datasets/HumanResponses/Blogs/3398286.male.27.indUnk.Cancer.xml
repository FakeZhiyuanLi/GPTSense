       urlLink screenselect.co.uk   While wandering across the web, I came across ScreenSelect, and I'm currently taking advantage of a free 14 day trial.  The idea is that you pay Â£14.99 per month, and in return you can hire as many DVD as you want.  You can only keep 3 DVD's at any anyone time, and it is all managed via their website.   I'm now managing to get round to watching a whole load of films that I have just never got round to see yet.  I'm now off to watch "Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World".......

       urlLink    OK, so here is my new desktop that I have been working on.  I based it on the last one, but I think that it has a overall cleaner feel.

       urlLink Mozilla Firefox - The Browser, Reloaded   If you are still using IE, download this and give it a go - you will never go back.  It's got more features than IE, and you will be less likely to be plagued by spyware.

       urlLink themexp.org   An excellent site with load of Themes, Wallpapers, Logons and Boot Screens to download and use with StyleXP.  There are literally hundreds to choose from, and what's even better is that they can all be downloaded for free.

       urlLink StyleXP   This is the program I used to modify my desktop.  Not only is it a good program for changing the Theme and Visual Style of XP, but it can also be used to change the Boot Screen and Logon Screen.  My boot screen currently says that I'm using "Windows XP Alien Edition".  I will see if I can get a screen shot.

      Have a go at entering "French military victories" into google, then hit "I'm feeling lucky".  For another classic also try "weapons of mass destruction".  Its a credit to the ingenuity of some people - I mean to get the top spot on google, especially with something that has been as topical as "weapons of mass destruction"

       urlLink Rainbow   This clip from the childrens TV show "rainbow" is hillarious.  Apparently it didn't actually get aired, it was filmed specially for a Christmas party, however it is so funny.......

       urlLink swishzone.com   I downloaded the free demo version of Swish the other day.  It's an excellent tool for creating some quite impressive flash animations without having fork out for Flash MX.    I have used Flash MX before, and it is definitely not the most user friendly bit of software available - it is very powerfull, but has a steep learning curve for new users.  Swish however is so easy and intuitive to use, that even a relative novice can be creating Flash animations after about an hour of playing around with it.
