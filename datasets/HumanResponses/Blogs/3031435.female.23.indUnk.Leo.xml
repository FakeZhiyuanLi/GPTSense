      Hello,  I am back in the Mi. Daytona went rather well. I had a nice relaxing time. The view from the hotel was incredible and of course I left my camera. Well its ok cause today I went to the Nasdaq Open in Key Biscayne. I saw 5 matches, one of which Venus Williams was playing against an Italian girl (Chiappote not sure !). I  took a course in college, but I was never a big fanatic of tennis. I am thinking about signing up for lessons on Saturdays since that's my only day for myself. Being at the Nasdaq was great. I had never been to a tennis tournament and I went with one of my friends from work. It was a good because it wasn't the usual thing I do. Well I am off I gotta rest up for work. I am currently working on a new piece so stay tune.  D

      Hello world,  First almost relaxing day in a long time. I just wanted to fill you in on a few things I talked about last time. First up gradschool. :( I got 3 rejections, its not looking good but everyone gets what they deserve in due time hopefully sooner than later. I have been persuaded by my boss to apply to 2 more schools. I am getting on it this weekend. On the other hand my boss is very well connected and has sent people from my job to other countries to work with families and their children. One girl went to Switzerland for 6 months. One of the speech therapists was sent to San Salvador. When I heard about this I was very excited. I would love to go live in another country.So here is the deal the family hires you to work with their child and they fly you and give you a place to stay and pay you. I don't have all the details, but my boss is looking into maybe going to Australia for me. I would either go for 6 months or 1 year it depends on the family. If I do get accepted to gradschool I have thought about deferring my acceptance for 1 year and still leave the country.Moving to Australia is a once in a lifetime thing and I never want to look back and regret I didn't go. So I wait patiently to find out what will be my next move. If your still interested stay tuned for more detail.  D

      Its Wednesday and I feel like its Friday. The week has been long and I am beat. Sometimes I just want to hit pause on my own life. I basically run after the week. I go to work full-time and then I go tutor and by the time I get home all I want to do is sleep. I am going to Daytona on Friday after work that should be somewhat relaxing. I am going to the Peete Pablo concert. I'll try to take some pics and put them on the web. Work is going really well. I am getting observed on Friday by the director of the CARD( Center for Autism and Related Disorders) of UM. Should be interesting? My boss gave him my resume so that I could possibly move to Australia next year if I don't get accepted to gradschool. I haven't gotten any good news so I might be on the other side of the world soon. I had to get a minute to work on the journal before I went to bed. I am exhausted. Peace and love. I'll discuss the whole gradschool and Australia piece in my next entry. Too tired to type.  Nite D

      I got inspired by Suezette to start my own blog. Its been an extremely long day. Came home late got up ealy to got tutor took a nap and went to babysit. Got home at 1am and now I am here writin my 1st entry for my online journal. For those of you who don't know I have been writing poetry and here is my latest piece entitled : Harsh Reality   On my way home The lyrics made me think of you A double-edged sword One side reality One side fantasy Wishing I could blink my eyes and forget Forget you and The space you made In my mind In my heart And within my soul The thing that hurts most is knowing you don’t deserve  Me or The love I feel And I can’t make you disappear Knowing I can’t transfer the emotions to a more deserving soul I’m here stuck with the thoughts of you Feelings resurfacing at a dead end  Hoping and wishing you’ll turn a new leaf But at this stage I need concrete and not abstract Too much time and energy spent With nothing to show, but sadness  I’ve got to dull the fantasy that you’ll change on my account Just when I make strides to enter reality  I get snatched back to the fantasy Where the good times mostly physical Seemed like they would not end Doing more harm than anything But the bad times were painful Etched into my mind for life Constant reminder that I’m clueless Hoping this will be the last experience of this magnitude I must keep faith that I can go on without you Making me unbreakable  D   Last night I met some girls who work for Hpnotiq and I might start working with them going to different clubs and hosting/promoting the drink. Sounds fun and it pays, plus it will be a new outlet to meet new people. So be on the lookout I might get famous. lol  I got my camera out of the shop this week and I am very excited. Tomorrow I am planning to go to the beach and start working on my new hobby photography. Also I might be working on a poetry/picture book so if you have any entried you would like to submit let me know. I might need some subjects to photograph once I take these photography classes so let me know if you are interested.  I am going to end it here for tonight and stay updated for what's too come. My life is busy and filled with all sorts of interesting things. Keep on this channel. D

      Interesting weekend. After the great Friday night outing you think I would try to rest for Monday yeah right. I went out Saturday night to my little cousins First Communion. I had a great time. I met a ton of family members from my mom's side. They came down from Canada. I caught up with all the family. They couldn't believe how grown up I look. One of my cousins who is much younger than my parents used to have a crush on my dad and wanted to marry him(lol!) They used to have me as their little doll and now they have kids.  After the party I went to Micossukee Casino and Gambling. I met up with Stanley and Marc and 2 of Stanley's friends. I had a good time. I lost 5 bucks and I had some free drinks can't beat that. I got home at 4:00am. I was beat.  Beginning of a new day and I don't wake up til 1:30pm.  I did get a wake up call from Daphney, which I was happy about since we haven't talked as much lately. I lounge and remember the dinner for Valerie's(my cousin on my dad's side) graduation is tonight. Also I want to go see Manny before the dinner. I get ready and I head out at 3:30pm. I head to Ft.Lauderdale to see Manny's new apt. Of course the smart aleck I am I get lost. I forgot the turnpike doesn't have an exit for Stirling Rd. and I ride almost 10 exits north before I realize it. I finally make it to her apartment. I love it. It nice and cozy one bedroom. Makes me eager to move to Tampa and decorate my new place. I spend a couple hours there and I then leave for the dinner.  I get there and I see my grandma (dad's side). A couple cousins and aunts. I am happy to be there celebrating my cousin's accomplishment. My grandma and my aunt came from Canada for the graduation. I haven't seen my grandma since december and my aunt for almost 3 years. We catch up and eat the bomb a*% food. A couple cousins are missing, but that is part of growing up. People can't get up and leave they got reponsibilities, others are wrapped up int heir relationships ( I won't say any names) and tickets to travel are not cheap. But its all good. Those that were there had a good time and as long as Val was happy the rest doesn't really matter cause its her celebration.   I will have pics from the events weekend so stay tuned.  D

      Hello,  I've been gone for a minute,but I am back. A couple new things going on. I am in search of a condo/townhouse in the Tampa Bay area and I found a couple places. I am going to Gainesville next weekend for graduation and also Mac's car show (www.skyhientertainment.com for more info) and on my way back to Miami I plan to stop in Tampa and look at some properties. I feel overwhelmed. If that wasn't hectic enough I know have to find a second property in Gainesville. I have my weekend cut out already. This whole real estate thing is much more than I imagined, but I am glad I am learning a great deal.   I have gotten back some pictures from a couple of photoshoots I worked on her is the link: http://share.shutterfly.com/osi.jsp?i=EeAOWTJw5asWziI. I am planning to keep working on the photography gig some more.  I am getting nervous about gradschool. One of the girls from my job suggested I take a 2 wk vacation before starting school , she is in the Masters program for Communication Sciences Disorders at FIU. I spoke to my boss about it and she recommends I just go to my classes with an open mind and laid back attitude and work on projects as soon as  I get them. She also recommended I try to see what books I will need to try to get them and start to read. Back in the days I would have thought she is nuts, but I am taking her advice. She gave me a book on overview of language disorders on children from infancy through adolescence. I am going to start this weekend.  I do have something fun coming up Rory and Andy's wedding. I have found the dress I am getting made and I went looking for the fabric by this weekend I will buy the fabric and take the stuff to the seamstress sometime next week. I am excited. I am going with  my trusty wedding date :Jenny. It will be a nice time to relax and catch up. I am trying to get everything in order as far as our hotel and getting time off for work. The next thing is what will I do with my hair. Let's not even think about that yet. I wil let Monique do her thing she hasn't stirred me wrong yet. Nothing really to complain about. My parents are just too thrilled I got accepted somewhere. My sister resolved her moving issues and is coming home with me next weekend for a week and 1/2. I went to hang ou in the Grove with my girls from work last night.I had a blast we went to Cafe Tu Tu Tango had dinner and drinks, then we went to Fat Tuesdays and had more drinks and last we ended up at Oxygen it was Latin night and come to find out they were having a Playboy swimwear fashion show(could have done without it). I am glad I went. Hanging out with them made me sad when I got home because soon I will have to leave. I love my job and the people I work with. I will be sure to keep in contact with all of them. Hopefully they can come visit.   I am gone. I am going to a First Communion for a little cousin of mine in Plantation. Food, food and more food! Glad to say its been a drama free week.  D

      I can't believe its been that long since I wrote an entry. God knows I have things to say. I have to make an effort to write at least once a week. I am tired and I am still up. I have been working on some of my short term goals. I will be out of debt sooner that I think. I have acess to the phone. My folks went out of town for the weekend so I am enjoying some R & R. Nothing too new going on. I did want to post this poem I wrote and I welcome all commentaries.  Interest   Sparked my interest Conversation flowing Emotion developing And I don’t know you A breath of fresh air in My life full of smoke Unknowingly you have opened my mind Making me believe  In believing When leaving you I fantasize of our next encounter The silhouette tempts my mind Through the ‘beater Reaching for the sky I peek at your love slits Leading to your manhood Analyzing the definition Of your physical So sweet  The site of you Got my mind wandering What talents you hold As you lean down towards me  Your lips uniting with mine Coming back for more  I must depart Though I need  I must wait for a later encounter Hoping the anticipation will be  Worth the wait Cause I don’t like disappointments  D    I am out. I will be getting the pictures from my amateur photoshoot. Be on the look out.  Love Diana

      Well I went to the Youth Fair and I didn't want to spend the money to ride, but my cousins convinced me otherwise.  Its 11:40pm and I am in line for the 3rd ride of the night as I am standing in line with Valerie and Naomie( my cousins) the guy letting people on the ride tells us that he has to run checks on the ride and he doesn't know how long he'll be. That seems odd, but we get out of the line when the lady behind us tells us her sister just called her from the other end of the fair and someone just flew out of a ride. I couldn't believe. I mean it was the same type of ride I was about to get on the Gravitron(for the old skoolers). I ended up leaving at 12:30. That was something else. I don't think I'll be getting on anymore rides getting too old and the heart isn't what it used to be.  Friday was an interesting not only did I get the news from USF, but someone I dealt with called( it was a weird situation i still  don't understand myself). I thought hell had frozen over.lol. I was shocked,but it felt good. I mean he is attractive, educated and I really felt comfortable talking to him. Somehow it died down and yesterday the envelope icon came up on my cell without ringing. God must have wanted me not to talk to him(lol!) I check my messages and I hear his voice he sounded different like he was sick. Well let me get off his s%#$. I don't know if I want to call back. I just don't get it when I first met him I was impressed. I mean he did things that other guys had always slacked on. I mean the simplest thing. Example: If you say your going to call back just do it or don't say it. He would say it and do it. Its ridiculous, but after the past couple years in my dating world that was a big deal.  I am glad to say I am doing Spring Cleaning all around in my finances, education, spirituality and relationship. Just so I don't slip on the relationship I have assigned the Toxic (song by Britney Spears) ringtone to a specific individual. I really believe the ringtone is fitting. That is exactly how he has been for the most part of my life Toxic. I have to say I learned a great deal from that and though I'll always have love for him its best we stay apart(unless God wants it otherwise). Dowloadable ringtones are the best thing to happen to phones.  Today was a so so day. I tutored I am currently working on a project about Germany, Hitler and WW2. What a topic? I got home at 5pm or so and I started a major pre-moving cleaning of my room. I know I sound eager, but I am. I love the job,but I am ready to get into my profession. I chatted with some friends and family and that's about it. All of a sudden I can't fall asleep.  The arm that I got the Tetanus shot for the bite is killing me. Its swollen and painful, which is normal according to my mom. The bite looks much better the bruising is going away and so has the swelling.   I am feeling great about alot of things,but somehow I can't sleep and I am just up thinking. Thinking about all sorts of things like:         1. Why I always meet the wrong men or give the wrong ones a chance?       2. How can I increase my savings before moving to Tampa?       3. Grad school and my performance there      4. Trying to make sure I pay off all my minor debts. Making sure I am debt free           before June.       5. Trying to fit some time for the gym again  Well all I know is that I can only tackle one thing at a time and first I must set some short term/long-term goals, then come up with a plan to achieve and then execute. Through God all things are possible. To get his help you must call on him (I need to work on that). I am going to sign off and try to go to bed. Tomorrow for sure I am going to go take some shots. I haven't worked on my photography since last weekend. I am thinking about either going to the beach or a park. I don't really know what I want to shoot. I'll bring some music and some poetry and get inspired hopefully.  PS: I am really liking the new Usher CD. I'll probably be writing a new piece to the Confessions Song. I       need to give this blog some life. I will work on that.   Love D

      Hello,  I finally got some good news after a long week. First of all yesterday I got bit by a 3yr old at my job. It was painful and that thing was hurting. You know I'm fair skin so this morning I look like I had been beat up. My arm was slightly swollen and bruised and the teeth mark looked like stiches. I went to the doctor and got a tetanus shot to be on the safe side. On to the good news. I GOT ACCEPTED TO USF! YES YES YES. I mean after 3 rejection letters and 3 to go I was getting worried. So I still have Howard and FIU to hear from, but you know how I feel about FIU. So I will be calling Howard to find out and if not Tampa will be my new residence. I feel like a huge relief has been lifted from my aching back. I am going to celebrate. I am going to the Dade County Youth Fair(its a big thing in Miami) tonight with my cousins. Also I must give a couple Bday shout outs to Bianca and to Chello.  Love D

       Great news I got my condo. After a few trips to Tampa I might have found it. We made an offer and have signed a contract and working out the other details. Its a 2bedroom/2 1/2 bath. Its off of Fletcher right behind USF. Its a two-story condo with all tile. The kitchen and bathrooms upstairs have been remodeled. Its on the second floor and has a screened patio with new washer and dryer. I am very excited. I will be looking for a roomate so if you know anyone who needs a place in Tampa hit me up at diaflorez@hotmail.com.    I have great news my camera that I dropped is back. I picked it up today from the place that fixed it. I only had to pay shipping charges (15$). The owner talked to Olympus and got them to do it for free. I am back in business.   Second deal I purchased a new camera its a Minolta for my photography class. It has both manual and automatic setting. I haven't tested it out yet,but I will this weekend.  The photography class is going great. I am learning alot, but the tru test will be when I apply it. I had my 3rd class this Wednesday. He has been assigning hw but you can either bring your own work or you can cut out pics from a magazines. This week's assignment is to create a photograph according to rules of composition. I am excited. Enough about my new obsession.  Moving on to this weekend Memorial weekend. Miami is about to be bananas, but I won't be there. Some of my old CROP kids I used to tutor are graduating and others will be in town from college so I will be visiting them all. Also my family and my aunt'smom's sisters family will be in Ocala for the weekend. I will be joining them. I decided to forgo the usual Memorial weekend tradition of walking down Washington Avenue on South Beach. I will be back on Sunday so I am trying to set something up for Sunday night since there is no work on Monday. Anyone who knows that's rare I try to work on all Holidays. I was the only person who worked Thanksgiving day at work (only 2hrs).   I think I have covered it all. I am thinking about going to Atlanta for the 4th of July if the flights are reasonable. I need to try to get away before I start school. I got a raise at work. Getting ready to go to the wedding next weekend. Looking forward to seeing Jenny.   The relationship department well I'll just leave it at nothing serious riding out the wave til I move. Summertime fun!  Love Always D

      The trip to Tampa was not soo productive, but the nonetheless educational. I am learning the area more and more. I explored with my mom on our own after meeting with the realtor. I have seen many different places and I at the end of the day I had 2 possibles. One that looked so so on the outside, but the inside was all white tile, 2 story condo with 2 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. For those who know me you know how bad the allergies are and how worse they will get so. The tile is perfect. Second one is a townhouse it looks fabulous on the outside like a dollhouse. It has different color doors with matching accents for each home and they are all different.  I started my photography class today and it was quite interesting. I am probably going to get my manual camera this weekend. More good news on the camera tip one of my old CROP students is giving me a digital camera he bought off of someone for 20$. I was soo thrilled when he told me. I think I am getting addicted to the photography thing but its ok. I will see it tomorrow hopefully. He is home(Gainesville) for a couple weeks and Mac will be in town so he will bring it down for me. I am anxious.   I am really exhausted. I got in at 11:40pm from Tampa and had to be at work at 7am. I worked until 4pm and after that I hung out with a friend from work (Saenya) at Starbucks. I had a good time.   That's it I am off to bed.

      Happy Mother's Day!!  Since the tragedy other events occured. I went to Gainesville graduation and I had a blast. Congrats to everyone who graduated and welcome to the real world. I hope you have a plan. I wish everyone the best.  About the camera I took it to the shop that originally fixed it and the lady is going to try to resend it to Olympus as a redo. So hopefully they take it and I wont have to pay anything. I went on the hunt for a second camera since I am taking the class which starts on Wednesday and ends June 16. I found a camera for 132$ and its automatic, which is what I need for the class. My dad will be taking the class with me. I am very excited and maybe I will have enough knowledge to use the automatic to use it at Rory and Andy's wedding.  I took the material to the seamstress to get my dress made for the wedding. I am thrilled my next meeting with her is on the 20th of May. I don't understand how we understood each other since she speaks little english and my spanish is awful and almost non-existent.  Everything is pretty good. I am going to Tampa tomorrow night to meet with the realtor with my mom on Tuesday. Well I am going to get ready we are taking my mom to Melting Pot for mother's day. So I will holla.

      I know its been awhile,but I had an eventful week. I went to my cousin's graduation last Monday after work. I brought my camera of course and I was taking some ill pics. My family and I were outside after the graduation talking and taking pictures when I asked my cousin to hold the camera to take a pic with the graduate. He hands me the camera and I am putting it back in the bag. I am holding both the straps for the camera and the bag when I feel something about to fall I believe its the bag so I don't stress when the loudes sound I have heard is made by my camera falling to the ground. There my depression started I got it and was looking at it, it wasn't in a milion pieces but the zoom would not retract. I cried for the 1/2 hour ride to my cousin's house. I called my dad who said: " Concentrate on driving or you'll crash."   I know its a material thing and I don't want anyone telling me I should get over it. That was my passion. I got it from a friend and it was broken he told me if I got it fixed I could keep it. I searched for a place to get it fixed and I finally did and spent 200$ on it.  I am devastated. I was told I should send it to the company myself that I might get a better deal thans going through the first company. I don't know I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. Olympus sometimes gives better rates for repair to companies with large accounts. I might get charged more. If I sent it myself I am just worried something would happen. I saw another photo place yesterday and I am going to stop by and bring the camera today. Who knows what my happen?   For the past week I have been wanting to write in my blog,but the pain I felt was to strong. To try to understand think about something dear to you a hobby or something else. Imagine never being able to afford and one day someone hand the thing to you and it yours. You take care of it, you are very careful nothing happens to it and BLANNNNNG!!! IT FALLS AND STOPS WORKING THE SAME. I am really hurt and only a photographer can feel my pain. If you'll like to donate to the fix the camera fund email me at diaflorez@hotmail.com.  I am gone

      Well tomorrow is the start of a new semester at my job which means a new work schedule. I won't be starting at 7:15am 3 times a week only once, which I am thrilled about. I will be working with some new kids, which I think only strengthens my abilities to enter my grad program.   I missed a field trip with my photography class because I attended the wedding so I met with my teacher today to have my own field trip. It was a great experience. I learned a great deal about techniques and becoming the artist never being afraid to push the envelope. My teached took a couple shots of me during our work so I will try to have some shots up on the web for you viewing pleasure.  Today my grandma came in from Haiti. I was thrilled to see her, I hadn't seen her in 2 yrs. We catched up and she filled me in about the country. I had a really nice evening and I am glad.  One of my girls is going through some stuff right now and I would just like to send a prayer for her. This is a difficult time for her and I want her to know she is never alone and I love her with all my heart.    Shout Out to Tommy on graduating from Coral Reef High School! Also to Louie and Cliff and anybody else I forgot. Time is flying by. Tommy is Daphney's brother for those who know her. I am very proud of you little brother.  Last,but not least everything is going well with the condo. Tons and tons of paperwork,but I am learning a great deal about home inspections, contracts and the processes of buying your first place. Thanks mom  Didi

       Congrats Andy and Rory!  The wedding was magnificient. Andy looked beautiful. I am very happy for the both of them. Looking at them refreshes my memory that somewhere out there true and pure love exists. Love is not deceitful or hurtful contrary to what most experience. I congatulate them on this important step in their lives they have taken together and wish them many years of happiness.  Going to the wedding led me to some thinking about my own life. No I don't think I should be getting married anytime soon. I am not ready for that and much less a relationship. I have accumulated baggages from previous relationships that are blocking me from being totally ready to meet someone new. A lot of the lessons have stuck and added a negative component to new encounters.Before I can begin dating I must totally clean out the closet. I have been working on that and its tougher than I thought. The fact that I am moving to Tampa does make it a lot easier. The first step is changing my number (if you don't get my new number its on purpose take it as a sign that I am cleaning out the closet and you are dust in the way). I know that all things have to come to an end wether good or bad.   Sometimes people hold on to people or relationships thinking things will have a different outcome, but sadly it almost never does. Holding on the the past does nothing but give you a sense of false hope. You must live through some situations yourself to fully understand it rather than have it be told to you. Nothing like a reality check and I was much overdue for one. I am thankful for everything that has happened over the last couple days; and I am happy to anounce I AM STARTING OVER. This is a transition period and I am going apply the knowledge I have learned from my past. Someone told me today the way you enter a relationship is the way you exit it. That is a truth !  I feel liberated its kind like the scene from "2 Can Play that Game" where she transfers the negative energy to him. I am just transferring the negative energy while filling myself with nothing but positive energy. Reevaluating all aspects of my life. Its all in the process of growing up.    I AM FREE!
