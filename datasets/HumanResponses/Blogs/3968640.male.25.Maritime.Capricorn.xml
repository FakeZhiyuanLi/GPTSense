						   Found this site from Mel's blog.  Hey Mel, thanks for the pic of the cell group too!  Anyway, this site generates  urlLink Elvish  and  urlLink Hobbit  Names from my name.  1st Try:  Input 1st name: Terence Input last name: Goh  My Elvish name: Mablung Falassion  Falassion is kinda cool for a last name but Mablung?  Sounds like something I flush down the toilet bowl - GROSS...  2nd try:  Input 1st name: Weeloy Input last name: Goh  My Elvish name: Gwindor Falassion  That's more like it....Gwindor. That's more like it although I suspect it's one of the smurf's name.... ????   1st try:  Input 1st name: Weeloy Input last name: Goh  My Hobbit name: Bingo Bleecker-Baggins of Fair Downs   Bingo? BINGO!   Bleecker-Baggins? Am I related to Frodo and Bilbo?  2nd try:  Input 1st name: Terence Input last name: Goh  My Hobbit name: Togo Bleecker-Baggins of Fair Downs   Ha! Just as bad.  Just for kicks I tried out my female names:  For Elvish, I got a Eldárwen and a Eáránë Falassion.  For Hobbit, I got a Polly and a Iris Bleecker-Baggins of Fair Downs.  That's it, from now I shall be called Eáránë (pronounced ARE-RAH-NEI) Falassion, Elvish Princess.  Yes, laugh all you want. I still got a cool name plus I was Eowyn for the Lord of the Rings Test.  Better a cute girly than an ugly hobbit (High 5, Kenny)!  (For more middle earth names, please check this site out too.  urlLink CLICK HERE !)  Cheers!

						   You know Singapore Football has hit rock bottom when the only Chinese dude in the team gets the boot from the National Team.   "Tan quits national team after being axed" -  Streats, 22 July 2004  Yes sir, that's Mr Tan Kim Leng for you. You know the guy with the chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in his condo somewhere? Yup, it's him all you envious, red-eyed cretins out there.  How could the FAS&nbsp;do that? Don't they know that the guy represents 75% of the population of Singapore? Very soon, they are gonna axed the Malays who represents 20% and then the Indian (5%).   That will leave us with 0% of our races (if you don't include the 0 point something Eurasian community here) in our National Team. So what are we gonna do?  Simple, just import them from all over the world. We already have guys from Africa, Brazil and Eastern Europe donning the ol' red and white of the Lions, having been granted citizenship for their short stint here.  And&nbsp;they didn't even have to serve NS&nbsp;for that!&nbsp;Just do what they do badly - Kick a ball. When they reach retirement, they can pack their bags, slap their bums and&nbsp;say "Thanks for the money", then&nbsp;laugh all the way back to their native countries.  Thanks for kicking the ball in our turf and taking our money away&nbsp;dudes!  If the current trend of axing our national players continues, the team that represents Singapore at World Cup 3XXX will have none of our native born heroes. It has already happened at Sea Games 2003!   The entire team was made up of dumb blonds&nbsp;with fancy boots who can't score to save their lives. They play as prettily as their pretty hair but they forgot that the goal of the game was to put the ball in the opponent's net. Duh!&nbsp;  Back to the topic of Mr. Tan Kim Leng, the guy with the chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in his condo somewhere.  His sacking came after the recent debacle where the Lions fell again to our neighbours. You know we shouldn't call it a debacle anymore. Let's just call it a tradition. Everytime you hear our boys go play Malaysia, just say, "Oh, we are gonna lose again." :-c  When told of FAS' decision to axe him from the squad, the very defiant Tan retorted, "No problem. I won't go back to the national team. I'm someone who plays with passion, but what do I get in return?"  If red is the colour of passion then&nbsp;Mr. Tan&nbsp;is truly a passionate man (he's got a&nbsp;chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in his condo somewhere, you know). Every match he plays, he sees red. The guy was rewarded for his passion by seeing red yet again in last year's Asia Cup qualifier where we got thumped 4-0 by Kuwait.  Following last year's humiliating 4-0 thumping by Malaysia (you know those guys who always&nbsp;claim it's our fault when things go wrong?) at home, the boys set out across the&nbsp;Causeway to regain some of our pride.  All the signs were looking good for a win for us. We had a full squad while the Tigers had 5 of their regulars missing from their squad comprising mostly of their U-23 squad. Yup, the same fellas who spanked&nbsp;us at the National Stadium last year.   Well, we did regain some measure of pride. We lost 2-0 only this time. Well done, boys! Next time it will&nbsp;be 0-0!&nbsp;  I believed that the match was held at the Bukit Jalil Stadium, a 40-50,000 capacity stadium but only 1,000 spectators turned up to watch the game.  If they tell me that these&nbsp;guys paid for the tickets, I will shoot them. Paying spectators? Bah!  We all know that when any delegation from&nbsp;Singapore goes over to Malaysia, a whole plethora of officials or what have you accompanies along. You know, like excess baggage.  I bet my butt that the 1,000 are made up purely of officials from both sides. We will probably make up 80% of the crowd because we have more money of course. Duh.....  So who are these guys there then?  The Goal 3xxx commitee no&nbsp;doubt.   FAS bigwigs and their family members.&nbsp;They were given complimentary tickets to the game.  Former Goal 2010 officials like Jan Poulsen and his cabal. FAS had thought that our boys would wipe the smirk off their faces and justify their decision to axe them. Of course after the game, these guys still have their smirks and their wallets just as full.  The commitee who sacked the Goal 2010 commitee. They are the ones who suggested that tickets to be given to Jan Poulsen and the rest. They also wanted to see the smirks wiped off his face. So who's laughing now?  The commitee who is going to sack the commitee who sacked the Goal 2010 commitee. The game hasn't been concluded at that point but Singapore very kiasu one you know. They are there just in case.  The various who is going to sack who commitee. The one for Tan Kim Leng no&nbsp;doubt was there and taking tons of notes.&nbsp;  The rest are made up of runners who are supposed to get kacang putih and kua chi for their bosses.  When you add those numbers up, it is quite surprising that their numbers only make 800 of our good folks. Maybe the commitee who is going to sack the 800 did not make the trip. Otherwise they would have doubled the numbers.  My heart would have gone out to you Mr Tan. It's hard to play when you know you have so many eyes scrutinising your passionate display.  But hey, at the end of the day, you still&nbsp;got your&nbsp;chio ang-moh trophy wife holed up in&nbsp;your condo somewhere. Now that's something I will never sympathised with!  Cheers dude!

						   Here's the update on my bro's eternal rat/mouse problem (only in Myammar folks, only in Myammar):   Thanks for your wonderful (and some not&nbsp;so wonderful)&nbsp;suggestions&nbsp;re dealing with my rat problem. It's amazing that the same problem applied to both sexes can wield so&nbsp;varied a result. Here's some of them....  Suggestions from Martians - Lace bait food with some chemicals like bleach or something... might help to kill them... and since the rat actually goes back and i think they regurgitate for the "kids". so if its poisoned... you kill the kids too... i hope (those from ntu and/or cornerstone probably can guess who this brilliant person is)- "Pengkang" some cuttlefish to tempt the rat - Use industrial bait glue.... equally powerful &nbsp;- shud use the cage one, its more expensive but u get the satisfaction of drowning them when u catch them. how u do it? dump the whole cage in a pail of water, best way is to put the cage in the pail and slowly fill u the cage with water. u will see how the rats run about nervously and their last moments when gasping for whatever little air they have left. hurhurhur  Suggestions from Venus - Use sweet food. Feed it lots of sugar and let it die of diabetes. - btw, read in enid blyton (story: the doll that lost its squeak, in case you wanna verify the info given) that rats love wax...so if you've a couple of candles or tealights, that may do the trick.  - Cheese  Morale of Story:  Beware of those from Venus. Even when they are plotting to kill you, they are capable of masking it with tender loving care. Guys you have been warned. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!   &nbsp; My suggestion? Buy a cat!

						   Let's welcome&nbsp;our fellow bloggers:   1.  urlLink Kenny    2.  urlLink Ronnie    3. And the  urlLink Ephraim Express !   Gentlemen, start your blogging........   Let's hear what these&nbsp;folks have to say on their 1st posting:    1. Kenny:     &nbsp;  " So what exactly does BLOG stand for ?      hmmm ... can't believe I'm actually indulging in this frivolous activity. Haven't written a journal in years, and since Friendster is out of fashion (so I hear and the fact that I've gotten only one testimonial since it started - and I'm sure I've got more friends than I imagine ... ), I thought I would join in the band-wagon.        &nbsp;    It will definitely take a while (perhaps a long&nbsp;while...perhaps never) for verbosity to take hold of me&nbsp;again. I've been so used to writing illegibly and in short forms at work that I think short form now. Writing in prose has become a pain.        &nbsp;    So ... since I'm too lazy and nonchalant to read up on this website, perhaps somebody can take the shortcut for me and tell me what BLOG stands for, and what this website is all about, other than the fact that it's a good vantage point from which to cry for help. and while the kind soul is at it, I would LOVE to explain what Womb2Tomb stands for .... "     I have only one word for you, dude:   NEANDERTHAL! HIYOK!   Oops sorry! I am not done yet! Trust&nbsp;the man to make something good sound so bad.   According to Dr. Tan, blogging =   1. "frivolous activity" -&nbsp;this means that all bloggers are a bunch of slackers with nothing better else to do.   2. "join in the band-wagon" -&nbsp;this means&nbsp;that all&nbsp;bloggers are&nbsp;mindless animals who just follow what everyone else is doing.   3.&nbsp; "Writing in prose has become a pain" - this means that all bloggers are pain&nbsp;in the a%%!&nbsp;(This is&nbsp;what he is trying to tell us subtlely, right? RIGHT?)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Somebody shoot the guy man!   And please explain what Womb2Tomb stands for? Please? PLEASE (x10 in quickfire fashion)! Oh please tell me! I am dying to know!!!!!!!   &nbsp;   2. Ronnie:    " Hurray. I starting blogging      I   am 1 month and 18 days post-nuptial. It feels different being the owner of your own place. you get to mess it up anyway you want it (to the discretion of the better half of coz... =P) Darn bored with my work now, no job satisfaction... but the free time is good for adjusting to married life. Wanna thank Terence&nbsp; (you the man!) for ridding the Netsky for me... unbeliveable! 400 over copies on my pc.... Was shifted around OTs for the past 2 days, feel like crap. Sian Not looking forward to work tomorrow... on call.... "      &nbsp;  My comments:   Don't thank me, dude. Thank the Norton Systemworks. I stupidly went to Challenger at Funan&nbsp;and paid $140 for it. Even more stupidly, I went down to the shops below after that to look at the prices that it is retailing at - $120! :-c   &nbsp;   3. Ephraim Express:     &nbsp;  " ephraim-express????      how am I supposed to catch up all these?? I was jus getting the hang of using Friendster...        &nbsp;    ephraim-express??? kenny pls explain... blogger?? wat on earth is that???"     My comments:   Exactly my sentiments - "ephraim-express???? " - I thought it was the 'karen express'?   ;-p Just kidding, gal! Now step aside! I am taking over from here!   Later dudes!

						   My bro, who is working in Burma, sent me this email a couple of days ago. Interesting read:  &nbsp; In the past week, I've learnt:-  &nbsp;  -&nbsp;the different ways to say I love you in Myanmar....&nbsp;Girls give guys handkerchief, guys give girls Ks1,500 (the local currency) either figuratively or literally. So what does this show? That in Myanmar, the guys still get the raw end of the deal :-(  - that in Myanmar, I still can find my coca cola, MacDonald's and KFC, except that it is called Star Cola, Mac Burger and KLCC - I kid you not. Same recipes, same formula:-)  -&nbsp;if I see a doctor in Myanmar, and call myself like U Jaw Danai, it will cost me 50 times less than if I report myelf as Mr Goh Danny :-)  - the mean of "chit say yar lay". It means cute in Burmese. It is also the most common phrase that people use on me :-) HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!  - The&nbsp;modernization of the Singapore medical services can be summed up by taking a look at&nbsp;the knees of my Singaporean colleague in Myanmar.&nbsp;He has had three operations on both his knees. First one left him with a 30 cm scar (normal surgery), second one with a 15&nbsp;cm&nbsp;scar&nbsp;and the last one with a 5 cm scar&nbsp;(microscopic keyhole treatment). Ah, the wonders of science.  -&nbsp;The office phone bill for last month came up to about USD 1,000.....&nbsp;Those that have been sending me large files (those above 0.25mb), I am begging&nbsp;you once&nbsp;to stop sending.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - "Computers for Dummies"&nbsp;Lesson 1: To check file size, right click on file, select properties, see&nbsp;general tab under size. 1,000kb&nbsp;= 1 mb.&nbsp;  - &nbsp;"Computers for Dummies" Lesson 2: Alternatively, to check file size, mouse-over designated file and wait, properties of file will be displayed in a&nbsp;pop-up window.  - "Computers for Dummies"&nbsp;Lesson 3: Mouse-over means moving your mouse to the selected file in question.  - If Lessons 1 to 3 are making sense to you for the first time, good luck to you:-) It may high time that you seriously consider a switch in careers, preferably to one that does not involve the use of computers:-)  - Speaking of mouse, my housemate and I brought in two rat traps to deal with the rat issue at place last week. Not those&nbsp;humane cage kind, those you see in the cartoons with the recoil that&nbsp;snaps&nbsp;the back of the rat. OK, OK, so its pretty cruel - but bo pian, this is&nbsp;the&nbsp;only bloody rat contraption that they sell here.... the cage one is too expensive.- It has been about a week, so far the score is rat 3 danny 0. Lemme see, so far, he has robbed me of one bar of&nbsp;kit kat, a whole chocolate biscuit and some Japanese crackers.&nbsp;  - The recoil on those rat traps are damn bloody powerful. I should know. While setting it up, I accidentally triggered the trap. It nearly left me with a broken finger. Luckily all I had from the experience was a very bruised finger and an equally bruised ego :-)  - I am open to suggestions as to what food do rats like to eat, coz I&nbsp;am seriously running out of ideas:-)  - I am boring more and more people to death with my emails. Getting less and less replies with each email that I send.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  That's all folks (to the tune of looney tunes&nbsp;closing credits&nbsp;song)  Danny

						   8 A.M....   It was&nbsp;the morning rush hour.   I was&nbsp;taking an already packed MRT Train with a hundred others&nbsp;at the same station.   Great!   Seems like at whatever the time, the train would always be packed..  Ok, so I got crammed into the train with the rest of the crowd as usual&nbsp;and as always, I picked a spot to make my stand.  Back off, folks. This is my spot, no one&nbsp;is gonna share it with me.  But too bad, my fellow commuters&nbsp;would never&nbsp;know the meaning of personal space.  Even if there were&nbsp;only mere inches between me and the other person&nbsp;or to&nbsp;whatever I was standing next to, they would still go right in&nbsp;and claim that spot.  Never mind that they&nbsp;would barged into me or would be standing with&nbsp;our bodies touching and their body heat&nbsp;(and sometimes odour) emanating forth to add to my sense of&nbsp;claustrophobia and to the general discomfort I&nbsp;was feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Never mind too that their files, books, bags, brollies and their whole assortment of paraphernalia were making their presence felt on me by poking, rubbing and&nbsp;tickling me at the most uncomfortable places.  You know what?&nbsp;These folks just have no sympathy for their fellow commuters. They are merciless and heartless.   But you konw what too? It's time to fight back!  I thought of an invention that I hoped to get patented within the next few years.  Yup, you guessed it, it's the personal space maker.  Basically, it's a wristwatch you wear on your hand&nbsp;that by pressing a button, an invisible force field will encompass you entirely for up to a radius of 1.5 metres (it might vary with different folks but 1.5m would be the minimum for me).  Anyone who comes near me&nbsp;-  Wham!  Ouch, that must hurt but sorry, you are encroaching into my personal space. Please step back.  Cool, huh? This would definitely be the invention of the century.  Later, man!

						   Lunch went well I guess....  &nbsp;  The Mee Kia was satisfying enough.  &nbsp;   Like Adrian said, "It's just nice. Not too spicy and not too bland. And it's all meat!"     &nbsp;   Pearls of wisdom.     &nbsp;   So back to the office we go, to face the doldrum&nbsp;of work. I forgot my Wadi Time again and I had the cheek to SMS Melvin to do his :p     &nbsp;   Well, at least&nbsp;Adrian&nbsp;was having a field day again. Those blasted truckers were calling in, threatening to rape his father, mother, brother and&nbsp;sister.     &nbsp;   Hokkien expletives in all its glory!     &nbsp;   I had to admired the guy's gutso by retaliating in earnest. It's an art form for him in the highest.   &nbsp;  "#$%#$! You want you go ^%#%#$%. Don't call unless you return the containers cleaned. $#%#$$%!" Good job, dude! That's telling them!  &nbsp;  I had to call the company from Greece to get the money again. I really hate that. Somehow, the distance between our countries was clearly reflected in our telephone conversation which was more akin to a shouting match.  &nbsp;  "HELLO! I AM CALLING FROM HEUNG-A, H-E-U-N-G HYPHEN A! I AM TERENCE! I NEED TO SPEAK TO...."  &nbsp;  "Hello, I can't hear you! You need to speak louder. You are calling from?"  &nbsp;  "HELLO! I AM CALLING FROM HEUNG-A, H-E-U-N-G HYPHEN A! I AM TERENCE! I NEED TO SPEAK TO...."  &nbsp;  This would really test my nerves when it was repeated the 3rd or 4th time. After which, I still had to get round what a hyphen was.  &nbsp;  "It's the "minus" sign. You know, the "dash"?"  &nbsp;  "I'm so sorry but I don't understand,"  &nbsp;  It's worse when you hear your colleagues sniggering in the background. You just pray that the other party would&nbsp;somehow decipher whatever gibberish she was hearing from me.  &nbsp;  Viola, she did. Thank God! Thank goodness!  &nbsp;  "It's ok, we will remit the amount in your company's bank by today,"  &nbsp;  "Thank you,"  Whew, praise the Lord!   &nbsp;  If scum could go any lower then it certainly did when I eavesdropped on Alex and Jaffar. Actually, I didn't have to be so sneaky about it. They spoke so loud I guessed even the whole office could hear it.  &nbsp;  "Alex, you gotta give us new notes otherwise the captain will not accept it."  &nbsp;  "New notes cost more. If he doesn'accept, then how? I keep is it?"  &nbsp;  "Yah lah, I put in my pocket also man."  &nbsp;  Bouts of hearty laughter.  &nbsp;  Yup, I am sure the both of you would pocket the dough and I bet it ain't your first time either.  &nbsp;  The more&nbsp;I look at them the more I just want to leave the company.  &nbsp;  Ok job, good pay but sucky culture.  &nbsp;  Met Jon online, spoke a bit.  &nbsp;  Continuing with my assignment. Looks like I won't meet the dateline. Uh-oh, here we go again!  &nbsp;  Michelle posted a comment. You are welcome, dear. Make sure you bring more guests.  &nbsp;  All right,&nbsp;it's Smallville Time.  &nbsp;  Also time for&nbsp;Wadi(Prayer) Time later.  Signing Off...&nbsp;

						    Monday Blues have leaked into Tuesday.   &nbsp;  I am barely getting by today. Stuck at work with nothing to do. That's why I am inputting this entry :p  &nbsp;  Lunch as usual involved a little brainstorming between Adrian and me.  &nbsp;  "What/where do u wanna eat later, dude?"  &nbsp;  "Anything/anywhere,"  &nbsp;  Same question, same answer.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The monotony!  &nbsp;  We decided to head back to the place we lunched at yesterday. It was the 1st time we went there together.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We thought the Mee Pok/Mee Kia was absolutely tasty so to avoid having to be asked the same question everday, I told the man we should just go there everyday until we got sick of the food.  &nbsp;  "Right on!"

						   So it begins…   So what has happened in the world as I know it before I started this thingy?   1. urlLink Rocket Ronnie thumps the field to clinch the World Snooker Championship for the 2nd time.    Here’s wishing you more success in the future!   2.  urlLink Inter  has appointed a new manager in  urlLink Roberto Mancini .   Of course, this piece of news will only interest Inter fans like me. And I guess this will only matter to me since I am probably the only Inter fan around.   So far, I have only known losers who support teams like Liverpool or Man Utd.   3. Greece won  urlLink Euro 2004 ! No doubt the members from the squad have already been added to the Greek pantheon.   Our dear Lions can take a leaf off them by winning World Cup 3xxx.   Wait! The idea has been scrapped. The goal now is to win Tiger Cup 3001.   What a way to usher in the new millennium!   4. Alex Pagulayan has won the  urlLink 2004 World Pool Championship ! The dude declared it 'The Game I've Been Waiting To Win My Whole Life'.   Together with the mantle of World Pool Champion, he gets to pocket a cool USD 75,000. Of which, 30,000 will go to clear his debts and the rest to feed his frenzy of partying and boozing that will sure to follow after his amazing come from behind victory.   Well done, dude! What a way to spend the greatest moment in your life, to wake up the next day with a nasty hangover and with zero in your bank account.   Cheers to that dude!   5. Our Lions have lost to Malaysia again following last year’s 4-0 demolition job by the Tigers in the Lions’ Den.   The good news is that we lost only 2-0 this time.   Next time, it will just be 1-0 followed by 0-0 the following year. Who knows, we might beat them someday.   Yeah, right…   Coach Raddy blamed the defeat on the referee. When we got spanked 7-0 by Oman last month in the World Cup Qualifier, the ball was at fault (poor thing).   So who is he gonna blame next? My mother?   6. I think the best thing I did today was to SMS Rachel to thank her for bringing me into the Music Ministry. Never thought of that until now.   Thanks, sister! Now I can do what I enjoy most, karaoke worship style!   7. Adrian just informed me that Smallville starts at 10 PM instead of 10.30. No wonder I thought the show was getting shorter nowadays. Duh….   8. Another season of Alias has begun and I am a few episodes behind already. Wait up Jennifer, I am coming!   9. Coffee never smelled so good until you decided to quit it.   Yup, my life as I know it is going the way as it should.   Here’s wishing for more good times ahead.   Cheers!

						   Keith Andrew Morton Born     : 5th June 1979 Departed : 15th August 2004     This was someone I know from my secondary school days although though he was not from my school or that i know him that well.  The epitaph above were his actual words in "Friendster".  His story appears on the Straits Times 16th August 2004,  P3 .  urlLink [Click Here]   I met the guy only a few times before his passing but I always thought he lived his life as he said he said he would.  A few years ago, my football team beat his team 5 - 1 when he was not around. They beat us 2 -1 the next time round when he played. Since then my team mates have always been talking about him.   He was one heck of a player.  I learnt from people close to him (and this was also reported in the news) that he had just returned from cooking school in England and was starting his own restaurant soon.  I heard he was one heck of a cook.   Pity I will never find out how good.  I thought he was one heck of a person.  Those who know him mourn for him deeply. So do I, even though I do not know him well.  His passing has left a void in many people's life for he was the light in many people's life.    His passing is like a candle snuffed out too soon to leave the world a little less brighter.  Rest in peace, Keith.  May angels watch over your sleep.

						   The sun crept up the Andonean Range, scaling to the summit in labourious fashion. Light trickled lazily into the bamboo forest below, nibbling away at the fringes of the departing dusk. As the sun reached its zenith at the top of the highest peak, the creatures of the day awoke to the rebirth of the sun and then the place suddenly exploded into life.  Light poured into the forest like a ferocious wave, revealing the forest in its most resplendent glory. It shimmered like a green emerald at the foot of the mountain, pristine and bright. If the Andonean was a king, the bamboo forest was like the finest cape he wore. And if the sun was God, He was surely bestowing all His glory upon the forest with His light.  Any traveler standing on the top of the Andonean would surely have been awed by the spectacular view below him. He would surely have been captivated by the sheer beauty of the forest in the morning light. His imagination would surely have been stirred by the sights and sounds he would have beheld if he had set foot within its confines.  Its sweet lullaby and wondrous beauty was like a siren call to any traveler but there were those who would hardly be tempted by it.   He had stood since dusk in the middle of the bamboo forest, watching the ascent of the sun up the mountains. He had looked on unflinching and unimpressed as the burst of fire suddenly swept into the forest. The light of sun lit his eyes, fueling the purple flames that were his orbs. He stood as if staring directly at the sun as it straddled the top of the mountains, staring defiantly in the face of the fire god. For how many could look upon the fire god and not be harmed by it?  No one that was except Kenzen.  Having defeated the fire god, he turned his back to it, like a victor turning his back to a shamed and vanquished foe. His expression was impassive as ever in spite of his victory. He had never allowed anyone to look beyond that boyish face.   Ever.  His purpose in the bamboo forest was not done yet though. A more fearsome foe awaited, the only man in the whole world who could strike fear in Kenzen’s heart.   Kenzen’s super keen sense of hearing was strained to the limit as he tried to pick out the direction of his foe’s methodical and confident footfalls. It was a near impossible task and he could swear that the man floated instead of walked. He relished a challenge more than anyone and he had never been bested in combat all this while. His erstwhile opponents had been swept aside with consummate ease and he had not had a serious fight for the longest time.  Such are the hazards of a reputation that preceded him.  Then, out of the blue, as fate would decreed, the gods finally had enough of his supremacy and would conspire to fashion a opponent so awesome that he would strike fear even in the most invincible of beings.  Musa, the True Prince of Camorazzan.  His appearance startled Kenzen. For the first time in his life, he had failed to notice the arrival of his foe. The fact angered more than humiliated him. Still he felt in spite of that he would put things right again, the fear in him be damned. Musa, like all others before him, would be vanquished.  The prince smiled when he saw Kenzen. The latter could not help but cringed at the warmth of the prince’s smile. All his foes came armed with a scowl and with nothing but vengeance on their minds or filled with unadulterated hatred for him. No one but the prince came with the most disarming personality. The sincerity of his smile was like a dagger to Kenzen’s side. Kenzen had never been greeted like that before.  The prince was an anti-thesis of Kenzen. He was all magnetic charm to the latter’s aloofness. He was a picture of confidence and grandeur to Kenzen's well-hidden chasm of self doubts and fears and the latter's friendly disposition was a stark contrast to Kenzen’s morbid pensiveness.  Their differences were even more obvious in their physical appearance. The prince was tall, fair and strong while Kenzen was slight, dark and frail looking. The former looked magnificent in his all-white garb that complemented the splendour of the forest. Kenzen’s all-black attire on the other hand was an eye sore, an abomination amidst the beauty before and around him.   While there was an aura of positive energy emanating from the prince, the very air surrounding Kenzen seemed to wilt before him.  While the prince beamed, the latter scowled.  “I thank you for accepting my invitation to meet me here,” the prince spoke with sincerity, seemingly oblivious to the hostility oozing from the smaller man.  Kenzen almost gulped but checked himself in time. He would not show any weaknesses to his opponent. He had come here expecting a duel of sorts. This was the norm of his life - to fight one battle and one duel after another. He lived to fight and to relish the utter defeat of his foes at his very hands.   All the opponents he had encountered were battle ready and itching to fight him but not the prince though and that very notion scared him more than anything else.  Here in front of him for the second time in his life was a man who had no desire to kill or humiliate him. The first was Charity, but she was a thousand leagues away from here. Kenzen just did not know what to make of the seemingly gentle and unassuming man before him. The prince’s friendliness did more than just put him ill at ease; it made him even more wary of him. He would never have survived this long in the world if he had let his guard down every so often.  Though he had never seen the prince in combat, he already felt part of the battle lost - the contests of wills. This was something he felt that the prince was peerless in. If so, then he would be a formidable opponent indeed. Kenzen had to steel his resolve before all was lost.  “Enough of your niceties,” he retorted, his voice weak compared to the prince’s. “State your business you have with me here and be done with it!”  The prince was momentarily taken aback by Kenzen’s tone as though hurt by the latter’s clear rejection the offer of his confidence. Kenzen smirked, regaining some of his lost confidence at the prince’s wavering demeanour. But to his horror, the prince recovered in no time at all.  “I did come to parley with you, my friend,” said the prince, now sporting a stern countenance. “I merely wanted to establish an understanding with you.”  “I am not your friend and I never make friends with anyone, not even with a prince.”  The prince sighed. It was not a sign of exasperation though. Rather, he was disappointed at Kenzen’s sarcasm. The vibe the latter got from the prince was akin to that of a parent’s disapproval of an errant and willful child’s behaviour. The thought of that maddened him further. The blood rushed to his head.  Draw your damn weapon, prince, and fight me like a man!   “I knew it would be difficult with you but nevertheless I will say what I will have to say then leave, if that is what you desire.”  “Great, I thought you will never start.”  Come on, something’s going make you fight me! Come on, draw your weapon and fight me, dammit! Come on!     The prince continued, unperturbed by the latter’s callousness. “You have a gift, it’s obvious, with the sword. And in your case, that’s two! What you did back there was something never been seen or done before. You fight with more skill than all the weaponmasters of Camorazzan combined. But you fight like an animal, with no quarter or mercy given to anyone. You slaughtered many men out there yesterday. What you did to them was close to despicable.”  “Your point being?”  “You lack direction, a cause,” Kenzen laughed aloud at that but allowed the prince to continued in spite of that. More than he knew it, he was intrigued at what the prince was driving at. “You need a cause to temper your killing rage. You behave as if you have no respect for life whatsoever, your own included.”   “Are you God to tell me how to live my life?”  The price sighed that sigh again. The heat in Kenzen rose up another notch and he had stealthily unbuckled his swords.  One more of that and I will surely kill you!   “That would be too presumptuous of me wouldn’t it? No, what I am to offer to you is something you might worth considering. I offer you a cause worth fighting and living for. Join me, Kenzen. Fight for me!”  “Now that is going way beyond presumptuous, isn’t it? Join your cause? Join you, the enemy of my people and go against my people, my country and my king?”  “I never knew you were such a loyal subject.”   Feleperon  and  Isenejaer  flew out of their scabbards in an instant. Kenzen’s face contorted in rage but somehow he just stood where he was. He was barely in control of himself anymore and he would pounce at any moment.  The prince appeared unfazed by the monstrosity that he had somehow conjured up before him as he went on, “There is that monstrous anger I was talking about! I came here not to pick a fight but to offer an alliance with you. But I guess my friendship is something you have no desire of. But if it’s a fight you want then you shall have it!”  With that, the prince whipped out his awesome saber  Sauraefie .     Finally!  A wicked smile found its way to Kenzen’s face. Though it was a grotesque sight, it had not the desired effect on the prince.   The prince stood face to face with the monster before him, unafraid and as stout-hearted as ever. It seemed like he had a point to prove to Kenzen and he was determined to see through its course.  “Come and face the might of  Sauraefie !”   That was all the invitation Kenzen needed.   To be con’t.

						   8.15 A.M Tuesday Morning....  Waiting for the morning rush hour train as usual.  Almost couldn't get my butt off the bed just now.   Monday Blues had taken a huge toll on me, I almost couldn't survive the onerous boredom and tediousness of work yesterday.     Well, no choice gotta make a living and people are leaching off me as always.     Sigh!   Standing by the platform, I suddenly had a flash of inspiration again.  Instead of standing around in the train and getting shoved around, I should make space for my self to be comfortable.  Yes, my own space!  Of course, I have already thought of the very wonderful  Personal Space Maker , so what I thought of was not a new invention but something that is much more feasible.  Yes folks, a foldable chair. Not the big ones but a mini one that looks like one of those movie directors use.  Heh heh!   Of course, it is not wise to put the chair anywhere on the train, especially in the middle. Those punks will just rush in and topple me over.   Bad Idea, the middle.  So, before the train arrives, I will just shove my way to the front of the crowd who would already be standing inside the yellow box.  You know, I could have sworn the box meant for something for these guys? Like you are supposed to stand behind the yellow lines?   Well, nobody seems to care about that, what more me, the eternal law abiding fool? I've had enough!  I figure that I will probably get a lot of irritated stares by doing that but no one will actually dare voice it out.  Hey, they let the guy in Bishan walk around the station aimlessly, sit on the edge of the platform and then junped into the path of the oncoming MRT.   No one bothered to even report the matter to the station's staff before all that even if they could tell he was a suicide case.  So, in typical Singaporean fashion, we will do what we always do when faced with an out of ordinary situation - use Eye Power.  That's an army term for just staring and not lifting a finger to help when needed or asked to.  Anyway, back to my ingenious plan... The best spot will be at the doors opposite of the the front doors. There, you can get to lean your back against the plastic panel by the side.   It's a good spot also because everyone else will be squeezing to the middle of the train. Can't imagine why when the back is relatively empty before we reach Jurong East Interchange.  Well, everyone's stupidity is my gain. Suckers.  I will probably attract a lot of attention but that's not neccessarily a bad thing.  My fellow commuters may think  that I a looney and keep their distance, thus according me with more space than I would need.  AH AH AH - I am starting to think I am a genius and the rest morons.  AHHHH! I can just imagine the comfort now.  No more getting shoved around, getting told off for trying to protect my hard-earned personal space and getting POKED in the most uncomfortable places by thoughtless and insensitive commuters.   The whole experience will be made perfect with a cup of coffee and this morning's papers.  Hey, I am sure there are no MRT laws against this right? I think I should patent this litle innovative thought also.   Can't afford to have too many competitors, you know.  Ok, dudes, later!
