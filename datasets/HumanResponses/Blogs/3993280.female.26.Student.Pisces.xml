         Sick and tired of LJ not letting me post via clients so I decided to move back to Blogger.  I'm kind of mad that I didn't stay on here from the jump because I was so behind in the whole gmail thing.  I'm just now hearing that some blogger users got to test out gmail first.  That sucks.  Luckily I got my invite awhile ago and have been using gmail anyhow... I'm still waiting on some invites to give out though.  I guess they must be close to making gmail public.      I really don't have much to talk about... OH!  A long time ago I ordered WW At Home and did the three month payment thing.  I only got charged for one month but somehow yesterday I was charged the other two payments.  This was over a year ago when I ordered it!  Isn't that jacked?  I guess I knew it was coming sooner or later but damn.  Could have bought some tires with that money.    Man this month is taking forever to end.  I'm broke as hell and my front tire keeps going flat.  That's a damn shame when you don't even have 30 dollars to get a new tire.  I just got a credit card but since I transferred a balance on to it I only have $1 mf dollar to use.  They called me with some deal (so they say) where I pay double my minimum and my limit increases by 100 dollars.  So I fell for it.  No limit increase yet... I think she said it takes three weeks.  Bleh!  By the time the increase comes I will have my VA check in my hands so I guess it's all for the best... that way I won't have to funk with the CC at all.  Let's hope my tire lasts another two weeks.      I was watching Oprah yesterday when she was talking to Marcus Dixon and that little girl who said he raped her.  What really bothered me about her (the little girl) and I'm sure this bothered people in the audience and viewer's all around... is when she said "My father isn't racist, he has colored friends."  I believe she said colored friends or colored coworkers... something along that line.  If you are using the word "colored" you are racist.  Damn, I didn't even know people still use that word to talk about black folk.  She looked like she was lying anyhow... fake ass tears.      Other than that... I enjoyed Oprah's show.  I don't know if it was a rerun or what but she was talking about O at Home magazine.  It inspired me to clean up my room lol.  It didn't stay neat that long though.  When Chauncey got here it just went to hell again.      We are planning on going to Hartwell after I get paid.  He is going to get me some new tired (woohoo) probably next week and then the week after that I'm taking him to Hartwell to fish and then to eat.  My mom's friend Fukahara-san works as head Sushi Chef at a restaurant (Nami) down by the lake... I'm trying to get some good ass sushi!  I need to inquire about the menu there though because Chauncey doesn't eat Sushi.  He's more of a steak or hamburger man lol.  I know there is an american style restaurant across from it... we'll see!      I was reading this thing on NiaOnline about this girl who asked if she should lose weight for her boyfriend since it bothered him so much.  Obvious answer is hell no... but what caught my attention was the comments from viewers.  This one woman said since they have been dating 5+ years he probably will never marry her anyhow.  Come on, what kind of dumb shit is that?  They are young... both just out of college.  What they are focused on right now is careers and money.  Why get married now?  Just because they dated all through school?  Man please.  I get tired of hearing stuff like that.  Some people date for 10 years and then when they get married shit falls apart.  It doesn't matter how long someone dates... how does that time = "he don't love you anyhow".  Ahh whatever... I don't even know what I'm talking about now... I'm just babbling.  I'm out!
