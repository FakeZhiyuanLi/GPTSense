         Happenstance- This early Audrey Tautou feature is competently made, but entirely unsatisfactory. Think of it as a comedic version of Short Cuts or Magnolia. Now, take away the effortless grace, the interesting characters and insight into the human condition. Happenstance fails because it tries too hard and stretches things to unbelievable extremes. In doing so, it abandons plot, character development and any sense of purpose.  The premise is simple. Any minor event can change the course of history. Following that logic, by taking the time to glance up at Marcello Mastroianni’s dangling cigarette on my “Divorzio All’Italiana” poster, I may cause you to take a chance and try that carpaccio , get food poisoning, lose your job, break up with your girlfriend of 8 ½ years, move out of the country, find a diamond mine in the jungles of Sumatra, return to the Vancouver richer than you ever dreamed, marry the best new actress of the 2009 Wisconsin Film Festival and live a life of luxury. Conversely, by reading this, you may just cause me to drop out of law school, relegate myself to a life of abject poverty and become a gutter crawling heroin addict. If you think those examples are extreme, just wait until you see the movie. The final hour is caused by a man who randomly decides to throw a rotten shoe from a dumpster into the street.  Chance and coincidence are interesting themes. “No End” explored them (as I expect the rest of Kino’s Kieslowski films will). What doesn’t work is utter contrivance at the expense of everything else. I wanted to be charmed. I wanted to chuckle at the film’s cleverness. It didn’t happen. I didn’t care what happened to them because I didn’t know ANYTHING about ANY of them. Even the “I saw it in the stars” lovers fail to exchange a single line of dialogue. They glance at each other, share a birthday and a type of injury, but other than that, there is nothing.  You may want to know if Tautou makes the film worth watching. Not really. She’s absent for about 45 minutes. When she reappears, she does nothing endearing. Apart from a rude scene in the subway, she doesn’t demonstrate any memorable characteristics.  Oh, and the cover is hideous. She never has those awful pig tails or that dreadful shirt. Nor does she look like a 15 year old Lolita. If that wasn’t enough, imdb notes that in Hong Kong, this is known as “Amelie 2”. Why? You’ve got me.  Now, let’s just see how the world changes when I fail to complete thi    The only reason to see it.    Horoscopes, tea leaves, palm readers, love fated by the stars.... important elements of "Happenstance"    The world will never be the same    Another missed opportunity    As was the case with most characters, she had under 5 minutes of screen time    Looking for a better film    Even if I were a bum, I wouldn't trust him to revive me.    Bored yet? I thought so.

      This post is just for Brook. Photography within the exhibit was prohibited, so most of the photos come from the catalog. They are shrunken snap shots, so the quality may be shaky. If you want anything scanned properly, just IM me. I'll take care of it.

         No End- Kielslowski’s 1985 feature reveals a director who is sure of himself. It looks forward to the Three Colors Trilogy. In fact, it blends two plots that would could have fit comfortably in the trilogy. The plot focuses on the wife of a deceased lawyer. Her grieving process is executed similarly to Binoche’s in ‘Blue’. The second storyline involves her husband’s former mentor. He’s nearing retirement, but he agrees to take the husband’s “political case”. Although he doesn’t share the “Red” judge’s habits, Labrador is a similar character.  Kieslowski’s films are difficult to describe and almost as difficult to capture visually. As in his later output, he tackles themes of coincidence, justice in a unbalanced social system, and the impossibility of true independence. He uses the deceased as a sort of narrator. He appears from time to time in the corner of his widow’s eye. He acts as a casual observer, but his presence can be felt. I’ll keep this review short, but if you enjoyed Three Colors, The Decalogue or Double Life of Veronique, you owe it to yourself to look into this one. The widow’s private struggles were more involving than the legal proceedings, but the film is sure to satisfy any Kieslowski fan    Life on hold    Lost but not forgotten    A fatherless child    Guardian Angel    Labrador- A lawyer in his twilight hours    The wife of the striker    Suffering for his cause    One of many Kieslowski-esque details    Another Labrador     It also includes a five minute short film: The Office

         Something Wild- Demme’s romantic comedy may not be high art, but it is an enjoyable ride. The first act is your typical ‘wild girl convinces straight laced business man to have some fun” movie. It’s light weight, fast paced and surprisingly entertaining. Jeff Daniels plays the man. He’s an up and coming vice president. His early naivety reminded of his role in “The Purple Rose of Cairo”. There are also moments that reminded me of the fun that is “Dumb and Dumber”. Melanie Griffith plays Lulu, a Louise Brooks styled party girl. Her performance is the weakest of the three leads, but the character is amusing enough that it hardly matters. After they meet, the next half hour or so are devoted to various crimes and misdemeanors. Almost all of which are entertaining.  The second half of the film takes a decidedly darker tone. This comes courtesy of Ray Liotta. He plays Lulu’s just-out-of-jail flame. Liotta is amusingly over the top. I imagine that it must have been a fun role. Now that I’ve mentioned the setup, I’ll leave it alone. Too much discussion would surely spoil the fun.  A few more notable things: It’s a full of enjoyable cameos. Also, I was confused by the constant African/African American “presence”. None of the leads are black. In fact, none of their friends are either. They don’t speak in slang or anything along those lines, but Griffith’s character is obsessed with tacky African garb. It made her eclectic, but Demme didn’t make the interest very believable. In addition, from time to time, break dancers and singers appear in the background. They are never explained. Simply there. Very peculiar.    Naive but not necessarily dumb    Lulu in Hollywood    Hendry got pinched    Daniels goes undercover, but WHO are those men in the background?    All dolled up    Liotta planning ahead    One of many cameos    Another odd musical interlude    I need one of these

         Sada- Home Vision presents the most recent retelling of the Sada Aba tale. For those who aren’t in the know, she was a prostitute who strangled her lover. Afterwards, she retained a certain organ. There are at least two earlier filmed versions of the story. “In the Realm of the Senses” is the most famous, but it offers nothing more than gratuitous sexuality. “A Woman Called Sada Aba” came next. It tried to humanize the characters. but it is also unremarkable. This 1998 version is the most ambitious of the bunch, but it isn’t without flaws.  The director presumes that viewers know how it is bound to end. In that sense, knowing her crime is like knowing that the Titanic sank. It can’t spoil the film. Since the crime is part of Japan’s popular culture, the film takes a number of stylistic liberties in an attempt to put a fresh spin on things. As we are told, the crime was a small part of Sada’s life. The film spends most of its time covering earlier events. This is quite different than the earlier ‘last few weeks of his life’ films. The film features a narrator who guides us through her life. He’s sort of like a kabuki puppet master or Anton Walbrook in “La Ronde”.  The film also bounces between various combinations of color and black and white. As beautiful as some of the shots are, it feels very random. I was never totally sure of what the switches were supposed to convey. Were they internal/external versions of the events? Recollection vs reality? I doubt anyone could be sure. In addition to these shifts, the film has an odd tone. Most of the first 2/3rds are played light heartedly. This works in some instances, but there is an assault early in the film. It does not work as comedy. It is the worst example of tonal inconsistency, but there are other off putting moments.  Despite the flaws and an over wrought running time, it is more engaging than the earlier productions. The lady who plays Sada has a nice screen presence. Despite the lurid subject matter, it is a constantly tasteful. Nearly everything is implied or stylized to such a degree that even the most vulgar acts turn amusing. It also spends a good deal of time with Sada's obsession with a sickly young student who came to her aid after misfortune struck. Whether that is good or bad will depend on you. I won’t rush back to it, but if I decide to re-watch any of the “trilogy”, this will be the one.  One last thing, there have been concerns about the film’s 4:3 presentation. There are a few shots that look cramped (as I’ll note below), but most everything seems balanced. Of course, you are feel free to judge for yourself. Whatever the situation, it was watchable.    The doomed lovers    Our guide    A tearful farewell    A good samaritan.    Childhood games hint at future means of employment    Sada at work    An example of the awkward comic tone    Stylish, but is it necessary?    This is about as explicit as it gets.    A brief moment of tranquil reflection    This shot is unremarkable, but it suggests that some cropping may be involved. Most of the others seem balanced, so I can't be sure.

         A Real Young Girl- Apparently, Catherine Breillat’s 1976 debut didn’t see the light of day until 2000. If you’re familiar with her work, this probably won’t come as a surprise. Her debut is just as explicit (if not more so) than the highly regarded “Romance”. As you may know, this was my third experience with her. I was sorely disappointed by “Romance” and “Brief Crossing”. This film is unpleasant and frequently a meandering mess, but it was more insightful than the later films.  The lead girl is (supposedly) a 14 year old girl who has returned to her parents’ country home for the Summer. She’s almost entirely unsympathetic. She spends long periods complaining about her oppressions, insecurity and libidinous desires. Her first scene features the line “I hate people.”. Breillat never provides any explanation or logical reason for her to feel this way. To put it briefly, if she hates me; it’s going to take a lot for me to tolerate her.  Since there is no reason to care about the girl’s plight, the film offers nothing but a cavalcade of atrocities. Nearly all are imagined. The girl is too insecure to act on any of them. The low points include a lengthy sexual fantasy which involves her overweight father, a rape scene involving a hunk from father’s wood mill, maggot infested genitalia, etc. etc. Only one scene was worthwhile. It involved co-worker and an alternately seductive and brutal courtship. The rest were empty shockers.  I mentioned that I liked this one a bit more than her other films. For one thing, I liked some of the songs and television performances.  The premise is also fascinating. A coming of age story built on a foundation of unrestrained dreams and traumas could be very interesting. It just didn’t happen this time around.    I hate you too    The oppressors    Dreamy isn't he?    One of the few "appropriate" fantasy shots    If you think this is obvious...    Just look at this one    No longer "young"?    Typical desolation- Note the puppy dog in the right corner    My feelings exactly

         Alias Betty- The international title, “Betty Fisher and Other Stories” is the more appropriate one. The film interweaves the lives of a few strangers in a fairly memorable fashion. First off, we have Betty, a celebrated author and her young son. When her abusive, disconnected mother arrives, her haunted past begins to surface. In many respects, mother is a crueler version of Ingrid Bergman in “Autumn Sonata”. Second, we have a prostitute, her son and her immigrant boyfriend. Throw a few potential fathers/ex-lovers/new flings into the mix, and you’ll have a good idea of what you’re dealing with.  The central event happens very early. Betty’s son is injured. In an attempt to reconcile with her daughter, Betty’s mother brings a new, nearly identical child home one day. I won’t say much more because I would get into spoiler territory, but the film brings up a number of complicated issues: What does it mean to be a parent? Nature vs. nurture, When you can provide a better life, is it morally wrong to keep someone from harm?  As far as my overall reaction goes, it was a thoroughly engaging film. I’m not sure if I would enjoy it as much on a second viewing, but there is a possibility. It’s definitely good enough for a rental.    Betty and mother    Couple 1    Couple 2    Child #1    Child #2    Depression sets in    A capable father figure?    Two schemers with exotic tastes    The film's iconic shot

         Second Skin- This Spanish film tries to remind viewers of Almodovar’s striking interiors. Beneath the glossy veneer, it’s not much better than a Puerto Rican soap opera. Before I get into the negatives, I want to make it clear that Javier Bodem, Cecilia Roth and Ariadna Gil give satisfying performances. The problem isn’t the acting. It’s the script.  It’s a love triangle with a twist. Gil’s husband finds himself in the arms of a local surgeon (Bodem). I imagine that it was an attempt to be shocking, but the events in the film’s final act and the saccharine score are so contrived that the eventual ‘weepy’ ending is almost laughable.  Despite the flimsy plot, it could have been enjoyable if the husband (Molla from “Blow”) had a few redeeming qualities. I don’t know why ANYONE would want to spend time with him. He lies to both parties. He stands them up. He refuses to communicate when the confide in him. In fact, he does nothing positive for anyone else. That leaves us with two characters who mope about and pine for Alberto, but rarely realize that he’s just a waste of time.  I do want to mention that I unknowingly rented the censored R-rated cut. From what I gather, I didn’t miss much. A couple of love scenes were trimmed. They couldn’t have saved the film, so I’m not going to concern myself with it.    Couple 1    Couple 2    Bodem's only true friend    A new hairstyle can't cover up the tears    Bodem- The only interesting character    Trying to be Almodovar?    SO over the top and maudlin- Be aware that this is cross cut with one of her husband's trysts    They all end up like this.

         Bon Voyage- This French entertainment recalls classic Hollywood and two of Clouzot’s peak works. The opening death sequence comes straight out of “Quai des Orfevres”. An old lecher, an old goat if you will, has a rendezvous with Isabelle Adjani. He doesn’t survive. After an accident, the innocent man who came to her aid ends up in prison. Luckily, the Germans take Paris, so he and a new found friend are able to regain their freedom.  From that point (20 minutes or so in) it takes the pace of a screwball rollercoaster. In addition to evading police, finding Adjani, fleeing from the Nazis and looking for love, the characters become involved in a plot that hints at Clouzot’s “Wages of Fear”. It never develops that sort of tension, but that wouldn’t be appropriate.  For the most part, the cast is stellar. I wasn’t familiar with everyone, but Depardieu, Adjani, Attal (My Wife is an Actress) and Ledoyen (8 Femmes) were very enjoyable. The action filled plots were fine, but I ended up more interested in the lead’s (Derangere) romantic issues. Does he keep fighting for his childhood love, the unattainable actress or does he accept the affection of a new found love? Does he focus on writing or French resistance? Is there a balance?  Another interesting theme relates to the role of films in times of trouble. It opens and closes in the cinema. Presumably both scenes take place during Adjani’s fictional “Bon Voyage”. Rappeneau suggests that film may be the only effective means of escape when life appears to be impossible. I tend to agree.    Adjani in her element: the cinema    Depardieu- A powerful political figure    The likable fugitives and a friendly shop girl    Ledoyen lit by sunset    A grim discovery    The tragic accident    Remind you of "Wages of Fear"?

         25 Fireman’s Street- The DVD cover advertises this film as Szabo’s most ambitious. I haven’t seen his entire body of work, but for once I’m inclined to agree with the blurb. Truth be told, ambitious may not translate to “best”, but it is very compelling. I’m still partial to the epic “Sunshine”, but this film is easily my number 2 Hungarian film.  “25” shares certain structural similarities with Bunuel’s ‘Discreet Charm’. Both films are mainly comprised of interlocking dream sequences. This Chinese box format suits both equally well. In the Szabo’s case, the characters reside in a decaying apartment building. The film opens with a shot of its demolition. Such reminders kept me keenly aware that I was watching a doomed population. It also invites allegorical Hungarian nation interpretations.  Without exposition we find ourselves in a surreal world. The images are memorable and often startling. Characters externalize their deepest fears and desires. Considering his working conditions, the visuals are surprisingly dynamic. For the most part, the film has a realistic look. After all, the characters believe that everything that occurs is reality. Odd events frequently disturb this blasé environment. Luckily, they seem purposeful. It isn’t weird for weird’s sake.  The film tackles a number of themes: Post-War/Communist life, fear of impending doom, repressed desires, regret, religion v the state. For the most part, it is effective. There are instances when things get convoluted. I’m pretty sure that a second viewing would clear up some of those sorts of concerns. Since there are numerous inter-related characters and various “narrators” it goes with the territory.  So, now I’ve seen all three of Kino’s new Hungarian releases. If you are to see any of them, this is the one to go with. The DVD is decent and the film appears to be replayable. I hope to rent Szabo’s “Lovefilm” in the near future, so keep an eye out for it.    A bright future    The mirror cracked    Dreams of freedom    Dreams of beauty    Illicit desires    Dreams of affluence (recalling the gift bearing sequence in 8 1/2)    All the pigs. All lined up.    The collapse of bourgeois ideals       Cold War nightmares    Religion in Communist Hungary

         Black Peter (AKA Black Sheep)- Milos Forman’s debut feature examines voyeurism and its role in a young man’s public and private life. Peter is employed as a grocery store security guard/detective. Essentially, he watches for potential wrongdoings. He spends his off time looking at girls. Whether he is at the beach, at a dance or in the city, the results are the same. He is unable to do anything other than look.  Forman suggests that “action” is the primary means of becoming a man. Peter’s family taunts him when he fails romantically. He is negatively compared to a bricklayer’s apprentice (the working man). Forman uses a series of pairings to create a fairly impressive debut. It looks ahead to his later Czech work. This film, “Loves of a Blonde” and “The Fireman’s Ball” all feature central dance hall sequences. It is a step below many of the celebrated new wave films (Closely Watched Trains and The Shop on Main Street), but interesting enough if you enjoy his Hollywood work. As you can see, the Facets DVD is mediocre. The subs are burned in and blurring is frequent. Still, as a rental it is passable considering the fact that it is the only easy means of seeing the film.    A passive black sheep    Gainfully employed    Leisure    Frustrated father    An impatient mother    The "superior" working man    Peter's love interest    The dance hall    The sacred    and the profane

         French Cancan- I’m glad that I decided to give this film a second chance on DVD. When I first saw it, I wrote it off as a frivolous, moderately interesting musical comedy. On second viewing, it’s charms really hit home. I think it’s because I watched it differently. The first time through, I focused on Jean Gabin and the opening of the Moulin Rouge. This time, I concentrated on Nini, the laundry girl. She is a clear influence on Kidman’s Satine. When examined from that angle, it makes for an enchanting experience. She balances four loves: one rich, one poor, one a showman and finally, the joy of performance itself. When coupled with Renoir’s remarkable eye for composition and the reasonably vibrant transfer, you have a winner. This particular picture will be better explained pictorially, so I’ll leave you with a few choice shots.    Gabin and Nini    The Moulin Rouge!    Stars in her eyes    Lover 1: the baker    Lover 2: the Count    I have a nearly identical picture by Barbier in my study    Gabin's old flame    One of the children of paradise    Could Baz have been inspired by this sequence?

         General Idi Amin Dada (Self Portrait)- Barbet Schroeder’s documentary preserves Idi Amin’s idiotic ramblings for future generations. If he hadn’t feared for his life, I imagine that Schroeder wouldn’t have been able to contain his laughter whenever Amin spoke. I’ve never seen such a misguided ego maniac. He sees himself as an African savior. He discusses his admiration for Hitler, the role of women, his ability to forecast the future and his uncanny ability to control the animals of savannahs. In addition, he demonstrates an invasion of Israel and plays the accordion.  I’m not sure how viewers would take the film when it was initially released. Amin was certainly more menacing while he remained in power. Looking at it nearly 30 years after release, it is more comical than menacing. Although Amin supported it (and apparently believed in all that he said), Schroeder is sure to provide some commentary to offset the grandiose claims. It’s one of those films that must be experienced to be believed. It’s a rather straightforward documentary, but I sat in shock whenever Amin spoke. His views are beyond belief. I’m not sure if it would hold up to repeat viewing, but it is certainly worth a rental.    Idi Amin demonstrates his power over an elephant    Truer words have never been spoken    An informed view    Life under Amin    Did I mention that he provided the score?    It's a real shame. They could have been HUGE!    Another liberal declaration    One of many staged gatherings

         Adoption- This is the second of Kino’s Hungarian releases. It was more straight forward than the Szabo film. It’s shot in a near verite style. There are a few flourishes, but it is largely documentary style in nature. Again, the transfer suffers, but as far as I know, this is the only easily accessible version of the film, so we’re stuck with it.  It is the story of a middle aged lady who wants a child. She’s a working class widow, but she believes that she can handle a child with or without the support of her long time lover. Given the title, I expected that she would have a few struggles getting pregnant before choosing to adopt. In fact, for the most part, the title isn’t so literal. It refers to the budding relationship between the hopefully expectant mother and a local girl who is in the care of the state. This mother/daughter relationship is the core of the film. The hope for a “real” child are always in the background, but 75% of the film stays with one of the two leads. In fact, the child on the cover is only on screen for about 1 minute.  As far as my reaction goes, I liked it, but it isn’t something that I would be compelled to see a second time. That is in part due to the transfer, but also because I didn’t find the characters to be compelling enough to revisit. That’s not to say that they were shallow or poorly acted, they just didn’t click with my sensibilities. Regardless, if you’re a fan of Eastern European cinema, it’s a solid choice. It doesn’t really lend itself to screen captures, so that will explain the relatively slim amount.

         Father- This is an early film from Szabo, the director of Mephisto and Sunshine. The influence of the new wave French and Czech directors is clearly evident. French in the vivacious fantasy sequences and semi documentary feel. Czech in the ways that it deals with Communist rule and coming of age.  As the title indicates, this is the story of a boy who lost his father in the second world war. How does he come to terms with the loss? That varies. The film is split into two nearly equal halves. At first, we spend time with a young boy whose memory of his father is comprised with elaborate fantasy sequences. He was a doctor and a member of the party. That, we know for sure. The protagonist imagines his father in great rallies, risky motorcycle chases and an assortment of other activities. Some may not like the way that Szabo cuts between the grim realities of communist Hungary and the over the top childhood fantasies, but I found it refreshing. I was surprised that the film still felt lively. After all, films like “Mephisto” and “Taking Sides” are rather subdued.  The second half of the film involves the son as a young man. He begins to realize that he’s lost sight of who his father really was. He undertakes to unravel the past. It is vaguely similar to “Citizen Kane’s” interview/searching process, but only superficially. It’s closer to the feel of “Big Fish”. I can’t quite put it in words, but their plots are both similar and entirely opposite. In one, the father has created a life of tall tales. The son must figure out who his father really was. In “Father”, the boy created the myth and he must unravel it.  In addition to the search, the second half sees the son begin a life apart from his family. This is where the coming of age elements are strongest. The first half touches on some school yard antics, but the boy’s external life doesn’t take the forefront until the second act.  So, how about a recommendation? I happened to consider this film a wonderful surprise. If you like what you’ve seen of Criterion’s Czech films, you’ll certainly find something to enjoy. There is a downside. The picture quality is shaky at best. I noticed what I believe is called “ghosting” on numerous occasions. The screenshots don’t really illustrate this, but they should give you an idea of what you’re getting into. Still, I heartily recommend a rental.  FYI: I planned to take a look at another Szabo Kino release today, but my rented copy of 25 Fireman’s St arrived in about 25 pieces. I should have a replacement by the end of the week.    The son's reality    The son    The father    Grim reality    Idealistic fantasy    All grown up?    Mother and son    The girl of his dreams?    Lost souls

         Ripley’s Game- John Malkovich provides an interesting take on the Ripley character, but he finds himself in the least satisfying of films in the series. I didn’t realize it when I rented it, but this is the same story as Wim Wenders’ “American Friend”. Ripley is involved, but in many senses he is a secondary figure. Most everything centers around the dealings with frame maker. He was adequate, but Bruno Ganz take on the character was more memorable. Basically, he’s suffering from a life threatening illness. In order to earn money for his family, he stumbles into a job as a hit man. Ripley and an English boor pull the strings. The tense scenes are adequate, but they lack the sense of urgency that is present in the Wenders version. In that film, the character’s desperation is clearly evident. Here, apart from one medical visit, there is no reason to believe that he is really ill.  The same goes from Ripley’s role as an art dealer. That was prevalent in the older film. Here, it opens the film, but is quickly forgotten. As I mentioned, Malkovich is a good choice for his character, but he doesn’t have enough to work with. Basically, he’s just John Malkovich. He has a few lines about his life in a moral vacuum, but nothing remarkable.  Also, the characters’ wives were bland. In fact, for a scene or two I thought that they were the same woman. They did nothing to leave a lasting impression. This was a disappointment because I enjoyed the tension between Ganz and his wife in the earlier film.  As far as the look and direction go, again, it is merely adequate. There are some nice European locals, but nothing stunning. Cavani doesn’t have a distinctive style. It’s similar with numerous other non-auteur Europeans.  All in all, it’s worth a rental if you like the character of the cast, but don’t expect the beauty of the Matt Damon film, the charm of Alain Delon or the emotional depth of the Wenders versions.    Always on the outside   Scott is tempted by a tasteless Brit    Music and fashion- crucial to Malkovich's wife    Scott's motivation    An attractive chateau, but not as glorious as Matt Damon's world    Just another casual listener    Ripley's prize possessions       Ripley appreciates beauty    A man with a delicate tastes

         Bubba Ho-Tep- I have mixed feelings about this one. To keep things simple, I’ll start with bullet points of the positives and negatives POSITIVES Bruce Campbell IS his character I adore ancient Egypt The concept is entirely unique (at least as far as I can tell) The filmmakers knew how to stretch their budget The action scenes are chuckle-worthy The themes (aging/regret, the fate of icons that are past their prime) are interesting There is an interesting flashback/hallucination  NEGATIVES The constant bodily humor (especially having it so central to the plot) grew tiresome The peripheral characters were forgettable The dyed JFK character wasn’t quite as believable as Campbell The actions scenes aren’t what I would consider repeatable.  So, it looks like the positives outweigh the negatives. As I mentioned above, the premise (JFK and Elvis in a haunted rest home) is very unique. It doesn’t have the frenzied pace of an “Evil Dead”, but it gains some poignancy because of the lead performance and the sad state of affairs at the Texas retirement home. Be aware that if you aren’t familiar with Campbell’s older, similarly quirky work, you may come away bewildered and disappointed. I’m not one to swoon over these sorts of films, so a suggestion of ‘give it a chance if it sounds at all alluring’ is a strong one. Of course, if the premise appears to be too much for you, go ahead and skip it. You won’t like it anyway.  I struggled to decide if I should include a shot of the creature. I ended up doing it because 1- It is revealed in the trailer. 2- I wanted to remember the look.    Fit Elvis    Our able bodied heroes- Elvis and the dyed JFK    A recollection of past glories    Bubba Ho-Tep himself    Who wouldn't want to spend her golden years here?    A slew of minor characters help to create a depressing atmosphere    She's a non-important character, but I've had requests for photos of "hot" women, so I do my best to present the best that each film has to offer. In this instance, I believe she was the only woman under a half century in age, so my choices were limited.    Anubis- He used to be my favorite Egyptian God. I still have the statue and papyrus depictions, so I guess I was a bit obsessed.

         Sweet Sixteen- This was my first experience with Ken Loach’s films. I’ve been searching for “Kes” for some time now, but to no avail. This film is the tale of a troubled fifteen year old. His mother is in prison. Apart from crime, he appears to have no future prospects. All of the characters batter one another with endless streams of verbal and physical abuse. Few actions are motivated by bravery or goals. Most are simply apathetic.  Liam is the exception. He wants to create a life for his mother. The trouble is, he’s severely misguided. His schemes lead from one dead end to the next. In a sense, he’s a modern (and doubly troubled) Antoine Doniel. The characters are generally despicable, but they are very believable. Just because I don’t care to come within 1000 miles of them doesn’t mean that they can’t create an interesting film. In some cases, it reminded me of Lynn Ramsey’s “Ratcatcher”. Visually, that film is more interesting and it is less crime-centric, but the atmospheres are similar.  Please be advised that subtitles are a must for your first viewing. It is technically English, but only as understandable as Brad Pitt’s “Snatch” character. Also, be aware that it is filled with filthy language. Normally, that isn’t an issue, but these characters use a number of vulgarities that are rarely heard in American films (at least at such frequency). If those two points don’t bother you, “Sweet Sixteen” offers a glimpse at a fascinatingly seedy culture of nihilism and brutality.    Liam sports a rare smile    The studious one    Mommy dearest    Here's my secret. I'm a girl who likes her fun. And if you can keep it, then you just might be the one.    The garden of Earthy delights     And when I overtake, I'm going to be in pole position (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah)    One of the few moments of hope    An every day happening    The 400 Blows?

         Le Divorce- This uneven film isn’t light enough to succeed as a romantic comedy, but it is too shallow to sit alongside the best of the Merchant Ivory oeuvre. Naomi Watts is a poetess in the midst of a divorce. While staying with her in Paris, he sister, Kate Hudson, spends a bit of time comforting Watts, but a great deal of time amusing herself with a pair of Parisian lovers. If it stuck to those two plots and kept things bubbly, it could have been a success. After all, culture clash films can be amusing. On top of that, it’s full of gorgeous dinners, fabulous dresses, a highly cultured little girl and a Leslie Caron cameo.  Sadly, the movie loses its way when it throws in a tedious plot that involves the differences between the French and American legal systems and the sale of a painting. It was of slight interest to me because I could follow the discussions, but it had no place in the film. For most viewers, I imagine that such scenes would be dreadfully boring. There is also a dull plot with a stalker. He’s the American husband of Watts’ husband’s Russian lover. For some reason he seems to assume that stalking the sisters will lead to some sort of reconciliation with his wife. Again, this detracts from the only interesting story lines: those of the sisters and their romances.  I can’t recommend this movie very highly. I’m sure that some viewers will be attracted by the Merchant Ivory name or the leading ladies. It isn’t a complete waste of time, just a wasted opportunity. Oh yes, as you will see in the shots, Hudson’s “Paris hair” is an absolutely atrocious wig. In film that spends so much time flaunting haute culture, you would think that they could have made her look like less of a hag.    "A lovely view."    Pre-Paris hair Hudson dons an umbrella worthy of Jacques Demy    Sugar daddy, married man, uncle in law and provider of Grace Kelly purses    Hudson's JV lover    "Thank Heaven for Little Girls"    The cause of all of their legal woes    How I miss French cusine    As you can see, Watts' daughter has impeccible taste. Not only does she enjoy Moria Shearer in "The Red Shoes", she watched "La Belle et la Bete" with her mother.    Note the horrid wig. An improvement over the cover photo? I think not.    The world's most boring stalker    The film's most important lesson. Although you CAN'T drink most alcohol while pregant, you may make an exception when it comes to porto. I told you this movie had a few redeeming features!

         Goodbye Lenin!- The trailers presented this as a light comedy with a few serious undertones. Luckily, it was light on comedy and full of poignant “end of an era” sorts of images. The conceit is a simple one. A socialist advocate falls into a coma. During her hospital stay, the wall comes down and the West takes hold in East Berlin. When she comes to, her son does everything in his power to keep the truth from her. Why? He believes that such a shock would be her end. I have the same problems with the premise as I did with “My Life Without Me”. It forces us to sympathize with characters who may have great intentions, but who are ultimately liars. It’s one thing to keep up a façade to shelter your loved ones, but when it reaches the strain of “Lenin” it is completely unfair to keep the truth from them.  Despite that underlying problem, it was quite enjoyable. It does a good job of presenting what I assume is an accurate portrait of liberated East Germany. We see the lure of commercialism. We see its successes and ultimate failures. It also balances just the right amount of comedy with the more serious familial illness/birth of a nation themes. In addition, the son and his girlfriend (mother’s nurse) worked surprisingly well together. Some may decry it for its simplicity, but it knows what it is setting out to accomplish and it achieves admirably. After all, all good allegories are simple on their face.    In one of a few 2001 references, the son takes on the role of the ape.    Mother's world    The collapse of the Communist state?    Lara is a life saver for mother and son    A fragile awakening    A questionable prognosis    An example of Becker's eye for details.

         Malibu’s Most Wanted- It’s sad to say, but it just wasn’t bad enough. It’s a one joke movie, but it isn’t inept enough to be enjoyable. It’s as competent as your average sitcom. By that, I mean that the direction was boring, the jokes were tame and if I didn’t write this review immediately after watching it, it would be forgotten. In case I needed a refresher, I now know why I avoid television.  The plot is by the numbers. A powerful father figure never gave his son the time of day. Now, he’s a wanna-be rapper. That joke was tired before “Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)” came out. In fact, it would be better suited for the length of an extended music video. Everything that needs to be shown could appear in 10-15 minutes. In fact, the first 5 or 10 minutes of setup were so ridiculous that my hopes were raised. Once the plot kicked in, it went on auto-pilot. It’s another instance of intentional comedy that elicits no laughter. If they had played it as a serious drama (like “You Got Served”) then it may have been amusing for half an hour instead of about 12 minutes.  The pictures begin with the main characters. The last few are minor moments, but they illustrate the rare moments of complete foolishness that the picture desperately needed.    B-Rad and crew    Black actors turned "thug" for love of money.    The love interest    An old boo    B-Rad's picture perfect family    White Kong    Snoop Dogg appears in the guise of a sagely rodent    High comedy    La Dolce Vita    Parents just don't understand    The captions speak for themselves

         Lagaan (Once Upon a Time in India)- This is just about the best that Bollywood has to offer. It is long (3+ hours), easily predictable and full of thinly developed stereotypes, but it was entertaining enough to view once. The plot is simple enough. Our heroes are starving farmers. The British men are pure evil. Apart from the helpful Elizabeth, they have no redeeming qualities. Despite the fact that it hasn’t rained in months, a governor levels a double Lagaan (tax) against the peasants. When they protest, he challenges them to a game of cricket. Win and they don’t pay for 3 years. Lose and they pay triple. As far as the title goes, I guess they felt that it would be easier to sell it's exoticism with the original title. No one I know would watch a four hour Indian movie about cricket if it were called "Tax".  You can imagine where it goes. It’s full of songs and spectacle. The final game goes on for well over an hour. I don’t understand cricket. The movie explained it to some degree, but I was never quite sure how runs were scored or how the bowling worked. Regardless, the plot is easy enough to follow.  I’ve seen a few other Bollywood films and this was by far, the most professional. They acting is competent. The songs are catchy and more restrained than cheaper productions. There were enough conflicts to fill a soap opera. They were almost always cliché, but that goes with the territory. As far as a recommendation goes, if you’re going to give modern Indian films a chance, this is a good place to start. Just know what you’re getting yourself into. Maybe you’ll be entertained too.    Imperialism and power: what it's all about    Our courageous, nature-loving, Valentino    The bad, bad, bad, white men. I don't believe he ever stopped squinting and scowling    Waiting to be wooed    The most refined ladybugs do it when a gentleman calls.    The only hope    A Victorian gentleman    When a game is not just a game    Can you hear me?    In shallow shoals, Engligh soles do it!    Let's misbehave!

         The Great Escape- Once again, I have been spoiled by the French. “Le Trou”, “A Man Escaped” and “Grand Illusion” are vastly superior prison films. Surprisingly, all three were made prior to the McQueen film. That means that age alone is not responsible for the flaws. It is overly sanitized, incredibly lengthy and not as “entertaining” as most of the raves led me to believe. Of course, on closer investigation many of its accolades were penned by men who like men’s movies.  If you like your films full of brave men, patriotism and impossible odds, “The Great Escape” may thrill you. I grew tired of the unnecessary comedy. It took away any suspense that might have surfaced. This was based on a true story, but I have trouble believing that Nazis would be so lenient. How many times did McQueen attempt to escape? 25? 35? They should have left him in a ditch with a bullet in his brain. That’s not to say that I didn’t like him. In fact, the movie did redeem itself after the big break. The non-prison scenes were vastly superior to everything in the first two hours. That’s because the tone fit a chase-filled action movie. If the prison scenes had been tense and the tone shifted after the escape, it would have been a satisfying experience. Sadly, it was two hours of boredom followed by a few fun motorcycle moments.  One review mentioned that when he saw the film, he was completely taken by the way that it presented a “rebel” in a heroic light. Forty years later, that technique is unremarkable. It borders on cliché. Sure, the baseball tossing, cooler than cool McQueen is still captivating, but his character doesn’t have the allure that he once did.  Getting back to the French movies… The first two work because of their minimalism. One involves a group of men who are tunneling (also a true story). The second has a solitary main character. They have moments of reprise, but they never sacrifice the tension for a cheap laugh. That makes them tense, nearly white knuckle experiences. Without that involvement, “The Great Escape” dragged on and on. It tried for the class conflicts and interactions of “Grand Illusion”, but there were too many characters and their relations were stretched too thin.  So, in short, I was disappointed. If you like your Hollywood heroics, you’ll probably prefer “The Great Escape” to the other films that I mentioned, but if you do enjoy it, by all means, give the others a chance.  FYI: The screen captures are from the old edition. It looks terrible, but I’m sure that they still give you an idea of the film’s feel. I'm also not sure why it looks so squeezed. It was only like that on my PC. I didn't feel like getting to the bottom of the problem. My apologies.    The Cooler King's two favorite pastimes    The director did take advantage of the wide frame. You have to give him that.    Dreaming about the open range    Our Man Flint    Fearless leader    Indiana Jones couldn't do it better.

         Elena and her Men- Renoir’s film presents Ingird Bergman at her most stunning. She plays a penniless princess who has the uncanny ability to woo both rich and poor. She makes the film worth watching. If it weren’t for her gorgeous costumes and Renoir’s careful camera work, I’m afraid that the film would be a rather forgettable (albeit confusing) melodrama.  I can’t be sure if it was the distraction of old Quebec or if the plot just was not engaging, but I watched it in a few pieces. That didn’t help to clarify the dull politicking or add humor to the slapstick scenes. Quite frankly, I never really cared what was happening to the men. The was a hopeless romantic who pined for Bergman. There was a general (Jean Marias) who was involved in some sort of dictatorship scheme. There were also a number of high society scenes. They seemed to lampoon the idle classes, but only slightly. In fact, they were something like lo-carb “Rules of the Game” leftovers. Not quite funny enough. Not quite deep enough. Not entertaining. This IS meant to be an amusing film, so the flimsiness is detrimental.  That being said, it does have its moments. Bergman is always charming. She’s especially bubbly in this role. The parade/carnival/any scenes with crowds are impressively staged. The musical framing (one lady singing between crucial scenes) worked well. Still, it is a let down. I was hoping that this could be the “gem” that would entice me to make the Renoir boxset my own. Maybe it’s for the best, but that money will go toward something more satisfying: truffles.  I hope that I didn’t get too carried away with the pictures. I had lots of time with the DVD, so I may have been a bit excessive.     Elena and henry: Her forgotten man    Joie de vivre    That beastly general    An officious intermeddler    Could Renoir be dreaming about Verdi?    My favorite shot    Splendor abounds, but it feels a bit hollow    Worthy of framing? Maybe, but it is much too artificial for my taste.    A comic scene that just didn't work    The Dueling Cavalier is now a musical.    This chirping chickadee...    will make you want to press "stop".    Yes. She's pretty.

        The Golden Coach- Jean Renoir’s 1954 film owes more to Italian theatrical and operatic traditions than concerns of Parisian society that permeate his pre-war work. In the introduction, Martin Scorsese mentions that this was the first Italian Technicolor production. The ultimate result is a playful, garishly painted, period comedy. It is both frivolous and riddled with meaning.  On the surface, Anna Magnani’s amorous escapades are the thing that clichés are made of. A bawdy Italian actress wows a set of men: the powerful viceroy, the lusty bullfighter and a disenchanted, yet idealistic soldier. Luckily, Renoir subtly blends the age old themes of “the role of artist” and the class conflicts that made his Bodou Saved from Drowning, Rules of the Game and Grand Illusion so memorable.  Despite the serious themes, the Golden Coach is more concerned with aesthetics than anything else. Renoir takes full advantage of his newly acquired palate. Harlequin romances and society balls provide a few highlights. Costuming, décor and framing are the top priority. The fate of the viceroy’s golden coach is frequently secondary.  Please be aware that it is not without flaws. It is necessarily stagey. The un-sophisticated new world setting (a Latin American colony) was also tiresome. Anna Magnani’s performance is the only one that doesn’t feel forced. This may be a part of the commedia dell’arte tradition, but I found it distracting. Additionally, the last scene or two suffer from a significant decline in video quality. The jury is still out as far as that is concerned. Poor source material or faulty mastering?  As a whole, I enjoyed the film. It isn’t going to convert you to a Renoir fan if you already dislike him. As a matter of fact, I advise watching his 30s masterpieces before considering the new boxset. I have yet to watch/re-watch the other two films, but based on my reaction to “French Cancan” on VHS, I prefer Renoir’s earlier works to his light comedies.    Magnani on stage with her famous harlequin dress    Renoir's comic fantasies    The suitors: bullfighter, viceroy, new world soldier/explorer    Magnani's gracious audience    The ruling class    Trapped by society    An example of the poor clarity of the final reel

      Dear loyal readers,  It is with a heavy heart that I announce a temporary hiatus. I leave for Montreal in less than twelve hours. If all goes as planned, I will have internet access, but I will not be watching (m)any films. If you're lucky, I'll post my reviews of "The Golden Coach", "Elena and her Men", "A Woman is a Woman", "The Great Escape" and "Lagaan" over the next few days. "French Cancan", Three of Kino's Hungarian films, Ozon's "See the Sea" and "General Idi Amin Dada" will be reviewed sometime after the sixteenth. They're in the mail, but unreceived.  If you are truly blessed, I may post some photos of my charming escapades.    I will be here.    and I may be here    but don't be afraid    don't get bored,    have a drink or two,    and get some rest.    I'll see you soon!

         Secret Ballot- Iranian films are known for spectacular images and languorous pacing. Much to my chagrin, “Secret Ballot” stretched a handful of beautiful shots and a thin concept to mind numbing extremes.  It is election day in a middle eastern country. I can only presume that it is Iran. When a female election official arrives on a remote island, a soldier is assigned to protect her. They spend the day attempting to convince locals to vote. The interactions are episodic and subtly humorous. The characters are frequently indifferent to the election. I can’t decide if the film is meant to criticize the inefficiency of bureaucracy, illustrate the meaninglessness of democracy or present a newly liberal, forward looking Iran. I wouldn’t be surprised if it is a blend of all three.  The film certainly presents some interesting concepts. Most interesting is the presence of a female government official. The problem is, it stretches itself too thin. I expected a meditative pace, but it is difficult to justify the number of lengthy static shots with characters performing mundane actions. Sure, we need time to contemplate what we’re seeing, but after a while, the tedium becomes almost intolerable. I believe that it could have been more effective if 15-20 minutes were trimmed from the running time. Believe me, every interaction could still fit in.  As far as the visuals go, it has its fair share of attractive shots, but it didn’t capture the poetry of Baran (my favorite Iranian movie). You can expect a review of that title at some point down the line.  In conclusion, this film will probably only appeal to those of you who are already accustomed to Iranian cinema. I won’t dissuade you from giving it a chance, but if you’re looking to expand your horizons, I would suggest starting with “Children of Heaven” or “Baran”.     The island    The election official    The escort    A soldier's life    The film's crucial elements.    I was hoping for more of this.    Abiding by laws can be futile.

         Mississippi Masala- Mira Nair’s second theatrical release tells a familiar tale of racial tensions, but the angle is unexpected and rarely addressed in American cinema. When Idi Amin took power in Uganda, he expelled foreigners. Nair focuses on an Indian lawyer’s family. They resettle in a small town in the deep south. When the daughter falls for a young black entrepreneur (Denzel Washington), her family’s prejudices reveal themselves. Nair effectively demonstrates the fact that racial tensions are not strictly black and white.  The film hints at the viewer friendly approach of “Monsoon Wedding”. It lacks the harsh realism of “Salaam Bombay!”, but with the help of a memorable performance from Denzel Washington, it introduced Nair to a mainstream audience. The story may be predictable, but the unique perspective and Nair's ability to balance three distinct cultures make it satisfying. If anything, it will give me the motivation to see "General Idi Amin Dada".    Idi Amin's Uganda    A forgotten comrade    Denzel: the carpet cleaner    Meena's culture    The lovers meet in the bayou.    Meena's family    employment    A stylish flourish

         The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra- If you spent any portion of your formative years with movies like “The Blob”, “The Day the Earth Stood Still” or any lesser known sci-fi schlock, “Lost Skeleton” is a must see. If you’re anything like me, you’ll smile and giggle at most every reminder of your youth. Although the filmmakers could be faulted for trying too hard to be clever, I don’t think that they could have done things differently. If the dialogue wasn’t filled overstatements, naivety, and incurable double negatives it wouldn’t be parody. It would just be a bad movie. Fortunately, for the most part, it captures the essence of the movies that it lampoons. It isn't the perfect satire that some suggested, but it has a certain amateur charm.  The plot involves a scientist of questionable credentials, his bubbly wife, a pair of space aliens, and a maniacal villain. They are all after a mysterious radioactive substance. Where do the skeleton, the mutant and Animalia fit in? That’s for you to discover. Don’t worry, I don’t plan on revealing the look of the massacring mutant.  As far as recommendations go, you really have to be familiar with the genre.  If that is the case, by all means, give it a rental. You don’t have to “like” the genre. I spend most of my time attempting to AVOID sci-fi films, but I was amused for the duration.    Dr. Paul Armstrong and Betty- A scientist and his kitty    The meteor lights up the night sky.

         Zorba the Greek- Apart from seeing a few photos of Zorba, I knew almost nothing about this movie before I watched it. I’m pleased to say that it holds up surprisingly well. I assume that it was shot on location in Greece. Some of the landscapes were fantastic! The plot synopsis is fairly easy to recite. An American author travels to Crete after he inherits some land. He meets Anthony Quinn; one of the liveliest characters that I’ve seen in some time. He’s practically effervescent. I enjoy Quinn in “La Strada”, but I haven’t seen much of his Hollywood work. I’ve never been fond of military films. This role really illustrates his magnetic screen persona.  Apart from Quinn’s performance, I was really taken by how hard edged some of the events were. There was one moment in particular that shocked me. I expected some last minute intervention, but it just didn’t work out that way. That scene and one other really turned me against the locals. Apart from the main characters (the two men and two women), most everyone else is part of a nameless working class mob. I was indifferent to them for most of the running time, but after a scene when they stripped every possession from the residence of wealthy woman as she lay on her death bed, I was practically livid. Their excuse: The estate would have escheated to the state. They were “the poor”, so they deserved to supercede the law. Completely despicable!  As far as the look goes, the shots will illustrate just how close it is to neo-realism. There are some Hollywood flourishes, but considering the age of the picture, it was gritty.    Zorba and Basil share a meal    Signs of Spring    The domicile    Zorba and his petite tra la la.    The umbrellas of Crete    How much is that widow in the window?

         Musa the Warrior- If you think “Braveheart” and countless other macho macho man movies are the bee’s knees, you’ll adore this epic Korean film. It has realistic battles, a treacherous journey, class-indifferent love and plenty of sacrifice. Those elements are just as well executed as a high profile Hollywood production. The DVD even has a DTS track.  What about those of us who merely tolerate such tales of undying heroism? It’s still just as worthy of a viewing as any US production. Just heed a few warnings. By her usually standards, Zhang Ziyi’s princess is incredibly passive. Her boredom is nearly as obvious as the desert’s sweltering heat. Apart from her, the rest of the cast is male. A few of them are memorable. There are two rivals generals. The central character is brash former slave. He’s frequently impulsive. Normally, such actions would be justified by l'amour fou, but he has not relationship to speak of with Ziyi. There are other characters, but I can’t remember them. Most perform one or two action to push the plot along. After that, they are dust in the wind.  The film is fairly attractive. The haze of the desert gets tiresome by the end, but that’s a minor point. The battles are surprisingly realistic. I guess I’m just partial to stylized wire work.  In conclusion, Musa will appeal to most every fan of the genre. It offered enough to amuse me. I’m not sure if my complaints are really film specific or directed at the whole “epic hero” genre.    The vast Chinese deserts.    Princess Zhang Ziyi    The Korean general- one of the good guys    The evil general- Han or Mongul. I've forgotten.    He's a slave 4 her.    A woodland battle. Who died? I can't remember, but he wasn't nice.    The spoils of war.    An example of the sweltering cinematography.    A citadel fit for a standoff.

         Time Out- Vincent could be Tom Ripley’s cousin. Both of their lives are artificial constructions. The similarities end there. Ripley is a Machiavellian opportunist. He slithered into the Garden of Eden. Vincent had what he wanted. The job. The family. The money. When his lifestyle is threatened, he reveals himself as a coward. He pretends that nothing has changed. He isn’t a bad man. He’s merely misguided and insecure. Such a scenario could have easily worked as black comedy, but the filmmakers opted for a serious tone.  The film plays out slowly. This allows us to adjust to Vincent’s pitiful life. It doesn’t lend itself to screen captures. There are few characters. Most scenes take place in offices, cars and private residences. The film’s haunting qualities are only evident if you see if for yourself. It won’t be for all tastes. In fact, it’s the type of film that seems better suited for discussion and reflection than actual viewing. Regardless, it is an impressive study of lingering desperation.  The US trailer is interesting to compare with the film. It presents Vincent as a man who acted out of compassion for his family. He does care about them, but I have a feeling that was simply too passive to follow any other path.    Who's got the looks? Who's got the brains? Who's got everything?    I click my heels and I'm there.    Now there's a place to go.    On the outside    A day at the office    I thought I'd lost you.

         My Wife is an Actress- Yvan Ittal and Charlotte Gainsbourgh are married. In fact, they play themselves in this film. One has to wonder what is fact and what is fiction. She’s a famous actress. He plays a sports writer. When she accepts a starring role in a British film with Terrence Stamp (as John), jealousy and suspicion threaten to undermine their relationship.  Ittal’s film isn’t exceptional, but it is very enjoyable. It follows a predictable romantic comedy plot, but the characters are charming enough to keep things interesting. They deal with issues such as her celebrity status, film as reality, possessiveness and the issues that his Jewish background bring to the foreground. This is handled with wit and charm. That’s not to mention a pleasant soundtrack that consists of flapper-era show tunes, French pop and The Clash’s “London Calling”. All in all, the next time you want to watch a light, bubbly romance, you could do a lot worse than “Ma Femme est une Actrice”.    I loved the title sequence. Classic actresses over a catchy tune    Charlotte in an interview    Yvan watches Charlotte    The charming limey    Ludivine Sagnier- an aspiring theatre actress    Yvan tries his hand at his wife's craft.    Suspicion: Fact or Fiction?    Yvan's stress becomes unbearable.    "London Calling"    A charming suitor

         Jubilee- Jarmon’s best known film is unique. You have to give it that. Who else would dare to throw Queen Elizabeth and the mercurial Ariel into an apocalyptic wasteland that is populated almost exclusively by androgynous new wave gangs? As you can imagine, the plot doesn’t make sense. As a matter of fact, I don’t think that anything was accomplished by the end. The Faerie Queene glimpsed into the future and came to the conclusion that her beloved Albion was headed into the abyss.  The film itself is as awkward as the concept. It’s supposed to take place in the future, but it looks like a dirtier, acid infused version of the 70s. The characters ramble on about vapid political theories and baseless metaphysics. Then they get high and find an orgy. There are all sorts of bizarre religious references. An annoying over-actor oversees the world because he controls the world’s largest recording studio. The characters take part in various revolutionary acts. Against who and for what purpose? You’re asking the wrong person.  That being said, although it is overly long and dramatically flat, it’s an interesting piece of pop culture. I don’t imagine anything similar being made, so if you have to see the most obtuse films, it’s worth a shot. If you like what you see in the pictures, you might enjoy the film. That’s not a promise, so I’d advise a rental. If the pictures horrify you, skip it.    The future belongs to the blank generation.    Note the not-so-subtle classification of the world and the gentleman who is about to steal a pair of sunglasses from the poor Bug driver.    A balm against all melancholia    Ariel- The alchemical man    Britannia's future is on the stage    The girl gang takes a break from the rigors of anarchy in the UK.    Borgia Ginz- over-actor and king of all media    A late afternoon soiree    I'll dream about those dreamy eyes.

         The Honeymoon Killers- This early independent film is based on the Lonely Hearts Murders of the late 1940s. A Spaniard and his portly princess travel the country swindling desperate women. She presents herself as his sister, but she’s helplessly jealous and completely unsympathetic. She’s just a desperate as their victims. This should come as no surprise. They met through the very pen pal services from which they draw their victims.  Neither character is enjoyable enough to spend 90 some minutes with. Martha is needy, unsightly and the ultimately the sicker of the two. Ray Fernando is an ignorant, morally bankrupt swindler who just happens to have a sparkling smile and an accent to match. This is based on fact, so you can’t fault the filmmaker for making them so unlikable. That understanding helped me get through one screening, but I doubt that I could manage another.  As far as style goes, I imagine that this was fairly groundbreaking upon release. It’s shot with an almost documentary realism. This was common in Italy and France, but uncommon in the states. There are moments of pulpy style, but they actually helped the film move along. Supposedly Martin Scorsese was originally interested in making the film. I can’t help but assume that he would have given the characters some humanity. At the very least, they may have been tolerable. As it stands, it stands as a film of questionable historical importance and slight value as entertainment.    Sign me up!    The ravishing Martha and her best beau. Is Ray Fernando the criminal's real name or just an homage to my hero: Fernando Rey?    She may not be much to look at but she knows her confections. It's a shame that you can't see her with her very own $1.85 veal chop.    Ray gets a new toupee.    The caption speaks for itself    One of a few non-documentary style shots    The end result of a romance with Ray

              I am Curious: Blue- Blue and Yellow are companion pieces. According to the director, one does not follow the other. They co-exist in order to offer two sides of the same story. They owe their fame to a landmark obscenity case. By permitting the films to be shown in the US, the Supreme Court effectively did away with the production code. The films have obvious historical significance, but when examined out of that context are they still relevant?  I'm inclined to say "NO!". It's been a while since I saw "Yellow", but as I remember it, it was even less interesting than "Blue". Both consist of strings of interviews about topics that must have been relevant to politically active Swedes during the mid-sixties. Do I care about Franco, the Swedish class system or the sexual revolution? Not at all.  The film is billed as "sexually explicit", but such scenes rarely occur. They comprise less than 10% of the film. They may have been shocking in the 60s, but they seem tame today. I wonder if the government was more concerned with censoring the anti-American messages. They are central to the film's message. The rampant sexuality is not only secondary, but filthy and utterly forgettable.  If you remove the irrelevant political content, what are you left with? A pointless narrative about an unlikable girl. It tries hard to be clever. The director appears from time to time to remind us that we are watching a film. The actors play different parts. At times, they even appear as themselves. I'm all for playing with the medium, but it feels too smug and self serving. After all, the film is all about political protest and upheaval.  I was pleased with the look of the film. It wasn't spectacular, but it looked far better than what I remember of "Yellow". The problem is, the films are neither relevant, interesting or especially thought provoking. "Blue" is a museum piece and it isn't worth a second viewing.     Director Vilgot Sjorman and star Lena Nyman "cleverly" remind us that we are watching a film.    Was the Supreme Court afraid of this poster?    Or this wholly un-erotic display?     A progressive young man       3/4 of the film is filled with such exciting conversation       I need one of those signs for my basement wall.    One of a handful of interesting shots

           Boat Trip- It’s hard to imagine Cuba Gooding Jr. sinking lower than “Snow Dogs”, but this film offers definitive proof his decline. It can’t imagine the person who greenlighted it. You surely know the concept. Two desperate men accidentally take a gay cruise. It’s a fate worse than death, but they find reprise in a dance instructor and a Swedish tanning team.I This is the perfrect example of a film that can only be laughed at.To laugh with the characters or when the director hopes to amuse you is unimaginable.The attempts at humor are as misguided as the plot synopsis. Are we expected to be amused when the fat sidekick gives a speech on how easy gay men will be to rip off at poker? His reasoning: they giggle a lot.How about the endless parading of cartoonish caricatures of homosexual men? Is the impossibly idiotic tanning team an attempt to attract pre-pubescent boys? If so, I imagine that even they would be disappointed. While trash like “You Got Served” is inept enough to amuse any critical viewer for 95 minutes, “Boat Trip” is yawn inducing and utterly forgettable. I selected some of the crucial shots. Hopefully, they’ll save you from experiencing it for yourself. My computer wasn't able to remove the Spanish subtitles, so they remain in certain shots.        Cuba's big moment- the talent show        Cuba's friends share a nice, shiny bottle of 50 YEAR OLD cognac. Imagine the type of person&nbsp;who would&nbsp;purchase such a vintage without a set of snifters to accompany the spirit.        Poker professionals        Will Ferrel- The man behind the mistaken booking        A healthy romance        Groundbreaking special effects work        The result of the flare        The biting comedy of the outtakes reel.

           Maborosi- It was a decent film that was spoiled by a poor transfer. Considering that it is a 1997 film, it’s pretty disappointing.Ozu’s influence in noticeable in almost every shot. It’s difficult for a student to compare to a master, so I’m sure that watching it immediately following “Early Summer” hurt it. Basically, it’s the story of a woman who loses her husband.She moves to a seaside village and attempts to forge a new life for her child.It’s admirably shot and thoughtful, but the transfer kept me from really enjoying it.The pace is slow. Slower than Ozu. It’s short on humor, so it feels languorous. The lead woman gives a good performance, but she’s more a mannequin than anything else. Ozu’s choices bring us closer to his characters, but Maborosi has the opposite effect. It feels detached and distant. It’s worth a look if you like contemporary Japanese cinema, but I doubt that it will be a top priority for most viewers.     FYI: except where noted, transfer wise, the shots are among the best looking in the film. The subtitles are non-removable.        The heroine        The ill fated husband         A sorrowful farewell        Trains and Bicycles- major thematic elements        Mother and child in transition        The sea side atmosphere        Children at play        The lazy days of Summer        Recalling the past        More adventures at the shore        The transfer at its worst. This is typical for any dimly lit scene.

           Early Summer- Ozu’s style is difficult to capture in still frames and even more so in written word. It’s something that must be experienced firsthand.I’m going to share pictures of a few of the crucial characters along with a handful of the film’s beautiful still frames. I hope that it gives you a sense of his style.    &nbsp;   I didn’t realize it until the first few minutes of the DVD, but this was the first Ozu that I saw on VHS about eighteen months ago. Many of his films share seasonal titles and familial plots, so they are easily confused. I was under the impression that I saw one of his “Spring” films, but obviously that was not the case. This time around, it was like visiting old friends.I’ve grown accustomed to his style and his actors.I didn’t have to pay much attention to the plot. I was able to sit back and enjoy the details.The lead character is 27 years old and yet to marry.Family and friends pressure her to find a companion.That’s about all that you need to know. Plot is inconsequential.The details and the shot composition are the primary elements of the Ozu experience.Once you fall into his spell (as I have), they are comforting films.Superficially, nothing much happens, but I can imagine re-watching all that I own (four and this is soon to be the fifth) for the rest of my life. I hope you give him a chance. If you do, try to see at least three before deciding that he isn’t for you.They have a way of getting better each time.       The central family       The heroine indulges herself       Friendship       Yes, it's Ladies' night. Note the divide between the married and single women       A typical indoor composition       A wonderful use of space       Trip to the garden       A&nbsp;beautiful pillow shot       The setting       Clothes on the line- a familiar visual motif in Ozu's work

           You Got Served- This is a bad movie of the best type.Although it tries to be hip, it’s incredibly uninspired.It follows a generic 3 act “sports film” structure.Stylistically, it balances two styles.Half of the film looks like any number of poorly shot, cliché ridden rap videos.Everything else is sitcom style.The actors are atrocious.Major sub-plots fizzle out without much more than ten seconds of dialogue.The film takes place in a handful of bland settings: a dance warehouse that looks like it’s on a soundstage, a broke-down ghetto home that is filled with product placement appliances that are well beyond the characters’ means, a sit-com restaurant, a basketball court, an incredible in-authentic practice area. Finally, the characters end up in an upscale glass building.    &nbsp;   Considering the film’s aspirations of being the “straight street West Side Story”, it is incredibly sanitized.Expletives are beeped out on the soundtrack.Violence is rarely even hinted at.The leads make deliveries for a “menacing” thug.What they deliver is never mentioned.I can only assume that it is child pornography.Why else would they store it in brightly colored backpacks?The adult characters (a grandmother and a referee) frequently moralize and offer helpful advice. On top of that, nothing is played ironically.The filmmakers seem to be satisfied with their creation.They may believe that their film has “street cred”, but that’s the furthest thing from the truth.Of course, if you take a minute to listen to the commentary, you’ll realize that you’re dealing with a bunch of men who were lucky to survive the rigors of a kindergarten education.&nbsp; The film also fails to discuss the logistics of how splitting a pot of $600 up to a once in a lifetime $50,000 could possible change the lives of a crew of ten.&nbsp;      This is the sort of film that just BEGS for screen shot commentary.What can I do but oblige?            Our Puppy Dog Protagonist           Protagonist two in his "Broke" Grandma's House.&nbsp;&nbsp;Take note of his&nbsp;Princeton Medical School accepted sister.           Fledgling romance creates a rift between the heroes.           Emerald certainly looks intimidating.           An impressive action sequence           The referee offers a bit of life changing advice.           Skillz Skillz Skillz           Hardcore Action           "Tonight, you SUCKERS GOT SERVED!!!!!!!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "rich" crew is led by a "real" punk.           The precious Lil' Saint           The drama rises to Shakespearan levels.           The BIG time           Lil Kim knows no holds barred, straight street action when she sees it.

           And Now. . . Ladies and Gentlemen-    I always enjoy Jeremy Irons’ performances and this was no exception.The concept was interesting.He’s a thief.The female co star is a jazz singer.Both are suffering from unexplainable blackouts.Their paths cross in  Morocco.It’s all about coincidence, the fallacy of memory, failed dreams and end of an era.The director uses different stock/lighting to demonstrate various internal states (dreams, flashbacks etc.)It was fairly effective, but the film wasn’t as engaging as it could have been.It gets the jazzy/exotic tone right, but fails to make much of a lasting impression.I did enjoy seeing some of Irons’ disguises.Keep in mind that many of them are products of a faltering memory, so they are rather comical.At least, that’s the way that I viewed them.         Irons and the Jazz Singer        Irons' Vessel        The Wife        The Path to the Healer        The Moroccan Hotel        "If I Want, I'll Wear Girl Clothes."- Dios        Debonaire?

      I would like to thank Brook for providing space for this site and for getting it up and running. It promises to be rewarding for any cinephile who happens to discover it.  If you like what you see here, you may want to take a look at my old screening log.  urlLink http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=asphodel5  It may not have the visual appeal of this new and improved edition, but it documents everything that I saw between December 2003 and July 2004. I may never revisit some of those films, so you are advised to give it a visit.

           Sylvia- The critical consensus was correct.Keep in mind that I like Paltrow AND Plath’s poetry.Many reviews complained that the film was too depressing.That wasn’t the problem.It was a superficial overview of the years that Plath knew Ted Hughes.Considering all that they had to work with, it was very uninspired.The acting was spot on, but the direction and pacing was barely better than a Lifetime special.It should come as no surprise that Sylvia fails to survive.Since the audience knows what is going to happen, you have to make sure that they care about her.The pacing was so slow and the events so unmemorable that I was barely able to finish it.It’s really a shame because they had a capable Sylvia.        A High Point- Pastoral Chaucer        The Venerable Ted Hughes        Sylvia Adrift        Desperation in Blue        Sylvia Tries to Cheer Up        Eros is Sick       Port of Shadows- This Carne film was far superior to Drole de Drame, but not on the level of “Children of Paradise”.It’s roughly the equivalent of “Daybreak”.That is, moody, but not entirely satisfying.It has a number of strong points.First and foremost, the dialogue is wonderfully poetic (surprise, surprise).All of the scenes with the female lead were memorable, but apart from Gabin, the other male characters were dull.The atmosphere looks ahead to Hollywood noirs.It’s worth a look because there aren’t many good examples of poetic realism on DVD, but it wasn’t as satisfying as some of the Warner/Universal noirs that came out earlier in the month.        Our Hero: Jean Gabin        Our Heroine-Michèle Morgan       Trouble With the Bumper Cars        A Tender Moment        Port of Shadows        Atmosphere       The Sea is Watching- It was much better than I expected.Kurosawa wrote the script, but it was produced posthumously.It focuses on the lives of a group of geisha during the samurai age.It’s a return to one of the director’s favorite periods, but a story that is more in line with Mizoguchi.Personally, I’m prefer Kurosawa when he isn’t focusing on masculinity and heroism, so I was pleased with the film. Obviously it may have been stronger if he had directed it, but from what I’ve seen of his 90s output (Dreams and Rhapsody in August), I prefer this script.It’s really a beautiful film and well worth your time if you care for the subject matter.       Our Heroine: O-Shin       A reminder of "Red Beard"       An Idyllic Pillow Shot       Our Heroine at Work       Another "Red Beard" Reminder       A Serene Moment
