      Today didnt really do anything at all. I watched the Street Fighter anime last night and it wasn't too bad. Today I was gonna watch the ninja movie, but my tape player is missing. I think my mom took it with her last night (for some reason) and decided to leave it at her partying location.  I just played Rag all day, took a shower and washed my stank ass, and ate a fudgesicle. Life is peachy.

      Today my dad woke me up at 7 (cant I get some DAMN SLEEP AROUND HERE!!?) and asked- no,  told  me to come help him install my aunt's new shower. It just started as a small leak in her tub, but now shes going nuts and demanding a whole new shower! Not to mention a new toilet and sink we've yet to put in...  We head to Lowe's to get some caulk so we can... caulk up the shower I guess. Somehow, we get up on a conversation about what construction vehicles my dad's operated over the course of his life. He tells me that he's "rode just about everything you see on the side of the road". I'm looking around: Doghouses? Trees? Garbage Cans? What the hell was he smoking?  Anyways, we're putting the doors on the shower and we realize that they're too big to fit the shower. So, my dad's stuck in the shower because the doors cant slide enough to make a big enough opening to get in/out of. I fall out laughing. Smokes pouring out of my dad's ears, like the demon he is, and i'm laughing my ass off.  This evening, the folks are off to some lady's birthday party. So, i'll be here alone. Again. On the computer all night. Eating cold pizza.

      Oh yeah! Instead of  renting  a movie, I bought some anime on VHS for only 10 bucks!! I got  Wrath of the Ninja  and  Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie . I certainly hope the Street Fighter anime is signifigantly better than that live action bullshit movie they made sometime in the late/mid 90's. If you dont know what i'm talking about, BE GLAD! That movie damn near ruined my view of the Street Fighter franchise.  The Ninja movie, however, has to be good. You cant go wrong with ninjas.

      Well, i'm bout to go get some pizza (mmmmm pizza) and maybe rent a movie if I have the cash. But first i'd like to record an asinine revelation I just had.  You know how your life is supposed to 'flash before your eyes' right before you die? I got to wondering, is this life? Or just the flash?

      Well, I guess this is my blog. Im going to be writing down random stuff whenever I feel like it. If you manage to get here, feel free to read it or not. I really dont give a fuck.  Today is my first day off on summer break (wee!). It isnt really that great because i've miserably failed the grade, due to me missing somewhere around 50 days during the year. Personally, i'm just pretty glad to be wasting more time on the computer. Mindlessly staring at the glow of the monitor during ungodly hours of the night. Ahh, my sweet addiction.  Oddly, I didnt sleep in today. I woke up at fucking 6 and couldnt go back to sleep. I'm pretty tired now but theres better stuff to do than sleep at the moment. The first thing I did was start up the computer (naturally) and check out my favorite forums at  urlLink Animeleague.net .Nothing that new or exciting was going on there, so I hopped over to GameFAQs and voted on the poll. Since there wasn't shit to do anywhere and Kazaa was being a bitch like always, I decided to play some Ragnarok. After a few monotonous hours of killing creatures as a cute little swordsman sprite, I cut off the game and called up Rea (my close friend) as I promised her I would. We talked for 30 minutes then she went to go get some lunch. After screwing around back on the internet, I got the inspiration to start up my blog... and here I am.
