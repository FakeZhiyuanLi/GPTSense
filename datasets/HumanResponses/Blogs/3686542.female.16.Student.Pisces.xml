      Have you noticed how all of my titles have been song titles or lyrics, mawahaha, i wonder if you spotted that did you??   I'm playing minesweeper with becci. She's so cool.   Quiz results time:    Fight Club!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      LOVING ONE. You need  safety in your relationship. You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing that he will protect you and you can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable.

      It's been a few days since i last wrote but we have hot water. Yey, i am so happy plus i'm getting new clothes and maybe shoes tommorow so i can't wait.   I was a little sad at the end of JOA today even though it was a sorta happy ending it was sad too. I was noooooooo.   I had a dream about Chris last night it was very odd. We were fish and sally-anne was a fish too and another boy, it was very odd and we swam for ages but then we turned into people and i was climbing out of the pool which was right next to the trainstation, like in the road when Chris took my hand and pulled me back under the water but the crazy thing was i could breathe and we swam to the bottom of the pool, he picked something up and we swam back up again and then he did this incredable smile that made me melt (not literally).  Then i was on the school bus and lee and scott were there and they were laughing at my socks, which were my whote arm warmers. Then sophie was smiling at me. I got home and amanda asked me if i wanted to earn some money cleaning houses. SO we went to this huge house down my road and it was open so we cleaned the stuff and took the dog that lived there "kate" for a walk. I accidently stepped on this man's garden adn he began yelling at me. We gave back the dog and then i woke up. it was very weird.

      Heya  OMG i am in love with Liz Phiar, her music is brilliant and her lyrics are totally to heart.   I just watched Joan of Arcadia, new episode called "The Uncertinty Principle". It was a very heart warming ep and it left you knowing that he still cares. :D yey.  I really get involved with my Joan of Arcadia.  Anyho I customised my top today but wearing my blue arm pieces under my black top. it looks cool. so my plan is to buy more 3 quarter length tops and more arm pieces and make cool stuff. :D   on the downside i have to wait til thursday to get my necklace and ring. And we still have no effing hot water. Bloody plumbers. I bathed in water like 2cm full. Then i got snappy cos i couldn't get the conditioner out. We have old pipes. :(  Quote: Friedman on grace kissing Luke. "Did he just convert her from mac to pc?"

      well tonight Joan is back and i thought after each of my updates i'd inlcude a quote of the day. mwahahah.  Anyways well my life is alright. I'm still not speaking to my father and my sister just came back from uni but bar that i'm fantastic. (cough*sarcasm*cough)  I can't even have a convostaion with my sister anymore, yesterday i was watching Busted's new video "Thunderbirds" for the new movie and i was like it looks pretty good and then my sister sat up in her chair and was like "well actually kirsty, it's all americanised and they have updated it way to much. The original writer of the comincs (insert name here) hardly had anything to do wiith it and was very dissapointed, blah blah blah" it went on like that for about 10 minutes. She was spurting crap becuase the person who wrote the comics has legal rights.  And  i told her about when i watched a bit of Kill Bill 2. i watched the first 4 minutes and turned it off. It was soooooooooooooooooooo crap. All she was doing was talking about basically how great she was.  Then my sister was all like "well you have to have watched other Tarentino films to appricate the way he changes the perception of certain things blah blah blah" another 10 minutes of crap.   Sorry aren't we supposed to have a opinion now, so what i'm sure you hate some of my favourite films and ever since she has come back from uni she has had this superior tone to her voice whenever she speaks to me like she's better than me.  If i have to listen to one more thing she tells me about "the lightening effect features in this scene are okay, they don't bounce it of the trimordial beams enough to give a good picture of what it would really be like if they were infact inside the beast but there not which is completly flase...Blah blah blah." i might have to use a line from MOM from futurama and say  "Cram a squirrel up your ass" Mom's great:D  Enought ranting, i'm doing a update for Arcadian Rebellion and mum is really thinking about letting me go and transfer schools to america. super:D  I can't wait, it'll really be a fresh start which i so despartly need.   Anyho i'll leave you with a quote from Luke (Joan of Arcadia) from the episode Drive, He said.  Joan and Luke see a figure walking along the road towards the car. Luke:(panicked voice) Go around him, he's got a chainsaw.  Later:D

      Wow, they've changed Blogspot. tee hee.  &nbsp; So i'm listening to the Shrek 2 album. I saw the film the otherday and i loved it. I want to see it all again but nobody wants to go. So i'm going to drag Sarah to it when she gets back from Inverness. :D She stayed over my house the over day though she didn't sleep as she was getting on a plane a few days later and had to work. We watched loads of Futurama and we both were crying with laugher at some episodes. She is definitly my Futurama buddy. She's so hilarious. She has the same kind of humour as me too (the sarcastic funny type eg. The Emperor’s New Groove) so we both laugh at stuff like that and seeing as Futurama is that sort of type it was great. I wished she could stay for longer but she had to go but i hope she'll want to see it with me. Also she rang me a few minutes before she left for her holiday to say that she would see me when she gets back. She is the coolest. Later that night i saw Shrek 2, so funny. The songs and the jokes. Puss in Boots rocks.  &nbsp; I got a new PS2 game yesterday. You've gotta love Seventh Heaven. It's my local game shop but it has all oldish type games, like i got Shadow of Memories, which you wouldn't have been able to find at one of the bigger stores, *coughGAMEcough*. I also got Shadow Hearts from there, whcih you cannot find anywhere now. I love that shop so much, it's grand and mighty cheap too.  So this game is by Konami, and the begining is when your character, Eike Kusch, is stabbed in the back while walking. Then you meet this weird person (with a creepy voice) who gives you  "his" Digipad through which you can go back in time and change your fate. Although just saving yourself once doesn't work, the hour at which you die changes and you need to find out who your assasin is and take him or her out so you don't die. It's a very good game and runs on real time. Classy. &nbsp; That's all i got now
