      May 22, 2001  God, I'm not very happy today.  I'm tired.  I'm irritable. I'm feeling down and discouraged. Completely worn out.   I need You to fill me with Your Spirit. Give me new life! Hungry & thirsty I wait. You are my Father. Don't let me be alone. I need energy. I will find peace only at rest in You. Change my heart. Forgive me. Bless me, oh Lord. Please don't let me go!

      Oh Lord, where have I been lately. It's been so long since I've come to You in prayer. Please forgive me for walking away. Forgive me for the sinful things I've done. Set me free from the bondage I am in. Renew my heart and make me come alive again with joy.

      July 23, 2001 I don't think You love me. I'm not even sure You exist. I know that makes You mad. It makes You want to punish me.  How can I trust You? She died. I'm still ugly. He wants her, not me.  I want peace in my heart. But You refuse.  I want joy in my soul.  But You refuse. I want to know You. But You refuse.  How can I trust You to save my soul? If You let me die this way now? I bared myself. Went on my knees. Repented and submitted. You turn away from me. All day long I pray for my eyes to be opened All night long I ask you to help me believe But when the sun rises I'm still just empty As guilty I want to be free Now sure how I got here I'm not where I want to be I think You must hate me Or maybe You are a myth I never thought I'd think that How can I doubt that you exist? And us Christians we're all hypocrites And You're hearing from the Queen The girl who is so humble Yet she knows everything So again I am praying That You'll erase this doubt...

      July 12, 2001  So ______ was hit by a car. Lord, let that change him. Draw Him near to You. Let my heart not rejoice in his pain.  Is this God moving? Did You avenge me? Psalm 35

      October 7, 2001  How is it possible that You love me? You are an awesome God!  I pray, Lord, that you would heal my wounded heart, mend my aching soul. You love me despite this sin. This blackness in my heart.

      December 7, 2001  Traci came to see me tonight.  She got to see my Christmas tree and my apartment. It was Rick's birthday, so she called him to wish him a happy birthday. Of course, it's also Nicole's and ______.   Not much else for now.

      January 15, 2002  I am really tired tonight. Snowed today. Almost hit a car in front of the post office - slid into it. Tonight I read Genesis 4 & 5. Didn't do the exploration part tonight.  Work was long. But Cindy said I seem to be doing well. Maybe in a few weeks they'll teach me to do more.   Maybe I'll get my new computer tomorrow. Oh Lord - protect me. Thank you so much! I'm sleepy...

      January 14, 2002  Today wasn't a bad day. I walked from Holt Arena to class. I also officially changed my major back to speech. Bought some school supplies. (Like this nifty new pen!)  I met with Ginger from 3:30 to 4:30. We just caught up on things. I am thinking of asking ______ if she wants to do a Bible study or something. Lord, help me know what to do about that.   My DSL modem came today. Should get my new computer soon.   God - I struggle so much with thoughts of self-hatred, and I doubt You. Please, help me see and believe only the truth. I want to live for you! You know my strengths and weaknesses. I want You to be my LORD! Help me obey You and do what is right. Help me have the right heart and attitude. Help me build good, solid relationships. Help my thoughts stay pure and holy.   Tonight I read Genesis 2:4 - 3:24. Satan deceived Eve. She chose to believe the lie, and she "died." Adam blamed her. She blamed Satan. But nobody blamed themselves. Just as God gave us our Spirits, they will one day return to Him.  Lord, save _______. Let Your will be done. Keep me safe tonight. Thank you Jesus!

      January 13, 2002  I went to Church tonight. Sat by Marsha and her friend. Lew spoke on I Peter 3. I am sure that God taught me something, even though I didn't feel it, because I know that His word never returns void. Or something like that.   Traci called me from Kansas City last night. She's going to seminary there. I pray that she doesn't try to "do" too much this semester, and also that things work out financially for her.   I sent ______ a Veggietales e-card, and wrote ______ a short email. I hope they both come to know the Lord! I also pray for ______. Lord, please, move in their hearts and draw them to You.   I pray for school and work tomorrow. But, God is faithful. All is well.

      January 8, 2002  I found a verse today. Well, a couple. 2 Timothy 2:11-13. The last of these verses is good: If we are faithless, He remains faithful. He cannot deny Himself.  Praise God Forever!

      November 27, 2002  hey-  don't know when you'll get this.  i'm at home and i'm a little bored  right now, for no real reason.  i spent my day with my parents and my  10 month old neice and my five year old nephew.    my mom lost her job yesterday, at least until january, so things are  kind of sad around here, but that's ok.  no big deal.  got paid today,  which was cool.   oh, they switched my shift at work, and starting december 8th, i work  4:30 to 9:30.  i'm a little pissed, because it means less money.  i'm  supposed to have different days off all the time now, too.  but it's  all good.  anywayz, hope your thanksgiving is (was) good, depending on when you  get this.    later
