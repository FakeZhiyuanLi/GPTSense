      So I've been abandoned by some of my friends for other Memorial Day activities.  Ok that's being a bit melodramatic, but they just decided to do other things and some had to work (Kate that ought to make you happy).  Now I'm not sure if I want to go to iBar.  I'm sure I'd still have a good time, hell I could have a could time at a bar mitzvah, but having some friends in the crowd would have been nice.  Looks like I'll just make some temporary friends for the evening, I seem to be good at that lately.  Hmmm, to go or not to go.  Someone convince me.  Let's celebrate some memorials people!   Funny Work Story:  So I'm helping out a black family from Atlanta, GA and they are part of a large group, all of the young girls of which are all part of the Girl Scouts troop.  Mom's has to get something off of the chartered bus before we go and get them a taxi because they want to stay a little longer.  So me and pops are standing there, me with all of his luggage on my cart, and looking at all of the women and children waiting to get on the bus he decides to start up some conversation.   HIM:  Look at dat there.  ME:  What's that sir?  HIM:  Look at them women.  Have you ever seen so many big ol' mammas in all yo' life?    ME:  Well uh... (not wanting to be insulting because his wife isn't exactly Kate Moss)  HIM:  You know why don't ya?  ME:  I uh....  HIM:  'Cause they be eatin' nothin' but pigs' feet, chitlins, and collard greens...true Atlanta boy.  Look at that, dog!  ME:   (this is where I try and not laugh so hard I drop his stuff and piss myself)   A little bit later we are waiting for his daughter to get her badge that I guess her troop was awarding the girls for a successful cruise or something.  So there we are, still waiting when cool Mo's pops pipes up again.   HIM:  Look at dat.  That is a true Atlanta ghetto ceremony right there.  ME:  Is it?  HIM:  No, we can't have the ceremony at a nice dinner party.  Can't have the ceremony on the ship.  Naw, my daughter's got to wait outside da' bus in the sun jus to git some damn badge.  ME:  Yeah, that's a little ridiculous.  HIM:  You damn straight boy.  ME:   more subdued laughter ensues   That was the highlight of my day, well so far anyway.  So what to do?  I've got movies to watch, beer to drink, and I should post some movie reviews.  See you out later on people, perhaps in downtown or perhaps on the other side.  I got nothin' but love for ya'.  PEACE!  ~Fry

      Went out last night to a shitty sports bar in Merritt Island that a friend works at.  Adam and I had a good laugh.  We got to watch an "artist" try and throw some tired ass game at some friends.  Too fucking funny for conventional words I tell you.  But hey, the guy let us put some drinks on his tab in an effort to impress the women, so that was cool.  Work was work, nothing special.  Saw an Elvis impersonator on vactation, that was funny.    Looks a whole gaggle of us are going out to iBar tomorrow night for Memorial festivities.  I imagine it is going to be packed, but it should still prove to be a good time.  Go out peeps.  If you happen to see a Fry, give me a shout.  We'll be partying like it's 1999!!  Now I'm at my parents house.  They went out to a party, my parents rock.  Ate some dinner, having a cocktail, and now sitting at the compy and watching Alias...again.  Season 2 is almost in the bag.  Kind of a slow news day it seems.   urlLink Michael Jackson  is in the news again, it seems his trial date has been set.  Poor Michael, oh how America loves to see a person fall, truly tragic.  Giving me even more reason to want to see Fahrenhet 9/11, it seems that Michael Moore had interviewed beheaded American  urlLink Nick Berg  for his movie.  How crazy is that?!  It'll be here soon though, the people have spoken.  Turns out ex-NFL player Pat Tillman may have been killed from  urlLink allied fire .  Isn't that some shit!  Nice job from the world's greatest military eh?  Here's something kind of strange, it seems this kid in Britain  urlLink used an Internet spy plot to arrange his own murder.   Isn't that an interesing use of Internet resources.  I guess the kid didn't know you could look up porn on the Internet or something.  Speaking of porn, the leasding banker and director of the Bank of Ireland was forced to resign after it was found that he looked at  urlLink porn on the office network.   Now come on, the porn wasn't of an illegal nature.  What's the big fucking deal?  I bet those he's fairly pissed at those IT security guys the bank hired.   Go Marshall, he's gonna get some from the NSA chick!   Adam,  urlLink check this out.   A Bukowski documentary, I'm sure it's good.  All right, I'm good for now.  I'll catch you all later, or maybe even see you tomorrow night.  Peace, and much love to ya'.

      Well I must apologize for not having any posts recently of any merit.  I've been a bit distracted lately by things great and small, among them the second season of Alias.  Like I said, I hate it when I get so addicted to a show and can't stop watching it.  The other shitty thing is that I start to slack on my NetFlix and end up keeping a movie for more than a day, which is totally taboo for me.  I've had   The Secret Lives of Dentists   for like 2 days and still haven't watched it.  Damn Yous!!  So now what?  What comes next?  What's the score here?   I think Sark is having second thoughts about his 'parternership'.   My mom and I are going to get our passports today (hopefully).     I started reading   Fast Food Nation   by Eric Schlosser.  This is an excellent book for anyone who's ever wanted to stop eating fast food not only from McDonald's or any other fast food restaraunt.  It exposes the lies propagated by these uber corporations and how they will do nearly anything to turn a profit, including disgusting marketing campaigns aimed at children.  I think I need to lay off of the non-fiction fare for a little while, it is causing me to hate and be more disgusted with the world more and more everyday.  Although I do want to read   What Liberal Media   which I'm sure won't be too good for the ol' neurons.  I don't know I am compelled to read so much of this stuff, the truth hurts but man I just can't help it.  I just want to know what's going on, even though I hate what is going on.  Hopefully one day I'll be able to do like Johnny Depp does, make my money through American Media (movies, books, news, whatever I can do) and then live somewhere else in the world that is much more pleasant.  I hear Austrailia is a nice place to live.  Have you ever met or seen an Austrailian that doesn't get along with anybody?  That's what I thought.  Eh, that's all.  See ya.

       So our fearful leader laid out his  urlLink plan for the future of Iraq  last night.  The goal is to transfer sovereign power to Iraq by June 30th, yet Bush didn't really say much how long troops will have to stay there.  I'm sure the Iraqis are happy to hear this as they are  urlLink demanding more freedom and a swift end to the occupation.   A lot of people might see this as being ungrateful,  but hey, those people's houses aren't getting  urlLink raided and looted by U.S. soldiers.      Bush's Five Point Plan:      Working with the United Nations in naming interim government leaders. -  Oh, so now he wants to work with the U.N., after so easily disregarding them over a year ago...uh, ok.   Eliminating security threats and bolstering Iraqi police forces. -  I think you've got to plant the security threats (i.e. WMD's) before you can eliminate them.   Rebuilding the country by focusing on reconstructing infrastructure. -  I guess it wouldn't be a bad idea to help them rebuild the place that we helped destroy; I guess this is a good way to create work for American Independent contractors.   A national election to be held in January. -  With a candidate of the Administrations choosing I imagine so that we can control him like another puppet just like they did in Peru.   Broadening international support, primarily through a U.N. resolution that will detail the June 30 handover of power to a new Iraqi government and outline how much say Iraqis will have over armed forces in their country. -  Gee that is mighty generous of us to decide how much say-so they have in their own country, sounds like a fair plan of action to me but I bet the Iraqis might think otherwise.    On a semi-related note, the US Military is still trying to prove that  urlLink didn't bomb a wedding but a safehouse for foreign fighters.   Hmm, I wonder if the fighters were sitting on the bride's side or the groom's side?  Either way I guess they got 'em as the death toll stands at 45, which includes women and children.  Smart weapons my ass!  A weapon is only as smart as its creator and its operator.  In sort of good news Bush's public approval rating is  urlLink at an all time low.   Of course these polls are never that accurate and carry a large margin of error but hey, it sounds good on paper.  Currently him and Kerry are fairly close in the polls, this is still anybody's race. I think the clincher will be when Kerry finally  urlLink announces his running mate.   Wouldn't it be great if he chose John Edwards, although I don't think that is going to happen.     Last night I couldn't get to sleep until close to 6 AM, thus the late night blogging that ensued.  Even more odd is the fact that I still couldn't sleep past like 10 (I think got up about a quarter til), what the fuck!?  Funny thing is, I haven't felt more creative and inspired than while in the grip of those insomnia-tic hours.  I did a lot of reading, research on stuff, and breezed through some homework.  Most curious captain.  The morning was also devoted to doing more homework and reading, as is par for the course these days.  For some reason I don't feel like leaving the apartment today, but who knows, I might decide to make a trip to  urlLink the bookstore  for some coffee and wandering a little later.    I need to do some more writing I think, perhaps after the coffee.  A short story perhaps, or a scene, or maybe just a dirty limerick, but most likely just another blog post.    Catch you all later...much love and all assorted accompanying jazz.

      See what happens when I don't drink beer, here it is almost 5AM and I am still awake.  Someone send help in the form of tranquilizers, red and blue seconals, lipstick-red tubenals, or some fucking valerian root damn it!  I actually don't mind the mild bouts of insomnia I get every once in a while, it affords me plenty of time to get things done like reading and researching stuff.  The only problem is, once I finally do get to sleep I'll do so for far to long.  I'm a 'get-up-early-and-make-the-most-of-a-day' kind of person for the most part (there have been exceptions so no need pointing that out K8), so it fucks me up when I wake up late.    For most of you the following is going to be incredibly dull, be forewarned.  I've been reading about  urlLink Nick Denton , President of  urlLink Gawker  and all of its related blogs.  There is a great article in Wired about Denton and his  urlLink contributions to the business of blogs and nanopublishing  ( NOTE: the actual print article is much more thorough ), as well as some of his competition, i.e.  urlLink Weblogs Inc.   This has all further increased my desire to get more into the blogosphere and perhaps one day join the ranks of the blogging elite such as  urlLink Glenn Reynolds ,  urlLink Wil Wheaton ,  urlLink Evan Williams ,  urlLink Jason Kottke , and  urlLink Dave Winer .  For some reason this type of Internet/literary celebrity intrigues me, and considering I abhor all other type of celebrity that is a little bit scary.  Gawker is currently on the search for six more elite bloggers to add sites to their repertoire on subjects ranging from dating to video games.  Now of course I am no where near being able to be considered for either of those postions, one of my new goals is to get to that point however.  To get paid to sit at home and blog, what they fuck could be better than that?  Currently Gawker is the publisher of several sites including  urlLink Gawker  itself which is basically a blog of NYC gossip and who's who type of stuff.   urlLink Fleshbot  is dedicated to porn, but as an industry and not as just, well porn.  The techno-gadget site  urlLink Gizmodo  is one of my favorites and focuses on up-and-coming technology and of course, gadgets.   urlLink Defamer  is basically the west-coast version of Gawker, giving you all the latest in Hollywood news and what have you.  To round it all off we have the politically-left site  urlLink Wonkette  which gives all the latest on the happenings on Capitol Hill and abroad.  The thing that is different about these sites is that they aren't written by professional writers or journalists, but just by bloggers who happened to have certain wit and literary savant-like ability.  They all bring such a refreshing angle to their subject matter that it almost doens't matter if you are into it or not, it's still intersting to read.  So that's that.  Who knows, perhaps one day I'll be getting paid for sitting here on my ass staring at an LCD screen and slowly going blind.  I'm sure I'll never see my name in lights, but I'd sure like to see it in  urlLink hypertext  next to a bunch of ads that I'm making money from.  Don't worry, I will.

       As I stated a while back I recently read a book by Max Barry called   Jennifer Government   which I loved.  Since then I have been participating in a game through Max's website called  urlLink NationStates  which is a lot of fun.  What you do is create a small, fledgling nation, decide on its political views, and then decide on issues that come up at a rate of your choosing.  Depending on the nature of your decisions, this will affect your nation and its growth as a Inoffensive Centrist Democracy, Capitalist Paradise, or perhaps even a Psychotic Dictatorship.  You also have the choice to join the United Nations and vote on global issues that will also affect your nation in the long run, as well as pledge loyalty to other groups and parties.  All in all, it is a very interesting game that I'd recommend checking out.  Here is the current state of my nation:    The People's Republic of FryGuy is a very large, environmentally stunning nation, remarkable for its punitive income tax rates. Its compassionate population of 103 million have some civil rights, but not too many, enjoy the freedom to spend their money however they like, to a point, and take part in free and open elections, although not too often.  It is difficult to tell where the omnipresent government stops and the rest of society begins, but it juggles the competing demands of Education, Social Welfare, and the Environment. The average income tax rate is 58%, and even higher for the wealthy. A large private sector is led by the Cheese Exports, Retail, and Gambling industries.  Expensive lawyers are hired to defend citizens in court for public urination charges against their pets, graffiti graces every city's streets, motorists must pay to enter inner-cities during peak hours, and all guns must be registered. Crime is relatively low. FryGuy's national animal is the dragon, which frolics freely in the nation's many lush forests, and its currency is the Doder.  FryGuy is ranked 4709th in the region and 75,074th in the world for Nudest.    The reason I mention this is that playing this game has made me think a lot about our nation and the nature of National Issues.  On several issues during the course of my game I have made decisions that I thought would be the best course of action and would aid my people the best, but when the results show up they don't turn out the way I'd planned, as you can probably tell by the description.  So my question is: Is there ever a completely correct solution to an issue that would satisfy all of the people?  Obviously not, that is way too idealistic of a scenario, and it impossible to satisfy the needs of everyone.  This makes me wonder if perhaps I am sometimes a little too harsh on our governing bodies.  Naturally we all want them to make choices and decisions that benefit everyone as much and as equally as possible, but that is just not realistic.  However, our recent situation is inexcusable.  There is not good reason for this conflict, no matter what  urlLink anybody in a bad suit and gang of advisors will try and tell you.   Now I know that his game isn't even close to being a proper simulation, but it does give you a glimpse into the nuances of trying to run a nation.  Could it ever be possible to have a perfect nation?  Is a Utopia where everyone is treated fairly, can breathe clean air, and has the freedom to do as they please but without the chaos and anarchy that usually comes with complete freedom possible?  Scholars, philosophers, and other assorted renegades have argues about this for years with no clear answer.  It seems like such a thing is pretty much a statistical and mathematical impossiblity, but the idea is still an intriguing one.  What things would make up an ideal nation?  Even with all of the bitching and whining I do about this country I find it difficult to come up with a reasonable answer to this question.  I think most people, besides the ub&#235;r intellectuals like  urlLink Noam Chomsky ,  urlLink Normal Mailer , and  urlLink Douglas Rushkoff , would be hard pressed to come up with a solid answer.  How then can we have any right to complain if we don't know exactly what we want?  I think this comes back to pure, raw natural human moral and ethical instincts.  We don't always know exactly why something is wrong or what we need to do to make it better, but we just KNOW that something is malapropos.  We feel it in our heart of hearts that there is something amiss with a system, an issue, or even a President as it were.  And if we feel this way, it is our nature to want to strike out, fight against our oppressors, and right the wrongs that our primal instincts tell us are afoot.  I know that running a nation isn't easy, but I'll be damned if I'm going to wave my right to make commentary on it just because I don't have a credible solution to the problems that face us.  Any thoughts?  So check out the game if you are interested, and send me a telegram if you do so I can check out your nation.       Music that filled my head during this post:      Grand Buffet - Murderfuck  Body Count - Body Count  Al Green - Can't Take My Eyes Off You  Marilyn Manson  Rage Against The Machine - Kick Out the Jams (LIVE)  Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata  Bad Brains - Rock For Light  Prince - Hot Wit U  DJ QBert - Sneak Attack  No Doubt - Move On  I'll see you all on the flip side.  Much love, and keep fighting the good fight.

      Last night was a lot of fun.  Danced a lot, drank....uh, some, almost got into a fight with a dork with bad hair, and made it home safe and sound.  My first class was a little rough this morning but I made it through relatively unscathed.  Went to the bank, ran some other errands, and then home for a much needed nap.  Not much else to report except well, life's not so bad you know.  Well of course there is the war, pollution, Republicans, evil corporations, and the fact that we are led by a giddy, little child-cowboy president.  Other than things like that though, it isn't all bad.    Wow, when a guy that makes millions on stories about war and espionage is  urlLink criticizing the war , you know its got to be getting bad.  Author Tom Clancy speaks out...sort of.   urlLink The ultimate in drunken pranks.   Word to the wise, don't be passing out around me and  , lest you wake up on the ceiling.  So the media is supposed to  urlLink show these bitches respect.   Why?  Perhaps it is because they are a clear example of the president's lack of ability.  If he can't even manage his two daughters, how then can we expect him to be able to run a country or conduct a war (that shouldn't have been conducted in the first place mind you)?   urlLink This is really funny for some reason.   To check out the picture,  urlLink clicky here.   Man these sure are some  urlLink icey balls.    urlLink Heroes and villains.   This really shows how skewed and fucked up Americans can be sometimes.  Truly upsetting it is.  That's all I've got for now.  More stuff later tonight perhaps, when I've had more coffee.

         Weekend Updater Of Random Things:      urlLink Bush takes a tumble , but much to my disappointment not enough of one.  Why couldn't the guy have just fallen completely off a cliff?  Oh well, at least God is trying----ooh I'm going to hell for saying that.   urlLink An interesting Blog  chronicling one's man's journey for more---well just more.  Just click it, you'll understand.  This seems like quite the price to pay to  urlLink get VIP status in a swanky club.   I swear, these little RFID tags are making their way into everything.  I wonder if you can buy stock in the company that holds the patent to these things?  Some more  urlLink fancy photoshoppin'  for your viewing pleasure.  Much like the Matrix, I can't explain this to you, you  urlLink will just have to see it for yourself.   From   again --  urlLink This is what happens  when people just love their job  urlLink  too freaking much.   But hey, at least Billy G. knows how this guy feels about the company.  Here are  urlLink three amazing things  about $2 a gallon gasoline.  The amazing part is how all of this is out of our control and will continue to be.  They got by the balls people!!  It's official people, the Andy Kaufman thing  urlLink is indeed bullshit.   As much as I would have liked this to be true, if only to be one of the greatest scams ever, I figured it was false what with the simple blogger account and all.  I mean come on, Kaufman would be a little more extravagant than that if he was going to magically resurface after 20 years or something.....or would he?     urlLink This looks fucking great...and creepy.   One question:  How'd they make Robert Duvall look so young?  What?!  This movie is really from 1971?  Get right outta town!    For you Orlando girls (and boys) out there, the next time you get some jackass asking for the digits give them this number:  407-338-0036 .  This is Orlando's  urlLink rejection hotline number.   This has gotta hurt....oof.  If you know anyone that wants to get some plastic surgery, just show them  urlLink this little number  and the rest of this site.  Mind you these people have millions of dollars and got to 'the best' surgeons, not the local butchers I'm sure we have here.  "Plastic surgery is the devil Bobby!"  Well, unless it is mandatory of course.  Well, I guess it's not a bad idea  urlLink if you are in a bind.     Aaaaaand here it is.......     BPOD      "Listen to me you little fucker, I don't care what your pachouli-smelling, hippy, liberal parents tell you....I'm not illiterate!  If I hear it again, Shades McSpook back here is gonna see to it that YOU NEVER GET LAID!!"

       Not much going on today.  School.  Today was really fucking hot.  Home.  Studying.  Nap.  Now its time to do a little more work and check out some NetFlix.  More   Sex and the City: Season 6   and   An Evening With Kevin Smith  , which will interesting because I've never seen the guy on stage before.    I've been reading more of this book which has been really interesting.  The thing that sucks is that the more I read it, the more angry it makes me because it shows me more and more how wrong it is for us to be in this conflict.  It pretty much spells out how the Bush cartel sold the American people a war through lies, media manipulations, and the twisiting of facts.  On other news my brother is making an offer on a house, which means that if he gets it, I'll be needing to move soon.  Not that I wasn't planning on it, just not so soon.  I really would rather find a studio or one bedroom somewhere for less than $450, but that seems to be a little difficult.  I'm a hard person to live with (it seems) but it looks as if the best alternative is to find a roommate.  I'd really like to live somewhere dowtown, which I've mentioned before I think.    Enough of that.   urlLink Check this out.   Way to go Bush and Co., looks like you took care of that wicked and evil gang of "wedding terrorists."  Glad to see that you are leaving no stone unturned in the search for.....well whatever it is you're searching for because you haven't made it very clear lately.  This shit makes me want to puke.   For all of those that are pissed off about the price of gas,  urlLink here's something to piss you off.   Gee, thanks for all the help Mr. Bush, glad you care that we are paying out the ass for gas.....oh wait a minute, why would you care?  An increase in gas prices means more money for all of your oil tycoon buddies, well that makes sense.  Yeah, we shouldn't dip into the "emergency" oil reserves, they should be reserved for an emergency, like a war or something....oh wait again.  Well, to be fair there hasn't been an official declaration of war, so it's just another conflict.  It scares me how fast gas prices are increasing.  The scary part is, is that it doesn't matter.  Gas, like water and electricity, is one of those things that we will continue to pay for no matter what.  No matter how expensive it gets we will continue to pay it because the powers that be have made sure we are dependent on it enough to where they can exert that kind of control over us.  It's all about money, power, and control.....oh, and hoes.  Even more interesting is that oil reserves were  urlLink actually up from last week.    The  urlLink Fahrenheit 911  drama is getting even more complicated.  Personally I'm loving it, which I'm sure Michael Moore is also.  You know what they say in Hollywood, there is no such thing as bad publicity.  All of the buzz lately will surely do the same thing for this movie as it did for Mel's   The Passion of the Christ  .  I just hope that it makes it into theaters here in the States sometime before the election, although in reality I don't think that it will make much of a difference.  I wonder if Bush and Eisner have take any secret meetings together at the Magic Kingdom?  I bet ol' Yosemite is a big fan of Frontierland.  All right, that's enough out of me for now.  I've got to get to some DVD watching.....uh oh, and schoolwork too.  Yeah, that's the ticket.  Heeeeeeeeeere's the   BPOD!!!

      So I think I'm going to like my MW classes, even the math class.  The prof. is a really left-leaning liberal guy that is pretty funny, which always helps in a math class.  Funny little story: The guy instructing my programming class is a big, sort of goofy white guy, and he was reading the names off of his list to see if who was who.  Well it "appeared" that there were all guys in the class so when he got to then name Marjorie he sort of said it, and then was like,  "....oh, well she obviously isn't here."   Well this black woman that was sitting pretty much in his direct line of sight say,s  "Excuse me!"   He was pretty embarassed you could tell and I felt bad for the guy.  In his defense she did have her head down and had pretty much no hair on her head, but she did have big, gold, hoop earrings which should have been a sure tip-off (although who can really tell these days?).  It is interesting these days how in a large crowd, especially a college crowd, you can't look around and NOT see at least one person on a cellphone in your field of vision.  I had some time to kill and was watching people mill about and I think that at least 2/3 of everyone that walked by had a cancer antennae up to their head.  I'm not saying there they are bad or whatever, I just found it strange how people are so fucking "attached" to their phone.  Sure I love my damn phone, but I hardly even use the fucker  Intersting, I just got a voicemail from a 321 area code number that is just a low, screeching sound that went on for over a minute.  I now have the strange desire to kill the Prime Minister of....somewhere.      What's The Haps Paps:     urlLink When Biscuits Go Bad.   Watch.  Laugh.  Enjoy.  I think I need to stop reading articles about  urlLink violence in Thailand .  If I keep this up it is going to turn me into a neutrotic mess, well more so anyway.  I'm sure you've all already read about it, but I'll post a link anyhow about  urlLink the ame-sex couples exchanging vows in Massachusetts.   This is surely to spark some sort of riots and violent outbreak, and huge surge in Massachusettes personal lubricant sales.  I for one still don't see the problem with this shit.  It's a curb a fucking inch high that this pretend-moral country can't seem to get over.   "What about the children!?"  they scream.  Yeah, well how about little Billy coming home to find you fucking the mailman and then sitting down to watch some good 'ol wholesome Reality TV?  I bet that's turning him into good little citizen, or at least has him on the path to become a young Republican.  We have more important matters to deal with than this.  Concerning the Nick Berg thing, here is a quick  urlLink list of 50 discrepancies  that may mean the video was faked.  What for?  By whom?  This remains to be seen, but these are interesting facts.  The one about the leg I thought about today when I read in another book a completely seperate story about al-Zarqawi's missing appendage.  Courtesy of  urlLink Kuro5hin.org .   urlLink Eat me!!    urlLink  Brown v. the Board of Education  , now and then.  In case you don't know, this is the famous court case that desegregated schools over 50 years ago.  The argument now is whether white and black students are getting equal levels of education.  No, but that includes white kids living in poverty stricken areas too you know, it's just easier to point out when the majority of said student body is black.  ALL schools need money, better teachers, and more programs to educate students on sex, drugs, and rock n' roll....YEAH!!  This one fucking funny way to  urlLink prevent people from throwing gum on the ground or sticking it to random objects.   We should have these at every theme park, school, and city area around.  Ooh, that's my first million I think.     urlLink IPO fever strikes again!   When will people learn, never buy $3M dollars worth of stock from a Dutchman, duh.   urlLink Another shooting accident?   Read between the lines and it is obvious how shit like this happens.  Get the guns out of there stupid!!  Here is a long statement of facts from the New Yorker showing how  urlLink Donald Rumsfeld most certainly knew.   That evil fuck needs to be beat with a rubber hose.  Just look at the fucking guy, he looks like a Bond villian for crying out loud!  Don and Dick, the ambiguously evil and greedy duo!   urlLink One bomb!  One bomb!  They finally found one bomb!   After over a year the U.S. military has finally found what it was looking for, one single, little bomb.  Now all this war, death, destruction, and ridiculous government spending is totally justified because we've finally found the weapon that would have destroyed the world...woo hoo!!  Hail Dorothy, the wicked witch is dead!   urlLink Fluffy Puff Marshmellows .....ACTION!!   urlLink Dylan saves the day in London.   He's a surfer, he's a rebel, and now the 90210 hearthrob can add hero to his diminishing resume.  He's so dreeeeamy....   urlLink William Hung overshadows all-star cast.   In a hilarious example of the little guy finally winning big, American idol reject sensation William Hung somehow landed on the same bill as the Backstreet Boys, Janet Jackson, and Lenny Kravitz among others.  I can't believe this shit, this is a fine example of America really not knowing what they really find entertaining.  Perhaps its all just a fucking joke, and he is just the best one?  They're all zoo animals, fuck 'em!   urlLink More cool Swedish design shit.   The speakers are cool, but as if speakers weren't fragile enough....let's make them out of glass!  For all you candy lovers who just can't decide if you want to try that new exotic piece of sugary libation, I give you  urlLink BadCandy.com .  Read. Eat. And Enjoy.  ....and now, it's time for your  urlLink Your Moment of Zen.   The donuts blink......    Oof, it's already past 8PM and this is my only post of the day so far.  Looks like this is how it will be during school time, and I didn't even go to TechSkills today either.  Yowzers.  Hm, no movies, need beer, need food.  I'll catch you fiends later when I'm sitting here awake getting blotto and pretending to be a writer.  Here is your   BPOD.....         "Thanks for dying for me.....thanks for dying for me...oh and you, thanks a lot...what? you have a family, well tell them thanks too.....and you, thanks for dying for my war, my daddy appreciates it...."

        "On a long enough timeline the survival rate of everyone drops to zero."        -The Narrator,   Fight Club    A Thai chicken pizza and some beer later I sit, watching a movie a sipping on another Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Tomorrow I start my summer classes which surprisingly enough I am sort of excited about. I haven't been in a regular scholastic environment for a little while and am really looking forward to getting back to it.  Unlike many people I do well in school, I don't mean gradewise though (although I do), but I mean in general.  My mind and self just take so well to being in that sort of environment that I can't wait to get into it again.  It just feels comfortable to me, to be in a learning environment.  Which means that most likely, pending enough time and money, I'd like to one day get a Ph.D in something.  Now I know it is really hard, and that is like 10 years away at least, but damn that would be cool to say that I am a doctor of "something."  So it is.  And then it was.    (?)    Things to look at to hopefully cure boredom:    urlLink This Star Trek kids have finally gone too far.   Enjoying a show is one thing, being an ultra fan is another, but taking time out of your life to learn a completely imaginary language is just damn  loco .  It amazes me how far these fanboys/girls have gone with this love of the Star Trek mythos.  Sure it is a very lovely future to look forward to, but an institute dedicated to an imaginary language, come on ya' freaks!   urlLink Cool photos.   There is something about black-and-white photos of old buildings twisted with other things.  Perfect!   urlLink Tornado + house = FUCK!   Dorothy don't got nothing on this shit.  The guy narrating has a huge future in broadcasting, can't you tell.   urlLink Amazing shirt fold.   I am notoriously bad at folding t-shirts, even after working at a clothing store.  How the fuck is this working.  I, like other people have speculated, is this is a clever video of someone UN-folding shirt played backwards!  No one is that fucking folding-savvy!  For the uninformed, and as a general refresher, this is the a quicky article on the  urlLink history of kissing.   Read it, learn it, know it, and damn it all you kids practice at it.  Kissing is a skill and an art that can be both learned, honed, and mastered.  Trust me, this comes from a king-fu master in the art.  All right I'm tooting my own lame-ass horn, but I'd like to think that I'm good at it.  So says the word on the street anyway.   urlLink Beetle Ghraib , funny shiite!  Humor can cure all of the worlds' problems I think. Well maybe not nuclear holocaust and war-mogered genocide, but close.  Oooh, I've found the Flash app you've all been waiting for!  Are you ready?  Can you feel the fucking excitement!?  I give you the wonderful, amazing, marvelous, and stupendous  urlLink Interactive Church Music Player!   Enjoy people of the dead zombie worshippers.  Ciao!!    Ugh, I've got a few more links but I am too tired to continue, so that's all you get for now.  I WAS going to go out to iBar because I was invited but changed plans at the last minute becuase I decided it would be a better idea to stay in.  Like I said, school again tomorrow at like 8:00 AM.  I can't wait, I'm such a fucking nerd.  Good night all.  Takun ze careth to thee and thine.  Bleah!  ~Fry

      It was nice to sit in the grass at Lake Eola today and read, feel the breeze, and smell the duck shit as it wafted in the wind.  Once again I've been making myself too annoyed with the state of things by reading a book about the lies of Jorge' Bush and his band of Vulcans.  It is disgusting at the way we have ALL been manipulated in this matter.  On a more recent note there are talks of the Nick Berg murder video being a hoax.  Not that the man wasn't killed, just that the released video is apparently wrought with clues that it MIGHT be a conspiracy.  Man, you can't believe anything these days can you.  Through clever editing and special effects one can make the general public believe anything, such as making   Titanic   and   Star Wars: Episode II   look like good movies.  Speaking of Episode II, I was watching it today and comparing it with   LOTR: The Two Towers   and realized something that I knew all along.  Star Wars: Episode II fucking sucks!  I know, you're all going to crucify me, but it is true.  The acting is bad, most of the make-up special effects are terrible, and 90% of the movie is done against a green screen which makes it look incredibly fake.  I am beginning to wonder if the Star Wars franchise would be thriving had it not been for the previous movies, which by the way kick way more ass than the new ones.  If Episode III is any worse than the previous two, I almost wonder if I should just wait for the DVD.  What happened George Lucas?  You lost your vision I think, just like your colleague Steven Spielberg, although I think he's still got a few more good movies left in him.  Now I know that none of these revelations are exactly knew or innovative, but it just struck me again today so I thought I'd bring it up.    In checking out blogs I discovered  urlLink this little gem  which automatically redirects you to a random blog.  Put it in your toolbar to have a pseudo-channel surfing button, only with blogs.  The only problem is that it only works with  urlLink blogger  fueled blogs.  Blogger however has gone through a complete overhaul and totally kicks ass as a free weblogging service.  It is now very customizable, has a bunch of great skins, and lends itself really well to CSS if you are so inclined.  It doesn't have the community feel of  urlLink LJ , but is now more reasonable to use than  urlLink Moveabletype  since they moved to their even more expensive 3.0 edition.    The whole Blogging/social networking thing intrigues me.  It is amazing at how fast information, rumors, gossip, and other things can travel these days via the combined might of the Internet and Blogosphere.  One wonders at how soon all of this will make conventional reporting obsolete.  Or how ling until the FCC attempts to regulate the spread of info and news stories so that it doesn't infringe upon any copyright laws or what not.  I'm not sure about any of this any more, but I'd sure like to be in the top 100 one day.  Who knows, anything is possible eh.  Ugh.  Sometimes I wish I could just be blissfully ignorant.  Perhaps then I could get on with things once in a while.  7 beers later, and it is time to go to sleep.  Secure the hatches!  Lock the gate!  Send in the reinforcements, this is going to get ugly!  Good night, I love you all, and I'll see you when the smoke clears.

      Over 300 hundred detainees (read: prisoners) where  urlLink released from Abu Ghraib today.   They say it is in order to 'thin' out the prisoner population.  I say it is order to make room for fresh meat.  Fresh humiliation fodder.  Cheap entertainment for our bored and lost boys and girls.  Who needs Bob Hope when you've got naked Iraqi's?  Looking outside at this  urlLink gorgeous day  with thoughts of prison abuse and warzone terrors coursing through my synapses once again makes me feel guilty for taking things for granted.  How dare I?  Today is a day for going to the park.  To sit back and relish in the some of the few freedoms that we are still allowed and enjoying the sun, because who knows how long it will last.  Who knows how long until the insurrection occurs?  There is talk of a draft, and I'm not talking about a stiff breeze.  If our silly child president does in fact re-enstate the draft in order to keep fresh contingents of troops on the frontlines of his little war you can bet your ass I'm getting the fuck out of here.  I've got nothing against this country, but I'll be god-damned if I'm going to fight someone else's oil war that has nothing to do with preserving basic freedoms and human rights.  I will to take flight.  Do not pass go, and you can keep your fucking $200 dollars.  Perhaps Canada, France, or I hear New Zealand is a beautiful place to live.  All right, I'll stop boring you with all of this grim negativity and manic thoughts.  Too much coffee combined with too much conspiracy makes for rabid revelations.  So, the following links and snippets will have nothing to do with Bush (maybe), Iraq, war, prisoners, or otherwise related material.  I promise.     Things You Don't Really Need to Know Before You Die:     I really want to see Morgan Spurlock's documentary  urlLink Super Size Me!   Spurlock basically ate McDonald's for every meal, everyday, and chronicled what it did to his health.  It didn't do his body any good to say the least.  In conjunction with books like Fast Food Nation this movie tackles the ever growing problem of morbid obesity that is happening these days.  Interesting to say the least.  In related McDonald's news they have decided to create the  urlLink adult happy meal.   The meal will contain a salad, bottle of water, and a lame little excercise book.  What's going to be the toy?  A beeper?  A cellphone?  Kooky!  The  urlLink Poor Man's Wi-Fi Antenna.   These wacky hackers are making extremely powerful wi-fi antenna's out of goofy household items.  Hmmm, perhaps I'll need to make one soon, I hear the one's out of Pringles cans are kick ass.  Maybe this is why Microsoft recently announced that they were  urlLink pulling out of the wi-fi game.   Hmm, anyone got a wok I can use?  Some kickass photoshopped pictures of  urlLink cyborged celebrities.   I just knew Kate Moss was a fucking robot!  A funny collection of Japanese  urlLink poop -n- scoop signs.   Those wacky zipperheads, always trying to be funny.   urlLink The ultimate video game for Bobby McFarin.   These two guys created this Myst-like game that converts inputs by biofeedback sensors by using breathing techniques to stimulate or soothe their biological responses, players can start an onscreen fire, juggle brightly colored balls and direct the flight of birds.  Check it out at  urlLink The Wild Divine Project.   Scary conceptions in technology, the  urlLink vertical farm.   Coming to a neighborhood near you, more factory farms and GMO foods.  Boy, I can't wait to eat some of that shit and grow that third arm I've so been hoping for.  Fuck Herbie the Love Bug, check this  urlLink Gilded Beetle  out.  I don't think that this little gem would do to well in the rain however.  If the police here  urlLink ever get these , I'm going to give up immediately, turn in my car, and buy a scooter.  Once the police have Lamborghini's we are definitely in trouble my friends.  What's next, pigs in jets?   urlLink The coolest material  since the advent of liquid latex.  Of course the first applications are to be for mmilitary purposes, just like velcro and the Internet....fuckers!   urlLink Robot-monkey tussle at E3!   Film at eleven!

      Oof, I've been kind of lackluster with the posting, but that is the price you pay for getting distracted by shiny, fast-moving objects.  So it is.  We had one our lovely meetings today after work, which are always o' so stimulating.  I had some time to kill between the end of the workday and the meeting so me and a few of  my co-workers went up to a local shithole to get a few beers.  Our ensuing buzz was sure to make the meeting a little more tolerable.  Well in the course of billiards and casual conversation I of course bring up Bush, the war, and the recent video of Nick Berg.  I quickly found out that the general populace is rather apposed to talking about what is happening, the truth as it were.  They seemed almost fearful of talking about, and against the things going on these days, and mind you one of those in the conversation was the indomitable  urlLink Matt .  For some reason people just seem so afraid of the truth.  I don't understand this so common and undeniable fear people have these days.  Sure I have fears, we all do.  Fear of heights, fear of the dark, fear of spiders; sure, these fears are all common.  People seem to fear talking about their leaders lying, being wrong, and that their country could in fact be the once's committing acts of "terrorism".  What I think they don't understand is that it is this fear that our leaders are, and were, counting on that has allowed them to get this far with their little campaign.  It is this same fear that allows media corporations, clothing companies, the cigarette militia, and the rest of the corporate world to control and influence our thoughts and actions.  Hell, I'm not saying that I'm immune to it, but god damn damn why be afraid to be aware of it?  It dawned on me that people seem to be so afraid of these things because talking about them and confronting them would disrupt their seemingly "perfect" little lives and peel away the veil of unreality that they are living in.  Of course I'm not saying that one has to constantly be focused on and concerned with a society and government that will lie, cheat, and steal from you in order to perpetuate their plan for more profit, but to deny the existence of said scenario just so that you can sleep a little better at night is just plain stupid.  What started all of this fear?  Was it the glamorizing of violence, crime, and government incarceration by our bought out media?  Was it the machinations of greedy polititcians who've spent more time as the CEO of uber corporations than as respectable officials of our dilapidated political system?  Or was it the Fashion & Food corp. that are on an ever constant mission to tell us what to wear, eat, drink, watch, and listen to?  Perhaps it is just us, an act of human nature that has caused this unwavering fear that is on course to destroy us.  It is evolution.  Darwinism at its most efficient.  If so, then what?  What comes next?    What's the score here?  All right, so once again I've wandered off into whining about the same shiite over and over.  Appy-polly-logies to thee and thine but these are the things that are on my mind as of late as I try to sort out all of the brutal-ness of this foul world.  I've said it once, and I'll say it again....   "Viva la Revolucion!"   Take care, love to all, and watch out for those government spooks.  They've got there eyes on you.  I'll do news, links, and BPOD tomorrow.  (Or if insomnia comes a knockin' then perhaps tonight).

      Stayed up too late last night hanging out with wine, beer, and a percocet.  Breakfast early at Le Peep with Kate, and then back home.  I fell asleep for a bit and have felt kind of groggy and lackadaisical for the better part of the day.  Took a bath, did some voracious reading, went for a walk for a little while to clear my head of all of the craziness that is going on in and around the world right now.  I'm watching  urlLink  Pumpkin   and I must say it is a bit disturbing, but an interesting movie.  I've just hit a new state of shock and disgust.  Against my better judgement I actually watched the video of the decapitation of Nick Berg.  If you think that you can stomach it  urlLink click here, and follow the instructions.   Like I said, if you don't think you can stomach please don't watch it.  You might want to watch it without sound, it might be a little more bearable that way.  This is one of the single most disturbing things I have ever seen and it sent a horrible feeling throughout me.  I can't imagine the family of this young man having to watch this, what rage and anger they must have felt I can only imagine.  I can only hope that Mr. George Bush has to watch this so that he can see firsthand some direct repercussions of the hatred his little war has created.  The fucking swine!  I'm at a bit of a loss right now.  I'm sending my love down the well.  Take care all.

      Each day I drive to work I have about a 45 minute drive to and fro, which gives me quite a lot of time to think about things.  Things like life, love, government, movies, music, politics, family, and everything else under the sun.  On this particular morning I am thinking about the world and where it is.  What is happening here?  Each day we turn on the news and we see death, destruction, and the proliferation of the destruction of the world.  And it saddens me.  In these times I often wonder if the world is worth saving.  Not that I am any kind of saviour or anything, but I'd like to think that if I try hard enough I could have some influence over change.  After watching things like   Bowling for Columbine  ,   Life and Debt  , and a few other documentaries that show us how crazy this world is getting it makes me wonder aloud:  Is it worth it?  With the powers that be in this country, who are obviously war mongers, constantly striving to cause conflicts that put money in their pockets, where are we headed?  When it seems that our 'fearless leaders' think that a war is just good business, and is good for the economy, just ask yourself.  Do I matter in this "Land of the Free?"  'We the People' have become this era's plague of locusts.  Ravenous consumers that devour all of the things around us.  Now I know how hypocritical this is of me to be ranting on consumerism as I type on my Compaq laptop and wear clothes with a company label on them, but hear me out.  We are raised on media hype. homogenized news, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and high-fructose corn syrup.  We are bred to find the latest trend, eat it up, and spit it out onto the continuing compost heap in our own backyards.  Could we be saved?  Are we headed the way of the dinosaurs so soon?  They say evolution is telescoping so that in just a few generations you will be able to see evolutionary change in a single lifetime.  Perhaps our destruction is just as telescopic.  Maybe our time on this planet is up, and we spent it on the wrong path.  Just like the dinosaurs a meteor is coming for us, only our meteor is a made up lies, deceit, war, nuclear weapons, disease, consumerism, and religious fanatacism.  It's going to hit soon unless we try and stop it.  Perhaps it is our time however.  Has the whole world gone mad?  It amazes me this political system we work with in this country.  Anyone that pays attention knows that our electorial system is bullshit, the last election proved that.  It proved that as long as your daddy has enough money and you've got a brother in charge of a key state, you can buy yourself and election.  It's all bullshit.  Everything Yosemite Bush has he owes to his daddy and his money.  Daddy bought his way into college, daddy bought his way into a baseball club, daddy bought his way into the oil industry (which helped support the families of our 'enemies'), and for the ultimate gift, daddy bought him a presidency.  Thanks dad!  And to think all I got was a little bit of money for my b-day.  What we need in this country is some radical change.  Is it possible?  Can it happen in our lifetime?  The first change that needs to happen is we need to get rid of this bullshit two-party political system.  In reality it seems like we have more of a one party system, where each 'side' takes it turn scratching each other's backs.  I call them the RepubliCrats, because that is what they really are.  All of them in the Senate and House pass bullshit bills into laws, and ones that really matter like the Amber Alert thing (which was way over do) get riders attatched to them that have nothing to do with the bill at all.  That's bullshit!  And usually said rider is either a tax increase or a pay raise for those in office.  Gee, that seems fair.  Finally these days we are starting to see some guys from the more left side of things get a little bit of respect (Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, etc.), but they are still looked at as radicals.  Any time someone from the green party, or the more liberal side of things starts to speak up they get slapped back down or are laughed at for not being "of the big two."  Are we honestly to believe that there are really only two schools of thought that each and every person is supposed to subscribe to?  Yup, that's it little Johnny, it's either A or B.  You've got to choose either the elephant's pile of shit, or the donkey's.  Sounds like a plan Sam!!  God forbid there should ever be a woman or a black man in office, that would just be ludacris.  Look at how big a deal they made over Lieberman being Jewish.  Not that I agree with his politics, but his faith seems to be a bigger deal than the man himself.  Get past the flesh people!  Why is this country so afraid of change?  At least at the top they seem to be.  Wasn't this country built on change?  If it wasn't for some "radicals" that didn't want to be presecuted for religious reasons we wouldn't be here.  Well we would but we'd all have bad teeth, bad B.O., and answer to a limey, a cocksmoker (not that there is anything wrong with that), and Yoda, Queen of England.  So, they decided to high tail to a new land and create a country of their own.  Radical thought and action led to a new beginning.  Sure they made mistakes but great men like Jefferson, Ben Franklin, John Locke, and Sam Adams (plus I love his beer) tried their hardest to make this a country and government of, for, and by the people.  I feel we've lost that.  We are no longer have a government "of" the people, but one "of some of" the people.  I think one of the biggest reasons for this is because our leaders no longer respect the Constitution, a truly beautiful document if you've ever read the whole thing.  This is why I think that the Constitution is such an amazing document made by amazing men (whom I'm sure were backed by amazing women.)  The Constitution is the "Supreme Law of the Land" written to state our way of life in this country, and how we should run it.  The beautiful thing about it is that it isn't perfect, and the men who wrote it knew this, because they knew that they weren't perfect.  That is why they made it possible to be amended, or changed, and we have done so.  The first ten amendments, our "Bill of Rights," is a testament to this statement of change and this recognition of imperfection.  Why then, have we stopped at 28 (I think, correct me if I am wrong)?  Times have changed, and so should we.  Actually not change so much, as we should grow.  I think that our leaders have turned their backs on a nation that is meant to grow and evolve in lieu of lining their pockets with money.  So what are we really to do these days?  Try to fight those in charge?  Strive for change that may never come to pass?  Or just consume like the rest of the world and live fast, make money, and die hard.  Do we let them sit there and control us with fear?  That's what they do with all of this filtered and bought news.  They cull us all with fear.  We are most certainly a nation led by fear.  How do you herd sheep?  You get a big dog that has a lot of bark to scare the herd in the direction you need them to go.  You fear them into listening.  That's what they do to the masses in this country, they fear you with tales of nuclear war, the bogeyman, and fear you into thinking that you will not be 'cool' unless you have the latest Prada/Gucci/Tommy/Dolce And Gabana/Diesel/Etc. clothes.  They've done this to us for years (ever seen the Reefer Madness movie?) and they show no signs of slowing because the rowers keep on rowing.  Our only ammo against this, is well, to stop being afraid.  We need to stop being afraid of the machine and start rising against the ones that want to keep us down.  By no means do I mean we do this in any violent way, I mean the way those in the past have inspired change, through art.  Create amazing music, wonderful paintings, beautiful poems, essays, stories, articles, limericks, anything that goes against the status quo and challenges the mind with free thought and action.  Rally the mind, rally the soul, and you rally the body into action.  Do not be led by fear.  Challenge yourself.  Challenge your mind.  And never forget that we are all amazing and beautiful people that all deserve a say so in this crazy world we live in.  And hey, if all else fails I hear Austrailia is great!!   Whew!  That sure was a mouthful wasn't it.  I'm not sure where all thay came from but there it is, take it or leave.  Good night kids, tune in tomorrow for some news, screws, and the hidden clues.

      On this road of both desperation and desolation what does it all mean?  Where are all of us meager citizens and indentured servants headed in this chaotic world?  Everyday we are bombarded by the media machine that tells us what is ‘cool’, what we should listen to, read, watch, and eat.  An environment that we ourselves created is controlling us.  Did we create the culture, or did the culture create us. 	 Conglomerates that know you only as a demographic and a number are profiting upon basic virtues of humanity like truth, honor, ethics, morals, and love.  They are sterilizing, packaging, homogenizing, and feeding us the things that are supposed to be fundamental truths within our souls.  What have we become when the very rock upon which we live tries to destroy us.  You think AIDS is just an accident?  Or Ebola?  Or Mad Cow Disease?  Or Bird Flu?  Or even natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, hurricanes, and volcanoes?  All of those things are the Earth trying to rid itself of an infectious organism, us. 	 The basic love that this society is supposed to be based upon is being destroyed in our own living rooms.  We no longer cherish love, friendship, and honor like the days of old.  Our love with the world is like having an old coat in the closet while living in a clime that doesn’t require it.  We know it is there, it looks warm, it looks like it is comfortable, and we know that it will always be there hanging in the closet.  But, we never wear it, we never feel it, we never wrap it around our bodies and let its undying warmth comfort our bodies from the harshness of the world.  We go so long without needing this coat, this love, that when we do need it, it no longer fits.  We’ve grown accustomed to not needing it anymore so now we are unfamiliar with the feeling associated with it.  We become a golem of stone, unknowing, unflinching, and unfeeling in this sterile world. 	 Each day all of us struggle to find our individual paths to what is the correct life for us.  Each day we strive to make it better than the last, but to what end?  If we make tomorrow better than yesterday, and the next day better than that, what happens when we reach the acme of all of our pleasures.  What does it gain us to try and reach out for these pleasures of life?  What good does it do us to achieve these personal victories and selfish gains?  If we are all part of the same organism, why is one limb dying while the other grows strong? 	 Do we deny ourselves the truth that we ARE part of the same organism so that we don’t have to deal with a part that is in pain?  If we admit that we are all a part of the same ‘compost heap’, does the pain of the starving in Africa, or the pain of the oppressed in the Middle East suddenly become our pain?  Are we afraid to rise to the challenge that the only way to deal with all of the pain, suffering, and death in this world is to finally come to terms with that fact that we are all a part of one collective and beautiful being?  And that all of these cultural, financial, racial, and religious differences that separate us all are utterly meaningless in the grand scheme. 	 Where are the ethics?  Where are the morals?  What has happened in the last 2,000 years that has caused great thinkers to be labeled as madmen more often than they are labeled as men of virtue and genius?  If your ideas are bold, abstract, or deviate from the status quo of thought, you are thought of as a maniac.  You are ridiculed and used as fodder for SNL skits.  What happened to people thinking outside of the box?  Now it seems that the majority only try and think of new ways to work within the box. 	 For those that do struggle against the ‘opposition’ you’ve got to wonder; was it all worth it?  For all of the fighting, hard work, and sacrificed time, does it really do you any good?  Was it worth the pain and suffering you’ve endured to see virtually nothing changed in your lifetime?  Perhaps your life would have been better spent hiking trails in the mountains or just living one’s own life away from the world.  Do we stay and try to change it for the future?  Or do we abandon it and live for ourselves away from the world that has turned on itself?  Who really knows I guess.  Okay, this is really going nowhere but downhill so I am going to stop here.  Always question the norm, always question reality, and please, always be wary of those that try and rule you.  They may seem benign, but below they might also be demons of selfishness and ego.  A great man once asked me, &#147Are there ever any truly, truly selfless acts?&#148  To this I had no answer, but it simply made me think.  Are there things we do that aren’t, in some way, personally beneficial?  Think about it, think deep.

      Stayed up late, woke up early.  Took a bath, read in the nude, and hung around the house for the better part of the morning.  I watched  urlLink Intacto  but didn't really get into it enough to give it a proper review.  I had a slight problem keeping my attention focused on the movie.  Here's the problem: now I watch almost all of my movies with the subtitles on.  Not only so that if I don't understand what someone said I can just read it instead of continually backing up, but it also allows me to do other things while I watch said movie--like browse the Internet.    The problem with this movies subtitles was that it was a Spanish movie, but many of the characters in it spoke English also.  So the subtitles only showed up for the Spanish-speaking folks, and not for about four of the other lead characters so it fucked my attention all up.  Add to that me browsing and reading things on the Internet (which I usually do with no problem) and you basically have one confused movie experience.  I did catch the gist of most of the movie though.  It had to do with luck, gambling, and these weird guys that had the power to take and give luck using some sort of "gift".  Sort of strange, and sort of hokey. So that's that.   Went to B&N of course to read, drink some more coffee, work on some CSS, sped-read a book on web usability, wrote a tiny bit, and left with  urlLink   Pigs At The Trough    by Arianna Huffington.  I've wanted to read this for a while just to check out what the woman has to say.  For some reason I don't read a lot of femal authors, fiction or non-fiction.  I wonder why that is?  Perhaps it is my natural distrust of women.  Nah, I distrust almost everyone fairly equally I think.  No exceptions.  I also read a good interview with Noam Chomsky in  urlLink   The Progressive   .  He talked about what he thinks Bush's, and the rest of the regime's agenda may be.  He also talked a lot about the United States' strange habit of not practicing what they preach and supporting conflicts that could be construed as harboring terrorists as outlined in some recent US doctrines.  Boy shit like this makes me want to move, or perhaps just try to invoke some change in this burnt out, 400 year-old burg. Read the interview online  urlLink  HERE  .       More News Snippets Than You Can Shake a Stick At     urlLink The plot thickens  regarding the Abu Ghraib abuse case.  Apparently American troops aren't the only ones losing their cool as it is revealed that some British troops have killed Iraqi civilians when there has been no obvious threat from them.  I guess I'd get kind of trigger happy too if no one could give me a straight answer as to why I'm combing the 100 degree desert in full combat gear and being shot at by people who's only wish is that we'd leave.   urlLink A whole new reason to touch yourself.   This suit, created for Phish percussionist Jon Fishman, allows you to literally "play" with yourself.  All right, sign me up!   urlLink   Bill Gates creates 'slightly-tan', and more personable clone!  Okay that isn't actually true, but look at the picture, doesn't that look like it?  This is actually Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende whose country is  urlLink shocked and outraged at the recent revelations  about what is happening in Iraq.  I guess not only that, but one of the first Dutch soldiers out of the 1,300 strong contingent stationed in Iraq was killed the other day in a grenade attack.  Currently though they (the Dutch) have no intention of leaving the country.  Hmm, I bet is hard to run on sand in those wooden shoes.  How do the Dutch do it?  One of the first, albeit a bit crappy, picture of the upcoming  urlLink Sony PSP handheld.   I bet this thing is going to kickass, but I can't see paying the potential $250 retail price.  Sure it will have Bluetooth and all that but man, that's a little too rich for my blood just to play some good games.  Hell, I still don't even have a Gameboy AdvanceSP.  Hey even I have priorities you know, like movies and beer.  I other Sony news, they have followed Microsoft's lead and have dropped the  urlLink price of the PS2 to $150.   EDIT:  I found some  urlLink Hi-Res pics of it.   The search for WMD's now extends to the  urlLink High Seas of Panama.   Suspecting that terrorists may be taking advantage of lax security on the high seas, the U.S. has been allowed to board Pananmanian flagships to plant, er I mean search for WMD's.  What's next, searching on the moon?  Mars?  My asshole?  Man, Bush and his Vulcans are really reaching these days aren't they.  I know where they can find some WMD's......COLORADO!   urlLink This guy  better be on the lookout lest he be raided and assaulted by dozens of so-called musicians a rappers (*ahem* Puff Daddy) these days that are looking  for fresh samples to rip and call their own.  If I were him I'd fortify that place like a casino vault.  Joe Bussard has 20,000 vintage 78 rpm records from the 1920s and 1930s in his basement. For $15, Joe will put together a custom cassette compilation for you of 20 tunes from his collection, perhaps the largest of its kind in the world.   urlLink The invasion begins...RUN!!   McDonald's has finally gone  urlLink too far .  Their new campaign to attract the attention of asians "living on the rim" is both insulting and insulting.  Word to all of you asians out there that want to embrace the American lifestyle stop!  McDonald's is NOT part of our lifestyle, it is an evil corporation that succeeds on greed and its disregard for its obese customers.  They are no better than Phillip Morris, the NRA, or GE.  Don't be assimiliated.   Kobe Bryant has  urlLink plead innocent to rape charges.   In this case that has been going on for a while it still boggles my mind how professional athletes get themselves into these situations.  I mean let's look at the scenario---A) You're a successfull NBA star with millions of dollars and you're only 25, B) You have a gorgeous wife, and C) Since you are a celebrity, rich, and on the road a lot you are most likely an easy target for conniving and greedy con artists.  So what does he do?  He fucks the random slut!!  Jeez Kobe, and I heard you were smart.  Whether he "raped" the woman or not, he still fucked the girl and was unfaithful to his pretty wife.  He deserves everything that happens to his dumbass, and I can't believe his wife isn't just taking his money and living the good life.  Nothing special here, just  urlLink some cool art on a really cool site.   I'm not exactly sure what this is either,  urlLink but it is kind of neat.     In yet another rash fo strange eBay auctions, this guy is selling a  urlLink certified, Ghostbusters approved, ProtonPack.   Man, some people have way too much time on their hands I say......as I continue to update, read, and comment on dozens of blogs and websites.  Hey, to each his own.   urlLink Hi-Res pic of the new dual-screen Nintendo DS.   Could this be the PSP killer, hmm somehow I think this might go the way of the Virtua Boy.  Hey, who wants to live like rockstars and go down to  urlLink this $250 million dollar casino in Hollywood, FL ?  Save your pennies boys and girls, I smell a cool roadtrip coming on where we go there all excited and ready to win and come back with empty pockets and STD's!!  Fun Fun FUN!!    All right's that all that I've got for a little while.  I feel a nap coming on, oooh, oooh here it comes. *Klunk* ............Who!? Wha?! Huh!?  Okay, I'll wait until I get away from the computer to take a nap, that might make out better and be a little less strenuos on my back and neck.  I bid thee farewell with.......     THE BUSH PIC O' DAY!!      Remembering what he learned reading 'Presidency for Dummies' George Bush quickly grabbed "The Football" when he was told that there was an issue of National Security he had to attend to.   (Okay that was stretching it a bit, I apologize.  So here is an alternate caption.)   "Duh, I'm George Bush loogit me wit dis' 'ere foosball."

      So I went to B&N, got some coffee, read some of   The Great Shark Hunt  , and checked out some magazines as per usual B&N behaviour.  I "acquired" a cool book called   The Five Biggest Lies Bush Told Us About Iraq   which seems fairly interesting.  Starting writing a bit and then realized that the place was going to close in 15 minutes, boy time flies when you're buzzing on too much coffee.  Found out that Albertsons is open until 2 AM which is interesting. You mean to tell me that, in a pinch, I can get good beer in this town at 1:45 in the morning.  Fuck!  Why didn't somebody tell me?  For anyone that wants to know (read: alcoholics) Albertsons has THE best beer selection of any regular grocery store.  Grabbed some 'Flying Dog' and sped home.  Got home, dropped a beer on the tile floor (fuck!), and am now re-watching my favorite movies, drinking beer, and doing my usual web-crawling.  My nap will prevent me from falling asleep for a while most likely, and having one less beer is going to really annoy me in about an hour.    In perusing the 'Current Events' and 'Cultural Studies' shelves thoughts of all of the ridiculous and terrible things going on this world sends me staggering backward.  From  urlLink anti-bush books , to  urlLink books from an Iraqi blogger , to  urlLink  Reefer Madness  ,  urlLink  Fast Food Nation  , and  urlLink books from the man  my head is swimming with issues great and small.  All if these amazing things that are happening in, and to this world have been boggling my mind lately.  From the atrocities of Abu Grahib, to the lies of Bush, and the foulness that corporations are wreaking upon the nation it makes me feel like I am living in a dreamworld.  Or rather a nightmare world as it were.  It sure makes you feel like the world is in total chaos.  Watching MTV today for a bit shows me how fucked up the 'entertainment' industry it is, and once again cementing my belief on how much of a negative effect this industry is having on our society.  You may think I'm being extreme, but its the fucking truth.  Look into it yourself perhaps instead of watching that latest episode of 'The Bachelor'.  Who knows, you might learn something.  I'm watching   Bowling for Columbine   and its special features currently, which doesn't help and aid my declining hope for America.  Don't get me wrong, I love this country and MOST of what it represents, but I do feel like it is definitely going down the proverbial tubes, wherever the fuck they are.   In the bookstore earlier:   A year and a few months has passed since the begining of this grim facade we are dubbing a 'war'.  Over 700+ of our boys and girls have given their brief lives for this ridiculous conflict.  Still no weapons, still no reasons, and still nothing but lies from our giddy-boy in charge Yosemite Bush.  Recent revelations about the abuse in Abu Grahib have stirred the pot as it were.  The difference is that the abuse has been perpetuated by our own, and not by the 'evil menace' that we are supposedly fighting.  Some of our fine soldiers caught red-handed via digital pictures depicting horrible mistreatment and humiliation to Iraqi prisoners.  Upon first hearing this a wave of incredible disgust and slight paranoia washed over me.  Where was I?  Were these really 'my people'?  My kinsmen?  My fucking peers?  I think fucking not thank you kindly!  The call for blood is out.  The dinner bell has been rung.  "Fire Rumsfeld!" they say.  "Resign!" comes the cries from the public.  Not so much.  Mr. Rumsfeld has taken full responsibilty for these barbaric acts, but is he punished?  Oh hell no.  Mr. Bush told him today that not only is he NOT fired, but that he thinks Mr. Rumsfeld is doing a "great job".  What?!  Are you kidding me? I......  (this is where I was cut off because Barnes & Noble needed to close).  Why can't they be 24 hours damn it?!   I know, you've heard all this from me before.  Same old BS but hey, I feel like some of it all out right now.  We are headed for disaster people if things don't begin to change.  What can we do?  To tell you the truth I don't have a fucking clue, maybe one day I will.  I know it is not healthy to dwell on this stuff but I can't fucking help it.  I'm a thinking person and I think we live in a cool world and I just hate to watch as ignorant, selfish, and ultimately fucked up people screw it all up.  I think one day I'll run for office.  Hell if Michael Moore can get on the school board at 18 and Hunter S. Thompson can run (and almost win) for Sheriff of Aspen then why not me?  I'll have to become a respected writer/journalist within the next 10 or so years, but then it is on the campaign trail I go.  I won't be Republican, nor Democrat, or Green, or even Indpendent....I'l just be me.  "Here is my platform, take it or leave it!," will be my motto. Man, I'm getting excited all ready.  And if I ever become president   will be my VP and the rest of you out there that want to be will be some of my chief advisors, along with the rest of the Neo American public.  What state has the most liberal population you think?  Let's start a revolution people.  Let's make a difference.  The time for change is at hand damn it.  I think it is time for all of us armchair revolutionaries to finally get off our asses and start doing something.  Oh fuck it, I need another beer.   Oof, okay let me get off of this jumbo-sized soapbox before I fall and smash my head upon the floor.  Where was I?  What comes next?  Who the fuck are you people?!  God bless, and I love you all.

      Today was one of those days at work that really made me feel alive you know.  Not that I made a lot of money or anything, but I worked my ass off in the afternoon despite being totally exhausted.  My partner for the day, Silent Bob, and I somehow got some miracle second wind and busting ass made the day just breeze by.  All right, enough about that, that's boring.  I was thinking about going to iBar but I doubt I will due to some newly discovered financial duress.  I may still go if   and V-to-the-D decide to come out to Orlando.  I've got movies to watch though, books to read, and writing attempts to....uh....attempt, yeah that's it.   urlLink Al Weiss  came off the boat today.  It is always kind of surreal to see someone that probably makes more money a year than I'll ever see just walking around like he owns the world.  The guy seems quite happy though, and why shouldn't he be I suppose.  I think he tooks his mother on the cruise for mother's day, at first a seemingly nice gift.  However, when your salary is in the millions why would you take your mother on a cruise that you most likely get for free?  Seems like a bit of a cheap gift-giver to me, but then again so am I when I can't afford it.  Enough about that.  All right I'm off for some wine, some blogs, some movies, and some other homebody nonsense.   Current Selection:     urlLink Elephant    urlLink Intacto    urlLink Annie Hall    See ya later fools, and I send my vibes your way.

      Oof, what happened?  I think I fell asleep or something.  Great, that means I'll be up until all hours tonight.  I suppose it is always a bad idea to take a nap at 9PM.  So I am really excited about getting that wee apartment.  This next week and a half is going to be a whirlwind of activity.  Got to make a huge list of all of the stuff I need to do to move.  For some reason it seems like I have a lot more to do this time around.  More addresses to change, more things to transfer, and more stuff to get rid of.  I really like that I am being forced to throw a lot of shit away because of my space limitation, keeps me frugal.     Late, late news schtuff:     Ok so does the whole  urlLink Mary-Kate eating disorder  thing really surprise anyone?  I mean the girl had been in the public eye almost all of her life, she's bound to have some sort of issues.  I'm just surprised they both have lasted this long with out some sort of dirt coming up.  Whatever is Ashley going to do?  These girl actually frighten me, they aren't attractive because they aren't natural anymore.  They haven't been allowed to grow up naturally.  Look at  urlLink this picture , they look fucking devilish.   urlLink Spiderman re-mix!   These are pretty fucking funny.  Just refresh for a new one, and let the hilarity ensue.  Nader wrote a letter to Kerry suggesting to him that he pick  urlLink John Edwards as his running mate .  I think that'd be swell idea.  What do you think?  Great, all right, fantastic.  Who needs money for schools, the environment, the homeless, or anything else for that matter when there  urlLink military-spendin' to be done!   The Senate approved a $416 billion bill to fund the Pentagon, $25 billion of which is going directly to Iraq/Afghanistan operations.  Hmm, I thought we 'liberated' Iraq, what else do we need to do there?  And I'm sure Osama is in a government hole somewhere just waiting to walk down the aisle around late August/early September.  So what do we need to spend that much money for?  Oh yeah, more bombs.  I guess you can never have enough bombs.   urlLink Check this shit out!    Orrin Hatch criminalizes the iPod.  With Orrin Hatch's nation-destroying Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act headed for law, EFF has decided to create a real example of just what kind of "piracy" Hatch is targetting.  This is madness people, pure madness.  I bet Hatch is just mad because he didn't buy any Apple stock before the iPod debuted and now he is just pissy.   urlLink You tell 'em Al Gore!   Or should I say President Gore?  We all know he actually won, but I'd better keep quiet lest the spooks come down on me.  So this is how our leaders  urlLink conduct themselves at those big meetings .  What was that Bush said on his State of the Union address this year?   "We must lead our children by setting a good example..."   Well you're aces so far boys, if you want the country to be full of chickenshit, greedy, war-mongering fucks that have absolutely no moral or ethical barometer and only think about lining their pockets.  Keep on truckin' assholes.  And I used to think the original Nintendo Power Glove was cool, check  urlLink the Commander Guanlet , coming to a an overpriced gadget store near you.  The first time I've ever yearned for  urlLink 23 inches .       BPOD           "All my campaign contributors over here say 'Hey'!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And all my lobbyists in the house say 'Ho!'"

          The World At Large:      How in the hell is  urlLink this monstrosity  supposed to AID in mobility.  This suit, made by UC Berkeley, is supposed to use all kinds of servso, motors, knobs, levers, hamsters, and other apparatuses to help a soldier carry more stuff.  Where is he supposed to carry said stuff when he has a battery pack thing the size of Roseanne's ass strapped to his back?  I'm sure those wacky guys over at UC Berkeley have answers to all of this, but it just seems a bit ridiculous to me.  urlLink PIC 1  --  urlLink PIC 2  --  urlLink MOVIE 1  --  urlLink MOVIE 2   Talk about  urlLink more than meets the eye .  There is something very humorous about this thing.  I like the idea that, if implemented into an office environment, each and every worker has access to a crowbar and a shovel to bludgeon their co-workers with.  You'd think they'd get some use out of the wheel spindle thingie, like a boomerang or something.  Find all the media that your little heart desires at  urlLink SingingFish.com .  I'm not sure if you can download stuff directly from here, but it shows you tons of places where a particular song, artist, movie trailer, etc., can be found.  Cool stuff.  Have you seen those 1.2 mega-pixel, 25-shot disposable digitals for $11?  Well neither have I, but they exist.   urlLink Muashammer.com  here has found a gorilla style hack to break into the camera, use a USB cable to download the pictures to your compy, and then re-use the camera.  The labor involved isn't really worth the reward of getting a re-usable digital camera that takes shitty pictures.  But hey, it'd be fun just to do it and stick it to the man.   urlLink "Were We Wrong?"  This is an article in  urlLink The New Republic  that basically states how the majority of the staff supported Bush's decision for war.  Now, like so many other proponents of the 'War On Terrorism", they are questioning their loyalty to a cause that is obviously not what they thought it was.  I find it funny that a magazine like TNR would support ol' Yosemite, what with the wealth of info I imagine they get.  Perhaps  urlLink Stephen Glass  is still cooking stuff up for them unknowingly.   "He had long-established ties with Al Qaeda."                      --Dick Cheney referring to Saddam Hussein on July 14th, 2004 in Orlando, FL.  This was just days before the 9/11 Commission declared that  urlLink there was NO Al Qaeda/Iraq link.   Nice one asshole.  This is crazy.  Not only did Sen. John McCain  urlLink reject John Kerry's offer to be his running mate , but he also told him that he will be voting for Bush.  Wha?!  So much for sticking with your party affiliation or fellow veterans.  What an asshole!  Awwww, so you can't be President and you don't wanna be Veep because that means you are second best.  Poor baby.  Fuck that guy!   "Perhaps the real posterchild of terrorism is the hyper-commodified, increasingly cosmeticized American self."  -- urlLink Richard Degrandpre ,  Adbusters  July/August 2004  I found a new news site called  urlLink Topix  that indexes thousands of news sources from around the world.  So long Google news, I've found my new source.  I'm in news heaven, weeeee!      BPOD     (Evening Edition)     Can I pet 'em?  Please let me pet 'em, pleeeease.

      Work today wasn't so bad.  Did my thang, made some $$, and came back to the p-rents house for a little Father's Day dinner.  What sucks is that my mom is cooking lobsters, and as blasphmeous as it is I must say that I hate lobster.  Hey, it's not my day though so I won't complain.  I think Wook and I came up with a million dollar idea today.  Who knows, maybe it'll come to fruition one day.    I'm sort of burnt out right now, so here's some random things from me;   urlLink This made me smile .  Hopefully next year this will be possible encounter.   urlLink Spidey goes Bollywood!      urlLink "When's gonna be my time?    urlLink The Dirty Dozen .  I think it would prove mighty difficult to avoid ALL of these corporations, but I'll try and stay away from as many as possible.   urlLink German samurai loose in Berlin!    urlLink I'd better get to see some of this when I go.   Let's hope that the Thai's aren't as riotious as the Brits concerning soccer games.  Elephants are bigger than your average limey soccer hooligan.  All right, I'm off to the ranch.  Need to do some homework and watch some movies, maybe even have a beer or three.  Tomorrow though I am jumping on the wagon, for real.  I need to feel less distracted for a little while, as well as spend a little less money.  Take care, love ya.....PEACE!!  ~Fry

      So now what, ahh yes of course....news stuff.    More fun  urlLink GI Joe PSA's   from our friends over at http://www.ebaumsworld.com.  Watch them all if you've never seen them before, and make sure you aren't drinking anything because it will be coming out of your nose.  Sadly captured American  urlLink Paul Johnson was executed .  I've just got three questions: 1)  Why didn't the military have its OWN military personel working on those Apache helicopters?  2)  What did we (the country and/or Government) do to the job market in this country that would force a guy to have to work in such a dangerous place for close to 12 years?  but 3)  Seeing as he DID live and work there for 12 years without incident, who's actions seem to be the catalyst for his capture and execution?   *cough* Bush *cough*     More great things from our  urlLink good ol' boy Bush .  Looks like Yosemite wants to systematically screen the populace for mental illnesses so he can pump people full of expensive antidepressant and antipsychotic (READ: mind control) drugs.  It is no suprise that the parent company of some of these name brand drugs, Eli Lilly, is a big Bush campaign contributor, and the Bush family has stock invested in the company.  Hell, George Bush Sr. was a member of Lilly's board of directors and Bush Jr appointed Lilly's chief executive officer, Sidney Taurel, to a seat on the Homeland Security Council.  I think you hear him knockin', and I think he's coming in.  Oh, it's big brother, better open the door.  Hey look,  urlLink Florida is in the news  for something other than botching an election, being wrecked by a hurricane, or for something Disney related.  Too bad it is still something horribly terrible.  These people should be taken out and shot.  I tell ya', the make people get breeders' licenses or something.  Check out these  urlLink punch-out chairs .  What cool freaking idea.  I want, I want.  Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and aerospace engineer Burt Rutan plan to  urlLink launch the first privately owned rocket into suborbital space on Monday.   I don't know about you, but this is hella cool to me.  Although if this is successful and they plan on commercializing it, you wonder how many people would be willing to pay X amount of dollars for a non-government sanctioned space flight.  I mean since its never been done there are no laws or safety restrictions yet made up for this type of thing.  I guess those would come with time though.  I wonder what the OS of the onboard computer is?  Madonna is now  urlLink named Esther . Uh, okay whatever lady.    Come on now Meth, did you really expect a nice, fair, and non-exploitative network like FOX to not just try and  urlLink squeeze as much ghetto out of your sitcom as possible ?  Apparently Method Man is angry, you won't like him when he's angry.  But high, however, you'll fucking love the guy when he's high.  Superfun at parties I tell ya'.  Holy crap, check out  urlLink path of drunken destruction!!   WARNING:  Lots of pics, about 35 Megs worth so I hope you gotta broadband connection.  I wonder how many people wanted to kill the guy responsible.       The BPOD!       On the count of three, turn, and FIRE!      Bonus BPOD       "I wonder if they know I just farted?"

      Hung out last night.  Did anyone else know that the entire staff of Backbooth walked out?  Arguements between the owner and manager, Andy Gurjian, caused him to walk away from his position there.  Most of the regular bar staff left with him too.  Crazy!  Supposedly Andy is looking at opening a new place, in a new location.  Boycott Backbooth!!  That's too bad though, they have the best beer selection in town.  School today.  I made two quizzes my bitch!  I've got some leads on some places in downtown that I am going to check out later today.  Hopefully at least one of them isn't in the ghetto area, I so want to live downtown.  I'm going to take pictures of the places and I'll put 'em up as soon as I can.  Sometimes life has too much starch and gets hard and itchy.  What's your Downy?   urlLink  Ich bin Ihre Heidelbeere.  Alles, das Sie tun müssen, soll bitten.      So it took them this long to find out  urlLink something we all pretty much have known for over a year now.   Glad to know so many of our resources were wasted on this pin-the-tail on the terrorist endeavor.  Now what's Bush's excuse?  The Straight Dope about  urlLink energy in a post-apocalyptict Dawn of the Dead scenario .  Better grab your shotguns and stock up on candles folks, it's not looking good.  More reasons to fear an  urlLink invasion of artificially-intelligent robots hellbent on our destruction .  Stop the insanity!!  From the people that brought you  urlLink Engadget.com  comes  urlLink Joystiq , the weblog for the videogame industry.  Nerd it up peeps, nerd it up.   New  urlLink Sony XYZ GPS Navigation  is cool as hell.  It almost looks like your playing GTA, too bad there aren't imaginary pedestrians that you can input in there so you can smash the fuck out of 'em.  FIle this under the 'Buy Me This' category.  A  urlLink local Floridian  may become the next Nick Berg.  Let's hope that this guy comes home safely.  Ooh look,  urlLink Republicans hard at work .  "Helping you profit from the death of thousands!" should be their motto.  Not only is Disney having it out with the Weinstein's regarding Fahrenheit 9/11, now they are censoring my man  urlLink Hunter S. Thompson .  Well sort of.  Thompson writes a column in www.espn.com, Disney owns Espn.  See the connection?  What next assholes?!   urlLink Ha ha, dumbasses .   "Look out a plane is flying over DC!!  Oh wait, isn't Dulles airport right over there?  Nevermind, take off your shoes and RUN!!"   Ha ha.       THE BPOD!  !     "I get the first punch!"   "No I do!" "I called first dibbs, let me at that fucker!"

      [from yesterday]  Finally home from work, what a long day.  Up at 4, on the road by 4:30, start at 6(AM), end at 5, work meeting until 6:30, yeah, that's that.  I need to stay in, relax, and do some stuff tonight but damn it that freaking    urlLink Suicide Girls Burlesque Show    is going on at Backbooth again and I must say my curiousity is getting the better of me.  Anyone else thought of going?  It could be fun, or could be just a bunch of creeps looking to get a cheap thrill.  Hmm, decisions decisions.  Going to look at a few more places tomorrow.  Like I asked before, does anyone have access to a teleportation device?  I do so hate to move, it is such a pain in the arse unless you are moving to someplace that you are going to own.  Although actually I wouldn't know because I've never bought a house or a condo, but I can speculate damn it.  Did you know that ground beef, especially that which is meant for fast food establishments, has a certain percentage of shit in it?  Crikey mate, it's a bloody turdburger!  I smacked the shiite out of my head on a steel bar today at work and now I have a big knot on my forehead.  I feel like I got in a brawl or something.  A couple more scars and a bad prison tattoo and I'd look as tough as a coffin nail.  Fuck it kind hurts though, yeah, real tough right.  Gas prices might start to drop soon.  I actually saw $1.89 at a place near here, which is the cheapest I've seen it in a while.  I never thought I'd have to say that.  Why when I was a kid you get a gallon of gas for a nickel and 1/5th of moonshine.  Okay maybe not, but I remember when I could get gas for less than a dollar, and then being mad when I saw it getting to be like $1.05 and shit.  Now I'd kill for that price.  No really, I would, just show me who I have to kill.  I'm thinking it's a monosyllabic name that sounds kind of like Toosh.  Can you be arrested for saying that?  Are the spooks listening you think?  Did the Gore's ever get their way?  Let's hope not, or else I'll be in the back of a black Suburban within the hour.  If my  urlLink VSE  stocks were real I'd be up $9,000 bucks.  Too bad it's not, but I can tell you that Apple (AAPL) has been on the steady rise since the release of the iPod Mini.  Sirius (SIRI) is also another good one to look at, it's cheap and rises and falls a lot.  So if you buy and sell it at the proper times (with say around 1,000) shares, you can make an easy couple of hundred dollars every other day.  For those that got money, check it out.  And go to VSE to try your hand out at the market with zero risk, because it's not real money.  It seems that   The Passion of the Christ   has become the  urlLink Passion of Mel's Pocketbook .  Just trying to spread the word eh Mel?  Sure you are, tell us another one Riggs, we know you're crazy anyhow.   urlLink Stuck In A Room With R2 , a song from the upcoming short film  urlLink Imperial Dogs .  How cool is this?  Oof, I gotta run.  Take care all, and later.  ~Fry

       Well wandering around the streets of downtown with no AC is definitely something I do not recommend.  Most of the places I checked out that were in my price range were pretty ghetto.  In fact one of them I just kept on driving by for fear of getting shot.  I checked out a lot of the side streets for some more secluded rental places to no avail.  There is still one place near Curry Ford Rd. I need to call because for some reason there was no one in the leasing office, and there is another place not to far from here that I am checking out on Friday.  I really hate doing this shit, but it must be done.  Where to next?  I think I want to go and get a pasta bowl from   Macaroni Grill   tonight, and maybe catch a movie.  I finished watching   Barfly   late last night.   Not bad, although it doesn't really go anywhere, but that's just the Bukowski-ness of it I suppose.  Stopped by the bookstore for a break from the heat, and of course found a bunch of books I want to get.   Among the notables are   Diamond   by Matthew Hart.  It's all about the diamond trade and how DeBeers is less of prominent jewler and more of a mafia cartel that just happens pretty much corner the diamond market.  It has always been my contention that the entire diamond trade is a sham.  If they are so rare, and so precious, then how come there are enough around to splatter on everything MC Fuck-A-Duck can get Jacob the Jeweler to put them onto?  It seems to me as if they big diamond companies are just preying on the ignorance of the general populace.  Plus, to me it seems as if science could find a better use of the hardest for of compressed carbon in the known world than to make a $250,000 watch out of them.   I also want to get   Fat Land   by Greg Crister. It's pretty obvious what this book is all about so I won't go into the details.  I just figure since America is known as the fattest country in the world, and I'm not talking P-H-A-T, that I'd learn the why's and the how's of how it all happenend.  Seeing so many obese Americans probably doesn't really help in quest to me tolerant of those around me.  Really though, I see some fucking really disgusting people coming off of that ship.  And what do they talk about when they come off,  "The buffet, the buffet, the buffet.....!"   They pay $10,000 for their family to go on a cruise down to the beautiful Caribbean and sometimes Mexico and all they care about is gorging themselves on the buffet.   They also just released the paperback version of Frank Owen's   Clubland  .  This is sort of the third-party account of the events of  urlLink   Party Monster   , but goes into more detail about Limelight owner Peter Gatien.  Even though I hate the whole club culture and all that Special K fueled hedonism, but it is interesting to read about.  To watch these kids with nothing basically create their own world where they are Gods and Kings, but as with all kings they must fall.  If you haven't seen the aforementioned movie yet I'd recommend it, even if you've never stepped foot in a club or ingesting something more recreational than Aspirin.  With all of this reading and browsing at the bookstore you'd think I'd be a little more inspired to write lately.  Well you're right, I am.  The problem is everytime I sit down to write I get all backed up quicker than Fat Bastard's toilet.  Then I hop on LJ and proceed to drone on about books, movies, and politics.  Who knows, maybe one day I can do like  urlLink Wil Wheaton  and get a book deal from my blog/s.  He got a four-book deal based solely on the writing in his blog, but I imagine they were also influenced by the fact that he'd been in movies and on TV since he was a teenager.  Who knows, one can only hope.  What I need to do is increase my readership a bit, so now I am going to do some shameless self-promotion.  If anyone out there thinks that at least some of the stuff that I post about and say is the least bit interesting, and know someone else out there that you think would also, don't be afraid to point them this way and ask them to drop me a comment or two, or five. Anyway, on to stuff.

      Wow would look as this, its been so long, my how you've grown.  I don't know why I've been so lacking in the post department lately, just busy with school and life nonsense I guess.  Please forgive me, it won't happen again--just kidding.  Last night was a lot of fun.  Adam and I went iBar, got bored with it, went to BBQ, I went back to iBar a few times, jumped back and forth a few times.  Good times, good times.  Danced with strangers, made some acquaintances, drank like fish (well fish that live in alcohol anyhow), and stumbled our way home with pieces of Planet Pizza in hand.  You know as much of a solo guy that I am it is much more fun to go out when you've got a wingman, and I can think of no one better than  .  He is definitely the Goose to my Maverick, and I the Laurel to his Hardy.  Cue the buddy music!  After work yesterday I went out with some guys for a few beers because It was this guy's b-day and on the way home I broke my vow.  I had a little buzz and was hungry so I got a Wendy's Spicy chicken sandwich, my only true vice...well that and beer...and the Internet,,,and LJ...uh, and heroin (kidding).  Even with reading   Fast Food Nation  , well I'm still reading it, I couldn't resist.  I gave in to temptation and suckled at the proverbial teat of the fast food industry. Never again however, must go and see   Supersize Me   this week.  Show of hands on who wants to go next Sunday (lj user="raptorgirl",   I know you all are still game I hope)?    Everyone should panic because a tape has been translated that warns the U.S. of  urlLink an attack on Western airlines and other transportation .  Ok now say you plan on smacking a co-worker in the head, do you tell them ahead of time?  Hell no, you just do it when the time comes and then await the counterstrike.  Why would al-Qaeda "warn" the U.S. of its intention to do this or that?  Why telegraph such a move?  It would also seem only logical that this assumption should be made by our leaders and officials at all times, tape or no tape.  The threat has been there for over a decade, but now we are going to adjust ourselves depending on the release of   al-Qaeda's Super Sounds of Terrorism Vol.1   and subsequent releases.  It is all fucking  urlLink scare tactics  people.  Tactics to control our thoughts and actions by a malicious and greedy government.   The  urlLink Pope-mobile rides again .  Pope John Paul II rides again, this time visiting Switzerland and a few other countries.  The whole Pope thing intrigues me.  Now I'm not a wholly religious guy, but you've got to marvel at someone that can devote his life to such an esteemed position.  I bet his parents are so proud.  Since the Pope is supposed to be the only human in direct contact with God, I wonder if he has regular conversations with the big guy?  Like,  "Hey God, where did I put the remote?" , or  "Hey God, did OJ do or not?  Come on, you can tell me, I'm the Pope for crying out loud."   If you could ask the Pope one question, what would it be?   urlLink The G-8 Summit will take place  this week.  No, the G-8 is not a basketball tournament or a rap group, is a meeting of the leaders from the 8 major industrialized nations.  What a place for a terrorist attack eh?  Especially when they plaster the location all over the news, Internet, and like media.  It seems that Mr. Bush is going to be seeking endorsements from other nations is his 'War on Terror 2004' campaign.  I hope they dis his ass.  This would be an interesting thing to sit in on, fli-on-the-wall style, although I bet I'd be thoroughly disgust me.   urlLink Brothel for sale!  Brothel for sale!   The famous 'Chicken Ranch' in Las Vegas is up for grabs for the low, low price of only $7 million bucks.  Who wants to pitch in so that we can own some stake in some whores?  How do you list this type of thing in the classifieds?  Business for Sale.  Up and running seller of "professional services" for sale.  Strong customer base already established as well as experienced employees.  Come in for a test drive!  Yours for the low low price of only $7M, plus all the whores you can jab a stick at!  Hey, I'm up for it.   urlLink Lost city of Atlantis?   Or not?  Supposedly some satellite photos are showing something off of the coast Spain that may prove to be the fabled 'Lost City of Atlantis' of mythological lore.  Don't know why, but I thought I'd point this out.  It'd be neat if this were true, but we'll have to wait and see.   For the first time in 28 years a  urlLink racehorse was up for the coveted Triple Crown .  The Triple Crown is when a horse wins the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and the Belmont races.  The horse in question was Smarty Pants, but alas this was not his time for he lost to .  I am normally not a big horse racing fan, but for some reason I watched this and it was quite interesting and exciting to watch.  I bet some people in Vegas made a buttload of money from this upset.   urlLink Night Rider gets clipped .  David Hasselhoff jailed for DUI.  For some reason I find this satisfying, I've heard that Mr. Chest here is kind of a dick to the rest of the population.  Justice is served.   urlLink Cool Maria Wars deathmatch game.   Play at your own risk.   urlLink More fun with PhotoShop .   urlLink Robotic house construction  could be used to "print" houses.  I don't know about you but it seems like more and more we are making it a possibilty for things like  The Matrix  or  Termniator  to come to pass.  I'm telling you people, as much as I like robots and technology, this is dangerous territory.   urlLink This movie is going to fucking rock!   Zombie movies rule!  Okay, enough is enough.  Here's the    BPOD   ....       President George Bush displayed his skill with the 'difficult to play', as he called it, Air Trumpet to a stunned crowd on Friday.

           Food for Thoughtlessness from the FNN:       For most of you this is not going to be all that cool, but I think it is pretty keen.   urlLink Design By Fire's   Andrei Herasimchuck held Round 2 of his  urlLink Gurus Vs. Bloggers  tournament.  This pits 7 Web (design) Gurus against 7 prominent bloggers and rates them against each other based on site usuability, accessability, and design.  For some reason I find it fascinating that the bloggers have completely shut out the Web Gurus in both rounds, and for the most part it is easy to see why, even if you aren't a design major.  One example is  urlLink Nathan Shedroff's  site, who was on the guru side.  For someone who has been a designer for 12 years, authoring books, and speaking at conferences, this site is horrendous in my opinion.  From the tiny font, to the low contrasting colors, and the shitty navigation everything just screams annoying.  Bloggers rule!  Okay, you can back to regularly scheduled, non-nerdy post.   urlLink 500,00 people protested Bush's visit to Rome  today.  What a surprise that our lovely leader isn't very welcome in other countries of the world.  I can't wait until he goes to France later on, I hope he gets spat on.  Maybe this time of thing will help and send him a message, GO BACK TO TEXAS YOU FUCK!  What do you make of  urlLink this clip ?  It shows some Americans (I think) getting shot at in some Middle Eastern country, fighting back, and then fleeing in a jeep with missles in tow.  Shocking video or clever marketing ploy?  You be the judge.  Check out these little wall-crawling  urlLink spy bots .  Hey, for only $14K these little babies can be yours.  Sort of reminds you of those things in that movie  urlLink Runaway  with Tom Selleck.  Where's Gene Simmons when you need him?   urlLink Another top-level CIA resignation  occured today.  It's about time we've seen some changing of the guard in the upper echelons of our government agencies.  I wonder who will be applying for the job?  Okay I like Ray Bradbury and all but  urlLink him getting all mad over the title of Fahrenheit 9/11  is totally ridiculous.  For someone who writes sci-fi, one of the most copied genres in fiction, I can't believe he is pissed about something as simple as a title.  He should be flattered damn it.  I sure hate it when people I look up to turn out to be jerks.  I hate celebrity gossip but this caught my eye, Lindsey Lohan's father was arrested  urlLink on an assault charge  Thursday.  He apparently assaulted his brother-in-law at a first communion party (there are so many things wrong with that).  No doubt Mr. Lohan was defending the authenticity of his daughter's bouyant chest.  Bet you didn't know that  urlLink Jesus was a pharmacist .  Who knew the son of God was peddling Viagra, Soma, and Prozac these days.  Here's your  urlLink Friday Flash!   Enjoy.  Well then, that's all I suppose.  Let's go ahead and get it over with, I promise this won't hurt a bit......   .....the    BPOD!!

      One Thai chicken pizza.  One-half season of   Curb Your Enthusiasm  .  And now I've got a few beers to kill as I study for a test and scour the web.  I didn't realize it until just a bit ago that I need to make it to a VCC testing center by 11AM tomorrow in order to take a test for my online e-business class.  I also need to do some bank stuff, get another haircut (a trim from the other day, I'm going to cut it even more extreme), and if I have time look for a new apartment.  Any suggestions for something near Downtown for one person (who can live modestly) in the $475-$525 range?  I've got one lead, but we'll see how that goes.  I have a love/hate relationship with moving. I love moving to a new location and setting up a new place, but hate the actual moving process; packing, tossing stuff out, loading, unloading, etc.  Anyone have access to a teleporter?  If so that'd be great.     Comedy as old and flaccid, yet still as funny as grandma's arm flaps:     CIA Director  urlLink George Tenet resigned today .  Supposedly he was just "fed up" with things, but it is obvious that he is feeling a bit awful and guilty after the whole botched use of pre-9/11 intelligence.  Who wouldn't feel bad about being known as the guy who may have been able to prevent the deaths of thousands of Americans?  Maybe we should get another cross-dresser in there instead of such a  urlLink sickly looking guy .  This is an interesting  urlLink little art exhibit .  It is strange the direction art has taken.  When you can make some super-hero PJ's, hang them on a wall, and they can call it artistic expression.  I don't know, I think this is a little more interesting than that guy who put cheese all over that hotel room.  Holy shit, a big-ass  urlLink great-white shark  was spotted off the coast of N/S Carolina.  This, while not totally uncommon, does not occur very often.  This leads some scientists to believe that the giant predators are perhaps starting to change their migratory patterns.  Wouldn't that be some shit if one turned up off of the coast of Florida?  I bet it'll happen soo.....THE APOCOLYPSE IS NIGH!!  So the senate has gone and approved  urlLink $25 billion for military Iraq operations .  Great.  Schools are falling apart, the environment is being wrecked, you have to sell an organ for a gallon of gas, and we are going to spend more money on the war machine....ROCK! The scary part is that the vote was 95-0 in favor (obviously).  What the fuck?!  Are our Senators afraid to show a little dissent from what is expected.  Go against the grain!  Show the majority that they aren't always right damn it.  One day I want to be a politician, just so I can be NOT like the rest of the assholes out there.  Of course I would never be voted into any office because the American people prefer morons over great men.  Did you hear?  There is a rumor that our own Mayor Buddy Dyer may be GAY!  I don't have a link for this and the Intel is as flimsy as a deadman's weiner, but hey...rumors rule!  I don't know how much this matters but I figure I'd mention it.  Who knows, maybe if I mention it here some Orlando Government-issue web spiders will scour this and report me to the highest available authority.   urlLink MJ off the hook  from new child abuse charges.  Good for him.  Poor Jacko, I want to still like the guy but damn it is so difficult when things get like this.  I think that Michael is just a product of a really fucked-up childhood that has never really been dealt with, but only glossed over with oodles and oodles of money.  Like I've said before, America just loves to see a star fall from the sky.  Since I am watching   Curb Your Enthusiasm   I thought that this was kind of interesting.  A man in California was  urlLink found innocent of murder charges  because he was seen in the background of the popular HBO sitcom.  As it turns out, his only alibi on the night of the murder in question was some footage of him in the crowd of a baseball game.  Isn't that some good-ass luck.  The thing is, the guy is clearly innocent, yet if that evidence hadn't surfaced the guy would have gone to jail and possibly executed for a crime he didn't commit.  How about all of those other deathrow inmates who weren't fortunate enough to find themselves in the background of popular network sitcoms?  Makes you rethink the death penalty doesn't it.   urlLink One of the hardest flash games EVER!   This can't be true.  Apparently Microsoft is trying to  urlLink patent the double-click .  Come on now, this is totally ridiculous.  That's like trying to patent the fingersnap.  *SNAP*  That is all, except for the terrible yet obligatory.....   .....   BPOD   !!    "So explain this again Mr. Tenet.  I put my right foot in, THEN I take my right foot out......"

        Finally, something other than his inane prattling:    Check out these three things.  This  urlLink bag stains itself  when it detects a nearby cellphone call.  It doesn't un-stain itself, but it slowly stains more and more as it is in proximity of more calls.  One day at a college campus and it would look like the bag had it's period.  These  urlLink jackets let you make a call  only when you do something special, depending on the jacket.  This  urlLink hat is, well kind of stupid .  It has headphones in the ears, but just looks really gay.  Can you say   Gummo 2K4  ?  All three of these things are supposed to be a form of experimental art in an attempt to show the affect of technology on social interaction.  Interesting, but stupid no?  A  urlLink new Miss Universe has been crowned .  Not that I care.  Isn't it a bit stupid to call it the "Miss Universe" pageant when really it is only the Miss World competition?  I mean, where are the representatives of Mars, Planet X, the Vulcans, the Klingons, and the ALF's?  Until we see some aliens doing talent competition, I don't think they should be allowed to call it such, same goes for the Mister Universe competition.  On another note, how come the Miss Universe thing is a beauty pageant, and the Mr. Universe is strictly for bodybuilders?  Shouldn't Mr. Universe be an all around amazing person?  I think they need to revamp this shit, pronto!   urlLink More idiocy from our Commander-in-Thief .  Now he is likening the "War on Terror" to the "War Against Tyranny" waged during WWII against Nazi Germany.  Um, no, somehow I don't think the millions of dead Jews would agree.  The thing is, terrorism does not exist on it's own.  Something has to start the fire, something has to trigger it, there must be an initial catalyst.  Conservative politics, guys like Bush, Cheney, or companies like Halliburton and ENRON, and all of their ilk are the things that cause terrorism.  The origins of most terrorist groups have no doubt blurred into obscurity, but I'm sure most of them can be traced back to one event that bred this hate.  These groups didn't just Spring out of the ground, someone made them mad.  They don't hate us because of the "freedom" we have or that they envy our way of life, they hate this country because people like Bush  THINK  that they envy our way of life.  I could go on, but I won't.   urlLink Way to try and keep morale up .  If this keeps happening you are going to start getting a bunch of washouts ala    Catch-22    style.  Guys (and gals) are going to get sick of being there and certainly aren't going to want to kill anymore, which will cause them to get careless.  More and more soldiers will die, and then more will be sent over.  You know, maybe this war was designed as sort of a U.S. population control, oooh conspiracies abound.  Woohoo!   urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 has been bought  and will be distributed by the Weinstein's in a deal with Lion's Gate and IFC films.  ROCK!!  The supposed date of release is set for June 25th, but we'll probably have to wait a bit to get it here.  I can't tell you how happy this makes me...JOYGASM!!  Why in the fuck is Bono like the  urlLink ambassador of music ?  The guy seems to be the one to address the pope, and he meets presidents, and now he addresses the EU.  He's in a fucking band!!  Who the fuck is he to have any influence of over policy?!  Whatever, that is the world I guess.  More stuff about the  urlLink Rance mystery .  Hmm, the plot thickens.  Welcome to  urlLink The American  Cornhole  Association .  It's not what you think, but is just as bizarre.    And with that, I will take my leave for a bit.  But not before this.......    ....the    BPOD   !!    "Geez George, did you fart?  Did you fucking fart?!  DID YOU FUCKING FART GEORGE?!"   (Bonus points for anyone that can guess what movie that was from, with a slight alteration to the name.)

      Often times in every person's life they find themselves sitting someplace and thinking about all of their actions; past, present, and future.  Thinking about the past usually leads to small bouts of disappointment, thinking about the present usually leads to second-guessing oneself , and thinking about the future is usually a good catalyst for depression.  What and where you are, are usually never really in line with what you'd much rather be. 	 We think about our place and role in the world and laugh about the utter futility of it all.  What does it matter if I am rich, married, happy, or sad when the world is as fucked up as it is?  What's the point?  How did we get here?  Then again, who cares?  There is really no point in sitting around and dwelling on things that we have no ability to change.  Get over it.  Move on.  Keep on truckin'!  Let the rest of the bastards worry about that stuff, you've got bigger fish to fry. 	 Or do you? 	 It sometimes seems to me that the experiment has failed.  It's time to pack it up, ship it out, and make room for then next test subject.  We've had our time, and it seems we have ruined it.  In only 2,000 years we have managed to be well on our way to destroying something that has been in existence for millions of years.  Free will, our greatest gift given to us either by nature or by some faceless god, it seems has gotten the best of us.  I'm not sure where I am going with this, but it's going. 	 Then again thinking about all of this does me, or you, no good.  The bigger question is: What do you want to do about it?  Should we forget about it, move into the mountains or forests and live out our days in harmonious isolation?  Or do we join the ranks of the masses and try and change the world for the better, be it now or for future generations?  	The beauty is gone. 	 	We are the lost.  	Searching for an “X” on a treasure map that does not exist.  We are sifting, drifting, waiting for an answer when there are none. 	 	Go home.  Look at yourself.  Feel the lies.  Feel the filth.  	Man the battlements, the war is on. Then again, perhaps it never stopped.  	It is all so fucking beautiful, so fucking scary, and oh so fucking hilarious.
