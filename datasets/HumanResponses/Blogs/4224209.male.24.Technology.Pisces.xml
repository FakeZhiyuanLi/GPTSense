       T-Mobile do my head in. I mean that with all my heart. They're a true BUDGET network what I mean by this is that only a small population of the country are really that poor that they just have no choice but to go with T-Mobile.      Allow me to explain. I called T-Mobile last night for the 5th time to try to get access to my voicemail, a trivial task for many other networks but not for these guys! When you call T-Mobile there is no option to actually talk to a human being. If the electronic voice prompts don't cater for your needs you are supposed to just hang up but I found a way around this, press the button to report your phone stolen and you get straight through to someone. Orange, Vodafone and O2 have options to talk to someone but not T-Mobile!      I spoke to someone at 9PM last night. He informed me there was nothing he could do for me. He couldn't even access my account details because the system was being upgraded. I asked if there was anyone else that could help me but there wasn't, EVERYONE'S SYSTEM WAS BEING UPGRADED. I didn't believe him so I diligently hung up and called back and got through to someone else but lo' and behold I got the same answer. I would have to call back after 7am to get Customer Services. After complaining for a bit the T-Mobile representative informed me that I was "paying for the network and not for the customer service".      So when T-Mobile systems are being upgraded there is no provision to cater for any customers that may have a problem. I used to work at a small company when I was 16 which had an employee base of 23. I remember one day the coffee machine was being fixed and while they were doing this they had temporarily installed another coffee machine for people to use.

      During a recent conversation with one of my fellow comrades he informed me that he thought the pic of Nat Chanapa (see below) posted earlier looked as if she was a ladyboy. Blooded. Dude, tell me does  urlLink this  look like a ladyboy!!!  I ain't no ladyboy lover or nothing but THAT ain't no ladyboy.....belee dat son belee dat.  UPDATE: I'm a man who admits when he's wrong. Upon studying the picture I posted below I believe the picture does give off the tell tale signs of ladyboy features. But she aint!!

      So I went to see the new Will Smith blockbuster a couple of days ago and what can I say except that I will never learn. Everytime I give old William a chance he seems to throw it back in my face. This film is an absolute waste of time. His acting? Stiff. The effects? Half the film looks like a damn cartoon; it won't exactly make you leave the cinema making comparisons to Lord of the Rings or even Wallace and Grommitt for that matter! The story? There is one there somewhere but who gives a crap after you consider the first two points.  I personally believe ol' William Smith whould have stuck to his trusty Fresh Prince of Bel Air. The program was made for him and it showed. As soon as he hit the big screen I believe he has been unable to adjust his acting appropriately. I'm no hater though I give credit where it is due and William was excellent in Ali which is what lead me to pay Â£6.50 (well Â£3.25 thanks to Orange Wednesdays) for this film.  But this time I swear, had on my heart, I will never go to see another Will Smith movie again.

      Today is, in some respects, a sad day. Back to the Future is being shown on the big screen in Greenwich Park this very evening...for free! Courtesy of our friends Stella Artois. Provided the weather holds up it should be a good evening. However, I shall not be able to go as I will be working on my dissertation!  For those of you interested here are a few more details  urlLink here . Let me know how it was if you do get to go.

      Well I've finally got the hang of this blogging hoopla and I'm starting to wonder why i didn't start doing it earlier!  Well my first week of work was interesting. I've rejoined my old work place after a 2 year absence and things have definitely changed for the best. Most importantly the company name has changed to something that sounded alot better than before! Jokes aside there have been some institutional improvements and it's a very exciting time to be in the company. I can see myself being there for alot longer than I initially thought I would be. The first two days were a little slow, but thats expected, by Wednesday I was already jetting off to Southampton! I've been assigned to an interesting project which I'm not really allowed to talk about ;)  Ive got Thursdays and Fridays off until the 6th September to do my dissertation which frankly hasn't taken much shape. To my relief I was talking to a few of my mates and it seems as though they are in pretty much the same position which relieves me for some reason but doesn't help my position in anyway! I aim to have a big chunk of it done before the weekend finishes.

      I'm sure there have been millions of Blog's that have had this title at some point or other so I figured why ruin a good thing!  I have no idea what sort of direction I aim to take my Blog into but hopefully time will reveal all. Who knows I may want the entire planet to view it or I may just keep it nice and private for myself.  Will be posting again soon!
