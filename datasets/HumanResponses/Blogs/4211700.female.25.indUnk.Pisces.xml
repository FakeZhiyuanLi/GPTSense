      I've been pondering the best solution to a small problem presented to me recently. To make it more objective, I have converted into a cute little story.  There are two fieldmice, a boy mouse and a girl mouse. Let's call them Timmy and Milly. Timmy and Milly consider themselves as friends, and get on very well but they don't know each other all that well. Despite this, Milly develops strong feelings for Timmy and thinks about him constantly when they are not together. Timmy, being a typical male, is oblivious to all this.   Milly is faced with a problem. Does she admit her feelings for Timmy and potentially ruin the friendship she has with him, or does she keep them to herself? There is only the most remote possibility that they can get together.  Now being the cynic that I am, I personally believe that Milly would be extremely selfish to confess to Timmy that she likes him. Given the unlikelyhood (did I just make up that word?) of a real relationship between them, there is nothing to be achieved by it apart from Milly easing some of the tension she feels. Their friendship would become more awkward, and maybe even cease to exist.  On the other hand, what if they are the perfect match? What if, by not saying anything they drift apart for some other reason and lose that chance of real love?  If I were a guy then I might be better able to provide the answer. Is friendship or love more important to a guy? Answers on a postcard.

      As I opened my eyes this morning to another champagne hangover, I was hit by the sudden realisation that the circle of life (at least in my case) begins in the Light Bar, revolves around the Light Bar and most undoubtedly will one day  end  in the Light Bar.  Though not the scene of my fondest memories (that would be the nearby Poet), I cannot recall a single occasion where I did not stumble out of this alcohol den having entered whilst the sun had not long disappeared and left with the distant callings of the last Tube train home ringing in my ears. So cheers to Dave, my friend and colleague - and Happy Birthday once again.

      A colleague e-mailed this link yesterday and said "There is hope for you yet".  urlLink http://drue.com/writings/   The article is called How To Love A Geek Girl.  Funny but I never really considered myself a geek. It's true that I am a "programmer" (I always preferred the term "Developer" but let's not be pedantic), it's also true that I do spend a lot of time in front of a PC, whether at work or at home. Yes I have had very techie dreams about linux servers. And ok I do have an obsession with Neverwinter Nights at the moment. I don't think it's conclusive though.  Damn. I don't sound convincing even to myself.

      I seem to spend minutes on end staring at Flip Flap, a solar powered plant that sits on my desk at work. It's very calming but after a while, it can cause strange thoughts to pop into your head. Despite this, I love it so I wrote a little ode as a tribute.   How peaceful you are, your graceful swaying from side to side In perfect harmony to the palpitations of my heart Like me you are dependent on the light To remain the gentle being you are Dearest Flip Flap, keeper of my wistful daydreams, Timeless constant, I give thanks for your solidarity and simple wisdom.

      Six minutes of my life just passed by. Seems more like twenty. It’s late, nearly 2am. I’ve worked more than a 50 hour week and had less than 6 hours of sleep a night this week. I don’t really want to be here, but I don’t really know where else I want to be. I feel exhausted, but at the same time, restless. What do I need to do? My life is full of mundane things at the moment, work, planned holidays, financial matters that I need to take care of. So much clutter. So many things, belongings, responsibilities. I need to offload some of it. It’s now August. I still have time. I can make it a New Years Resolution. In fact, I  will  make it a New Years Resolution. I can apply  minimalism  to my life. I think I now know what I need to do – and knowing that, I can finally go to bed. Oyasumi.

      I love the days where I have nowhere in particular to be. Life is suddenly full of possibilities. If a stranger asked me out for a drink, I could potentially say yes, without disappointing anyone else. I could be walking along a road and just stop - and watch the rest of the city hurrying along to meet their weekend. I always thought that I owed it to myself to maximise my time. I seem to make such an effort to do this that I tend to forget to enjoy the moments :)   It's been a strange couple of weeks. I feel as if I've reached the parapet and I'm peering over it at the beautiful view spread out before me. Only I'm terrified of heights and don't know which way to look. I know that if I can just let go of my fears, all my obstacles will dematerialise. But if I turn back, the road leads to certain safety. Do I walk or fly?

       It's my dad's birthday tomorrow.     Last night in my dream I was struggling to think of what to do for his birthday - where we could take him to celebrate. I had a sudden flash of inspiration - swimming at Fantaseas, an indoor waterpark that has waterslides, rapids and all that sort of thing. It was very close by,in Lakeside Retail Park, in between Miller Brothers and the UCI Cinema.   [In actual fact, whilst this retail park does exist, as does Miller Bros and UCI Cinema, there is nothing in-between them, and there is no waterpark anywhere near Lakeside at all. Fantaseas did used to exist, but it sat somewhere off the M25and has long since shut down]   Anyway, we ended up driving to Fantaseas and found out that it was now called Equilibrium. I got out of the car and realised that I had somehow forgotten to bring my swimming costume. Luckily for me, my brother remembered that I could buy sportswear at a massive shop called Wilkinson Sword (?!) so off we went.On the ground floor of this shop they sold an absolutely incredible range of Anime merchandise, cuddly Totoros, Gundam, trading cards, it was all there. My brother and I had a heated argument about whether the goods were cheaper in this shop than in Japan/Hong Kong and we traded nonsense prices at each other.   I didn't think any of this was at all strange but I will never know whether this shop actually sold swimwear, or indeed, if I managed to buy anything becausethe next thing I knew, I was strolling through the door of Equilibrium looking for the ticket counter. We wandered through some unusually dark corridors and passed many many doors - much like a hall of residence. There were girls strolling between the roomswith hairdryers and mobile phones, some still dressed in their pink pyjamas. I didn't think this was strange either. It's funny how the oddest things that happen in dreams just seem normal at the time.    Unfortunately I never got to do any swimming as my mobile phone alarm went off and woke me up. I also think it's unlikely that I will be going swimming tomorrow on my dad's birthday.

      I live on dreams.  That delicious moment when your mind begins to regain conciousness and fragments of your dream replay themselves across your closed eyelids. Your dreamstate emotions linger momentarily,  frissons  of fear, relief, passion, excitement.  What controls my dreams? Is it a subconscious decision the brain makes to prepare oneself for real life? Can it really just be a reflection of fears and desires as the psychologists would have us believe?  Music. I never hear music in my dreams. My dreams are like playing the piano with the una-corda pedal down - muted voices and sound effects. Sometimes I cannot even tell if the characters in my dream are really talking, or if I am just imagining what they are saying inside my head. If I could choose the soundtrack for my dreams, I expect it would be mostly classical and jazz. I'd have Nina Simone for when I'm prisoner in a triad gang war, Bach Minuet in G Minor for when I'm wandering lost in the school I went to as a child and maybe Tchaikovsky's Valse des Fleurs for those moments when I've saved the Universe from certain destruction :)  I saw Derren Brown a few months ago live at the Palace in London. I was suitably impressed with his ability to influence so many people with his subtle (almost smarmy) charm. It makes me wonder - if he can so easily influence peoples' subconciousness whilst they are  aware  and, you'd have thought, in full  control  of their rational thoughts, could he do the same for when we fall asleep? Is this what hypnosis is about? And how can you tell if you're hypnotised?  .... Now I can't help thinking about Brave New World ..
